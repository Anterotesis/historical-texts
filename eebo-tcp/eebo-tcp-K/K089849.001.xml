            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have not taken up the Pen to trouble you with an Addreſs in the uſual Stile of Dedicators; to a warm and lively Imagination, ſuch as Mr. NUGENT's, Novelty will appear an eſſential Grace in
<pb facs="tcp:0311400901:4"/>Compoſition; and what Kind of Novelty can, at this Time of Day, be introduced in a Form of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which has been indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately hackneyed by the Witty, the Venal, and the Dull for ſeveral Centuries? I ſhall therefore have no Recourſe to exhauſted Topics, nor ſhall I endeavour to cull from the Stores of common Place a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-hand Garland, which would not fail to be offenſive to your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy, however, your Politeneſs might induce you to excuſe the Aukwardneſs of the Attempt. I ſhall leave it, Sir, to the City of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> to ſpeak aloud of your eminent Abilities, and to the Annals of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to diſplay the brilliant
<pb facs="tcp:0311400901:5"/>Share you have had in all public Debates, without adding the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of my feeble Voice to echo back your Fame in Dedicatory Panegyric; though I perſuade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, were I to trouble you with it, one Degree of Novelty, might be allowed me, I mean Sincerity; which I take to be a Quality totally unknown to the Offerers of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe.</p>
            <p>BUT it is not the able Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I am at preſent to addreſs; it is the Patronage of the Man of Genius, Wit and Humour my Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition has prompted me to ſolicit, and, I believe, every one will agree with me that I could not any where
<pb facs="tcp:0311400901:6"/>chuſe a Name more juſtly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for thoſe ſplendid Embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments, than that of Mr. NU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENT.</p>
            <p>I AM not inſenſible, that, in doing this, I may fall under the Cenſure of the witty Doctor <hi>Young</hi> when he ſays,
<q>
                  <l>As Pedlars with ſome Hero's Head make bold,</l>
                  <l>Illuſtrious Mark!—where Pins are to be ſold.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Truth is, I am afraid, the fugitive Pieces contained in theſe little Volumes will hardly be found worthy of your Attention; but if
<pb facs="tcp:0311400901:7"/>they are admitted to lie in any Corner of your Study, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate with myſelf that they have found ſo honourable a Shelter, and I ſhall be ever proud of having ſeized this Opportunity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing myſelf,</p>

            <p>IT is obſerved by Lord <hi>Shaftſbury</hi> that every Man, who publiſhes a Book, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes Wiſdom; but the Author of the following Eſſays begs Leave to make himſelf an Exception to this general Rule of the noble Writer. Having had ſome Reaſon to imagine that the Numbers of the GRAY's-INN JOURNAL, during its periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Publication, were not unacceptable to the Public, he determined not to leave them in their ſcattered Condition, and has therefore been at ſome Pains to collect them together, in as neat a Manner as he could, and with as many Retrenchments, Additions and Corrections as his various Avocations would permit. He has only to add, that, with all due Reſignation, he gives up Commas and Points, Errors of the Preſs, and all thoſe Inaccuracies, which <hi>Horace</hi> tells us ariſe from Inadvertency, or the Imbecillity of human Nature, to
<pb facs="tcp:0311400901:9"/>the ſmall Critics, and anonymous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteers, of whom he has given his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Eſſay, No. 88. He hopes no reaſonable Exception can be made by the Senſible and the Candid to his Sentiments in general, or the occaſional Frolicks of an aſſumed Character. It ſhould be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Remark in the <hi>Rambler</hi> is founded upon Truth and Juſtice. "The ſeeming Vanity," ſays that excellent Author, <q>with which I have ſometimes ſpoken of myſelf, would perhaps require an Apology, were it not extenuated by the Example of thoſe, who have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Eſſays before me, and by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, which every nameleſs Author has been hitherto allowed. A Maſk, ſays <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiglione,</hi> confers a right of acting and ſpeaking with leſs Reſtraint, even when the Wearer happens to be known.</q>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has been remarked by Writers, whom a Deſire of adding to the Entertainment of the Public has incited to portion out their Endeavours into periodical Eſſays, that the firſt Addreſs, in the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Explanation of their Plan, has occaſioned more vehement Corroſions of their Nails, and more frequent Rubbings of the Forehead, than any other ſucceſſive Compoſition; in like Manner as we find Men, who, upon their firſt Admiſſion into a Company of Strangers, betray ſeveral aukward Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their Deportment, ariſing from the different Ideas of Baſhfulneſs and Diffidence, which agitate their Minds until the initial Ceremonies are adjuſted. As I propoſe to hold a literary Intercourſe with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and flatter myſelf with the Hopes of converſing with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0311400901:13"/>many Hundreds of my Countrymen every <hi>Saturday,</hi> I cannot iſſue out my firſt Performance, without feeling an extraordinary Solicitude for the Event, and being diſconcerted by thoſe Alarms and Perturbations of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which are apt to ſeize People of Senſibility in their Tempers, when irreſiſtible Principles of Action have prevailed over their Modeſty, and called them forth into a conſpicuous Point of View. The firſt Impreſſion has always great Influence upon Mens Judgments, and the Mind will often haſtily form Aſſociations of Ideas, which it cannot afterwards eaſily ſeparate. On this Account I have been a not a little anxious about my firſt Appearance, and after much Contemplation and deep Study, I ſhould have been entirely at a Loſs how to ſet off, had not the Example of our parliamentary Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates pointed out a Mode of Eloquence, to which I think proper to adhere on the preſent Occaſion, as the moſt perſuaſive Rhetoric I can ſuggeſt to myſelf.</p>

Having thus declared my Ambition for literary Fame, I do not expect that all thoſe rival Wits, who for ſome Time paſt have been making their Court to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, ſhould inſtantly decline the Poll; on the contrary, I am apprehenſive, that, as it generally happens at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, much Scurrility will be diſcharged upon the preſent Writer; and I am no way doubtful but they will proceed to the Extremity of diſputing my Property in <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> and obliging me to make out my Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Of this, however, I hope to give ſufficient Proof in the Sequel; and whatever Animoſities may ariſe, I am reſolved to purſue my Courſe, without going out of the Way, like the Countryman in the Fable, to cruſh the Graſhoppers that may make a Noiſe around me. I ſhall conſole myſelf in that Caſe with a Reflection that thoſe Nuiſances are ever found in the Sunſhine.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0311400901:15"/>World muſt approve whatever they produce, and the latter imagining that Authors are obliged at any Rate to pleaſe them. For my Part, I ſhould be glad to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Matters with all the Critics of the Age; if they will abate ſomething of their uſual Severity, my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon them for Fame and Reputation ſhall not be very exorbitant; and ſhould they withhold from me that ſmall Tribute, I hope, at leaſt, they will allow me to make as much waſte Paper as the reſt of our periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Writers and daily Hiſtorians.</p>
                  <p>From the latter of theſe, viz. our common News<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, I do not perceive what Kind of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage can redound to a rational Creature, who can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receive Inſtruction or Entertainment, by reading that Mr. <hi>Such a one,</hi> an eminent Cheeſemonger, died at his Country Houſe, when perhaps he is in perfect good Health in <hi>Thames-Street;</hi> and if 'Squire <hi>Rent Roll</hi> is arrived in Town with a grand Retinue, I apprehend it no way intereſting to any Man breathing, except his Taylor, his Pimp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As there is, however, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Curioſity inherent in our Conſtitutions, I ſhall make it my Buſineſs to adminiſter to its Gratification by Articles of true Intelligence annexed to every Eſſay. In the Reſearch of theſe I ſhall ſpare no Pains, and I flatter myſelf they will have a ſtronger Tendency to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Spleen and Melancholy, than dull Letters from the <hi>Hague,</hi> and fictitious Advices from the <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>Tuck.</hi> By theſe Means I ſhall be able to variegate this Work, and render it a Paper of Entertainment, if not of Inſtruction, and upon all Occaſions I ſhall think it incumbent on me to have ſome Regard to what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Stile. For, notwithſtanding the preſent Practice, it appears to me that ſuch Words ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be choſen as are moſt ſtrongly and elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of the intended Idea; and they ſhould, if I am not miſtaken, be combined in ſuch an Arrangement,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0311400901:16"/>as will not be offenſive to Grammar, or unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon Peruſal. To this if ſome little Knowledge of the World can be added, I conceive it will be an additional Embelliſhment, as from thence may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſome juſt Exhibitions of human Life, and ſome proper Animadverſions on Men and Manners; in which Articles I may venture to affirm the Writers above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned are very deficient, they informing us no one Way of the World, unleſs it be that ſo often inculcated by them, Leading to <hi>Mr. Keith's Chapel, down Clarges-Street, and turn on the Left Hand.</hi>

                  <p>IN order to conduct this Undertaking with the moſt extenſive Variety of Information, Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi> will not depend entirely upon his own Rambles, but has open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Regiſter-Office, where all Articles of News will be given in by proper Emiſſaries, and entered in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Manner by a ſedate Book-keeper, ſo that there will be little more to do than to ſelect from theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories. As there will frequently occur ſhort Hints of Animadverſion, which will not admit an entire Eſſay, I ſhall occaſionally throw out ſome curſory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections dated from this Place, and I have given ſtrict Orders to my ſeveral Agents to keep a vigilant Eye upon all Objects whatever. By theſe Means the Man of Modeſty, ſtealing down the Bye-walk of Life, ſhall bluſh to find his Virtue called into Day-light, and the concealed Hypocrite ſtand in the Pillory of Detection. <hi>Amanda</hi> ſhall not coquet it with every Coxcomb ſhe meets, nor <hi>Lothario</hi> make it his Buſineſs to ruin all female Virtue.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING recommended myſelf, in my laſt <hi>Saturday</hi>'s Paper, to the Patronage of the male Part of my Readers, I ſhall dedicate the preſent Eſſay to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fair; and, as it is principally calculated with a View to their Service, at the ſame Time that it carries with it a collateral Intention of inſinuating myſelf into their Favour, I muſt beg to be admitted this Morning to their Toilets, to call off their Eyes for a little Time from the dearly-beloved Mirrour, to diſcard <hi>Betty</hi> from her Attendance, and, in ſhort, to exclude, for one half Hour, the whole Train of <hi>Dancing-maſters, Manteau-Makers, Stay-Makers, French-Barbers, Venders of Waſhes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I am aware that the Ladies will be alarmed at the Thought of being alone with <hi>Ranger,</hi> but the Reaſon of my deſiring this Diſmiſſion of ſo many Favourites is, becauſe I profeſs the very ſame Art, to which that Claſs of People have always aſpired, that of heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Charms of Female Beauty; and as two of a Trade can never agree, I think it abſolutely neceſſary to meet with no Interruption, in this important Point, from the Pertneſs of a Chambermaid, the Servility of Tradeſmen, and the Shrugs and briſk Interjections of <hi>French</hi> Proficients, who will, no Doubt, be greatly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to hear, that their artificial Embelliſhments, though they may ſerve, when they do not luxuariantly wanton into ſantaſtic Extravagancies, to adorn the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Form, are yet in no Way eſſential; as Beauty, without ſuch Auxiliaries, may be rendered ſtill more attractive in the Eyes of all Men of Senſe.</p>

                     <hi>Horace,</hi> whom it is unneceſſary to introduce to the Acquaintance of the Ladies, as <hi>Creech</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> have taken that agreeable Office upon themſelves, was a Man of the moſt finiſhed Taſte in all Circumſtances of Life; and he tells us, in the Words of my Motto, that he ſhall always love his <hi>Lalage</hi> ſweetly ſmiling, and ſweetly talking; which two Accompliſhments would not have been touched upon by ſo fine a Poet, if they did not carry with them ſome peculiar Charm; and I am inclined to think that in them conſiſts the whole Train of Love's Artillery.</p>
                  <p>Expreſſion has been mentioned by every elegant Writer on this Subject, as the firſt Ingredient in the Compoſition of Beauty; and certainly the more pleaſing the Expreſſion is, the more Energy will be derived from thence upon every Charm. For this Reaſon, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Smile is the beſt Hand-maid to an elegant Set of Features; it give numberleſs Graces to every Delicacy, and diffuſes over the whole Countenance an Emanation of that Sweetneſs of Temper, which is the native Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the Fair. To this Sentiment the witty Dr. <hi>Young</hi> has ſubſcribed in his <hi>Univerſal Paſſion.</hi>

                     <l>They, like the Sun, irradiate all between;</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Body</hi> charms, becauſe the <hi>Soul</hi> is ſeen.</l>

                  <p>This Doctrine has not been eſtabliſhed without the utmoſt Propriety; for ſurely ſenſeleſs, inanimate Matter, however Symmetry, Colour and other Adjuncts, may recommend it, cannot any Way gain upon our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. I have ſeen many a Picture where the Face was well turned, and the Features juſtly diſpoſed, and yet all Men of Judgment have invariably concurred to pronounce the Piece extremely bad, becauſe there were no perceptible Traces of a thinking Power within.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0311400901:21"/>And if this Property is required in the mere Imitation of the human Face, what ſhall be ſaid when it is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in the Original? when the Appearance of a Mind, which alone can diſtinguiſh us from other ſublunary Exiſtences, and which alone can impart real Satisfaction, and excite the ſocial Feelings in an intelligent Being, ſeems to be totally abſent? Miſs <hi>Millefont</hi> is without the niceſt Proportion of Features, and without a gloſſy Bloom of Complexion, and yet I believe no one ever ſaw her ſitting in a Side-Box at a Play, or dancing at an Aſſembly, without feeling Love and Joy in ſprightly Tumult about his Heart. On the other Hand, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa</hi> has a Delicacy of Shape, and Regularity of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and ſtill no one of Taſte will heſitate to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce her unamiable; and I will venture to aſſert, that ſhe is never toaſted but by thoſe, whoſe Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals are ſo poorly ſtocked with Ideas, that they never perceive the Vacuity in others.</p>
                  <p>The ſecret Quality, from which this Difference ariſes, has been called by the <hi>French,</hi> a <hi>Je-ne-ſcay-quoi,</hi> and the Phraſe has been adopted in this Country; but it is ſerving the Purpoſes of good Senſe to explode ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning a Term. For my own Part (with all due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to better Judgments) I declare myſelf of that Sect of Speculatiſts who really believe that Women have Souls, and I am apt to imagine that the Operation of this inward Agent has no ſmall Influence upon the outward Frame. A Poet of Eminence has ſung, "the Paſſions in the Features are," and therefore I ſhould think, that thoſe Ladies, who are ambitious to appear lovely in the Eyes of Men, ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſit to an intellectual Mirrour, in order to ſee their Affections reflected to them; by which Means they would be enabled to adjuſt them, to harmonize them, to keep them in regular Order, and, if I may ſo ſay, make them ſit right. In my Opinion, they ſhould be as aſſiduous to faſhion themſelves in this Point, as to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0311400901:22"/>apply the Patch, to re-eſtabliſh a diſorder'd Lock, to recal a ſtraggling Hair, to ſettle the Tucker, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Mant, ſince taking Care of the Movements of the Mind, is alſo regulating the Features.</p>
                  <p>From this will naturally reſult the next Eſſential to Beauty, the Manner of Talking agreeably, than which Accompliſhment nothing can ſo much enliven the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sex. We are pleaſed to ſee a beautiful Pair of Lips in Motion, when every Thing that comes from them adminiſters to the Pleaſures of Converſation; the Spirits of the Fair are awakened by the Exerciſe of their thinking Faculties, and the Eye beams with double Luſtre; the Tongue confirms, what the Countenance had before indicated, that all within is ſprightly, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, gay, ſpirited, and ſenſible. The Scene is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhifted to our Imagination; we are delighted to obſerve the Celerity, which diſtinguiſhes itſelf in the Operations of the Female Underſtanding, and the quick Succeſſion of Ideas, which they call up, amuſes with pleaſing Variety, while the Beauties of the Mind and Face mutually exalt each other, and we ſtand convinced of the <hi>Platonic</hi> Tenet, that <hi>good</hi> and <hi>beautiful</hi> are the ſame.</p>
                  <p>There are three Things highly pernicious to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments of Beauty, from which I muſt abſolutely interdict thoſe, who are willing to become my Pupils. The Enemies to Lovelineſs, which I mean, are GAMING, SCANDAL, and POLITICS, ſurer Deſtroyers of every Elegance and Bloom, than a Spotted Fever or the Small-Pox; as chronical Diſeaſes are more fatal to the Conſtitution, than a tranſitory Fit of an acute Illneſs.</p>
                  <p>With Regard to the firſt of theſe Corroſives, I leave it to the fair Votaries of Fortune to conſider how the winning Graces and the attractive Smile can irradiate the Countenance, when the Internal is diſturbed by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0311400901:23"/>Anxiety and Solicitude, which ſoon tranſpire into the Face, and prey upon all their Charms. Beſides, when the Temper is diſconcerted, Politeneſs and Good-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are in Danger of being neglected; and while every one is intent upon the After-game, which is the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Term for that Claſh of Tongues, frequently heard in one loud Din, as ſoon as the Deal at <hi>Whiſt</hi> is out, it is not probable that the Fair can converſe in a Manner ſuitable to the Softneſs and Elegance of their Sex.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scandal</hi> always carries with it a dreadful Efficacy to ruin a delicate Face, becauſe it generally ſprings from Envy or Malice, which are both entirely againſt my Rules for acquiring and preſerving Beauty, as they are inveterate Habits, the Traces of which are apt to wear themſelves into the Complexion, inducing Frowns, Wrinkles, Roughneſs, and a ſettled Appearance of Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature, of all Things the moſt unamiable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Politics</hi> is alſo of pernicious Influence, tending to inflame the Ladies with Party-Rage, to cauſe Heats in the Face, and to occaſion thoſe Vibrations of the Fan, Bitings of the Lips, and Fidgets on the Chair, which greatly diſcompoſe the whole Form. On this Account I would have my fair Readers abſtain from Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Debates. And, tho' the intended <hi>Naturalization-Act</hi> has engroſſed the Thoughts of the whole Nation, I think it enough for the Ladies to have ſecretly reſolved not to marry a <hi>Jew;</hi> and without engaging too deeply in the Controverſy, the ſparkling Croſſes, which they wear upon their lovely Boſoms, will be a ſufficient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of their Principles, and will at once reflect a Luſtre upon the Whiteneſs of their Skins, and the Delicacy of their Sentiments.</p>
                  <p>In what has been premiſed, I would have it remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that I do not mean to recommend a ſtudied Simper, or a reſtleſs Exertion of Chit-Chat, but I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0311400901:24"/>would have both to be a natural Effuſion, from the Sources of Good-nature and Good-ſenſe, which, I am convinced, will be found a better beautifying Cream, than any Coſmetic advertiſed in our News-Papers; and therefore inſtead of lying-in for a new Face, or uſing any other Artifice, my Precept to the Ladies, is, BE GOOD-HUMOURED FOR A COMPLEXION; and I now give Notice, that I ſhall carefully obſerve, in all public Places, what Ladies repair a decayed Viſage, or add new Graces to a blooming one, by this Receipt, and that I ſhall inſert an exact Liſt of the ſame in the Articles of News, which I ſhall ſerve up weekly to regale my Cuſtomers.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Papers which I have hitherto publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were chiefly intended to open a Way for the better Execution of this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, as Pioneers are diſpatched to clear the Country for the main Body of an Army; and in the ſame Light I beg that the preſent Lucubration may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0311400901:26"/>be conſidered. I find, ſince the Commencement of the <hi>Gray's-Inn Journal,</hi> that I have been the Subject of much Converſation in this Metropolis: The Critics, it ſeems, are buſy in their Enquiries after the Author. Does any body know him? — Has he been long upon Town? — Has he any Thing in him? — What Sort of a Man is he? — Theſe and many other Queſtions of the ſame Nature are the Topics at preſent; and tho' at firſt ſetting out I thought to evade an Account of myſelf, having had always a ſtrong Antipathy to any Thing that might border upon the ridiculous Character of an Egotiſt; yet ſuch is the Prevalence of Cuſtom, that it is now become a Tribute due from every Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer in this Way, and therefore I ſhall wave the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions I have taken, and will at preſent gratify the Reader's Curioſity.</p>
                  <p>I am of the ſprightly Family of the <hi>Rangers,</hi> who have made a diſtinguiſhed Figure, in this Country, ever ſince the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II. and am a near Relation to my Nameſake in the Play, whom many of my Readers have often admired when perſonated by Mr. <hi>Garrick.</hi> Though I do not at preſent aſcend by Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Ropes into honeſt Men's Houſes, yet, under a few Reſtrictions, I ſtill bear ſome ſimilar Habits of his Humour. My Education was at <hi>Eton,</hi> where I imbibed my firſt Tincture of Letters; though, to tell the Truth, I was chiefly remarkable, at that Place, for running out of Bounds. I ſcarcely paſſed over a Week without paying a Viſit to <hi>Windſor.</hi> I was delighted in the Caſtle with the bold Imagery which the Touch of <hi>Verrio</hi>'s Pencil has poured fourth to the Eye, and to ſee the Canvas every where glowing with mimic Life was pleaſing to my young Imagination.</p>
                  <p>At length, with the Character of a wild Lad that had <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> enough, I was removed to the Univerſity, where I maintained the ſame Reputation for five Years. Whatever was the Reaſon of it, I never could adopt any Party-Principles, and thoſe whom I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0311400901:27"/>attached to Prejudices of either Side have always appeared to me in very ludicrous Colours. I have known a <hi>Jacobite</hi> drink himſelf out of his Health and Fortune for the Good of his Country, and I have ſeen a very worthy Gentleman reduced to Neceſſity by ſquandering his Subſtance in Elections, to keep out the Pope, the Devil, and the <hi>French</hi> King. I believe there cannot be a more ridiculous Character than that of a <hi>State Quixote,</hi> who having Affairs of Moment to himſelf and his Family, generouſly neglects his own Concerns to take Care of his Country, which would be in every Particular as well without ſuch a Patriot.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I have no Manner of Taſte for Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; the Election of the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> does not concern me, nor do I trouble myſelf about the Window<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light Tax, provided the Prices at the Play-Houſe are not raiſed upon us; and as to a ſtanding Army, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Red-coats ſhall give me no kind of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, while they plant no Bruiſers in the Pit to over-rule our Deciſions. Should any ſuch Attempts be made upon the Birth-right Privileges of an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> I ſhall then be as warm a Patriot as the beſt of them. Not even the Freedom of both Houſes ſhall buy me off; and I have now lying by me ſeveral Eſſays on Hiſtory, and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Form of Government, which in that Caſe ſhall ſee the Light.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Principles I have contracted with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Matters of State; as to my Perſon, I beg Leave to be ſilent on that Head, as I do not chuſe to receive any Propoſals for Marriage, which I am told have been publickly ſolicited by a certain daily Writer. Thus much I will hint, I am now in the two and thirtieth Year of my Age, and, after having taken the Tour of <hi>Europe, Gray</hi>'s <hi>Inn</hi> is become, in <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Language, <hi>the Sea-mark of my utmoſt Sail.</hi> I have been regiſtered according to the Police in <hi>Paris,</hi> and, like Sir <hi>Harry Wildair</hi> in the Play, have play'd at Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cockles
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0311400901:28"/>with an whole Convent of Nuns in <hi>Italy:</hi> In ſhort, I have gone through all the Variety of Manners and Diverſions in each different Country, and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your Beau up to the Ears in Ink. I look upon the Gardens belonging to this Society to be the Seat of the Muſes: Here the great <hi>Bacon</hi> paſſed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Hours; and here, at an humble Diſtance, the preſent Writer purpoſes to follow his Steps.</p>

                  <p>The Day I do not take a Turn in the poetic Ground juſt mention'd, I feel the moſt aukward Senſations, and fancy to myſelf that I breathe with Difficulty. This I muſt own is an Oddity in my Temper, but Habit has now confirmed it. However, I ſhall make it ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the Deſign of this Paper, as it will afford me an Opportunity of collecting Materials for theſe Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubrations; and, among the Number that frequent this Place, I ſhall be able ſometimes to glean a few Characters for the Amuſement of my Readers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, I belong to a Club of <hi>Originals,</hi> which meets, once in each Month, at the <hi>Devil-Tavern,</hi> near <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Bar.</hi> Every Member of it is remarkable for ſome Peculiarity in his Manners and Way of thinking, and this not contracted by an affected Imitation of others, but abſolutely inherent and native to the reſpective Perſons. I ſhall take a proper Opportunity to bring the Town acquainted with this Society, and perhaps may deduce from their Aſſiſtance ſuch Matter, as will not be diſagreeable to my Reader.</p>
                  <p>I muſt add to what has been ſaid, that I have from Nature a very extraordinary Talent, which, as it will be of Uſe hereafter, I will here explain. I have been remarkable from my Infancy for a moſt ſurprizing Skill in Phyſiognomy, and have had, from my greener Years, the ſharpeſt Diſcernment into the Paſſions of Men from the Survey of their Countenances. This
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0311400901:29"/>Faculty has grown up with me, and it is now arrived to that Degree of Penetration, that I can, by infallible Rules, read the Thoughts of People. When a Critic talks of <hi>Longinus,</hi> I can often perceive, by the Caſt of his Eye, that he never looked into him; and in all Deciſions upon Stile, Language, and Authors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I can diſcover, with a Glance, the ſecret Springs of Action and the latent Prejudices lurking in their Minds. Of this more another Time. As to the News, I ſhall receive frequent Contributions from a particular Friend, who is every Way qualified for that Branch. His Name is <hi>Harry Wildair,</hi> and I am confident he will conduce a good deal to enliven this Paper.</p>
                  <p>Having thus far explained myſelf, I will conclude with a few Reſolutions which I have taken for the better conducting this our <hi>Gray's Inn Journal.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That the Mottos to be prefixed to the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays ſhall not be taken at random out of the <hi>Gradus ad Parnaſſum,</hi> but that they be ſelected from ſome good Author, without bad <hi>Latin,</hi> falſe Quantity, and bearing ſome Reference to the Point in Hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That no indecent Liberties be taken with the Character of any Gentleman or Lady.</p>

I do not think this Phaenomenon in the ideal World is at any Time ſo ſurprizing, as in thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when the Faculties of bodily Senſation are lulled in Sleep; then the Imagination calls forth her abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0311400901:32"/>Train, and, being free from the Incumbrance of Fleſh, diſports herſelf in the moſt whimſical Manner, and is at Liberty to form what Appearances, what Scenery, what Imagery, and what Reaſoning ſhe thinks proper. This I experienced in a lively Manner the other Night, and as I cannot help believing that any of my Readers would have been glad to enjoy the ſame viſionary Scene, I ſhall, inſtead of a formal Eſſay, make my Dream the Subject of this Day's Paper.</p>
                  <p>I retired home to my Chambers a few Evenings ſince, in a very poetical Mood, and, to gratify the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Courſe of my Ideas, took into my Hand <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Georgies,</hi> which has always been conſidered by the Critics, as the moſt perfect Poem, of the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed Poet The Delicacy of Expreſſion, and every refined Beauty in the Turn of the Stile, have been finely treated by the elegant Mr. <hi>Addiſon;</hi> and, for my Part, I never look into it, but I perceive ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed Stroke, which had before eſcaped me. But the Enthuſiaſm which animates the following Paſſage, ſtruck me the other Night in a Manner which never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me before.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Me quoque Parnaſſi deſerta per ardua dulcis</l>
                     <l>Paptat amor; juvat ire jugis, quâ nulla priorum</l>
                     <l>Caſtaliam molli divertitur orbita clivo.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Fire and Rapidity in the firſt Line, and the Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Air of Inſpiration in the ſucceeding one, muſt warm any Imagination, that has but the leaſt Spark of Fire. I could not help dwelling on it with Admiration; it opened to my Mind a Train of Images which gave me the moſt exquiſite Pleaſure, and made ſuch an Impreſſion on my Spirits, that even in Sleep they continued to flow in the ſame Traces, they had before been thrown into, and thus my waking Thoughts were recalled to me with double Delight.</p>
                  <p>I thought that of a ſudden I was hurried away to the Realms of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> and that I towered with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0311400901:33"/>Rapture over the ſeveral Cliffs, which are frequent in thoſe Regions. The Air, methought, ſeemed to be clearer than what I have ever met with; the Skies were brightened into the pureſt Azure; the Sun darted his genial Rays all around, and different Streaks of Light blending themſelves in ſundry Parts of the Hemiſphere ſerved to diverſiſy the Scene; the Country ſmiled in vernal Delight, covered with the moſt chearful Green I had ever beheld. In one Part was diſplayed to View an ample Lawn, ſtretched to ſuch a Length, that the Eye loſt itſelf; on the other Side preſented themſelves Meads and Gardens, and Laurel Groves. Hills there were, whoſe blue Tops grew fine by Degrees, and leſſened to the Sight amid the Clouds. From one of theſe iſſued the <hi>Pierian</hi> Fountain, which, divided into ſeveral Rills, came tinkling down the Mountain, and at the Bottom all aſſembling into one general Reſervoir, they there expanded themſelves into a pleaſing Surface, and formed a River, which watered all the Country round. Here I fell into that State of Mind, which is ſo excellently deſcribed in the <hi>Pleaſures of Imagination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Then the inexpreſſive Strain</l>
                     <l>Diffuſes its Enchantment; Fancy dreams</l>
                     <l>Of ſacred Fountains, and <hi>Elyſian</hi> Groves,</l>
                     <l>And Vales of Bliſs; the Intellectual Pow'r</l>
                     <l>Bends from his awful Throne a liſt' ning Ear,</l>
                     <l>And ſmiles; the Paſſions gently ſooth'd away</l>
                     <l>Sink to divine Repoſe, and Love and Joy</l>
                     <l>Alone are waking; Love and Joy ſerene</l>
                     <l>As Airs that fan the Summer.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>I felt the moſt ardent Ambition to gain the Summit of the Hill, but it was in ſeveral Places ſo ſleep, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhould never have reached it, if <hi>Apollo</hi> had not been favourable to the humble Prayer which I prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I did not build my Supplication upon any Merit in the literary World, but humbly preſumed upon the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0311400901:34"/>Delight which I always took in Works of Genius; and in <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Eye, the next Thing to a good Author is to have a Taſte and Reliſh for the Beauties of fine Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. I was ſtruck with reverential Awe at the Sight of the God of Wit; and ſuch Melody filled my Ears, ſuch divine Harmony enchanted the Place, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fell on my Knees, and worſhipped the nine har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Maids, who cauſed the heavenly Strain. They beheld each other with an Air of mutual Affection and Complacence; their Eyes were bright with Meaning, and I thought that, in Delicacy of Shape and Feature, they had a near Reſemblance to two Ladies known to the World by the Name of the HIBERNIAN BEAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIES.</p>
                  <p>After paying ſufficient Adoration, I withdrew from the Preſence of the Deities, and went round the Place, in order to view the Country more particularly. The greateſt Part of theſe Regions is portioned out by <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> into different Tenures, ſome of them conveyed to the Perſon for ever, others for Life, and many for a ſhorter Duration. There are Manſion-houſes built on many of theſe Eſtates, and the great Genius's, who have made a Figure in the World, have here fixed their Reſidence.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients ſeemed to have by much the largeſt Poſſeſſions, though a great Part of their Property was transferred to the Moderns. <hi>Dryden,</hi> beſides his own hereditary Eſtate, had purchaſed a large Scope of Ground from the celebrated <hi>Virgil,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has bought near half of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Rent-Roll. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> ſpent moſt of his Time in writing Prefaces and Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the great Men of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> was retired to his own Houſe, which was ſituated on the Banks of the River already mentioned, and the Country adjacent was laid out in the moſt exquiſite Taſte. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> was formerly very attentive to the Improvement
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0311400901:35"/>of his Land, and where the Soil did not yield ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly, he aſſiſted with Hot-beds. This Turn was now quite over with him, and his chief Care was to embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a Temple of Virtue and Happineſs, which he had raiſed in the Middle of his Garden.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>There his Retreat the beſt Companions grace,</l>
                     <l>Chiefs out of War, and Stateſmen out of Place.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>In Company with theſe celebrated Perſonages he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his own Eaſe and Dignity; and though his Soul glowed within him, when ſitting with <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> and <hi>Marchmont,</hi> he ſeemed to receive a more near Delight from his <hi>Gay</hi> and <hi>Parnell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> fat upon a Cliff, looking abroad through all Creation. His Poſſeſſions were very near as extenſive as <hi>Homer</hi>'s, but, in ſome Places, had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſufficient Culture. But even there ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Flowers ſhot up, and in the <hi>unweeded Garden, which grows to Seed,</hi> you might cull Lavender, Myrtle, and Wild Thyme. Craggy Rocks, Hills, and Dales, the Woodland and open Country, ſtruck the Eye with wild Variety, and o'er our Heads roll'd Thunder, deep and awful, and the Lightning's Flaſh darted athwart the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Scene, while on the blaſted Heath, Witches, Elves, and Fairies, with their own <hi>Queen Mab,</hi> play'd in frolic Gambols. Mean time the immortal Bard ſat with his <hi>Eyes in a fine Phrenzy rolling,</hi> and Writers both in the Tragic and Comic Stile were gathered round him. <hi>Ariſctle</hi> ſeemed to lament that <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> had not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died his. Art of Poetry, and <hi>Longirus</hi> admired him to a Degree of Enthuſiaſm. <hi>Otway, Rowe,</hi> and <hi>Congreve</hi> had him conſtantly in their Eye, and even <hi>Milton</hi> was looking for Flowers to tranſplant into his own Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>I was called off from ſurveying the Poſſeſſions of the immertal <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> by repeated Peals of Laughter,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0311400901:36"/>which reſounded from an adjacent Grove. This, I ſoon perceived, was occaſioned by the irreſiſtible Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Lucian, Cervantes,</hi> and <hi>Swift,</hi> while, at ſome Diſtance from them, <hi>Rabelais</hi> threw himſelf into a thouſand antick Attitudes, and brought together the moſt ludicrous Aſſemblage of Ideas, with all the ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Frolick of his wild Imagination.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Richard Steel</hi> fixed his Reſidence under Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s Roof, where <hi>Tickell</hi> was encouraged to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate a Book of <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Phillips</hi> was aſſiſted in finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Diſtreſſed Mother. Addiſon</hi> had before him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the periodical Eſſays, which have lately been ſent abroad into the World, among which, methought, I ſaw a Paper entitled the <hi>Gray's-Inn Journal,</hi> when *********************.</p>
                  <p>The Effect this had upon me was ſuch, that my Viſion was immediately diſſipated, and I awaked in the moſt pleaſing Serenity of Mind.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> FIND myſelf obliged to poſtpone the Eſſay I intended for this Day, by an Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſuch a Nature, that I think it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably incumbent on me to take ſome Notice of it. I did not imagine, before this Incident, that a cold, trifling, frothy Writer, could have drawn ſo much from me; but in the Defence of Truth, Juſtice, and good Senſe, I cannot controul myſelf from it; and as he has thought proper to record a Fact, I will in my Turn begin with one of as glaring a Die as I have ever known.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Preſents then be it known unto Poſterity, that in the Year One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Fifty-two, there really did exiſt a daily Author, who arrogated to himſelf the Title of <hi>Inſpector General</hi> of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> that under this pompous Appellation he took upon him to preſcribe Faſhions to the Ladies, and Wire-Wigs to the Gentlemen; Intrigue to Rakes, and Taſte to pretty Fellows; that he peſter'd the Town with Diſſertations on Foſſils, Minerals, and Inſects, that never exiſted but in his own Imagination, and from thence (emboldened by a kind of negative Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, that of being endured) he roſe a Degree higher, and at a Time when our theatrical Entertainments were
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0311400901:39"/>under the juſteſt Regulation, did his Endeavours to ſow the Seeds of Diſcontent in the Minds of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to ſoment Diviſions among them, and, contrary to all Law, to raiſe a Riot at the Theatre-Royal in <hi>Deary Lane,</hi> and in a public Paper abſurdly encouraged them to throw the Sconces and Benches on the Stage.</p>
                  <p>It is hard to imagine to one's ſelf the Ideas that will occur to Posterity upon Peruſal of this moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Paſſage: they will, I am afraid, believe their Anceſtors, at this Period relapſing into the antient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Authors of the immortal Performances juſt mentioned endeavoured to cheriſh Good-humour, Good-nature, Social Harmony, and Good-manners. Theatrical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in their Time was promoted to the greateſt Elegance; every Thing that carried with it the leaſt Tincture of a vitiated Taſte was by them attacked with the moſt maſterly Strokes; and now this Eſſayiſt would turn the Tables upon theſe approved Geniuſes, and, by extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing all Sparks of Emulation, deſtroy the only Means of heightening our public Entertainments, and diſaboliſhing Senſe and Refinement among us</p>
                  <p>As I generally like to trace Things to their Source, I have been conſidering what could be the Motives that induced his <hi>Inſpectorſhip</hi> to this Proceeding, and I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> I may take upon me to ſay I have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the latent Cauſe. This Prodigy of Genius, this florid, witty, elegant, ſenſible, unexhauſted <hi>Inſpector,</hi> owed the firſt Dawnings of his immoderate Fame (I

                     </q> Shall he look tamely on, and ſee his favourite Monſters expoſed to Ridicule? May he not have ſome wild Production ſtill in Store? Such a Genius never can have done, and hence all that laboured Impotence of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion which he has thrown out in two different Papers.</p>
                  <p>But to be a little more ſerious. It is certain, that two contending Theatres have always indulged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Strokes of Pleaſantry upon each other; the <hi>Impromptu</hi> of <hi>Moliere</hi> was a Banter upon a rival Houſe in ſo polite a Place as <hi>Paris,</hi> and a recent Inſtance will evince, that Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> has no Averſion to the Practice: It is notorious that a few Winters ſince he engaged a Perſon whoſe Abilities conſiſt ſolely in Mimickry, publicly to burleſque, as far as in him lay, Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> as a Man, an Actor, and a Manager. He has always given oblique Alluſions whenever they came in his Way, and nothing has eſcaped him from the Coronation in <hi>Harry</hi> the Fourth, down to the Ballad in <hi>Harlequin Ranger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſhall not the Manager of the other Houſe have leave to amuſe the Town in his Turn? It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the Writer who has occaſioned my taking the Pen in Hand, that <hi>the Objects are well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; there is Humour in the Management of them, and there is Merit in the Song that explains the Deſign of their Introduction; what is more, there is Juſtice, for the Subject
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0311400901:41"/>is worthy Ridicule.</hi> In ſaying this he advances nothing but the Truth, but when he adds, <hi>Where is the Modeſty of arraigning the Taſte of an Audience, to an Audience,</hi> &amp;c. and again, <hi>It is unjuſtifiable, it is cruel, it is not to be ſupperted:</hi> In the Name of Common Senſe, what wou'd he be at? Firſt, there is Merit in it, then it is not to be juſtified; there is Humour in it, then it is not to be ſupported; there is Juſtice in it, and the next Moment it is cruel. For Heaven's ſake, Mr. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector,</hi> learn to be a little conſiſtent, and don't thus trifle with our Underſtandings.</p>
                  <p>When a Man will write in this ſhuffling Manner, blowing hot and cold, ſaying and unſaying; when an Author, who pretends to inſtruct, will run off from the Point, in a ſnip-ſnap Stile, with pert Queſtion and Anſwer, down a whole Column of his Paper, it is not eligible to follow him further; therefore let his meandering Briſkneſs run what Riots it will for the future, I ſhall here ſtate this Matter in a proper Light, and then have done with Controverſy.</p>
                  <p>Nothing, in my Apprehenſion, ſhews the Temper of this Nation, more than the Ferment their Minds are thrown into by little Diviſions of this Nature. A real, or a mock Monarch, a Miniſter of State, or a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager of a Theatre, muſt eternally embarraſs their Thoughts. Every Thing among them muſt be a Party-buſineſs; whereas, in my Opinion, while their Liberties remain inviolate, they ſhould know no Party, but a Party of Pleaſure, and all Differences betwixt <hi>Tweedle-Dum</hi> and <hi>Tweedle-Dee</hi> ſhould be ſubſervient to their Merriment. The Field of Humour is open to both Play-Houſes, and if, without Animoſity, they will cull from thence, the Reſult muſt be, that the Public will receive more Entertainment from a ſpirited Emulation than from an inactive State. This is the Caſe among the <hi>French</hi> to this Day, and thoſe who
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0311400901:42"/>weep one Night at a Tragedy of Genius, are ſure to laugh at the ſame Piece, the Evening following, at the <hi>Italian</hi> Comedy. And if this Liberty is taken with the nobleſt Productions of the human Mind, why ſo much Tenderneſs for what is really ridiculous and unfit for the Stage? The <hi>Dramatis Perſonae</hi> expoſed to Deriſion, on this Occaſion, are, if I am not miſtaken, a <hi>Lyon,</hi> a <hi>Bear,</hi> a <hi>Cat,</hi> a <hi>Dog,</hi> a <hi>Monkey,</hi> a <hi>Serpent,</hi> and an <hi>Oſtrich;</hi> an admirable Company of Comedians truly! but are they ſuch reſpectable Perſonages, as to claim an Exemption from the Laſh of Ridicule?—Ay, but <hi>Poor Rich! Poor Rich!</hi> — If by that pathetic Exclamation is meant that he is an Object of Compaſſion, I own I have always thought him ſuch, and do from my Heart moſt ſincerely pity him. But if, through a Depravity of Taſte, or Debility of Mind, he has no Reliſh for the ſublimer Compoſitions of a Theatre, let not us therefore, like <hi>Egyptians,</hi> worſhip Serpents, Dogs, and Monkeys; but, on the contrary, let us by the Aſſiſtance of the politer Arts efface all Traces of Barbariſm, and preſerve in all our public Exhibitions, a manly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for the Cauſe of Dramatic Poeſy, of Genius, and of <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N a former Paper, in which I gave ſome Account of myſelf, I was not in jeſt when I told my Readers, that from a natural Sagacity of Sight, improved by Experience and Study. I had made a ſurpriſing Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in the Art of Phyſiognomy. Among my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Acquaintance I have acquired ſuch a Reputation in this Way, that I have known many Ladies, who would no more dare to come into my Company, than the young Romp, in <hi>Swift</hi>'s Viſion, would venture to ſtroke the Pariſh Lion, after ſhe had play'd at Hide and Hoop with <hi>Jackey</hi> in the Garret. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, I am ſenſible, the Majority of Mankind at this Day treat this Art as a mere exploded Impoſture, like Aſtrology and Palmiſtry, impoſed upon the Credulous in dark and ignorant Ages. With them a Phyſiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt and a Conjurer meet with the ſame Degree of Reſpect and Credit. But this Objection, I believe, will quickly vaniſh, when we come to conſider the Principles and Foundation on which the Art is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. I might here aptly bring in the Story of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> and the Phyſiognomiſt, but it is known to every Body; beſides, Reaſon alone, and not Authority, is what I proceed upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0311400901:46"/>The great and almoſt incredible Wonder of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, conſiſts in being able to diſcover the Paſſions, Virtues and Affections, even at the very Time that they are dormant in the Breaſt; ſo as to point out a knaviſh Citizen at his Prayers; to know a Cut-throat, tho' he ſmiles; or a Fellow that has a Deſign upon your Fob, though he turns his Head another Way with an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Vacancy of Face; to mark out a Fellow whoſe Mouth is open only to have it ſtop'd with a Bribe while he is declaiming againſt Corruption; or to detect the Niggard Hand of a Miſer in the very Act of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generoſity and Munificence. Yet all this and more may be done; and how it may be done, I will here in part explain; but I muſt beg to be excuſed, if I do not reveal ſome Secrets of this <hi>Arcanum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every Paſſion, every Virtue, and their ſeveral Modes, Mixtures and Combinations, which ſubſiſt in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Breaſt, have a correſpondent Set of Muſcles in the Face, or (if the Anatomiſts will not allow this) they at leaſt operate differently upon the ſame Set of Muſcles, which, when any Affection is Maſter of the Temper, are thrown into Motion, and this regularly produces a certain Configuration of Features, which is commonly known to us by the Name of <hi>Expreſſion.</hi> This the Painters and the Statuaries can alſo atteſt, and to this they owe the very Soul of their Art; for by obſerving the exact Shape that each different Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Mind gives the ſeveral Muſcles of the Face, and by copying the ſame upon a lifeleſs Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it produces that agreeable Deception, which makes us imagine that this Diſpoſition of Features is an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Motion, communicated from a thinking Mind within, when it is only the Reſult of their Skill in the Art of Imitation. The good Player goes another Way to work; he excites in himſelf the inward Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0311400901:47"/>which we call feeling, and then the outward Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the Countenance naturally follows.</p>
                  <p>The Anatomiſts will further inform us, that every Muſcle of the human Body collects Strength, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands itſelf into larger Dimenſions, by continual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Uſe; as the Legs of Chairmen and others who are uſed to carry Burthens, from the ſame Cauſe, ſwell to an uncommon Thickneſs. It follows then, that the correſpondent Muſcles of the Face, which expreſs any ruling Paſſion of the Mind, being more frequently exerted, grow out of Proportion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come conſpicuous above the reſt. Hence the Face con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts an habitual Air, marking the Features with ſome peculiar Caſt of Character, which is legible at one Glance of the Eye. Any Body can diſtinguiſh a Miſer, a Coxcomb, a Leacher, or a Glutton, in every Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of Life.</p>
                  <p>I know ſome well-meaning People may be ſhocked at the Thoughts of indulging ourſelves in the Practice of forming Opinions of Mankind by their Looks. This proceeds from a charitable Conſideration, that as we make not our own Faces, we ſhould not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for them; but they who think in this Way take no Care to diſtinguiſh the <hi>good Face,</hi> the <hi>ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Vultus</hi> of the Ancients, that which <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays is the beſt Letter of Recommendation a Man can carry about him, from the <hi>Handſome,</hi> the mere Formation of inactive Features, and Gloſs of Complexion. The latter is the Gift of Nature alone, and is that which the Philoſophers of all Ages have perſuaded us is of no intrinſic Value; but the former, which we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand when we ſay, ſuch a Face is not handſome, but is extremely <hi>agreeable,</hi> is in every Man's Power to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; not by ſtudying to put on a formal Simper, or ſmiling Complacency, before the Glaſs, but by recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0311400901:48"/>the Mind, and furniſhing it with noble, generous, and virtuous Sentiments, which transfuſe themſelves into our Features, with an irreſiſtible Perſuaſion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding by a ſecret Kind of Faſcination, the Eſteem of every judicious Beholder. I never knew a ſtronger Inſtance of this than in the Face of a certain Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, to a vulgar Eye, might appear to have an unpleaſing Aſſemblage of Diſproportion and Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved a certain Attorney in <hi>Weſtminſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> who, I think, has one of the <hi>handſomeſt</hi> Faces I ever ſaw; and yet, through the Luſtre of his Eye, the Regularity of his Features, and Bloom of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, I could read ſuch a ſettled Habit of the moſt contracted Cunning, ſo many determined Purpoſes of Cozenage and Fraud, that I proteſt I could not be eaſy while the Fellow ſtood within Arms-length of my Pockets. Yet, to my Aſtoniſhment, upon Inquiry, I learned that ſeveral great Families had intruſted this Man with their moſt important Affairs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eugenio</hi> is neither happy in a Face nor a Perſon; and, at the Time he ſhould have learned to dance, was unfortunately employed in forming his Mind upon the Model of the Ancients. Hence he has contracted an uncouth Air, a College Look, and an aukward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; yet, through all theſe Diſadvantages, and a Cloud of uneaſy Circumſtances, the judicious Eye can diſcover a Soul within capable of diſplaying the moſt <hi>divine Attributes of his God,</hi> with a Sublimity inferior to nothing but the Subject.</p>
                  <p>On the other Hand, caſt your Eye upon <hi>Florio. Florio</hi> is a Man of Gaiety and plauſible Addreſs. And there are ſome whom he hath perſuaded to think him one of the prettieſt Writers of the preſent Age. By his Dexterity in the Art of Plagiariſm, he paſſes upon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0311400901:49"/>the Crowd for a Man of ſome Learning; and I have heard himſelf ſay, that the Ladies think him a Man of Gallantry, and a Wit. No Man is more perfectly ſatisfied with himſelf than <hi>Florio;</hi> he writes with the utmoſt Facility, without any Manner of Subject, and this he thinks is Stile, Simplicity, and Eaſe. Upon the whole, one might be ſo far deceived at firſt Sight, as to think <hi>Florio</hi> a pretty Fellow. Yet look at his Countenance, can any Thing be more viſible than the Furniture within? a confuſed Aſſemblage of Vanity, Arrogance, Cowardice, Dulneſs, Ignorance, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. <hi>Florio</hi> generally wears a Gleam of Chearfulneſs on his Face, and yet it is viſible that this is all forced, and, thro' the falſe Appearance, <hi>Florio</hi> has an uneaſy diſconcerted Temper.</p>
                  <p>The Mortification in <hi>Sordido</hi>'s Leg had like to have gone too far, before he could prevail upon himſelf to be at the Expence of cutting it off. I attended him at the Time of the Operation, which, to the Surprize of every one, he bore with wonderful Patience; but while others were admiring his amazing Reſolution, I could plainly perceive by his Looks, that <hi>Sordido</hi>'s Compoſure proceeded from the conſoling Thoughts, that he ſhould hereafter ſave juſt half his Expences, in the Article of Shoes.</p>
                  <p>I could point out a certain Reverend Gentleman, who wears the moſt plauſible Appearance of Humility, Sanctity, and Grace. Ask him familiarly how he does? and with a ſolemn, thankſgiving Voice, and the Whites of his Eyes turned up with pious Gratitude to Heaven, he bleſſes his God he is very well. Yet view his ſhining, jolly Countenance with the ſmalleſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Attention, and through this Gauze of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, you plainly diſcover a horrid Groupe behind, compoſed of Pride, Gluttony, Cruelty, and Luſt.—
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0311400901:50"/>Yet I'll engage, he'll riſe in his Profeſſion, for he can cringe and flatter with the beſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prudiſſa</hi> is regular at her Devotions; ſhe goes twice a Day to Church; ſhe conſtantly has her Footman to carry her Prayer-book; yet I could obſerve at a Viſit the other Day, that in ſome of her Walks, there had been more Familiarity between her and this ſame Footman, who then handed the Tea-Equipage, than was altogether conſonant to the Character ſhe chuſes to aſſume.</p>
                  <p>The unhappy <hi>Caliſta,</hi> through the Perſidy of the Man ſhe once placed her Affections upon, and ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Misfortunes that followed after, is now obliged to <hi>endure</hi> the Embraces of one of the moſt deteſtable Leachers upon Earth; yet in <hi>Caliſta</hi>'s Soul, I can read the latent Traces of Chaſtity, Humility, and Love, blended with a Tenderneſs of Diſtreſs, that ſometimes flows into her Eyes, and adds ſuch a melting Softneſs to her native Beauty, as nothing that is human can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void being affected with. Yet to a vulgar Eye, the unfortunate <hi>Caliſta</hi> appears no better than the common Tribe of Proſtitutes.</p>
                  <p>Not to produce any further Inſtances at preſent, I can ſee ſo clearly into the Characters and Diſpoſitions of Mankind, that if ſome Folks, whoſe Names I could mention, do not ſhortly mend their Manners, I will take a general Tour through the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and unmask every ſmooth-faced Villain that I meet. In the mean Time, if a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who generally wears a laced Frock, a Bag-wig, and a long Sword, does not lay aſide his Project of ſacrificing to a Set of Sharpers, with whom he is to go Shares, the good natured young Nobleman, who took a Liking to him for his Honeſty, I will certainly let his Lordſhip know the whole Affair. And if a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0311400901:51"/>Lady of Diſtinction, who, by a Side Glance laſt <hi>Monday</hi> in the <hi>Mall,</hi> diſcovered what intimate Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities had paſſed the Evening before, between her and a certain handſome Fellow in a red Coat, does not inſtantly break off all further Commerce with him, I muſt immediately inform her Husband; for I cannot any longer bear to ſee a Man of Conſequence and Senſe hurt in his Honour by ſo conſummate a Coxcomb; but further, I muſt inform the unfortunate Lady, that from a certain Symptom in her Paramour's Face, I can plainly foreſee, he intends to make himſelf much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier this Night, than ever he was in her Embraces, among half a Dozen of his Companions, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of her Reputation and Honour.</p>

                  <p>This Way of deſiring a Man's <hi>Company,</hi> where he is not to ſpeak five Words, has in it ſomething extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; and though I am not fond of faſhionable Vices, yet I could never prevail on myſelf to renounce
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0311400901:53"/>a Thing ſo eſſential in the polite World, as <hi>Card-play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is at preſent; and therefore I returned for Anſwer, that I ſhould do myſelf the Pleaſure of waiting upon her Ladyſhip. It is not enough at preſent for a Man to know the World, to ſee into the Humours of different Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to diſcover a lively Vein of Thinking upon all Topics that may offer in Converſation; unleſs he has learned to loſe his Money gracefully, theſe Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments go for nothing, and wherever he viſits, he is reckoned <hi>nothing but Lumber.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mellefont</hi> never wants Wit, and has many amiable Qualities, but not being a Card player, whenever he enters a Room, the Lady of the Houſe is ſure to receive him, without ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of the indolent Poſture in which ſhe had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed herſelf. "Mr. <hi>Mellefont,</hi>" ſays ſhe, with her Eyes ſwimming between Sleep and Wake round the Room, "pray ſit down, Sir.—one is ſo—I don't know how—this Weather."—But let Mr. <hi>Hazard</hi> with his Midnight Face make his Appearance; her Heart dances at the Sight of him, the Bell rings for the Card-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Houſe is in an Uproar in an Inſtant.</p>
                  <p>That I may not paſs for <hi>Lumber</hi> among the Ladies, I have peruſed with ſome Attention Mr. <hi>Hoyle</hi>'s very judicious and elegant Book on the Game of <hi>Whiſt;</hi> by which Means I can now return my Partner's Suit, lead through the Honour, <hi>Fineſſe,</hi> and ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to bring about an agreeable <hi>See-ſaw.</hi> With this profound Knowledge I was punctual to my Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, that I might ſee the whole Ceremony of the Proceeding, took Care to be pretty early in my Viſit.</p>
                  <p>My Lady <hi>Tenace</hi> is a Woman of perfect Good-breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and has a very happy Flow of Spirits; her Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity is, perhaps, as extenſive as that of any of her Sex; but from a conſtant Habit of attending to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0311400901:54"/>but the odd Trick, ſhe has not laid up ſo large a Store of Ideas, as ſhe might have done by a proper Improvement of her Underſtanding; thoſe Ideas which ſhe is poſſeſſed of, are in a conſtant Rotation, and ſhe never dwells long upon any Subject, but is always ſure to ſay ſomething lively upon every Thing that offers. Her Ladyſhip began to rally me with a deal of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry upon my being a public Writer, when, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> would have it, a loud Rap at the Door ſhook the whole Houſe. I have often wondered at this ſtrange Din, with which, even though the Entry ſtands wide open, our Ears are always to be ſtunned upon theſe Occaſions. As the Company comes to a <hi>Rout,</hi> it is poſſible this may make Part of the Ceremony, and, beſides the Pleaſure of alarming a whole Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, I ſuppoſe the Ladies may think, that, what with the Thunder below Stairs, and the Lightning in their Eyes, they ſail into a Room with a greater Eclat.</p>
                  <p>This was the Caſe with Mrs. <hi>Fidget;</hi> after ſhe had ſeated herſelf in her Chair, twiſted her Body two or three Times to compoſe herſelf, adjuſted the ſparkling Croſs upon her Neck, and given a Diſcharge to her Fan—<q>Lard, my Lady <hi>Tenace,</hi> ſays ſhe, I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that I ſhould not be able to wait upon your Ladyſhip—My poor little Dog <hi>Pompey</hi>—the ſweeteſt little Thing in the World—I went, Me'm, the other Morning to fetch a Walk in the Park— a fine froſty Morning it was—I love froſty Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Things—and ſo, little <hi>Pompey</hi> was with me—and if your Ladyſhip was but to ſee the dear Creature pinched with the Froſt, and mincing its Steps along the Mall—with its pretty little innocent Face—and ſo, Me'm, while I was talking to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Flimſy</hi>—your Ladyſhip knows Captain <hi>Flimſy</hi> —five odious Frights of Dogs beſet my poor <hi>Pompey</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0311400901:55"/>all at once, Me'm—the dear Creature has the Heart of a Lion—but who can reſiſt ſix at once—and ſo <hi>Pompey</hi> barked for Aſſiſtance, and the hideous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures made their Eſcape—The Hurt my little Dog met with was on his Cheſt—and, Me'm, there is really Danger that an <hi>Empyema</hi> is now forming in his Side. And ſo, Me'm—Lard, is not <hi>Barry</hi> a fine Man?—You have ſeen the <hi>Rehearſal</hi> to be ſure, Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi>—Well, to be ſure, <hi>Garrick</hi>'s a ſurpriſing little Fellow, his Eyes have ſo much Life, and ſuch Meaning, and ſuch Fire, and he has ſuch Variety! —They ſay ſhort Aprons are coming into Faſhion again.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Time the Room began to fill, and it was Time to diſpoſe the Company at their ſeveral Stations for the Night. Several Card Tables were accordingly ſituated in different Parts of the Room, and in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Apartment, a Brag-Table was prepared for thoſe who are fond of that Game. The Thoughts of the whole Company began immediately to flow into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Channel; they who were before happy in a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Intercourſe of ſocial Pleaſure, became of a ſudden ſecret Enemies to each other, and every one had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign on his Neighbour's Pocket. I ſhould think this ſtrange Scene would afford many nice Touches to the Pencil of an <hi>Hogarth;</hi> and it would not fail of being highly entertaining, to ſee the different Effects of the ſame Paſſion operating upon a Number of People, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their reſpective Tempers, and various Ideas of Winning and Loſing. To mark this with Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and to blend the private Habits of each diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Character with it, would, in my Opinion, ſhow a nice Diſcernment, and be worthy of a maſterly Hand to execute it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0311400901:56"/>After a Rubber or two at Whiſt, I detached myſelf from the Party I was joined to, in order to take a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the Room, and I could not help wondering how Men, amid ſuch a Proſuſion of Charms as the Ladies diſplayed, could fit ſo cool and attentive to their Game; and I obſerved that the Queen of Trumps (groteſque and unnatural as the Figure is) was the <hi>Venus</hi> of every Gentleman preſent. It is the Intereſt of the Ladies not to encourage a Gameſter; for if this ſhould become the ruling Paſſion of the Men, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the Toilet are all in vain; in vain may the Fair dreſs themſelves in Smiles; in vain heave the tender Breaſt; Cards have baniſhed Love, and ſo adieu to the female Reign.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all: if this Taſte continues, not only Love, but Beauty is at Stake, and the Odds are greatly againſt it. While the amiable, but delicate Sex, ſit in painful Durance at a Card Table, the liquid Luſtre of the Eye is extinguiſhed, the Roſes fade upon the Cheek, and uneaſy Paſſions deface the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. <hi>Amanda</hi> is, at preſent, in all the Pride of Beauty; her is Stature tall and genteel; ſhe boaſts a regular and elegant Set of Features; her Bloom glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Poet's Fancy; a mild Radiance beams from her Eyes; there is ſuch an inexpreſſible Delicacy about her Mouth, that it is intirely the <hi>Beuche gracieuſe</hi> of the <hi>French,</hi> and over her whole Countenance is diſplayed the moſt winning Sweetneſs; and ſtill Cards render <hi>Amanda</hi> unamiable. The Moment ſhe ſat down to Brag, I could ſee the young Loves and Graces, that were ambuſhed in every Feature, ſpread their little Wings, and a diſagreeable Expreſſion immediately ſucceeded. I could not bear to hear ſo exquiſite a Beauty with a confirmed Voice tell a forward young Fellow, that "truly ſhe would not be bullied by "him;" and to ſee thoſe Lips, which were framed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0311400901:57"/>for the tendereſt Purpoſes, gnawed with Vexation, was Matter of great Uneaſineſs to me. But the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, which Mrs. <hi>Pregnant</hi> gave me, are not to be expreſſed. The Emotions, which ſhe ſhewed upon fix Aces being diſcovered in one Pack, will, I am afraid, bring her Child into the World with a convulſed Set of Nerves, and I would venture to <hi>lay an even Bet</hi> that it will be marked with a Pair-royal of Aces.</p>
                  <p>When a Paſſion for Play becomes predominant in the married State, I believe it requires no very lively Imagination to conceive the Scene that muſt enſue; not to mention the Ruin of a Family, their own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Happineſs is deſtroyed; as the Poet finely ſays,
<q>
                        <l>Love ſhall be baniſh'd from the genial Bed,</l>
                        <l>The Night ſhall be all lonely and unquiet,</l>
                        <l>And every Day ſhall be a Day of Cares.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I perceive that you frequently detach yourſelf from the more ſerious Buſineſs of a Public Writer in order to mix with the <hi>Beau Monde,</hi> and that you ſtill retain great Attention to the amiable Sex, as you politely call the Ladies, I muſt beg you will permit one of them to break in upon your Studies.</p>
                        <p>You muſt know, Sir, that I have hitherto been of that Species of Women called COQUETTES; I was initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into this Science in my greener Yearr, and the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0311400901:60"/>whole Courſe of my Education conſpired with other Circumſtances againſt me. My Mamma took early Pains to train me up in this Way, and the Attendants, I had about me, all joined to infuſe the ſame Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into my Mind; as if they had made a Point of it, to reader me egregiouſly ridiculous. From a Child I promiſed to make a fine Woman, as the Phraſe is; my Features were regular, and I muſt add, did not want Delicacy; and I had a Bloom that greatly enlivened my whole Countenance. The Leſſon conſtantly rung in my Ears was, that <q>Miſs ſhould hold up her Head —and put forth her Cheſt—and one Day or other, ſhe would become a celebrated Toaſt, and then the Men would all be expiring for her.</q>—This you may believe was flattering to my Fancy, and to give the laſt Finiſhing to my Accompliſhments for this State of Felicity, I was put into the Hands of a <hi>French</hi> Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-maſter.</p>
                        <p>From this Gentleman I acquired a thouſand name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Arts of Affectation, and he not only undertook the Direction of my Carriage in the graceful Movement of a Minuet, and the more ſprightly Gambols of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Dance, but the Management of my Features be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came alſo Part of his Concern. He let me into the whole Secret of the elevated Brow, the languiſhing Glance, and the ſleepy Eye; he inſtructed me when to diſplay the ſnowy Breaſt, to move with the eaſy indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Carriage, to throw the whole Perſon into a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Attitude, and, after obſerving that it is a Thing very rare in theſe Kingdoms, taught me the whole Uſe of the Hands in every Circumſtance at Cards or Converſation; though it was not without ſome Pains, that I attained the Method of taking Snuff with a proper Air and art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſplay of the Fingers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0311400901:61"/>There are a thouſand Artifices to make up for the Deficiency of Chat in Company, and in all theſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as regular as a Piece of Clock-work. Add to this, that he recommended to me a great Variety of <hi>French</hi> Romances, Novels, and Memoirs of Ladies of Quality; and to complete the whole, he told me one Day with a mighty ſerious Air, that I really had an immenſe Share of Wit. In this Notion I was further conſirmed by Monſieur <hi>Lojeuneſſe,</hi> my Hair-cutter; <q>I aſſure it you, Madam,</q> 
                           <hi>ſays he,</hi> as my Hair was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the proper Adjuſtment from his Finger, <q>you have indeed ver much <hi>Eſprit.</hi>—Wherever I go to dreſs de Gentleman, it is all dying for you.— You have dem in Chains, Madam, — pon my Vord, — juſt as I have dis Lock here in my Hand — pray hold your Head a leetle more aſide, — and all de Ladies envy your Eclat, I aſſure it you, Madam.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Charmed with theſe Ideas of my Perſon, my Breaſt was fired with the Love of Conqueſt, and the Thoughts of being a Wit quite intoxicated me; it was enough to turn my little Head; for let me tell you, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> Wit is the moſt dangerous Thing a Woman can think of, becauſe it generally ruins the Share of Underſtanding Heaven has been pleaſed to beſtow upon her. I was not content to ſay or do any Thing in the common Way, and I read <hi>Rochefoucault</hi>'s <hi>Various Thoughts,</hi> in order to retail his brilliant Sayings again in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; I am ſure you would laugh at me, were you to ſee the Pains I took to diſtinguiſh myſelf in all Places of public Diverſion. I think I remember ſomething in a Poet that may help you to an Idea of my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>

My Heart danced within me to hear <hi>Clarinda</hi> in the <hi>Suſpicious Husband,</hi> utter with an Air, <hi>Any Woman can give Eaſe;</hi> I diſdained ſo poor an Accompliſhment; and to cauſe Pain and Uneaſineſs was the Buſineſs of my Life. To ſee that the Fellows could not be eaſy with me, nor without me, was the Joy of my Soul; I read all our modern Comedies to glean up the Airs of the fine Women, and I was delighted, like Lady <hi>Betty Modiſh,</hi> to hear a tortured Lover bring out;
<q>
                              <l>Yet for the Curſe of human Race</l>

                        <p>Whenever I could meet with a Man of Parts and Senſe, my higheſt Ambition was to enſnare him; ſuch a one I had a Pride to lead in Captivity, and in Spite of all his boaſted Reaſon, to play upon his Paſſions, gave me the moſt exquiſite Pleaſure. <hi>Favonius</hi> is one of this Claſs; he has Underſtanding, without affecting it; his Wit is always tempered with good Nature and Politeneſs; he is as handſome as moſt of his Sex, and there is no Requiſite in the Character of a Gentleman, but what he is poſſeſſed of. With theſe Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he became my profeſſed humble Servant, and though he made Love to me in a Manner hardly reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible, I delighted in tormenting him; if we were at a I lay together, I took Pleaſure in pointing out to him ſeveral young Fellows, whom I pretended to be charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with; one I obſerved had the fineſt Set of Teeth, and the prettieſt Smile in the World; another the handſomeſt Forehead, and the moſt delightful Eyes; a third had a becoming Head of Hair, and Abundance of Wit; and though an Under-actor perhaps was on the Stage, I vowed he was a charming Man. In a Country-dance, when I perceived his Spirits elevated, I
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0311400901:63"/>have ſat down of a ſudden, told him I was tired, and immediately after begged of him to let me take one Turn wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>This Incident, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> has opened my Eyes, and I now perceive, that I have been all this Time vainly aiming at imaginary Triumphs, and that all my Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were like the Wars of the <hi>French</hi> King in <hi>Flanders;</hi> ſerving merely to extend Conqueſts, which are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards not to be aſcertained.

To convince you that I am in earneſt on this Occaſion, I beg you will annex to this Letter the incloſed Paper, by which you will ſee that I am entering upon a new Plan of Life without Delay, and your Compliance will great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblige, Sir,</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is not in the whole Province of an Author, a Point of greater Difficulty to attain than what is called a good Stile, an Expreſſion which is in every Body's Mouth, but, as I take it, very little underſtood by the preſent Critics. I ſhall endeavour, in this Paper, to reduce into ſome Sort of Order the ſeveral ſcattered Thoughts which recurred to my Mind upon this Subject, in a vague Manner, a few Days ſince.</p>
                  <p>The Term <hi>Stile,</hi> if I miſtake not, is derived from the <hi>Stylus</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was an Inſtrument uſed by them in Writing upon Wax, one End of it faſhioned to cut the Letters, and the other formed to efface the Impreſſion, whenever it ſhould be judged proper. Hence <hi>Horace</hi> adviſes a Writer who would aſpire to the Fame of being worth Reading, to turn his <hi>Stile</hi>-very often, that is, to rub out and alter the Arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Choice of his Words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Saepe ſtylum vertas, iterum quae digna legi ſunt</l>
                     <l>Scripturus, —</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>From this turning and altering is deducible the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Expreſſion, which is a proper Choice of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0311400901:69"/>Words in a regular and harmonious Diſpoſition. This requires a great deal of Art, and without a juſt Senſe of the Force and Beauty of Language, can never be performed in any Degree of Perfection: In ſome we never can perceive the leaſt Tendency towards it, which renders their Works not very palatable to the Reader; and in thoſe who have by Practice cultivated this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, it is an Embelliſhment to good Senſe, gives a Luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre and Elegance to every Thing the Author advances, and renders his Productions pleaſing and inviting. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are to be found ſeveral Critics, from whoſe Works a good plodding Head may extract very ſound and ſenſible Obſervations upon all Branches of Literature; but while there are thoſe who treat the ſame Subject with a delicate Touch, he muſt be lamentably dull that would have Recourſe to the former; and while <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus, Addiſon</hi> and <hi>Spence</hi> are not loſt to us, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commentators will lie mouldering on Stalls, and in the duſty Libraries of inſipid Pedants.</p>
                  <p>To attempt to lay down Rules for the Acquirement of this Quality, might perhaps carry with it an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a tacit Declaration that I am Maſter of it myſelf, which I am far from the Vanity of believing; but it appears to me, that what Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> mentions as the chief Thing to be attended to in the Conduct of the Underſtanding, is alſo a neceſſary Step towards this Accompliſhment. The Thing, I mean, is an Habit of <hi>Thinking in Train</hi> on whatever Subject the Mind may chuſe to expatiate upon, by which Means our Thoughts will follow in a natural Order, each ariſing and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the former, and the whole connected in all its Parts, will by theſe Means be a regular Compoſition, which at one Glance the Reader may take in and carry in his Mind. There is an Aſſociation between almoſt all our Ideas, and whenever one of them preſents itſelf to the Imagination, an whole Train is wakened into
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0311400901:70"/>Life; ſo that if an Author has enlarged his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and enriched himſelf with a tolerable Stock of Knowledge, he need not be apprehenſive but his Thoughts will offer faſt enough, and that too, if he has habituated himſelf to the Government of his Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties above deſcribed in a regular Series. This would prevent that violent Straining very perceptible in ſome Gentlemen of the Quill, that Manner of flying off from one Subject to another in a wild incoherent. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which ſerves only to bewilder the Reader, who expects ſomething of Method, and not being able to attend his Author into the Realms of Chaos and old Night, he throws him aſide as a vague wandering Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, whom he can make nothing of.</p>
                  <p>I am aware that what has been premiſed may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to an haſty Peruſer, digreſſive from the Matter I firſt ſet out with; but Thinking is ſo intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with what is called Stile, that it is intirely co-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident with the Deſign of this Eſſay, and is ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a Compoſition, that without it Elegance can never be expected, and with it, it is odds that it will never be wanting. To furniſh the Mind with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is a Rule of the ableſt of Critics, and Words, ſays he, will never be deficient to cloath our Ideas.</p>
                  <p>To think clearly therefore is the original Source of good Writing, and he who conſiders things with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity, will alſo aim at the ſame in conveying his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents to others. This is the main Uſe of Language, and on this Account a good Writer will avoid all Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Glittering, all falſe ambitious Ornaments, all Prettineſſes, all Conceits, quaint Turns, Points and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſes, which never can give Strength to an Argument, and only ſerve to enervate and corrupt the Imagination. As no Language can poſſibly have a Competency of Terms appropriated to every different Idea, Recourſe was had to the Metaphor; which conſiſts in transferring the Name of one Object to another, on Account of ſome
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0311400901:71"/>Reſemblance ſubſiſting between them; but by this, in the Nature of Things, it never could be intended that an whole Piece ſhould be carried on in a String of borrowed Phraſes. Every body knows how cloying this Manner is in ſome of the moſt eminent Writers of the laſt Century; and it would not be hard to point out ſome of the preſent Tribe, who put off every Thing in ſuch a motly Mixture of far-fetched Terms and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, that the Senſe is hid under a Flouriſh of tuneful Periods, which by the injudicious is called a good Stile and a pretty Flow. <hi>Cicero,</hi> the Father of Eloquence, and the excellent <hi>Quintilian,</hi> in ſeveral Paſſages have condemned the two frequent Inſertion of Metaphors; and <hi>Vida,</hi> who was both a Poet and a Critic, has ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly deſcribed thoſe Writers, who diſdain to expreſs their Thoughts in the Terms appropriated to them, and though, the Subject does not require it, muſt need ſet off every Thing in the deluſive Colouring of figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Language.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Namquè aliqui exercent vim duram, &amp; rebus iniqui</l>
                     <l>Nativam eripiunt formam, indignantibus ipſis,</l>
                     <l>Invitaſque jubent alienos ſumere vultus.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>I believe the late Dean <hi>Swift</hi> underſtood the true genuine Beauties of Writing as well as any Author, antient or modern, and I would adviſe the Reader to open any Part of his Works, and try whether he can find any Thing of this florid Manner, that at preſent ſerves to <hi>elevate and ſurprize.</hi> I am convinced that no Man of common Apprehenſion need ever read a Sentence twice over in any of this Writer's Productions; his Method is perſpicuous, and at the ſame time elegant, without falſe Embelliſhments, and his Metaphors all bearing a palpable Alluſion to the Thing they are introduced to ſignify. This is a Point which ſhould be always be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0311400901:72"/>conſidered, and even then they ſhould not be ſowed too thick, nor purſued with a pitiful Ambition to too great a Length. Whenever I find a Perſon erring on this Head, he appears to me in the Light of a Child, who has blown a Bubble prettily variegated and pleaſing to his Fancy, and then follows it in order to keep up the Illuſion as long as he can. In ſhort, it has happened in Language as in Commerce: What was firſt intended to ſupply our natural Deficiencies, is now by the Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the human Mind perverted into a Vice; the Tranſgreſſion on the one Hand has been ſufficiently condemned by all Moraliſts, and in the Eye of a juſt Critic nothing can be more blameable than a Luxury of Words.</p>
                  <p>I know there are many other Corruptions which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to vitiate a true Taſte; but I have dwelt longer on this, as it appears to me to be the reigning Fault of all our pretty Eſſayiſts at preſent. But if Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor is conſidered in the Light I have ſtated it, as only an Aid to the Perſpicuity of Language; it will no longer paſs for an Elegance, when it is not ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to its original Inſtitution. Add to this, that all tedious Circumlocution ſhould be quite exploded, tho' it is an excellent Subterfuge to him, who wants to ſpin out the Sheet: To be a great while ſaying and ſaying nothing, helps out many a <hi>tritical Eſſay</hi> Writer. A Multiplicity of Words of the ſame Import, with a Profuſion of Epithets, is alſo very uſeful upon a Pinch, but, I believe, it is unneceſſary to obſerve, that there cannot be a greater Error; it ſhould alſo be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that every Species of Writing has its peculiar Manner, and its own proper Colouring, and whenever the diſtinguiſhing Qualities of each are not preſerved, whenever the different Boundaries are invaded, then all Propriety in Writing is deſtroyed. A true Stile ſhould be clear of all foreign Infuſions, like the River
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0311400901:73"/>
                     <hi>Marſyas,</hi> which <hi>Curtius</hi> tells us glides pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed within the Fortifications of a Town in <hi>Aſia,</hi> free from any adventitious Waters to pollute the lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Stream; but when without the Walls, it pours along with a more impetuous Current, and a ſwelling Surge, it no longer retains its original Name, but then commences to be ſtiled the River <hi>Lycus: cum extra mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimenta ſe evolvit, majore vi ac mole agentem undas Lycum appellant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Choice of our Words, the Arrangement of them is to be attended to, and in this conſiſts a great deal of the Writer's Art. The Reference which the ſeveral Terms in a Sentence bear to one another; the Strength they acquire by being joined with proper Epithets, the Luſtre they reflect upon an whole Period when diſpoſed with ſuch an artful Brevity, that nothing is perplexed or entangled, are all Points of Moment in a Compoſition, and at the ſame Time that they render every Thing clearer, they give Grace and Harmony to the Whole.</p>

                  <p>An ingenious Fellow of the Royal Society, by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the preſent Attraction between the upper End of a Lady's Stays and the lower Part of the Petticoat, has demonſtrated that in leſs than Three Years they muſt both meet at the Centre of Gravity; but allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Motion to be accelerated, according to the Laws of Attraction between all natural Bodies, the nearer they approach, he does not doubt, but they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximate conſiderably by the next Maſquerade.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N a former Paper I mentioned, that I belong to a Club, which meets once in every Week, at the <hi>Devil Tavern,</hi> near <hi>Temple-Bar;</hi> I then promiſed my Readers to make them acquainted with the Nature of this Meeting, the Characters of the ſeveral Members, and the Oddities in my own Temper, which entitle me to a Place in this extraordinary Society, and therefore I ſhall make an Account of it the Subject of this Day's Lucubration.</p>
                  <p>Our Club is called the <hi>Club of Originals.</hi> By an <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> we do not mean, a Character entirely new, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0311400901:76"/>ſuch as has never been ſeen in the World before; but we intend by it a Perſon of an independent Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whoſe diſtinguiſhing Marks are not contracted by an affected Imitation of others, but are abſolutely native and conſtitutional in the very Frame and Temper of his Mind. As I had the Honour of filling the Chair the laſt Club Night, I ſhall begin with myſelf, though I am aware that a public Writer ſhould remain as much behind the Curtain as poſſible, on Account of the Prejudices which ariſe againſt a known Author.</p>
                  <p>I have, perhaps, as many Whims in my Turn of Mind, as any Man whatever, and they adhere to me ſo tenaciouſly, that I cannot diſengage myſelf from them. Notwithſtanding all the Pains I have been at, I cannot induce myſelf to carry a ſupernumerary Ace in my Pocket to a Brag-table; I could never contract an Intimacy in a Gentleman's Family, in order to debauch his Daughter, or carry on a Deſign upon his Wife; I had rather loſe my Joke at any Time, than my Friend; and I am ſo aukward, that I cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to bilk a Box-keeper. Add to this, I am far from being a Free-thinker, notwithſtanding the very great Reputation to be acquired by it. I am ſenſible, that theſe are unaccountable Oddities, and it does not eſcape me, that in ſo enlightened and accompliſhed an Age as this, they muſt ſet a Man in a very diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Light; but the Truth of it is, they have taken ſuch Root in my Mind, that I am apprehenſive, I ſhall never be able to attain that Elegance of Life and Taſte, which is remarkable in ſome of my Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>The next who is to ſit for his Picture, is a Gentleman of the moſt extenſive Knowledge in all Branches of polite Literature. His Name is CANDID, remarkable for his Knowledge in Critical Learning; but what conſtitutes the Oddity of his Character is, that he is a <hi>Critic</hi> with Good-nature. No Man has quicker Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0311400901:77"/>than Mr. <hi>Candid,</hi> and hence it reſults that in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſing the Works of Antiquity, or thoſe Writers among the Moderns of allowed Reputation, their beautiful Paſſages ſtrike ſo forcibly on his Imagination, that he admires them to a Degree of Rapture. It may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that this Warmth of Temper hurries him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into a falſe Applauſe, but his Judgment is ſo deliberate, that he generally withholds his Admiration till he is perfectly ſatisfied that the Sentiment and Diction are juſt, and he is never known to be impoſed upon by falſe Embelliſhments of Stile, or thoſe ambitious Ornaments in Writing, which are cenſured by <hi>Horace.</hi> To this Refinement of Taſte, Mr. <hi>Candid</hi> has joined the moſt finiſhed good Breeding, which renders his Company extremely deſirable, and he is a Source from whence thoſe of his Acquaintance derive many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Obſervations upon every Kind of different Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Abraham Gulliver</hi> follows in Order of Succeſſion to the Chair, a Gentleman of very diverting Humours, and deſcended, as he himſelf informs us, from that very <hi>Gulliver</hi> whoſe Travels have been collected, with ſo much Accuracy, by the late Doctor <hi>Swift.</hi> The Love of recounting Adventures I believe runs in his Blood, and he frequently ſets the Company a ſtaring at the ſurprizing Incidents he has met with. His Paſſion for voyaging was formerly ſo prevalent in him, that he never omitted an Opportunity of <hi>ſailing for it,</hi> as he expreſſes it, and merely to gratify this Inclination he embarked in Lord <hi>Anſon</hi>'s Squadron found the World. He has loſt one Eye and Part of his Chin in that Expedition, but he does not repine at the Accident, as he ſays it is made up to him in the Acquirement of Knowledge, which, he inſiſts, no Man can be ſaid to poſſeſs, who has not croſſed the Line, and attempted the North-Eaſt Paſſage. He has converſed with a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0311400901:78"/>
                     <hi>Bramin</hi> in the Eaſt; and there is no Place in the Map, of which he cannot give ſome Account. He certainly has laid up a large Fund of Knowledge, but that tinged with ſo many Oddities, that he is a whimſical Member of Society.</p>
                  <p>After Mr. <hi>Gulliver,</hi> my Friend <hi>Harry Wildair,</hi> whom I have mentioned in a former Paper, as my Coadjutor in the Articles of Intelligence, claims our Attention. <hi>Harry Wildair</hi> has a quick Inſight into Men and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and No-body better knows the characteriſtic Marks and latent Foibles of all whom he meets in the ſocial Intercourſe of Life. Joined to this Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Diſcernment he has made great Enquiry into the Connections and Buſineſs of Mankind, and is actuated by ſo ſtrong a Deſire of Novelty, that he has fixed his Reſidence at <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> that he may have an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of obſerving the mighty Throng, which is conſtantly preſſing that Way. He can tell, by the Coat of Arms, to whom each paſſing Coach belongs, and if by Chance a Vehicle unobſerved before occurs to him, he is ſure to run after it through nine or ten Streets, in order to ſatisfy his Curioſity. In ſhort, my Friend <hi>Wildair</hi> is all Spirit and Frolick; is foremoſt in every Scene both in high and low Life, and he is equally pleaſant upon the finer Foibles of the polite, and the ſtrong Humours of the inferior Claſs, from whence it reſults that he is never without a Fund of Gallantry and Humour, and his Converſation abounds with a gay and ſprightly Variety.</p>
                  <p>The next of the Society is Counſellor <hi>Plaſtic</hi> of the <hi>Inner Temple.</hi> Counſellor <hi>Plaſtic</hi> was called to the Bar in the Year 1740, but the Death of his elder Brother ſoon rendering it unneceſſary for him to attend his Profeſſion, he laid aſide the long Robe, and has ſince indulged himſelf in the Gratification of his natural Caſt of Mind. Inſtead of Walking in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> he takes a Turn every Day in the <hi>Lyceum,</hi> or
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0311400901:79"/>ſaunters in the Groves of <hi>Academus.</hi> In plain Terms, Mr. <hi>Plaſtic</hi> is a compleat <hi>Shafteſburian</hi> Philoſopher; like all the Gentlemen of that inclining, he has a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Taſte for the imitative Arts; his Imagination is warm and elegant, and he has entirely a <hi>Muſe-like</hi> Apprehenſion. With all this there is a Peculiarity in every Thing he ſays or does; the Chriſtian Syſtem cannot ſtand his Art in Ridicule, which he calls the Teſt of Truth, and he adores a Deity of his own making. The Doctrine of Rewards and Puniſhments is to him abominable, and his Diſcourſe generally turns on Ideas of Beauty and Virtue. Beſides the five Senſes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with his Neighbours, this Gentleman has a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senſe, a Senſe of Honour, a public Senſe, an internal Senſe, and many other Powers of Perception, not mentioned in <hi>Locke</hi>'s Eſſay, which is, in my humble Opinion, the moſt accurate Hiſtory of the human Mind. In ſhort, Counſellor <hi>Plaſtic</hi>'s Imagination has attained a great Degree of Refinement, and his diſintereſted Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence is frequently laughed at by Mr. <hi>Allcaſh,</hi> who ſtands laſt upon the Liſt.</p>
                  <p>It is owing to a Whim of this Gentleman's, that our Meeting is fixed at the <hi>Devil Tavern,</hi> as he has made a Reſolution never to go beyond the Bar. Mr. <hi>Allcaſh</hi> is eſteemed to be worth half a Plum, and is now pretty well recovered from the Shock he received by the Reduction of Intereſt. As he has ſpent moſt of his Time in a conſtant Intercourſe with Scriveners and Stock-jobbers, he has diſcovered the Artifices of that Claſs of Men, and he is ſatisfied from that partial View of Mankind, that he knows the World. He is extremely fond of a Maxim in <hi>Hudibras;</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>What is Worth in any Thing,</l>
                        <l>But ſo much Money as 'twill bring?</l>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0311400901:80"/>This with him is the Teſt of Truth, which he oppoſes in his joking Way to the <hi>Shafteſburian</hi> Rule; he declares, that he had rather have a Senſe of Money, than all the elegant Senſes above mentioned; and he is a conſtant Attendant at Church, as he ſays, from a ſincere Motive of Piety, though it is hinted by Mr. <hi>Plaſtic,</hi> that he does this becauſe he thinks it is his <hi>Intereſt</hi> to be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Members of the Club of ORIGINALS, which has been inſtituted upon the Commencement of this Paper, and as we are willing, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Deſign of it, to admit new Members, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals will be received, and treated with the utmoſt Impartiality.</p>
                  <p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>French</hi> are very often happy in an Expreſſion, which cannot be rendered with equal Delicacy in any other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Language. Of this Sort is a Phraſe I have ſomewhere met with, <hi>viz. Les petites Morales,</hi> which is uſed by them to ſignify thoſe ſubordinate Points of Behaviour, which cannot be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon in the ſame Light with Concerns of an higher Moment, but are, however, ſo eſſential to our Conduct in Life, that they are thence denominated <hi>leſſer Morals.</hi> A ſmall Share of common Senſe will point theſe out to every Man's Obſervation; but as the Infringement of them is frequent, and very often attended with ſerious Conſequences, it properly comes within the Province of a public Writer to correct theſe leſſer Deviations, and therefore I have ſet apart this Day to animadvert upon a Tranſgreſſion of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>The Offence I mean is the notable Art of HUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BUGGING, which ſtarted up of late Years, and has made ſuch an extenſive Progreſs, that it is now enlarged into a general Faſhion, and calls aloud for a CENSOR. And here it may not be improper to remind People of the true Definition of Wit, which conſiſts in reconciling I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas, between which there is no palpable Congruity, in a ſudden lively Aſſociation. To this I will add, that Humour is the Talent of diſcerning the Oddities which conſtitute the great Variety of Characters this
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0311400901:83"/>Kingdom is famous for, and exhibiting them in ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Colours to the Eye of the World. Things being thus circumſtanced, I would ask the Tribe of HUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BUGGERS, how far a plauſible Lie, with a grave Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, will give them a Pretenſion to either of the two Faculties above deſcribed? The Truth of it is, they are but pitiful Attendants on the Camp of falſe Wit; and if they would conſider how eaſily it is to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſify, and how hard to do it with Pleaſantry, they would, in my Opinion, deſiſt from ſo unpolite an Art, than which I do not remember any thing more groſs, more ſtupid, and more ſenſeleſs. An Author of the firſt Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude (I think the late Dr. <hi>Swift</hi>) obſerves, that he never knew above one good Lie in his Life; and that one, I will venture to ſay, was told by himſelf, and we may believe was a Stroke of Humour, free from Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal or Detraction, the diſtinguiſhing Characteriſticks of our modern Adventurers in this Way.</p>
                  <p>As one of theſe elegant Gentlemen is over his Tea in a Morning, his Hand is applied with great Sagacity to his Forehead — <q>Let me ſee now, for an arch Hum—ſomething curſed high for the Day—Ay, ay, I have it—A Suit is commenced in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Court againſt a certain Lord—It will be inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent though to meddle with ſuch reſpectable Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters—Well, but there is Ill-nature in it, and ſo it will do ſwimmingly—as how—Why—he's mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the fineſt Woman in the World—Her whole Sex envy her, and Envy vents itſelf in Malice and Detraction—that's the Thing—it will ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them—Immenſe by G—d.—</q> So away runs he, as quick as Lightning, to my Lady TATTLE-AID's Toilet, with a Face as long as a <hi>Dutch</hi> Epigram; then the Hum begins—<q>I am extremely ſorry for it, <hi>cries the Wag</hi>—It's a cruel Caſe—<hi>Pray, Sir, what's a cruel Caſe?</hi>—Why, have not you heard,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0311400901:84"/>Ma'am?—My Lord—(hark in your Ear)—abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely fact—two Wives—I'd lay all <hi>Lombard-Street</hi> to an Egg-ſhell that it's true. Your Ladyſhip knows <hi>Tom Wildfire.</hi>—<hi>Tom</hi> went this Morning for a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to be married to Miſs <hi>Beverley,</hi> the great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and he brings the News piping hot from the Commons.—" "Lard, ſays my Lady <hi>Tattleaid,</hi> I don't know how it was — I never liked that Match —<hi>(and caſting her Eyes on the Glaſs with a conſcious Simper)</hi>—What ſignifies all her Beauty now?— Though ſhe was never my Beauty—I don't find that thoſe tall Women are ſo much admired in public Places — Mrs. <hi>Needlework,</hi> bid <hi>John</hi> come round with the Coach to the Door,—and bring me my Fan, Gloves, and Capuchin in an Inſtant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Affair is ſettled: away flies my Lady <hi>Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleaid,</hi> on the Wings of Malice, to all Parts of the Town, and thus the agreeable News is wafted about. At <hi>White</hi>'s Bets are extremely high, a Wager being the only Teſt of Truth, which the ingenious Gentlemen of that Academy have been able to diſcover, after infinite Pains in the Search. A loſing Gameſter, who is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to drive into the City to diſpoſe of a little <hi>South Sea</hi> Stock, gives the Hint there. The Goſſips at <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raway</hi>'s have it in a Moment: At One it is buzz'd on <hi>Change,</hi> and the circulating Whiſper in the Boxes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupts the Play at Night. At my Lady <hi>Trumpabout</hi>'s Aſſembly, the Ladies are all in a Titter. <q>Is it come to this? cries Miſs <hi>Sparkiſh,</hi> I'll brag a Guinea over—" "But is it really true, ſays Miſs <hi>Whiteteeth,</hi> I ſhall be very ſorry for it—he! he! he!—Can one go to hear it tried?—I'll ſend to beſpeak Places.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pleaſed with theſe Ideas, the Ladies retire home from the Rout, ſink into a comfortable Repoſe, dream of Divorces, Separations, and unhappy Beauties, till the next Day the Cheat is diſcovered; the Illuſion vaniſhes;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0311400901:85"/>the noble Lord proves to be above the Reach of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous a Calumny, and his Lady, ſuperior to Envy, moves in her Sphere with Luſtre, Grace, and Dignity; while the Droll, who firſt ſet the Thing on foot, enjoys the Joke in ſecret, and laughs at the Tale his Faceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs propagated. And in this is contained all the Wit, and all the Humour, and all the Fun of all the <hi>Humbuggers</hi> of the Age.</p>
                  <p>I could wiſh that this Tribe had ſubſiſted in the Days of <hi>Horace;</hi> becauſe then we ſhould have them, under ſome proper Appellation, delivered down to Poſterity with the
<q>
                        <l>Ambubaiarum collegia, Pharmacopolae,</l>
                        <l>Mendici, Mimi, Balatrones, hoc Genus omne:</l>
                     </q> But I do not think that the polite Authors of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> ſeem to have the fainteſt Idea of this egregious Turn. In all the Characters of <hi>La Bruyere</hi> there is no ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to be found; the Wits of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Time were abſolutely ignorant of it. In the Reign of Queen ANNE, <hi>which</hi> (to uſe the Words of a fine Author) <hi>notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the happy Days that have ſucceeded, every</hi> BRITON <hi>may yet remember,</hi> I ſay, in the Reign of Queen ANNE, when Wit, Humour, Imagination, and every elegant Talent, were in their higheſt Perfection, nothing of this Sort aroſe. In ſhort, it ſeems entirely reſerved to grace the Annals of theſe latter Days; and I make no doubt but it will give a ſurpriſing Eclat to the Pages of ſome future Hiſtorian, to have it related in a pompous Stile, that in the Reign of his Majeſty King <hi>George</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by the Grace of God, King of <hi>Great-Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Defender of the Faith, and ſo forth, the never enough to be admired Art of <hi>Humbugging</hi> came into Vogue, and was the Amuſement of Tea Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0311400901:86"/>the Delight of the Court, and the Study of Beaux and pretty Gentlemen, from whom it deſcended to all Ranks of People, and became the general Faſhion of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of expatiating any further on this ſprightly Abſurdity, I ſhall cloſe this Paper with a Paſſage from Lord <hi>Shaftſbury,</hi> whoſe Deciſion upon Wit and Manners, I believe, will not be conteſted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>'Tis real Humanity and Kindneſs to hide ſtrong Truths from tender Eyes; and to do this by pleaſant Amuſement, is eaſier and civiller, than by a harſh Denial, or remarkable Reſerve. But to go about induſtriouſly to confound Men in a myſterious Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to make Advantage, and draw Pleaſure from that Perplexity they are thrown into by ſuch uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Talk, is as unhandſome in a Way of Raillery, as when done with the greateſt Seriouſneſs, or in the moſt ſolemn Way of Deceit. It may be neceſſary, as well now as heretofore, for wiſe Men to ſpeak in Parables, with a double Meaning, that the Enemy may be amuſed, and they only <hi>who have Ears to hear, may hear;</hi> but it is certainly a mean, impotent, and dull Sort of Wit which amuſes all alike, and leaves the moſt ſenſible Man, and even a Friend, equally in Doubt, and at a Loſs to underſtand what one's real Mind is upon any Subject. This is that groſs Sort of Raillery which is ſo offenſive in good Company; and indeed there is as much Difference between one Sort and another, as between fair Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hypocriſy, or between the genteeleſt Wir, and the moſt ſcurrilous Buffoonery. But by Freedom of Converſation this illiberal Kind of Wit will loſe its Credit.</q>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Bill lately ſaid to be before the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature for encouraging Induſtry (however extraordinary it might be in ſome Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars) was, I do not doubt, extremely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as to its general Purport to a Man of your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. For my Part, I have ever beheld with Pleaſure the Motto, with which a certain eminent Phyſician has long adorned his Chariot, <hi>viz. Non ſibi ſed toti,</hi> and am for promoting Induſtry in a more exalted Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Word, than that in which it is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed; I mean, as it tends to the Good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, without the leaſt Tincture of private Advantage.</p>
                        <p>When very young, I remember to have read in ſome Author, that the <hi>Turks</hi> are obliged to exerciſe ſome Trade or Occupation, which may contribute to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Emolument, and that even their Emperors have no Exemption from this Inſtitution. It is true, a certain Sultan, a Kind of Wag, very artfully evaded the Force of the Law by the following Device. The Muſti, it ſeems, had reproved him for being ſo unmindful of what their Prophet had expreſly enjoined, as to ſpend all his Time in following Hawks and Hounds. The next Morning the wily Sultan ſent his troubleſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor an handſome Preſent of wild Fowl and Veniſon, informing him at the ſame Time, that being convinced of the Juſtneſs of his Reproof, he had in Conſequence thereof taken up the <hi>Trade of a Hunter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Far from approving ſuch a Mahometan Equivocation, I began to conſider wherein I could be of the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0311400901:90"/>Uſe to my Fellow Creatures, without the leaſt Regard to any ſelfiſh Views. I found myſelf in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an ample Patrimony, and conſequently a Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was out of the Queſtion. As to Divinity, Law, the Navy, or Army, I was aware that they carry with them ſome glittering Toy, which more or leſs attracts the Hearts of even the moſt philoſophic of their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. A <hi>Mitre,</hi> for Example, the <hi>Great Seal, a Flag at the Main-top,</hi> or a <hi>Truncheon,</hi> have their reſpective Charms, and no Doubt operate accordingly on the Conduct of their ſeveral Admirers.</p>
                        <p>To all theſe Allurements, I reſolutely ſhut my Eyes, and determined to ſet a noble Example, void of any the leaſt concomitant Self-Intereſt. Thus reſolved to dedicate my Time and Studies to the Service of Man (including Woman) I made Choice of an Occupation of univerſal Conſequence to the World, but of which none, except a few mercenary Pretenders, have ever made public Profeſſion. Not to keep you any longer in Suſpence, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> the Profeſſion I have taken up, and exerciſed for ſome Years, is that of a <hi>Dentifri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi> or what the Vulgar call <hi>a Cleaner of Teeth.</hi> I have heard with Rapture of a certain <hi>Worceſterſhire 'Squire,</hi> who formerly applied himſelf with great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as well as Aſſiduity, to cutting and curing the Corns of all thoſe he could perſuade to make an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of his Skill. Not long ſince a noble Peer was famous for thirſting after a few Ounces of the Blood of all who came near him, not from any Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of Temper, but purely on account of the exquiſite and laudable Pleaſure he took in the Uſe of the Lancet. Even <hi>Peter the Great,</hi> the immortal Refiner of the <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Empire, greatly delighted in drawing the Teeth of every one, who betrayed a Pain in thoſe Parts, by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Handkerchief to his Mouth, by making wry Faces, or any ſuch Indications. Of this I have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0311400901:91"/>by an Eye-witneſs of his Dexterity. To the common Soldiers he gave a Crown for every Tooth he deprived them of, which, indeed, encouraged ſo many poor Wretches, who were ignorant of the Value of their Grinders, to undergo the Operation of an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Hand, that the Officers remonſtrated to his Majeſty, that if he continued to make ſuch Depredations in the Months of the Soldiery, he might disband his Troops, as they would be fit for Service no longer than they could eat.</p>
                        <p>To a Perſen of Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi>'s Sagacity, I need not remark how much my Profeſſion of cleaning, beautify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and preſerving the Teeth, ſurpaſſes the inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Zeal of that great Man. Every one is ſenſible how much we ſurpaſs all other Nations in the Bravery of our Soldiers, and the Dexterity as well as Intrepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of our Mariners; and yet it is well known, that all this depends on eating, and, of courſe, on the Goodneſs of their Teeth. And as to our Beaux and Belles, how much the Force of their Charms is aſſiſted by a delicate Set of Teeth, is a Truth ſo evident in itſelf, as not to need the leaſt Demonſtration.</p>
                        <p>In Conſequence of theſe Reflexions, I applied my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſtudy every Author who has wrote on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. I went ſo far as to take an <hi>Arabian</hi> into my Houſe to inſtruct me in his Language, that I might be able to conſult the Writers of his Country in the Original, as well as the Authors of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> After this I travelled over all <hi>Europe</hi> to converſe with ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this noble and delectable Operation. I have even put myſelf in their Hands, in order to acquire every Excellence, as well as avoid every Defect incidental to my brother Operators.</p>
                        <p>Some Time ſince, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> you favoured us with an Account of the Progreſs you had made in Phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy. You therefore will eaſily believe what I am
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0311400901:92"/>going to relate of my own Sagacity. By a curious and exact Obſervation of the various Marks on the Teeth in different Perſons, from the continual Friction they undergo, as well from each other as from the Tongue and Lips, I am able to diſcover what Paſſions their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Owners are ſubject to, and how far they indulge them, particularly as to <hi>Anger, Envy,</hi> or <hi>Love.</hi> It's an old Remark, that Proverbs are a Kind of Teſt of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Wiſdom, and are either literally or allegorically founded on Truths of no ſmall Importance. Now, I need only inſtance a few of theſe pithy Sentences, to convince the moſt Incredulous what great Diſcoveries may be made by a ſkilful Contemplator in this Way. As for Inſtance, <hi>Such a one has all his Eye-Teeth;— He ſhews his Teeth, but cannot bite;—A third has a ſoft Tooth in his Head;—This good Lady has a Colt's Tooth left yet;—Another has a liquoriſh Tooth,</hi> &amp;c. I have made many Obſervations of this Nature, and even at firſt Sight, I can diſcover whether a certain Mark be out of a young Lady's Mouth or not; in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whether ſhe be in a State of pure Virginity, or has really given it up; or in what Degree of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhe is of ſo doing, by the Indications her Teeth contract from being frequently applied to the Sheets or Pillows. In ſome I have diſcovered, after their having been in Company with two Siſter-Graces, (a certain Dutcheſs and Counteſs that ſhall be nameleſs,) whether their Teeth have been affected by the corroſive Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ariſing from Envy, or brightened by the Motion of the Lips, occaſioned by the Smiles of a pleaſing Admiration.</p>
                        <p>I have already taken up too much of your Time, and therefore decline giving you an Account of my Travels (for the narrow Conſiderations of Wife or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily cannot long detain me at Home) in Search of all Opportunities of improving myſelf in the Art of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0311400901:93"/>and beautifying, thoſe uſeful Implements the Teeth. It is true, I was lately very near aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning my Profeſſion, through the Treatment I met with from a certain great Prince in <hi>Germany,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to want my Aſſiſtance, no ſooner got my Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in his Mouth, than, cloſing his Foreteeth, he held me faſt in the greateſt Pain imaginable; and at the ſame Time he ſpoiled, with one of his Grinders, the niceſt Pair of Ruffles, which I had made up at <hi>Verſailles</hi> on Occaſion of the Rejoicings for the Birth of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN an Author firſt launches forth, a pleaſing Proſpect lies before him; his Spirits are enlivened with the Novelty of his Enterprize; his Imagination pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to him Scenes of Succeſs, and he thinks he has nothing to do, but to ſpread all his Sails, and glide away to the Realms of Fame. Were an Inſurance-Office opened for Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers of this Nature, where, for a ſmall Premium, the Event might be aſcertained, he would hardly think it worth his while to intrench himſelf within thoſe Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards; ſo ſure is he of reaching his wiſhed for Haven. But how ſorn is the flattering Dream diſſipated into Air! Like <hi>Virgil's Aeneas,</hi> he no ſooner leaves the Shore, and ſees the Land gradually leſſening to his Eye, than he finds himſelf embarked on a Sea of Troubles. Some ſecret Enemy, in whoſe Breaſt an unjuſt Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice has long been rankling, immediately begins to counterwork his Progreſs, and a Storm is raiſed againſt him. Calumny, Detraction, Scandal, and Malevolence blow a more violent Tempeſt, than the four Winds combined; the piercing Blaſts of Enmity whiſtle round him, and his little Bark becomes the Sport of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Element; now elevated as high as the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and then at once let down to the profoundeſt Bottom of the Deep. Should he be hardy enough to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0311400901:96"/>think of weathering it out, he is beſet by a Shoal of Monſters, known in thoſe Seas by the Name of CRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICKS. Theſe dangerous Animals of Prey are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly prowling about the Main, upon the Look-out, if I may be allowed the Expreſſion, for ſome Object of their Rage. Him they inſtantly ſurround, and all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to amuſe them from their fell Purpoſe are in vain; Tubs have been thrown to Whales with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and we have read of <hi>Arion,</hi> who found Means, by the lenient Airs of his Harp, to ſoften into Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Group of Monſters, hungry, and ready to devour him; but no Perſuaſive is ſufficient to appeaſe the Rage of the CRITICKS, mentioned above; almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Ruin attends the Man, who unhappily falls in their Way; and if, by the Light of ſome propitious Star, he ſhould ſteer his Courſe clear of them, they have been ſeen to goad and bite themſelves with Spite and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation.</p>
                  <p>To deſcend from this long continued Allegory: A public Writer, who undertakes to inſtruct or entertain his Readers, has ſo many Difficulties to cope with, that inſtead of wondering at the Dearth of good Papers of late, I am ſurprized that any Advances are made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. The <hi>Pangs of deſpiſed Wit</hi> are, perhaps, equal to <hi>thoſe of deſpiſed Love,</hi> and one would imagine them ſufficient to extinguiſh an Author's honeſt Emulation, and to determine him to think a Poſt of inglorious Eaſe more eligible than that State of Warfare, he muſt be involved in as a Writer. It is to no purpoſe to plead in Bar to the Invectives of the rigid Cenſors of the Age, a well-meant Endeavour to promote Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Good-humour: An Acquaintance of mine, who delights in parodying Paſſages from Poets, ſays, with ſome Pleaſantry, <hi>Criticks have flinty Hearts; na Wit can move them; Authors muſt be unhappy.</hi>

                  <p>ILL-NATURE is the Founder of the Family; in a Fit of petulant Delight this Perſonage was joined in Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock to the celebrated Dame, IGNORANCE, The Iſſue of this happy Marriage was ENVY, who, being of a conſumptive Habit of Body, and no very amorous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, was deterred for a long Time from any Thoughts of Matrimony; but at length meeting with MALICE, he took an immediate Fancy to her, and by a Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Soul this lovely Pair were led to a mutual Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for each other. MALICE was an old Maid, of a lean ſhrivelled Habit of Body, and delighted greatly in Tea-table Chat. At firſt the Relations of ENVY were diſguſted at the Match, as they imagined from the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Looks, that there was not any probable Likelihood of their having Iſſue, by which it was apprehended the Family would be totally extinct. But Things are not always to be taken by Appearances; though the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married Couple lived together like Cats, conſtantly ſcratching and quarrelling, they ſtill found ſofter Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Dalliance, and in about nine Months, CRITI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISM was uſhered into the World. The Tidings of this happy Occurrence were ſoon wafted towards <hi>Grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet College;</hi> Mother DULNESS raiſed her drowſy Head, pleaſed with the Account of the ſprightly Dunce, and all her Votaries hailed the new-born Babe. In <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus</hi> the Effect was far different; <hi>Apollo</hi> ſtarted, and each amiable MUSE let fall a tender Tear: The tune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lyre was laid aſide, and ASTRAEA dropped her Scales.</p>

                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0311400901:98"/>That the Lineage of this egregious Youth may be carried in the Mind with more Facility, I ſhall here throw the whole Pedigree in one View before the Eye of the Reader.</p>

                  <p>ENVY—MALICE</p>
                  <p>CRITICISM.</p>
                  <p>Like <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, the Infant was born with Teeth, and the Moment it perceived the firſt Ray of Light, it began to hiſs. Several of the uſual Play-things given to Children were immediately bought, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could allay our young Hero's Cries, until a Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call was given into his Hands, of which, by a Kind of Inſtinct, he inſtantly found the Uſe, and he ſeemed to take a malicious Pleaſure at the Shrilneſs of the Sound. In proceſs of Time an Horn-book was procured for the young Gentleman, and at the firſt Sight of it he grew extremely peeviſh, and ſhortly after began to pull it to pieces. In this he was encouraged by his <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother,</hi> who alledged it would ſpoil the Child's Eyes, but it is confidently ſaid that he at laſt took to it of himſelf, but that he applied at random, in a very irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Manner; and I am credibly informed, that he could not be induced to purſue the Alphabet in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Order, but that the firſt Letters he became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, were <hi>D, A, M, N.</hi> It is a Queſtion with many, whether he ever went further; but after ſome Pains in the Reſearch, I have found from ſome ſecret Memoirs, that he really did learn to read the Title-Pages of Books and Pamphlets, in order the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to abuſe them.</p>
                  <p>Our Youth in his Countenance had a blended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to his Parents, with a very great Air of his Grandmother. From his <hi>Grandſire</hi> he derived a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all Kinds of Vice, and therefore the evil
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0311400901:99"/>Qualities of his Father thrived in a Soil admirably fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their Reception. Pleaſure he was an utter Stranger to, unleſs the Misfortunes of his Neighbours excited the mixed Senſations of that malignant Joy mentioned by <hi>Ovid.</hi>

                  <p>Nothing could ever rouze him to an Emulation of others, whom he perceived to excel, but he ſat pining and ſelf-tormented at the Idea of their Merit, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Volubility of Speech from his Mother, he vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Spleen in Obloquy and ſcandalous Invective. In theſe Qualities he made great Improvement, and each Day added ſome new Accompliſhment, ſuch as <hi>Impudence, Pertneſs, Ill-manners,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Being now arrived at Maturity, he grew wondrous fond of Coffee-houſes, and turned out a complete <hi>Blood.</hi> He was conſtantly ſeen poring over the <hi>Magazines,</hi> and if he ever met with a Production of Genius, he ſhewed great Perturbation of Mind, and was often heard to pronounce with ſome Vehemence;—<hi>Piſh!—Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable!—Damnea Stuff!—O G—d!</hi>—He went to the Playhouſe on the firſt Night of every new Piece; the Players dreaded the Sight of him in the Pit; there he talked of Actors whom he never ſaw; retailed Authors whom he never read; tore up Benches; grinned and chattered; hiſſed and clapped; yawned and ſlept. Having heard that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Art of Poetry was eſteemed among his beſt Performances, he bought at a Stall a certain curious Production entitled <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Maſter-piece,</hi> which gave him a mean Opinion of the Ancients; and thence he took Occaſion to ridicule all Kind of Learning, and became a Delegate, of his own Choice, to direct the Taſte of the Age; and if a young Author ſhewed any Traces of Elegance in a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, or diſcovered a Vein of Thinking, capable of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0311400901:100"/>further Improvements, he endeavoured to nip him in the Bud.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; CRITICISM has been upon Town for ſeveral Years, and ſtill continues in the Practice of every bad Quality, deducible from a weak Head and a corrupt Heart; but as I intend to perſevere in the Work I have undertaken, I will cut Matters ſhort, and inform this Gentleman, and all his Followers, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this I ſhall not ſuffer myſelf to be diverted from the Drift of this Deſign. I think I ſhall be able to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſome Compoſitions, not quite unworthy of the public Peruſal; and if I do not point out any unknown Truths, I ſhall endeavour to place every Thing in a Point of View, that, I hope, will ſometimes give it the Graces of Novelty.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall continue to prefix a Motto to each Lucubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſome celebrated Author of Antiquity, and this not out of any Affectation, but becauſe from an early Taſte for thoſe excellent Writers, many of their Beauties have inſinuated themſelves into my Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſo lively a Manner, that they recur on almoſt every Topic. This ſerves very often with the Claſſic Scholar, to place an entire Eſſay before his Eye at once; and to ſee a fine Paſſage ſtart into a new Light, and carry a witty Alluſion to a Subject, in Appearance foreign to it, muſt, in my Opinion, excite agreeable Ideas in the Fancy.</p>
                  <p>The mere <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader will loſe this Pleaſure, but the reſt of this Paper cannot ſuffer by it.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>I HAVE been in this ſtrange Place about ſix Weeks, and find myſelf in ſuch a whimſical Situation, that I may truly ſay, with <hi>Petulant,</hi> in the <hi>Way of the World, I am like a Dog in a Dancing-School.</hi> Upon our firſt Arrival here, we took a <hi>Fiacre,</hi> and drove to our Banker, who lives up four Pair of Stairs. As he was our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, we thought him the moſt proper Perſon to direct us, and accordingly enquired whether there were any good Lodgings to be let in the <hi>Rue de</hi>
                           <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0311400901:103"/>
                           <hi>Boncherie;</hi> for you muſt know, <hi>Harry,</hi> we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, before we left <hi>England,</hi> by ſome Gentlemen, who ſaid they knew <hi>Paris</hi> very well, that we ſhould take up our Reſidence in that Part of the Town. — But the Banker ſmiled at the Queſtion, and told us, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen had deſerted that famous Street ever ſince the <hi>Harlequin</hi> at the <hi>Italian</hi> Comedy, in making Love to his Miſtreſs, told her, among other Profeſſions of his Paſſion, <hi>that he loved her as violently as my Lord</hi> Anglois <hi>did the</hi> Rue de Boucherie. He added, that he would take care to fix us in a proper Lodging, and conducted us to <hi>Peyri Bagneur,</hi> in the <hi>Rue Dauphine,</hi> who accommodated us with a very good Apartment. Our next Care was to equip ourſelves in the Faſhion of the Country. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we ſent for a Taylor, and <hi>Jack Commons,</hi> who jabbers a little <hi>French,</hi> directed him to make us two Suits; which he brought us the next Morning at Ten o'Clock, and made compleat <hi>Frenchmen</hi> of us. But for my part, <hi>Harry,</hi> I was ſo damned uneaſy in a full-dreſſed Coat, with helliſh long Skirts, which I had never been uſed to, that I thought myſelf as much deprived of my Liberty, as if I had been in the <hi>Baſtile;</hi> and I frequently ſighed for my little looſe Frock, which I look upon as an Emblem of our happy Conſtitution; for it lays a Man under no uneaſy Reſtraint, but leaves it in his Power to do as he pleaſes. I muſt not forget to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that we hired a <hi>Swiſs</hi> Servant, whom they call here <hi>Valet de Place;</hi> and to him we entruſted the Management of every Thing, which ſaves us a great deal of Trouble; and I really believe the Fellow to be extremely honeſt, for I do not find that I ſpend more Money here than in <hi>London.</hi> As it is abſolutely neceſſary to have a Coach in <hi>Paris,</hi> we engaged a <hi>Remiſe</hi> during our Stay; and indeed it was indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0311400901:104"/>incumbent upon us to ſet up an Equipage, for we commenced Lords immediately upon entering the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> St. <hi>Germain.</hi>—Z—ds, <hi>Harry,</hi> theſe People think, that every Man who looks aukward, and throws away his Money, is an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lord; nay, they are ſo liberal of this Title, that they call the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Taylors and Peruke-makers, who ſometimes pay them a Viſit, <hi>des petits my Lords.</hi> You may believe, my Friend, I was very deſirous to ſee their Theatrical Entertainments. — I have indeed been at one or other of them every Night. They are d— ſtrange, Sir, — Not the Thing, by any Means. — I do not, it is true, underſtand the Language, but their Manner is quite different from ours.—The Players ſeldom or ever throw out the Voice with any Vehemence, but ſpeak in as natural a Manner, as if they were off the Stage — That would not be borne with us. You know, however, the <hi>French</hi> are pleaſed with it, as they know no better. The firſt Time I was at the Play-houſe, I imagined there had been a Riot the Night before; for I obſerved there were no Benches in the Pit: But, in this I was miſtaken, for there never are any Seats in that Part of the Houſe; the Reaſon is, I ſuppoſe, becauſe a <hi>Frenchman</hi> could not ſit ſtill during the Performance. With Reſpect to the Manner of living, <hi>Harry,</hi> it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. By Heavens! I ſhould have been ſtarved, if I had not luckily got acquainted with an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Abbe of <hi>Lombard College,</hi> one Mr. <hi>M' Manus,</hi> a very good Sort of a Man, though a Popiſh Prieſt. He has a curſed queer Way of talking indeed, his Accent being a Mixture of the Brogue and the <hi>French</hi> Cadence, and his Phraſes generally literal Tranſlations from the <hi>French.</hi> He is notwithſtanding a d—d honeſt Fellow, and will get drunk with any of his Friends at a Minute's Warning. If it had not been for this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who conducted me to a little Place, kept by
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0311400901:105"/>one <hi>Kemp,</hi> where I got a Leg of Mutton and Turnips, and Beef-ſtakes, I ſhould have been obliged to ſet out Poſt for <hi>England.</hi> — 'Tis true, upon Honour — My Life was at Stake — I could by no Means live upon their <hi>Soup and Bully,</hi> and footy Kickſhaws made of ſtinking Meat. Their Wines, it muſt be allowed, are pretty enough, when one is uſed to them; but at firſt they ſeem prodigious weak: They have not half the Body of our Wines in <hi>England:</hi> But, that is eaſily accounted for, the beſt Growths being always ſent to us; at leaſt <hi>Venables</hi> and <hi>Tomkins</hi> tell me ſo. In mentioning <hi>Kemp</hi>'s, I ſhould have told you of an ugly Scrape I had like to have fallen into. I got into Company with an Officer of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Troops in the <hi>French</hi> King's Service, and I began to hum him about Party Affairs; but, d—n me, he ſoon gave me to underſtand that I was on the wrong Side the Water for that Fun, and inſiſted, that I ſhould give imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Satisfaction. Gad, I reflected it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundedly ſilly, to get pinked in a Popiſh Country, where they would not allow me a Chriſtian Burial; and ſo I aſked his Pardon, and the Affair was made up, by the Mediation of Abbé <hi>M Manus.</hi> This has cured me from attempting any Sport of that Kind while I ſtay here. You will be ſurprized, perhaps, that I give you no Account of the People. To tell you the Truth, my Friend, I do not know any of them. I went once to an Ordinary, and the Company were ſo remarkably civil to me, that I began to think they had a Deſign upon me; but my Friend, <hi>Jack Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> who has ſtudied the Law, and knows theſe Things, tells me, this exceſſive Politeneſs proceeds from their living under an arbitrary Government. I cannot help laughing at the immenſe Number of <hi>Chevaliers de St. Louis,</hi> which I meet every where. Theſe Gentlemen are as numerous here, as Knights
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0311400901:106"/>have been in the City of <hi>London,</hi> ſince the Year Forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>three. They wear a little enamelled Croſs hanging to a red Ribbon, which is fixed in a Button hole of the Coat; and moſt of them have a Streak of Dirt on their white Silk-Stockings, about an Inch above the Shoe, which, I ſuppoſe, is Part of the Order. As to the Government of this Country, I have not thought it worth my while to enquire about it, for I am ſatisfied with old <hi>England,</hi> and there will end my Days. I have had very few Amours ſince I left <hi>England,</hi> for I do not know how it is, I am d—d ſhy of the Women here, they are ſo deviliſh ſprightly—I know three or four of them, whom my Barber recommended me to, but they are not of the firſt Claſs.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, dear <hi>Harry,</hi> Mr. <hi>M'Manus</hi> has carried me through all the Curioſities in and about <hi>Paris,</hi> and now my Time lies very heavy on my Hands; for as I have no Acquaintance, and am unwilling to enter into any Connexion with People in a ſtrange Country, I am at a Loſs what to do with myſelf in an Evening. The Day I contrive to paſs away tolerably, in ſaunter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Tuilleries</hi> until Dinner, which brings all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> together at <hi>Kemp</hi>'s; from thence we adjourn to <hi>Procope</hi>'s, until it is Time to go to the Play, which kills the Time to about half an Hour after Eight; but when the Actors diſmiſs us, we are perplexed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how we ſhall diſpoſe of ourſelves, and are, in the End, obliged, in our own Defence, to return to <hi>Kemp</hi>'s, and play a Game at Whiſt. This Way of Life will not do with me, and in about a Fortnight you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſee me, when we will laugh over theſe ſtrange Scenes at the <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Club, of which I am a Member, and of which I have already given ſome Account in this Paper, is not a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy in Riot and Debauchery, but was inſtituted with a View of enjoying a pleaſing Converſe, rather than of contending with each other for the Renown of the moſt potent Conſtitution, or the moſt capacious Swallow. Accordingly our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe generally turns upon ſome Topic, that may ſerve to diſcloſe the Humours of Mankind, or carry our Taſte to a greater Degree of Refinement in the polite Arts.</p>
                  <p>An Evening of this ſort I was ſure to enjoy at our laſt Meeting, as the Chair was to be filled by Mr. <hi>Candid,</hi> whom I have formerly deſcribed as a very odd Critic, good Nature and Knowledge being Peculiarities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in his Character. As ſoon as the mutual Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities were exchanged between the Company, this Gentleman acquainted us with an Occurrence, which is really of a very extraordinary Nature. As he was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Piazzas</hi> at <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> he perceived a Man extremely buſy in paſting up againſt the Walls, Advertiſements of ſo ſingular a Furport, that he was
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0311400901:110"/>induced to beg one of them, which was read out to the Club, and was in Subſtance as follows:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Lately launched at <hi>Deptford,</hi> a Ship called the <hi>Pantomime,</hi> now lying at <hi>Iron-gate,</hi> whereof is Owner <hi>John Lun,</hi> Burthen ſeven hundred Tons, mounts four and thirty Guns, and bound directly for the <hi>South-Seas,</hi> in queſt of Monſters of all Sorts; to cruize for ſome Time in thoſe Parts, and thence to bear away to the unknown World, to touch upon the Coaſts of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and return home North about, in order to ſtock our Theatres with the wildeſt Exotics that can be met with. Good Encouragement will be given to all Seafaring Men, who will ſhip themſelves on board the <hi>Pantomime</hi> above mentioned; and, as a Corps of Marines will be requiſite, diſappointed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-Hunters, broken Gameſters, Hen-peck'd Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Under-actors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be received, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Commiſſion forthwith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>N. B.</hi> Apply to any of the Brokers on Change, at <hi>Sam</hi>'s Coffee houſe, <hi>George</hi>'s <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> the <hi>Bedford,</hi> or the Stage-Door of the Theatre in <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This Piece of Intelligence gave no ſmall Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the reſt of the Company; but our Chairman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, he had ſeen ſo many ſtrange Turns in Life, that he did not doubt but it would be abſolutely carried into Execution; and added, that it would certainly draw prodigious Houſes, to have it mentioned in the Play-Bills, that the principal Parts, in a new Entertainment, will be performed by a wonderful <hi>Armadillo</hi> from <hi>Braſil,</hi> a <hi>Serpent</hi> from the River <hi>Oronoque,</hi> the famous <hi>Lanthorn-Fly</hi> from <hi>Peru,</hi> a <hi>Mermaid</hi> from the <hi>Ladrones Iſlands,</hi> a ſurpriſing <hi>Camel,</hi> a <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> and many horrible Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, <hi>being their firſt Appearance on the Engliſh Stage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Candid</hi> proceeded to obſerve, that <hi>poor Shakeſpear,</hi> who uſed to flouriſh, like the Thorn at <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0311400901:111"/>the Depth of Winter, muſt now entirely be deſtroyed but however, to prevent, as far as in him lay, this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Miſchief, he informed us, that he has drawn up, with no ſmall Pains, a Pamphlet entitled, <hi>A modeſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal againſt aboliſhing Nature, and</hi> Shakeſpear, <hi>at this Juncture,</hi> addreſſed to <hi>David Garrick,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> with whom he hoped it would have due Weight, as all his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances have diſplayed a true Reliſh for our great Poet's maſterly Touches, and as the Courſe of his Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has proved him to be a cordial Friend to Genius and Letters.</p>
                  <p>"And now, ſince I have mentioned Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi>" continued he, <q>I had rather ſee him come out from the Murder of <hi>Duncan</hi> in the Character of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> with the Daggers in his Hands, than behold a Fountain of Tin, playing in Jetteaus, a real Caſcade, or a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-dance by all the Monſters of the Creation.—I may be out in my Taſte, but, there are Touches of Nature in the Play juſt mentioned, which I ſhall always reflect upon with Pleaſure; though I cannot help wondering, that <hi>Garrick,</hi> who always ſtrikes out the brighteſt Ideas, ſhould attach himſelf to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reading of a Line in the Part of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> when ſo noble a Meaning is to be extracted from the ſame Paſſage. The Thing, I mean, is, when he looks at his Hands, and breaks out into the following Speech.
<q>
                           <l>With all great <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Ocean waſh this Blood</l>
                           <l>Clean from my Hand? No;—this my Hand will rather</l>
                           <l>The multitudinous Sea incarnadine,</l>
                           <l>Making the Green one Red.</l>
                        </q>
The laſt Line is generally pronounced, as if <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> meant, the GREEN-ONE, which, after the pompous Expreſſion of the <hi>Multitudinous Sea,</hi> would render it liable to the Imputation of an Anticlimax; whereas,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0311400901:112"/>if it is underſtood, as <hi>making the Green,</hi>—ONE RED, i. e. the Colour of the Sea, which is of itſelf green, <hi>one intire univerſal Red,</hi> it would cloſe the Paſſage with a Dignity reſponſive to what precedes, and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the Vaſtneſs of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Conception, as it not only keeps up the Image impreſſed upon the Mind, by the Term MULTITUDINOUS Sea, but alſo height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Horror of <hi>Macbeth</hi>'s Crime; the Blood he has ſpilt being ſufficient to convert the natural Colour of the whole Ocean into—ONE RED.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Interpretation may, perhaps, not appear <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> to thoſe who are bigotted to <hi>Play-houſe Tradition;</hi> but by our whole Club it was thought extremely juſt, and Mr. <hi>Plaſtick,</hi> the <hi>Shaftſburian</hi> Philoſopher, received it with an Air of Enthuſiaſm; declaring, that it ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted an Idea, which expanded the Imagination, the more it dwelt upon it. After this, he offered ſome Doubts, which aroſe in his Mind, concerning a Paſſage in the ſame Play, of which he conceived the Meaning, though he did not ſee the Propriety and Conſiſtence of the Figures. The Lines hinted at are in <hi>Macbeth</hi>'s Soliloquy concerning the Deed he was to perpetrate.
<q>
                        <l>— I have no Spur</l>
                        <l>To prick the Sides of my Intent, but only</l>
                        <l>Vaulting Ambition, which o'er-leaps itſelf,</l>
                        <l>And falls on th' other.—</l>
                     </q> Mr. <hi>Candid</hi> immediately reaſſumed the Diſcourſe. <q>The firſt Thing to be obſerved, ſaid he, is the Rapidity of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Imagination, and the quick Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Ideas, which it ſupplied him with. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical Expreſſion in the Verſe,—<hi>I have no Spur to prick the Sides of my Intent,</hi>—gave Occaſion to the Figure following, in the ſucceeding Line—<hi>But</hi>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0311400901:113"/>VAULTING AMBITION, <hi>which o'er-leaps itſelf, and falls on th' other.</hi>—The Alluſion is to a <hi>managed Horſe,</hi> and AMBITION is repreſented as a Perſon, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to vault into the Seat, by the Violence of his Effort, overleaps himſelf, and falls quite on the other Side.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Shaftſburian</hi> returned Thanks for the Light thrown upon this Place, and obſerved, that the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation is perfectly applicable to the Circumſtances and Conduct of <hi>Macbeth;</hi> when Mr. <hi>Allcaſh,</hi> the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, interpoſed, and told us, that, for his Part, he did not mind your Plays much,—that he went to ſee <hi>Garrick</hi> at <hi>Goodman</hi>'s-<hi>Fields,</hi> and could not help laughing to ſee the People cry at <hi>King Lear,</hi> when he knew it was all a Play, and paid his Money for it. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to ruffle the Temper of Mr. <hi>Plaſtick,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly harangued upon the <hi>Public Senſe,</hi> the <hi>Moral Senſe,</hi> and the <hi>Internal Senſe;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Allcaſh</hi> was not to be beat out of his Way, and, inſtead of paying any Deference to this Doctrine, he deſired an Explanation of a Line in <hi>Othello,</hi> where <hi>Iago</hi> ſays, <hi>Who ſteals my Purſe ſteals 'Traſh, 'tis ſomething, nothing.</hi> 
                     <q>Is there not, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> ſome Miſtake, in calling Money <hi>Traſh,</hi> and <hi>ſomething nothing?</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chairman ſmiled at this Obſervation, which he promiſed to conſider at his Leiſure, and for the preſent, proceeded to give a Correction of a Miſtake in <hi>Othello,</hi> in the fifth Act of which <hi>Iago</hi> ſays to <hi>Roderigo,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>I have rubb'd this <hi>Gnat</hi> almoſt to the Senſe,</l>
                        <l>And he grows angry.</l>
                     </q> The common Editions give us the Lines in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Mr. <hi>Warburton</hi> has done the ſame. <hi>Theobald</hi> is the only Editor who ſaw the Abſurdity. <hi>To rub a</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0311400901:114"/>
                     <hi>Gnat,</hi> as he obſerves, though ever ſo gently, would rub it out of all Senſe, and would effectually kill it. Yet, though he perceived the Error, it ſeems, he knew not how to mend it. The Quarto Editions, Mr. <hi>Candid,</hi> told us, inſtead of <hi>Gnat,</hi> read <hi>Quat,</hi> or <hi>Quot;</hi> 
                     <q>but <hi>Theobald,</hi> continued he, not knowing the Meaning of the Word, alters it to <hi>Knot,</hi> the Name of a Bird, and has a long Note to juſtify the Correction. But the old Books are perfectly right, a <hi>Quat,</hi> or <hi>Quot,</hi> being a ſmall Heat or Pimple, which, by itching, provokes us to ſcratch it, and when rubbed to the Quick or Senſe, it becomes hot and angry. The Word has not perhaps the Authority of any contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Writer, but muſt certainly be <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s, as it is ſtill uſed in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> the native Country of the old Bard; and in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> where I paſſed a good many Months, a few Years ſince, it ſtill carries with it the Meaning already aſſigned to it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Chairman ceaſed here, and I apprehend, that the communicating this Remark will be agreeable to all the Admirers of <hi>Shakeſpear;</hi> and I am apt to think, that many Paſſages of the Poet, ſeemingly corrupted, are to be illuſtrated, not from Books, but from the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and Dialect of the People; many of the Terms, which appear quite antiquated and obſolete, being, as I am informed, ſtill uſed in the Northern Parts of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Our Reſearches into Literature ended here, and the Company immediately withdrew, like ſatisfied Gueſts. If my Readers ſhould riſe from the Peruſal of this Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubration with the ſame Reliſh, I ſhall have gained the End propoſed by this Account of our Tranſactions.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lucubration of laſt <hi>Saturday</hi> contained an Account of the Tranſactions of our Club; and as an Incident offered, after it broke up, which gave Riſe to the Speculation of this Day, I beg that this Paper may be received as a Sequel to it.</p>
                  <p>The Majority of our worthy Members returned home, rather ſooner than is uſual with them; at length, Mr. <hi>Candid</hi> and myſelf were the only Two remaining. As we drew nearer to the Fire, and to each other, our Hearts began to throw off all Reſerve; and the <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> which before was vague and upon general To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks of Literature, became gradually more confined, and at length it centered wholly on ourſelves. Mr. <hi>Candid,</hi> amongſt other Particulars, began to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with me on my Addreſs and Reputation as a Writer, and the Credit he was pleaſed to ſay I had acquired, in conducting the Paper which bears my Name. Your Reputation, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> ſays he, is at preſent in its early Bloom; the Aſpect of the Public ſhines on you, with a cheering Influence and Warmth. But you are not to imagine, it will be always thus. The Sky may be overcaſt, and the enlivening Radiance intercepted; a chilling Froſt may unexpectedly ſucceed, and nip all your Bloſſoms in the Bud. To drop the Metaphor,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0311400901:117"/>continued he, the Countenance and Encouragement of the Public may be withdrawn, and at a Time when you are exerting all your Talents to deſerve and ſecure it. Popular Favour, and popular Prejudice, are the moſt capricious Things imaginable. Diſguſt will often ariſe, where no Satiety has been given; and mutual Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and good Liking will unaccountably degenerate to Coldneſs, Suſpicion, and Indifference. Yet, it may be difficult to ſay, from whence this Alteration is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned; or, whether it is owing to the Pretenſions of the Writer, or the Reader; but in this Caſe perhaps, as in moſt others, there may be Faults on both Sides. Exorbitant Claims are not ſo eaſily adjuſted; eſpecially where the Parties are equally unwilling to recede from their preſumptive Rights. The Author is often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable in his Demands for Fame; and the Public as hard to be gratified in their Expectation of Pleaſure. You are, at preſent, conſidered as a new Writer; the Delicacies you regale the Town with, are a Diſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of by your Fellow-Caterers for the general En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. But theſe in Time will become familiar to our Taſte; your Wit will then be cenſured to have loſt its Poignancy, and your Humour its Reliſh. I was going to make a ſuitable Reply to ſo obliging an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium, when my Friend prevented me, by obſerving that the Evening was now far advanced; and that it became us, as <hi>Originals,</hi> not to prolong our Compota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the modern Midnight Hours of Converſation.</p>
                  <p>In retiring to my Chambers, I could not forbear ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating on the Sentiments of my penetrating Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; and reſolved to throw together a few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon what may be term'd <hi>Novelty</hi> in Writing.</p>
                  <p>I think then that judicious Imitation either of antient or modern Standards ought not to be ſtigmatiſed as Larceny in an Author. He is certainly at Liberty to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0311400901:118"/>draw from any excellent Model, whom he chuſes to copy; and that without incurring the ignominious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations of a Plagiary or Tranſcriber. Univerſal Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom will juſtify the Practice. All the imitative Arts may be more particularly termed ſo, as the ſeveral Maſters have frequently work'd after a Plan, that was firſt ſketched out by ſome eminent Example. The ſame Deſign, diverſified indeed with newer Decorations, as Genius or Invention prompted, may be traced in the different Performances of ſubſequent Artiſts; ſometimes extended by the Addition of Circumſtances, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally grew out of the Work; or contracted, by pruning the luxuriant Branches, and retrenching what appeared ſuperfluous and unneceſſary.</p>
                  <p>This general and diſtant Imitation, it will be readily owned, is allowable and juſt; is what cannot perhaps be eaſily avoided, where the Subject is treated with Propriety, and according to the Rules of Art. Thus <hi>Virgil</hi> followed <hi>Homer;</hi> thus <hi>Addiſon</hi> will always be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as the Pattern either of grave, or of humourous Speculation; and <hi>Fielding</hi> will ever be a faithful Guide to the Adventurer in comic Romance.</p>
                  <p>But there is another Kind of Imitation, which is more direct and literal; and which conſiſts in adopting the Sentiments and Phraſe of others. Of this the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality is yet a Queſtion, and the Practice is generally judged to denote Poverty of Thought, and Defect of Imagination in the Writer. The Cenſure is perhaps too rigid, or at leaſt may be moderated by ſome qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying Conſiderations that ſuggeſt themſelves to our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Attention.</p>
                  <p>The Tranſfuſion of Wit, from one Language to another, when done with Elegance and Eaſe, has been ſeldom turned to the Diſparagement of the Author who has Abilities to do it, when the Spirit is not ſuffered
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0311400901:119"/>to evaporate, but retains all the Sprightlineſs and Vigour which it poſſeſs'd in the Original. The Sentence which I have placed at the Head of this Paper is an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to an Author, either for reviving obſolete and antiquated Expreſſions, or for the Importation of new ones, if the Liberty be uſed with Modeſty and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What <hi>Horace</hi> has thus obſerved with regard to Words only, may be Parity of Reaſon be applied to Sentiment and Thought.</p>
                  <p>If the Language is enriched by the Addition of a ſingle Term or Phraſe, our Stock of Knowledge is made ſtill more exuberant, by introducing a Succeſſion of new Ideas; in Proportion as the Value of an Ingot is ſuperior to a ſingle Coin. To diſcover a new uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vein of Thinking upon ordinary and beaten To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics, requires that creative Power of Imagination, which Nature has imparted only to her Favourites, and with a frugal ſparing Hand. Authors of inferior Genius have eaſier Methods aſſigned them in their Purſuit of Fame. It muſt be their Merit to ſelect the moſt agreeable and pleaſing Imagery, to give delicate and graceful Turns to obvious and common Thoughts; and by this Means to recommend what is grown familiar to our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, by the Novelty and Advantage of its Dreſs. A Statue which we have ceaſed to look on with the Eyes of Admiration, when removed to another Point of View, ſhall ſtrike us with freſh Pleaſure and Delight; a Pleaſure which reſults entirely from the Novelty and Change of its Poſition.</p>
                  <p>There is a Couplet in <hi>Pope,</hi> which I beg Leave to produce, as applicable to the Sentiments advanced.
<q>
                        <l>True Wit is Nature to Advantage dreſs'd,</l>
                        <l>What oft was thought, but ne'er ſo well expreſs'd.</l>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0311400901:120"/>And this very Sentiment, which I mention only as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the Subject, and which, on any other Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I ſhould have induſtriouſly concealed, our inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Poet has taken from a Remark of <hi>Boileau.</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who argue with Preciſion will often unavoidably fall into a Coincidence of Thought: Nature and Truth are invariable; and when ſeveral Pictures are taken of the ſame Object, if they are juſt Copies of the Original, they will neceſſarily have a Likeneſs to each other. I might add likewiſe, how difficult it is to offer what has not yet been ſaid by any one, on Subjects that appear exhauſted.</p>
                  <p>An humourous Acquaintance, who often talks to me on this head, lays it down as an indiſputable Principle, that Compoſition is only the Art of Stealing wiſely: And indeed, as Matters are uſually managed by our worthy Fraternity of Authors, if we ſtrike out the laſt Word, his Definition is perfectly unexceptionable. I make then no Scruple to declare, that I look on all the Wit, and all the Humour in antient or modern Languages, as good and lawful Prize; and that I ſhall freely convert them to my own Uſe, and the Public Emolument: But then I will take care to do it in ſuch a Manner as ſhall reflect no Diſgrace to the Author from whom I borrow it; and that, if he comes at any Time either in Perſon, or by his Attorney, to demand his Property, he ſhall find it employed in the very Way which he himſelf would chuſe.</p>
                  <p>Having ſaid this, I give public Notice of this my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to Mr. <hi>Town</hi> and all his Adherents, and I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them withal to keep a good Look-out, in order to detect and expoſe me.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE my firſt entering upon the Province of a periodical Writer, I have been very inquiſitive concerning myſelf, and, while I have been endeavouring to glean Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and other Materials for the Embelliſhment of my Paper, I have made it my Buſineſs to collect all the Intelligence I could in relation to Mr. <hi>Ranger.</hi> With this View, I have ſpent Two-pence in every Coffee houſe within the Bills of Mortality, and I have ſome Time paſt ſtood liſtening to the Buzz of Fame around me; as the Lion is ſaid, when he has fill'd the Foreſt with Terror, to ſtop ſhort in his Career, in order to obſerve the Effects of that Alarm, which his Roaring has occaſioned among the Tenants of the Wood. Some, I find, are pleaſed that a Satyriſt is ſtalking abroad; others afraid of coming under his Laſh; and different Reports prevail in different Quarters. In one Part of the Town I am a black Man, in another a fair one; now tall, now ſhort; now fat, now lean; <hi>Engliſh, Scotch,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> by Turns. At <hi>Sam</hi>'s Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, in the City, I have a Place in the Cuſtom-houſe; at <hi>Batſon</hi>'s I am a Phyſician without Practice. From thence my Conſequence grows leſs by Degrees, and dwindles all along <hi>Cheapſide</hi> and <hi>Fleetſtreet;</hi> inſomuch that my Spirits would ſubſide to a very low Ebb, did not my Fame again ſtart up at the Coffee-houſes about
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0311400901:123"/>the <hi>Temple,</hi> where I am repreſented in various Lights; and no later than Yeſterday, I over-heard a ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking Man ſaying to his Friend, <q>I am not fond of giving any Body an ill Word, but I believe he is an Attorney.</q> From <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> Weſtward my Reputation gathers Strength and Luſtre, and by the Time it reaches the <hi>Bedford,</hi> 
                     <q>I am a damned fine Fellow, that have ſeen a great deal of the World, KILLED my Man, debauched my Girl, intrigued with a Counteſs, cuckolded an Alderman, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Bottle-Companion; a Wit, a Blood, a Mimic, and what not?</q> Were I a Dupe to Popularity, I ſhould certainly derive a very exquiſite Pleaſure from theſe various Deſcriptions, as I flatter myſelf that a Perſon muſt have ſome Degree of Importance, before he can thus become the Topic of public Converſation. There is another Circumſtance which does not a little adminiſter to my Pleaſure; and that is the Variety of unknown Correſpondents, from whom I am frequently honoured with Epiſtles in this my public Capacity. Some of theſe Gentlemen are ſo obliging as to pay their Compliments to my <hi>excellent Talents;</hi> but all ſuch Tokens of Civility, I beg Leave to ſuppreſs; nor ſhall I take this Opportunity to write in Terms of Adulation, under an imagined Character to myſelf; though I know it is the Practice of many Brother Authors, and though I am not inſenſible of the delectable Sounds, <q>Dear <hi>Ranger,</hi> your Predeceſſor the <hi>Tatler, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0311400901:124"/>flattering Temptation, and I ſhall fill up the Remainder of my Paper, with a few ſhort, but real Epiſtles, which came to hand ſince my laſt.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>OETRY and Painting have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Siſter-Arts by Men of Taſte in all Ages, and accordingly we find them both, in the Writings of all good Criticks, from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> down to <hi>Dryden</hi> and the <hi>Abbé du Bos,</hi> mutually borrowing Side-lights, and reflecting Luſtre upon each other. They juſtly have the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence among the Arts of Imitation and Deſign, as they convey their Ideas by Signs more fixed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate than any of the others, and boaſt a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Scope to cull and ſelect from all Nature, in order to adorn and embelliſh the favourite Piece.</p>
                  <p>I am aware that it may be ſaid, Statuary has very near the ſame Advantage; and, that the Artiſt in this Way may obſerve the Knitting of a Joint in one, the Turn of a Neck in another, the Form of the Head in a Third, the Shape and Rounding of a Limb in a Fourth; and that, in ſhort, from a Survey of ſundry Objects, a complete and perfect Whole may be executed. But it muſt be remembered, at the ſame Time, that Statuary has not ſo ample a Field to range in, as the two firſt-mentioned, and is therefore greatly inferior to both.</p>
                  <p>Painting, in one particular Inſtance, ſeems to gain the Aſcendant over Poetry, being univerſally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0311400901:142"/>in every Clime and every Age, whereas the latter is confined to much narrower Limits, both in Time and Place. A <hi>Raphael</hi> painted, and a <hi>Vida</hi> wrote at the ſame Period; and how confined is the Reputation of the latter, when compared to the extenſive Renown which has attended the Name of the firſt, through every Age and Country? The Aera may arrive, when, through the Inſtability of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, the Stile of <hi>Joſeph Andrews</hi> and <hi>Tom Jones</hi> ſhall be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated, when the Characters ſhall be unintelligible, and the Humour loſe its Reliſh; but the many Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, which the Manners-painting Hand of <hi>Hogarth</hi> has called forth into mimic Life, will not fade ſo ſoon, from the Canvaſs; and that admirable <hi>Pictureſque Comedy,</hi> the <hi>March to Finchley,</hi> will perhaps divert Poſterity as long as the <hi>Foundling-Hoſpital</hi> ſhall do honour to the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Nation. A Picture ſpeaks the Language of every Nation, and is univerſally felt and underſtood in many different Countries at the ſame Time, in this Inſtance partaking the Advantages of MUSICK, which is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſubject to many Reſtrictions, to which the Art of Painting is entirely a Stranger. The Caprice and Whim of different Nations prevent the Power of Harmony from becoming ſo univerſal in its Influence; for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Beauty of it, conſiſting in an Imitation of the Sounds appropriated to our ſeveral Paſſions, and thoſe Sounds varying according to the Habits and Dialect of every different People, it follows of Courſe, that the Muſick of any one Country muſt undergo many Changes and Variations, before it can be adapted to the Ear of a Man, who has reſided for any Time in another Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This Inconvenience the Art of Painting is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, and in this Reſpect has the Advantage over Poetry, though in almoſt every other Point, it is obliged
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0311400901:143"/>to yield the Pre-eminence. It has been long ſince ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that Truth is agreeable to the Underſtanding, and fine Imagery to the Fancy; but neither of them, we find, affords ſo intenſe a Pleaſure, as when the Paſſions are agitated and worked into a Ferment. We then attach ourſelves ſtrongly to the Object, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites theſe Emotions; we are pleaſed to be wakened from a State of ſtill Life; and it is a Gratification to our moral Senſe, to find our Hearts ſenſible and alive to thoſe Senſations, which are the Ornament of our Nature. This being the Caſe, I believe, it may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted without incurring the Danger of a Controverſy, that Poetry boaſts this Power over the Paſſions beyond any other Art, at the ſame Time that it is a Vehicle for Inſtruction, and derives much of its Beauty from the Scenes of pictureſque Imagination. Painting indeed partakes ſufficiently of theſe Qualities, to entitle her to the Name of Siſter, has many Features like, and in the Execution of her Deſigns is moſtly directed by the ſame Rules. Both muſt have Unity of Action and Unity of Character, and both have a Latitude to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce ſubordinate Perſonages, concerned in the main Buſineſs, and to exhibit them in proper Attitudes. A Metaphor may be as bold in Painting as in Poetry; an Allegory may be as inſtructive and pleaſing to the Fancy upon Canvaſs, as in the written Page; what the Critics call Machinery, may be diſplayed in as elegant Strockes with the Pencil as with the Pen; the Fairy-way of Writing, mentioned by <hi>Dryden,</hi> may be made Uſe of in Colours, and the Fancy of the Artiſt, like a new Creation, may ſtart to the Eye an whole Race of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Beings. Some of the fineſt Paſſages in Epic and Dramatic Poeſy, are thoſe, where a Conflict is marked between ſeveral warring Paſſions; Painting throws theſe immediately before the Eye, and in Tints
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0311400901:144"/>artfully blended, the nice Aſſemblage is delineated in the moſt ſtriking Manner. A further Inſtance of the Congruity between theſe two Arts, is, that when a Poet has been laviſh in a Deſcription, the beſt Method of examining the Juſtneſs of it is, to conſider what Kind of Figure it would make upon Canvaſs; and on the other Hand, the Deſcriptions, which we find in the Poets, may ſerve to ſupply Hints and Inſtruction to the Painter of Taſte and Poetick Imagination. Add to this, that, as the chief Beauty of Poetick Diction does not conſiſt in a Profuſion of Ornaments, high Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, and a Flouriſh of Words, ſo in the other, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours too rich and glowing are diſapproved, and the Excellence of both Arts, is ſeen in regular Deſigns, and a juſt Imitation of Nature.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients were enthuſiaſtick Admirers of all the imitative Arts, particularly Painting, and upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, we find them expreſſing a Taſte for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the famous Artiſts. Accordingly their Poets ſeize every Opportunity of deſcribing a Picture, a Piece of Sculpture, or any of the Works of the Loom. <hi>Ovid</hi> never omits it, where it naturally grows out of his Subject, and <hi>Virgil</hi> never ſeems more delighted than when he is laying before our Eyes the Shield of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> or, like a ſkilful Virtuoſo, pointing out to our Obſervation, the Beauties of a fine Painting:
<q>
                        <l>Artificumque manus inter ſe operumque laborem</l>
                        <l>Miratur—</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pleaſure in this Caſe is <hi>redoubled</hi> upon the Mind, ſpringing from a twofold Source; for the Delight we take in all poetick Deſcription, is chiefly owing to the natural Love we have for Imitation, which affords an
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0311400901:145"/>Opportunity of comparing the Tranſcript with the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Object; and, when we peruſe the Deſcription of a Picture, we admire not only the Poet's Repreſentation of it, but the Talent of the Artiſt, who has thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to delineate by his Pencil ſo exact a Reſemblance of Things, which have their Exiſtence in Nature; and thus the Mind has two Arts to examine at once, and dwells between them both in a Suſpenſe of Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>I have always admired the Deſcription in the firſt <hi>Aeneid</hi> of that exquiſite Piece of Painting of the Wars at <hi>Troy;</hi> and I think, the Poet's Account of it may ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to us ſome Notion of the ſublime Ideas he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the Siſter-Art of Poetry. All the Figures, which he mentions, are bold and animated; every Thing is in Motion, and, if I may be allowed to apply a Line of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s,
<q>All Matter quick and burſting into Life.</q>
What an Image have we of the <hi>Trojans</hi> repelling the Enemy, and of <hi>Achilles,</hi> with his nodding Plume, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at their Heels in his Turn? You think you hear the Sounding of his Carr, and you imagine you ſee him with his Arm aloft in Act to ſtrike.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Hac fugerent Danai, premeret Trojana juventus;</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Hac Phryges,</hi> INSTARET CURRU CRISTATUS ACHILLES.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Situation of <hi>Troilus</hi> has been often admired, and the Proceſſion of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Nymphs will always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the tendereſt Sentiments, and, I dare affirm, a finer Groupe was never imagined. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Looks, their diſhevelled Hair, and the beating of their Breaſts, are all ſtriking Circumſtances.</p>
                  <q>

                        <p>Without any further Detail, you muſt know then, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> that I am the Son of a Tradeſman in the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> long ſince deceaſed; the Lowneſs of my Father's Circumſtances would but barely ſuffice for the Maintenance of a numerous Family, and you will therefore ſuggeſt to yourſelf, that my Education could not be better than what is afforded in the Generality of Country-Village Schools. In vain did my Father ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit the Aſſiſtance of a rich Relation of his at <hi>Briſtol;</hi> in vain did he repreſent the promiſing Genius of his Son, if put under proper Culture. Deaf to the Ties of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity, though poſſeſſed of an Eſtate of fifteen hundred <hi>per Annum,</hi> and a large perſonal Fortune, without the Charge of a Family, and any Likelihood of having
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0311400901:149"/>any, he would afford him no Aſſiſtance; and I was therefore obliged, after having gleaned up all I could in the ſhort Time I was at School, to ſeek a Service with a neighbouring Farmer. With him I lived ſeveral Years driving Plough, and employed in other Sort of Huſbandry, when News arrived of the Death of the Relation I mentioned, and of his having left me all his real Eſtate, with ſix Thouſand Pounds in Money, and three Thouſand Pounds to each of my four Siſters. When I tell you that from my Education, and the Nature of my Servitude, I contracted a very ſtrong Byaſs to low Company, you will imagine, I muſt make but a very indifferent Figure in my new Station. I was then two and twenty, and had never been accuſtomed to any Kind of Intemperance; and if my former Situation had enabled me to have been reckoned Company for the Gentlemen of the Place, I might ſtill have continued a ſober Man; but unhappily for me, the Circumſtance of my having been a Servant, made me, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Largeneſs of my Fortune, ſhunned and deſpiſed, and I was conſtrained to herd with my former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and others of better Subſtance, but abandoned Morals, with whom I ſoon acquired an Habit of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Debauchery, by which, in a few Years, I found my ready Money exhauſted. To gratify the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of my Paſſions, which were now become violent and unruly, I was adviſed to take up ſome Money upon Part of my Eſtate, and to this Purpoſe I applied to a neighbouring Lawyer, who ſoon procured it for me. As the Meanneſs of my Education had hindered me from knowing any Thing of Law Affairs, I got my two Companions to overlook the Mortgage Deed, and with their Advice ſigned it, and they alſo ſet their Hands as Witneſſes.</p>

You will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally imagine, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> that in Town I taſted all the Pleaſures it could give me; I ſaw every Thing, but ſtill in the worſt Company, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſurrounded by a Set of Sharpers, till having ſquandered away all my Money, and got conſiderably in Debt, I was arreſted and ſent to the <hi>Fleet.</hi> In this Situation I directed my Lawyer to remit me ſome Money, and the Arreſt gave me no Concern, as I made no Doubt of being quickly at Liberty; but judge, Sir, my Surprize, when I was informed, that the Lawyer was in Poſſeſſion of my whole Eſtate, by an abſolute Surrender from me, which I had through Ignorance ſigned inſtead of a Mortgage deed, and that my two Friends, who had left me juſt before I was arreſted, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for the Attorney to witneſs the whole Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action. The Bitterneſs of this Calamity, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of a miſpent Life, filled me with the ſevereſt Grief, and would have entirely extinguiſhed the Uſe of what little Reaſon I had, but for the Charity of a Fellow-Priſoner, who, touched with a Senſe of my Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, not only did every Thing to alleviate them, but infuſed ſuch a Portion of Knowledge and Philoſophy into my Mind, during our long Impriſonment, as muſt for ever render me ſenſible of his Kindneſs. Let me finiſh the Account of my Life, when I have told you, that I was freed from my Impriſonment by the laſt Act of Grace, and that, with a moderate Suſtenance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by honeſt Induſtry, I find myſelf more happy and contented now, than when poſſeſſed of Affluence, and a Mind immerſed in Ignorance and Folly.</p>

                        <p>From this Account of myſelf and my Family, I ſhall only draw one Inference, that if the Relation, who left us ſo liberally at his Death, had but given us a good Education, and behaved to us in his Life-time agreeably to the Eſtate he intended to leave us, the Misfortune we have met with, might, in all human Probability, have been avoided; and being connected by Marriage, or otherways, with Families of Credit and Reputation, we might now remain in Affluence, and enjoy a Name unſullied by Vice and Infamy.

                  <p>The preceding Story is told by my Correſpondent, in ſo intereſting a Manner, that I could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it from the Publick this Day, and I not only agree with him in his Remark, that his Misfortunes would all have been prevented by a proper Education, but I will add, that a Mind, which ſupported itſelf ſo well
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0311400901:152"/>under Affliction, and that can look back to former Scenes of Life with ſo much Senſibility, would have imbibed ſuch Impreſſions from an early Improvement, as might have rendered him an Ornament to any Family. If many of thoſe, who find any ſtriking Incidents in the Series of their Lives, would thus communicate them to the Public, it would be a very great Service to Society, as it would ſerve to detect the Ways of the World, and might put the Unwary upon their Guard againſt ill-deſigning Men. There is ſomething extremely affecting in the Ruin of my Correſpondent's four Siſters, but I am, however, highly pleaſed that he now enjoys a Tranquillity of Mind, and that, to alleviate Calamity, his Reſources are in Virtue and honeſt Induſtry. I muſt obſerve, that the Inattention of the old Gentleman, who died at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to the Manners and Morals of his Relations, ſhewed ſomething in him highly illiberal, not to give it a worſe Epithet; and it is owing to this Indifference to the Improvement of the riſing Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we frequently ſee Eſtates in the Hands of thoſe who are a Diſgrace to Riches; and while this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to be the Caſe, it is not to be wondered, that we meet with ſo many Boobies of Faſhion, inelegant in their Behaviour, looſe in their Morals, and fit to ride behind the Equipage, in which their Pride now lolls at Eaſe.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Laurel, which has been ſo much ſought by the Writers of every Age, is not unlike the Golden Branch mentioned in the ſixth <hi>Aeneid;</hi> if a Man is born to ſhare the Prize, it is eaſily obtained; but if there be not derived from Heaven a Superiority of Genius, fruitleſs is the Endeavour of the unborn Poet, who thinks to arrive at the Heights of Fame by painful Vigils and the Dint of Labour and Application. A Medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity in Poetry will never be allowed: <hi>Horace</hi> tells us that the Suffrages of both Gods and Men are againſt it, and that a Writer of this Caſt muſt never expect to ſee his Name on the Bookſeller's Rubrick-Poſt. Poetry requires warm and glowing Colours; the Language of it muſt be elevated above the Diction of Proſe; the Expreſſions ſhould be more animated, and the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Reader more immediately ſtruck at, than in any other kind of Writing; and whoever has not
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0311400901:155"/>Energy of Genius to cultivate theſe Qualities, will be always ſure to be neglected as a cold and ſpiritleſs Author.</p>
                  <p>Of all the different Species of Poetry, the Dramatic is the moſt difficult to ſucceed in, and, as it is expreſſed in the Words of my Motto, thoſe few only, whom Heaven has peculiarly favoured with an Elevation of Mind, have been able to acquit themſelves with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Our much admired <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> ſtands yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivalled; he ſeized the Laurel with a Maſter-Hand at one Graſp; <hi>Johnſon,</hi> by ſlower Degrees, though eager in Purſuit; <hi>aviduſque refringit cunctantem;</hi> and <hi>Otway</hi> ſeems to have gained it with Facility.</p>
                  <p>I am pleaſed to find, that an Author juſtly celebrated among the foremoſt Succeſſors of theſe immortal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's, has added another Wreath to that Garland, which the Muſes long ſince wove for him; and, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the Public is greatly indebted to him for his <hi>new Tragedy</hi> of the <hi>Brothers,</hi> which was lately acted for the firſt Time at <hi>Drury-Lane.</hi> At the ſame Time that I advance this, I muſt obſerve, that the Subject of it is not perhaps as intereſting to a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Audience, as a more domeſtick Story; and the Generality of People not being acquainted with the Hiſtory of that Monarchy, it thence reſults that the Diſtreſs of the King of <hi>Macedon</hi> does not engage our Paſſions ſo forcibly as might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. It may be added, that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, at that Point of Time, to be at Variance with the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, for which we have contracted a kind of reverential Eſteem; and on this Account thoſe ſublime Sentiments, which <hi>Philip</hi> utters in the Scene with the Ambaſſadors, againſt that Republick, are not received with a ſufficient Degree of Warmth. But if it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Monarchy, though it dwindled by inſenſible Degrees, and was at laſt ſwallowed up
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0311400901:156"/>by the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, was at one Time the moſt flouriſhing in <hi>Europe,</hi> I apprehend no Man can be entirely unconcerned in the Fall of ſo brave a People. I do not doubt but the Mention of <hi>Creſſi</hi> and <hi>Poitiers</hi> would have a more powerful Influence on the Paſſions of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> than <hi>Thraſymene</hi> and <hi>Cannae;</hi> but for my Part, my Breaſt glowed to hear of thoſe memorable Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, which had like to have been ſo fatal to the <hi>Roman</hi> Republick; nor do I remember a grander Sentiment than that of <hi>Philip,</hi> when the Flight of <hi>Hannibal</hi> at <hi>Capua</hi> is urged by the Embaſſy of <hi>Rome.</hi> His Anſwer is, <hi>Ay, there indeed I was not with him.</hi> The Scene which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds this, is full of as tender Emotions as I have ever felt in any Theatre; the Anguiſh of the Father, to find a Diſcord ſubſiſting between his Children, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance with which he endeavours to ſooth them, muſt ſoften the Mind of every Hearer.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Why do I ſigh? Do ye not know, my Sons?</l>
                     <l>And if you do, Oh! let me ſigh no more!</l>
                     <l>Let theſe white Hairs put in a Claim to Peace.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Perhaps no Characters can be better marked than thoſe of <hi>Philip, Perſeus,</hi> and <hi>Demetrius;</hi> for the two laſt of which we are finely prepared by the following Lines.*</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>— They both are bright; but one</l>
                     <l>Benignly bright, as Stars to Mariners;</l>
                     <l>And one a Comet with malignant Blaze</l>
                     <l>Denouncing Ruin.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Art of moſt Writers for the Stage is to exhibit one Character, and that perhaps without any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Qualities to ſeparate it from other Heroes; but in this Play we are entertained with three of a different
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0311400901:157"/>Caſt, and each ſtrongly marked. <hi>Philip</hi> is diſtinguiſhed by a Warmth of Temper, an Haughtineſs of Soul, and a Tenderneſs for his Children, that runs over in the moſt affecting Manner. <hi>Perſeus</hi> is a different Villain from any we have ſeen on the Stage; Policy and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very are ſo blended in him, that we ſee their mixed Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in every Scene; and <hi>Demetrius</hi> is of ſo amiable a Diſpoſition, that an Audience muſt be naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to love him, and for his Sake to dread the reſtleſs turbulent Spirit of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> whoſe Contempt of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> vents itſelf in a ſneering artful Strain.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>You that admire the <hi>Romans,</hi> break the Bridge</l>
                     <l>With <hi>Cocles,</hi> or with <hi>Curtius</hi> leap the Gulph:</l>
                     <l>And league not with the Vices of our Foes.</l>
                     <l>I hear, Sir, you take Wing and mount in Metre;</l>
                     <l>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Invocation, which is uttered by the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, is carried on in a maſterly Manner, filling the Mind with a Train of awful Ideas, and riſing in a Climax of Horror to the laſt Line.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Hear, from thy Ebon Throne, profoundeſt Night,</l>
                     <l>Thou and thy gloomy Daughters all, that ſmile</l>

                     <l>That keep the Door of black Conſpiracy,</l>
                     <l>And ſnuff the grateful Scent of human Blood;</l>

                     <l>And burſting through the Barriers of this World,</l>
                     <l>Stand in dread Contraſt to the Golden Sun,</l>
                     <l>And ſpread around your peſtilential Blaſts,</l>
                     <l>That wither every Virtue in the Bud;</l>
                     <l>While I tranſport ye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </l>

                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0311400901:158"/>
It will be unneceſſary to remind my Readers of the Trial-Scene, which muſt inevitably fire the intelligent Mind with a claſſic Warmth. I cannot help thinking that the Author, in this Paſſage, has given a juſt Idea of the two different Kinds of Eloquence, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Perſeus</hi> enters immediately into the Matter; his Sentences are ſtrong and nervous; and, ſure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the Underſtanding by the Clearneſs of his Diction, he does not condeſcend to addreſs the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It is true, he at one Time ſheds Tears, but that is only to obviate the Power of Eloquence, which he is aware might be uſed by his Brother, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving imbibed the Art of <hi>Roman</hi> Oratory, ſets out in the moſt inſinuating Manner; tries the Avenues to the Paſſions, and endeavours to win his Hearers by Perſuaſion. I am ſenſible that this Beauty may eſcape the Multitude, but, even without this ſecondary Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the Scene cannot ſail of ſtriking every Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>The Diſtreſs of <hi>Demetrius</hi> in the fourth and fifth Act bears hard upon our Affections, and it muſt be a Torture to every compaſſionate Heart, to ſee him undone by the Artifices of Villainy. His Speech, when diſcovered in Gaol, has many affecting Strokes.

Now your Petitioners humbly apprehend, that they ſhall be precluded this Advantage, by the bill now depending in your Honourable Houſe; for ſhould it be neceſſary, to render a Marriage valid, that a Licence muſt be granted in the Preſence of the Parties Parents, or next Relations, it is much to be feared, that a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> ignorant of the gay World, may not pay a due Regard to the Diſtinctions of a laced Coat, and ſmart-cocked Hat; whereby your Petitioners will be under an abſolute Neceſſity of obtaining the Conſent of ſuch a Wordling, who will probably, from a Narrowneſs of thinking, acquired by pecuniary Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, imagine, that we are not entitled to a Fortune, becauſe we have none of our own. Now we beg Leave to ſuggeſt, that, ſhould we be deprived of this valuable Branch of our Profeſſion, Neceſſity, which ſuperſedes all Law, may compel us to go on the Highway; the Effects of which may be ſo fatal to the good People of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that undoubtedly an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will exert their utmoſt Wiſdom to prevent them. We therefore hope, for theſe Reaſons, that the Bill will be rejected.—</p>

                  <p>The gloomy Month of <hi>November</hi> being paſſed, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that the horrid Crime of Suicide would ceaſe, at leaſt till the Return of that heavy Time of the Year. It is certainly a poor Deſertion from the Dignity of our Nature, to ſuffer the Preſſure of the Atmoſphere, or any other ſublunary Incident, to make ſuch an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon our Spirits, as to render us avowed Enemies to ourſelves. I have heard a popular Inſurrection called, an unnatural Rebellion; but by what Name ſhall we ſtigmatize an Action, which flies in the Face of our Maker, which dares to thwart the Diſpenſations of the ſupreme Being, and ſay to eternal Providence, who from the firſt ordained all Things for the beſt,
<q>"NOT THINE, BUT MY WILL BE DONE?"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It requires no Profuſion of Imagery, no bold daring Metaphor, no ſtudied Hyperbole to repreſent this Piece of Impiety in its proper Colours; it ſtrikes the Eye at once in its moſt flagrant atrocious Dye, and were it ſufficiently attended to, it would teach a due Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Determinations of Heaven, and would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all that Train of Evils, from which any thinking Mind muſt now ſtart back appalled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0311400901:163"/>If Self-Preſervation is the neareſt Principle to the Heart of Man, what a Perverſion of our Faculties, of our Reaſon, and our Judgment, muſt uſurp the Mind of him, who thus runs counter to the very End of his Creation! The Dignity of the human Soul is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; not only his Power of Reflexion is ſuppreſſed, but his very Paſſions are thrown off their Byaſs; they are ſeduced from their original Inſtitution; their Nature, Uſe, and End is perverted; and what before ſought real or apparent Pleaſure, and avoided actual or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Pain, now by a ſtrange Fatality ſeeks its own Deſtruction. Anarchy and Civil War diſturb the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and the Man bears his own ſecret Enemy in his Breaſt; he forms a Deſign upon his own Life; he has the Air drawn Dagger conſtantly before his Eyes, and he at length becomes his <hi>own Macheth.</hi> Not even the bloody Purpoſer of determined Vengeance on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Head (horrid as the Crime appears) is half ſo aſtoniſhing; becauſe he does not carry with him half the Abſurdity. The latter has Time left him to atone by Penitence for his Barbarity, whereas the Suicide urges precipitantly to the Tribunal of his offended God.</p>
                  <p>The real Source of this fatal Evil is perhaps hard to be aſcertained; but if it is not originally an Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Pride, it is tinged with it ſo ſtrongly, that there is Reaſon to conclude, it is frequently derived from thence. Self Love will always induce us to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our Rank in the Scale of Beings, and when once the Imagination is ſtruck with the Idea of fancied Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, each little Trial of Adverſity is conſidered as a Grievance intolerable; it is too much for the Man to bear; he concludes himſelf a deſtined Mark for Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and, rather than drag a feveriſh Life under an
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0311400901:164"/>huge Load of Miſery, he proudly reſolves to put an End to his Sufferings, and meaſure out the Thread of his own Exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>For my own Part, I cannot look upon any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence in this World of Conſequence ſufficient to urge a Man to this Extreme of Madneſs. Is he reduced to Want by his inordinate Expences, or do the Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Circumſtances prevent him from emerging into that Station of Life, which his Ambition would aſpire to?—Let him but examine the Happineſs of the Affluent; how many want with a full Purſe, how many are tortured with Diſeaſes, or eaten up with uneaſy Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? Have a Man's Relations unworthily withdrawn their Protection from him? there are Occupations enough, in which he may endeavour to ſupport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without their Aſſiſtance; and then he will have the Satisfaction of living independent of thoſe who have deſerted him; and ſhould he fail, his honeſt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence will at all Times be a Diſgrace to them; ſo that either Way he will be a living Affront to his falſe Friends.</p>
                  <p>In ſo polite an Age it may not be proper to corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate what has been advanced, by Arguments drawn from Religion; but if an Heathen may have any Weight in the Affair, I would inform the Man of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, that <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> were both of Opinion, that we are placed in this World, as Soldiers upon Duty, and that no one has a Right to move without the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of his commanding Officer; and <hi>Virgil</hi> in the Words of my Motto tells us, that there is a Place of Retribution for thoſe unhappy Wretches, who dare to lay violent Hands upon themſelves, and, prodigal of Life, to precipitate their Souls into Eternity. They would be glad, continues the Poet, to bear Poverty and the ſharpeſt Miſeries, could they again return to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0311400901:165"/>Life; but the Fates forbid them, and their Paſſage is irremeable.</p>
                  <p>To theſe Authorities, I would beg Leave to add the Sentiment of our great <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> who, though he may be juſtly ſuſpected of Chriſtianity, was ſtill a Poet, and therefore may be cited on this Occaſion. He has introduced a young Prince, deliberating, whether he ſhould not extricate himſelf from the Troubles of this World, by boldly putting an End to his Reſidence on this Side of the Grave. The Point is argued with great Strength of Reaſoning; the Calamities of this Life are thrown into the Scale, and after ſtating every Thing in the moſt ſtriking Colours, a Proſpect of Futurity opens to the Imagination, and the Mind ſtarts back from the deſperate Act, convinced that it is our Duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Life, and bear our Portion with Fortitude, until Heaven ſhall be pleaſed to put in Execution that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death, which it has paſſed on all Mankind.</p>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0311400901:166"/>traordinary Cure I lately met with. I have had for many Months ſucceſſively a flow nervous Fever, with a conſtant Flutter on my Spirits, attended with pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Watchings, Twitchings of the Nerves, and other grievous Symptoms, which reduced me to a mere Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. At length a Friend, who had himſelf expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced it, adviſed me to have Recourſe to the reading of the <hi>Inſpector</hi>'s Papers. I accordingly took one of them over Night, and the Conſequence was, I fell into a profound Sleep, which laſted near ſix and thirty Hours. Since that I have been ordered, for fear of a Lethargy, to take them in ſmaller Quantities. A Paragraph at a Time now anſwers my Purpoſe, and, under Heaven, I owe my ſleeping Faculties to the above-mentioned <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector.</hi> I look upon them to be a grand <hi>Soporificum mirabile,</hi> proper to be had in all Families. He makes great Allowance to thoſe who buy 'em to ſell again, or ſend abroad to the Plantations. The above Fact I am ready to atteſt, when called upon.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> WENT, one Morning laſt Week to pay a Viſit to a Lady, for whom I have always had a very great Reſpect. An Excurſion which ſhe made, into the Country, was the Occaſion of my not having ſeen her for ſome Time, but upon the firſt Notice of her being in Town, I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately did myſelf the Favour of waiting on her. It was with great Satisfaction, that I perceived her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion florid to the higheſt Degree of Health. As I knew ſhe had two Sons at <hi>Eton</hi> School, I enquired after the young Gentlemen, and received for Anſwer, that the Brats were minding their Books. <q>Boys, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) are beſt when out of one's Way — they make ſuch a Noiſe in an Houſe, that there is really no ſuch Thing as bearing with them — I hope they are going on well — But, Sir, you don't know all my Family.</q> Upon this ſhe rung the Bell, and ordered the Servant to bring down Miſs <hi>Lucy</hi> and Miſs <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and then continued Mrs. <hi>Bizarre,</hi> 
                     <q>they are both quite jealous of one another; Miſs <hi>Lucy</hi> has taken a Notion into her Head that <hi>Charlotte</hi> is my Favourite, and <hi>Charlotte</hi> equally ſuſpects my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to <hi>Lucy,</hi> — but upon my Word, it is without Foundation; I give them no Manner of Reaſon, — well, now I think it would be quite wrong in me to make any Difference, when they are both deſerving;— I vow and proteſt, I love them both alike — I can't think how ſome Folks can be ſo—to be ſure it's

                  <p>The Diſappointment I met with flung me into ſome Confuſion, and I retired back in a very aukward Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to my Chair. <q>There, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> (reaſſumed the Lady) this is Miſs <hi>Lucy</hi> and this is Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> — Pray, Sir, don't you think they have very pretty turned Faces — there's a Family Likeneſs between them, I think — they are the only Comfort I have — Pray, <hi>Molly,</hi> did Miſs <hi>Lucy,</hi> take the Manna as the Doctor ordered, — Lord, I was frighted out of my Wits Yeſterday, the poor thing was ſo terribly pained with the Cholic — and Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> has been coughing all the Morning; I hope it won't fall upon her Lungs; — they are the ſweeteſt Creatures in the World — Where's your Curtſey, Miſs, when a Gentleman ſpeaks to you? — She is abſolutely, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> the greateſt Prude in <hi>London</hi> — She quarrels with the Maid, if ſhe but leaves her Breaſt the leaſt uncovered; and you know, the Faſhion is now to ſhew as low as one poſſibly can— and her Siſter there, Miſs <hi>Charlotte,</hi> ſhe is the violenteſt Coquet in Nature — <hi>Molly,</hi> give that Fan — See how ſhe handles it — Soft Affectation plays about her twiſted Neck, as it's in the Play — don't you think ſhe has fine Eyes? — Well, did you ever ſee ſuch a pretty little Mouth;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0311400901:169"/>and the fineſt Teeth — I am afraid ſhe is a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to be ſat — She'll never be taller — Lard, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> I wiſh I could get her a Huſband; I ſhould be glad to ſee her well ſettled — he, he, he.— Now, I have a queer Notion in my Head — Do you know that I have a Huſband in my Eye for her? — Gueſs who it is</q> — To this I took Occaſion to anſwer, that there are really ſo many pretty Gentlemen about Town, that it would be abſolutely impoſſible for me to form a right Conjecture, and I therefore begged ſhe would be ſo kind as to inform me. <q>Why, Sir, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe) there is <hi>Tom Titmouſe,</hi> that is always biting his Lips, and never has a Bit of his Shoe ſeen above his Buckle; and <hi>Billy Wirewig,</hi> who always ſtinks of Perfume; or <hi>Jemmy Doll,</hi> with the delicate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and the little mincing Step; but it is not any of them — O fie, the Frights! — do you think I would accept of any of 'em — I aſſure you, Sir, I refuſed a much better Offer — I could have had Captain <hi>Jeſſamy</hi> of the Guards, but I have a finer Thought in my Head now — Was you ever at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Midnight</hi>'s? — To be ſure you was, he, he, he, — Well, for certain, I am a comical Woman — You remember the pretty dear Creature, that ſits at Supper on the right Hand — he, he, he, it came into my Mind the Moment I ſaw the dear Fellow, that it would be a good Match; and ſo now, as I don't know where to ſend, I have drawn up an Advertiſement which I intend to put into the Papers — here, you may read it, Sir.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I complied with; it was in Subſtance as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If the Monkey, that ſat on the right Hand at <hi>Mother Midnight</hi>'s, and drank a Glaſs of Wine, after bowing to the Company, has no Averſion to Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0311400901:170"/>he is deſired to call at <hi>May-Fair</hi> Chapel, and he will hear of ſomething to his Advantage.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon Peruſal of this extraordinary Advertiſement, I endeavoured to expoſtulate with the good Lady, on the Oddity of her Proceeding, and I remonſtrated, that it would appear to the World the moſt whimſical Thing that was ever practiſed. Irritated at this, Mrs. <hi>Bizarre</hi> could not bear to be touched in ſo tender a Point, and ſhe told me with ſome Vehemence, that Monkeys have often more Senſe than many of the human Species; and I believe the Diſpute would have roſe high between us, had not an Accident put an End to it.</p>
                  <p>While we were engaged in Converſation, a Quarrel happened between the two young Ladies, and in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Miſs <hi>Lucy</hi> tore off Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi>'s Cap; which Compliment was returned in Kind, and then the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was carried on with great Eargerneſs on both Sides, attended with violent Screamings, with bouncing about the Room, leaping on Chairs and Tables, and flying violently in our Faces. All the Ornaments on the Mantle-piece were broke to Shatters; the China Figures, which before ſeem'd to breathe and think, came trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling down. <hi>Woodward</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Clive,</hi> who repreſented in exquiſite <hi>Chelſea-Ware,</hi> their different Characters in <hi>Lethe,</hi> ſhared the general Wreck; Mrs. <hi>Bizarre</hi>'s Face was ſcratched in ſeveral Places, and ſhe alſo loſt in the Fray a very elegant Pair of <hi>Dreſden</hi> Ruſtles.</p>
                  <p>Prudence directed me to eſcape from this ſtrange Scene with the utmoſt Expedition, and as ſoon as I found myſelf in my Chambers, I could not help reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the whimſical Turn of Mind, which diſpoſed this Lady to fix her Heart on ſuch a diſagreeable Race of Animals. When a Woman becomes an Apoſtate from the Laws of Nature, and diveſts herſelf of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0311400901:171"/>Ornaments of her Sex, ſhe is as great an Exotick as any in her Collection of wild Beaſts. I believe, the Pangs of Jealouſy would be much keener in an Huſband's Breaſt, were he to find himſelf rivalled by a Monkey; and for ſuch a Set of odious Creatures to ſee a Perſon neglect her own Children, is ſo fantaſtical a Circumſtance, that ſome of my Readers may perhaps think the Exiſtence of ſuch a Character improbable; but I can aſſure them, that there are frequent Inſtances of it in this Town.</p>
                  <p>To regulate and govern the Imagination, is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by a <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſopher, as a Point of Moment in the Conduct of Life; and moſt aſſuredly the Rule is excellent. The Imagination is the livelieſt Faculty of the Soul, and gives to all Objects the Hue and Colour, which they ſeemingly wear; and we love and hate, hope and fear, according to the Scenes which are pictured to our Fancy. It is this which makes <hi>Quixotilla</hi> call aloud for a Cork; and under a due Government is the Source of that ſprightly Taſte and juſt Senſe of Things, which is remarkable in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica;</hi> it is this which gives new Graces to her Beauty, irradiates her whole Countenance, and in all Scenes and Circumſtances of Life renders her the moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of her Sex.</p>
                  <p>To cultivate, therefore, and cheriſh the natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to direct them to worthy Objects, to keep them all in Harmony, ſo that not one of them ſhall grow out of due Proportion, or contract any whimſical Habit, is the beſt Preſerver and Beautifier of the female Form, it gives that pleaſing Turn of Mind which we call Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper, prevents Wrinkles, Diſtortion of the Features, and gives an agreeable Air to the whole Perſon, as a few of the Sex have experienced; and as ſuch it is this Day recommended to all the female Readers of this Paper.</p>

The Maſter of this Place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the Method of killing as well as any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Faculty, but his Temper of Mind renders him leſs inclinable to put it in Practice; he allows me to be a very good Figure on the Ground; ſays, I ſtand an excellent Attitude, and adds, that, when I bring myſelf to do Things not ſo much in an Hurry, I ſhall ſence as well as any angry Boy in <hi>England.</hi> I muſt own, that I am apt to advance and retreat in too precipitate a Manner, and this Exerciſe throws my Spirits into ſuch a Flurry, that I ſometimes cannot avoid doing Miſchief. I have already put out a Gentleman's Eye, diſlocated three of another's Teeth, and broke my Foil upon the ſmall Ribs of a Third; and, if I proceed in this Manner, I begin to be apprehenſive about the Conſequences which may ariſe from unforeſeen Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and therefore I am now determined to entrench myſelf from Inſults within one of the Reſolutions, which
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0311400901:175"/>I entered into upon the Commencement of this Paper, <hi>viz.</hi> not to deſerve Ill of any Man.</p>
                  <p>It would be well if all the Individuals of Society would enter into a reciprocal Agreement of obſerving the ſame Principle in their Deportment we might then ſee that Harmony ſubſiſt, which as ſociable Beings it is our Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to promote; this would baniſh all ſurly Moroſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and in ſhort, this ſingle Rule, of deſerving I'l from no Man, would prevent all Indecorums and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, and ſubſtitute in their Room mutual Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Good-breeding.</p>
                  <p>But the contrary occurs every Day, and ſeems to be derived from no other Source than a vicious Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our private Humours. A ſelfiſh Spirit is condemned in Ethics as the Cauſe of many Vices, and it is of no leſs evil Influence in the <hi>Petites Morales,</hi> or <hi>leſſer Morals.</hi> When a narrow Regard to a Man's own Senſations gains the Aſcendant, and none will recede from their equal Right of having their own Way, it is not to be wondered, that ill Humours ſhould ſour the Temper, and that frequent Quarrels ſhould ariſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philipſus</hi> has taken it into his Head, that to be briſk and ſhining in Converſation is the moſt elegant Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment he can aſpire to, and therefore has ſpent moſt of his Time in the Acquirement of ſomething, that he calls Wit; but in the Eyes of Men of Senſe, is only a petulant Pertneſs very annoying to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. <hi>Philipſus</hi> has laid it down as a Maxim, that he muſt upon all Occaſions diſplay his favourite Talent, and would rather at any Time loſe his Friend than his Joke. <hi>Antiphaus</hi> is an abſolute Enemy to all Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be ſhining; Converſation with him, muſt be in a plain ſenſible Manner; he will neither give nor take a Joke; hence theſe two are conſtantly at Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0311400901:176"/>and it is imagined by their Friends, that the Affair muſt be at laſt decided behind <hi>Montague-Houſe</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my Part, I have often wondered how Men can be ſuch Enemies to their Pleaſures, as to be thus obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately bent on the Indulgence of their own private Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, without abating any Thing from their Pretenſions, in order to contribute to the Felicity of their Neighbours. The ſocial Paſſions afford more real Delight, than any ſelfiſh Gratifications; the latter are ſure to Occaſion a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of Spirit, while the former expand the Faculties of the Mind, and receive Addition from being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, like the Sun painting the Hemiſphere with Streaks of Light, which ſerve to adorn his Way, and augment the Glory of his Career. In a State of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Dependance, which Nature has allotted to us all, it is not to be imagined that any one will pay the leaſt Deference to our Eaſe and Happineſs, unleſs in our Turn we recede a little from our own Humours and purchaſe by our Deportment that Complacence, which every one deſires to meet with in his Intercourſe with Society.</p>
                  <p>But as this Reſtraint upon our Conduct ſeems to be too much thrown off, it is not to be wondered that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Recourſe is had to Duelling, to decide Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between thoſe, who have renounced the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Reaſon; which would ſurely forbid us to ſquander away the Life — beſtowed upon us by the ſupreme Being, upon ſuch trivial Incidents, as for the moſt Part occaſion theſe Extremities. The <hi>Romans</hi> knew nothing of this modern Practice, which is entirely of <hi>French</hi> Growth, and, like many of the Faſhions of that Country, ſhould be exploded from all civilized Nations. It may not be improper to cite the Definition of Courage from ſo fine a Gentleman
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0311400901:177"/>as Mr. <hi>Addiſon.</hi> In his elegant Poem, entitled the <hi>Campaign,</hi> he tells us,

                     </q> I never yet heard of an Affair between two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, according to the polite Phraſe, but one or both of them was egregiouſly in the Wrong; and, I perſuade myſelf, that if, indead of determining wilfully to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Matters of no Moment, People could be brought to canvaſs their Differences with ſome Degree of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Chearfulneſs, we ſhould not often have Advices from <hi>Morybone Fields,</hi> or any of the uſual Scenes of Action upon theſe Occaſions. To evince this, I ſhall conclude with the following Story. I was once in Company at a Tavern with a Set of Gentlemen, when after much Mirth and Feſtivity, one of the Party, who had been ſilent almoſt the whole Night, accoſted a Gentleman who had contributed greatly to our Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment by a lively Vein of Fancy peculiar to him, in the following Words. <q>Sir, (ſays he) taking him by the Button. I have ſomething to communicate to you — I have obſerved, Sir, — that you have been very facetious all Night, — you have run your Rig upon me, Sir, and ſo — I deſire you will meet me To-morrow Morning in <hi>Pancras</hi> Burying-Ground.</q> — A Blood of the Town would perhaps have been fired at this Propoſal; but my Friend received it with great Compoſure, and while the reſt of the Company were ſtruck dumb at the Solemnity of the Challenge, he turns to him with a Mixture of Jeſt and Earneſt in his Countenance, and whiſpers <q>in <hi>Pancras</hi> Burying Ground, Sir?</q> 
                     <q>Yes, Sir, in <hi>Pancras</hi> Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0311400901:178"/>Ground without fail</q>—Very well, Sir,— <q>muſt I bring my Shroud with me?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pleaſantry of this Queſtion excited a general Laugh in the Room, and the ſolemn Gentleman could not reſiſt the Impulſe of Mirth; he joined in the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, and, as ſoon as he recovered from his Fit of Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, exclaimed, "You're a brave Boy — give us your Hand.—I'll never meet you, but on a Party of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to that you may command me whenever you pleaſe."</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Lively Imagination is, if I may uſe <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear</hi>'s Expreſſion, great Nature's ſecond Courſe; for not content to have enjoyed the intellectual Pleaſures immediately ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the Beauty of external Objects, or the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Scenes of Life, it frequently, when they have vaniſhed and diſappeared, makes fond Excurſions after them again; and even in our Sleep, it will occaſionally recall the Objects of our waking Reflection, and from thence receive livelier Senſations, than were perhaps occaſioned by the firſt Impreſſion. Though there are many fantaſtic Circumſtances in theſe Night Thoughts, if I may be ſo allowed to call our Dreams, yet, on theſe Occaſions, we ſometimes find ourſelves preſented with agreeable Viſions, and, amidſt the wildeſt Vagaries of Fancy, we can often trace ſomething like juſt Reaſoning, and a real Picture of Life. As I take this to have been the Caſe with me a few Nights ſince, I ſhall make no Apology, for throwing my Dream upon Paper this Day.</p>
                  <p>I found myſelf on a ſudden, near a large intricate Wood, which I had the Curioſity to enter. A whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical band of Hope and Fear, Joy and Grief, Pain and Pleaſure hovered over our Heads. Tender An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, ſoft Deſire, pleaſing Agony were all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed, and in their motley Livery formed a many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0311400901:181"/>Groupe. <hi>Cupid</hi> made violent Work with his Darts and Flames, and nothing was to be heard but tinkling Rills, falling Fountains, and love-ſick Sighs, by which the Aſpen Leaves were perpetually kept in a ruſtling Tremor. The God of Love had by him a prodigious Quantity of Arrows, differently feathered, according to the various Effects, of which they were to be productive. This Circumſtance called to my Mind a beautiful Paſſage in a Poem by Doctor <hi>Parnell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>And ev'ry Dart can boaſt a Kind,</l>
                     <l>Which ſuits each proper Turn of Mind.</l>
                     <l>From the tow'ring <hi>Eagle's</hi> Plume</l>
                     <l>The <hi>generous Hearts</hi> accept their Doom.</l>
                     <l>Shot by the <hi>Peacock</hi>'s painted Eye</l>
                     <l>The vain and <hi>airy Lovers</hi> die.</l>
                     <l>For <hi>careful</hi> Dames and <hi>frugal</hi> Men</l>
                     <l>The Shafts are ſpeckled by the <hi>Hen.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>The <hi>Pyes</hi> and <hi>Parrots</hi> deck the Darts,</l>
                     <l>When <hi>Prattling</hi> wins the panting Hearts.</l>
                     <l>When from the <hi>Voice</hi> the Paſſions ſpring,</l>
                     <l>The warbling <hi>Finch</hi> affords a Wing:</l>
                     <l>Together, by the Sparrow ſtung,</l>
                     <l>Down fall the <hi>Wanton</hi> and the <hi>Young;</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>And fledg'd by <hi>Geeſe</hi> the Weapons fly,</l>
                     <l>When others love they know not why.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>It was not unpleaſant to obſerve the Variety of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that were occaſioned in both Sexes by this ſtrange Flight of Arrows. Men I perceived in cloſe purſuit of blooming Virgins, merely from the impulſe of Vanity; and I ſaw ſeveral Nymphs running, with the utmoſt Precipitation, from their Lovers; though by their Manner of looking back, and the ruſtling they made in the Trees, there was room for Conjecture that they did not deſire entirely to eſcape.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0311400901:182"/>Pleaſing as the Senſations of Love are, I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that very unhappy Effects were often the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. Many there were, whoſe Mien ſpoke a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Spirits, and they were frequently driven to ſuch Extremes, that they laid violent Hands on their own Lives. As I travelled on, I ſaw ſeveral hanging on Bows of Trees; and on the Waters, which were ſwelled with Tears, and ruffled with Sighs, floated many a pallid <hi>Corpſe;</hi> in their Countenances I could plainly ſee the Traces of that ſickly Luxury of Thought, which is ſo apt to ſettle into a fixed Deſpair.</p>
                  <p>From this Scene of Diſtreſs, I turned away as ſoon as poſſible; and was relieved from my Uneaſineſs, by the Sight of a few, who ſeemed to be happy in their Paſſion; whoſe Hearts felt a mutual Warmth, and whoſe Eyes were brightened into Gladneſs. They walked Arm in Arm down the flow'ry Meads, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing mutual Glances of Affection; though ever and anon ſucceeded Anger, Suſpicion, open War, and Peace again. In the Center of the Wood, ſtood a Temple ſacred to VIRTUE, where all, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of leading a Life of Happineſs, were directed to bend their Courſe, in Order there to be united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Bands of chaſte Affection. I was ſorry to find that ſome of the Ladies had not Reſolution to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in this Path: Whether it was owing to looſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires or ſeducing Temptation, I cannot decide; certain it is, they tired in their Journey, and ſtepped aſide with their Paramours to ſequeſtred Bowers; from whence they were afterwards diſcarded into the thorny Parts of the Wood, for the Remainder of their Days; but even of theſe, a few there were, who after their Digreſſion, ſtill found Means to be introduced into the Temple; whither they were however purſued by an old Hag, called SCANDAL, who never yet has been known to let them entirely efface the Remembrance of their Error.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0311400901:183"/>The Ladies, who kept on a due Courſe, never failed to lead the Men in Captivity after them to the Temple, from whence, after a ſhort Ceremony, they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed in Pairs, to commence the Road for Life. Three different Paths were open to their Choice, and a Guide ſtood at each Entrance to receive them. The firſt was of a cold diſpaſſionate Temper, who took every Thing alike, and his Name was INDIFFERENCE. The ſecond had Eyes of a greeniſh Caſt, and he ſeemed to loath the Food, which he notwithſtanding eagerly ſwallowed. This Perſonage was called JEALOUSY, and the third by an Openneſs of Countenance, a ſtrong Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of quick Senſibility and cordial Affection, was known to be FRIENDSHIP. Too many gave themſelves up to INDIFFERENCE, and inſtantly an Inattention to each other's Wants ſucceeded in their Breaſts; the Men betook themſelves to Midnight Shouts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velry, and the Fair to Parties of Tea, and Routs, and Drums, by which Means every ſpark of Love was ſoon extinguiſhed, and the Gratification of their own ſeparate Inclinations was their only Study.</p>
                  <p>The Walks of JEALOUSY were craggy, dangerous, and ſteep, full of Thorns, Briars and Brambles. In the Heart, where before Gladneſs and Joy revelled ſecure, aroſe Anxiety, Diſtruſt, and Perturbation of Spirit. The diſtempered Fancy ſtarted at Scenes of its own Creation, and, in a Fit of Madneſs, hurried many a tortured Wretch down the Precipice of Fate, or let fall its Vengeance on its Neighbour. What was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in this Part was, that though ſometimes there were the Appearances, the real Footſteps of Guilt could no where be diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>The very ſmall Number under the Guidance of FRIENDSHIP enjoyed a pure heart-felt Tranquillity; and the fierce Deſire and impatient Wiſh, which had formerly actuated their Minds, having now ſubſided, a ſteady and uniform Flame ſucceeded, not unlike the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0311400901:184"/>mild refreſhing Air of a placid Evening, after the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of an hot Summer's Day. Glad Suns roſe over their Heads, and kindly Nights lulled them in each other's Arms. A ſmiling Race grew up around them, and the Culture of their young and tender Minds af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a pleaſing Employment; they journey'd on thro' Life, bleſſed with the Sunſhine of the Soul, till, at length, the eaſy Diſſolution of Nature put a Period to all human Felicity.</p>
                  <p>Here I could not help exclaiming with the Poet;
<q>
                        <l>O grant me thus to live, and thus to die!</l>
                        <l>Who ſprung from Kings, ſhall know leſs Joy than I.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The whole Scene appeared ſo completely happy, that I began to feel ſome Approaches towards Envy; which ſo diſcompoſed my Spirits, that I was inſtantly awaked, and the ideal Proſpect vaniſhed into Air.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are few Terms which are applied with greater Impropriety, than thoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtical Appellations, which Men uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtow on their Acquaintance, or on others, in whoſe Company and Converſation they may at any Time have been caſually engaged. Every Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, indeed, is formed by the Prevalence of ſome particular Paſſion, which influences the Temper, and gives a caſting Weight to the Genius of the Perſon in whom it ſubſiſts. But no Rules that I know of, have been yet laid down, nor is there any certain Standard which ſhould fix the Degree of Elevation, to which the ruling Paſſion muſt neceſſarily riſe, before it can have Strength ſufficient to determine the Character.</p>
                  <p>The Reader muſt, however, be informed, that I am not ſpeaking of thoſe moral Qualifications, or Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0311400901:186"/>of the Heart, which ſpeculative Writers have taken ſo much idle Pains to adorn and recommend; and which Men of Senſe, or Men of the World, have una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly agreed in rejecting, as unworthy of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Notice. The Qualities I mean are pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Head or Face; Properties, which enable the Poſſeſſor to aſſume a ſolemn Aſpect at Incidents, which ſet the reſt of the Table on a Roar; or to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt what is truly ſerious and grave, by impertinent Queſtions of Levity and Mirth; or laſtly, to condemn and cavil, when all the World ſees the higheſt Reaſons for Applauſe and Admiration. The Effects which theſe Cauſes produce in Life, however various and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in their Appearance, may be reduced to the three general Sources of Wit, Humour, and Criticiſm, and as the Pretenders to theſe ſeveral Qualities are infinite in Number, I have determined on a certain Standard, in order to regulate and adjuſt their Claims. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I propoſe is, to decide their different Pretenſions by the Height and Stature of the Body.</p>
                  <p>And leſt this ſhould be conſidered as a wild chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Deſign, I muſt beg Leave to aſſure my Reader, that the Theory I am forming is built upon the lateſt Diſcoveries, and moſt uncontroverted Principles of true Philoſophy. It is poſſible however, that Perſons of an over-refining Curioſity, may be able to raiſe ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to what I am going to advance, but as every Thing is liable to be called in Queſtion by thoſe who are diſpoſed to cavil, they will give me but little Pain upon that Head. The plaineſt Truths have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and the moſt extravagant Opinions have been fortunate enough to meet with their Advocates and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers. Now, I would have ſuch People recollect what are the general Apprehenſions ariſing in the Mind, on the Sight of an uncommon Stature; and how favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, withal, even the Notions of the Vulgar are to an unuſual Height of Perſon. Is it not commonly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0311400901:187"/>that Men of this ſuperior Eminence poſſeſs as ſuperior Parts, and extraordinary Degrees of Merit. From this Principle, my little Friend of <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> is univerſally cenſured, as falling ſhort of a true Hero, by near half a Foot; whilſt his more aſpiring Antagoniſt is allowed to have all the neceſſary Dimenſions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired both by ancient and modern Precedents, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the heroic Character.</p>
                  <p>It is an Axiom in Philoſophy, which few, I hope, will be ſo hardy as to deny, that the Soul is all and all in every Part. From hence it is obvious, that the Body which is a Covering only for the Aetherial Particle that is lodged within it, muſt neceſſarily receive its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions from the Vigour of the Spirit, which actuates the exterior Frame. The greater Portion of Fire this Spirit is endued with, its elaſtic Qualities will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably ſtronger; and the Dimenſions of the Body will be protruded to a Size, exactly of the ſame Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with the Soul which informs it. On this ſimple Hypotheſis, which I imagine cannot be eaſily diſproved, I proceed to ſettle the reſpective Qualifications of the different Pretenders, who have been mentioned above.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Place, thoſe who, with gentle <hi>William</hi> in the Play, boaſt themſelves not on Account of their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but as they have a <hi>pretty Wit,</hi> do not exceed the loweſt Degree of our appointed Standard. It is not in Nature, that ſuch Perſons can riſe in their Stature, above the Height of five Feet and ſix Inches. For Wit, which is merely an Exerciſe of the Tongue, doth not require the ſame Bulk and Dimenſions, which are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Qualifications of a ſuperior Order. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently a much leſs Exertion of the interior Faculties, than what are productive of that Talent which we call Humour. Hence we muſt advance a little in our Standard; and can admit no one to be a Man of real Humour, who does not come up to the full Height of five Feet and eight Inches; and this ſmall Progreſſion is the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0311400901:188"/>more allowable, as a conſiderable Part of Humour is frequently expreſſed by ſuch Feats of Body, as require ſome little Degree of Size and Strength. Giving a Friend a violent and unexpected Slap upon the Back, or the dexterous Leaping over Chairs and Tables, have been often regarded as ſo many undoubted Signs of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Humour; and are generally agreed to denote a moſt facetious Vein of Pleaſantry, in the Authors of ſuch exquiſite Jokes. It will ſometimes further happen, that theſe two Qualities may be blended in the ſame Perſon; as I doubt not but many of my Readers can recollect ſeveral of their Acquaintance, who are your only Men of Wit and Humour. Now, this Conjunction manifeſtly implies a much ſuperior Energy of Soul; and conſequently, a ſtill higher Advancement in our Scale of characteriſtic Excellencies. Theſe Candidates for Fame will accordingly riſe two Inches above thoſe who are mentioned laſt; and none are to paſs under this Denomination for the future, but whoſe Height is five Feet ten. For theſe Qualities, when thus united, will frequently exert themſelves in Strokes of Gallantry and Mirth, which are ſo much the more honourable as they are dangerous to the Perſon or the Purſe of the ingenious Artiſt, who has the Courage or Curioſity to attempt the Experiment. The demoliſhing of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, knocking down of Watchmen, bilking of Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at Places of Entertainment, with other Inſtances of the like Kind, are very laudable and convincing Proofs of theſe compound Qualities, reſiding together in the ſame Habitation. The laſt Quality, which greatly overtops the reſt, and is indeed the Crown and Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, is the wonderful and moſt ingenious Faculty of modern Criticiſm. And as this is, in the moſt exalted Manner, the Gift of Nature, whoever has the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be born a true Critic, is at leaſt ſix Feet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete. A Critic is the Maſter-piece and nobleſt Work of Nature; and may juſtly be expected to bear about
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0311400901:189"/>him ſome diſtinguiſhing Tokens, which will enable a Spectator, at the firſt View, to acknowledge and revere his Merits. Hence ſhe has beſtowed on him a more than ordinary Portion of the <hi>Daring</hi> and <hi>Tremendous;</hi> and theſe would appear to very little Effect in a Perſon of leſs Dimenſions, than thoſe which we have here aſſigned him. The Wit may be pert and ſanguine; the Man of Humour confident or overbearing; but it is the Critic alone, who glares horribly terrific. His every Look freezes the young Author's Blood; and at the Sound of his Voice, the rooted Seats have been known to be torn from the Ground, and hurled vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently through the Air, in furious and wild Commotion. Phaenomena, like theſe, can only be produced by that iron Strength of Lungs, and brazen Audacity of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, which Nature has ſo liberally imparted to the modern Critic.</p>
                  <p>It will be neceſſary to obviate an Objection ariſing from popular Prejudice, that the Science of Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm being to examine into the Merit of all Productions of Genius and Learning, it does not ſeem to demand the Size and Dimenſions which I have made eſſential to the Character; but the Objectors, I apprehend, are miſtaken in the End of modern Criticiſm; and have not perhaps duly reflected on the neceſſary Qualities to diſcharge the Province they are deſirous of allotting it. To execute that Taſk, would require a moderate Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Senſe, Taſte and Judgment, under the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Modeſty and Candour; Talents ſo little prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by thoſe who have taken up the Occupation of a a Critic, that they appear on all Occaſions not to have the leaſt Conception of them. Whoever will give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Leave to conſider, that the Character of a Critic, a Wit, and Man of Humour, in the preſent Eſtimation of the World, is ſupported wholly by Mechanical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in which the Underſtanding has no Manner of Share, he will eaſily agree with me, that the ſureſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0311400901:190"/>Method to diſcover thoſe Characters, muſt be taken from that Part which is principally concerned; and as we can truly judge from outward Appearances alone, I have ſhewn to a Demonſtration that the Stature of a Perſon is the only infallible Criterion, by which we can decide, on the Juſtneſs of his Pretenſions; and that no one for the future can have any Right to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe Characters, but whoſe Dimenſions will exactly tally with the Meaſures of this Standard.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER ſauntering about for ſome Time the other Morning in <hi>Gray's-Inn-Gardens,</hi> I withdrew to the Edifice raiſed by the great Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> where I ſcarce had ſeated myſelf, when I perceived an elderly Gentleman haſtening towards me. He was of a ruddy, hale Complexion, but had the Air of one ſomewhat diſconcerted in his Mind. Scraping the Ground with one Leg drawn backwards, and holding out his Hat at Arm's Length, he heſitated a Deſire to know if I was Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> the entertaining Writer. Upon anſwering him in the Affirmative, with Regard to the Name, and at the ſame Time, expreſſing ſome Doubt about the Compliment made to me as an Author, the Gentleman immediately looked grave, and ſhaking his Head, <q>Aye, Sir, ſays he, you are the very Man I want,—I muſt be a little troubleſome to you for your Advice in an Affair that weighs heavily on my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and a Friend has adviſed me to apply to Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi> for his Opinion.</q>—Upon this, I aſſured him of my Inclination to ſerve him, and as I perceived he had not yet diveſted himſelf of his Diffidence, I begg'd of him to proceed without any farther Ceremony; which he accordingly complied with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>My Name, Sir, reaſſumed the Stranger, is <hi>Oldcaſtle,</hi> of <hi>Oldcaſtle-Hall</hi> in the North of <hi>England,</hi>—nothing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0311400901:193"/>but an Affair of Conſequence ſhould have brought me upwards of two hundred Miles to Town;—I have fetched my eldeſt Son up with me, as I think of putting him to ſomething—a wounded ſharp Boy he is;— he's a Tartar for your <hi>Greek</hi> and your <hi>Latin,</hi> and the beſt Mimick in the World;—Odds my Life, he'd mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick all the Waggoners as he come along the Road, —but that's neither here nor there—I now think it Time, as I told you, to put him to Buſineſs—I have a large Family, and but a finall Eſtate was handed to me by my Anceſtors;—the Land was ſurveyed in the Time of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> and there is juſt the ſame Number of Acres to this Day — I would have my Son be the Firſt of his Family that improved it, and then he may help me to provide for his Brother and Siſters—but look ye, Sir, in this large Town, I am mainly puzzled what to put him to;—I am afraid, I have made ſuch another Journey to <hi>London,</hi> as Sir <hi>Francis Wronghead</hi> in the Play, and unleſs ſome ſuch good Gentleman as you aſſiſts me, I muſt go back in the old ſqueaking Stage-Coach, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing my Buſineſs—if you pleaſe, I'll ſtep and fetch <hi>Dicky,</hi> he's at the <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Gate Inn,</hi> and will be here in a Crack.</q> Here he pauſed for a Reply. As the Matter he conſulted me upon was of no ſmall Importance, I begged Leave to be ſilent for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and promiſed I would give him an Anſwer in this Day's Lucubration. Mr. <hi>Oldcaſtle</hi> was perfectly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and withdrew in the Fullneſs of his Joy, after aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring me, that he would always read my Paper, and that he would leave Orders with the Publiſher to ſend it to his Houſe in the Country every <hi>Saturday</hi> for the future.</p>
                  <p>The Direction of a young Gentleman's Genius to any particular Profeſſion, is a Point of more Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, than perhaps appears to the Inattentive; as to this Step is often to be imputed the Happineſs or
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0311400901:194"/>Miſery of the Perſon in the enſuing Part of his Days. This Circumſtance in Life, is not unlike what we ſee at a Bowling-Green, where, before a Man plays off, he ſhould conſider the Byaſs of his Bowl, and if it is delivered with Judgment, it makes its Way to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined Point; but, if there ſhould be too much Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in the Outſet, or if a proper Degree of Force ſhould be wanting to forward it, it either runs beyond the Mark, or lags in the Middle of its Progreſs. On this Account it is no eaſy Matter to adviſe upon ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate a Point, as I have now to handle.</p>
                  <p>I have conſidered all the Profeſſions, and I really think them very precarious. Many great Eſtates and eminent Titles have been derived from the Law; but it is now reduced to ſuch a State, that without very great Friends, a Perſon poſſeſſed of the Talents of a <hi>Murray,</hi> ſhall never riſe to any Degree of Eminence. With Regard to Phyſick, a Genius may ſpend his Time in ſaving the Lives of Patients in Garrets, and doing real Services to Mankind, without any Emolument to himſelf, while <hi>Doctor Slaughter</hi> puts his Licence to kill in Execution upon Thouſands of his Majeſty's well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed Subjects, and lolls at Eaſe in his Chariot.</p>
                  <p>In the Army, it is to be feared, that Preferment goes more by Intereſt, than Merit: And there is not a Wind that can blow from any Quarter of the Heavens, but fills the Merchant's Imagination with pictured Scenes of Shipwrecks; and while he breaks the Seal of a Letter, he trembles for fear of receiving the News of ſome Correſpondent's Failure. The Stage, indeed, ſeems to be a Place, where Merit meets its Reward, but even there, there are great Diſadvantages; and though a Genius ſhould ſtart up with the Talents of a <hi>Garrick,</hi> and Perſon of a <hi>Barry,</hi> it is odds, but his Eye is one Time or other knock'd out by a well directed Apple.</p>
                  <p>There is, however, a Way of Life, which I cannot help thinking the moſt eligible, and, not to keep the

After mature Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Gentlemen of this Calling ſeem to me to be in Poſſeſſion of greater Advantages than any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the Inconveniences attending them, are not upon a Ballance with the Conveniences.</p>
                  <p>A Gameſter, from a conſtant Habit of venturing large Sums upon the Turning up of a Card, or a Die, acquires that thorough Diſregard for Money, which is ſo much recommended by the Philoſophers. Like <hi>Catiline</hi> in <hi>Salluſt,</hi> he is <hi>alieni appetens, ſui profuſis;</hi> at the ſame Time, that he is deſirous of his Friends Subſtance, he has the Pleaſure of being profuſe in his own private Gratifications. Inſtead of creeping through Life with that Mediocrity of Spirit, which depreſſes the Man of Buſineſs, the Gameſter lives with an Eclat; <hi>Ryan, Venable,</hi> or <hi>Tomkyns,</hi> ſupply him with his Wines, and he is every Hour gaining an Inſight into Men and Manners. As rude Health has too much of the Country in it, and of courſe is not very pleaſing to the Ladies, he acquires by his midnight Vigil, a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid meagre Countenance, which generally denotes an intimate Knowledge of the Town; and while others deceive one another in the Face of Day, a Gameſter has the Modeſty to fly to the Covert of the Night, and, if I may uſe the Poet's Words, <hi>The pale Moon and Stars alone are conſcious of the Theft.</hi> While the Man of Genius is left undiſturbed in his Study, the gay-dreſſed Footman knocks at the Gameſter's Doos, and leaves the agreeable Card to invite him to my Lady <hi>Bragwell</hi>'s. There he has an Opportunity of carrying on a Deſign upon a Lady's Money and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue at the ſame Time, and if he can once contrive to get her in his Books, he ſinds it no difficult Matter to make her give <hi>perſonal</hi> Security, and when once a Woman's Body is mortgaged, there is no Equity of Redemption.</p>

                  <p>LATELY arrived in this Town from <hi>Paris,</hi> the <hi>Marquis de Fourberie,</hi> well known to many of the Nobility and Gentry, who have been in Foreign Parts. He is well verſed in all the different Branches of Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he teaches how to play the whole Game in a Month's Time.</p>
                  <p>He has taken an Apartment for this Purpoſe in the <hi>Hay-market,</hi> where he reads Lectures every Day in the Week, except <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> when he attends the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the City, at his Room near the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> where he will let any young Prentice or City Smart into the Secret, without Hindrance of Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>He has taught, ſince his coming here, ſeveral Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of both Sexes, and it was he inſtructed the <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramouch,</hi> who carried off fifteen hundred Pounds from the laſt Maſquerade.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen and Ladies may learn in a private Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without being overſeen by Strangers while Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for the more expeditiouſly compleating them, there is a Set to practiſe from Seven in the Evening till Three in the Morning.</p>
                  <p>As ſeveral Perſons have, and do think ſtill, that it is impoſſible to learn without going into Company, he thinks proper to inform them of his Method for that Purpoſe. He firſt teaches the Scholar the Shuffle, then the different Methods of Cutting; next he explains his
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0311400901:197"/>Rules, by the Aſſiſtance of ſecond-hand Cards; when the Party is ſo qualified, he makes his own Family ſit down with them, where they play moſt of the Games in Vogue; after the Perſon has learned in this Manner, which he or ſhe may do in a very ſhort Time, he dares anſwer for them, they will be qualified to play in any genteel Company whatever.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>ERISION and Contempt have been for many Ages the Portion of moſt Authors, whom Rank in Life, or Superiority of Abilities, have not eminently raiſed above the common Herd of their Fraternity; and the Name of Poet, in every Company where the Word is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0311400901:198"/>is ſure to excite ludicrous Ideas of Garrets, unwaſhed Shirts, and unpaid Taylors. By theſe Means it has obtained, that younger Brothers had rather take a Piſtol or a Pack of Cards in their Hands to raiſe a Livelihood, than endeavour to help out the Year's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Exertion of their Talents; dreading the Infamy of Wit, more than any other Imputation, that can be fixed upon their Characters.</p>
                  <p>This Effect is not produced without a Concurrence of many efficient Cauſes, among which the principal one is, the known Poverty of the Generality of the Tribe that write; and among all the Inconveniences of Indigence, it has been well ſaid, that there is not a greater Hardſhip, than that Ridicule, which it brings upon thoſe who labour under its Laſh.</p>

                  <p>The Belly has been often called the Teacher of Art, and the Inſpirer of Wit; but, I apprehend, this Maxim can only be underſtood of a full Belly.</p>

                     <hi>Horace</hi> was warmed with good Cheer, when he calls out to <hi>Bacchus</hi> to ſpare him, ſays <hi>Juvenal;</hi> and the ſame Author adds, with an elegant Vein of Pleaſantry, that fine Writing is the Production of an exalted Mind, free from the Sollicitude of procuring a Blanket; and that if <hi>Virgil</hi> wanted a Lodging and a Boy to attend him, the Snakes would fall from the Fury, which he ſo admirably deſcribes, and the Trumpet would not ſound to War with ſo ſhrill a Clangor.

                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0311400901:199"/>It is not therefore to be wondered, that Poverty ſhould diminiſh the Poet's Luſtre, ſince it not only renders him an Object of Contempt, but extinguiſhes the Fire of his Genius; and ſuch is the Fate or Perverſeneſs of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, that, to Circumſtances, which they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, they are induſtrious to add many of their own creating; ſo true is the Saying of Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> that wherever Wit is, it is always contriving its own Ruin. The Race of Writers are extremely iraſcible, prone to Malice and Envy towards the Man, whom they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in Poſſeſſion of Fame, and, inſtead of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to equal him with an honeſt Emulation, their Aim is, to ſnatch the Laurel from his Brow, or if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach it, to wither it on his Head by the bitter Blaſts of Calumny and Detraction. <hi>Voltaire</hi> delivers himſelf on this Topic with ſo much Delicacy and good Senſe, that I ſhall here tranſlate the Paſſage. <q>It is a Diſgrace, <hi>ſays he,</hi> to the human Mind, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of Letters ſhould be infeſted with perſonal Reſentments, private Cabals, and mean Intrigues, which ſhould only ſubſiſt among the Slaves of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. What Advantage can accrue to Authors from this Civil War? Their Animoſities have no other Tendency, than to depreciate a Profeſſion, which it is in their Power to render reſpectable. Why ſhould the Art of thinking finely, the greateſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Man can ſhare from Heaven, become an Object of Ridicule? It is really hard, that Men of Genius ſhould render themſelves, by their mutual Invectives, the Sport of Pools, and inſtead of being revered as the Maſters and Inſtructors of the Public, turn out the Buffoons and Zanies of the Town.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another Reaſon, which contributes ſtrongly to bring a Diſreputation upon Poets, and that is, their mean and proſtitute Servility to a Set of Men, whom they call their Patrons. Theſe Gentlemen are for the moſt Part eager after Praiſe, and careleſs of the Means,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0311400901:200"/>by which they might obtain an honeſt Fame; hence the <hi>Parnaſſian</hi> Incenſe is extremely grateful, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore profuſely offered up by every ſcribbling Fool, who vainly thinks to wriggle himſelf into Preferment. But the Misfortune is, that what happens in this Caſe is not anſwerable to the Writer's Intention; his Patron plumes himſelf upon the imputed Accompliſhments, and glows with Rapture and Self Admiration, while for the Bard he feels no Paſſion but Contempt, and the reſt of the World with Pleaſure behold Infamy and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Rewards of Venality and Proſtitution.</p>
                  <p>As I have always entertained great good Wiſhes for the Gentlemen of the Quill, I have deviſed a Method, by the Obſervance of which, they will be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve, in ſome Meaſure, the Honour of their Calling, and obviate that Torrent of Contumely, which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent bears hard upon them.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Place, I would have them frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate, that Fortune is only the Deity of Fools; and, if ſhe has not been favourable to them, they had better enjoy a virtuous Independence in private, than by an ambitious Poverty, bring themſelves under the Contempt and Ridicule of the Affluent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Inſtead of waſting Paper in mutual Calumny and Detraction, I would recommend to them to vent their Anger upon the Critics or the <hi>Male-voli;</hi> a Species of People highly prejudicial to the Cauſe of Literature, on whom no Severities can be too hard, as it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that not one of the Race about Town at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is any way fit for the Province he has uſurped; a total Ignorance of the learned Languages, and a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable want of Taſte, together with a plentiful Share of Spleen and Ill-nature, being the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Characteriſtics of the whole Tribe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> I would adviſe my Brother. Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to diſpenſe their Panegyric with a little more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and always with an Eye to Truth; from whence<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0311400901:201"/>it will follow, that they will find themſelves more court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Patrons, and their Butlers will the more readily condeſcend to hear them from the Side-Board. <hi>To maintain a Poet's Dignity and Eaſe,</hi> is a beautiful Sentiment of Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> and his Life and Manners ſhew that he carried it from Theory into Fractice. Who is not delighted to hear him declare with a noble Pride?
<q>
                        <l>Enough for half the greateſt of theſe Days,</l>
                        <l>To 'ſcape my Cenſure, not expect my Praiſe.</l>
                     </q> Whenever I reflect upon the Conduct of that great Genius, I find it hard to determine within myſelf, which holds moſt of Admiration, the Fineneſs of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and the Elegance of his Poetry, or that Grace of Character, and that unproſtituted, dignified In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, which will always do Honour to the Man. Doctor <hi>Swift</hi> likewiſe, with leſs Delicacy of Manners, jealouſly preſerved his own Reſpect; and ſure I am, that the Writings of theſe two great Authors, though they have both exquiſite Finiſhings in their Kind, have always received an additional Luſtre from the ſelf-created Importance of their Characters.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is not a Pleaſure, which thrills through the tender Nerve of Imagination, but what receives additional Delight from numberleſs adventitious Circumſtances. To the <hi>Aſſociation of Ideas,</hi> explained by Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> may alſo be added the <hi>Aſſociation of Paſſions,</hi> which recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0311400901:203"/>awaken each other, and agitate the Mind with their mixed Operation. Thus the primary Effect, which any Object or Landſkip may have on a Perſon's Taſte, is heightened and enlarged beyond its Bounds; a Recollection of collateral Images ſtarts upon the Fancy, the Paſſions pour in their auxiliar Influence, and our Joy is encreaſed by ſeveral Senſations at once; like a River, which admits at different Inlets the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary Illapſe of ſeveral leſſer Streams, and thence ſwelled above its Banks, diſpenſes Verdure and Fertility to all the Country round. That this is the Caſe in many Situations of the Mind, will be obvious to any Body, that will but turn his Eyes inwards, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is not more ſo in any one Inſtance, than the Joy we ſeel from the Opening of the Spring.</p>
                  <p>In my Opinion, we are not acquainted with a more complicated Pleaſure: our Love of Novelty, which is a leading Principle in the Heart of Man, implanted in us for the moſt benevolent Purpoſes by the Author of our Frame, is particularly gratified at this Seaſon of the Year; the Appearance, which Things aſſume, is not only pleaſing to us on Account of its natural Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but alſo from its Newneſs to the Eye. During the Winter, all Nature ſeems to ſuffer a melancholy Diſtreſs; the animal Creation droops, their Spirits ſeem ſunk into dumb Deſpair, and we read their languid Situation in the mute imploring Eye; the vegetable World ſeems alſo tending to Decay, and a general Scene of Calamity overſpreads the Face of Nature. From this State to ſee gradually a new Creation emerging, and every Thing reviving with renovated Vigour, cannot fail of pleaſing our Imagination; the whole Race of animal Life feels the genial Influence of the ſoft Seaſon; from a Turbulence of Clouds, and all the Inclemencies of the Elements, the Scene is ſhifted to enlivening Suns, blue Skies, Hills cloathed with Verdure, imbowering
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0311400901:204"/>Shades, refreſhing Streams, and the Harmony of the Grove.</p>
                  <p>The learned Reader will perceive with what Elegance <hi>Virgil</hi> has deſcribed this vernal Delight in the Words of my Motto. The Paſſage, from whence I have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected theſe Lines, is carried on with an Air of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm; he ſeems particularly fond of this Seaſon, and the whole is cloſed with a moral Reflection on the Providence of the ſupreme Being, who placed this Part of the Year, as a Medium, to render the Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from intenſe Cold to the Heat of the Summer leſs perceptible to our Conſtitutions. There are many ſhort Sketches of this Nature in the ſame Author; we frequently find him caſting a ſide Glance this Way; and, I will venture to ſay, every Reader of Taſte muſt have been greatly delighted with theſe Bye-views; as on a Road the tranſient Opening of an agreeable Proſpect is always acceptable to the Traveller. <hi>Horace</hi> is alſo happy when giving a Deſcription of the Spring; and <hi>Milton,</hi> the great Father of the Sublime in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poeſy, has in many Places touched it with great Delicacy. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome of the moſt beautiful Imagery in his Poem is to be found in the ſofter Paintings of this Nature, which he has ſo often taken Occaſion to introduce.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the obvious Pleaſures of this Seaſon, already mentioned, there is another Circumſtance, which ſtill renders it more delightful; the Spring, more particularly than any other Time of the Year, is the Seaſon of Love. At this Juncture we feel the Sun warm at our Hearts; young Health ſmiles in the Virgin's Eye; the Morn or Evening Walks affords Senſations unfelt before; a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stillneſs runs o'er the Faculties of the Mind, and every Thing conſpires to fill the Heart, with what the Poet calls, <hi>the Spirit of Love and amorous Delight.</hi> By Love, I would not be ſuppoſed to mean a mere groſs Impulſe of Paſſion, but that Elegance of Deſire, that Refinement of Taſte, which diſtinguiſhes the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0311400901:205"/>and never fails of being acceptable to the amiable Sex.</p>
                  <p>Whatever may be rattled over a Bottle at a Tavern, we are obliged to the Ladies for the moſt valuable Gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Lives; and after all our high-boaſted Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and our ſuperior Abilities, to them it is owing that our Manners become more gentle, and our Sentiments acquire a finer Poliſh. Our Looks and Geſtures aſſume from them a molder Air, our Paſſions ſoften into Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Joy; and the Man, who has uſed himſelf to this agreeable Converſe, is acquainted with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Delicacies in his Amuſements, and ſeveral Elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in his Way of thinking, to which vulgar Souls are abſolutely Strangers.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of expatiating further on this Subject, I ſhall here inſert a Copy of Verſes, which were communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to me by an ingenious Gentleman, whom I am proud to call my Friend. The candid Reader, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade myſelf, will be pleaſed with the Peruſal; and the ſmall Critics, who buzz about the <hi>Gray's-Inn Journal,</hi> may amuſe themſelves with conſidering, whether the Lines ſhould be called, Ode, Song, Paſtoral, or Elegy, and whether they ſufficiently expreſs the Tenderneſs of Love, and the Proceſs of the Paſſion, with its ſeveral ſweet Viciſſitudes.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is with unſpeakable Pleaſure I have obſerved for a conſiderable Time paſt, that thoſe unhappy Diviſions, which have been the Bane of Society, ever ſince the late Commotions in the North, are in a great Meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled; at leaſt, ſo far, as to make an Intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween People of different political Sentiments, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impracticable. The Diſtinction of <hi>Whig,</hi> or <hi>Jacobite,</hi> ſeems to be at preſent thought not eſſentially neceſſary towards conſtituting a good Companion; and the Word HONEST appears to have acquired a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0311400901:209"/>Signification; inſomuch that, whenever we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour a Man with that Appellation, it is generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that we mean ſomething more, than a Perſon who is ready to drink a certain Set of Toaſts. In ſhort, the Enthuſiaſm of Party, in this Reſpect, is ſo far abated, that one may ſpend a chearful Evening with ſome of the moſt ſanguine Friends to the Government, without dedicating a ſingle Glaſs to the Memory of King <hi>William;</hi> and I have more than once, within theſe laſt ſix Months, ſat with ſome reputed Well-wiſhers to the exiled Family, without being under a Neceſſity of ungartering my Stockings, and pulling off my Wig, at every Return of the Bottle. But, alas! what avails this Coalition? The Spirit of Party is ſo intimately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven in the Conſtitution of an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> that all Attempts to extinguiſh it muſt inevitably fail of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: It may indeed be diverted, but will not admit of being eradicated.</p>
                  <p>The Truth of this Obſervation is ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, by the two powerful Factions, which now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite this great Metropolis.</p>
                  <p>I could wiſh for the Pen of <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> in order to trace the Riſe and Progreſs of thoſe fatal Diſſenſions, which ſow Diſcord in Families, make Breaches among Friends, embitter Society, and, if not timely reſtrained, threaten Danger to the State.</p>
                  <p>The Reader, I believe, has anticipated me, and plainly ſees, that I can mean no other, than the Sects, diſtinguiſhed by the Denomination of <hi>Garrickeans</hi> and <hi>Barryiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſeveral Pretenſions of the Theatrical Leaders, from whom the Names of Diſtinction juſt mentioned are derived, are ſo extremely difficult to be adjuſted, that two Perſons can hardly be found, within the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who perſectly agree in their Way of thinking upon this Head: And as the amiable Sex generally ſupport, with great Impetuoſity, their
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0311400901:210"/>favourite Principles, it is inconceivable to thoſe, who have not had Opportunity of obſerving it, what Feuds and Animoſities prevail among the female Partizans of theſe Heroes.</p>
                  <p>I was lately preſent at a Controverſy between two Ladies, who had adopted oppoſite Sentiments, the one being a <hi>Garrickean,</hi> and the other a <hi>Barryiſt.</hi> The Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in Form—the <hi>Garrickean</hi> inſiſting upon it, that ſhe did not like <hi>Barry;</hi> and the <hi>Barryiſt</hi> proteſting with equal Emphaſis, that ſhe could not ſo highly admire <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>—Thus mutual Contradiction being given, the Debate ſoon grew warm, and the <hi>Garrickean</hi> Lady enforced her Opinion with great Vehemence: <q>There is ſomething ſo clever, ſomething ſo lively, ſomething ſo I don't know how in <hi>Garrick</hi>—And his Eyes ſparkle ſo, that, to be ſure, he is the ſweeteſt Creature in the World.</q>—Her Antagoniſt withſtood this Torrent of Eloquence, and with no leſs Energy replied,— <q>Nay, Madam, if you talk of Eyes, nobody can ſay, but <hi>Barry</hi> has as lovely Eyes as ever were ſeen—Then he is ſo tall, and ſo fine a Man, that, Lord bleſs me! there is no Compariſon—I am ſure, <hi>Garrick</hi> can't make Love ſo well—come, now, you muſt give that up.—Not I, upon my Honour, Ma'em, reſumes the <hi>Garrickean,</hi> why ſhould I give it up? All the Gentlemen, and you muſt allow they know beſt, ſay, <hi>Garrick</hi> is the fineſt <hi>Romeo.</hi>
                     </q>—The Weight of this Reaſoning piqued the <hi>Barryiſt,</hi> and ſhe exclaimed, with no ſmall Appearance of Indignation—<q>Pſhaw! what ſignifies what the Men ſay? I don't mind it a Farthing;—they envy the dear Man, becauſe he is ſo handſome.</q>—The Earneſtneſs and Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with which this was delivered, excited a general Laugh, and the Ladies had Prudence enough to ſuſpend the Conteſt for that Evening; but I have been ſince informed, that they renewed it the next Day with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled Vigour, and proceeded ſo far, as to uſe ſome<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0311400901:211"/>certain Figures of Speech, which are thought not quite conſiſtent with female Delicacy.</p>
                  <p>A wide Breach enſued between the Diſputants, in Conſequence of this Diſagreement, which was in a few Days happily healed, by the Mediation of ſome Friends; and the Ladies now viſit as uſual, but have obliged themſelves in the moſt ſolemn Manner, for their mutual Quiet, never to mention, for the future, the Names of <hi>Garrick</hi> and <hi>Barry</hi> in the Company of each other.</p>
                  <p>I have only related this Affair, as a ſlight Inſtance of the unhappy Effects attending our Party-Diviſions. That they are productive of the greateſt Uneaſineſs in the Conjugal State, is ſo very notorious, that People of different Ways of thinking ſeldom chuſe to engage with each other; being aware, that Feuds and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents muſt be unavoidable, when Man and Wife <hi>do not go the ſame Way.</hi> An intimate Acquaintance of mine, who is ſtrongly in the <hi>Garrickean</hi> Intereſt, paid his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to a very agreeable, and every-way-accompliſh'd young Lady; but a violent <hi>Barryiſt.</hi> The young Couple liked one another perfectly well, and there appeared no reaſonable Objection to the Match, but the Difference of Principles.</p>
                  <p>This, however, was an Obſtacle not eaſily to be got over. The Relations on both Sides had ſeveral Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and many Difficulties aroſe in ſettling this Point, which was at laſt adjuſted by a Compromiſe. The Lawyer, who was employed to draw the Articles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Directions to inſert a Clauſe, importing, that all the Boys born of that Marriage ſhould be bred up <hi>Garrickeans,</hi> and the Girls <hi>Barryiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reader, I believe, is ſurprized, that I have not, in this Diſſertation upon Parties, taken any Notice of the <hi>Quiniſts,</hi> a Faction, which, in its Time, has been by no Means contemptible, whether we conſider the Bulk or Quality of the Leaders. The Reaſon is—I have obſerved, that this Party is conſiderably declined,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0311400901:212"/>ſince the Abdication of their Monarch; moſt of them having ſubſcribed to the Revolution, which took Place in <hi>Goodman</hi>'s-<hi>Fields</hi> in the Year Forty-two; and thoſe few, who ſtill continue attached to this Cauſe, being old Men, from whom no Diſturbance can be expected in the female World.</p>
                  <p>That theſe Heart-burnings threaten Danger to the State, I think is very obvious. The Buſineſs of the Theatres is almoſt finiſhed, and, it is expected, that both Houſes will be prorogued in a few Days, when many of the Members will go into the Country, and moſt unqueſtionably excite a Party-Spirit, where-ever they fix. We ſhall hear from one Town, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are divided into <hi>Marriſts</hi> and <hi>Scraſiſts;</hi> from another, that the <hi>Uſheriſts</hi> have got the upper Hand, and the Favourers of <hi>Raftor</hi> do not dare to ſhew their Faces. What Influence theſe Diviſions may have upon the approaching Election, I leave to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Power to conſider, not doubting but they will thank me for this friendly Intimation, and make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>From this fair and candid Repreſentation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Parties among us, many uſeful Reflections may be drawn, which, as they are extremely obvious, the Reader's good Senſe will undoubtedly ſuggeſt to him. I might here diſmiſs my Subject in the Words of <hi>Horace,</hi>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0311400901:213"/>there is nothing I ſo ardently deſire, as an Union of all true Friends to our Theatrical Entertainments, in order to rouze the Directors of the <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> and <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Companies from their Lethargy, and make them ſenſible, that though the Public have a violent Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite for Plays, and can feed on a <hi>Romeo</hi> and <hi>Juliet</hi> thirty or forty Times in a Seaſon, yet they would be glad of a little Variety—This ſurely they may modeſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as the heavy Subſidies for the Maintenance of theſe States are raiſed entirely upon them.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Sentiment, which is very beautifully expreſſed in the Words of my Motto, grew naturally out of the Converſation, at the laſt Meeting of our Club; and to enforce it ſtill further, Mr. <hi>Gulliver,</hi> who then occupied the Chair, produced a Stricture of oriental Hiſtory, which, he believed, would impreſs the Reflection deeper on the Mind, as it carried with it the Admonitions of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; and therefore, as ſuch, I ſhall recommend it to the Peruſal of my Readers.</p>
                  <p>In the Chronicles of the Sultans of the Eaſt, it is recorded, that when <hi>Othman</hi> held the Rank of Viſier under a Prince of the <hi>Saſſanian</hi> Race, and by his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Councils added Security, Luſtre, and Dignity to the Throne, his Son <hi>Muſtapha</hi> diſplay'd in his early Bloom all the Virtues which could endear him to the beſt of Fathers, and render him amiable in the Eyes of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. <hi>Achmet</hi> the Hermit, who had been called forth from his Retreat, in order to attend the Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his tender Mind, had taken care to ſeaſon him with Religion, and to inflame his young Imagination with the Deſire of a fair and honeſt Fame. The Sage well knew that this Propenſity would be a ſtrong ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0311400901:216"/>Aid to the native Beauty of Virtue, would warm and cheriſh his native Goodneſs, and invigorate the Exertion of it. Accordingly <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſoon drew the Eyes of all Men upon him; his Conduct was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Emanation of Benevolence, and in his Boſom glowed that intenſe heroic Ardour, which ſoon after diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed him in the Field of glorious Danger. In a ſhort Time he arrived to the higheſt Degree of Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the Sultan heaped Favours on him in what might be called a Profuſion of Liberality, had not his Merit daily deſerved it from him. He was delegated with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Authority to command the Armies of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and from the Confines of <hi>Perſia</hi> to the <hi>Indian</hi> Ocean, he ſoon reduced every Thing under Subjection. Though he was yet green in Years, each Tongue was mute in his Preſence, and before him every Eye looked down with a Kind of reverential Awe; he loved the Prince, who raiſed him to this State of Elevation, and by the Gentleneſs of his Manners he ſoftened that Envy, which might otherwiſe ariſe againſt the Luſtre of his Glory.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was conſtantly reaping freſh Laurels, and gratifying his inſatiable Love of Fame by daily Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions of Glory, his Father at home met with a Reverſe of Fortune. <hi>Othman</hi> poſſeſſed all thoſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which ſhone forth in his Son with a more ſtriking Luſtre; and he vainly imagined, that in a corrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Court, he could be great and good with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity. But the Storm now gathered heavily in Clouds around him, and the turbulent Tempeſts of Jealouſy, Ambition, Hatred, and Revenge environed him with a Whirlwind more dreadful than that which tears up whole Continents of Sand in the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia.</hi> The grand Apartments in his Houſe, which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly filled with a Band of Courtiers, were now empty and forlorn; he was diveſted of all his Honours; his Truſt was taken away from him, and, after a Series
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0311400901:217"/>of Years ſpent in the Service of his Prince, he was ſtripped of every Thing but his paternal Eſtate; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he withdrew to ſhelter himſelf from an ungrateful World.</p>
                  <p>In this Retirement, <hi>Othman,</hi> what were your Thoughts, what were your Senſations? The Sun uſhered in a Day void of Occupation, and the Night a Train of reſtleſs Dreams. At length his Conſtitution received ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Strokes from a conſtant Succeſſion of corroſive Cares, that he languiſhed under the Preſſure, and his Soul ſickened to Deſperation. A gloomy viſionary Light obſcured his Eyes with dim Suffuſion, and he beheld with Joy the approaching Sunſet of his Days. As he lay languiſhing on the Bed of Sickneſs, he gave Orders, that his Son might be informed of his Situation. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> immediately quitted his high Command, flew to his dying Father's languid Arms, and in a Guſh of Tears embraced his agonizing Body. <hi>Othman,</hi> with what little Strength he had left, raiſed his Head, and fixing his faded Eye-balls on him, "My Son, ſaid he," hear my Words: <q>You have beheld your Father in the Sunſhine of Proſperity; you now behold him in the laſt Extreme of Miſery. I am fallen a Prey to the Intrigues of ill-deſigning Men;—the Angel of Death now hovers over his Victim; then liſten to my laſt Directions;—Avoid pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Honours;—fly from Courts, as from the Monſters of the Deſart; be not miſled by a vain Love of Fame and an unavailing Popularity;—Virtue is its own Reward;—then let your Happineſs be fixed in your own Mind, independent of external Objects;—de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Opinions of Mankind, which are always fluctuating and uncertain as the <hi>Caſpian,</hi> when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with Tempeſts.—For the Remainder of your Days have a Contempt for Fame;—it will only lead you into a Series of Toils for an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful World.—Steal through Life imperceptible, like
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0311400901:218"/>the Path of the Arrow, which leaves no Trace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it;—let your Moderation ſhade you from Envy, and look down upon the Giddy.</q>—</p>
                  <p>He could no more; his Lot for Eternity was caſt, and he expired. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> wept in Bitterneſs of Anguiſh over the beſt of Fathers; he treaſured up his Precepts in the inmoſt Receſſes of his Soul, and inſtantly began to conform his Conduct to the Practice of them. His Dignities and Honours he reſigned forthwith, and in the Sullenneſs of his Soul he locked himſelf from the World. His Houſe no longer reſounded with Singers and with Minſtrels; no longer did Amber and Aloes adminiſter their rich Perfumes; the Vaſes of Agate, which in his Father's Time overflowed with all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Liquors of the Eaſt, lay tumbled into an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded Heap; and even the Hand of Charity, which was before ſtretched out at his Gate, was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed and frozen up. Echo no longer repeated his Praiſes, and Scandal began to accumulate Diſgrace upon him. This he heard, and he deſpiſed the Rumour; the many Leſſons given him by his Tutor were now totally forgot; the Seeds of Virtue lay dormant in his Breaſt, and his Love of Fame was now entirely extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, nay, the very Thoughts of it were loathſome to him, inſomuch that, to leave no room for a Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that he had any the leaſt Regard for Popularity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, he would often ſay to himſelf, <q>That the World may ſee how much I am above any Notices it may take of me, I muſt not be guilty of a ſingle good Action.</q>—By imperceptible Degrees this Turn of Mind ſettled into a fixed Inſenſibility to all Dignity of Character, and on the Contempt of <hi>Fame</hi> was grafted a Contempt of <hi>Virtue.—Muſtapha! Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha!</hi> you thundered at the Head of Armies; whole Nations obeyed your Voice; and now, how altered! relaxed and enfeebled you groan in Anguiſh, reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HILE <hi>Muſtapha</hi> thus dozed away his Hours ingloriouſly inactive, the Tidings of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation were wafted abroad by every Breeze, and at length reached the Ears of <hi>Achmet</hi> in his Hermitage. The venerable old Man heard the Story with the ſevereſt Compunction; his Heart was appalled within him; as if the Hand of Death had ſmote him, he ſat down in his Haram, but there no Angel whiſpered to his Meditation; no Inſpiration bore his Thoughts aloft to the prime Source of Being; <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Shame depreſſed the Swellings of Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, and quite extinguiſhed the pious Fervor of his Soul. He was tormented with the Reflection, that ſo noble a Youth ſhould ſtop ſhort in the Middle of his Career, and check ſuch excellent Propenſities, as he knew were lodged in his Breaſt. At length he aroſe, and taking his Staff in his Hand, he extinguiſhed the Light
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0311400901:222"/>which burned before him, and ſet out on a Journey over the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and in a ſhort Time arrived at his Pupil's Habitation.</p>
                  <p>It was with Difficulty he gained Admiſſion; but the Gates were no ſooner opened for him, than he went ſtreight to his young Pupil's Apartment. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was reclined upon a Sofa, his Looks ſullenly fixed on the Ground, and his Mind hardening into Inſenſibility. <hi>Achmet</hi> eagerly preſented himſelf before him. His Eyes were vivid and piercing, though the Quickneſs of their Luſtre was ſomewhat diminiſhed by the galling Effuſion of Tears, which this unexpected Shock had coſt him. The Winter of Age had ſhed its Snows upon his Head and Beard and the lively Expreſſion of Paſſions, which throbbed in mingled Tumult about his Heart, rendered him an alarming Object to his Pupil. A conſcious Bluſh diffuſed itſelf over his Face, at Sight of the hoary Sage; and both their Senſations being too big for Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, their Tongues were ſuſpended, and their Eyes overflowing diſcourſed for a while in the moſt eloquent pathetic Silence. At length <hi>Achmet</hi> faintly uttered <hi>"Muſtapha!"</hi> and a Guſh of Tears choaked up the reſt. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> at this was covered with Confuſion, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to break from him; but the palſied Nerves of the venerable Hermit felt a Renovation of Strength from the glowing Purpoſe of his Soul, and laying faſt hold of his Pupil, he exclaimed, <q>You ſhall not put me from you; in me your Genius now alarms you; by me it means to rouze you from your Lethargy, and awaken the dying Embers of that amiable Fire, which formerly kindled all your Spirits, in thoſe happier Days, when my Inſtructions were refreſhing to your Ears, as the Morning Dews to the Verdure, which cloaths the Fields of <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> But now, how art thou fallen! each finer Principle of Virtue is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and you are even deaf to the Voice of Fame, that ſweeteſt Muſic to a virtuous Ear. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0311400901:223"/>thee at once from the Dreams of Folly and over-weening Pride, in which thy Soul is now ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhly immerſed, read there that myſtic Truth, which a <hi>Genie</hi> put into my Hand, in an Hour of Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when my Thoughts were ſwelled with ſublime Ideas of the Diſpenſations of him, who is in the Heaven of Heavens, and whoſe wonder-working Hand launched forth the Planets into the illimitable Void, and ſtill continueth to produce the Harmony of the phyſical and moral World by various Secrets and indirect Cauſes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Heart of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> was alarmed, and he read as follows. <q>When VIRTUE was ſent down from the third Heaven to reſtrain the irregular Paſſions of Mankind, the Dignity of her Mien and Beauty of her Aſpect were ſufficiently attractive to make her admired of all Beholders. But ſuch is the Depravity of human Nature, that theſe Allurements ſoon began to loſe of their Influence, and VIRTUE ſhortly finding herſelf neglected and forlorn, returned to her celeſtial Manſion, in order to prefer her Complaint againſt the Sons of Men. There ſhe remonſtrated, that blind Mankind was not only inſenſible to her perſonal Charms, but alſo deaf to the Promiſe of Rewards, which were to be diſpenſed to her Votaries in a future State of Exiſtence. Though this was a ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Wrath, yet ſuch was the ſupreme Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that VIRTUE was again ſent down upon her Miſſion; and the better to ſtrengthen her Intereſts, FAME was ordered to attend her, with an high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to diſpenſe temporary Retributions even on this Side of the Grave. As ſoon as they reached the Verge of human Nature, FAME blew aloft her ſilver Trumpet, and an inſtantaneous Glow was kindled in all Hearts. Wherever VIRTUE was cheriſhed, FAME purſued her Footſteps; and if Court was any where made to her alone, ſhe was ſure to withold her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0311400901:224"/>until the Candidates found Means, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of VIRTUE, to inſinuate themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her good Graces. By this amiable Union Mankind were reſtrained within juſt Reſtrictions, and were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to a Series of meritorious Actions, either by an Attachment to the Allurements of VIRTUE, or from a Deſire of obtaining the Applauſe of FAME. But ſhort is the Duration of all ſublunary Things. FAME, in her Turn, began to ſhare the ſame Fate, that VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUE had met before her; the Appetites of Men were now well-nigh ſated, and the Muſick of Applauſe no longer ſounded grateful to the Ear. It was obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that wherever ſhe met with a Repulſe, VIRTUE was ſoon known to follow her, and it very rarely happened that ſhe remained with above one or two in an Age without her Attendant FAME. In Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Time Matters were carried to that Extremity, that this celeſtial Pair were tired of their Pilgrimage, and wearied out at length they reſolved to offer up a joint Petition to be recalled. They therefore flew to the Throne of him who is in the Heaven of Heavens, and humbly urged, that it was in vain for them to ſojourn any longer upon Earth, as deluded Mankind was now entirely ſeduced by the ſpurious Ornaments of the Monſter VICE, which had iſſued out of the Regions of Darkneſs, and ſet up in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all that VIRTUE and FAIR FAME could inſpire. In this Inſtance again the tender Care of Heaven was eminently diſplayed, and theſe two radiant Beings were a ſecond Time commanded to return to Earth, with Directions, that, however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved the Appetites of Men might be, they ſhould perſiſt in an unremitted Courſe of Endeavours for their Service. But the more effectually to ſtrengthen their Cauſe, a Fiend called INFAMY was ordered to iſſue forth from the unhallowed Cell of VICE, and to adhere cloſe to her, whatſoever Way ſhe ſhould bend her Courſe.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0311400901:225"/>It was likewiſe ordained that whoever ſhould betray a Diſregard for VIRTUE and HONEST FAME, ſhould be branded by INFAMY, and that theſe two ſhould thus continue to wander among Mankind, until the Angel of Death ſhould walk forth by the Command of the ALMIGHTY, and ſweep the whole Race from the Face of the Earth, to receive that Retribution of Rewards and Puniſhments, which may be due to their VIRTUE or VICE.</q>

                     <hi>Muſtapha</hi> now perceived the Miſts of Error clearing away from before his Underſtanding; he embraced <hi>Achmet,</hi> and poured out the Effuſions of his Gratitude for thus recalling him to the Taſk of Virtue, whoſe Strength conſiſts in Activity. He acknowledged that the Tranſition is eaſy from a Contempt of Fame to an equal Diſregard for the Virtues that deſerve it; and the Name of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> during the Remainder of the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of this Reign makes a diſtinguiſhed Figure, and it is ſaid that he cloſed a Life of VIRTUE with Honour and Renown.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T occurred to me the other Day, as I was ſitting in my Study, that I had contracted a very heavy Debt, on the Score of Viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and being willing to diſcharge the Demands upon me as expeditiouſly as poſſible. I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to dedicate an entire Evening to the Settlement of this Account. I accordingly writ my Name upon about fifteen Pieces of Card, and fallied out upon this important Buſineſs. At moſt of the Places, where I
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0311400901:227"/>called, I had no Occaſion to alight, but diſcharged my Obligation, by delivering to the Footman at the Door one of the Tokens of modern Friendſhip above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; I had, however, the good Fortune of finding ſome of my <hi>Friends</hi> at home, who received me with prodigious Affability; and after deſiring mine, and giving me their Opinion of the important Diſputes concerning <hi>Elizabeth Canning</hi> and <hi>Mary Squires,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed me with great Politeneſs.</p>
                  <p>I was not a little fatigued with the ſucceſſive Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame flimzy Chit-chat in every Company where I was admitted, and quite diſguſted with ſo trifling a Manner of ſpending my Time, I was juſt going to direct the Coachman to drive home, when I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that I had not ſeen my Friend Mr. <hi>Diſcount</hi> of <hi>Cateaton-ſtreet,</hi> ſince the Lord Mayor's Day.</p>
                  <p>This determined me to ſteer my Courſe towards the City, and my good Genius prevailed ſo far, that I found Mr. <hi>Diſcount,</hi> his Lady and two Daughters, at home; it being the Day, upon which Mrs. <hi>Diſcount</hi> ſaw Company.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I entered the Room, my old Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſaluted me in a friendly Manner, and aſſured me, that he was glad to ſee me; his Lady, in an ironical Compliment, delivered with a forced Smile, gave me to underſtand, that ſhe was highly ſenſible of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour I did her Family, in condeſcending to come into the City; and the young Ladiès curteſied, and told me, with ſome Appearance of Reſentment, that they were extremely glad to find, that Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi> had not entirely forgot his old Friends.</p>
                  <p>This Reception ſomewhat diſconcerted me; however, I endeavoured to acquit myſelf with the uſual Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuch as—<hi>That I had the greateſt Eſteem for Mr.</hi> Diſcount<hi>'s Family—That Nobody reſpected them more—But that Affairs of Buſineſs had engroſſed my Time—That I ſeldom could command an Hour to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0311400901:228"/>—But that I certainly ſhould not be ſo had a Viſiter for the futurs.</hi>—As ſoon as this preliminary Point was ſettled, Mr. <hi>Diſcount</hi> ſeated me next himſelf, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, aſked me, <q>How Things went at our End of the Town?</q>—<q>What, ſays he, ſhall we have a Lottery, do you think?</q> I was going to anſwer, that I really was not in the Secret of thoſe Schemes, when the eldeſt Miſs <hi>Diſcount</hi> interpoſed, and ſaid, <q>Lord! Papa, do you imagine, that Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himſelf about the Things you talk of in your City Coffee-houſes? What are your Money-Affairs to him?—Have you been at a great many Plays laſt Winter, Mr. <hi>Ranger?</hi>—What do you think of <hi>Foote</hi>'s Farce? I ſaw it the firſt Night—I would not miſs it the firſt Night for any Thing.</q>—</p>
                  <p>As I was meditating an Anſwer, my worthy Friend takes me by the Hand, and exclaims—<q>Heavens! Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> what will this World come to! The young People of this Age, Sir, think of nothing but Diverſions — From Morning to Night, my Ears, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> are dinned with <hi>Garrick</hi> and <hi>Barry,</hi> and Dogs and Monkeys, and <hi>Mother Midnight,</hi> and <hi>Spoona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimo,</hi> and ſuch a Jargon, that one would imagine the Order of Things was inverted</q> — Here the youngeſt Miſs <hi>Diſcount</hi> ſeized the Converſation — <q>Nay, now, Papa, ſays ſhe, becauſe you do not go to thoſe Places yourſelf, you would not have any Body elſe go</q>—<q>That's true <hi>Betty,</hi> replied Mamma: He is a ſtrange Man, to be ſure — Mr. <hi>Diſcount</hi> has no Notion of any Thing genteel — Well, he muſt have his own Way.</q> —</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Diſcount,</hi> without taking Notice of theſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raptions, reſumed his Diſcourſe—<q>Why, Sir, ſays he, this muſt portend ſomething—Certainly a Judgment hangs over the Nation—We ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have another Earthquake at leaſt—You know, the laſt Earthquake was occaſioned by the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0311400901:229"/>immenſe Number of Places of public Entertainment —the Biſhop ſaid ſo in his Letter—do you not remember it, Mr. <hi>Ranger?</hi>
                     </q>—Here a loud Laugh made it unneceſſary for me to reply, and my well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning Friend, intent upon his Subject, continued to animadvert on the Extravagance of the Times— <q>Your Uncle <hi>Caleb,</hi> added he, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> and I uſed frequently to talk over theſe Things together, and we have often lamented the Degeneracy of the Times —We foreſaw, that it muſt end in the Ruin of the Nation — Ay, we foreſaw it a long Time ago— All this Luxury, which has been the Bane of <hi>Old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> has crept in among us ſince the Year Twenty. —Ah! that Year Twenty, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> was a fatal Year—a fatal Year indeed.</q>—Here Miſs <hi>Diſcount</hi> could contain no longer, but broke out, with ſome Warmth—<q>Lord, Papa! You are always bringing up that Year Twenty—How many Hundred Years ago is it, ſince that Year Twenty?—It does not ſignify talking—While People are in the World, they muſt do as other People do, or they had better be out of the World; and one muſt go to public Places, or they will have nothing to talk of—Is it not ſo, Mr. <hi>Ranger?</hi> Come, now, I am ſure you are of my Opinion, an't you?</q>—As I was unwilling to diſoblige either Party in this Diſpute, I replied to the Lady in two Lines of <hi>Prior;</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Seldom your Opinions err,</l>
                        <l>Your Eyes are always in the right.</l>
                     </q> This Topic had, I thought, been purſued rather too far, therefore, I waved the Converſation, and aſked the Ladies, whether they had ſeen Mrs. <hi>Brillant,</hi> ſince her Marriage? To this they all anſwered at once, O yes—Whereupon I took the Liberty to addreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf particularly to Mrs. <hi>Diſcount,</hi> and deſired to know,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0311400901:230"/>whether ſhe did not think her a very fine Woman?— <q>A fine Woman, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> replied ſhe, how can you aſk me ſuch a Queſtion? To be ſure, ſhe is a ſhowy Woman, and ſuch a one as takes with the Men; but you can't call her a fine Woman ſurely. —Then, ſhe wears her Cap ſo horridly; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways overdreſſes herſelf—The Gentlemen, I know, admire her, but I proteſt I cannot ſee for what."— Madam, replied I, I muſt beg Leave to be of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Opinion; in my Eyes, Mrs. <hi>Brillant</hi> appears a very amiable Woman, and it gives me a great deal of Pleaſure, that ſhe is ſo happily married."— O indeed, ſays Miſs <hi>Diſcount,</hi> I believe ſhe is very happy, for ſhe has a very handſome Equipage, and a ſweet Pair of Ear-rings; and then ſhe ſees a vaſt deal of Company—There were ninety Perſons at her laſt Rout—She plays Crown-Whiſt</q>—</p>
                  <p>I could not forbear obſerving, that I was a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, ſo diſcerning a young Lady ſhould eſtimate Mrs. <hi>Brillant</hi>'s Happineſs from the Stake ſhe played for at Whiſt, when to me it appeared, that ſhe poſſeſſed a a more certain Source of Felicity, in the amiable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and polite Accompliſhments of her Huſband— <q>O law! that's true, replied the Ladies, they ſay her Huſband too is a <hi>pretty Man.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We were proceeding farther on this Head, when a thundering Rap was given at the Door, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſignified, that Lady <hi>Portſoken</hi> was coming into the Room. As I thought I had paid a Viſit of a ſufficient Length, I took Advantage of the Alarm given by this City Knight's Lady, and withdrew unnoticed.</p>
                  <p>In my return Home, I could not avoid reflecting on the capricious Notions the female World entertain of Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>To be dreſſed as well as others of the ſame Rank; to be preſent at all public Places, without conſidering the Entertainment in any other Light, than as the Means
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0311400901:231"/>of bringing Company together; to viſit, and be viſited by every one, whom they think it of Conſequence to ſalute at the Playhouſe; to live (if it may be called liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) in a perpetual Courſe of Card-playing; and, to ſum up the whole, to be married to a Man of any Age, Figure or Qualities whatſoever, capable and willing to ſupport all this, in the Opinion of Ninety-nine Females in a Hundred, conſtitutes a happy Woman. I ſhould be perhaps cenſured as a Pedant, if I offended the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of my female Readers, with obſerving, that they degrade the Faculties of the human Soul, by confining the Exerciſe of them within ſuch a Circle of Trifles; but I hope I may be allowed Leave to refer them to the <hi>Spectator,</hi> where they will learn from the elegant Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> that the ſtrongeſt Argument, which can be advanced for the Immortality of the Soul, is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Progreſs of the Mind in the Acquiſition of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>Now, I would ſubmit it to the Candor of my fair Countrywomen, whether their Conduct does not ſubvert the Principles, upon which this polite Philoſopher Reaſons; and tend to eſtabliſh the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that the Souls of Women are mortal.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE of late received ſeveral very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Letters from my Correſpondents, in which they ſtrenuouſly preſs me into the Service of my Country; and though I have always diſclaimed Politics, as a Subject averſe from my Inclinations, theſe Gentlemen are for making a Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of me in my own Deſpite. I muſt own, I am not willing to be thrown off my Byaſs, but when the Act of Parliament in favour of the <hi>Jews</hi> engroſſes ſo much of our Converſation, and has worked all our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into a Ferment, it then becomes the Duty of a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Writer, to make his Bow to the Muſes, and devote one Lucubration to the Happineſs and Welfare of his Countrymen.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have naturally interwoven in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution a peculiar Kind of national Self-Love, and the leaſt Attempt to diſpenſe a Favour to Foreigners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms their Fears, and awakens that Jealouſy which is natural to their very Frame. It is to this we owe the general Diſcontent, which has broke out among all Ranks of People upon the late Occaſion; but that it is owing to a miſtaken Prejudice, I believe, will be manifeſt to any Man that does not ſee Things with the Jaundiced Fye of Party.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſaid, that by this Act we give the Lie to the Scripture, and fly in the Face of a peremptory Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0311400901:234"/>which declares, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fixed Scttlement in any Country, a vagabond Race upon the Face of the Earth. There was a Time when this Objection might be allowed to carry with it ſome Degree of Weight; while Chriſtianity ſubſiſted in this Kingdom, it would have been the groſſeſt Abſurdity to introduce a Bill of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>But the Chriſtian Diſpenſation has entirely diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared from among us, and I believe, in the Memory of the oldeſt Perſon now living no Trace of it can be found; which is, in my Opinion, a concluſive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Favour of this Naturalization Act. Were it any Way inconſiſtent with the Religion now in Faſhion, I perſuade myſelf, it would have met with Oppoſition from a certain Bench in the H — of L —; but as nothing of this Kind was offered, it is to be preſumed, that Judaiſm properly coincides with our preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition both in Church and State; and I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recommend this Doctrine to be preached from the Pulpit, for the better quieting the Minds of Men; and if the Right Reverends would iſſue out Paſtoral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to this Purpoſe, the Remedy would be quicker in its Operation, and the miſtaken Notions, which the common People have imbibed, would the ſooner be effaced.</p>
                  <p>About three Weeks ſince I had Occaſion to take a Boat at <hi>Whitehall</hi> Stairs, in order to go a little Way down the River. We no ſooner put off from Shore, than I perceived the Waterman to be a very ſenſible Fellow, and particularly knowing in Politics. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave him an Opportunity of diſcovering his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Bill in Queſtion, and he diſcuſſed it with great Strength of Lungs, and Vehemence of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <q>D—mn the circumciſed Dogs, ſays he, now they are naturalized, I'll engage we ſhall have them all turn Watermen, and they will have all the Buſineſs of the River to themſelves.</q>—This Story (which
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0311400901:235"/>is really a Matter of Fact) will ſhew what Prejudices are entertained by the common People, who have raiſed the violent Clamour againſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and hence may be inferred that Wiſdom doth not always cry out in the Streets. For my Part, I am perſuaded, when Things are conſidered diſpaſſionately, the Act will bear a different Aſpect in the Eyes of all Men of Senſe. For who have been ſerved by it? Not the poor <hi>Jews,</hi> who are ſtill leſt under the Severity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them, but the rich, who are by this Stroke reſcued from Heaven's Vengeance; and this Regard to the Affluent, and Contempt for the Money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I take to be perfectly conſiſtent with the Genius of a trading Nation; and I am of Opinion that from this Incident, a very uſeful Moral may be enforced, <hi>viz.</hi> that Money cannot only influence ſublunary Things, but alſo ſuperſede the Decrees of Providence; and as I think this Act has given the Nation in general a very great Acceſſion of Credit, Reputation, Honour, and Riches, I ſhould be glad to ſee a further Step taken, in order to render the Work complete. I have not had Time to digeſt my Thoughts into a regular Scheme, and ſhall therefore content myſelf to ſuggeſt a few Hints, which may be improved at Maturity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> As it is apparent from what has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved already, that the Chriſtian Religion has no longer a Footing in this Country, it may not be improper to repeal the ſacramental Teſt, and to ſubſtitute in its Room the Act of Circumciſion; for which Purpoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Circumciſers may be found in <hi>Duke's-Place,</hi> who ſhall perform the Operation upon all our Placemen; and a proper Number may be choſen out of a certain venerable Body, in the Nature of a Jury of Matrons, to examine whether the Perſon be qualified according to Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the <hi>Jews</hi> are known to be poſſeſſed of over-grown Riches, and as no Lottery can be vigorouſly carried on without their Concurrence, whenever Sir
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0311400901:236"/>
                     <hi>John Barnard,</hi> or any Patriot inclinable to Chriſtianity, ſhall deviſe a Scheme to prevent Impoſitions from Stock-Jobbers, it will be adviſeable to let nobody into the Subſcription but the above-mentioned <hi>Jews,</hi> who certainly cannot grow too rich, as our Regard for them will increaſe in Proportion to their Pelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I am of Opinion, that it is prejudicial to this Kingdom to exclude the ſaid <hi>Jews</hi> from Employments Civil and Military, becauſe, as they have no other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of their own, it is highly probable, that they will love <hi>England,</hi> (or <hi>Judaea Nova</hi>) with an Exceſs of Zeal; and if they were appointed to ſupply our Army and Navy with Proviſions upon all Emergencies, it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be perfectly agreeable to the Taſte of our Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery and our Mariners to be fed with Beef cured by a <hi>Jew</hi> Butcher. Aboard the Fleet particularly, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly be pleaſing to have a Meſs of Beef with a Label of ſtamped Lead upon it, to convince the Men that it has been duly cured. And further, inſtead of making Men of Merit Knights of the <hi>Bath,</hi> or promoting them to ſuch like Honours, ſuppoſe they were to be diſtinguiſhed (<hi>Secundum ordinem Melchizedec,</hi>) by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> it would not be an improper Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this I ſubmit to better Judgments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi>— I humbly propoſe, that an Army may be ſpeedily raiſed for the Retaking <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which happy Event would enable our good Friends and now Countrymen the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to rebuild their Temple; by which Means they would entirely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the only Obſtacle which now remains, towards diſſipating thoſe Errors, which have miſguided People theſe ſeventeen Hundred fifty three Years paſt. And I hope, the bad Succeſs of that great Man <hi>Julian the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> who was defeated, by the Interpoſition of Heaven, in an Attempt of this Kind, will be no Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>This Extract, I apprehend, may ſerve to convince the Reader, that Fortune is but an erroneous Rule, by which to judge of a Character. As I conceive it, the Term <hi>Senſe</hi> is derived from the Organs of bodily Senſation, which, when in due Order, give to the Mind an immediate Information of the Qualities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in natural Bodies; from thence the Phraſe is transſferred to the human Mind, and denotes a quick Power of Perception in the Underſtanding upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences in Life. Were I to define a Man of Senſe, I ſhould call him a Perſon of clear Apprehenſion and ſound Judgment; Talents, which a ſmall Degree of Obſervation will convince us, many are poſſeſſed of, though they do not upon all Occaſions avail themſelves of them; but, on the contrary, let them lie dormant in their Minds, without calling them forth into Action. The late Sir <hi>Richard Steel,</hi> I believe, may be allowed to have enjoyed as ſtrong Intellectuals as any Cit what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and yet in pecuniary Matters his Conduct was highly negligent. It is ſaid of this Gentleman, that going one Day into his Chariot, with an intimate
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0311400901:241"/>Friend, whom he had invited to his Country-Houſe, as he paſſed through a Lane of his Servants, who had drawn themſelves up in the Hall, the humorous Knight, looking over his Shoulder at his Acquaintance, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly repeated from <hi>Horace,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Mancipiis locuples eget aeris Cappadocum Rex.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <q>The King of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> is well provided with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but wants Money.</q> From this it will appear, what Degree of Regard that Genius had for yellow Dirt, which, though a Neceſſary of Life, is certainly incapable of conferring one ſingle Accompliſhment either to the Head or Heart, and is generally the Acquiſition of the Dulleſt of human Race.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that to create a Fortune in the ordinary Paths of Buſineſs, is ſo far from requiring Wit, Genius, Learning, Imagination, Invention, or any liberal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that every one of thoſe Attributes have rather a Tendency to keep the Poſſeſſor of them ſtill the poorer, "as Heaven's bleſt Beams turns Vinegar more ſour." An eager Love of Pelf, a narrow Attention to what is called the main Chance, a Spice of that Clergyman's Way of thinking who delivered in his Sermon that "a Shilling is a ſerious Thing," and a cold, languid, unimpaſſioned Temper, are the principal Ingredients in the Compoſition of the Man of Buſineſs; while Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quick Underſtanding will always have lively Senſations, which muſt, at Times, hurry them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scenes of Action aſtoniſhing to the ſober Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, or the ſedate Book-keeper; but it ſhould be remembered, that Paſſions are the Gales of Life, and that to be diveſted of them, is ſo far from denoting a ſenſible Mind, that it is a Proof of lamentable Dullneſs
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0311400901:242"/>and Stupidity. I ſhall conclude this Paper with two ſhort Characters drawn from real Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Avarus</hi> was bound to a Trade at fourteen. Years of Age; he cleaned his Maſter's Shoes, laid under the Counter, ſwept the Shop, ſcraped the Threſhold, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Leads to clean the Gutter, went regularly to the Poſt-Office with Letters, was perfectly well verſed in the Rule of Three, and had the Merchant's Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory by Heart. On <hi>Sundays</hi> he would take a ſober Walk to <hi>Iſlington, Newington, Paddington,</hi> &amp;c. and, when a Frolic ſeized him, he would, in the Fulneſs of his Soul, ſpend his Threepence at <hi>Jenny</hi>'s <hi>Whim.</hi> As he grew up, he became a downright <hi>Stoic</hi> in the Government of his Paſſions, to ſuch a Degree, that he was thought at length totally to have extinguiſhed them all, except his darling Love of Money, which has never ceaſed to influence his Thoughts. In ſhort, <hi>Avarus</hi> has been ſo attentive to the main Chance, that he is now flouriſhing and ſtarving with a large Fortune; is determined to ſell his Vote at the next Election, and is likely in Time to be made Sheriff of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Liberalis</hi> was bred at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> School, where he was always famous for a keen Turn at an Epigram, and, when removed to the Univerſity, he was thought to have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him a great Knowledge of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> While at <hi>Oxford</hi> he enlarged his Mind with uſeful Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and cultivated a juſt and elegant Taſte for all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Literature. Being turned of One and twenty, he entered himſelf in the <hi>Temple,</hi> where he read the Law with ſufficient Application; but, in order to unbend his Mind, he was frequently found dipping into <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear;</hi> and it has been ſaid by his Enemies, that he never would entirely diveſt himſelf of an Attachment to the <hi>Belles Lettres.</hi> I have ſomewhere ſeen it remarked, that a Taſte in Reading is apt to infuſe the ſame in Morals; which Obſervation proved fatally true to <hi>Liberalis,</hi> and in Conſequence of this Turn of Mind, he could never
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0311400901:243"/>prevail on himſelf to fall into any mean Practices, by which Conduct he ſoon found himſelf deſerted by his Clients, and neglected by the Attorneys; and he now remains unſought in his Chambers, in the high Road to Poverty; in which, agreeably to the Way of the World, we will leave him to himſelf, and lay down the Pen.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>PON going into the <hi>Bedford</hi> Coffee-houſe a few Days ſince, I found my Friend <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>air</hi> in a Circle of his Acquaintance; he was talking over the ſeveral Occurrences he had met with in his Rambles after Intelligence that Day; and, as he has a peculiar Dexterity in dreſſing up a Story in all its moſt ſtriking Colours, without falling into a tedious minute Detail of trivial Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, he touched upon many Incidents in a Manner ſo diverting, that he excited a general Mirth in the little Audience that was gathered round him. <hi>Wildair,</hi> to ſpeak the Truth, has ſomething extremely captivating in his Converſation, and is, of all the Men I know, the beſt turned for Society. Though a Fellow of Parts, he has never ſuffered his Spirits to ſubſide into a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Habit of thinking, but, in a ſuperficial Way, glides over every Thing that offers in Company; no Subject comes amiſs to him, and be it what it will, he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſomething to ſay for himſelf; which Circumſtance, joined to a ſprightly Delivery, contributes greatly to enliven his Company. He frequently rallies a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of our intimate Acquaintance on this Head, and will tell him frankly, <q>I know, <hi>Jack,</hi> you are a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Fellow in the main, but as you manage Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, your Friends muſt ſtudy hard to find it out;—
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0311400901:245"/>take my Word for it, the World is very ſuperficial, and a Facility of diſmiſſing every Subject in a briſk Manner, will make a Perſon paſs for a Knowing one, at the ſame Time that it renders him ſociable, and of courſe agreeable.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is my worthy Friend <hi>Wildair</hi>'s Way of thinking, and upon this Plan he acquits himſelf ſo well, that he is extremely ſought by his Acquaintance, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they lay hold of him, it is difficult for him to elude their Solicitations for a Party of Pleaſure. This was the Caſe with him the other Night, and as I was pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Debt at the Bar, he made up to me, and with a Whiſper told me, That if I would make one of the Company, it would furniſh me with Hints for ſome future Eſſay. In vain I reminded him that it was Club Night, and his Turn to poſſeſs the Chair; this Party, he aſſured me, would afford higher Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I yielded to his Sollicitations, and I muſt ſay, that my Manner of ſpending the Evening has ſupplied me with Materials, the like of which never came in my Way before.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed farther into the Buſineſs, it may not be improper, in Imitation of the Writers for the Stage, to give a Degree of Inſight into the Characters of the <hi>Dramatis Perſonae.</hi> The Reader is already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my Diſpoſition and Way of thinking, and he alſo knows Mr. <hi>Wildair.</hi> The reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany conſiſted of a MAN OF WIT, a MAN OF HUMOUR, a DAMN'D HONEST FELLOW, and a Perſon of a very elegant Appearance, a cool ſedate Temper, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely decent and polite in his Deportment. With this Set, I ſhifted the Scene from the <hi>Bedford</hi> to the <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s-<hi>Head,</hi> and upon entering the Tavern, the HONEST FELLOW alarmed the Houſe, by calling for a Room with great Vociferation; which being ſhewed to us with the utmoſt Attention, he ordered a Brace of Bottles of the right Sort, immediately filled a Round
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0311400901:246"/>of Bumpers, and roared out, "Come let's be jolly, <hi>Ranger,</hi>"—"d—mn your muſty Books"—<q>let's ſit down.</q>—This I had no Objection to; but as I was attempting to do it, the MAN OF HUMOUR, with infinite Pleaſantry, removed the Chair that was placed for me; the Conſequence of which was, that, to the great Surprize of the whole Company, I was brought to the Ground. As I received a Contuſion in the Fall, I could not entirely reliſh the Joke, but it gave infinite Satisfaction to almoſt all the reſt, and they agreed, that it really was a very good Thing, as good a Thing as ever they had known: "Immenſe, by G—d," ſays the HONEST FELLOW, "a glorious Hum," ſays the WIT; while my humorous Friend, with a dry Compoſure of Countenance, denoting ſomething between Jeſt and Earneſt, begged my Pardon, and then officiouſly offered to ſettle my Wig; and this he did in ſuch a facetious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and ſuch a whimſical Stare of the Curls, that thence was deducible a new Flow of Mirth, which, amidſt the Burſts of Joy that ſtunned my Ears, he enjoyed in a ſober Manner, Humour being ever grave and ſedate. <hi>Wildair</hi> perceiving by this Time, that I did not approve my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, came over to me, and begged I would ſee it out, and ſqueezing my Hand, he added from <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                     <q>Forſan &amp; haec olim meminiſſe juvabit.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This had ſo much Prevalence with me, that I agreed, and the HONEST FELLOW ſhewed away egregiouſly. The Bottle went round at ſo briſk a Rate, that my Eyes began to dance in my Head like Wild-fire. By all that's Burgundy, ſays he, <q>
                        <hi>Harris</hi> is the beſt Pimp in <hi>England,</hi>—Here Waiter, call <hi>Harris (Enter Harris) —Harris,</hi> d—mn your old Soul, get us a fine Girl"—"There's a fine Girl pleaſe your Honour at a Place I know,—no body has ſeen her but <hi>Lord Shallow,</hi> and myſelf—and there's <hi>Betty Connor,</hi>
                        <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0311400901:247"/>juſt arrived from <hi>Dublin</hi>—'Squire <hi>M'Hazard</hi> brought her with him; ſhe has fine Fleſh and Blood, pleaſe your Honour,—moſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wenches have, pleaſe your Honour,—and if your Honour chuſes it, I fancy I have a Bait will bring her out.</q>— This Propoſal was univerſally received, and in a ſhort Time the Lady was uſhered into the Room, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Glances mutually interchanged between her and <hi>Harris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The MAN OF HUMOUR and the WIT immediately began to play her off, as they called it—But, as it is a Rule among good Writers, never to enlarge too much upon any Subject, and to leave ſomething for the Imagination of the Reader to ſupply, I ſhall upon this Occaſion conform to the Precept; and will only add, that the Lady, in the Space of about half an Hour, drank and ſung, and laughed and cried, and danced and ſat, and talked and ſaid nothing, with the moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Quickneſs in the Viciſſitude, till at length, the HONEST FELLOW ſwore that ſhe ſpoiled good Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and-abruptly deſired her to take half a Guinea at the Bar and withdraw, which Madam performed after ſeveral Te hes and Titters.</p>
                  <p>This Matter being ſettled, we were ſuddenly ſurprized with the moſt enlivening Melody, accompanied by a ſprightly Voice, that plainly and muſically articulated, <hi>Non, toujours dire non, &amp;c.</hi> It ſeems, one of thoſe fair Natives of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who are good-natured enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the Fatigue of a long Journey, in order to make our Public Streets harmonious, was placed in the Yard, with private Inſtructions to entertain us with the vocal and inſtrumental Strain. By this our Spirits received a freſh Reinforcement, and the MAN OF WIT immediately threw his Wig out of the Window, bounced over the Table, broke ſeveral Bottles and Glaſſes, and alarmed me with a moſt intolerable Rap on the Shoulders. The
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0311400901:248"/>MAN OF HUMOUR expreſſed his Approbation with a dry Joke; the HONEST FELLOW puſhed the <hi>Burgundy</hi> about, and the decent Gentleman, whom the Reader will recollect I mentioned in the Beginning of this Paper, ſmiled with the moſt winning Complacence. This Perſonage has hitherto made no Figure in this <hi>Sympoſium;</hi> the Fact is, he did not drink above ſix Glaſſes of Wine during the whole Night; but now his Heart ſeemed to dilate, his Eyes ſparkled with the moſt vivid Luſtre, and in the Chearfulneſs of his Soul, he held out his Fiſt to the Company, and, <q>Come, ſays he, Odd or Even for this little Silver.</q> The Spirits of almoſt every one preſent were ready to flow into any Channel, and Gaming became the general Amuſement. Cards were immediately rung for to play at Brag, and after a few Rounds, the ELEGANT POLITE MAN pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a Box and Dice out of his Pocket, and I believe he will hardly forgive me for deſiring a Bill at Five in the Morning, as he was in a tolerable Run, and had picked up about ſeventy Pounds. However, with ſome Reluctance, he condeſcended to collect the Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which, as ſoon as every Body paid his Proportion, he carefully put into his Pocket, and deſired his Friend <hi>Tomkyns</hi> to place the whole to his Account.</p>
                  <p>This being adjuſted, in order to compleat this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the MAN OF HUMOUR propoſed a Scheme, which, he ſaid, would afford more Pleaſantry than he had ever known. <q>It-is, ſays he, the luckieſt Thought in the World—a better—ne—never—enter —ed—into a—Man's—He—ad—let us tofs up, who ſhall—be—th—thrown—out of—the Window, for the frol—frolick ſake.</q>—I was very much averſe from this Piece of Merriment, but being over-ruled by the Company, it was immediately done, and the Lot fell to my Friend <hi>Wildair,</hi> who was inſtantly ſurrounded, and the HONEST FELLOW opened the Window, not without violent Roaring, while the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0311400901:249"/>DECENT MAN ſtill continued at the Table, throwing the Dice, and ſaying to himſelf, "Seven's the Main." I really believe, the Coroner's Inqueſt would have ſat on <hi>Wildair</hi>'s Body at Ten o'Clock in the Morning, had not the timely Interpoſition of ſober Entreaty begged him off.</p>
                  <p>Upon this I made my Eſcape, and I do not know when I ſpent an Evening in a Manner that has given me ſuch Reflections. The MAN OF WIT, I ſuppoſe, has acquired his Notions of Things from Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore,</hi> who tells us, that Wit conſiſts in regular and exalted Ferments; or from Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> who defines it, a Motion of furious Joy and Pride of Soul upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of an Hint; for indeed, this Gentleman has certainly very exalted Ferments, and moſt ſurprizing Motions upon the Conception of his Hints. I ſhall take Occaſion in ſome enſuing Eſſay, to undeceive him, by giving the Ideas I have formed to myſelf of the Talent he profeſſes; and in my next Lucubration I ſhall endeavour to convince the MAN OF HUMOUR, that he is wide of the Character he would be thought to poſſeſs. As HUMOUR is a Subject of ſome Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, I ſhall endeavour to treat it with Perſpicuity, and I beforehand beg ſome Mercy of the Critics.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has been long ſince recommended to the Tribe of Criticks, to adjuſt and ſettle their Ideas, in a clear and regular Order, by fixing the diſtinct Meaning annexed to each Term they make uſe of in conveying their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks. If this Advice was properly adhered to, it would cut Matters very ſhort in all Debates, which ariſe upon Points of Literature; and would enable thoſe, who aſpire to the Province of Criticiſm, to paſs their Judgment with Preciſion. But the Reverſe of this is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Caſe, and I ſhall at preſent ſingle out two Expreſſions, from a Multitude of others, which appear to me to be uſed in a vague, random Manner, the determinate Meaning of either not being ſufficiently aſcertained.</p>
                  <p>The Terms, I mean, are an HUMOURIST and a MAN OF HUMOUR. They are thought, by what I find, ſynonymous by many People, which muſt be the Source of numberleſs Miſtakes. To define each, may be, perhaps, Matter of ſome Difficulty; but if I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them right, the Reader is welcome to what Light I can give him into the Matter.</p>
                  <p>An HUMOURIST, I take to be, one under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſome remarkable Oddity, or unaccountable Whim, which has taken ſuch ſtrong Poſſeſſion of the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0311400901:252"/>Mind, and has ſo inſinuated itſelf into all its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that it mixes with the common Train of his Ideas, and thereby gives ſuch a Caſt to his Way of thinking, that every Thing ſtrikes him in a different Light from the reſt of his Fellow-Creatures, and of Conſequence, every Thing he does, is alſo in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Manner.</p>
                  <p>I have not been able to inveſtigate, in any Hiſtorian, the firſt Appearance of this Species of Men in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Whether it was in the Nature of the <hi>Aborigines,</hi> or firſt Inhabitants of this Iſland; or whether it made its Inroad among us, with that general Conflux of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nations, which landed here, is a Point not very eaſy to determine. One Thing is clear, that they are of a long Standing among us, and indeed they thrive with ſuch large Increaſe in this our Soil, that there is room to apprehend, the whole Nation will ſhortly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Nation of odd Fellows.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the many Extravagancies, which this Set of Men are addicted to, they have all a ſtrange Notion, that they muſt have their own Way. Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> has obſerved, that there is a Proverb by which they are, in a great Meaſure, governed. <hi>He that will have a May-pole, ſhall have a May-pole.</hi> They are entirely attached to the Gratification of their own particular Bent; their Imaginations have contracted ſuch whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Habits, that they ſee Things through a Medium, to which Men of a more reaſonable Turn, are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and thence it reſults, that wild and fantaſtick Opinions are delivered upon all Topics, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is nothing but a Series of Inconſiſtencies.</p>
                  <p>The Perſon, who falls into this Way of thinking, is properly ſpeaking an HUMOURIST, and <hi>Quidquid vult, valde vult,</hi> ſhould be the Motto of every one of them; they being all inflexible in Purſuit of their Inclinations. It is a trite Remark, that the Spirit of Liberty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, which is diffuſed throughout this Kingdom,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0311400901:253"/>contrioutes very much to feed this odd Turn, and to promote its Growth. I have mixed frequently in the Meetings of <hi>Humouriſts,</hi> in order to animadvert upon their Ways; and have always obſerved, that none of them will ſuffer themſelves to be controuled, for this exceilent Reaſon; becauſe, <q>D—mn my Blood, I can club my Reckoning as well as any Man, and I have been an Houſe-keeper, Man and Boy theſe thirty or forty Years; and I pay my Rent, and ſo a Fig for King <hi>G</hi>—.</q>—Thus, while the HUMOURIST has his Property ſecured to him, by the ſalutary Laws of our noble Conſtitution, he will enjoy his Independency; to give a Proof of which, he thinks it eſſential to have a Value for no Man; and to pleaſe himſelf, though at the Expence of his Company, is his darling Delight.</p>
                  <p>It is to the Obſervation of theſe Oddities, that we owe the MAN OF HUMOUR; and hence is deducible a Definition, or rather Deſcription of his Character. He is one who <hi>Eyes Natures Walks,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſinely phraſes it, and <hi>catches the Manners living, as they riſe.</hi> He ſees the Pololes, which have taken Root in the Man, and the many motly Circumſtances, which adhere to him. He looks, as it were, into his very mind, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives there the Jaundice, through which every Thing pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>es; and from whence all Objects derive their Hue; he ſees the Imagination tinged with this ſtrange Dye, and all the Affections of the Soul diſcoloured by it. He views ſuch Traces formed in his Brain, that it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered quite different, from that of any other human Creature; and thus the MAN OF HUMOUR perceives the ſecret and internal Springs of Action, which lead on the HUMOURIST; he cannot help ſmiling to ſee the Operations of his Soul ſo extravagant, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with the latent Cauſe of thoſe odd Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances which diſcloſe themſelves upon all Occaſions, he afterwards repreſents them to the World in true and lively Colours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0311400901:254"/>Thus may the two Characters in Queſtion, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, though they have been ſo much miſtaken by many People. The Confuſion, I apprehend, is owing to the vague Uſe of the Word HUMOUR, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly applied to both. It is common to ſay of the HUMOURIST, he has his Humour, or it is his Humour, and of the humourous Man, we aſſert, that he has a great Fund of Humour. In both Caſes, the Phraſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with ta different Senſe, denoting in the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Foible or Whim, which operates upon the Man's Conduct, and in the latter ſignifying that Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry, which repreſents the odd Fellow in a diverting Light. The Poverty of our Language has introduced this ambiguous Uſe of the Word, but if People would be carefur to acquire Perſpicuity in their Ideas, and the Terms they expreſs them by, it would prevent much Perplexity and Confuſion.</p>
                  <p>For Inſtance, it would be abſurd in any Critic, to call the inimitable Mr. <hi>Fielding</hi> an HUMOURIST, but he who would pronounce him to be a Man of exquiſite Humour, would, I believe, expreſs ſomething more pertinent to the Point. In like Manner, Mr <hi>Hogarth</hi> has exhibited in his Pieces, with the moſt maſterly Strokes of his Pencil, an whole Set of <hi>Humouriſts,</hi> and the ingenious Artiſt, who thus enchant our Eye, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a MAN OF HUMOUR.</p>
                  <p>There is another Cauſe, to which, in my Opinion, this Miſtake has been greatly owing; it frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that a MAN OF HUMOUR, is at the ſame Time in ſome Meaſure, an HUMOURIST himſelf. Theſe two Characters, thus blended together, have often a very happy Effect, and ſerve to heighten each other. This we Experience in <hi>Shaieſpear</hi>'s <hi>Falſtaff,</hi> in whom we find united in a pleaſing Aſſemblage, the mixed Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of theſe two different Characters. Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Love of Plunder, his Pretenſions to Deeds of Hardineſs; his Averſion to Cowards, and his moralizing on the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0311400901:255"/>of the Age, cannot but appear whimſical, when we conſider, that he is ſitter to drink Sack and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>button him after Dinner, than to attempt Feats of Proweſs, that he is an accompliſhed Coward in his Heart, and that his Way of Life is quite abandoned and diſſolute. Theſe are the Circumſtances, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note him an odd Fellow, but his quick Perception of the Foibles of his Neighbours, and his Vivacity in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting them in a ridiculous Point of View, are the Qualities which conſtitute him a MAN OF HUMOUR. This laſt Circumſtance, I apprehend, makes Sir <hi>John,</hi> a Favourite with every Body, and endears him to all the Sons of Merriment; and in this, if I miſtake not, lies the chief Difference between <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> and <hi>Ben Johaſon.</hi> The Characters produced by the latter, are always diſagreeably odd; their Whims are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, that they ſometimes deſerve rather the Name of Madmen, and there is hardly any Thing in any of them, that would induce a Gentleman to ſpend an Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them.</p>
                  <p>It requires a cloſe Knowledge of the World, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit Perſonages of this Caſt on the Stage. Every Idea that riſes in the Mind of an odd Fellow, his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Ways of Thinking and Inconſiſtencies, muſt be the conſtant Object of the Poets Attention, and he muſt be careful to give to each his ſpecific Language. The Player muſt not only be acquainted with the human Heart, and human Underſtanding; but he has alſo a farther Step to take. He muſt Watch the HUMOURIST in every Circumſtance; his Manner of Delivery, his Tone of Voice, the Caſt of his Eye, his every Geſture and Attitude muſt fall immediately under his Inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to all this, he muſt add, the rare Talent of concealing his Art.</p>
                  <p>In this Point, I am apt to think, Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent as he is, from an Over-warmth of Spirit, ſometimes deficient. I would ſubmit it to himſelf, whether his Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0311400901:256"/>of the Whimſies of ſome Characters is not now and then too lively, and whether his Senſations do not carry him ſo far in ſome Paſſages, as to make it viſible, that he is conſcious of the Oddity of the Appearance, even while he is perſonating the Man?—His <hi>Bobadil</hi> is one of the Exceptions to this Remark, and his not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Fancy to run into Riots in that Part, has ſo ſine an Effect, that I am perſuaded, were healways equally upon his Guard, his greateſt Enemy would have nothing to do but to admire him.</p>
                  <p>Whoever has ſeen Mrs. <hi>Pritchard</hi> in <hi>Beatrice,</hi> in <hi>Maria,</hi> in <hi>Clarinda,</hi> &amp;c. will recollect ſuch lively and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Touches of Nature as can hardly be equalled, unleſs the Pleaſantry of Mrs. <hi>Clive</hi> in her very humourous Walk of Comedy, may be deemed to rival them.</p>
                  <p>I cannot conclude without Mention of Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> who is certainly admirable in every Species of acting. In Tragedy, his Power over the Paſſions is too well known, to be here inſiſted on, and in Comedy, every Thing is impreſſed by him on his Audience with the niceſt Skill, and in ſuch Parts as <hi>Benedict</hi> and Sir <hi>John Brute,</hi> he is at once an <hi>Humouriſt</hi> and a <hi>Man of Humour</hi> with the moſt diverting Pleaſantry. I ſhall diſmiſs this Paper, after applying the Words of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> on this Occaſion. "He is not more a Maſter of <q>the <hi>great,</hi> than of the <hi>ridiculous</hi> in human Nature; of our nobleſt Tenderneſſes, than of our vaineſt Foibles; of our ſtrongeſt Emotions, than of our idleſt Senſations.</q>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I remember right, you ſome Time ſince recommended the Maxim of an old <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſopher, who lays it down as a Rule, that we ſhould not ſuffer any Thing in Life to take too ſtrong an Hold of our Imagination, becauſe that Power of the Mind is found to have a very conſiderable Influence upon all our Sentiments and all our Actions. Certainly
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0311400901:264"/>when the Reins are thrown looſe upon the Neck of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed Fancy, we become inſtantly addicted to what is called in the common Phraſe <hi>Caſtle-Building,</hi> than which there is not a more dangerous Exerciſe of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Faculties. It is a continual roving of our Thoughts to ideal Scenes of Joy; Pleaſure is our Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, and when it does not appear within our Reach, we catch at the Shadow, inſtead of the Subſtance; we ramble into a kind of Fools Paradiſe, and lounge away our Hours in the imaginary Gardens of a dreaming <hi>Eficurus,</hi> from whence it reſults that the Sinews of the Underſtanding become relaxed; an enervating Stillneſs ſpreads over all the Powers of the Soul, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſſolved in Luxury of its own Creation; fond Self-love holds up to us a pleaſing Picture, throws ſome Joys into Perſpective, flings what is diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able into Shades, and totally hides from us the thorny Parts of the Landſkip. Theſe perhaps may be accounted Pleaſures, but they are in the main like the viſionary Ideas excited by taking <hi>Laudanum;</hi> at the ſame Time that they adminiſter a Flow of Spirits, they invade our Nerves and render us entirely unfit for any Sphere of Action.</p>
                        <p>An Inſtance of this intoxicating Power of <hi>Caſtle-Building</hi> I have obſerved for ſome Time paſt in Mrs. <hi>Vainlove,</hi> who has ſpent the greateſt Part of her Life in a waking Dream, and can hardly be accounted one of this World, as ſhe has been, in the general, quite abſtracted from Society, and has dwelt moſtly in the airy Regions of Fancy. Mrs. <hi>Vainlove,</hi> in the greener Part of her Life, was flattered into a Notion of her own Beauty, by which Means ſhe became fond of Power. Her Eyes, ſhe thought gave her a <hi>Right divine</hi> to be a pretty Tyrant over the oppoſite Sex, and as the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination never deals out Bleſſings with a ſcanty Hand, her Sway ſoon became in Appearance as extenſive as her moſt deluſive Hopes could deſire. But though ſhe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0311400901:265"/>led the whole Race of Man in Captivity, ſhe at length condeſcended to let an ambitious Lover aſpire to her Bed. The Conſequence of this Condeſcenſion was, that in due Courſe of Time ſhe was the happy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a fair Daughter, in whom ſhe ſaw her own Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but moulded with greater Delicacy. Self-love inclined her to admire this flattering Likeneſs of herſelf, and the Emanations of Fancy beſtowed upon her every Grace. Before Miſs could walk, in the Mother's Eye ſhe danced with all the Elegance of <hi>Auretti,</hi> and as ſoon as her Tongue began to utter imperfect Words; <q>Lord what a deal of Wit the Child has? Dear Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin a'nt you aſtoniſhed at her? 'pon Honour I never taught her that.</q> In Proceſs of Time Miſs <hi>Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi> devoured up theſe Expreſſions of Admiration with a greedy Ear, and ſhe began inſenſibly to believe every Word perfectly true, till at length her Imagination took the very ſame Turn which had diſtorted the Thoughts of her Mother before, and a Series of Years, inſtead of baniſhing the Deceit, but ſerved to give a ſtronger Tincture to her Fancy.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Dido</hi> is croſſed in Love, and ſhe finds herſelf upon the Point of being deſerted by the <hi>Trojan</hi> Prince, her ready Fancy ſeizes the Occaſion to diſturb her with viſionary Scenes of Solitude, in which ſhe thinks herſelf abandoned and forlorn.</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>—Semperque relinqui</l>
                           <l>Sola ſibi, ſemper longam incomitata videtur</l>
                           <l>Ire Viam. —</l>
                        </q>
                        <p>But with Miſs <hi>Vainlove</hi> the Cafe is quite reverſed; though it ſhould happen that her Fate removes her from the dear Society of Man; though the ſudden Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence of a Pimple on her Face or Neck ſhould doom her a Recluſe, until her Skin regains its native Alabaſter Smoothneſs; though an untractable Lock ſhould refuſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0311400901:266"/>to join in amicable Confederacy with the Reſt of her Head-dreſs, and determine her in a Fit of Peeviſhneſs to ſequeſter herſelf from the World, yet ſtill ſhe reigns Queen of the Aſſembly, and has a Circle of Beaux about her; the ideal Footman's Rap ſounds Tranſport to her Ear, and ſhe is every Inſtant receiving the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of contending Lovers, who have no Exiſtence but in her own Brain. Her Mother confirms her in the Deception, and through the Force of Habit, they are conſtantly amuſed with Pictures of their own Creation; like thoſe, who, Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> tells us in his Treatiſe on the <hi>Conduct of the Underſtanding,</hi> through ſome Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature in their Blood, or any other internal Cauſe, ſee a Variety of Colours paſſing continually before them, and frequently perceive a Groupe of human Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, Soldiers and Combatants marching in Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before the deluded Eye of diſtempered Fancy.</p>
                        <p>Miſs <hi>Vainlove</hi> has carried Matters to ſuch an Extreme, that ſhe really thinks herſelf the moſt celebrated Toaſt about Town at preſent; <hi>Ryan</hi> at the <hi>King's Arms</hi> is under infinite Obligations to her for the plentiful Libations of Burgundy, which have been poured out to her Beauty at his Houſe; and almoſt all the Taverns in the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> have felt in this Way, the happy Influence of her Beauty.</p>
                        <p>Her Footman has the beſt Place in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe as ſhe has taken it into her Head, he is in the conſtant Receipt of Bribes at all public Places, to induce him to tell the Name of his young Miſtreſs, and the Place of her Abode. Madam <hi>La Place</hi> owes a great deal of her Succeſs in Buſineſs to Miſs <hi>Vainlove</hi>'s having the Lead of all the Faſhions, and directing the Ladies of her Acquaintance to her Milliner, that they may ſet themſelves off with the ſame Advantages of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>Miſs <hi>Vainlove,</hi> without having one real Lover, has conſtantly a large Number of fancied Slaves to her
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0311400901:267"/>Frowns and Smiles, and from thence it happens, that ſhe looks upon all the Women as a Set of Creatures that envy her, and the Men ſhe conſiders as her Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, fit for nothing but to grace her Triumph. There is nothing more common with her than to be within a few Days of being married to a Man of large Fortune, even when ſhe never exchanged a Word with him. <q>Well, to be ſure, ſays ſhe, it's ſurprizing how Things are whiſpered about; the common Report is, that I am to be married to Mr. <hi>What-do ye-call-him,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doubt it is in my Power.—but—Lord the whole Town has it.</q> It is in vain to aſſure her that the Town does not trouble its Head about her; her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has told her ſhe does not meet ſo fine a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man any where, and ſo the Opiate works. I met both theſe egregious Characters at <hi>Vauxhall</hi> a few Nights ſince, when they informed me, that the whole Set of foreign Ambaſſadors were now in the young Ladies Train, and that **** who is a Man of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and Forture in the Country, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents, is abſolutely expiring for Miſs <hi>Vainlove.</hi> It happened, that after this I paid her ſeveral Viſits, and never meeting any of her florid Retinue, I took the Liberty to mention that I never had the Pleaſure of ſeeing her gay Set of Enamoratos; to this Mrs. <hi>Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi> replied, that ſhe had given them their Anſwer, <q>Whenever we give them their Anſwer, they never come again.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus theſe two Ladies never ſee any Thing in its proper Colour; they think their Dreams Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and, like mad People, are conſtantly reaſoning right from wrong Principles. Pray, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to a Mind diſeaſed, as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> phraſes it; let them know that they cannot ſubſiſt very long upon ſuch airy Pleaſures, as they imagine to themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, that there is great Truth in what is ſaid, perhaps too looſely by the comic Poet.</p>

                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>THE Republic of Letters has happily removed that aukward Diſtance, and that extreme Difficulty of Acceſs, which Policy, miniſterial Artifice, and inſolent Pride have eſtabliſhed in the ordinary Intercourſe of Life; by which Means it has obtained, that the eaſy Seaſons of Application, the <hi>mollia tempora fandi,</hi> are at all times allowed to every Member of the ſerene Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public already mentioned; and, while Decency and good Manners are preſerved, an eaſy Habitude ſubſiſts between the higheſt and the loweſt of that auguſt Body. Freedom of Converſe is the happy Colliſion, which has ſtruck out ſo many new Lights in every Thing relating to the Sciences and the liberal Arts; and it has been obſerved that there is no Book ſo mean but ſome uſeful Hint may poſſibly be derived from it. On this Account it may be proper to wave all Offers at an Apology, for the Liberty an unknown Writer allows himſelf, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing a Letter to ſo enlightened a Genius; I ſhall only premiſe, on this Occaſion, that I take the Pen in Hand with that Reſpect to which you are certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled by the Superiority of your Parts; but as I have taken Exceptions to ſome Criticiſms, ſcattered up and down in your Writings, I cannot ſuppreſs a very ſtrong Inclination of making ſome Remarks upon them.</p>
                        <p>I have obſerved, Sir, that you are apt to reprobate the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage, with ſome Degree of Acrimony, whenever it comes in your Way, and that you have not heſitated to make free with our immortal <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> after a Manner, which, in my Opinion, is inconſiſtent
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0311400901:271"/>with that Relish for manly Sense, which seems to be your Characteristic, and in a Stile, which to me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears destitute of your usual Delicacy. If I should say, that the boasted <hi>Bienséance</hi> of your Country has relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished you in some of these Paſsages, I flatter myself that upon a Review of them, you will not totally disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow it. The most striking of the various Judgments, which you have vented against the greatest Dramatic Genius in the World, is found in your Discourse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, to your Tragedy of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and is literally translated into <hi>English</hi> as follows.</p>
                        <q>I do not mean to justify the Tragedy of <hi>Hamlet</hi> in every Particular; it is in Fact a barbarous Piece, abounding with such groſs Absurdities, that it would not be tolerated by the Vulgar in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> The Hero of the Play runs mad in the second Act, and his Mistreſs meets with the same Misfortune in the third. The Prince takes <hi>Ophelia</hi>'s Father for a Rat, and kills him, and, in Despair, she throws her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a River. Her Grave is dug on the Stage, and the Grave-Digger, with a Skull in his Hand, amuses himself with a String of miserable Jests, while the Prince answers them in Language equally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusting. <hi>Hamlet,</hi> his Mother, and Father-in-Law drink together on the Stage. They divert themselves with Bottle-Songs, <hi>(Chansons à boire)</hi> they quarrel, they fight and kill. One would imagine this Play the Production of a drunken Savage. And yet among these Absurdities, which render the <hi>English</hi> Drama absolutely barbarous, there are some Strokes in <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> worthy of the most exalted Genius. This has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been Matter of Astonishment to me; it looks as if Nature, in pure Sport, diverted herself with mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s Head every thing sublime and great, with all that can be conceived low, mean and detestable.</q>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0311400901:272"/>It is thus the elegant and sensible <hi>Voltaire</hi> speaks of <hi>Shakespear.</hi> I would submit it to yourself, Sir, whether this Criticism is candid, and whether it is a fair Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſsion of the Tragedy in Question. We do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ourselves in this Country with what is agreeable to the Taste of the Vulgar in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy;</hi> we know that the <hi>Clinquant</hi> of an Opera, or a <hi>Comedie Ballet</hi> is more acceptable to their Refinement, than the sterling Bullion of an <hi>English</hi> Performance; but we might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from a Writer of Eminence, a truer and more exact Opinion. <hi>Hamlet,</hi> Sir, does not run mad, though if he did, King <hi>Lear</hi> has proved what a beautiful Distreſs might arise from it; he counterfeits Madneſs, for his own private End, but no body ever imagined that he thinks he is killing a Rat, when he slays <hi>Polonius.</hi> If you will be pleased to recollect the Paſsage, you will find that he takes him for his Better, meaning the King, and that the Rat is only mentioned to save Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Ophelia</hi>'s Grave is dug on the Stage cannot be refuted; but that very Indecorum produces so many fine Reflections, and such an excellent Vein of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as perhaps, cannot be parallel'd by the <hi>Scene Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coise,</hi> and is, without doubt, warmer, and more interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than the frigid, unimpaſsioned Declamation of a more correct Writer. I cannot recollect that <hi>Hamlet</hi> ever shocked me with miserable Jests upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; not do I remember that any of them are such honest Bottle Companions as to carouse and sing merry Catches on the Stage. Pray consider, Sir, that our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, though no way inferior to the <hi>French,</hi> is not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally understood Abroad, and from your Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Matters, it may be inferred that our great Poet is really the <hi>drunken Savage,</hi> you have thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to call him. This would be derogating from the greatest Poet the World has ever seen since the Days
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0311400901:273"/>of <hi>Homer,</hi> and, I believe you will grant, is dealing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairly with a Man, whom you cannot but reverence.</p>
                        <p>When you confeſs that he has many Flights of the highest Elevation, you make an Approach towards jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; but I cannot help thinking that you are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a Painter, who lays on just and proper Colouring, and then instantly effaces it, when you and that you are astonished at his sublime Excursions of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. I should have expected from your Candour, that you would rather have said, it is a Pity that he, who soared to such glorious Heights, should ever tire his Eagle Wing, and fall beneath himself. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it is with this good Temper <hi>Longinus</hi> talks of <hi>Homer;</hi> they are Dreams, says he, but they are the Dreams of <hi>Homer.</hi> He might, perhaps, with as much Propriety as you, have given the Appellation of a <hi>drunken Savage,</hi> have called him AN OLD DOTARD, and aſserted that some of his long Stories are detestable but a candid Critic forgives the Imbecilities of human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and paſſes Sentence like a mild and good-natured Judge.</p>

                        <p>In one of your Letters concerning the <hi>English</hi> Nation, you are greatly pleased with a Saying of the late Lord <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> in Relation to the Duke of <hi>Marlborough.</hi> "He was," replied that ingenious Nobleman when his Opinion was asked, "so great a Man, that I "have forgot his Faults." Something like this might be your Judgment upon <hi>Shakespear;</hi> and it was more particularly incumbent on you, to treat his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with respect, because, I apprehend, you owe very great Obligations to him in many of your own dramatic Writings. We frequently perceive you lighting your Torch at his Fire; in your <hi>Mahomet, Macbeth marshals you the Way that you are going;</hi> in many other Scenes
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0311400901:274"/>we can catch your Eye fixed upon our immortal Bard; and in your <hi>Semiramis</hi> you have adventured to introduce a Ghost, in Imitation of the very Play, which has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned the Severity already cited. The Succeſs you met with upon that Occasion might serve to convince you of <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s inimitable Merit. The <hi>Parterre,</hi> if I mistake not, turned their Backs to the Stage, and blew their Noses; while the Ghost on our Theatre never fails to impreſs an awful Stillneſs on every Mind. This, Sir, give me leave to aſsure you, is not owing to the Barbarity of our Taste, but to the amazing Power of our Poet's Imagination, which could explore the undiscovered Regions of Eternity, and recal the slecting Spirit, with a Solemnity of Ideas responsive to the Occasion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Shakespear</hi> is a kind of established Religion in Poetry, and his Bays will always stourish with undiminished Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. When I say this, I am not for maintaining that he is not guilty of Transgreſsions, but for every Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion he recompences his Auditors with Beauties, which no Art will ever equal. That the Rules esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> are agreeable to Nature, I am ready to allow, and that inferior Geniuses may avail themselves by a skilful Conformity to them, I as freely aſsent to. But Fable is but a secondary Beauty; the Exhibition of Character, and the Excitement of the Paſsions, justly claiming the Precedence in dramatic Poetry. It is in Writing as in Gardening; where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures does not afford spontaneous Beauties, recourse must be had to the Embellishments of slow endeavouring Art, to the Regularity of uniform Vistas, the Intricacy of elaborated Mazes, and a studied Insertion of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greens; but when the Course of the Country of itself presents attractive Scenes on every Side, when the Trees branch out with a free Expansion, and the bold Prospect surprizes with the Heath, the Lawn, the Hill,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0311400901:275"/>and Valley, in wild Variety, the Littleneſs of tedious Culture is unneceſsary, and trifling Ornaments are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for.</p>
                        <p>I shall conclude, with a Paſsage from your own Works. <q>Do not blush, Sir, to repent of your little Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies. It is hard, but it is amiable to acknowledge our Errors.</q>

While it is conducted with a View to a Competency, and the Enjoyment of the Requisites for Subsistence and Comfort; while it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with a Propensity to a Man's Friends, Relations, and, as <hi>Milton</hi> has it, all the Charities of Father, Son and Brother; and while it is the Source of Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and an extensive Power of distributing Benefits to Mankind, it is, without any Manner of Doubt, a just Principle of Action; and though Self-love is the Pebble which stirs the Lake, the Circles, which it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, will always be pleasing and beautiful to the moral Sense.</p>
                  <p>But the Misfortune is, this Affection generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates into Meanneſs, and has a fatal Tendency to
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0311400901:278"/>ruin the Understanding, and to corrupt the Heart. The intellectual Soil must not lie fallow for any long Time together; and it is by Freedom of Converse, and an habitual Intercouse with the enlightened Part of the World, that a mental Vigour is to be acquired; and when the Imagination is constantly attached to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Set of Ideas, it becomes narrow by insensible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and for Want of that general Survey of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Objects, which are continually paſsing on the Scene of Life, it is confined to a small Compaſs, and never ventures to make the least Excursion further. From this close Habit of Thinking, the Heart, too frequently, contracts a lazy Apathy, and grows entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly callous to all manner of Sensation. Our Paſsions are involuntary, and are nothing else than the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which external Objects usually make upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Imagination, from the Operations of which we feel those sundry Emotions which are Incitements to spur us on from Theory to Practice, and which disclose themselves in our Actions, and are thence known to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the amiable Train of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> or to be of the hateful Family of <hi>Selfishneſs</hi> and <hi>Ill-nature.</hi> In Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion therefore as the Ideas which paſs in the Mind are scanty, the Affections, which agitate the Heart, will be fewer; and both must at last rust to a Point, and fix in a State of unfeeling Indolence.</p>
                  <p>A Love of Money is at once the Source of those Deeds which carry with them a splendid Appearance, and those also which are at first Sight mean and contemptible. This Paſsion has made many a Writer of Eminence, and many Scriblers in a Garret; it has animated the General at the Head of an Army, and the Clipper of Coin in his twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light Room; it has for many Ages thundered in the Senate, wrangled at the Bar, and lulled from the Pulpit. To this it is owing that the Merchant boldly traverses the Globe, trusting to all the Dangers of the turbulent Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0311400901:279"/>and that <hi>Buckhorse</hi> will receive as many severe Strokes of a Cane as you please, for Six-pence apiece.</p>
                  <p>The Art generally practised by People, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous either to amaſs an over-grown Fortune, or to glean up a Livelihood, without the Talents to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themselves by striking out some new Discovery, or cultivating some advantageous Branch of Trade and Commerce, is to impose upon the Credulity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and by obtruding false delusive Circumstances to excite their Curiosity, raise their Admiration, and thus guil them to comply with their Artifices of Fraud and Imposition. This Metropolis has never wanted a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Number of these Projectors, and, at present, I believe I may affirm, that it abounds with Cheats and Impostors, in every Station, in every Art and Science, and in every Circumstance of Life. The solemn Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, the specious Lawyer, the wordy Critic, and the bombast Poet, are found in all Quarters of the Town; and though they must be allowed to be very notable Masters of Deceit, I have lately made a Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a Personage, who greatly excels them all in their own Trade of Delusion and Hypocrisy. The Scheme of distributing Hand bills, importing that in <hi>Ivy-Lane, Magpye-Alley,</hi> or any other Quarter of the Town, LIVETH a regular Physician, who has spent many Years abroad, travelled all over <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> and is returned home North about to practise his Profeſsion for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Countrymen, is now entirely out of Vogue, and the Cheat is laughed at by all Degrees and Ranks of People. It is true, there are many other Plans on foot at present, which are somewhat more plausible than that which I have now touched upon; but among them all, I do not remember any Plan so well calculated to elevate and surprize, to keep up a Stare, as a new one which came into my Hands the other Day, as I was walking down <hi>Ludgate Hill.</hi> A tall meagre Man, with great Solemnity of Aspect, and strong Expreſsions of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0311400901:280"/>Amazement in his Countenance, presented to me the following Billet, which many of my Readers can bear me Witneſs is transcribed faithfully and exactly.</p>

Who resolves all Questions in Astrology, whether by Sea or Land. She likewise gives <hi>gratis</hi> to poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a Draught for the Stomach, the Powder for the Tooth-ach, and an Eye-Water.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>N. B. <hi>Cures the</hi> Ague <hi>at the Second Cup</hi> gratis.</p>
                  <p>I have heard that the present celebrated Dr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> cures the Rupture, for any Person whatever, by wearing his own Bandages, which indeed hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been Matter of Astonishment to me in my Hours of Reflection; but I must declare, in favour of Mrs. <hi>Sermon,</hi> that I think she performs greater Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders than any of them, and that her Undertaking is more likely to do Honour to our Country, than that of any other Schemist now in being. The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of her living in <hi>Naked-Boy Court</hi> is well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted to raise Curiosity, and the Convenience of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in by the <hi>Salmon with a Drop in his Mouth</hi> will prove inviting, especially as every one will be desirous of seeing that curious Animal. How she contrives to answer Questions in <hi>Astrology</hi> is beyond my Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but, if well peformed, must be highly useful to his Majesty's Subjects. She does-it also by Sea as well as Land, which is greatly advantageous to a trading Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then her Spirit of Benevolence must tend greatly to endear her to every generous and humane Mind.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Draught for the Stomach,</hi> the Powder for the <hi>Tooth-ach,</hi> and the <hi>Eye-Water,</hi> given <hi>gratis,</hi> are strong Indications of a public Spirit. Add to this that she cures the Ague at the second Cup for nothing; what
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0311400901:281"/>kind of Cup it is, I can't take upon me to ſay. But upon the whole I muſt declare that Mrs. <hi>Sermon</hi> is in my Eye a very extraordinary Perſonage; and were I to decide the Precedence between her and all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrics, Projectors, Fuſtian-Poets, Diſcoverers of the Longitude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the preſent Age, I ſhould not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate to pronounce Mrs. <hi>Sermon</hi> the moſt notable amongſt them all.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is a Court of Cenſorial Enquiry ſubſiſting at <hi>Gray's-Inn,</hi> under your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and as I ſuppoſe, from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Tendency of it, that it was deſigned in its firſt Inſtitution to be a ſecondary Aid to our Courts of Juſtice, by taking Cognizance of thoſe Offences which are not puniſhable by any of the Statute Laws of this Realm, I muſt take the Liberty to tranſmit to you an Information of ſuch a Nature, that, I am convinced, you will think it either ought to be laid before the abovementioned Court, or that it deſerves to be treated with the Touches of your Pen.</p>
                        <p>To enter at once into the Buſineſs, I muſt inform you, that I lately had Occaſion to take a Jant down to <hi>Bath,</hi> and imagining that travelling in a Stage-Coach would not be diſagreeable, I took a Place in one of thoſe Vehicles, which ſet out from the <hi>Bell Inn</hi>
                           <pb n="272" facs="tcp:0311400901:283"/>behind the New Church in the <hi>Strand.</hi> Preciſely at Two in the Morning, crack went the Coachman's Whip, and off we went with ſix Paſſengers. It being quite dark at the Hour of ſtarting, we began our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without ſo much as knowing one another's Faces, and we were protty well jolted on the Stones, before we were all properly adjuſted in our Places. For ſome Time we were entertained with a Concert of Groans, Sighs, Coughs, and other ſuch agreeable Interjections, to fill up the Pauſe of Converſation, till having paſſed the Turnpike, and being arrived to the plain Road, the Gentleneſs of the Motion, and the Stillneſs of the Night compoſed our Company to ſleep, as I inferred from the Information of their Noſes, which did not ceaſe to ply the Ear, until the Morning began to tinge the Hemiſphere towards the Eaſt with white Streaks of Light, by the Help of which I could then diſcover who and who was together. Accordingly I peruſed the Countenances of my Fellow-Travellers, and pretty plainly read in each Viſage, that very Character, which a ſhort Time convinced me was appropriated to each.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt and moſt remarkable Perſonage was the Wife of a wealthy Inhabitant of <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> going down to ſee Life, <q>for it is really, ſays ſhe, enough to fill one up with the Vapours, to be eternally moped in that odious Part of the Town, and as ſoon as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, I ſhall prevail upon Mr. <hi>Narrowmind,</hi> ſince he has now picked up his Crums, to learn a little Taſte, and remove to ſome gented Quarter.</q> This Scheme met with the inſtant Approbation of her next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, a motherly Sort of Woman, who lets Lodgings at <hi>Bath,</hi> and with whom the polite Citizen was to ſix her Reſidence. The good old Landlady declared, as how ſhe was of Opinion, Folks of Mrs. <hi>Narrowmind</hi>'s Fortune ſhould be accommodated with ſome Elegance; and then turning about, <q>Ma'em, will you chuſe to taſte the Liquor I have brought in this little Bottle?
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0311400901:284"/>I know by Experience, that it is the beſt Thing in the World to keep Wind out of the Stomach.</q> This Propoſal was agreed to, and a few Minutes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the reſt of the Company, that a Dram is not only of ſingular Uſe to keep Wind out of the Stomach, but alſo a moſt excellent Expeller of what Wind may be accidentally lodged there.</p>
                        <p>While this agreeable Couple were ſolacing themſelves, the Converſation was taken up by one, whom we ſoon diſcovered to be a <hi>Jew,</hi> bound for the Rendezvous of many of the People of Faſhion, with the double View of partaking of the Diverſions of the Place, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting rid of a little <hi>French</hi> Paſte, which lay upon his Hands. He harangued with great Volubility of Speech, and he frequently embelliſhed his Diſcourſe with many lively Flaſhes of a Diamond Ring, which played upon his Finger. Amidſt all his Vivacity, he took Care to be ſufficiently attentive to the grand Buſineſs of ſelling the abovementioned Paſte, which was with him ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial a Point, that he never once mentioned the chief Object, which at preſent engroſſes the Thoughts of his whole Nation; but, inſtead of favouring us with his political Speculations, he amuſed us with a Sight of numberleſs pretty Trinkets, the Beauties of which he explained with ſuch an artful Diſplay of his Finger, and ſo many Flouriſhes of Speech, that he ſoon cloſed a Bargain with the fine Lady, whom I have already mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The next Perſon, whom I ſhall mention, was a young Gentleman, who from a ſlender Figure, and the Recommendation of five and twenty Years of Age, promiſed himſelf ſome Succeſs among the Ladies, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the late Marriage Act. Not having ſeen a great deal of the World, his Mind was raw and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; ſtruck with Surprize at every Thing that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſered, and breaking out into idle Queſtions upon the moſt minute Occurrence. I have often obſerved, that
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0311400901:285"/>Memory is a prevailing Faculty in weak Intellects, and never fails to prove very troubleſome in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and as moſt Things, when Judgment is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are laid up in that Storehouſe without Taſte or Diſcernment, they are alſo produced in the ſame Manner; according to the old Proverb, <hi>Ill got, Ill gone.</hi> Having dabbled a little in ſome of our modern Poets, there hardly aroſe an Incident, but what our Fellow-Traveller would repeat twenty or thirty Verſes in a Breath, from Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore,</hi> the CHOICE, or ſome ſuch ingenious Work; and the Misfortune was, that what he laſt recited, opened new Traces, and he was ſure to continue, as long as his Memory ſupplied him; like the Man at a Fair, who will ſpew you up Ribband by the Yard, while there remains any in his Mouth; and this Similitude I take to be very pictureſque on the preſent Occaſion, with this Difference only, that what the latter evacuates, does not indicate a bad Digeſtion; whereas the former conſtantly diſcovers a foul Stomach, which cannot contain its Crudities; and on this Account, I take your Ribband Spewer to be much the more agreeable Fellow of the two.</p>
                        <p>The fifth and laſt of the Company (as I intend to ſay nothing of myſelf) was a perfect Contraſt to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter juſt exhibited; as the Dealer in Verſe never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any Thing of his own, this Original was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined never to make Uſe of what came from another's Imagination, but depended entirely upon his own Stock for Fame and Feputation. There is a Saying of Doctor <hi>Swift</hi>'s which, in my Opinion, would be of ſingular Uſe to many in human Life; "Never," ſays that great Genius in a Letter to a young Clergyman, <q>attempt to ſhew your Wit, becauſe it is at leaſt ten Thouſand to one that you have none.</q> To this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Gentleman I am now ſpeaking of, paid no Kind of Regard, his Imagination being conſtantly upon the Stretch to <hi>elevate</hi> and <hi>ſurprize,</hi> and <hi>all that;</hi> to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0311400901:286"/>ſtart new Turns of Fancy upon every Occaſion, and, as it is generally expreſſed, to ſay good Things. It was in vain to tell him, that it was not at all incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on him to be ſo extremely brilliant, and that his Company did not exact all that Emanation of Genius; my Friend could never be content to deliver himſelf in the ordinary Way, and you might perceive him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in deep Study to expreſs himſelf upon the moſt trivial Incident.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not trouble Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi> with any of the ſmart Prettineſſes which eſcaped from this exalted Wit, but, having now acquainted you with the Characters of the Company, I leave it to your own Imagination to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, in what Manner the Time muſt have glided away among People who were all entirely attached to their prevailing Foibles, and who thought of nothing but the Gratification of their own particular Humours. During the whole Journey the Citizen's Wife talked of nothing but her Taſte and Dignity, which the good Woman from <hi>Bath</hi> confirmed; the Verſe-Spewer thought of nothing but reciting, and the Man of Wit was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouſly new and lively. With regard to the <hi>Jew,</hi> he not only minded the Main-Chance in the Coach, but alſo at every Inn where we put up; and I remember, that at <hi>Marlborough,</hi> where we breakfaſted the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Morning, we were delayed for a conſiderable Time, till Search was made after this mercantile I i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant, who was at length found ſelling a Pair of Buckles to a Gentleman juſt arrived in a Poſt-Chaiſe.</p>
                        <p>I think, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> you have already mentioned an Attention to Self alone, as one of the greateſt Errors in Society; as it muſt be more particularly ſo, when People are tied to each other for any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0311400901:287"/>ſomething of this Nature abſolutely requiſite at preſent, if you would be kind enough to employ a leiſure Moment in this Way, it would, I perſuade myſelf, tend to promote good Manners among the People of this Kingdom, and would oblige him, who is with great Reſpect,</p>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0311400901:289"/>the <hi>French</hi> in this Particular, which I take to be a Point of ſome Conſequence, as by this we cannot be charged with the Levity of having ſervilely copied from others. We find that the Ladies among the <hi>Britiſh Picts</hi> went entirely naked, and painted their Bodies all over with the <hi>Woad</hi> already mentioned. This muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have afforded great Scope for Fancy, and in thoſe Days there muſt certainly have been many eager Rivalſhips among the Fair for Pre-eminence in point of Taſte for Painting. For as the whole lovely Body was ornamented with different Figures and ſundry various Repreſentations, according as Imagination ſuggeſted, the Variety of new Faſhions muſt have been extremely entertaining, each Fair-one being ſtudious to adapt to each different Part of the Body that Degree of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring and that Form, which muſt have proved moſt becoming; juſt as our modern Ladies adjuſt a Patch ſo as to make the Contraſt ſtriking, and give ſtronger Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to the adjacent Features. I have now by me the whole Hiſtory of a <hi>Britiſh Pict Coquette,</hi> found by a Friend of mine among ſome antient Manuſcripts, and ſent to me as a Curioſity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caſſibelana</hi> was the Lady's Name. She lived in the Capital of the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> and was remarkable for a fine Stature, and an Head of Hair of a ſurprizing Length, flowing in wanting Luxuriance down her Back. She always had at her Toilet ſome of the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite <hi>Woad</hi> that could be any where procured, and ſhe was celebrated for her curious Art in preparing it for the Purpoſes of adorning her Perſon. The <hi>Woad</hi> being of itſelf of a bluciſh Caſt, ſhe would ſometimes paint no Part of her Body, but where the Veins appeared, and to them ſhe gave ſuch a delicate Colouring, that the pure and elequent Blood as the Poet calls it, ſeemed to ſhew itſelf through her tranſlucent Skin. As ſoon as ſhe had eſtabliſhed this Faſhion, and made the reſt of her sex her Imitators, ſhe would then ſuddenly change
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0311400901:290"/>the Mode, and embelliſh her whole Body with various Devices.</p>
                  <p>On the left Side of her Breaſt ſhe would draw a young <hi>Cupid</hi> aiming an Arrow at her Heart, and on the Right a Lover languiſhing in amorous Indolence. Each Leg repreſented an Admirer kneeling at her Feet, and imploring her Compaſſion, while ſhe, with all the Complacence of ſelf-approving Beauty, let fall her Eyes with Indifference and cold Diſdain. On her Back were repreſented the emblematical Figures of a Train of Pages following her in her way with all the Officiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of careful Attendance. On other Parts of her Perſon was preſented to View, <hi>Venus</hi> in lovely Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude emerging from the Sea; the <hi>Graces</hi> were alſo to be ſeen walking Hand in Hand, their Faces brightened with Chearfulneſs and mutual Love. In this Manner ſhe would attend at public Sacrifices, where all Eyes were often fixed on her alone; and frequently the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable <hi>Druid</hi> could not avoid, even in the Fervour of his Devotion, to caſt a Glance upon ſuch an attractive Profuſion of Charms.</p>
                  <p>In this Manner <hi>Caſſibelana</hi> captivated the Hearts of all her male Beholders, who carved her Name upon every Oak in the Country, and the banks of <hi>Thames</hi> re-ecchoed to the Muſick of her Name. It was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally agreed that ſhe was the beſt Painter of her Age; her Colours were warm and glowing; her Figures bold and ſtriking, and the natural Motion of the different Parts of her Body made them appear ſtill more animated and actuated, as it were, with the animal Functions of real Life; an Advantage which the moſt admired Portraits of the moſt eminent Painters ſince her Days could never boaſt. In all public Places ſhe entirely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhined the reſt of her Sex, which made her the general Envy of the Ladies, who frequently combined in Parties of Scandal to her Diſadvantage, even though Tea was not then known in theſe Parts of the World. <hi>Caſſibelana</hi>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0311400901:291"/>was every Day pulled to pieces, according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Phraſe, and though the Ladies allowed that ſhe really had a very lively Fancy in all her Drawings, and an excellent Deſign in all her Drapery, yet they could not ſee that ſhe was ſo fine a Woman, though to be ſure ſhe had a pretty Manner <hi>in putting on her Things,</hi> for ſo they expreſſed the Covering of <hi>Woad</hi> which ſerved to conceal in ſome Meaſure the natural Superficies of her Skin. I am apt to believe that the tranſparent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchin was imagined from a Practice of this famous ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male <hi>Pict,</hi> becauſe at Times ſhe would lay on the Woad in ſuch a Manner, that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Line in his Tranſlation of <hi>Homer</hi> may juſtly be applied to it;
<q>Her Beauty ſeems and only ſeems to ſhade.</q> Upon the Whole, <hi>Caſſibelana</hi> was Leader of all the Faſhions even in <hi>Kent,</hi> the Inhabitants of which were the moſt poliſhed of all our Iſlanders, and, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> tells us, differed but little from the Manners of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> in like manner as our modern fine Ladies boaſt at preſent an exact Conformity to <hi>French</hi> Manners.</p>
                  <p>From the foregoing Account, which I have rendered as cloſe as poſſible from the Manuſcript now in my Poſſeſſion, it appears, that even in the Days of the pureſt Simplicity, Painting was the univerſal Practice; and therefore ſtrongly am I inclined to think it laudable in the amiable Sex at preſent. I am further pleaſed to ſee the Faſhions of the Ladies tending more rapidly every Day to a greater Similitude to the Cuſtoms of our Anceſtors; for it is very manifeſt that they are every Day becoming more and more naked, and it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable that they who diſplay moſt of their lovely Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies make the greateſt Uſe of Paint, which in my Opinion, is not uſed from a Motive of female Vanity, but as a modeſt and decent Covering to the Skin. I muſt, by the Way take notice that there is one Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in which the modern Practice of Painting differs from antient Simplicity. I do not find in the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0311400901:292"/>Account of any Hiſtorian, that the female <hi>Britiſh Picts</hi> applied the leaſt Tincture of the Woad to the natural Complexion of their Faces. For a Bloom and a Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Colour they truſted to Exerciſe, freſh Air, and wholeſome Diet. But as the faſhionable Vigils of Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were unknown in thoſe Days, it muſt be allowed that this is an Improvement upon the Faſhions of our Progenitors; and indeed it could not be expected that in thoſe rude Times ſo elegant a Diverſion could be known. For this we are indebted to modern Refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which has introduced Improvements in Manners, as well as in Arts and Sciences.</p>
                  <p>For my Part, I expect to ſee the Time when the Ladies will be to all Intents and Purpoſes as naked as our Anceſtors; and, in my Apprehenſion, if Things proceed with equal Celerity, the Period is not very diſtant, as their Cloaths are amazingly reduced at both Ends within theſe few Years. We ſhall not then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that the Importation of <hi>French</hi> Hoops, and <hi>French</hi> Faſhions of all Sorts, are a Detriment to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Mercers and Milliners will be uſeleſs Things, and the Ladies will ſpend the Hours of the Toilet in Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Painting, by which Means I flatter myſelf that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fair will be able to boaſt their <hi>Guidos,</hi> their <hi>Titians,</hi> and their <hi>Raphaels.</hi> To this End an ingenious Gentleman of my Acquaintance is now drawing up a Syſtem of Directions to a female Painter, which will ſerve to aid their Invention, and give them a proper Notion of Deſign and Colouring in all their Faces, by which Means it is to be hoped they will greatly excel all the boaſted Maſters in every School of Painting.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Taſte for the imitative Arts is the higheſt Embelliſhment and ultimate Finiſhing of an accompliſhed Mind; it gives an Elegance to a Man's Way of thinking, throws a Poliſh on his Manners, and by inſenſible Degrees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines the Paſſions and Affections of the Soul. It may be added, that a fine Taſte is the Inlet of ſome of the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0311400901:295"/>moſt delicate Pleaſures human Life is ſuſceptible of, and may therefore properly be called, in the Language of <hi>Shaftſourian</hi> Philoſopy, <hi>the internal Senſe,</hi> as, by Means of this Faculty, we are acquainted with many elegant Senſations, to which the Generality of Men ſeem to be entirely Strangers.

                  <p>There is nothing more common than to ſee Men, who, perceiving the Advantages which this elegant Turn gives to a choſen Few, and obſerving that Quickneſs of Senſibility for which they are remarkable, affect upon all Occaſions to be endowed with the ſame nice Faculty of Perception; but the Misfortune is, they are abſolutely callous to each fine Impreſſion, and the Method they chuſe, to convince us of their Delicacy, is by pretending, that nothing is refined enough for them. Thus, while others diſtinguiſh themſelves by yielding to the Impulſe of a Paſſion artfully excited by a Strain of Muſic, a Poem, or a Picture, theſe Gentlemen would recommend themſelves upon the Strength of their having never been pleaſed at any Rate. This Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure is for the moſt part to be obſerved in modern <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics</hi> or the <hi>Malevoli.</hi> A Piece where every Beauty of Language and Sentiment is united, where in the ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſages every Line is impaſſioned, and ſwells with the Emotion of the Soul, like Glaſs in a Furnace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Breath infuſed into it, laid before one of this Claſs, ſhall be received with cold Diſdain; and a Compoſition of <hi>Arne</hi>'s, full of all the Sweetneſs of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Expreſſion, ſhall to their finer Organs ſound like the moſt jarring Diſſonance. If a Man in a Club of Gentlemen ſhould be perpetually diſpleaſed with every Thing, while the reſt of the Members perceive no
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0311400901:296"/>Cauſe of Complaint, I apprehend there would be a ſtrong Preſumption, that his Mouth was at thoſe Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons greatly out of Taſte; and with equal Propriety, whoever boaſts an Over-refinement of Underſtanding, ſhould be ſet down, without Heſitation, as one whoſe mental Organs are diſtempered. As Matters are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently managed, a fine Taſte, inſtead of being a Power of receiving elegant Senſations, would prove an Avenue for Uneaſineſs, Diſcontent, and a conſtant Diſlike of every Thing around us; and it would fare with this exquiſite Degree of intellectual Feeling, as with him, whoſe external Senſes are framed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive acuter Impreſſions than our Employments in Life will admit.</p>

                  <p>But Nature has not caſt us in ſo delicate a Mould: Both our bodily and mental Powers are fitted to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to our Enjoyments, and are by no means contrived to be the Cauſe of Fretfulneſs, and a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant Peeviſhneſs, which ſerve only to ſour the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and become troubleſome and diſagreeable in Society.</p>
                  <p>To define a true Taſte may be unneceſſary at preſent, as it has been often done by abler Pens; but, I believe, it will be judged pertinent to the Subject in Hand, to give the Reader ſome Deſcription of it. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that many abſtract Ideas are expreſſed by Terms taken from the Perceptions of our external Senſes, ſuch as to <hi>imagine, comprehend, conceive, adhere,</hi> &amp;c. which are
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0311400901:297"/>all applied to Modes of thinking. In like Manner, the Term now in Queſtion is derived from the Senſation of our Palate, which we call Taſte, and, on account of ſome Similitude in the Operation, i applied to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Faculty by Men of Imagination in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; the Information given to the Mind being in both Caſes rapid and inſtantaneous, without waiting for the more cool and deliberate Sentence of Reflection.</p>
                  <p>Hence naturally ariſes a Diſtinction between Taſte and Judgment; which are often uſed as ſynonymous Expreſſions, but are notwithſtanding very different in themſelves. I believe, many of my Readers know Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among their Acquaintance, who, if you lay a Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before them, upon mature Deliberation, and after comparing leiſurely the Copy with their own Ideas of Nature, can pronounce the Piece to be like, without manifeſting any particular Reliſh or Pleaſure, which is always a concomitant Circumſtance with the Man of Taſte. It is he that enters into the Spirit and Stile of an Author, ſees in an Inſtant how he ſelects the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in a Deſcription, enjoys the Turn of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and his Art in ſeizing the Paſſions; and it is upon a Review of what thus ſtrikes the Mind, that the Critics of all Ages have been able to lay down Rules for Taſte; as Theories of Viſion are framed from an Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Organs of Sight, and the Manner in which external Objects operate upon them; and hence the <hi>French</hi> Wits have told us, that nothing can be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, which is not true, upon an Obſervation that the Mind turns with Diſtaſte from any Thing, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts its own Ideas.</p>
                  <p>It is recorded of <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it to the Gods as a peculiar Felicity, that he had not cultivated his Taſte for Works of Imagination, for fear they might have detained him from Objects of higher Importance; but, for my Part, I cannot help wondering that he did not rather thank Heaven for the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0311400901:298"/>elegant Turn beſtowed upon him, as it is certain that, under due Regulation, a juſt Taſte is a conſtant Source of the moſt refined Gratifications.</p>
                  <p>With this Talent, a Man may retire into his Cloſet, and there enjoy a more delicious Repaſt, and better Company, than can be met with in any modern Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. <hi>Homer</hi> never denies himſelf to any Acquaintance, and <hi>Virgil</hi> is always eaſy of Acceſs, whether you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſublime Deſcription, or the ſofter Beauties of rural Imagery. A Man may take as much Liberty with <hi>Horace</hi> as his intruding Friend did in the <hi>Via Sacra,</hi> free from the ſame Imputation of Impertinence; and, without the Expence of a <hi>Remiſe,</hi> you may viſit <hi>Boileau, La Fontaine, Vollaire,</hi> and the politeſt of the <hi>French</hi> Nation. Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> is always ready to ſhake your Sides with Humour; you may converſe with <hi>Pope</hi> without hearing him complain of Head-Aches; and if you aſpire to the Company of a Miniſter of State, you may retire with <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> into the Cabinet, there find him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing the ſecret Springs of Policy, or receive a Clue from him to guide you through the Maze of Hiſtory. In ſhort, to a Mind well harmonized, all Nature wears a pleaſing Aſpect, and the Tranſition is eaſy from a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for external Beauty, and the Pleaſures ariſing from Poetry, Eloquence, and the Arts of Imitation, to a Love for moral Perfection and the Dignity of Character.</p>
                  <p>This is the Sentiment of <hi>Cicero</hi> in the Words of my Motto, and it is enforced by the Author of <hi>The Pleaſures of Imagination,</hi> in ſuch an exquiſite Strain of Poetry, that I muſt beg Leave to conclude with tranſcribing the Paſſage. Speaking of a Man of Taſte, he has the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Lines.</p>

Of this Truth I met an egregious Proof in an Acquaintance of mine, who happened to fall into my Company a few Days ſince at the Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. While great Numbers of our Countrymen are buſied in Enquiries after Mr. <hi>Keene</hi>'s Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations at the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> to prevent the Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchantmen; while ſome are intereſted in the Election a of King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and others employed in a Diſcuſſion of the Naturalization Act; this Gentleman is entirely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted in his Speculations, and concerns himſelf in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0311400901:301"/>the Regulation of an imaginary World with more Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude, than any Politician in what is immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the Intereſt of his Country.</p>
                  <p>Upon my aſking him the ordinary Queſtion, <q>
                        <hi>What News?</hi>
                     </q> He replied, <q>There is ſomething in Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Sir, in both Kingdoms, but it has not as yet tranſpired; though I have a ſecret Channel for Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and, I believe, I am pretty well in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; both Cabinets endeavour to ſuppreſs their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, but my Information comes from the Board of Green Cloth.</q> — At this Expreſſion my Friend perceived me ſomewhat ſurprized, and he therefore thought proper to explain himſelf, <q>The Board of Green-Cloth, Sir,</q> ſays he, <q>is a metaphorical Term I generally make uſe of to ſignify what is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly call the <hi>Green Room;</hi> perhaps you never ſaw the <hi>Green-Room;</hi> it is the Place where the Performers rendezvous during the Play, and for ſome Time after it; that of <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> is in the Form of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and I'll give you a particular Deſcription of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I was reduced to a Neceſſity of mentioning, that it would be ſuperſluous to give himſelf ſo much Trouble, as that Place was as well known to me as the Coffee-Room we were in; which Hint I judged not improper, as I knew that a violent Propenſity to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription was one of my Friend's Singularities, and that he is never ſo compleatly happy as when an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offers for him to diſplay his florid Talents for this Embelliſhment of Converſation. Upon theſe Occaſions I have frequently obſerved his Eye ſparkle with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Brillancy, which never fails to be extinguiſhed whenever he is checked in his Career, as was the Caſe with him at preſent. After looking ſerious for ſome Time, he reaſſumed his Diſcourſe—<q>The Theatrical World, Sir, is nothing now to what it was formerly; the People are infatuated with <hi>Garrick;</hi>
                        <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0311400901:302"/>— He has introduced a new Taſte entirely; I could wiſh I had lived in the Days, when <hi>Lun</hi> was in his meridian Splendor; Sir, I have been delighted at a Recital of the many Feats he uſed to perform. Don't you think it muſt have given the quickeſt Senſations of Surprize to an Audience, to ſee him in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Harlequin,</hi> making his Eſcape into the Tub —(the Tub, Sir, is the Box over the Stage Door) —and when he was cloſely purſued by his Enemies, it muſt have been delightful to perceive him dart, as quick as an Arrow to its deſtined Mark, or with the Celerity of a Bird in the Air, from the Place, where the whole Houſe imagined him deſtitute of the Means of an Eſcape, into the oppoſite Box, and there ſtand laughing at his Purſuers. There was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuch an Exertion in his nervous Syſtem, that— I don't know whether you ever ſaw an Anatomy— but I can lend you an Author upon the Animal Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, from whom it will appear manifeſtly, upon the cleareſt Principles, how this was performed. It would aſtoniſh you to hear the ſeveral Accidents he met with; when he was locked in Arm over Arm, with another at the Top of a Scene, they both fell down, claſped in each other's Embrace; and how do you think he eſcaped?—with an amazing Agility he turned his Fellow-performer under him, ſo that he came down quite eaſy, while the other broke his Collar-bone.—Perhaps you never would be able to gueſs how many Steps he made in running in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Manner round the Stage; three Thouſand Steps, Sir—the Movement of each Leg was ſo ſmall and quick, that in going the Length of one Foot, he minced it ſo as to make three hundred Steps—look ye Sir <hi>(wetting his Finger)</hi> here's a Circle on the Table; and now ſuppoſe my two Fingers to be his Legs, then conceive them to move in this Manner —you ſee there's nothing ſo eaſy—they may ſay
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0311400901:303"/>what they will of the Hero of <hi>Drury Lane;</hi> he only imitates Men, whereas the <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts himſelf into a wild Beaſt, a Bird, or a Serpent with a long Tail and what not. I believe there will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done next Winter; there is a Scheme on Foot to work the little Fellow. The Thing is, we are to have an old Pantomime Entertainment, new vamped, with an additional Scene of a <hi>Scythian</hi> Winter-Piece, which I am convinced will draw the whole Town after it. There are already ſeveral Agents ſent to <hi>Ruſſia</hi> to purchaſe a ſufficient Number of Bears, and a large Quantity of Ice is now actually making. The Ice, Sir, will be diſpoſed on the Stage in large Rocks, and the Beaſts will be ſent on ſhivering amidſt the hoary Froſts; in one Part of the Scene the Sun will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, but ſhorn of his Beams, as <hi>Milton</hi> has it; the rigid Froſt will be impervious to his Rays, and you will ſee the Lightning play upon the impaſſive Ice. There will alſo be exhibited at a Diſtance a lofty Mountain, from whoſe Summit will come roaring down a tumultuous Cataract, loud, and impetuous in its Courſe, and at the Bottom will be placed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervoir to collect the ruſhing Torrent, where it will form itſelf into a ſmooth expanſive River, which is to glide off in the Sight of the Spectators. There will alſo be ſituated on the Banks of the River a Man with a Fiſhing-Rod, intent upon catching the Tenants of the watery Plain, when on a ſudden the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience will perceive the Stream arreſted in its Courſe by the Intenſeneſs of the Froſt, and the Fiſherman's Line made a Priſoner for the Remainder of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Water-fall alſo will inſtantly be ſtopp'd by the gelid Seaſon, and the Spectators will have the Pleaſure of perceiving the pendant Iſicle. This, Sir, will be performed with Eaſe, though the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its Operation will be imperceptible to the vulgar Eye. But there is no Difficulty in the Thing;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0311400901:304"/>for, as the Torrent is to come down in Sheets of Water, which will be repreſented with a gliſtening Kind of Tin, it will be extremely practicable to ſtop the Tin all at once, and in that Caſe the curious will admire the Wonders of the liquid Stone; <hi>liquidi Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racula ſaxi,</hi> you know <hi>Claudian</hi> talks of, and to all this will be added ſeveral other Ornaments that will tend greatly to heighten the Entertainment.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Theatrical Projector had gone on thus far with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Interruption, and upon my offering to make ſome Animadverſions upon his Scheme, he altered the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his Features, looked grave, and in a ſhort Time walked off without ſaying a Word. The Reaſon of this I take to be, that my Friend is never happy, but when the Company is attentive to his own Narratives. Be that as it will, I muſt own for my Part, that I ſhould be glad to ſee <hi>Harlequin</hi> baniſhed from all polite Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences to his native <hi>Sadler's-Wells,</hi> to ſee <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> triumph over every Heart, and to view both Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes ſucceeding by the Force of juſt acting, rational Performances, and a ſimple Conformity to Nature, which would introduce ſuch a Reformation in our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, as to render them of public Utility to the Morals of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> People.</p>

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0311400901:305"/>a Pair of Pumps, and a Bag-Wig out of the other; a Pair of Paſte-Buckles out of his Waiſtcoat Pocket, and a Book of Directions for Country Dances—Mr. <hi>Nankeen</hi> was ſo diſconcerted by this Accident, that he immediately returned to Town, and left his intended Partner quite forlorn at the Aſſembly, untill <hi>Nat Pigtail</hi> condeſcended to dance with her for the Remainder of the Evening.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a very particular Pleaſure to me to learn the other Morning from my Friend <hi>Wildair,</hi> that the Seaſon for Theatrical Diverſion is to commence this Evening From this Information I was inſenſibly led into ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon the Profeſſion of Playing, which has been in moſt Ages held in a lower Degree of Eſtimation than any other Occupation in Life. How this ſhould have obtained in a Point which Reaſon does not ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, is ſomewhat ſurprizing, though it may not be Matter of extreme Difficulty to trace the Error to its Source.</p>
                  <p>The Players, if I miſtake not, made their firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the World after the ſame Manner, in which the moſt abandoned and wretched of our Days make their Exit, that is to ſay, in a Cart. In this Vehicle they ſtrolled about from Place to Place, under the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Theſpis,</hi> who was their Manager; they had their Faces all bedaubed with Lees of Wine, which, no doubt, contributed not a little with other contingent Circumſtances to render them ridiculous. And indeed, in this Situation of the Drama, it is no Wonder that they were looked upon as a Set of Low Fellows. By inſenſible Degrees Matters were improved to greater Elegance, though the old Opprobrium ſtill continued to adhere to the Performers, and perhaps their own Way of Life, their own Morals, their own Behaviour, and the Appearance they every where made, deſerved, that the firſt Impreſſion ſhould not be effaced. By the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0311400901:307"/>ſame Means, the Prejudice has been derived down from Age to Age, and till within theſe few Years paſſed, the Laws, which public Opinion had eſtabliſhed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in full Force, till at Length they were repealed in Favour of the Few, whoſe Life and Converſation ſhould deſerve it. Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> talking of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Time, obſerves, <q>that as the beſt Playhouſes were then Inns and Taverns (the <hi>Globe,</hi> the <hi>Hope,</hi> the <hi>Red Bull,</hi> the <hi>Fortune,</hi> &amp;c.) ſo the Top of the Profeſſion were then meer Players, not Gentlemen of the Stage: They were led into the Buttery by the Steward, not placed at the Lord's Table, or Lady's Toilet; and conſequently were entirely deprived of thoſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they now enjoy, in the familiar Converſation of our Nobility, and an Intimacy (not to ſay Dearneſs) with People of the firſt Condition.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certain it is, the Sentiments of Mankind have been very much changed in this Reſpect of late Years, and indeed, in all Ages and among all Men of Senſe, the Prejudice never had much Weight, whenever there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared one abſtracted from the common Herd, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the other Qualities requiſite in his Buſineſs, was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a good Underſtanding, adorned and embelliſhed with Modeſty, Decency, and good Manners. Thus we find among the <hi>Romans, Roſcius,</hi> the Player, was held in general Eſteem by all Men of Taſte and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. <hi>Cicero</hi> loved him living, and at his Deceaſe paid an immortal Tribute to his Memory. He omitted no Opportunity of celebrating his Name, and in one of his moſt famous Orations, <q>Who is there, ſays he, among us of ſo rude and unfeeling a Diſpoſition, as not to have been very ſenſibly affected at the Death of <hi>Roſcius,</hi> who though he died in an extreme old Age, on Account of his excellent Art, and his every Elegance deſerved to be exempt from that Debt of human Nature." "<hi>Quis noſtrum tam animo agreſti ac
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0311400901:308"/>duro fuit, ut Roſcii morte nuper non commoveretur? Qui cum eſſet ſenex mortuus, tamen propter excellentem artem, ac venuſtatem, videbatur omninò mori non debuiſſe.</hi>
                     </q> Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi> was alſo the Friend, the Companion, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of a Set of Men, who were the chief Honour to our Country; <hi>Dryden, Pope, Rowe, Addiſon, Congreve, Steel,</hi> and the famous Doctor <hi>Radcliffe</hi> were the Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages that received him with open Arms; and if Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> ſhould never be able to boaſt ſuch an exalted Acquaintance, it is for this only Reaſon, becauſe it is hardly to be expected, that ſuch a Set of Men will again appear together.</p>
                  <p>A compleat Actor appears ſo ſeldom in the World, that I do not wonder, whenever a <hi>real Prometheus</hi> with true Fire ſtarts up among us, at the Tribute of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Applauſe, which is paid to him by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſent; and ſo many Requiſites are neceſſary to form one, who can thus extort the public Approbation, that, I own, I ſhould not be ſurprized if this Art roſe much higher in the Eyes of the Judicious. There are many external Accompliſhments, which in other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions may be diſpenſed with, but the fine Performer muſt have a well formed Perſon, a graceful Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a well turned Face, a juſt Diſpoſition of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and an Eye expreſſive of the various ſubtile Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Mind; he muſt have improved the Air of his whole Perſon by an Habitude and Intercourſe with Gentlemen; and he muſt add to all this a Voice, not only to articulate each Syllable diſtinctly and with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, but alſo to deliver each Sentence with Grace and Harmony.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe external Qualifications, what a Train of mental Endowments is abſolutely neceſſary? A good Underſtanding cultivated by a liberal Education, a true Taſte and Reliſh for all the Beauties in an Author, a juſt Senſe of every Paſſage, and the Idea appropriated to each Word, a thorough Knowledge of Character;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0311400901:309"/>an Imagination warm and alive to each fine Stroke of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oet; a Senſibility of Temper, properly ſuſceptible of each Paſſion the Writer addreſſes himſelf to, and a Power of exciting that Paſſion in others. What and how great that Power is, the following Paſſage in <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> will better convey to the Reader, than any Thing I have to offer on the Subject. <q>Is it not mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous that this Player here, but in a Fiction, in a Dream of Paſſion, ſhould ſo force his Soul to his own Conceit, that from her working all his Viſage wanned Tears in his Eyes, Diſtraction in his Aſpect, a broken Voice, and a Function ſuiting with Forms to his Conceit?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this Account, I apprehend, it muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that this Profeſſion ſhould be reckoned among the liberal and imitative Arts, and at the ſame Time I muſt obſerve, that it cannot be thought too ſlightly of in thoſe, who repeat the mere Words in a vacant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling Manner, or whoſe Art conſiſts in a wry Mouth, or a Burn on the Jaw. But when every Look, Geſture, and Action is governed by the Soul, when the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is wrapped, and the Audience catch it by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion; when the Artiſt imparts new Motions to our Spirits, wrings the Soul with fancied Grief, and fills us with imaginary Terrors, then we perceive a Genius which cannot be too much admired. I have often la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented that the Poverty of our Language does not afford a Term ſufficiently expreſſive to diſtinguiſh ſuch a Performer from the reſt of his Fraternity; as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtudy to avoid Confuſion in my Ideas, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſeperate them in my own Mind by Words which appear to me to be beſt appropriated to them, and, till a better Diſtinction is pointed out, I would chuſe to call a Perſon, ſuch as I have deſcribed, an Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator or an Actor, and he, who pretends to the Art without any Knowledge of Nature, ſhould be ſet down a <hi>mere Player.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0311400901:310"/>In this Senſe Mr. <hi>Barry</hi> will always be accounted a fine Actor, and Mrs. <hi>Cibber</hi> an Actreſs of irreſiſtible ſkill. It would not be, perhaps, unentertaining to examine the Liſt of <hi>Dramatis Perſonae</hi> belonging to each Playhouſe, and when we ſhould not find the <hi>Actor</hi> alone, it might be diverting to ſee how both are blended, and to enquire which is prevalent; but the Reader, if he approve the Hint, may purſue it in his own Imagination.</p>

They are the Words of <hi>Evander,</hi> when he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the pious <hi>Trojan</hi> Prince under his humble, but hoſpitable Roof. If I remember right, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> was an Admirer of the beautiful Simplicity of this Addreſs, As I have his Volumes at Hand, I ſhall here tranſcribe the Paſſage.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Honour our annual Feaſt, and take your Seat</l>
                     <l>With friendly Welcome at a homely Treat.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This Sentiment, however, ſhort the Tranſlation may be is highly admirable in the Original, and ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in very lively and deep Characters on every Man's Heart who is deſirous of ſharing the ſocial Pleaſures of Life.</p>
                  <p>Content is moſt certainly the ſureſt Source of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Happineſs; it not only reconciles a Perſon to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0311400901:312"/>himſelf, but alſo to thoſe with whom he converſes. To uſe <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Phraſe, it is the chief Nouriſher in Life's Feaſt, and when giddy Mirth and Noiſe have ſubſided, this keeps on an equal Tenor, and if it never riſes very high, it has at leaſt this Advantage, that it does not ebb ſo low as to leave Shoals and Rocks diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Mirth may properly be called an <hi>Aurora Borealis;</hi> whereas Good Humour, like a fixed Star, ſheds a conſtant Stream of Light, which, if it does not dazzle, has at leaſt at all Times a chearing Influence.</p>
                  <p>If good Humour has this Advantage annexed to it, Diſcontent muſt certainly be attended with many poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Inconveniences; In the ſame Proportion that Eaſe endears and enlivens our Days, its Reverſe muſt bring on each Morn in a Turbulence of Clouds; the Spirits are perpetually ſinking, and all the Uſes of this World, as the Poet has it, ſeem to him weary, ſtale, flat, and unprofitable. The Infection is always rankling in his Breaſt, and he lives in an unceaſing State of Hoſtility with himſelf and his Neighbours. This by Degrees grows into a fixed Habit, and then a lowering invariable Gloom hangs over his Mind, and as he does not feel any Peace in his own inward Frame, he is not tender about the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs he may create in another's Breaſt. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere gives an unlimited Vent to his Sullenneſs, and is ever finding fault with every Thing around him.</p>
                  <p>There is one Circumſtance which has a Kind of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to alleviate this Perverſity of Diſpoſition, and that is, that the Propenſity to Satyr, which this Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenneſs gives the Mind, is often the Occaſion of ſtarting new and uncommon Remarks. We ſometimes hear from theſe Kind of Humouriſts Strokes of a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Pleaſantry, which are not unentertaining; and as theſe People are ever fond of exhibiting a <hi>Caricature</hi> of their Acquaintances, we now and then receive ſome Sketches or Pictures in Miniature, in which the Colouring and the Drapery are ſo whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0311400901:313"/>imagined, that we really derive no ſmall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Diverſion from their extravagant Turn. But notwithſtanding this Degree of Mirth which they invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily excite, it does not ſufficiently compenſate for the Trouble they give for the moſt part. A Man, who can find no Reliſh in any Thing, ſhould be baniſhed from Society; he ſhould be ſent to an Infirmary of <hi>Valetudinarians,</hi> and there be confined until he purges away his ill Humours, or until Reaſon diſpels the Miſt which has obſcured his Intellects.</p>
                  <p>The ſure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> way of pleaſing in Company, is for a Man to be pleaſed inwardly; and he that is not ſo, ſhould retire and brood over his Uneaſineſs, and not become troubleſome, or invade the Harmony of Society. I cannot help conſidering this fixed and permanent ill Humour as a Kind of <hi>Black-Jaundice,</hi> through the dark Medium of which every Thing that paſſes takes a Tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I know a Perſon at preſent who has been in a <hi>Black-Jaundice</hi> for many Years, and he is ſtill ſuffered by his Friends to go about finding Fault, perpetually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, diſcontented, and grumbling. <hi>Sullen</hi> is his Name, and he is known by his Acquaintance to be one of the greateſt Mal-Contents in the Creation.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as Mr. <hi>Sullen</hi> wakes in a Morning, if he has had a good Night's Repoſe, <q>Damn it, he cries, what made me overſleep myſelf.</q>—He then rings his Bell; the Servant has not Wings, and of courſe does not fly to him; Mr. <hi>Sullen</hi> is then tempted to throw ſomething at the Scoundrel's Head. The next Thing the Servant is ordered to do, he performs with the utmoſt Alacrity, <q>Sirrah! Raſcal! cries <hi>Sullen,</hi> are you mad?—May be you're drunk this Morning already?—Can't you do your Buſineſs with a little Diſcretion?—You Blockhead!</q>—He then ſeats him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Breakfaſt; his Tea is intolerable, the <hi>India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhould be all ſhot dead, like ſo many Thieves; they have monopolized the Trade, and never import
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0311400901:314"/>a Grain of real Tea—And thoſe <hi>Creols</hi> too, and be damned to them! they ſend us nothing but Moloſſes for Sugar.</p>
                  <p>One of thoſe Gentlemen invited him the other Day to a Turtle-Feaſt. The Turtle was of a very great Size and accounted extremely fine, by the Connoiſſeurs in this Sort of Eating; it was dreſſed at the Owner's Country-Houſe by the moſt ſkilful Cook in <hi>London.</hi> 
                     <q>Pſhaw!

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN <hi>Virgil's Aeneas</hi> and his Friend <hi>Achates</hi> were entering the Town, which <hi>Dido</hi> was raiſing, <hi>Venus</hi> diffuſed a Cloud around her favourite Son, in order to ſecure him from every human Eye, and protect him from the Inconveniences to which he might be liable, if ſeen by the Inhabitants. This parental Care proved very uſeful to the Hero, and we find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it is practiſed by <hi>Mother Dulneſs,</hi> who never fails to manifeſt a tender concern for her choſen Sons, and accordingly they are often enveloped in a Cloud of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, which no Ray of Light can pierce, and thereby they are enabled to proceed in their Works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without Lett or Moleſtation. But though there is this Similitude in the Fate of the Favourites of the <hi>Cloud-compelling Queen of Dullneſs,</hi> and the Offspring of <hi>Venus,</hi> it is obſervable, that there is a very wide Difference in the Conduct of both. The latter, we are told, admired as he journeyed on, the Induſtry and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the People, the Plan of their Town, and the Nobleneſs of their Streets. He was highly pleaſed with the Magnificence of the Structures, and the Time he ſpent in ſurveying the Pieces of Painting in their Temple, ſhewed he had a Taſte for the fine Arts. But the <hi>Grub-ſtreet Race,</hi> behold with Envy the learned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of Genius, and from their hidden Place of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity their Malice is daily levelled at thoſe, who they know cannot detect their covered Malice, and ſuperior Merit is the Mark at which they take their envenomed Aim.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0311400901:318"/>There is however this Comfort remaining, that their Arrows are too blunt to penetrate, and the Miſt, from whence they iſſue ſerves greatly to retard their Force; by which Means they often fall to the Ground with ſhameful Debility, innocent of the Wound they were intended to inflict.</p>
                  <p>To drop the long-ſpun Allegory; the anonymous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller is the Peſt of Society, and it is with Pleaſure I have obſerved, that Lampoons of late have fallen Dead-born from the Preſs, without procuring their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors a ſingle Dinner. I was the other Day in a Pamphlet-Shop, when a Writer of Defamation came in to enquire after the Succeſs of his Production; <q>Sells middling, Sir, ſays the Shop-boy,"—"We diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of three laſt Week</q>—I muſt own I felt no little Pleaſure at the Author's Diſappointment, as I look upon an Itch of Scandal to be the ſureſt Sign of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and malevolent Temper, and I am ſorry to find that it is not always the Conſequence of Hunger and Thirſt. It aſcends higher and flouriſhes in high Life, attends the Ladies at their Toilets, give a Reliſh to their Tea, a Flavour to their Liqueurs, and every Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer takes a Jant to <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> as conſtantly as a Gameſter or a Citizen's Wife.</p>
                  <p>At the laſt mentioned Place I happened to ſpend a Week this Seaſon, and was a Witneſs to the Miſchief, which was occaſioned by the polite Sonnetteers and Epigrammatiſts, who chuſe to indulge their Wit, or rather, their Malice upon the amiable Sex. Both thoſe who cannot write, and thoſe who can, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon their Arrival in theſe Regions begin to meaſure out Syllables; the vain Poetaſter, while in the Long-Room the Company ſip Tea and Scandal, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies not the Fame of <hi>Dryden, Pope,</hi> or <hi>Young;</hi> his Brow is adorned with a fancied Laurel, and he enjoys the Pangs he has excited in ſome lovely Boſom. As duly as the Morn returns, Malice flies abroad in the Form
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0311400901:319"/>of a <hi>Rebus,</hi> a <hi>Madrigal,</hi> a Song, an Epigram, or ſome ſuch ingenious Shape. The general Curioſity is inſtantly excited, and every one is impatient to peruſe the lying Evidence of Shame. <q>Do, Colonel, ſhew it me —Captain <hi>Flimſy,</hi> can't you get me a Sight of it? Do, that's a Dear—Lord, Ma'am, an't it mighty —the Creature deſerved it—What Airs ſhe gave herſelf?—And ſuch a deal of Talk, and ſo affected —Do you think her handſome?—Well, to be ſure ſhe wore a ſweet Pair of Ruffles Yeſterday.</q>—</p>
                  <p>In this manner is dull Scandal helped about, and the more lovely and innocent the Perſon is, whoſe Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is thus invaded, the more agreeable is the Invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; the Satyr ſharpens, and the Wit refines. <hi>Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi> has every Grace of Perſon, and every elegant Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhment of the Mind; in her Eye, to uſe the Expreſſion of a fine Poet, <hi>Love ever wakes and keeps a veſtal Fire,</hi> and her Behaviour carries with it an equal Degree of good Humour and Politeneſs, flowing from good Senſe and a native Sweetneſs of Temper. <hi>Appius</hi> is aukward in his Perſon, and diſagreeable in his Aſpect; his Mind is ever on the fret, and, if engaged in a Country-Dance, he is diſſatisfied with every Thing around him, and is eternally quarrelling with the Muſic. With theſe diſagreeable Features of Body and Mind <hi>Appius</hi> applied to <hi>Muſidora</hi> to be his Partner for the Evening, which ſhe declined with great Affability and good Manners, having before experienced the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the Foibles, which have taken Root in this Gentleman's Temper. <hi>Appius</hi> immediately took fire at the imagined Affront, and full of Indignation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired home to his Lodging; there he, who never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore attempted to tag a Rhyme, inſtantly commenced Poet, and the next Day came out the anonymous Stanza, which was however found out to be the Production of <hi>Appius.</hi> The Compoſition was declared very pretty by all the Prudes and Coquettes of the Place, both Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0311400901:320"/>of Women being Enemies to <hi>Muſidora,</hi> as ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a diſcreet Medium between a giddy Freedom on the one Hand, and the reſerve of Hypocriſy on the other. The <hi>Verſes</hi> were in a little Time in every body's Hand, and <hi>Appius</hi> was declared to have a very fine Turn for Poetry. The Effect, which this Treatment had on <hi>Muſidora</hi>'s Mind, is not to be deſcribed; faded were the Roſes which before were blended with the Lilly, and that Breaſt, which was deſigned for the Seat of Love, throbbed wild with uneaſy Paſſions; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any further Vexation, her Relations were obliged in a Week's Time to fly from a Place, where Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Honour are ſacrificed to a Jeſt; where the Men take a wanton Pleaſure in Scandal, and where the Fair join in Combination againſt Truth and Virtue.</p>
                  <p>How People can thus become avowed Enemies to their own Happineſs, and ſo univerſally adopt a Cuſtom, which certainly would be more honoured in the Breach than the Obſervance, is to me highly unaccountable. It reminds me of the Licentiouſneſs uſed by the Chorus in the Infancy of the Drama, when Malice was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the room of Wit, and run a muck at ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Families, until a ſalutary Law ſtopped the Proceeding, and the Chorus, deprived of all further Power of Offence, was condemned to ignominious Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>

The famous <hi>Rochfoucault</hi> ſucceeded ſo well upon this Plan, that he is univerſally admired wherever Wit and Poignancy of Matter are reliſhed. This Scheme of Writing indulges a free roving Exerciſe of the Mind, as Lord <hi>Shaftſbury</hi> expreſſes it; it ſets us free from the Fatigue of purſuing a long and regular Tract of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted Reaſoning, and may from its appearing in looſe detached Sentences, ſeem to the Reader to carry with it no great Difficulty in the Execution, but it is nevertheleſs as hard as any other Vehicle of Inſtruction, as it raiſes a Demand for cloſe Senſe and a lively Turn
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0311400901:323"/>of Expreſſion in almoſt every Line. Hence it is, that the Writer already mentioned has been ſo much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by People of Taſte, and hence it is, that <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Swift</hi> have thought proper to follow him in this Path of <hi>Satyr.</hi> A very ingenious <hi>French</hi> Writer has alſo publiſhed, within this ſhort Time an entire Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume in this Way, abounding in excellent Reflections upon all Occurrences in Life, full of ſtrong Senſe, and highly ſpirited in the Diction. After having peruſed this Author, my Mind acquired ſuch a Habit of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this unconnected Faſhion, that I could not ſettle my Thoughts on any one Topic for the Entertainment of my Readers. Wherever I went, whether through the Streets upon ordinary Buſineſs, or into the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where at preſent, as <hi>Thompſon</hi> has it in his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Poem called <hi>Winter,</hi>

                  <head>THOUGHTS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS</head>
                  <p>A Periodical Writer, in order to procure himſelf a ſufficient Number of Readers, ſhould endeavour to render his Works agreeable to the various Palates which predominate among the ſeveral Inhabitants of this Metropolis: But though he ſhould ſeaſon his Papers to the Taſte in vogue, he ſhould not entirely give up his own Judgment: As <hi>Cowley</hi> has it, The World may ſo come in a Man's Way, that he may ſalute it, but he ſhould not go a whoring after it.</p>
                  <p>The ſevereſt Critics upon Writing are thoſe who know the leaſt of it, which is ſome Comfort to an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who lives in an Age of Envy, Malice, Ill-Nature and Detraction</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:0311400901:324"/>Dean <hi>Swift</hi> tell us, that when he was a young Man, he believed that the Reſt of the World reſembled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in talking of nothing but the laſt New Play: In this particular <hi>Ranger</hi> is perhaps too much like that great Genius.</p>
                  <p>When a Set of Bookſellers are concerned in a News-Paper, a <hi>Monthly Review,</hi> or a <hi>Magazine,</hi> they take every Opportunity in the ſaid Productions of praiſing the Works, in which they have a Property themſelves, and of decrying every Thing that may prevent an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their own Sale. Writers who are ill-uſed by them in this Shape, may enjoy always this Comfort, that were theſe People to <hi>poll</hi> in <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> their Votes, upon a <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> would be ſtruck off, as they are only <hi>Copyholders,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may know what a Gentleman thinks of you, by the Behaviour of his Servants, while they wait at Table. Theſe People are always ſuch ſincere Friends to their Maſter, and, have his Honour and Glory ſo much at Heart, that they generally place their Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Reſentments upon the ſame Object, unleſs their Judgment is handſomely bribed at the Street Door.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, you may know what the Waiting-Maid thinks of you, by the Reception you meet with from her Miſtreſs; for at preſent all young Ladies are directed in their Opinions concerning the Men by what Mrs. <hi>Betty</hi> is pleaſed to ſay at the Toilet, and if ſhe declares, <q>O Ma'am, he's a fine Man—I loves to ſee him like any Thing</q>—or, <q>Oh! the Fright —I hate the Sight of him.</q> You are ſure to find the Conſequences of it, at the firſt Meeting.</p>
                  <p>As the World goes, there is generally more <hi>Art</hi> to obtain Succeſs, than <hi>Merit</hi> to deſerve it.</p>
                  <p>Sounding Periods and pompous Expreſſions no more conſtitute a beautiful Stile, than ſtruting in <hi>Red Heel</hi> Shoes, and <hi>Gold Clock</hi> Stockings can make a graceful Walk; both may ſerve to impoſe upon the injudicious,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0311400901:325"/>but thoſe, who are acquainted with Men and Books, will always think Eaſe a very requiſite Quality.</p>
                  <p>Diſcretion has its Bounds as well as all other Virtues; and it degenerates into a Vice, if, like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, it ſwallows up the reſt.</p>
                  <p>A MOTTO for the <hi>JEWS;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>—Nos alia ex aliis in Fata vocamur.</q>
                  <p>When I reflect on the late <hi>Marriage-Act,</hi> I cannot help crying out with the Poet;</p>
                  <q>Curſe on all Laws, but thoſe which Love has made.</q>
                  <p>It is boldly remarked by a very good <hi>French</hi> Writer, that a King who does not keep a Miſtreſs is highly eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, provided he does not become a Bigot through too much Devotion.</p>
                  <p>Politicians have obſerved, that <hi>England</hi> can never be undone but by a Parliament, if that be true, what are the Addreſſes from Candidates to their Electors, but ſo many Petitions to let them have a Hand in <hi>Naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation-Acts, Jew-Bills,</hi> Taxes, and in ſhort the RUIN of their COUNTRY?</p>
                  <p>The ſureſt Way of amaſſing overgrown Riches, is by a due Government or rather Suppreſſion of a Man's own Paſſions, and artfully adminiſtering to the Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of other People's.</p>
                  <p>It is much more difficult to HEAR in Company, than to SPEAK; Every one is willing to do the latter, but few have Politeneſs enough to do the former, though it ſerves a double Purpoſe; it ſhews our Manners at the ſame Time that it improves the Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>The late Doctor <hi>Swift</hi> is not generally eſteemed as a Man; in this Point the World agrees with the <hi>Dean</hi> himſelf, who was always mortified to think himſelf of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0311400901:326"/>Every Age has a peculiar Characteriſtic to diſtinguiſh it; the laſt Century was remarkable for a comic Genius, which ſometimes run out into unwarrantable Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riancies, and a Breach of Manners; the preſent Times have acquired a politer Taſte but cannot produce any Work of Theatrical Humour. The former tranſgreſſed through an Exceſs of Vigour, the latter are decent, but they have that kind of Decency which ariſes from a Want of Power, rather than of Will, and ſhould take for their Motto the Deſcription of <hi>Eunuchs</hi> in <hi>Terence; Amatores eſſe eos maximos, ſed nihil poteſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>People of the ſame Profeſſion frequently ſpend their Time in envying each other; whereas if they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by <hi>Emulation,</hi> and each would mind his own Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, every Man would find his Account in it; as at a Gaming-Table, the Way is not to be fretting at the Cards you ſuppoſe your Adverſary may have, but to make the beſt of your own Hand.</p>
                  <p>Some People's Diſcretion is the Reverſe of Charity; it covers a Multitude of Virtues, as the latter does a Multitude of Sins.</p>
                  <p>It was well ſaid by a Gentleman at a Coffee-houſe, that the laſt Scene of a modern Tragedy is like a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary's Yard; the Players are all fixed in Attitudes.</p>
                  <p>When once a Writer is known, his Enemies all will rail at him, and his Friends will damn him with faint Praiſe, becauſe he has dared to take the Lead of them. He fares like one who meets with ſpeedy Preferment in the Army; the adverſe Part will be ſure to ſhoot at him, and his Brother-Officers will hate him for being put over their Heads.</p>
                  <p>Religion which ſhould make us live in Peace and Charity, is the Source of our moſt violent Animoſities, no one being willing to let his Neighbour worſhip the ſupreme Being according to his own Ideas, and his own Feelings, though each Perſon is reſolved to uſurp that Liberty himſelf.</p>

                  <p>Full of theſe Reflections I retired to Reſt a few Nights ſince, when, in the Hours of Sleep, my buſy Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion purſued the ſame Track of Contemplation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me the following Scene.

                  <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Goddeſſes</hi> were thus prepared for the Solemnity, <hi>Apollo,</hi> in all the Pride of manly Beauty, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Altar, and paid his Adoration. This done, the Muſes came forward in Proceſſion, and, after proſtrating themſelves in a reſpectful Manner, they mixed together in a Dance, and ſung Hymns of Praiſe in Honour of the Graces. <hi>Ducunt choreas, &amp; carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na dicunt.</hi> The whole poetic Region was exhilerated at the Sound, and every Thing, that before looked beautiful, ſeemed to glow with additional Charms.</p>
                  <p>This Part of the Ceremony being concluded, a Trumpet ſounded three Times, as a Signal for Men of Genius to make their Approach; and inſtantly a <hi>Grecian</hi> Band appeared. The moſt remarkable among them were <hi>Homer, Socrates, Plato, Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus; Ariſtotle</hi> having ſent Word that he was engaged in a <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi> and could not attend. <hi>Socrates,</hi> who, we are told, called Dancing a Sacrifice to the Graces, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately began a Movement before the Altar, and <hi>Plato</hi> ey'd him with a ſtedfaſt Look. <hi>Longinus,</hi> having acquitted himſelf in the due Forms of Veneration, fixed his Attention on <hi>Homer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucretius</hi> was Leader of the next Diviſion; he thanked the <hi>Graces</hi> for having ſcattered ſo many Flowers amidſt the Thorns, which ſhoot up in his Part of <hi>Parnaſſus. Terence,</hi> who was always an <hi>elegant Obſerver of Forms,</hi> ſeemed to receive great Delight from beholding ſo much Beauty, and he preferred his Prayer with the utmoſt Purity of Diction.</p>
                  <p>The Poſture in which <hi>Tully</hi> placed himſelf recalled
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0311400901:330"/>to my Mind the Deſcription of him in the <hi>Temple of Fame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Gath'ring his flowing Robe he ſeem'd to ſtand,</l>
                     <l>In Act to ſpeak, and graceful wav'd his Hand.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>He declared in a flowing Stile, that <q>from an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of ſurveying the Beauty of external Objects, the Mind makes an eaſy Tranſition to the Fitneſs, the Order, and Regularity of its own inward Frame, and from a View of outward Decorum it begins to acquire the ſame Correctneſs and Elegance in its own Operations; ſtudiouſly careful not to think or do any Thing unhandſomely, from whence reſults that <hi>Grace of Character,</hi> which is, in its very Nature, highly eligible and Praiſe worthy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> came forward with a modeſt Mien, and great Regularity in his Motion. He deſired to paſs all his Time with the <hi>Graces</hi> and the <hi>Muſes;</hi> and bowing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully thanked the <hi>Graces</hi> for that elegant Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, the <hi>Molle atque facetum,</hi> which they had conferred upon him. He then retired to a laureat Shade, where he almoſt hid himſelf in illuſtrious Eaſe. <hi>Statius, Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Silius Italicus</hi> endeavoured to walk in the ſame Path after him, and ſometimes they even aimed at his Footſteps, but an aukward Strut in their Gate ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it impracticable. The Goddeſſes told <hi>Ovid,</hi> that they were ſorry they could not follow him into Exile. At the Approach of <hi>Horace, Venus,</hi> and all the laughing Loves, ſmiled with peculiar Pleaſure. <hi>Tibullus</hi> was received with every Token of Affection, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he withdrew, he begged Leave to introduce Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> to their Preſence, which was granted, and accordingly Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi> had the Honour of kiſſing their Hands.</p>
                  <p>After this a Pauſe enſued in the Rites, occaſioned by the Delay of ſeveral <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> to whom a Summon had been ſent commanding their Attendance.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0311400901:331"/>They were all in a Cluſter at the Foot of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> and they at length returned for anſwer, that they did not chuſe to worſhip falſe Deities. After ſuch a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was with Surprize I beheld a certain <hi>Biſhop</hi> lay aſide his Mitre, and venerate the Pagan Goddeſſes.</p>
                  <p>Upon enquiring his Name, I found this Perſonage to be the celebrated <hi>Vida.</hi> He was followed by <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Strada, Bohours,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who were at length joined by <hi>Boileou,</hi> and <hi>La Fontaine.</hi> The former had a Degree of Severity mixed in his Smiles, and the latter was all Quickneſs, Vivacity and Wit. In Imitation of <hi>Tibullus,</hi> they begged Leave to preſent their Friends, and accordingly, <hi>Garth, Prior,</hi> and <hi>Gay</hi> were introduced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi> came down from the higheſt Eminence in <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> to pay their Reſpects, but while they were performing their Duty, I obſerved they both raiſed their Heads to look at a Part of the Heavens, where there was a diſtant Thunder. <hi>Dryden</hi> had not Money to procure a ſufficient Quantity of <hi>Frankincenſe,</hi> but the Graces accepted the Intention for the Deed, convinced by ſeveral Touches in his Works that no one had a finer Senſe of Beauty. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> advanced with his Eyes fixed upon <hi>Homer,</hi> who was then in Company with <hi>Virgil;</hi> his Look was thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but bright, and he delivered himſelf in the moſt harmonious Numbers. <hi>Addiſon</hi> followed cloſe at his Heels, and he acquitted himſelf in his peculiar Manner of giving good Senſe all the Embelliſhments of Eaſe and artful Negligence. He obſerved how much Good, Humour added to the Beauty of the <hi>Graces,</hi> and he was pleaſed to ſee them without any faſhionable Edifice of Hair on their Heads, and free from any enormous Circle of the Hoop.</p>
                  <p>By this Time a general Whiſper began to run thro' all the Ranks, owing (as I ſoon perceived) to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Dr. <hi>Swift,</hi> who approached with <hi>Cadenus</hi>
                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0311400901:332"/>and <hi>Vaneſſa</hi> in his Hand, as an Offering to the Graces. As he drew nearer, he <hi>ſucked in his Cheeks,</hi> and the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes turned to each other with a Smile. Upon his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Apology for ſome Strokes in his Works, they aſſured him that they could overlook thoſe Singularities, on Account of his other admirable Qualities; and they added, that what was formerly granted to <hi>Virgil</hi> ſhould be alſo allowed to him, <hi>viz. To toſs about his Dung with an Air of Gracefulneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lord <hi>Shaftſbury</hi> was ready to yield all Veneration to three Goddeſſes, who had always warmed his Fancy with the brighteſt Ideas. This noble Writer was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the Lord Viſcount <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> who by the Way declared himſelf an Enemy to all Forms of Worſhip. He avowed at the ſame Time, that he was readier to pay Adoration to thoſe bright Exiſtences, than to the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> on which Topics he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangued with a Roll of Periods, in which, tho' he did not advance the ſtrict Truth, he deſerved at leaſt to be called, in the Words of a witty Satyriſt, a <hi>polite Apoſtate from God's Grace to Wit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Lordſhip withdrew, and I then perceived ſome certain modern Periodical Writers entering the Temple. They approached the Altar with a College Mien, and a pompous Affectation of learned Induſtry. Though no Charge could be brought againſt them for want of Matter, their Stile appeared too elaborate, and their Words frequently formed an <hi>exotic Dialect of adventitious Phraſes,</hi> by which Means all Eaſe was diſcarded from their Writings; and where Eaſe is wanting, Grace will be always deficient.</p>
                  <p>Emboldened by the Example of my Brother Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, methought, I approached the Altar, but I was told by <hi>Euphroſyne,</hi> that I advanced with rather too great an Air of Negligence, and the Goddeſs adviſed me to avoid the Appearance of Thoughtleſſneſs, while I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be eaſy and graceful. I was ſo ſtung with
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0311400901:333"/>this Reproach, that my Repoſe was inſtantly diſturbed, and, when awakened, I pleaſed myſelf in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection that the whole was but a Dream.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Author, from whom I have ſelected the Motto of this Day's Paper, was a Poet of great Elegance, as well as a Critic of the moſt refined Taſte. He obſerves in his excellent <hi>Art of Poetry,</hi> that the Genius of Writers is frequently very unequal, their Vigour often exhauſted, and their Spirits ſunk; as if <hi>Apollo</hi> and the Muſes had quite abandoned the tuneful Breaſt; and therefore he adviſes every Author, to call off his Mind at proper Seaſons from the Studies he is employed in, in order to wait more propitious Moments, when the Return of the poetic Heat, and the Influence of the God, may render his Productions more animated.</p>
                  <p>This Precept certainly ſhould be adhered to by all, who preſume to lay their Lucubrations before the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; but it often happens, that the periodical Eſſayiſt, however inclined he may be to retouch and finiſh, is compelled by Neceſſity to diſmiſs the uncorrected Sheet to the Preſs; for though the Town may think they have a Right to an Author's whole Time, and that he ſhould grow pale at the Midnight Lamp, the better to make a Part of their Tea-Equipage in a Morning, it cannot but often be the Caſe, that Buſineſs of ſome Sort, ſocial Connections, and ſundry various Avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0311400901:335"/>ſhall obtrude themſelves, ſo as to render it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Writer to comply with that Reſpect he owes his Readers: for, as it has been wittily ſaid by Sir <hi>Richard Steel,</hi> an Adventurer in this Way, is like a Man who keeps a Stage-Coach; he muſt ſet out, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there are Paſſengers or not.</p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes, ſince the Commencement of the <hi>Gray's Inn Journal,</hi> been curious after my own Fame, and on this Account I have often ſeated myſelf in a ſnug Part of a Coffee-houſe, in Order to collect the Sentiments of the Public concerning the preſent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Upon theſe Occaſions I have obſerved, that no Allowance is made for a temporary Want of Health, an accidental Depreſſion of Spirits, to which all Men are liable at Times; and I muſt add, that it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for Readers in Coffee houſes to make any Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Severity, on Account of the Humour they may be in themſelves, their own want of Eaſe, and their uſual Cheerfulneſs. I remember to have been damned by a well looking Man, becauſe his Wine was bad the Night before, and the Fumes of it were ſtill in his Head; an uxorious Gentleman, who is ſometimes a little Henpecked by his Wife, is ſure never to reliſh me after a Curtain-Lecture; and the Price of Corn at <hi>Bear-Key</hi> has more than once lowered me in the Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a ſolid Citizen. Add to theſe accidental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies, the great Variety of Taſles, which prevall in every Company, and which it is a moral Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for any Writer to gratify at once. I have occaſionally entertained the Town with Eſſays of Pleaſantry and Humour, and the Conſequence is, that it has raiſed a Demand upon me every <hi>Saturday</hi> for an equal Vein of Mirth. Becauſe the <hi>Temple of Laverna</hi> has excited a general Laugh, it is aſked upon entering a Coffee-room, <q>Waiter, has Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi> given us any more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached Scenes to Day?" "Is there any Thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſly high?" "O! this is againſt Suicide, there
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0311400901:336"/>is no Fun here,</q> ſays another; and a third exclaims, <q>Pſhaw! this Man is always laughing—can't he be ſerious a little, and give us ſomething that has Stuff in it—Eſſays on Taſte, and Poets, and Humouriſts, and Monkeys, and Stile! Here, Boy, give me the <hi>Gazetteer;</hi> or the <hi>London-Daily Advertiſer,</hi> which ever is out of Hand.</q>—A Correſpondent, who writes to me from his Houſe near <hi>Litchfield,</hi> begs to know, why I have entirely diſcarded Politics, and has the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paragraph—<q>Why won't you have a Fling at the Times?—A Touch now and then upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and a Stricture upon the Conſtitution would have a pretty go down with us in the Country.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As it is now conſidently afferted that the <hi>Jew-Bill</hi> will be repealed, I have reſolved with myſelf to be a Tool to no Party whatever, and as to the Care of our Conſtitution, I heartily recommand it to thoſe, who are entruſted with it.</p>
                  <p>"Videant Conſules, ucquid detrimenti Res Publica capiat."</p>
                  <p>This Paper was undertaken to contribute, as far as the Author's Time and Abilities would permit him, to the Entertainment or Inſtruction of his Readers; to laugh out of Countenance many of thoſe Foibles, which are apt to ſhoot up in this Metropolis; to amuſe the Fair, to promote Decency and good Manners, and to detect Impoſtors in Writing, Criticiſm, and many Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Life. That this has ſucceeded far beyond his warmeſt Hopes, he is not backward to acknowledge; he thinks himſelf obliged to his candid Readers for the ſavourable Reception, they have hitherto been pleaſed to afford to the Production of his leiſure Hours, and, though he is not inclinable to arrogate to himſelf any Vanity on this Head, he is notwithſtanding pleaſed, in a particular Degree, to find that this, his firſt Attempt, has gone on with growing Reputation, from the firſt Out ſet, to this preſent <hi>Saturday,</hi> without anticipating
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0311400901:337"/>the public Favour by Puſſs in the News-Papers, or by the Addreſs of Emiſſaries, who ſhould conſidently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that it was to be the joint Labour and Production of ſome of the beſt Writers of the Age; without a Combination of Bookſellers to ſupport it by a Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without the Patronage of any great Man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The Author always diſdained ſuch little Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſices, well knowing, that if he had any Wit to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him, the Public would return a Degree of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in Proportion to their Entertainment; and on this Account; he has never been ſo induſtrious to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, that a very eminent Hand was engaged; that Sir <hi>Gecrge</hi> ***** wrote ſuch an Eſſay; that my Lord ***** diverted the Choice Spirits ſuch a Day; that the laſt was very ſine, and came from the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able *****; that the Author of ***** contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the exquiſite Entertainment in ſuch a Piece, and that Mr. ***** the Tranſlator of ***** was certainly one of the Gentlemen concerned in it, and that his Stile could be eaſily traced in the reſpective Pieces belonging to him.</p>
                  <p>Without theſe Advantages, the <hi>Gray's-Inn Journal</hi> has found the Way to amuſe the Town once a Week for twelve Months paſt, and, I may boaſt, with perhaps ſewer voluntary Supplies than is generally afforded to Authors on theſe Occaſions.—However, as I am not inclined to aſſume to myſelf any <hi>Praiſe,</hi> that my own Conviction does not tell me, is properly mine, I muſt here let the Public know that there is a Perſon, to whom I am frequently obliged for all the Aſſiſtance he can contribute. I ſhall not mention his Name, as I am perſuaded, it would not be agreeable to one of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and delicate Senſe of Things; thus much I will hint, that this Perſonage is no other than the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor of the Preſs, who, finding that my Occupations will not permit me to reviſe the Paper myſelf, is kind enough upon ſeveral Occaſions to alter Words and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0311400901:338"/>according to his own Taſte, and whenever a Phraſe does not entirely pleaſe him, the Reader, is ſure to ſee ſomething ſubſtituted in its room; for Inſtance, I had Occaſion to mention ſome Time ſince, <hi>a Treaty of Marriage,</hi> which this Gentleman converted into a <hi>Treatiſe of Marriage,</hi> and the Reader's own Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will point out to him ſeveral Elegancies of this Nature upon other Occaſions; all which Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Stile, I beg, may be invariably attributed to the abovementioned Compoſitor of the Preſs, of whom I ſhall ſay no more at preſent; but as the Printer's Devil is now with me for this Lucubration, I ſhall conclude with a Return of my ſincere Thanks to the Public, for the Encouragement they have afforded me during the Courſe of this Volume, with a grateful Senſe of which I here take my Leave, and remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til next <hi>Saturday,</hi> the candid Readers,</p>
