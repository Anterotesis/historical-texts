            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>DEDICATIONS are generally meant to to do honour to the Patron, by revealing their private virtues, or recording their public merits. But neither of theſe ſubjects occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the preſent addreſs; for while the undivided applauſe of a nation, proclaims the latter, my ſmall plaudit muſt be loſt, in the general voice; and while the friendſhip and eſteem, of ſo many of the firſt perſonages of the age, are, at once, the ſtrongeſt teſtimony, and moſt pleaſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, of the former, my ſimple concurrence muſt be deemed ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>To neither of theſe motives, then, is to be attributed my publicly placing this play, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

your patronage; but to a deſire of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging my gratitude, for the great trouble you have taken with it, and of indulging a much higher vanity, than that of being its author; by declaring to the world, that you are my friend, and that I am,</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE hint of this comedy was taken from a much admired performance of Monſieur <hi>Beaumarchais,</hi> ſtiled <hi>Eugenie,</hi> which Mr. Garrick was ſo kind to put into my hands, ſome time ago. I was immediately ſtruck with the elegant ſimplicity of language, and ſentiment, which cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterizes that work, and which, indeed, ſhould do the ſame, in all dramatic writings, where neither the perſons, or ſituations of the drama, are elevated above the common degrees of life.</p>
            <p>I immediately adopted the plan, and ſet about adapting it to the Engliſh Stage. But, as I proceeded in this work, I found I had great difficulties to encounter; for, though Monſ. <hi>Beaumarchais</hi> had laid the ſcene of his play, in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he had, unluckily, adopted Spaniſh manners. This circumſtance appeared an unſurmountable obſlacle to me, and I ſhould have immediately relinquiſhed all hopes from my project, if Mr Garrick had not, in the moſt friendly manner, lent me his aſſiſtance, to overcome this otherwiſe inſuperable difficulty.</p>
            <p>How far I have ſucceeded, in rendering this piece worthy of the Engliſh ſtage, muſt be left to the candor of the public. I ſhall only add, that the characters of <hi>Frampton, Willis, Loyd,</hi> I may add Mrs. <hi>Winifred,</hi> alſo, are of Engliſh growth. The character of Lord <hi>Euſtace,</hi> too, has receiv'd ſome additions; and I hope that his compunction, for the crime he had committed, will render him more worthy the favour of a Britiſh audience, whoſe generous natures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not brook the repreſentation of any vice, upon the ſtage, except in order to have it puniſhed, or reclaimed. As the ſituation of <hi>Harriet</hi> would not admit of any change, I have not attempted to deviate from the gentle, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting <hi>Eugenie,</hi> of Monſieur <hi>Beaumarchais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had written thus far, before I could have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the very kind and favourable reception, with
<pb facs="tcp:0072601800:5"/>
which the public have honoured this piece; and I think myſelf extremely happy, at having this opportunity of aſſuring them, that I ſhall ever retain the moſt grateful ſenſe of their indulgence to me.</p>
            <p>I am particularly bound to Mrs. Clive, on this occaſion, who undertook the ſtudy of a new part, at a time when ſhe had determined to quit the ſtage, and whoſe kindneſs to the author, and attention to the public, made her hazard her health, by performing it—I need not ſay how well—when her phyſicians would have confined her to her chamber.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge myſelf alſo much obliged to the reſt of the performers in my play, for having acquitted themſelves ſo much to the advantage of the piece, and the approbation of the public; to whom I have the honour to be,</p>

                  <p>A pretty alliance, truly, for my niece, and your daughter. But let me tell you, Sir, if Harriet had not a ſhilling, her family and her beauty wou'd intitle her to a much better match, than your colonel; who has nothing but an old tottering caſtle, a ſcarlet coat, and a ſword, to ſettle, by way of jointure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Wm.</speaker>
                  <p>Your abſurdity diſtracts me. What has your family and beauty done for you? And I dare ſay, you once rated them as high, as you do Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet's.</p>

                  <p>You'll pardon me, brother, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand genealogy better, than ſo—tho' there is not a very great difference, between my niece's years, and mine, ſhe has one generation more, in her table, than I; which, let me tell you, is of no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, to thoſe who know how to ſet a proper value, upon family.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Wm.</speaker>
                  <p>Family! Nonſenſe! Let thoſe who have no other merit to ſupport them, build on that; but, know, that I deſpiſe it; and to make an end of this ridiculous altercation, for ever, I ſhall inform you, that eight years ago, when Harriet was but a child, and the colonel was ſent young abroad,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0072601800:18"/>
to ſerve his country, I liked him ſo well, that I promiſed his father, if the young fellow return'd, with life, and honour, my daughter ſhou'd be his.</p>

                  <p>Lady Anne's large fortune was rather a deſirable object, to my father—he did, therefore, propoſe my paying my addreſſes to her; but, upon my declaring, that love ſhould be my firſt motive, in an engagement of that nature; and that my heart had never given me the leaſt hint of her lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he had the goodneſs to ſacrifice his project, to my happineſs.

                  <p>Your lordſhip has taken more pains than was neceſſary, to explain this matter to us.

                  <p>That may not be quite the caſe, neither, Sir William. But I ſhou'd not have mentioned this matter to you, if I had not thought it had been all above-board, between him and you, for Harry was never kept under hatches, I know.—But, never fear, man, keep a ſtout heart, and I warrant you he ſhall weather it; he ſhall not loſe his commiſſion.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Win.</speaker>
                  <p>I fancy, Sir, it may require the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, of a perſon of rather more conſequence, than you, to preſerve it. But there are ſuch, who are ready to intereſt themſelves, for any one who belongs to my family; the Ap Evans's are neither unknown, nor unallied, to the nobility.</p>

                  <p>It is very odd, that lord Euſtace ſhou'd diſown it to me, and yet, 'tis certain, that he did ſo.</p>

                  <p>That may be poſſible; but I, who am, every day, at his father's, and have ſeen the liveries, equipage, and jewels, brought home, for the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, cannot eaſily be perſuaded, that all this rigging ſhou'd be prepared, before there is a bottom on ſtocks, for it.</p>

                  <p>There is ſomething, very ſingular, in this affair of lord Euſtace.—My ſiſter's abſurdity, in denying the fact, I can account for, from the peculiar obſtinacy of her character. But why ſhould Harriet be affected with it? Her aunt's folly may have operated there, alſo; perhaps perſuaded her, that his lordſhip's common addreſs of galantry and politeneſs, was a profeſs'd declaration of paſſion for her. But this marriage will ſoon put an end to ſuch illuſion, and reſtore my child to her ſenſe, and duty, again. I will, therefore, go now, and ſooth, not wound her mind, with my ſurmiſes.—The ſoibles of youth, ſhould be rather counteracted, than oppoſed, leſt, in endeavouring to weed them out, we may deſtroy a kindred virtue.</p>

                  <p>O Harriet! What a diſappointment is mine? I hoped to have ſeen you united to a man of ſenſe, and worth, who wou'd have reſpected, as well as loved you—Inſtead of that, you are now joined to one, who, from his too intimate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the vicious part of your ſex, is likely to deſpiſe them all.</p>

                  <p>It is for Mrs. Winifred, Sir; and as to Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, he was the mock-doctor, the counterfeit parſon, that married my lord; I was only the clerk, indeed, Sir; and I hope your honour will be ſo good to forgive me, and not leave all the ſin, and the ſhame, too, upon my poor conſcience.</p>

                  <p>A Spaniard, you may gueſs, by the name, had a deviliſh mind to come off with me, as ſhe ſaid, to ſee foreign parts—But I weigh'd anchor, ſlily, one moon-light night, and left the poor ſigniora on ſhore—But all men have not the gift of diſcretion: tho' I was a younker, then, Harry, not much turn'd of thirty, I'll aſſure you—</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, I did hear, afterwards, that there was a ballad made about it, intitled <hi>The Cruel Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Garland,</hi> and ſet to a very woeful tune—I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0072601800:72"/>
laugh at theſe things, Harry; but I find you are a truer lover, and have come here, in ſpite of wind and tide, in purſuit of your miſtreſs—You can't expect, however, that Sir William will be highly delighted, if you ſhou'd happen to make a loſing voyage of it.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, if your miſtreſs be well freighted, a ſixty thouſand pounder, or ſo, he will have no objection, I ſuppoſe.—But come, my boy, tell me a little about it: is ſhe maid, or widow, Harry? I like to hear love-ſtories, mightily.</p>

                  <p>She is a maiden, young, and beautiful, and of a rank and fortune, beyond my expectation, captain. We have lov'd one another, long; her guardians are upon the point of diſpoſing of her, to another; ſhe has deſir'd me to free her from their tyranny, and accept of her hand, as my reward—Glorious recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence!—</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Harry! this is running before the wind, with a vengeance—Not ſo faſt, not ſo faſt, my boy, you go at the rate of twelve knots, an hour—This ſtory ſounds a little romantic, tho', and puts me in mind of the lady, that the flying man comes to ſave from the monſter.—But 'tis odd enough, that I ſhou'd not know this lady; prithee, Harry, what's her name?</p>

                  <p>Your own baſe heart, and my much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd honour; which calls upon you, now, for juſtice.</p>

                  <p>So then, I find the pride of injur'd vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, was aſſumed—Your daughter would ſecure me, by compulſion—But I deſpiſe aſſaſſins!</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Sir Wm.</speaker>
                  <p>Do not, my lord, inſult my patience, farther; I did not know you were without a ſword: on that account, I put up mine; but know, young man, I ſhall not reſt, till it has done me juſtice.</p>

                  <p>Sir William, tho' I cannot pretend to juſtify the injuries I have done your daughter, I neither muſt, nor will be compell'd, to make the reparation; I ſhou'd, indeed, be unworthy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her huſband, if fear cou'd make me ſo.</p>

                  <p>At the firſt hour you ſaw her, Sir, I ſhou'd have deemed you ſo—'Tis not your birth, young man, can varniſh over vices, ſuch as yours—Your rank renders them the more obnoxious.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, hey-day, Sir William! What wind's a blowing, now? You ſeem to have caſt anchor, when I thought you were putting out to ſea.—Here is the whole crew aſſembled; Miſs Winifred, and all.—Do women fight duels? If I had them on board the Dreadnought, I'd clap them all under hatches, before ſhe engaged.—But come along, baronet, you don't mean to ſlack ſail, now, I hope—I thought, by this time, we ſhou'd have made a few eyelet holes, in the enemy's rigging.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>I hope, my good friend, you will excuſe my ſeeming inattention, to your impatient bravery, when I tell you, that our conteſt has ended happily, and that you may now wiſh all this company, as well as lord Euſtace, joy.</p>

                  <p>Yes, when you tell truth, captain—But, at preſent, you happen to be a little out, in your ſoundings, for the ſhip's name is not the lady Anne, but the lovely Harriet—The country girl, you talked of.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, well, all is one to me.—So ſhe is bound for the port of matrimony, I am content—

            <l>I LONG to know, dread Sirs, with due ſubmiſſion,</l>
            <l>How you approve me, as a <hi>politician?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The thought was mine.—I told the ſcrib'ling dame,</l>
            <l>This part of <hi>Winifred,</hi> is much too tame;</l>
            <l>Aſk but the town, ſaid I, they'll all agree,</l>
            <l>That a <hi>tame</hi> character, will not ſuit <hi>me:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I hate ſuch lifeleſs, water-gruel ſtuff;</l>
            <l>Quicken her well, with politicks, and ſnuff:</l>
            <l>Small quantities of both, will be but teizing;</l>
            <l>Give them enough, and ſet the town a ſneezing.</l>
            <l>Her ſcribbling vanity at this was ſtung;</l>
            <l>Would have diſputed—Hold, ſays I, you're wrong,</l>
            <l>Don't be ſo raſh, to draw on <hi>me,</hi> your tongue;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>I have a weapon,</hi> ſhould I take the field,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>A better, never did a woman wield;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>You'll find, when once my paſſion is afloat,</l>
            <l>The ſoul of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in a petticoat!</l>
            <l>"Aye, but," ſays ſhe, "in politicks there's danger,</l>
            <l>"To courts, and ſtate affairs, I'm quite a ſtranger."</l>
            <l>So much the better, thou moſt ſimple woman,</l>
            <l>Blunders, in politicks, are not uncommon.</l>
            <l>When you miſtake, the town will think you clever,</l>
            <l>Think that you mean great folks, and clap, for ever;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Old England,</hi> like a boy, loves wicked fun,</l>
            <l>Abuſe your betters, and your work is done.</l>
            <l>Small game the Engliſh ſpirit will not follow,</l>
            <l>'Tis at the nobler chace, you whoop, and hollow!</l>
            <l>O'er hedge, and ditch, you helter ſkelter fly.</l>
            <l>Start but a <hi>ſtateſman—</hi>Yoax! the hounds full cry!</l>
            <l>To pick up leſſer game, you will not ſtay,</l>
            <l>While the <hi>fox</hi> runs, the <hi>hare</hi> may ſteal away;</l>
            <l>Our auth'reſs is the <hi>hare—</hi>who trembling ſits,</l>
            <l>'Till ſhe eſcapes this dreadful <hi>pack of wits;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>She hopes you will not hunt her, ſhe's ſo ſmall,</l>
            <l>But <hi>hark</hi> to mercy, as the nobleſt call.</l>

            <head>AN EPILOGUE, Written by HENRY JAMES PYE, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </head>
            <lg>
               <l>WELL! after much perplexity and rout,</l>
               <l>At length the wiſhed-for wedding's brought about.</l>
               <l>A fooliſh girl! ſo near to throw away</l>
               <l>Love, rank, and reputation, in a day.</l>
               <l>And all for what? from prejudice, in truth,</l>
               <l>Tho' chriſtened delicacy, now, forſooth.</l>
               <l>If (ſentimental nonſenſe thrown aſide)</l>
               <l>To cards, and politics, ſhe had applied,</l>
               <l>For common cares, her ſoul had been too great,</l>
               <l>And only felt an ardor, for the ſtate;</l>
               <l>Had glow'd alone with freedom's glorious flame,</l>
               <l>And next to PAM's, had honour'd PAOLI's name.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Twice in our annals, baffled France and Spain</l>
               <l>Have wept the glories of a female reign:</l>
               <l>With great ſucceſs I think we now might try</l>
               <l>The influence of a female miniſtry.</l>
               <l>In private life how well we're uſed to ſway,</l>
               <l>More huſbands know, than you'll perſuade to ſay;</l>
               <l>And how finances properly to rule,</l>
               <l>All ladies learn, who ever kept a pool.</l>
               <l>Ye generous ſpirits, who approve my plan,</l>
               <l>And wiſh at leaſt an equal ſway with man,</l>
               <l>(And ſome malicious wits ſo bold we find,</l>
               <l>To ſay this comprehends all woman-kind)</l>
               <l>In favour of a female bard, to-night,</l>
               <l>Boldly aſſert <hi>a Briton's deareſt right;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>From man, from haughty man's tyrannic laws,</l>
               <l>To your deciſion ſhe ſubmits her cauſe;</l>
               <l>Reſts, on your candor, all her hopes and fears,</l>
               <l>And only claims<hi>—a Trial by her Peers.</hi>
