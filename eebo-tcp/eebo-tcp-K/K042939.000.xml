            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following Legend having been read to a ſmall Circle of ſelect Friends, one Lady, with great Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Manner, aſked the Editor, to whom he intended to dedicate it? He replied, with Truth, that he had not yet determined. "To whom," added ſhe, <q>can you ſo properly addreſs it, as to <hi>Him,</hi> whoſe Image cleaves to us during the Recital; <hi>Him,</hi> to whom we owe a livelier Idea of RICHARD the <hi>Third,</hi> than either Hiſtorian or Painter ever gave; <hi>Him,</hi> whoſe Judge ment and Powers of Execution keep Pace with the fine Imagination of that <hi>Poet,</hi> whom <hi>He delighteth to Honour?</hi>
               </q> Theſe were nearly her exact Words, and the Editor pleads them in Excuſe for the Liberty he now takes of dedicating this Poem, With great Reſpect and Eſteem, TO DAVID GARRICK, Eſq.</p>

            <p>THE following Poem fell into the Editor's Hands by a peculiar Means, which he is not at preſent permitted to reveal. He hopes the Singularity of the Story, and the moral Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, which ſo obviouſly and ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates THE DUTY OF A PATIENT SUBMIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SION TO THE DESTINATIONS OF PROVIDENCE, IN ALL VICISSITUDES AND AFFLICTIONS OF LIFE, will juſtify his giving it to the World. He judged it too curious to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt; and his Deſire to preſerve it,

induced him to collect, and ſcatter in Notes throughout the Work, ſuch curious Particulars as (in his Judgment) prove the actual Exiſtence of ſuch a Perſon as RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and the chief Event of his Life to have been inconteſtibly certain.</p>

GEORGE BUCK, Eſq. Compiler of the Life of RICHARD the <hi>Third,</hi> in KENNET's Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> ſays, it rather ſhould be called, PLANTAGENEST, being derived from the two Words, <hi>Planta Geneſta</hi> or <hi>Geniſta,</hi> that is, the Plant, <hi>Broom.</hi> It was firſt given to FULKE, Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who lived an hundred Years before the Norman Conqueſt. He, having been guilty of ſome enormous Crimes, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, by Way of Penance, to go to the Holy Land, and ſubmit to a ſevere Caſtigation. He readily acquieſced, dreſſed himſelf in lowly Attire, and, as a Mark of Humility, wore a Piece of <hi>Broom</hi> in his Cap, of which Virtue this Plant is a Symbol, in the Hyeroglypick Language; and VIRGIL ſeems to confirm it, by calling it <hi>humilis Geniſta, the humble Broom.</hi> This Expiation finiſhed, FULKE, in Remembrance of it, adopted the Title of <hi>Plantageneſt,</hi> and lived many Years in Honour and Happineſs. His Deſcendants accordingly inherited the Name, and many ſucceſſive Nobles of the Line of <hi>Anjou</hi> not only did the ſame, but even diſtinguiſhed themſelves by wearing a Sprig of <hi>Broom</hi> in their Bonnets.</note>

                        <p>The following is ſtill to be found in the old Regiſter of the Pariſh of <hi>Eaſtwell.</hi>

                        <p>"RICHARD PLANTAGENET was buryed the 22d Daye of <hi>December,</hi> 1550."</p>
                        <p>This laſt Piece of Intelligence was tranſmitted to the Editor by a very ſenſible and worthy Clergyman now living, who kindly went from <hi>Wye</hi> to <hi>Eaſtwell,</hi> to collect as many Circumſtances as he could, to confirm the Authenticity of this ſingular Story. To the Tranſcript of the Regiſter he ſubjoined as follows:</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>It is obſervable that in the old Regiſter there is prefixed to the Name of every Perſon of <hi>noble Blood</hi> ſuch a Mark as this, <figure/>. At the Name of RICHARD PLANTAGENET there is the ſame Mark, (and it is the Firſt that is ſo diſtinguiſhed) only with this Difference, that there is a Line run acroſs it, thus <figure/>.</p>
                           <p>There is ſtill remaining in <hi>Eaſtwell-Park</hi> the Ruin of a Building, which, they ſay, was his Houſe; and a Well near it, which, to this Day, is called PLANTAGENET's Well.</p>
                           <p>There is alſo a Tomb in the Wall of <hi>Eaſtwell-Church,</hi> under which he is ſaid to be buried, but it appears to me of much older Date.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>The Editor of this Poem holds it incumbent on him to return his moſt grateful Thanks to the Gentleman who ſent him theſe curious Particulars, for the Trouble he took, and the Politeneſs of his Letter; the whole of which he ſhould be proud to make publick, together with the Name, could he preſume ſuch a Liberty to be warrantable.</p>
                        <p>The Editor conjectures the Line, which is mentioned to run acroſs the Mark of Nobility, to be what is ſtiled in Heraldry, <hi>the Bar of Baſtardy.</hi>
