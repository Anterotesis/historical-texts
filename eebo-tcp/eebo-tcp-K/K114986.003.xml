            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is but juſtice, my dear TOM, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to you a work which was begun with your approbation, carried on under your improving ſtrictures, and has ſo often amuſed us during the many pleaſing hours we have paſſed together.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time that I own the many advantages I have reaped from making you confident to the productions of an idle and rural pen; let me not fail in my acknowlegements to our common friend the Hon. DAINES BARRINGTON, who, with unremitting ardor, and with an honeſt freedom, has favored me with the moſt inſtructive hints on the ſubject of the following ſheets.</p>
            <p>Would! would to Heaven that I was capable of adding the third to the number! But the grateful tribute of a
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1199500103:4"/>ſigh is all I can give to what is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come only an inſtructive memory. Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of manners, zealous friendſhip, the promotion of all liberal arts, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal benevolence, with its amiable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant charity, characteriſed the Prelate whoſe loſs I deplore. You I know will excuſe theſe expreſſions of ſenſibility, when you recollect it is Dr. LITTLETON, late Biſhop of CARLISLE, whom I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <head>REPTILES.</head>
                  <p>WE are now to conſider the claſs of reptiles, which are, for the moſt part, objects of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation; but however the opinion of the world may be, if a writer undertakes a general hiſtory of animals, he muſt include them: they form at leſt one link in the chain of beings, and may therefore be viewed with a degree of pleaſure by a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic eye.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding the prejudice againſt this claſs is almoſt univerſal, is it founded on reaſon? In ſome it may be owned that the outward form is diſagreeable, while the noxious qualities of others are juſtly productive of terror: but are we on that account to reject them? The more fatal they are, the more deeply we ſhould enquire into their effects, that we may be capable of relieving thoſe who are ſufferers, and ſecure others from the ſame misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But if we duly weigh their noxious qualities, we ſhall, with our moral poet, find
<q>
                        <hi>All partial evil univerſal good.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The teeth of wild beaſts, and of ſerpents, are not only created as inſtruments of vengeance, but are ſalutary in leſſening the numbers of thoſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals which are highly uſeful in the degree, and only hurtful in their exceſs; but if their bad qualities are ſerviceable, we are more indebted to their good ones than we chuſe to acknowlege.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="x" facs="tcp:1199500103:8"/>But many of the animals that form this claſs are of immediate benefit to mankind. The Turtle, or Sea-Tortoiſe, ſupplies the torrid zone with a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and delicious food, as the epicures of our own country can atteſt. Frogs are a food in ſeveral parts, as Lizards and Serpents are in others.</p>
                  <p>The medicinal virtues of the Viper are partly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded by the moderns, but time, the overthrower of ſyſtems, as well as empires, may reſtore it to the rank it held with the antients. The <hi>Lacerta Scincus</hi> is, however, yet eſteemed in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> for its ſalubrious qualities, and even Toads have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the eaſe of patients in the moſt inveterate of all diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Had I followed <hi>Linnaeus,</hi> and included the Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous Fiſh in this claſs, there would have been ample room for panegyric, for it is very doubtful whether any are pernicious; but the uſes of many, either as food or for mechanical purpoſes, were never queſtioned.</p>
                  <p>But if the external figure of the reptile tribe is diſguſting, they have one general beauty, an apt configuration of parts for their way of life, nor are they deſtitute of their peculiar graces: the fine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of plates in the ſhell of the Tortoiſe, with the elegant ſymmetry of their colors, muſt ſtrike even common obſervers, while the eye of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Toad has a luſtre denied to more pleaſing forms. The frolicſome agility of Lizards enlivens the dried banks in hot climates, and the great affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſome of them ſhew to mankind, ſhould farther engage our regard and attention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:1199500103:9"/>The wreathing of the Snake, with the vivid die of its ſkin, are certainly graceful, tho' from the dread of ſome particular ſpecies which are venemous, we have acquired an antipathy for the whole. The antients, who conſidered the Serpent as an emblem of health, could aſſociate pleaſing ideas with this animal. We therefore find it an ornament at every entertainment, and in every ſcene of mirth, both in painting and in ſculpture. <hi>Virgil</hi> adopted this notion, and has accordingly deſcribed it with every beauty both of form and color,

                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1199500103:12"/>He deſcribes them as having ſeven ſpiny or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ridges running from the head to the tail, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the upper part of the back into equal parts.</p>
                     <p>The fore legs, as appear by his figure, are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably long and narrow, flat, ſmooth, and fleſhy, being deſtitute of ſcales. The color of their upper ſide bluiſh, their under ſide, as well as that of the neck, ruddy, ſpeckled with black.</p>
                     <p>We ſuſpect an error in the number of the hind legs, the figure being repreſented with four, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs we never have met with in any of this genus.</p>
                     <p>The head is painted extremely ſmall, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſize of the animal, whoſe length was ſix feet nine inches, <note place="margin">Size.</note> and breadth from the tip of one fore leg to that of the other ten feet four inches.</p>
                     <p>The covering of this ſpecies is compared to that of the <hi>Teſtudo coriacea</hi> of <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> which has an integument reſembling a tough ſtrong hide; and what is very ſingular, neither that of the <hi>Corniſh</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, nor yet that of the <hi>French</hi> naturaliſt, ſeem by the figures to be divided into angular compartments by tranſverſe ſutures, like the ſhells of all tortoiſes we have ever met with.

                     <p>Its ſpring or power of taking large leaps is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably great, and it is the beſt ſwimmer of all four-footed animals.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1199500103:18"/>ſwagging, and ſwelling out; the legs ſhort, and its pace labored and crawling: its retreat gloomy and filthy: in ſhort, its general appearance is ſuch as to ſtrike one with diſguſt and horror; yet we have been told by thoſe who have reſolution to view it with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that its eyes are fine: to this it ſeems that <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> alludes, when he makes his <hi>Juliet</hi> remark, Some ſay the lark and loathed toad change eyes.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1199500103:19"/>powers, and made it a principal ingredient in the incantations of nocturnal hags:
<q>
                           <l>Toad that under the cold ſtone,</l>

                     <p>We know by the poet that this charm was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a deſign of the firſt conſideration, that of raiſing the dead from their repoſe, and bringing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of <hi>Macbeth</hi> a hateful ſecond-ſight of the proſperity of <hi>Banquo</hi>'s line.</p>
                     <p>This ſhews the mighty powers attributed to this animal by the dealers in the magic art; but the powers our poet indues it with, are far ſuperior to thoſe than <hi>Geſner</hi> aſcribes to it: <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s witches uſed it to diſturb the dead; <hi>Geſner</hi>'s, only to ſtill the living, <hi>Ut vim coeundi ni fallor, in viris tollerent.</hi>

                     <p>We may add here another ſuperſtition in reſpect to this animal: <note place="margin">Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</note> it was believed by ſome old writers to have a ſtone in its head, fraught with great vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues medical and magical: it was diſtinguiſhed by the name of the Reptile, and called the <hi>Toad-Stone, Bufo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Crapaudine, Krottenſtein;</hi>

                        </note> but all its fancied powers vaniſhed on the diſcovery of its being nothing but the foſſil tooth of the <hi>ſea wolf,</hi> or of ſome flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toothed fiſh, not unfrequent in our iſland, as well as ſeveral other countries; but we may well excuſe this tale, ſince <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has extracted from it a ſimile of uncommon beauty:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1199500103:20"/>
                        <q>
                           <l>Sweet are the uſes of adverſity,</l>
                           <l>Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</l>
                           <l>Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But theſe fables have been long exploded: we ſhall now return to the notion of its being a poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous animal, and deliver as our opinion, that its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive deformity, joined to the faculty it has of emitting a juice from its pimples, and a duſky li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid from its hind parts, is the foundation of the report.</p>
                     <p>That it has any noxious qualities we have been unable to bring proofs in the ſmalleſt degree ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, tho' we have heard many ſtrange relations on that point.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, we know ſeveral of our friends who have taken them in their naked hands, and held them long without receiving the leſt injury: <note place="margin">Not poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous.</note> It is alſo well known that quacks have eaten them, and have beſides ſqueezed their juices into a glaſs, and drank them with impunity.</p>
                     <p>We may ſay alſo, that theſe reptiles are a common food to many animals; to <hi>buzzards, owls, Norfolk plovers, ducks,</hi> and <hi>ſnakes,</hi> who would not touch them were they in any degree noxious.</p>
                     <p>So far from having venomous qualities, they have of late been conſidered as if they had beneficent ones. We wiſh, for the benefit of mankind, that we could make a favorable report of the many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of late to cure the moſt terrible of diſeaſes the <hi>cancer,</hi> by the application of live toads; but,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1199500103:21"/>alas, they ſeem only to have rendered a horrible complaint more loathſome.</p>
                     <p>In a word, we may conſider the toad as an animal that has neither good nor harm in it; that being a defenceleſs creature, nature has furniſhed it, inſtead of arms, with a moſt diſguſting deformity, that ſtrikes into almoſt every Being capable of annoying it, a ſtrong repugnancy to meddle with ſo hideous and threatening an appearance.</p>
                     <p>The time of their propagation is very early in the ſpring: <note place="margin">Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> at that ſeaſon the females are ſeen crawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about oppreſſed by the males, who continue on them for ſome hours, and adhere ſo faſt as to tear the very ſkin from the Parts they ſtick to. We are uncertain whether they are viviparous: <hi>Linnoeus</hi>

                     <p>To conclude this account with the marvellous, this animal is ſaid to have often been found in the midſt of ſolid rocks, and even in the centre of growing trees, impriſoned in a ſmall hollow, to which there was not the leaſt adit or entrance <note n="**" place="bottom">Plot'<hi>s</hi> Hiſt.

                     <p>THOSE we have ſeen differ in color, but agree in all other reſpects with the ſpecies deſcribed by Doctor <hi>Plot.</hi> Their length from the noſe to the hind legs was three inches; from thence to the end of the tail three and three quarters.</p>
                     <p>Along the back was a black liſt; each ſide of that a brown one: then ſucceeded a narrow ſtripe, ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alternately yellow and brown; beneath that a broad black one; thoſe ended a little beyond the hind legs. The belly was yellow, and the ſcales large but even. The ſcales on the back ſmall; on the tail the ends projected: thoſe on the latter were varied with black and brown.</p>
                     <p>The legs and feet were duſky; on each foot were five toes, furniſhed with claws.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1199500103:25"/>This ſpecies is extremely nimble: in hot weather it baſks on the ſides of dry banks, or of old trees; but on being obſerved immediately retreats to its hole.</p>
                     <p>The food of this ſpecies, as of all the other <hi>Engliſh</hi> lizards, is inſects: they themſelves of birds of prey. Each of our lizards are perfectly harmleſs; yet their form is what ſtrikes one with diſguſt, and has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned great obſcurity in their hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>Related to this ſpecies is the <hi>Guernſey</hi> lizard, <note place="margin">Other ſpecies.</note> which we are informed has been propagated in <hi>England</hi> from ſome originally brought from that iſland. We have alſo heard of a green lizard frequent near <hi>Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam,</hi> which probably may be of that kind: but the moſt uncommon ſpecies we ever met with any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, is that which was killed near <hi>Woſcot,</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>Swinford, Worceſterſhire,</hi> in 1741, which was two feet ſix inches long, and four inches in girth. The fore legs were placed eight inches from the head; the hind legs five inches beyond thoſe: the legs two inches long: the feet divided into four toes, each furniſhed with a ſharp claw.

                     <p>Providence is extremely kind in making this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies far from being prolific, we having never heard of more than eleven eggs being found in one viper, and thoſe are as if chained together, and each about the ſize of a blackbird's egg.</p>
                     <p>The viper grows ſeldom to a greater length than two feet; tho' once we ſaw a female (which is nearly a third larger than the male) which was almoſt three feet long.</p>

                     <p>Theſe iſlands may be particularly thankful for the bleſſing they enjoy, in being poſſeſſed of only one venomous animal, and that of a kind which encreaſes ſo little.</p>
                     <p>They copulate in <hi>May,</hi> and are ſuppoſed to be about three months before they bring forth.</p>

                     <p>We have been often aſſured by intelligent people of the truth of a fact mentioned by Sir <hi>Thomas Brown,</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Vulgar errors, <hi>114.</hi>
                        </note> who was far from a credulous writer, that the young of the viper, when terrified, will run down the throat of the parent, and ſeek ſhelter in its belly in the ſame manner as the young of the <hi>oppoſſum</hi> retire into the ventral pouch of the old one.</p>
                     <p>From this ſome have imagined that the viper is ſo unnatural as to devour its own young; we diſbelieve the fact, <note place="margin">Food.</note> it being well known the food of theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents is frogs, toads, lizards, mice, and, according to Doctor <hi>Mead,</hi> even an animal ſo large as a mole.

                     <p>The viper is capable of ſupporting very long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, it being known that ſome have been kept in a box ſix months without food, yet did not abate of their vivacity. They feed only a ſmall part of the year, but never during their confinement; for if mice, their favorite diet, ſhould at that time be thrown into their box, tho' they will kill, yet they never will eat them.</p>
                     <p>The poiſon decreaſes in violence in proportion to the length of their confinement: it muſt be alſo added the virtues of its fleſh (whatſoever they be) are at the ſame time conſiderably leſſened.</p>
                     <p>Theſe animals, when at liberty, remain torpid throughout the winter; yet when confined have never been obſerved to take their annual repoſe.</p>
                     <p>The method of catching them is by putting a clift ſtick on or near their head; after which they are ſeized by the tail, and put inſtantly into a bag.</p>
                     <p>The viper-catchers are very frequently bit by them in the purſuit of their buſineſs, yet we very rarely
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1199500103:32"/>hear of the bite being fatal. The remedy, if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in time, is very certain, and is nothing elſe but ſallad oil, which the viper-catchers ſeldom go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. The <hi>axungia viperina,</hi> or the fat of vipers, is alſo another. Doctor <hi>Mead</hi> ſuſpects the efficacy of this laſt, and ſubſtitutes one of his own in its place <note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay on Poiſons, <hi>47.</hi>
                        </note>; but we had rather truſt to vulgar receipts which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual trials have ſhewn to be infallible.</p>
                     <p>The ſymptoms of the venom, <note place="margin">Effects of its bite.</note> if the wound is neglected, are very terrible: it firſt cauſes an acute pain in the place affected, attended with a ſwelling, firſt red, afterwards livid, which by degrees ſpreads to the neighbouring parts; great faintneſs, and a quick tho' low and interrupted pulſe enſue; great ſickneſs at the ſtomach, bilious convulſive vomitings, cold ſweats, and ſometimes pains about the navel; and in conſequence of theſe death itſelf <note n="**" place="bottom">Lib. <hi>xxix.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note>. But the violence of the ſymptoms depends much on the ſeaſon of the year, the difference of the climate, the ſize or rage of the animal, or the depth or ſituation of the wound.</p>
                     <p>Dreadful as the effects of its bite may be, yet its fleſh has been long celebrated as a noble medicine. Doctor <hi>Mead</hi> cites from <hi>Pliny, Galen,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Uſes.</note> and other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, ſeveral proofs of its efficacy in the cure of <hi>ulcers,</hi> the <hi>elephantiaſis,</hi> and other bad complaints. He even ſays he has ſeen good effects from it in an obſtinate <hi>lepra:</hi> it is at preſent uſed as a reſtorative, tho' we think the modern phyſicians have no great dependence on its virtues. The antients preſcribed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1199500103:33"/>it boiled, and to be eaten as fiſh; for when freſh, the medicine was much more likely to take effect than when dried, and given in form of a powder or troche.</p>
                     <p>The antient <hi>Britons</hi> had a ſtrange ſuperſtition in reſpect to theſe animals, and of which there ſtill remains in <hi>Wales</hi> a ſtrong tradition.

                     <p>On each ſide the neck is a ſpot of pale yellow, and the baſe of each is a triangular black ſpot, one angle of which points towards the tail.</p>

                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:1199500103:36"/>The teeth are ſmall and ſerrated, lying each ſide the jaw in two rows.</p>
                     <p>This ſpecies is perfectly inoffenſive; it frequents and lodges itſelf among buſhes in moiſt places, and will readily take the water, ſwimming very well.</p>
                     <p>It preys on frogs, inſects, worms, and mice, and, conſidering the ſmallneſs of the neck, it is amazing how large an animal it will ſwallow.</p>
                     <p>The ſnake is oviparous: <note place="margin">Eggs.</note> it lays its eggs in dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, and in hot-beds, whoſe heat, aided by that of the ſun, promotes the excluſion of the young.</p>
                     <p>During winter it lies torpid in banks of hedges, and under old trees.</p>

                  <p>NATURE on this tribe hath beſtowed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſtructure in all reſpects agreeing with that of quadrupeds; and in a few other the external parts in both are ſimilar.</p>
                  <p>Cetaceous Fiſh, like land animals, breathe by means of lungs, being deſtitute of gills. This obliges them to riſe frequently to the ſurface of the water to reſpire, to ſleep on the ſurface, as well as to perform ſeveral other functions.</p>
                  <p>They have the power of uttering ſounds, ſuch as bellowing and making other noiſes, a faculty denied to genuine fiſh <note n="*" place="bottom">Pontop. Hiſt. Norw. <hi>ii. 123.</hi> Blaſius Anat. Animal, <hi>288.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Like land animals they have warm blood, are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with organs of generation, copulate, bring forth, and ſuckle their young, ſhewing a ſtrong at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to them.</p>
                  <p>Their bodies beneath the ſkin are entirely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a thick layer of fat (blubber) analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to the lard on hogs.</p>
                  <p>The number of their fins never exceeds three, <hi>viz.</hi> two pectoral fins, and one back fin; but in ſome ſpecies the laſt is wanting.</p>
                  <p>Their tails are placed horizontally or flat in reſpect to their bodies; contrary to the direction of thoſe of all other fiſh, which have them in a perpendicular ſite. This ſituation of the tail enables them to force themſelves ſuddenly to the ſurface of the water
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1199500103:48"/>to breathe, which they are ſo frequently conſtrained to do.</p>
                  <p>Many of theſe circumſtances induced <hi>Linnoeus</hi> to place this tribe among his <hi>Mammalia,</hi> or what other writers ſtyle quadrupeds.</p>
                  <p>To have preſerved the chain of beings entire, he ſhould in this caſe have made the genus of <hi>Phocoe,</hi> or <hi>Seals,</hi> and that of the <hi>Trichecus</hi> or <hi>Manati,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately precede the whale, thoſe being the links that connect the <hi>Mammalia</hi> or quadrupeds with the fiſh; for the <hi>Seal</hi> is, in reſpect to its legs, the moſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the former claſs; and in the <hi>Manati</hi> the hind feet coaleſce, aſſuming the form of a broad horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal tail.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the many parts and properties which cetaceous fiſh have in common with land ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, yet there ſtill remain others, that in a natural arrangement of the animal kingdom, muſt determine us after the example of the illuſtrious <hi>Ray</hi>

This method of building was formerly practiſed by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Greenland,</hi> as we find from <hi>Frobiſher,</hi> in his ſecond voyage, p. 18, publiſhed in 1578.</note>

                        <p>The head is very much diſproportioned to the ſize of the body, being one-third the ſize of the fiſh: the under lip is much broader than the upper. The tongue is compoſed of a ſoft ſpongy fat, capable of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1199500103:50"/>yielding five or ſix barrels of oil. The gullet is very ſmall for ſo vaſt a fiſh, not exceeding four inches in width. In the middle of the head are two orifices, thro' which it ſpouts water to a vaſt height, and with a great noiſe, eſpecially when diſturbed or wounded.</p>
                        <p>The eyes are no larger than thoſe of an ox.</p>
                        <p>On the back there is no fin, but on the ſides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath each eye, are two large ones.</p>
                        <p>The penis is eight feet in length, incloſed in a ſtrong ſheath. The teats in the female are placed in the lower part of the belly.</p>
                        <p>The tail is broad and ſemilunar.</p>
                        <p>This whale varies in color: the back of ſome being red, the belly generally white. Others are black, ſome mottled, others quite white, according to the obſervations of <hi>Marten,</hi> who ſays, that their colors in the water are extremely beautiful, and that their ſkin is very ſmooth and ſlippery.</p>
                        <p>What is called <hi>whalebone</hi> adheres to the upper jaw, <note place="margin">Whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.</note> and is formed of thin parallel laminae, ſome of the longeſt four yards in length; of theſe there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly 350 on each ſide, but in very old fiſh more; of theſe about 500 are of a length fit for uſe, the others being too ſhort. They are ſurrounded with long ſtrong hair, not only that they may not hurt the tongue, but as ſtrainers to prevent the return of their food when they diſcharge the water out of their mouths.</p>

                        <p>THIS ſpecies is diſtinguiſhed from the common whale by a fin on the back, placed very low and near the tail.</p>
                        <p>The length is equal to that of the common kind, <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> but much more ſlender. It is furniſhed with whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone in the upper jaw, mixed with hairs, but ſhort and knotty, and of little value. The blubber alſo on the body of this kind is very inconſiderable: theſe circumſtances, added to its extreme fierceneſs and agility, which renders the capture very dangerous, cauſe the fiſhers to neglect it. The natives of <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> tho' hold it in great eſteem, as it affords a quantity of fleſh, which to their palate is very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                        <p>The lips are brown, and like a twiſted rope: the ſpout hole is as it were ſplit in the top of its head, thro' which it blows water with much more violence, and to a greater height, than the common whale.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1199500103:56"/>The fiſhers are not fond of ſeeing it, for on its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance the others retire out of thoſe ſeas.</p>

We are at a loſs to account for the origin of thoſe fables, ſince it does not appear that the dolphin ſhews a greater attachment to mankind than the reſt of the cetaceous tribe. We know that at preſent the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of this fiſh, and the porpeſſe, are far from being eſteemed favorable omens by the ſeamen; for their boundings, ſprings and frolics in the water, are held to be ſure ſigns of an approaching gale.</p>
                        <p>It is from their leaps out of that element that they aſſume a temporary form that is not natural to them, but which the old painters and ſculptors have almoſt always given them. A dolphin is ſcarce ever exhibited by the antients in a ſtrait ſhape, but almoſt always incurvated: ſuch are thoſe on the coin of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> which is preſerved by <hi>Belon,</hi> as well as on ſeveral other pieces of antiquity. The poets deſcribe them much in the ſame manner, and it is not improbable but that the one had borrowed from the other:

                        <p>Theſe ſometimes appear on our coaſts, but are found in much greater numbers off the <hi>North Cape</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> whence they are called <hi>North Capers.</hi> Theſe and all other whales are obſerved to ſwim againſt the wind, and to be much diſturbed, and tumble about with unuſual violence at the approach of a ſtorm.</p>

                        <p>It will be but juſtice to ſay, that no one of our countrymen ever did ſo much towards form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a general natural hiſtory of this kingdom as Sir <hi>Robert Sibbald:</hi> he ſketched out a fine out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line of the Zoology of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the greateſt part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> animals, and, we are told, had actually filled up a conſiderable part of it: he publiſhed a particular hiſtory of the county of <hi>Fife,</hi> and has left us a moſt excellent hiſtory of the whales which frequent the coaſt of <hi>Scotland.</hi> We acknowledge ourſelves much indebted to him for information in reſpect to many of thoſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1199500103:72"/>fiſh, few of which frequent the ſouthern ſeas of thoſe kingdoms, and thoſe that are accidentally caſt aſhore on our coaſts, are generally cut up by the country people, before an opportunity can be had of examining them.</p>

                  <p>THIS title is given to all fiſh whoſe muſcles are ſupported by cartilages inſtead of bones, and comprehends the ſame genera of fiſh to which <hi>Linnaeus</hi> has given the name of <hi>amphibia nantes:</hi> but the word <hi>amphibia,</hi> ought properly to be confined to ſuch animals who inhabit both elements, and can live without any inconvenience for a conſiderable ſpace, either on land or under water. This defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore excludes all that form this diviſion.</p>
                  <p>Many of the cartilaginous fiſh are viviparous, being excluded from an egg, which is hatched within them. The egg conſiſts of a white and a yolk, and is lodged in a caſe, formed of a thick tough ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not unlike ſoftened horn: ſuch are the eggs of the Ray and Shark kinds.</p>
                  <p>Some again differ in this reſpect, and are ovipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; ſuch is the Sturgeon, and others.</p>
                  <p>They breathe either thro' certain apertures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, as in the Rays; on their ſides as in the Sharks, &amp;c. or on the top of the head, as in the Pipe-fiſh; for they have not covers to their gills like the bony fiſh.</p>

                        <p>LAMPREYS are found at certain ſeaſons of the year in ſeveral of our rivers, <note place="margin">Place.</note> but the <hi>Severn</hi> is the moſt noted for them <note n="*" place="bottom">They are alſo found in the moſt conſiderable of the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> rivers.</note> They are ſea fiſh, but like ſalmon, quit the ſalt waters, and aſcend the latter end of the winter, or beginning of ſpring, and after a ſtay of a few months return again to the ocean, a very few excepted. The beſt ſeaſon for them is the months of <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> for they are more firm when juſt arrived out of the ſalt water than they are afterwards, being obſerved to be much waſted, and very flabby at the approach of hot weather.</p>
                        <p>They are taken in the nets along with ſalmon and ſhad, and ſometimes in weels laid in the bottom of the river.</p>

                           <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1199500103:75"/>It has been an old cuſtom for the city of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> annually, to preſent his majeſty with a <hi>lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prey</hi> pye, covered with a large raiſed cruſt. As the gift is made at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> it is with great difficulty the corporation can procure any freſh lampreys at that time, tho' they give guinea a-piece for them, ſo early in the ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>They are reckoned a great delicacy, either when potted or ſtewed, but are a ſurfeiting food, as one of our monarchs fatally experienced, <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt's death being occaſioned by a too plentiful meal of theſe fiſh.</p>
                        <p>Lampreys are ſometimes found ſo large as to weigh four or five pounds.</p>
                        <p>The mouth is round and placed rather obliquely below the end of the noſe: the edges are jagged, which enables them to adhere the more ſtrongly to the ſtones, as their cuſtom is, and which they do ſo firmly as not to be drawn off without ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                        <p>We have heard of one weighing three pounds, which was taken out of the <hi>Eſk,</hi> adhering to a ſtone of twelve pounds weight, ſuſpended at its mouth, from which it was forced with no ſmall pains.</p>
                        <p>There are in the mouth twenty rows of ſmall teeth, diſpoſed in circular orders, and placed far within.</p>
                        <p>The color is duſky, irregularly marked with dirty yellow, which gives the fiſh a diſagreeable look.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the antients were unacquainted with this fiſh; <note place="margin">Not the Muraena</note> ſo far is certain, that which Doctor <hi>Arbuthnot,</hi> and other learned men, render the word <hi>lamprey,</hi> is a ſpecies unknown in our ſeas, being the

                        <p>THIS ſpecies derives its <hi>Latin</hi> name from the inſtruments fullers make uſe of in ſmoothing cloth, the back being rough, with ſmall ſpines like that.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſpines are ſpread not only over the back, but the upper ſide of the fins and the head: near each eye is a ſemicircular order of larger ſpines, and about the noſe are a few others; a row of the ſame kind go half way down the back: the tail is armed with a double row of ſtill greater ſpines.</p>
                        <p>The color of the upper part is aſh-color, mixed with yellow; the lower part of the body entirely white.</p>

                        <p>The enchantreſs <hi>Circe,</hi> armed her ſon with a ſpear headed with the ſpine of the <hi>Trygon,</hi> as the moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible weapon ſhe could furniſh him with, and with which he afterwards committed parricide, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally, on his father <hi>Ulyſſes.</hi>

                        <p>That ſpears and darts might, in very early times, have been headed with this bone inſtead of iron, we have no kind of doubt: that of another ſpecies of this fiſh being ſtill uſed to point the arrows of ſome of the <hi>South American Indians,</hi> and is, from its hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſharpneſs, and beards, a moſt dreadful weapon.</p>

It is in fact the weapon of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence belonging to the fiſh, capable of giving a very bad wound, and which is attended with dangerous ſymptoms, when it falls on a tendinous part, or on a perſon in a bad habit of body.

                        <p>THIS is the fiſh which connects the genus of rays and ſharks, partaking ſomething of the character of both; yet in an exception to each in the ſituation of the mouth, which is placed at the extremity of the head.</p>
                        <p>It is a fiſh not unfrequent on moſt of our coaſts, where it prowls about for prey like others of the kind. It is extremely voracious, and, like the ray,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1199500103:91"/>feeds on flounders and flat fiſh, which keep at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the water, as we have often found on open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. <note place="margin">Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> It is extremely fierce and dangerous to be approached. We knew an inſtance of a fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe leg was terribly tore by a large one of this ſpecies, which lay within his nets in ſhallow wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and which he went to lay hold of incautiouſly.</p>
                        <p>The aſpect of theſe, as well as the reſt of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, have much malignity in them: their eyes are oblong, and placed lengthways in their head, funk in it, and overhung by the ſkin, and ſeem fuller of malevolence than fire.</p>
                        <p>Their ſkin is very rough; the antients made uſe of it to poliſh wood and ivory <note n="*" place="bottom">Qua lignum et ebora poliuntur. <hi>Plinii lib.</hi> ix. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note>, as we do at preſent that of the greater dog-fiſh. The fleſh is now but little eſteemed on account of its coarſeneſs and rankneſs, yet <hi>Archeſtratus</hi> (as quoted by <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> p. 319) ſpeaking of the fiſh of <hi>Miletus,</hi> gives this the firſt place in reſpect to its delicacy of the whole cartilaginous tribe.</p>
                        <p>They grow to a great ſize; <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> we have ſeen them of near an hundred weight.</p>
                        <p>The head is large, the teeth broad at their baſe, but ſlender and very ſharp above, and diſpoſed in five rows all round the jaws. Like thoſe of all ſharks, they are capable of being raiſed or depreſſed by means of muſcles uniting them to the jaws, not being lodged in ſockets as the teeth of cetaceous fiſh are.</p>

                        <p>The back is of a pale aſh-color, and very rough; along the middle is a prickly tuberculated line: the belly is white and ſmooth.</p>
                        <p>The pectoral fins are very large, and extend hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontally from the body to a great diſtance; they have ſome reſemblance to wings, ſo writers have given this the name it bears in this work.</p>
                        <p>The ventral fins are placed in the ſame manner, and the double penis is placed in them, which forms another character of the males in this and the laſt genus.</p>
                        <p>The tail is bifurcated, the upper lobe rather the longeſt: not very remote from the end on the back are two fins.</p>

On the lower part were four others, viz. two pectoral fins, and two ventral fins; the laſt placed juſt beneath the hind fin of the back. Near theſe the male had two genitals, and between theſe fins was ſituated the pudendum of the female.</p>
                        <p>The tail was very large, and the upper part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably longer than the lower.</p>
                        <p>The color of the upper part of the body was a deep leaden; the belly white.</p>
                        <p>The ſkin was rough, like ſhagreen, but leſs ſo on the belly than the back.</p>
                        <p>Within ſide the mouth, towards the throat, was a very ſhort ſort of whalebone.</p>
                        <p>The liver was of a great ſize, <note place="margin">Liver.</note> but that of the female was the largeſt; ſome weighed above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, <note place="margin">Oil.</note> and yielded a great quantity of pure and ſweet oil, fit for lamps, and alſo much uſed by the people who took them, to cure bruiſes, burns, and rheumatic complaints. A large fiſh has afforded to the captors a profit of twenty pounds. They were viviparous, a young one about a foot in length being found in the belly of a fiſh of this kind.</p>
                        <p>They were taken with harpoons with long lines fixed to them in much the ſame manner as whales are, and when ſtruck go off with vaſt rapidity, and dart inſtantly to the bottom, taking with them forty or fifty fathom of line, and are a long time before they are quite ſubdued.</p>

                           <pb n="81" facs="tcp:1199500103:97"/>The fiſhers obſerved on them a ſort of leech of a reddiſh color, and about two feet long, but which fell off when the fiſh was brought to the ſurface of the water, and left a white mark on the ſkin.</p>
                        <p>The ſame perſons aſſert, that there were two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this fiſh; a leſſer ſort, about two yards in length, which had in the mouth only three rows of teeth, and thoſe larger than in the kind we have deſcribed, being an inch and an half long.</p>

A maſter of a <hi>Guinea</hi> ſhip informed me, that a rage of ſuicide prevailed among his new bought ſlaves, from a notion the unhappy creatures had, that after death they ſhould be reſtored again to their families, friends, and country. To convince them at leſt that they ſhould not re-animate their bodies, he ordered one of their corpſes to be tied by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1199500103:99"/>the heels to a rope, and lowered into the ſea, and tho' it was drawn up again as faſt as the united force of the crew could be exerted, yet in that ſhort ſpace the ſharks had devoured every part but the feet, which were ſecured at the end of the cord.</p>

                           <hi>AELIAN</hi> relates ſtrange things of the affection this ſpecies bears to its young: among others, he ſays, that it will permit the ſmall brood, when in danger, to ſwim down its mouth, and take ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1199500103:101"/>in its belly. This fact has been ſince confirmed by the obſervation of one of our beſt icthyologiſts <note n="*" place="bottom">Rondeletius, <hi>388.</hi>
                           </note>, and is no more incredible, than that the young of the <hi>Opoſſum</hi> ſhould ſeek an aſylum in the ventral pouch of its parent, a fact too well known to be conteſted. But this degree of care is not peculiar to the blue ſhark, but we believe common to the whole genus.</p>
                        <p>This ſpecies frequents many of our coaſts, but particularly thoſe of <hi>Cornwall</hi> during the pilchard ſeaſon, and is at that time taken with great iron hooks made on purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>It is of an oblong form: <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> the noſe extends far beyond the mouth: it wants the orifices behind the eyes, which are uſual in this genus: the noſtrils are long, and placed tranſverſely. <hi>Artedi</hi> remarks a triangular dent in the lower part of the back.</p>
                        <p>The ſkin is ſmoother than that of other ſharks; the back is of a fine blue color; the belly of a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very white.</p>

                           <hi>Linnoeus</hi> ſays, that its teeth are granulated; for our part we muſt confeſs it is a fiſh that has not come under our examination, therefore hope to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored with an accurate deſcription from ſome Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, who lives on the coaſt it haunts.</p>
                        <p>We may add, that <hi>Rondeletius</hi> ſays he was an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs to its fondneſs for human fleſh; that theſe fiſh are leſs deſtructive in our ſeas, is owing to the coolneſs of the climate, which is well known to abate the fierceneſs of ſome, as well as the venom of other animals.</p>

                        <p>The color of the upper part of the body and fins was a light cinereous; the belly white.</p>
                        <p>The noſe was very long, flat, and ſharp pointed; beyond the noſtrils ſemitranſparent. The noſtrils were placed very near the mouth.</p>
                        <p>Behind each eye was a ſmall orifice. The teeth were numerous, diſpoſed in three rows, ſmall, very ſharp, triangular, and ſerrated on their inner edge.</p>

                        <p>THIS ſpecies being remarkably ſpotted, may be the ſame known to antients by the names expreſſed in the ſynonyms; but they ſo frequently leave ſuch ſlight notices of the animals they mention, that we are often obliged to add a doubtful mark (?) to numbers of them.</p>
                        <p>The weight of one we took was ſix pounds three ounces, <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> and yet it meaſured three feet eight inches in length; ſo light are the cartilaginous fiſh in reſpect to their ſize.</p>
                        <p>The noſe was ſhort, and very blunt, not extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above an inch and an half beyond the mouth. The noſtrils were large, placed near the mouth, and covered with a large angular flap: the head very flat.</p>

                           <pb n="89" facs="tcp:1199500103:106"/>The eyes were oblong, behind each a large ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice opening to the inſide of the mouth.</p>
                        <p>The teeth ſmall, ſharp, ſmooth at their ſides, ſtrait, and diſpoſed in four rows.</p>
                        <p>Both the back fins were placed much behind, and nearer the tail than in common.</p>
                        <p>The tail was finned, and below extended into a ſharp angle.</p>
                        <p>The color of the whole upper part of the body, and the fins, was brown, marked with numbers of large diſtinct black ſpots: ſome parts of the ſkin were tinged with red; the belly was white.</p>

                        <p>The female of this ſpecies, and we believe of other ſharks, is greatly ſuperior in ſize to the male; ſo that in this reſpect there is an agreement between the fiſh and the birds of prey <note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <p>THE weight of one that was brought to us by a fiſherman was only one pound twelve ounces; the length two feet two inches: it is of a ſlender make in all parts.</p>

                        <head>I. The LUMP FISH.</head>
                        <p>THIS ſingular fiſh encreaſes to the weight of four pounds, and the length of ſixteen inches: the ſhape of the body is like that of the bream, deep but very thick, and it ſwims edgeways. The back is ſharp and elevated, the belly flat.</p>
                        <p>The irides are of a cherry color; lips, mouth, <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> and tongue, of a deeper red: the jaws lined with innumerable ſmall teeth; the tongue very thick; along the ridge of the back is a row of large bony tubercles; from above the eye to within a ſmall ſpace of the tail is another row; beneath that a third, commencing at the gills; and on each ſide the belly a fourth row, conſiſting of five tubercles like the other: the whole ſkin is rough, with ſmall tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="104" facs="tcp:1199500103:122"/>On the lower part of the back is a thick knob, improperly called a fin, being deſtitute of ſpines; beneath that is the dorſal fin, of a browniſh hue, reaching within an inch of the tail: on the belly, juſt oppoſite, is another of the ſame form. The belly is of a bright crimſon color: the pectoral fins are large and broad, almoſt uniting at their baſe. Beneath theſe is the part by which it adheres to the rocks, &amp;c. It conſiſts of an oval aperture, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a fleſhy muſcular and obtuſe ſoft ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, edged with ſmall threaded appendages, which concur as ſo many claſpers: tail and vent fins purple.</p>
                        <p>By means of this part it adheres with vaſt force to any thing it pleaſes. As a proof of its tenacity we have known, that on flinging a fiſh of this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies juſt caught, into a pail of water, it fixed itſelf ſo firmly to the bottom, that on taking the fiſh by the tail, the whole pail by that means was lifted, tho' it held ſome gallons, and that without removing the fiſh from its hold.</p>
                        <p>Great numbers of theſe fiſh are found in the <hi>Greenland</hi> ſeas during the months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> when they reſort near the ſhore to ſpawn. Their roc is remarkably large, which the <hi>Greenlanders</hi> boil to a pulp, and eat. They are extremely fat, which recommends them the more to the natives, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire all oily food: they call them <hi>Nipiſets,</hi> or <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh,</hi> and take quantities of them during the ſeaſon <note n="*" place="bottom">Crantz's Hiſt.

                        <p>THE ſea ſnail takes its name from the ſoft and unctuous texture of its body, reſembling that of the land ſnail. It is almoſt tranſparent, and ſoon diſſolves and melts away.</p>
                        <p>It is found in the ſea near the mouths of great rivers.</p>
                        <p>The length is five inches: <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> the color when freſh taken a pale brown: the ſhape of the body round, but near the tail compreſſed ſideways: the belly is white, and very protuberant.</p>
                        <p>The head is large, thick, and round. There are no teeth in the mouth, but the jaws are very rough: the tongue very large.</p>
                        <p>The orifice to the gills is very ſmall.</p>
                        <p>The pectoral fins are very broad, thin, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and almoſt unite under the throat. The firſt ray next the throat is very long, extends far beyond the reſt, and is as fine as a hair.

                        <p>Beneath the throat is a round depreſſion of a whitiſh color, like the impreſſion of a ſeal, ſurrounded by twelve ſmall pale yellow tubera, by which it is probable it adheres to the ſtones like the other ſpecies.</p>

                        <p>The body, in the thickeſt part, was about equal to a ſwan's quil, and angular; but the angles not being very ſharp, they were not eaſily ſeen till the fiſh was dried: the belly was ſlightly carinated, and marked along the middle with a duſky line.</p>
                        <p>The general color of the fiſh was an olive brown: the ſides marked with numbers of bluiſh lines point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the back to the belly, which, in dried fiſh, ſeemed like the ſigns of ſo many joints. Thoſe in a freſh ſubject ceaſed beyond the vent; all beyond that was ſpotted with brown.</p>
                        <p>The dorſal fin was narrow and thin, conſiſting of thirty-eight rays, was two inches long, and placed rather nearer to the head than the tail.</p>
                        <p>The vent was ſeven inches from the tip of the noſe, the body to that orifice was of an equal thickneſs, but from thence tapered to a very ſmall point, having no mark of a fin.</p>

                           <p>THE eel is a very ſingular fiſh in ſeveral things that relate to its natural hiſtory, and in ſome reſpects borders on the nature of the reptile tribe.</p>
                           <p>It is known to quit its element, and during night to wander along the meadows, not only for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1199500103:131"/>change of habitation, but alſo that the ſake of prey, feeding on the ſnails it finds in its paſſage.</p>
                           <p>During winter it beds itſelf deep in the mud, and continues in a ſtate of reſt like the ſerpent kind. It is very impatient of cold, and will eagerly take ſhelter in a whiſp of ſtraw flung into a pond in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere weather, which has ſometimes been practiſed as a method of taking them. <hi>Albertus</hi> 
                              <note n="*" place="bottom">Geſner piſc. <hi>45.</hi>
                              </note> goes ſo far as to ſay, that he has known eels to take ſhelter in a hay-rick, yet all periſhed thro' exceſs of cold.</p>
                           <p>It has been obſerved, that in the river <hi>Nyne</hi> 
                              <note n="**" place="bottom">
                                 <hi>Morton</hi>'s <hi>Hiſt. Northampt.</hi> 419. <hi>Pliny</hi> obſerves, that the eels of the lake <hi>Benacus</hi> collect together in the ſame manner in the month of <hi>October,</hi> poſſibly to retreat from the winter's cold. <hi>lib.</hi> ix. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> there is a variety of ſmall eel, with a leſſer head and narrower mouth than the mommon kind, that is found in clus;ters in the bottom of the river, and is called the <hi>Bed-eel:</hi> theſe are ſometimes rouzed up by violent floods, and are never found at that time with meat in their ſtomachs. This bears ſuch an analogy with the cluſtering of blindworms in their quieſcent ſtate, that we cannot but conſider it as a further proof of a partial agreement in the nature of the two genera.</p>
                           <p>The antients adopted a moſt wild opinion about the generation of theſe fiſh, <note place="margin">Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> believing them to be either created from the mud, or that the ſcrapings of their bodies which they left on the ſtones, were animated and became young eels. Some moderns gave into theſe opinions, and into others that were equally extravagant. They could not account for
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1199500103:132"/>the appearance of theſe fiſh in ponds that never were ſtocked with them, and that were even ſo remote as to make their being met with in ſuch places a phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon that they could not ſolve. But there is much reaſon to believe, that many waters are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with theſe fiſh by the aquatic fowl of prey, in the ſame manner as vegetation is ſpread by many of the land birds, either by being dropped as they carry them to feed their young, or by paſſing quick thro' their bodies, as is the caſe with herons; and ſuch may be occaſion of the appearance of theſe fiſh in places where they were never ſeen before. As to their immediate generation, <note place="margin">Vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> it has been ſufficiently proved to be effected in the ordinary courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that they are viviparous.</p>
                           <p>They are extremely voracious, and very deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the fry of fiſh.</p>
                           <p>No fiſh lives ſo long out of water as the eel: it is extremely tenacious of life, as its parts will move a conſiderable time after they are flayed and cut into pieces.</p>
                           <p>The eel is placed by <hi>Linnaeus</hi> in the genus of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raena,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> his firſt of the apodal fiſh, or ſuch which want the ventral fins.</p>
                           <p>The eyes are placed not remote from the end of the noſe: the irides are tinged with red: the under jaw is longer than the upper: the teeth are ſmall, ſharp, and numerous: beneath each eye is a minute orifice: at the end of the noſe two others, ſmall and tubular.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="114" facs="tcp:1199500103:133"/>This fiſh is furniſhed with a pair of pectoral fins, rounded at their ends. Another narrow fin on the back, uniting with that of the tail; and the anal fin joins it in the ſame manner beneath.</p>
                           <p>Behind the pectoral fins is the orifice to the gills, which are concealed in the ſkin.</p>
                           <p>Eels vary much in their colors, <note place="margin">Silver Eels.</note> from a ſooty hue to a light olive green; and thoſe which are called ſilver eels, have their bellies white, and a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble clearneſs throughout.</p>
                           <p>Beſides theſe there is another variety of this fiſh known in the <hi>Thames</hi> by the name of <hi>Grigs,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Grigs.</note> and about <hi>Oxford</hi> by that of <hi>Grigs</hi> or <hi>Gluts.</hi> Theſe are ſcarce ever ſeen near <hi>Oxford</hi> in the winter, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſpring, and bite readily at the hook, which common eels in that neighborhood will not. They have a larger head, a blunter noſe, thicker ſkin, and Jeſs fat than the common ſort; neither are they ſo much eſteemed, nor do they often exceed three or four pounds in weight.</p>
                           <p>Common eels grow to a large ſize, ſometimes ſo great as to weigh fifteen or twenty pounds, but that is extremely rare. As to inſtances brought by <hi>Dale</hi> and others, of theſe fiſh encreaſing to a ſuperior magnitude, we have much reaſon to ſuſpect them to have been congers, ſince the enormous fiſh they deſcribe, have all been taken at the mouths of the <hi>Thames</hi> or <hi>Medway.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The eel is the moſt univerſal of fiſh, yet is ſcarce ever found in the <hi>Danube,</hi> tho' it is very common in the lakes and rivers of <hi>Upper Auſtria.</hi>

It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that a conger of a hundred weight will waſte by drying to twenty-four pounds; the people therefore prefer the ſmalleſt, poſſibly becauſe they are ſooneſt cured.

                           <p>It is a moſt ravenous and fierce fiſh, and when taken faſtens on any thing within its reach: the fiſhermen dreading its bite, endeavor as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1199500103:140"/>to beat out its fore teeth, and then kill it by ſtriking it behind the head. <hi>Schonevelde</hi> relates, that its bite is ſo hard that it will ſeize on an anchor, and leave the marks of its teeth in it; and the <hi>Daniſh</hi> and <hi>German</hi> names of <hi>Steenbider</hi> and <hi>Steinbeiſſer,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſenſe of its great ſtrength, as if it was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of cruſhing even ſtones with its jaws.</p>

It does not appear they are diſſolved in the ſtomach, but are voided with the foeces, for which purpoſe the aperture of the anus is wider than in other fiſh of the ſame ſize.</p>
                           <p>It is full of roe in <hi>February, March,</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> and ſpawns in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This fiſh has ſo diſagreeable and horrid an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that nobody at <hi>Scarborough</hi> except the fiſhermen will eat it, and they prefer it to holibut. They always before dreſſing take off the head and ſkin.</p>
                           <p>The ſea wolf grows to a large ſize: <note place="margin">Size.</note> thoſe on the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> coaſt are ſometimes found of the length of four feet, and, according to Doctor <hi>Gronovius,</hi> have been taken near <hi>Hitland</hi> ſeven feet long, and even more. That which we examined was three feet two inches and an half from the tip of the noſe to the end of the tail: the length of the head was eight inches, from the gills to the vent, ten; from thence to the tip of the tail, twenty and one half.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="121" facs="tcp:1199500103:141"/>The circumference of the head was ſeventeen inches, at the ſhoulders twenty, but near the tail only four and a half.</p>
                           <p>Its weight was twenty pounds and a quarter.</p>
                           <p>The head is a little ſlatted on the top: the noſe blunt; the noſtrils very ſmall; the eyes ſmall, and placed near the end of the noſe.</p>
                           <p>The teeth are very remarkable, <note place="margin">Teeth.</note> and finely adapted to its way of life. The fore teeth are ſtrong, coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, diverging a little from each other, ſtand far out of the jaws, and are commonly ſix above, and the ſame below, tho' ſometimes there are only five in each jaw: theſe are ſupported within-ſide by a row of leſſer teeth, which makes the number in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per jaw ſeventeen or eighteen, in the lower eleven or twelve.</p>
                           <p>The ſides of the under jaw are convex inwards, which greatly adds to their ſtrength, and at the ſame time allows room for the large muſcles with which the head of this fiſh is furniſhed.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>dentes molares,</hi> or grinding teeth of the under jaw, are higher on the outer than the inner edges, which inclines their ſurfaces inward: they join to the canine teeth in that jaw, but in the upper are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from them.</p>
                           <p>In the centre are two rows of flat ſtrong teeth, fixed on an oblong baſis upon the bones of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and noſe.</p>
                           <p>Theſe and the other grinding teeth are often found foſſil, and in that ſtate called <hi>Bufonites,</hi> or <hi>Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones:</hi> they were formerly much eſteemed for their
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1199500103:142"/>imaginary virtues, and were ſet in gold, and worn as rings.</p>
                           <p>The two bones that form the under jaw are united before by a looſe cartilage, which mechaniſm admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a motion from ſide to ſide, moſt evidently contributes to the deſign of the whole, <hi>viz.</hi> a faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of breaking, grinding, and comminuting its teſtaceous and cruſtaceous food.</p>
                           <p>The body is long, and a little compreſſed ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; the ſkin ſmooth and ſlippery: it wants the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral line.</p>
                           <p>The pectoral fins conſiſt of eighteen rays, are five inches long, and ſeven and a quarter broad.</p>
                           <p>The dorſal fin extends from the hind part of the head almoſt to the tail; the rays in the freſh fiſh are not viſible.</p>
                           <p>The anal fin extends as far as the dorſal fin.</p>
                           <p>The tail is round at its end, and conſiſts of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen rays.</p>
                           <p>The ſides, <note place="margin">Color.</note> back, and fins, are of a livid lead co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; the two firſt marked downwards wiith irregular obſcure duſky lines; theſe in different fiſh have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent appearances.</p>
                           <p>We think ourſelves much indebted to Mr. <hi>Travis,</hi> Surgeon, at <hi>Scarborough,</hi> for his ingenious remarks on this fiſh, as well as on ſeveral others that frequent that coaſt, being a gentleman much ſkilled in icthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, and extremely liberal in communicating his knowlege.</p>

                           <p>THE qualities of this fiſh were well known to the antients, who take notice of them without any exaggeration: the wounds inflicted by its ſpines are exceedingly painful, attended with a violent burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and moſt pungent ſhooting, and ſometimes with an inflammation that will extend from the arm to the ſhoulder <note n="*" place="bottom">It is probable that the malignity of the ſymptoms ariſes from the habit of body the perſon is in, or the part in which the wound is given.</note>

                           <p>THIS fiſh is found only in the northern part of the world; it is, as <hi>Rondeletius</hi> calls it, an ocean fiſh, and never met with in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> ſea. <note n="*" place="bottom">None (ſays Captain <hi>Armſtrong</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Minorca</hi>) of the <hi>Aſelli</hi> or cod fiſh kind, frequent our ſhores, <hi>p.</hi> 163.</note>. It affects cold climates, and ſeems confined
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1199500103:160"/>between the latitudes 66 and 50: what are caught north and ſouth of thoſe degrees being either few in quantity, or bad in quality. The <hi>Greenland</hi> fiſh are ſmall and emaciated thro' want of food, being very voracious, and having in thoſe ſeas a dearth of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion.</p>
                           <p>This locality of ſituation is common to many other ſpecies of this genus, moſt of them being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the cold ſeas, or ſuch that lie within zones that can juſt clame the title of temperate.

                           <p>The great rendezvouz of the cod fiſh is on the Banks of <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> and the other ſand banks that lie off the coaſts of <hi>Cape Breton, Nova Scotia,</hi> and <hi>New England.</hi> They prefer thoſe ſituations, by reaſon of the quantity of worms produced in thoſe ſandy bottoms, which tempt them to reſort there for food: but another cauſe of the particular attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the fiſh have to theſe ſpots, is their vicinity to the polar ſeas, where they return to ſpawn; there they depoſe their roes in full ſecurity, but want of food forces them, as ſoon as the firſt more ſouthern ſeas are open, to repair thither for ſubſiſtence.</p>
                           <p>Few are taken north of <hi>Iceland,</hi> but on the ſouth and weſt coaſts they abound: they are again found to ſwarm on the coaſts of <hi>Norway,</hi> in the <hi>Baltic,</hi> off the <hi>Orkney</hi> and the <hi>Weſtern Iſles;</hi> after which their

                           <p>Before the diſcovery of <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> the greater fiſheries of cod were in the ſeas of <hi>Iceland,</hi> and of our <hi>Weſtern Iſles,</hi> which were the grand reſort of ſhips of all the commercial nations; but it ſeems that the greateſt plenty was met with near <hi>Iceland;</hi> for we find Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> condeſcending to aſk permiſſion to fiſh in thoſe ſeas from <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the IVth. of <hi>Denmark,</hi> yet afterwards ſhe ſo far repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her requeſt, as to inſtruct her embaſſadors to that court, to inſiſt on the right of a free and univerſal fiſhery <note n="*" place="bottom">

                           <p>But Mr. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> in his Dictionary of Commerce, I. 363, ſays, that the <hi>French</hi> began to fiſh there ſo
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1199500103:162"/>early as 1536; and we think we have ſomewhere read, that their firſt pretence for fiſhing for cod in thoſe ſeas, was only to ſupply an <hi>Engliſh</hi> convent with that article.</p>
                           <p>The encreaſe of ſhipping that reſort to thoſe fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile banks, are now unſpeakable: our own country ſtill enjoys the greateſt ſhare, which ought to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed our chiefeſt treaſure, as it brings wealth to individuals, and ſtrength to the ſtate.</p>
                           <p>All this immenſe fiſhery is carried on by the hook and line only <note n="*" place="bottom">We have been informed that they fiſh in the depth of from fifteen to ſixty fathoms, according to the inequality of the <hi>Bank,</hi> which is repreſented as a vaſt mountain under water above five hundred miles long, and near three hundred broad, and that ſeamen knew when they approach it by the great ſwell of the ſea, and the thick miſts that impend over it.</note>; the bait is herring, a ſmall fiſh called a <hi>Capelin,</hi> a ſhell fiſh called <hi>Clams,</hi> and bits of ſea fowl; and with theſe are caught fiſh ſufficient to find employ for near fifteen thouſand <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſeamen, and to afford ſubſiſtence to a much more numerous body of people at home, who are engaged in the various manufactures which ſo vaſt a fiſhery demands.</p>
                           <p>The food of the cod is either ſmall fiſh, <note place="margin">Food.</note> worms, teſtaceous, or cruſtaceous animals, ſuch as crabs, large whelks, &amp;c. and their digeſtion is ſo powerful, as to diſſolve the greateſt part of the ſhells they ſwallow. They are very voracious, and catch at any ſmall body they perceive moved by the water, even ſtones and pebbles, which are often found in their ſtomachs.</p>
                           <p>Providence hath kindly ordained that this fiſh, <note place="margin">Vaſtly prolific.</note> ſo uſeful to mankind, ſhould be ſo very prolific as to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1199500103:163"/>ſupply more than the deficiencies of the multitudes annually taken. <hi>Leuwenhoek</hi> counted nine millions three hundred and eighty-four thouſand eggs in a cod fiſh of a middling ſize, a number ſure that will baffle all the efforts of man, or the voracity of the inhabitants of the ocean to exterminate, and which will ſecure to all ages an inexhauſtible ſupply of grateful proviſion.</p>
                           <p>In our ſeas they begin to ſpawn in <hi>January,</hi> and depoſite their eggs in rough ground, among rocks. Some continue in roe till the beginning of <hi>April.</hi> The cod fiſh in general recover quicker after ſpawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than any other fiſh, therefore it is common to take ſome good ones all the ſummer. When they are out of s;eaſon they are thin tailed and louſy, and the lice chiefly fix themſelves on the inſide of their mouths.</p>
                           <p>The fiſh of a middling ſize are moſt eſteemed for the table, and are choſen by their plumpneſs and roundneſs, eſpecially near the tail, by the depth of the ſulcus or pit behind the head, and by the regular undulated appearance of the ſides, as if they were ribbed. The glutinous parts about the head loſe their delicate flavor after it has been twenty-four hours out of the water, even in winter, in which theſe and other fiſh of this genus are in higheſt ſeaſon.</p>
                           <p>The largeſt that we ever heard of taken on our coaſts weighed ſixty-nine pounds, <note place="margin">Size.</note> but the general weight on the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> ſeas is from fourteen to forty.</p>

                              <pb n="142" facs="tcp:1199500103:164"/>The jaws are of an equal length, at the end of the lower is a ſmall beard; the teeth are diſpoſed in the palate as well as jaws.</p>
                           <p>The eyes are large.</p>
                           <p>On the back are three ſoft fins; the firſt has four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, the two laſt nineteen rays a-piece. The ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral fins are very ſlender, and conſiſt but of ſix rays; the two firſt extending far beyond the others. It has two anal fins; the firſt conſiſting of twenty, the laſt of ſixteen rays.</p>
                           <p>The tail is almoſt even at the end: the firſt ray on each ſide is ſhort, and compoſed of a ſtrong bone.</p>
                           <p>The color of this fiſh is cinereous on the back and ſides, and commonly ſpotted with yellow: the belly is white, but they vary much, not only in color <note n="*" place="bottom">Codlings are often taken of a yellow, orange, and even red color, while they remain among the rocks, but on changing their place aſſume the color of other cod fiſh.</note> but in ſhape, particularly that of the head.</p>

                           <p>THE coal fiſh takes its name from the black color that it ſometimes aſſumes. <hi>Belon</hi> calls it the <hi>Colfiſch,</hi> imagining it was ſo named by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> from its producing the <hi>Icthyocolla,</hi> but <hi>Geſner</hi> gives the true etimology.</p>
                           <p>Theſe fiſh are common on moſt of our rocky and deep coaſts, but particularly thoſe of the north of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The young begin to appear on the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> coaſt the beginning of <hi>July</hi> in vaſt ſhoals, <note place="margin">Young.</note> and are at that time about an inch and an half long. In <hi>Auguſt</hi> they are from three to five inches in length, and are taken in great numbers with the angling rod, and are then eſteemed a very delicate fiſh, but grow ſo coarſe when they are a year old that few people will eat them. Fiſh of that age are from eight to fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen inches long, and begin to have a little black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1199500103:176"/>near the gills, and on the back, and the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs encreaſes as they grow older.</p>
                           <p>The fry is known by different names in different places: they are called at <hi>Scarborough Parrs,</hi> and when a year old, <hi>Billets.</hi> About nine or ten years ago ſuch a glut of <hi>Parrs</hi> viſited that part, that for ſeveral weeks it was impoſſible to dip a pail into the ſea without taking ſome.</p>
                           <p>Tho' this fiſh is ſo little eſteemed when freſh, yet it is ſalted and dried for ſale; a perſon laſt year hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cured above a thouſand at <hi>Scarborough.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The coal fiſh is of more elegant form than the cod fiſh: <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> they generally grow to the length of two feet and an half, and weigh about twenty-eight or thirty pounds at moſt. The head is ſmall; the under jaw a little longer than the upper: the irides ſilvery, marked on one ſide with a black ſpot.</p>
                           <p>It has three dorſal fins, the firſt conſiſts of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, the next of twenty, the laſt of twenty-two rays.</p>
                           <p>The pectoral fins of eighteen; the ventral of ſix: the firſt anal fin of twenty-two, the ſecond of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.</p>
                           <p>The tail is broad and forked.</p>
                           <p>Theſe fiſh vary in color. We have ſeen ſome whoſe back, noſe, dorſal fins and tail were of a deep black: the gill covers ſilver and black: the ventral and anal fins white; the belly of the ſame color.</p>
                           <p>We have ſeen others duſky, others brown, but in all the lateral line was ſtrait and white, and the lower part of the ventral and anal fins white.</p>

                           <p>THIS ſpecies is common on many of our rocky coaſts: during ſummer they are ſeen in great ſhoals frolicking on the ſurface of the water, and flinging themſelves into a thouſand forms. They are at that time ſo wanton as to bite at any thing that appears on the top of the waves, and are often taken with a gooſe's feather fixed to the hook. They are a very ſtrong fiſh, being obſerved to keep their ſtation at the feet of the rocks in the moſt turbulent and rapid ſea.</p>
                           <p>They are a good eating fiſh: they do not grow to a very large ſize; at leſt the biggeſt we have ſeen not exceeding ſix or ſeven pounds: but we have heard of ſome that were taken in the ſea near <hi>Scarborough,</hi> which they frequent during winter, that weighted near twenty-eight pounds.</p>
                           <p>The under jaw is longer than the upper; the head and body riſes pretty high, as far as the firſt dorſal fin.</p>

                           <p>While a ling is in ſeaſon its liver is very white, <note place="margin">Oil.</note> and abounds with a fine flavored oil; but as ſoon as the fiſh goes out of ſeaſon, the liver becomes red as that of a bullock, and affords no oil. The ſame hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to the cod and other fiſh in a certain degree, but not ſo remarkably as in the ling. When the fiſh is in perfection, a very large quantity of oil may be melted out of the liver by a ſlow fire, but if a violent ſudden heat be uſed for that purpoſe, they yield very little. This oil, which nature hoards up in the cellular membranes of fiſhes, returns into their blood, and ſupports them in the engendring ſeaſon, when they purſue the buſineſs of generation with ſo much eagerneſs as to neglect their food.</p>

                           <p>THE ſole is found on all our coaſts, but thoſe on the weſtern ſhores are much ſuperior in ſize to thoſe of the north.

                           <p>TURBOTS grow to a very large ſize; <note place="margin">Size.</note> we have ſeen them of three and twenty pounds weight, but have heard of ſome that weighed thirty. They are taken chiefly off the north coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> and others off the <hi>Dutch</hi> coaſt; but we believe the laſt has, in many inſtances, more credit than it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves for the abundance of its fiſh.</p>
                           <p>The large turbots, and ſeveral other kinds of flat fiſh, <note place="margin">Fiſhery.</note> are taken by the hook and line, for they lye in deep water: the method of taking them in wares, or ſtaked nets, is too precarious to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on for the ſupply of our great markets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is by meer accident that the great fiſh ſtray into them.</p>
                           <p>It is a misfortune to the inhabitants of many of our fiſhing coaſts, eſpecially thoſe of the north part of <hi>North Wales,</hi> that they are unacquainted with the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1199500103:218"/>moſt ſucceſsful means of capture: for their benefit, and perhaps that of other parts of our iſland, we ſhall lay before them the method practiſed by the fiſhermen of <hi>Scarborough,</hi> as it was communicated to us by Mr. <hi>Travis.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>When they go out to fiſh, each perſon is provided with three lines. <note place="margin">Lines.</note> Each man's lines are fairly coiled upon a flat oblong piece of wicker-work; the hooks being baited, and placed very regularly in the centre of the coil. Each line is furniſhed with 14 ſcore of hooks, at the diſtance of ſix feet two inches from each other. The hooks are faſtened to the lines upon ſneads of twiſted horſe-hair, 27 inches in length.</p>
                           <p>When fiſhing there are always three men in each coble, and conſequently nine of theſe lines are faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened together, and uſed as one line, extending in length near three miles, and furniſhed with 2520 hooks. An anchor and a buoy are fixed at the firſt end of the line, and one more of each at the end of each man's lines; in all four anchors, which are commonly perforated ſtones, and four buoys made of leather or cork. The line is always laid acroſs the current. The tides of flood and ebb continue an equal time upon our coaſt, and when undiſturbed by winds run each way about ſix hours. They are ſo rapid that the fiſhermen can only ſhoot and haul their lines at the turn of tide; and therefore the lines always remain upon the ground about ſix hours <note n="*" place="bottom">In this ſpace the <hi>myxine glutinoſa</hi> of <hi>Linnaeus,</hi> will frequently penetrate the fiſh that are on the hooks, and entirely devour them, leaving only the ſkin and bones.</note>. The ſame rapidity of tide prevents their uſing hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1199500103:219"/>and therefore two of the people commonly wrap themſelves in the ſail, and ſleep while the other keeps a ſtrict look-out, for fear of being run down by ſhips, and to obſerve the weather. For ſtorms often riſe ſo ſuddenly, that it is with extreme difti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty they can ſometimes eſcape to the ſhore, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lines behind.</p>
                           <p>The coble is 20 feet 6 inches long, <note place="margin">Coble.</note> and 5 feet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme breadth. It is about one ton burthen, rowed with three pair of oars, and admirably conſtructed for the purpoſe of encountering a mountanous ſea: they hoiſt ſail when the wind ſuits.</p>
                           <p>The five-men boat is 40 feet long and 15 broad, and of 25 tons burthen: it is ſo called, tho' navigated by ſix men and a boy, becauſe one of the men is commonly hired to cook, &amp;c. and does not ſhare in the profits with the other five. All our able fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men go in theſe boats to the herring fiſhery at <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> the latter end of <hi>September,</hi> and return about the middle of <hi>November.</hi> The boats are then laid up until the beginning of <hi>Lent,</hi> at which time they go off in them to the edge of the <hi>Dogger,</hi> and other places, to fiſh for turbot, cod, ling, ſkates, &amp;c. They always take two cobles on board, and when they come upon their ground, anchor the boat, throw out the cobles, and fiſh in the ſame manner as thoſe do who go from the ſhore in a coble, with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference only; that here each man is provided with double the quantity of lines, and inſtead of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the return of tide in the coble, return to the boat and bait their other lines; thus hawling one ſet, and ſhooting another every turn of tide. They
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1199500103:220"/>commonly run into harbour twice a week to deliver their fiſh. The five-men boat is decked at each end, but open in the middle, and has two large lug-ſails.</p>
                           <p>The beſt bait for all kinds of fiſh is freſh herring cut in pieces of a proper ſize; <note place="margin">Bait.</note> and notwithſtanding what has been ſaid to the contrary, they are taken here at any time in the winter, and all the ſpring, whenever the fiſhermen put down their nets for that purpoſe. The five-men boats always take ſome nets for that end. Next to herrings are the leſſer lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preys <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Dutch</hi> alſo uſe theſe fiſh as baits in the turbot fiſhery, and purchaſe annually from the <hi>Thames</hi> fiſhermen as much as amounts to 700<hi>l.</hi> worth, for that purpoſe.</note>, which come all winter by land-carriage from <hi>Tadcaſter.</hi> The next baits in eſteem are ſmall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docks cut in pieces, ſand worms, muſcles, and lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets (called here <hi>Flidders;</hi>) and laſtly, when none of theſe can be had they uſe bullock's liver. The hooks uſed here are much ſmaller than thoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at <hi>Iceland</hi> and <hi>Newfoundland.</hi> Experience has ſhewn that the larger fiſh will take a living ſmall one upon the hook, ſooner than any bait that can be put on; therefore they uſe ſuch as the ſmall fiſh can ſwallow. The hooks are two inches and an half long in the ſhank, and near an inch wide between the ſhank and the point. The line is made of ſmall cording, and is always tanned before it is uſed.</p>
                           <p>Turbots, and all the rays, are extremely delicate in their choice of baits. If a piece of herring or hadock has been twelve hours out of the ſea, and then uſed as bait, they will not touch it.</p>

                           <p>The body diminiſhes very ſmall to the tail, which is forked, and expands twelve inches: the gill fins are broad, about eight inches long, and play hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontally: a little behind their inſertion the back fin takes its original, where it is about ſeven inches high, but ſlopes away very ſuddenly, running down very near the tail, and at its termination becomes a little broader: the belly fins are very ſtrong, and placed near the middle of the body: a narrow fin alſo runs from the anus to the tail.</p>
                           <p>All the fins, and alſo the tail, are of a fine ſcarlet; but the colours and beauty of the reſt of the body, which is ſmooth and covered with almoſt impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ſcales, beggars all deſcription; the upper part being a kind of bright green, variegated with whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh

                           </p>
                           <p>It is a gregarious fiſh, and loves deep holes and gentle ſtreams. It is a moſt voracious fiſh, and eager biter: if the angler meets with a ſhoal of them, he is ſure of taking every one.</p>
                           <p>It is a common notion that the pike will not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack this fiſh, being fearful of the ſpiny fins which the perch erects on the approach of the former. This may be true in reſpect to large fiſh; but it is well known the ſmall ones are the moſt tempting bait that can be laid for the pike.</p>
                           <p>The perch is a fiſh very tenacious of life: we have known them carried near ſixty miles in dry ſtraw, and yet ſurvive the journey.</p>

                           <p>The irides golden: the teeth ſmall, diſpoſed in the jaws and on the roof of the mouth: the edges of the covers of the gills ſerrated: on the lower end of the largeſt is a ſharp ſpine.</p>
                           <p>The firſt dorſal fin conſiſts of fourteen ſtrong ſpiny rays; the ſecond of ſixteen ſoft ones: the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral fins are tranſparent, and conſiſt of fourteen rays; the ventral of ſix; the anal of eleven.</p>
                           <p>The tail is a little forked.</p>

                           <p>THIS fiſh is found in ſeveral of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtreams: it is gregarious, aſſembling in large ſhoals, and keeping in the deepeſt part of the water.</p>
                           <p>It is of a much more ſlender form than the perch, and ſeldom exceeds ſix inches in length.</p>
                           <p>The teeth are very ſmall, and diſpoſed in rows.</p>
                           <p>It has only one dorſal fin extending along the greateſt part of the back: the firſt rays like thoſe of the perch are ſtrong, ſharp, and ſpiny; the others ſoft.</p>
                           <p>The pectoral fins conſiſt of fifteen rays; the ventral of ſix; the anal of eight; the two firſt ſtrong and ſpiny: the tail a little bifurcated.</p>
                           <p>The body is covered with rough compact ſcales.</p>
                           <p>The back and ſides are of a dirty green, the laſt Inclining to yellow, but both ſpotted with black.</p>
                           <p>The dorſal fin is ſpotted with black: the tail marked with tranſverſe bars.</p>

                           <p>THESE are common in many of our rivers, but no where in greater quantities than in the <hi>Fens</hi> of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and ſome of the rivers that creep out of them. At <hi>Spalding</hi> there are, once in ſeven or eight years, amazing ſhoals that appear in the <hi>Welland,</hi> and come up the river in form of a vaſt column. They are ſuppoſed to be the multitudes that have been waſhed out of the fens by the floods of ſeveral years, and collected in ſome deep hole, 'till overcharged with numbers, they are periodically obliged to attempt a change of place. The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is ſo great, that they are uſed to manure the land, and trials have been made to get oil from
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1199500103:244"/>them. A notion may be had of this vaſt ſhoal, by ſaying that a man employed by the farmer to take them, has got for a conſiderable time four ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a day by ſelling them at a halfpenny per buſhel.</p>
                           <p>This ſpecies ſeldom reaches the length of two inches: <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> the eyes are large: the belly prominent: the body near the tail ſquare: the ſides are covered with large bony plates, placed tranſverſely.</p>
                           <p>On the back are three ſharp ſpines, that can be raiſed or depreſſed at pleaſure: the dorſal fin is placed near the tail: the pectoral fins are broad: the ventral fins conſiſt each of one ſpine, or rather plate, of unequal lengths, one being large, the other ſmall; between both is a flat bony plate, reaching almoſt to the vent: beneath the vent is a ſhort ſpine, and then ſucceeds the anal fin.</p>
                           <p>The tail conſiſts of twelve rays, and is even at the end.</p>
                           <p>The color of the back and ſides is an olive green; the belly white; but in ſome the lower jaws and belly are of a bright crimſon.</p>

                           <p>There is a misfortune attending the river <hi>Tweed,</hi> which is worthy a parlementary remedy; for there is no law for preſerving the fiſh in it during the fence months, as there is in the caſe of many other <hi>Britiſh</hi> rivers.

From ſome diſagreement between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they will not unite for the preſervation of the fiſh, ſo that in ſome fiſheries on the north ſide they continue killing ſalmon the whole winter, when the death of one fiſh is the deſtruction of thouſands.</p>
                           <p>The legiſlature began very early to pay attention to this important article: by the 13th <hi>Edward</hi> Iſt. there is an act which prohibits the capture of the ſalmon from the Nativity of our Lady to St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>'s Day, in the waters of the <hi>Humber, Owſe, Trent, Done, Arre, Derwent, Wharfe, Nid, Yore, Swale,</hi> and <hi>Tees;</hi> and other monarchs in after-times, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in like manner for the ſecurity of the fiſh in other rivers.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Scotland</hi> poſſeſſes great numbers of fine fiſheries on both ſides of that kingdom. <note place="margin">Scotland.</note> The ſalmon are cured in the ſame manner as at <hi>Berwick,</hi> and a great quantity is ſent to <hi>London</hi> in the ſpring; but after that time the adventurers begin to barrel and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them to foreign countries: but we believe that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1199500103:274"/>commerce is far leſs lucrative than it was in former times, partly owing to the great encreaſe of the <hi>Newfoundland</hi> fiſhery, and partly to the general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the diſcipline of abſtinence in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> church.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ireland</hi> (particularly the north) abounds with this fiſh: <note place="margin">Ireland.</note> the moſt conſiderable fiſhery is at <hi>Cranna,</hi> on the river <hi>Ban,</hi> about a mile and an half from <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine.</hi> When I made the tour of that hoſpitable kingdom in 1754, it was rented by a neighboring gentleman for 620<hi>l.</hi> a year, who aſſured me that the tenant, his predeceſſor, gave 1600<hi>l.</hi> per ann. and was a much greater gainer by the bargain for the reaſons before-mentioned, and on account of the number of poachers who deſtroy the fiſh in the fence months.</p>
                           <p>The mouth of this river faces the north, and is finely ſituated to receive the fiſh that roam along the coaſt, in ſearch of an inlet into ſome freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as they do all along that end of the kingdom which oppoſes itſelf to the northern ocean. We have ſeen near <hi>Ballicaſtle,</hi> nets placed in the ſea at the foot of the promontories that jut into it, which the ſalmon ſtrike into as they are wandering cloſe to ſhore, and numbers are taken by that method.</p>
                           <p>In the <hi>Ban</hi> they fiſh with nets eighteen ſcore yards long, and are continually drawing night and day the whole ſeaſon, which we think laſts about four months, two ſets of ſixteen men each alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately relieving one another. The beſt drawing is when the tide is coming in: we were told that at a ſingle draught there were once eight hundred and forty fiſh taken.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="247" facs="tcp:1199500103:275"/>A few miles higher up the river is a ware, where a conſiderable number of fiſh that eſcape the nets are taken. We were lately informed, that in the year 1760 about 320 tons were taken in the <hi>Cranna</hi> fiſhery.</p>
                           <p>The ſalmon are cured in this manner: they are firſt ſplit, and rubbed with fine ſalt; and after ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in pickle in great tubs, or reſervoirs, for ſix weeks, are packed up with layers of coarſe brown <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſalt in caſks, ſix of which make a ton. Theſe are exported to <hi>Leghorn</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> at the price of twelve or thirteen pounds per ton, but formerly from ſixteen to twenty-four pounds each.</p>
                           <p>The ſalmon is a fiſh ſo generally known, <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> that a very brief deſcription will ſerve. The largeſt we ever heard of weighed ſeventy-four pounds. The color of the back and ſides are grey, ſometimes ſpotted with black, ſometimes plain: the covers of the gills are ſubject to the ſame variety: the belly ſilvery: the noſe ſharp pointed: the end of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der jaw in the males often turns up in form of a hook; ſometimes this curvature is very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: it is ſaid that they loſe this hook when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the ſea.</p>
                           <p>The teeth are lodged in the jaws and on the tongue, and are ſlender, but very ſharp.</p>
                           <p>The tail is a little forked.</p>

                           <p>THE ſamlet is the leſt of the trout kind, is frequent in the <hi>Wye,</hi> in the upper part of the <hi>Severn,</hi> and the rivers that run into it, in the north of <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Wales.</hi> It is by ſeveral imagined to be the fry of the ſalmon; but our reaſons for diſſenting from that opinion are theſe:
<list>
                                 <item>Firſt, It is well known that the ſalmon fry never
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1199500103:282"/>continue in the freſh waters the whole year; but as numerous as they appear on their firſt eſcape from the ſpawn, all vaniſh on the firſt vernal flood that happens, which ſweeps them into the ſea, and leaves ſcarce one behind.</item>
                                 <item>Secondly, The growth of the ſalmon fry is ſo quick and ſo conſiderable, as ſuddenly to exceed the bulk of the largeſt ſamlet: for example, the fry that have quitted the freſh water in the ſpring, not larger than gudgeons, return into it again a foot or more in length.</item>
                                 <item>Thirdly, The ſalmon attain a conſiderable bulk before they begin to breed: the ſamlets, on the contrary, are found male and female <note n="*" place="bottom">It has been vulgarly imagined, that there were no other than males of this ſpecies.</note>, (dſtinguiſhed by the milt and roe) of their common ſize.</item>
                                 <item>Fourthly, They are found in the freſh waters in all times of the year, and even at ſeaſons when the ſalmon fry have gained a conſiderable ſize. It is well known, that near <hi>Shrewſbury</hi> (where they are called <hi>Samſons</hi>) they are found in ſuch quantities in the month of <hi>September,</hi> that a ſkilful angler, in a coracle, will take with a fly from twelve to ſixteen dozen in a day.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>They ſpawn in <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> at which time thoſe of the <hi>Severn</hi> puſh up towards the head of that fair river, quitting the leſſer brooks, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into them again when they have done.</p>
                           <p>They have a general reſemblance to the trout, therefore muſt be deſcribed comparatively.</p>

                              <item>Firſt, The head is proportionably narrower, and the mouth leſs than that of the trout.</item>
                              <item>Secondly, Their body is deeper.</item>
                              <item>Thirdly, They ſeldom exceed ſix or ſeven inches in length.</item>
                              <item>Fourthly, The pectoral fins have generally but one large black ſpot, tho' ſometimes a ſingle ſmall one attends it; whereas the pectoral fins of the trout are more numerouſly marked.</item>
                              <item>Fifthly, The ſpurious or fat fin on the back is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tipped with red; nor is the edge of the anal fin white.</item>
                              <item>Sixthly, The ſpots on the body are fewer, and not ſo bright. It is alſo marked from the back to the ſides with ſix or ſeven large bluiſh bars; but this is not a certain character, as the ſame is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found in young trouts.</item>
                              <item>Seventhly, The tail of the ſamlet is much more forked than that of the trout.</item>

                           <p>
                              <pb n="258" facs="tcp:1199500103:287"/>The largeſt and moſt beautiful we ever received were taken in <hi>Winander Mere,</hi> and were communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to us by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Farriſh,</hi> of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> with an account of their natural hiſtory. He favored me with five ſpecimens, two under the name of the <hi>Caſe Charr,</hi> male and female; another he called the <hi>Gelt Charr,</hi> i. e. a charr which had not ſpawned the preceding ſeaſon, and on that account is reckoned to be in the greateſt perfection. The two others were inſcribed, the <hi>Red Charr, the Silver or Gilt Charr,</hi> the <hi>Carpio Lacus</hi> BENACI, <hi>Raii ſyn. piſc.</hi> 66, which laſt are in <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> diſtinguiſhed by the epithet <hi>red,</hi> by reaſon of the fleſh aſſuming a higher color than the other when dreſſed.</p>
                           <p>On the cloſeſt examination, <note place="margin">Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> we could not diſcover any ſpecific differences in theſe ſpecimens, therefore muſt deſcribe them as the ſame fiſh, ſubject only to a ſlight variation in their form, hereafter to be noted. But there is in another reſpect an eſſential difference, we mean in their oeconomy, which is in all beings invariable; the particulars we ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the very words of our obliging informant.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Umbla minor,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Spawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the caſe aharr.</note> or caſe charr, ſpawns about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and chiefly in the river <hi>Brathy,</hi> which uniting with another called the <hi>Rowthay,</hi> about a quarter of a mile above the lake, they both fall into it together. The <hi>Brathy</hi> has a black rocky bottom; the bottom of the <hi>Rowthay</hi> is a bright ſand, and into this the charr are never obſerved to enter. Some of them however ſpawn in the lake, but always in ſuch parts of it which are ſtony, and reſemble the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1199500103:288"/>channel of the <hi>Brathy.</hi> They are ſuppoſed to be in the higheſt perfection about <hi>May,</hi> and continue ſo all the ſummer, yet are rarely caught after <hi>April.</hi> When they are ſpawning in the river they will take a bait, but at no other time, being commonly taken, as well as the other ſpecies, in what they call <hi>breaſt nets,</hi> which are in length about twenty-four fathoms, and about five, where broadeſt.</p>
                           <p>The ſeaſon which the other ſpecies ſpawns in is from the beginning of <hi>January</hi> to the end of <hi>March.</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Gilt charr.</note> They are never known to aſcend the rivers, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in thoſe parts of the lake which are ſpringy, where the bottom is ſmooth and ſandy, and the water warmeſt. The fiſhermen judge of this warmth, by obſerving that the water ſeldom freezes in the places where they ſpawn, except in intenſe froſts, and then the ice is thinner than in other parts of the lake. They are taken in greateſt plenty from the end of <hi>September</hi> to the end of <hi>November:</hi> at other times they are hardly to be met with. This ſpecies is much more eſteemed for the table than the other, and is very delicate when potted.</p>
                           <p>We muſt obſerve, that this account of the ſpawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſon of the <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> charrs, agrees very nearly with that of thoſe of <hi>Wales,</hi> the laſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about a month later, keep moving from ſide to ſide of the pool, and then retire into the deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where they are ſometimes but rarely taken.</p>
                           <p>This remarkable circumſtance of the different ſeaſon of ſpawning in fiſh, apparently the ſame (for the red charr of <hi>Winander,</hi> is certainly not the

                           <p>We ſhall now deſcribe the varieties by the names aſcribed to them in the north.</p>
                           <p>The length of the red charr to the diviſion in its tail, <note place="margin">Red charr.</note> was twelve inches; its biggeſt circumference almoſt ſeven. The firſt dorſal fin five inches and three quarters from the tip of its noſe, and conſiſted of twelve branched rays; the firſt of which was ſhort, the fifth the longeſt: the fat fin was very ſmall.</p>
                           <p>Each of the five fiſh had double noſtrils, and ſmall teeth in the jaws, roof of the mouth, and on the tongue.</p>
                           <p>The head, back, dorſal fin, and tail of each, was of a duſky blue; the ſides rather paler, marked with numbers of bright red ſpots: the bellies of the <hi>Red Charr</hi> were of a full and rich red; thoſe of the <hi>Caſe Charr</hi> rather paler; from this particular the <hi>Welch</hi> call theſe fiſh <hi>Torgoch,</hi> or red belly.</p>
                           <p>The firſt rays of the anal and ventral fins of each, were of a pure white; the reſt of each fin on the lower part of the body, tinged with red.</p>
                           <p>The lateral line ſtrait, dividing the fiſh in two equal parts, or nearly ſo.</p>
                           <p>The jaws in the <hi>Caſe Charr</hi> are perfectly even; on the contrary, thoſe of the <hi>Red Charr</hi> were unequal,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1199500103:290"/>the upper jaw being the broadeſt, and the teeth hung over the lower, as might be perceived on paſſing the finger over them.</p>
                           <p>The branchioſtegous rays were, on different ſides of the ſame fiſh, unequal in number, viz. 12,—11, 11,—10, 10—9, except in one, where they were 11,—11.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Gelt,</hi> or <hi>Barren Charr,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Gelt charr.</note> was rather more ſlender than the others, as being without ſpawn. The back of a gloſſy duſky blue: the ſides filvery, mixed with blue, ſpotted with pale red: the ſides of the belly were of a pale red, the bottom white.</p>
                           <p>The tails of each bifurcated.</p>
                           <p>The charrs we have ſeen, brought from the <hi>Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> lakes, were rather ſmaller than thoſe of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland:</hi> their colors paler.

                           <p>They inhabit the ſeas that waſh theſe iſlands the whole year, and never go very remote from ſhore, except when they aſcend the rivers. It is remarked in certain rivers that they appear a long time before they ſpawn, being taken in great abundance in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, December,</hi> and <hi>January,</hi> in the <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Dee,</hi> but in others not till <hi>February,</hi> and in <hi>March</hi>

                           <p>Theſe fiſh vary greatly in ſize, but the largeſt we ever heard of was thirteen inches long, and weighed half a pound.</p>
                           <p>They have a very particular ſcent, from whence is derived one of their <hi>Engliſh</hi> names <hi>Smelt,</hi> i. e. ſmell it. That of <hi>Sparling,</hi> which is uſed in <hi>Wales,</hi> and the north of <hi>England,</hi> is taken from the <hi>French Eperlan.</hi> There is a wonderful diſagreement in the opinion of people in reſpect to the ſcent of this fiſh; ſome aſſert it flavors of the violet; the <hi>Germans,</hi> for a very different reaſon, diſtinguiſh it by the elegant title of <hi>Stinckfiſch.</hi>

                           <p>The firſt dorſal fin has eleven rays; the pectoral fins the ſame number; the ventral eight; the anal fourteen.</p>
                           <p>The ſcales are ſmall, and readily drop off: the tail conſiſts of nineteen rays, and is forked.</p>
                           <p>The color of the back is whitiſh, with a caſt of green, beneath which it is varied with blue, and then ſucceeds a beautiful gloſs of a ſilvery hue.</p>

                           <p>The <hi>Southampton</hi> ſmelt agrees with the common kind in having two back fins, but both of them are radiated; the firſt with eight radii, the ſecond with twelve; the belly fins have only five or ſix radii: the upper jaw is longer than the lower, and has a few teeth, whereas the lower has none: in color, tranſparency of the back and head, ſilver ſtripes on the ſides, forked tail, &amp;c. it agrees nearly with the former, but has nothing of the violet ſmell or taſte. It ſwarms in that ſea, and is the common bait for whiting, mackrell, flat-fiſh, &amp;c. It is eaten fried, is tender and ſweet, and without any ſmall bones, but muſt be gutted before it is dreſſed. It grows to three or four inches in length, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly much leſs.</p>

We have known one that was choaked by attempting to ſwallow one of its own ſpecies that proved too large a morſel. It does not confine itſelf to feed on fiſh and frogs; it will devour the water rat, and draw down the young ducks as they are ſwimming about. In a manuſcript note which we found, p. 244, of our copy of <hi>Plott</hi>'s Hiſtory of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> is the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing extraordinary fact: <q>At Lord <hi>Gower</hi>'s ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal at <hi>Trentham,</hi> a pike ſeized the head of a ſwan as ſhe was feeding under water, and gorged ſo much of it as killed them both.

                           <p>THIS fiſh which is known in many places, is known by the name of the <hi>Sea Needle.</hi> It comes in ſhoals on our coaſts in the beginning of ſummer, and precedes the mackrel: it has a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to it in taſte, but the light green, which ſtains the back bone of this fiſh when boiled, gives many people a diſguſt to it.</p>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> tells us, that when he was in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> the fiſhermen gave him the names of two ſpecies of this fiſh, one they called <hi>Girrocks,</hi> the other <hi>Skippers;</hi> theſe we may ſuppoſe to be the common kind, the other (according to Mr. <hi>Jago</hi>'s conjecture) is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the ſame with the <hi>Saurus</hi> of <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Saurus.</note> p. 232, which both thoſe icthyologiſts agree has a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noſe than the common ſpecies. We have no other deſcription of this fiſh than what is left us by <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deletius,</hi> who ſays, that it is ſhorter and thicker than the other; that the noſe is ſhorter and turns up; that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1199500103:305"/>the edges of the jaws are ſerrated; and that between the anal fin and the tail it has ſeveral ſpurious fins like the mackrel. We do not venture to make a diſtinct article of this fiſh, becauſe Mr. <hi>Jago</hi> has not pointed out the ſpecific difference; but we thought it neceſſary to give this brief deſcription of it from <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> to ſupply that defect in caſe the <hi>Saurus</hi> ſhould prove a <hi>Britiſh</hi> fiſh.</p>
                           <p>The common ſea pike, or ſea needle, <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> ſometimes grows to the length of three feet, or more.</p>
                           <p>The jaws are very long, ſlender, and ſharp pointed; the under extends much farther than the upper, and the edges of both are armed with numbers of ſhort ſlender teeth: the inſide of the mouth is purple: the tongue ſmall: the eyes large: the irides ſilvery: the noſtrils wide and round.</p>
                           <p>The body is ſlender: the belly quite flat, bounded on both ſides by a rough line.</p>
                           <p>The pectoral fins conſiſt of twelve rays; the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral fins ſmall, and placed very remote from the head, conſiſts of ſix rays, the firſt ſpiny.</p>
                           <p>The dorſal fin lies on the very lower part of the back, conſiſts of eighteen rays; the firſt are high, the others lower as they approach the tail; the anal fin is of the ſame form, and placed oppoſite the other: the tail is forked.</p>
                           <p>The colors are extremely beautiful when the fiſh is in the water: the back of a fine green, beneath that appears a rich changeable blue and purple: the ſides and belly are of a fine ſilvery hue.</p>

                           <p>THE mullet is juſtly ranked by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> among the <hi>Piſces Littorales,</hi> or thoſe that prefer the ſhores to the full ſea: they are found in great plenty on ſeveral of the ſandy coaſts of our iſland, and haunt in particular thoſe ſmall bays that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes of freſh water. They come in great ſhoals, and keep rooting like hogs in the ſand or mud, leaving their traces in form of large round holes. They are very cunning, and when ſurrounded with a net, the whole ſhoal frequently eſcapes by leaping over it, for when one takes the lead, the others are ſure to follow: this circumſtance is taken notice of by <hi>Oppian;</hi> whether the latter part of his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is true, is what we are uncertain.</p>

                           <p>The great winter rendezvous of the herring is within the <hi>Arctic</hi> circle: there they continue for many months in order to recruit themſelves after the fatigue of ſpawning, the ſeas within that ſpace ſwarming with inſect food, in a degree far greater than in our warmer latitudes.</p>
                           <p>This mighty army begins to put itſelf in motion in the ſpring; <note place="margin">Migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> we diſtinguiſh this vaſt body by that name, for the word herring is derived from the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Heer,</hi> an army, to expreſs their numbers.</p>
                           <p>They begin to appear off the <hi>Shetland</hi> iſles in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May;</hi> theſe are only forerunners of the grand ſhoal which comes in <hi>June,</hi> and their appearance is marked by certain ſigns by the numbers of birds, ſuch as gannets, and others which follow to prey on them: but when the main body approaches, its breadth and its depth is ſuch as to alter the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the very ocean. It is divided into diſtinct columns of five or ſix miles in length, and three or four in breadth, and they drive the water before them with a kind of rippling: ſometimes they ſlink for the ſpace of ten or fifteen minutes, then riſe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:1199500103:316"/>again to the ſurface, and in bright weather reflect a variety of ſplendid colors, like a field of the moſt pretious gems, in which, or rather in a much more valuable light, ſhould this ſtupendous gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence be conſidered by the inhabitants of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> iſles.</p>
                           <p>The firſt check this army meets in its march ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <note place="margin">Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> is from the <hi>Shetland</hi> iſles, which divide it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts; one wing takes to the eaſt, the other to the weſtern ſhores of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and fill every bay and creek with their numbers; others paſs on towards <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> the great and antient mart of herrings; they then paſs thro' the <hi>Britiſh</hi> channel, and after that in a manner diſappear. Thoſe which take to the weſt, after offering themſelves to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brides,</hi> where the great ſtationary fiſhery is, proceed towards the north of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they meet with a ſecond interruption, and are obliged to make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond diviſion; the one takes to the weſtern ſide, and is ſcarce perceived, being ſoon loſt in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of the <hi>Atlantic;</hi> but the other, which paſſes into the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſea, rejoices and feeds the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of moſt of the coaſts that border on it.</p>
                           <p>Theſe brigades, as we may call them, which are thus ſeparated from the greater columns, are often capricious in their motions, and do not ſhew an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable attachment to their haunts. We have had in our time inſtances of their entirely quitting the coaſts of <hi>Cardiganſhire,</hi> and viſiting thoſe of <hi>Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narvonſhire</hi> and <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> where they continued for a few years, but in the preſent year have quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted our ſea, and returned to their old ſeats. The
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1199500103:317"/>ſeaſon of their appearance among us was very late, never before the latter end of <hi>November:</hi> their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance till <hi>February.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Were we inclined to conſider this partial migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the herring in a moral light, <note place="margin">Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential inſtinct.</note> we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect with veneration and awe on the mighty Power which originally impreſſed on this moſt uſeful body of his creatures, the inſtinct that directs and points out the courſe, that bleſſes and enriches theſe iſlands, which cauſes them at certain and invariable times to quit the vaſt polar deeps, and offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our expecting fleets. That benevolent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has never, from the earlieſt records, been once known to withdraw this bleſſing from the whole, tho' he often thinks proper to deny it to particulars; yet this partial failure (for which we ſee no natural reaſon) ſhould fill us with the moſt exalted and grareful ſenſe of his Providence, for impreſſing ſo invariable and general inſtinct on theſe fiſh towards a ſouthward migration, when the whole is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited, and to withdraw it only when a minute part is to ſuffer.</p>
                           <p>This inſtinct was given them, <note place="margin">Spawa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move for the ſake of depoſiting their ſpawn in warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſeas, that would mature and vivify it more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly than thoſe of the frigid zone. It is not from defect of food that they ſet themſelves in motion, for they come to us full and fat, and on their return are almoſt univerſally obſerved to be lean and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. What their food is near the pole, we are not yet informed; but in our ſeas they feed much on the <hi>Oniſcus Marinus,</hi> a cruſtaceous inſect, <note place="margin">Food.</note> and ſometimes on their own fry.</p>

Tho' we have no particular authority for it, <note place="margin">Return.</note> yet as very few young herrings are found in our ſeas during winter, it ſeems moſt certain that they muſt return to their parental haunts beneath the ice, to repair the vaſt deſtruction of their race during ſummer, by men, fowl and fiſh.

                           <p>The eye is very large: the edges of the upper jaw and the tongue are very rough, but the whole mouth
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1199500103:319"/>is void of teeth: the gill covers are very looſe, and open very wide; which occaſions the almoſt inſtant death of the herring when taken out of the water, which is well known, even to a proverb.</p>
                           <p>The dorſal fin conſiſts of about ſeventeen rays, and is placed beyond the centre of gravity, ſo that when the fiſh is ſuſpended by it, the head immediately dips down: the two ventral fins have nine rays; the pectoral ſeventeen; the anal fourteen: the tail is much forked.</p>
                           <p>The lateral line is not apparent, unleſs the ſcales are taken off: the ſides are compreſſed: the belly ſharply carinated, but the ridge quite ſmooth, and not in the leſt ſerrated.</p>
                           <p>The ſcales are large, thin, and fall off with a ſlight touch.</p>
                           <p>The color of the back and ſides green, <note place="margin">Color.</note> varied with blue: the belly ſilvery.</p>
                           <p>The herring fiſhery is of great antiquity: <note place="margin">Fiſhery.</note> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious <hi>Dutch</hi> firſt engaged in it about the year 1164: they were in poſſeſſion of it for ſeveral cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, but at length its value become ſo juſtly to be known, that it gave riſe to moſt obſtinate and well-diſputed wars between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and them; but ſtill their diligence and ſkill gives them a ſuperiority over us in that branch of trade.</p>

                           <p>THE pilchard appears in vaſt ſhoals off the <hi>Corniſh</hi> coaſts, about the middle of <hi>July,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear the beginning of winter, yet ſometimes a few return again after <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> Their winter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat is the ſame with that of the herring, and their motives for migrating the ſame. They affect, during ſummer, a warmer latitude, for they are not found in any quantities on any of our coaſts except thoſe of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> that is to ſay, from <hi>Fowey</hi> harbor to the <hi>Scilly</hi> iſles, between which places the ſhoals keep ſhifting for ſome weeks.</p>
                           <p>The approach of the pilchard is known by much the ſame ſigns as thoſe that indicate the arrival of the herring. Perſons, called in <hi>Cornwall Huers,</hi> are placed on the cliffs, to point to the boats ſtationed off the land the courſe of the fiſh. By the 1ſt of <hi>James</hi> 1. c. 23. fiſhermen are empowered to go on the grounds of others to <hi>bue,</hi> without being liable to actions of treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, which before occaſioned frequent lawſuits.</p>
                           <p>The emoluments that accrue to the inhabitants of that county are great, and are beſt expreſſed in the words of Doctor <hi>W. Borlaſe,</hi> in his account of the <hi>Pilchard</hi> fiſhery.</p>
                           <p>

                              <q>It employs a great number of men on the ſea, training them thereby to naval affairs; employs men, women, and children, at land, in ſalting, preſſing, waſhing, and cleaning, in making boats, nets, ropes, caſks, and all the trades de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on their conſtruction and ſale. The poor is fed with the offals of the captures, the land with the refuſe of the fiſh and ſalt, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant finds the gains of commiſſion and honeſt commerce, the fiſherman the gains of the fiſh. Ships are often freighted hither with ſalt, and into foreign countries with the fiſh, carrying off at the ſame time part of our tin. The uſual produce of the number of hogſheads exported each year, for ten years, from 1747 to 1756 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, from the four ports of <hi>Fawy, Falmouth, Penzance,</hi> and <hi>St. Ives,</hi> it appears that <hi>Fawy</hi> has exported yearly 1732 hogſheads; <hi>Falmouth,</hi> 14631 hogſheads and two-thirds; <hi>Penzance</hi> and <hi>Mounts-Bay,</hi> 12149 hogſheads and one-third; <hi>St. Ives,</hi> 1282 hogſheads: in all amounting to 29795 hogſheads. Every hogſhead for ten years laſt paſt, together with the bounty allowed for each hogſhead exported, and the oil made out of each hogſhead, has amounted, one year with another at an average, to the price of one pound thirteen ſhillings and three-pence; ſo that the caſh paid for pilchards exported has, at a medium, annually amounted to the ſum of forty-nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred and thirty-two pounds ten ſhillings.</q>

                              <pb n="293" facs="tcp:1199500103:324"/>The numbers that are taken at one ſhooting out of the nets, is amazingly great. Doctor <hi>Borlaſe</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me, that on the 5th of <hi>October,</hi> 1767, there were at one time incloſed in <hi>St. Ives's Bay</hi> 7000 hogſheads, each hogſhead containing 35000 fiſh, in all 245000000.</p>
                           <p>This fiſh has a general likeneſs to the herring, <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> but differs in ſome particulars very eſſentially; we therefore deſcribe it comparatively with the other, having one of each ſpecies before us, both of them of the ſame length, <hi>viz.</hi> nine inches and an half.</p>
                           <p>The body of the pilchard is leſs compreſſed than that of the herring, being thicker and rounder: the noſe is ſhorter in proportion, and turns up: the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der jaw is ſhorter.</p>
                           <p>The back is more elevated: the belly leſs ſharp: the dorſal fin of the pilchard is placed exactly in the centre of gravity, ſo that when taken up by it, the body preſerves an equilibrium, whereas that of the herring dips at the head: the dorſal fin of the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard we examined, being placed only three inches eight tenths from the tip of the noſe; that of the herring four inches one tenth.</p>
                           <p>The ſcales of the pilchard adhere very cloſely, whereas thoſe of the herring very eaſily drop off.</p>
                           <p>The pilchard is in general leſs than the herring; the ſpecimen we deſcribe being a very large one. The pilchard is fatter, or more full of oil.</p>

                           <p>MR. <hi>Willoughby</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> were of opinion, that theſe fiſh were the fry of the herring: we are induced to diſſent from them, not only becauſe on comparing a ſprat and young herring of equal ſize, we diſcovered ſome ſpecific differences, but likewiſe for another reaſon: the former viſits our coaſts, and continue with us in ſhoals innumerable, when the others in general have retired to the great northern deeps.</p>
                           <p>They come into the river <hi>Thames,</hi> below bridge, the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> and leave it in <hi>March,</hi> and are, during their ſeaſon, a great relief to the poor of the capital.</p>
                           <p>At <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> they are cured like red herrings; they are ſometimes pickled, and are little inferior in flavor to the <hi>Anchovy,</hi> but the bones will not diſſolve like thoſe of the latter. Mr. <hi>Forſter</hi> tells me, that in the <hi>Baltic</hi> they preſerve them in the ſame manner, and call them <hi>Breitling,</hi> i. e. the little deep fiſh, as being deeper than the <hi>Stromling,</hi> or <hi>Baltic</hi> herring.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="295" facs="tcp:1199500103:326"/>The ſprat grows to about the length of five inches: <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> the body is much deeper than that of a young herring of equal length: the back fin is placed more remote from the noſe than that of the herring, and we think had ſixteen rays. But the great diſtinction between this fiſh, the herring and pilchard, is the belly: that of the two firſt being quite ſmooth, that of the laſt moſt ſtrongly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>

They are there a great article of commerce, and ſent in well-boats to <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants purchaſe them out of the waters of the <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſe</hi> of the country, who draw a good revenue from this article.

                           <p>The antients do not ſeparate the carp from the ſea fiſh. We are credibly informed that they are ſometimes found in the harbor of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> between the town and a ſmall place called <hi>Hela.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <pb n="302" facs="tcp:1199500103:333"/>An experiment has been made by placing a carp in a net, well wrapped up in wet moſs, the mouth only remaining out, and then hung up in a cellar, or ſome cool place: the fiſh is frequently fed with white bread and milk, and is beſides often plunged into water. Carp thus managed have been known, not only to have lived above a fortnight, but to grow exceedingly fat, and far ſuperior in taſte to thoſe that are immediately killed from the pond <note n="*" place="bottom">This was told me by a gentleman of the utmoſt veracity, who had twice made the experiment. The ſame fact is related by that pious Philoſopher Doctor <hi>Derham,</hi> in his <hi>Phyſico-Theology,</hi> edit. 9th. 1737. <hi>ch.</hi> i. <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>n. e.</hi>

                           <p>The carp is a prodigious breeder: <note place="bottom">Foecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</note> its quantity of roe has been ſometimes found ſo great, that when taken out and weighed againſt the fiſh itſelf, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer has been found to preponderate. We have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore in this work to enter into minute calculations of the numbers each fiſh may produce. It has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been moſt ſkilfully performed by Mr. <hi>Harmer,</hi> and printed in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions</hi> of the year 1767. We ſhall, in our Appendix, take the liberty of borrowing ſuch part of his tables of the foecundity of fiſh, as will demonſtrate the kind at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Providence, towards the preſerving ſo uſeful a claſs of animals for the ſervice of its other creatures.</p>
                           <p>Theſe fiſh are extremely cunning, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count are by ſome ſtyled the <hi>river fox.</hi> They will ſometimes leap over the nets, and eſcape that way; at others, will immerſe themſelves ſo deep in the mud, as to let the net paſs over them. They are
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:1199500103:334"/>alſo very ſhy of taking a bait; yet at the ſpawning time they are ſo ſimple, as to ſuffer themſelves to be tickled, handled, and caught by any body that will attempt it.</p>
                           <p>This fiſh is apt to mix its milt with the roe of other fiſh, <note place="margin">Spurious breed.</note> from which is produced a ſpurious breed: we have ſeen the offspring of the carp and tench, which bore the greateſt reſemblance to the firſt: we have alſo heard of the ſame mixture between the carp and bream.</p>
                           <p>The carp is of a thick ſhape: the ſcales very large, <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> and when in beſt ſeaſon of a fine gilded hue.</p>
                           <p>The jaws are of equal length; there are two teeth in the jaws, or on the tongue; but at the entrance of the gullet, above and below, are certain bones that act on each other, and comminute the food be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it paſſes down.</p>
                           <p>On each ſide of the mouth is a ſingle beard; above thoſe on each ſide another, but ſhorter: the dorſal fin extends far towards the tail, which is a little bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furcated; the third ray of the dorſal fin is very ſtrong, and armed with ſharp teeth, pointing down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; the third ray of the anal fin is conſtructed in the ſame manner.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>That the <hi>Scarus</hi> was not our <hi>Chub,</hi> is very evident; not only becauſe the <hi>Chub</hi> is entirely an inhabitant of freſh waters, but likewiſe it ſeems improbable that the <hi>Romans</hi> would give themſelves any trouble about the worſt of river fiſh, when they neglected the moſt delicious kinds; all their attention was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected towards thoſe of the ſea: the difficulty of procuring them ſeems to have been the criterion of their value, as is ever the caſe with effete luxury.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="314" facs="tcp:1199500103:345"/>The chub is a very coarſe fiſh and full of bones: it frequents the deep holes of rivers, and during ſummer commonly lies on the ſurface, beneath the ſhade of ſome tree or buſh. It is a very timid fiſh, ſinking to the bottom on the leſt alarm, even at the paſſing of a ſhadow, but they will ſoon reſume their ſituation. It feeds on worms, caterpillars, graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers, beetles, and other coleopterous inſects that happen to fall into the water; and it will even feed on cray-fiſh. It is the only fiſh of this genus that will rife to a fly.</p>
                           <p>This fiſh takes its name from its head, not only in our own, but in other languages; we call it <hi>Chub,</hi> according to <hi>Skinner,</hi> from the old <hi>Engliſh, Cop,</hi> a head; the <hi>French, Teſtard;</hi> the <hi>Italians, Capitone.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It does not grow to a large ſize; we have known ſome that weighed above five pounds, but <hi>Salvianus</hi> ſpeaks of others that were eight or nine pounds in weight.</p>
                           <p>The body is oblong, rather round, and of a pretty equal thickneſs the greateſt part of the way: the ſcales are large.</p>
                           <p>The irides ſilvery; the cheeks of the ſame color: the head and back of a deep duſky green: the ſides ſilvery, but in the ſummer yellow: the belly white: the pectoral fins of a pale yellow: the ventral and anal fins red: the tail a little forked, of a browniſh hue, but tinged with blue at the end.</p>

                           <p>They are very common in many of our rivers, and keep together in large ſhoals. Theſe fiſh ſeem at certain ſeaſons to be affected with the vertigo; they tumble about near the ſurface of the water, and are incapable of ſwimming far from the place, but in about two hours recover, and diſappear. Fiſh thus affected the <hi>Thames</hi> fiſhermen call <hi>mad bleaks.</hi>

                           <p>Artificial pearls are made with ſcales of this fiſh, <note place="margin">Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial pearls.</note> and we think of the dace. They are beat into a fine powder, then diluted with water, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into a thin glaſs bubble, which is afterwards filled with wax. The <hi>French</hi> were the inventors of this art. Doctor <hi>Liſter</hi> 
                              <note n="*" place="bottom">Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> 142.</note> tells us, that when he was at <hi>Paris,</hi> a certain artiſt uſed in one winter thirty hampers full of fiſh in this manufacture.</p>

                              <pb n="316" facs="tcp:1199500103:347"/>The bleak ſeldom exceeds five or ſix inches in length: <note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> their body is ſlender, greatly compreſſed ſideways, not unlike that of the ſprat.</p>
                           <p>The eyes are large: the irides of a pale yellow: the under jaw the longeſt: the lateral line crooked: the gills ſilvery: the back green: the ſides and belly ſilvery: the fins pellucid: the ſcales fall off very eaſily: the tail much forked.</p>
                           <p>During the month of <hi>July</hi> thoſe appear in the <hi>Thames,</hi>

                           <p>There are various conjectures about this ſpecies, but all terminate in a ſuppoſition that they are the fry of ſome fiſh, but few agree to which kind they owe their origin. Some attribute it to the ſhad, others to the ſprat, the ſmelt, and the bleak. That they neither belong to the ſhad, nor the ſprat, is evident from the number of branchioſtegous rays, which in thoſe are eight, in this only three. That they are not the young of ſmelts is as clear, becauſe they want the <hi>pinna adipoſa,</hi> or rayleſs fin; and that they are not the offspring of the bleak is extremely probable, ſince we never heard of the white bait being found in any other river, notwithſtanding the bleak is very common in ſeveral of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſtreams: but as the white bait bears a greater ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity to this fiſh than to any other we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:1199500103:348"/>we give it a place here as an appendage to the bleak, rather than form a diſtinct article of a fiſh which it is impoſſible to claſs with certainty.</p>
                           <p>It is evident that it is of the carp or <hi>Cyprinus</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus: it has only three branchioſtegous rays, and only one dorſal fin; and in reſpect to the form of the body is compreſſed like that of the bleak.</p>
                           <p>Its uſual length is two inches: the under jaw is the longeſt: the irides ſilvery, the pupil black: the dorſal fin is placed nearer to the head than to the tail, and conſiſts of about fourteen rays: the ſide line is ſtrait: the tail forked, the tips black.</p>

                           <p>They were firſt introduced into <hi>England</hi> about the year 1691, but were not generally known till 1728, when a great number were brought over, and preſented firſt to Sir <hi>Mathew Dekker,</hi> and by him circulated round the neighborhood of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> from whence they have been diſtributed to moſt parts of the country.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>China</hi> the moſt beautiful kinds are taken in a ſmall lake in the province of <hi>Che-Kyang.</hi> Every perſon of faſhion keeps them for amuſement, either in porcellane veſſels, or in the ſmall baſons that decorate the courts of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> houſes.

                           <p>The colors vary greatly; ſome are marked with a fine blue, with brown, with bright ſilver; but the general and predominant color is gold of a moſt amazing ſplendor; but their colors and form need not be dwelt on, ſince thoſe who want opportunity of ſeeing the living fiſh, may ſurvey them expreſſed in the moſt animated manner, in the works of our ingenious and honeſt friend Mr. <hi>George Edwards.</hi>

            <p>The late Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle</hi> informed me that a tortoiſe was taken off the coaſt of <hi>Scarborough</hi> in 1748 or 1749. <note place="margin">Tortoiſe, page <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> It was purchaſed by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at that time there, and a good deal of company invited to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it.

            <p>The gentlemen I am principally indebted to for my informations are <hi>J. Arſcott,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Tehott,</hi> in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pitfield,</hi> of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Some of theſe accounts were addreſſed to Doctor <hi>Milles,</hi> Dean of <hi>Exeter;</hi> others to the worthy Prelate abovementioned, to whom I owe theſe and many other agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able correſpondencies; others again to myſelf.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Arſcott</hi>'s letters give a very ample hiſtory of the nature of the toad: they were both addreſſed to Doctor <hi>Milles,</hi> and both were the reſult of certain queries I propoſed, which the former was ſo obliging as to give himſelf the trouble of anſwering in a moſt ſatisfactory manner.</p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt take the liberty of citing Mr. <hi>Arſcott</hi>'s letter of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> the 23d, 1768, which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſome very curious particulars of this innocent reptile, which, for ſuch a number of years found an aſylum, from the good ſenſe of a
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:1199500103:354"/>family which ſoared above all vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar prejudices.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It would give me the greateſt pleaſure to be able to inform you of any particulars worthy Mr. <hi>Pennant</hi>'s notice, concerning the toad who lived ſo many years with us, and was ſo great a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. The greateſt curioſity in it was its becoming ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably tame. It had frequented ſome ſteps before the hall-door ſome years before my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance commenced with it, and had been admired by my father for its ſize (which was of the largeſt I ever met with) who conſtantly payed it a viſit every evening. I knew it myſelf above thirty years, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly feeding it, brought it to be ſo tame that it always came to the candle, and looked up as if expecting to be taken up and brought upon the table, where I always fed it with inſects of all ſorts: it was fondeſt of fleſh maggots, which I kept in bran; it would follow them, and when within a proper diſtance, would fix its eye, and remain motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for near a quarter of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1199500103:355"/>as if preparing for the ſtroke, which was an inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous throwing its tongue at a great diſtance upon the inſect, which ſtuck to the tip by a gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous matter: the motion is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the eye can follow <note n="*" place="bottom">This rapid capture of its prey might give occaſion to the report of its faſcinating powers. <hi>Linnaeus</hi> ſays, <hi>Inſecta in ſauces faſcine revocat.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>I always imagined that the root of its tongue was placed in the fore part of its under jaw, and the tip towards its throat, by which the motion muſt be a half circle; by which, when its tongue recovered its ſituation, the inſect at the tip would be brought to the place of deglutition. I was confirmed in this by never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving any internal motion in its mouth, excepting one ſwallow the inſtant its tongue returned. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly I might be miſtaken, for I never diſſected one, but contented myſelf with opening its mouth, and ſlightly inſpecting it.</p>
               <p>You may imagine that a toad generally deteſted (altho' one of the moſt inoffenſive of all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals) ſo much taken notice of and befriended, excited the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:1199500103:356"/>of all comers to the houſe, who all deſired to ſee it fed, ſo that even ladies ſo far conquered the horrors inſtilled into them by nurfes, as to deſire to ſee it. This produced innumerable and improbable reports, making it as large as the crown of a hat, &amp;c. &amp;c. This I hope will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for my not giving you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars more worth your notice. When I firſt read the account in the papers of toads ſucking can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous breaſts, I did not believe a word of it, not thinking it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to ſuck, having no lips to embrace the part, and a tongue ſo oddly formed; but as the fact is thoroughly verified, I moſt impatiently long to be fully informed of all particulars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it</p>
            </q>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe accounts will ſerve to point out ſome errors I had adopted, in reſpect to this reptile in my firſt ſheet, yet it is with much pleaſure I lay before the public a more authentic hiſtory, collected from Mr. <hi>Arſcott</hi>'s ſecond favor; the anſwer points out my queries, which it is needleſs to repeat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:1199500103:357"/>
               <hi>Tehott, Nov.</hi> 1, 1768.</p>
            <q>
               <p>In reſpect to the queries I ſhall here give the moſt ſatisfactory anſwers I am capable of.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I cannot ſay how long my father had been acquainted with the toad before I knew it; but when I firſt was acquainted with it, he uſed to mention it as the old toad I've known ſo many years; I can anſwer for thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſix years.</p>
               <p>Secondly, No toads that I ever ſaw appeared in the winter ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The old toad made its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as ſoon as the warm wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came, and I always concluded it retired to ſome dry bank to repoſe till the ſpring. When we new-lay'd the ſteps I had two holes made in the third ſtep on each, with a hollow of more than a yard long for it, in which I imagine it ſlept, as it came from thence at its firſt appearance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It was ſeldom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked: neither that toad (nor the multitudes I have ſeen tormented with great cruelty) ever ſhewed the leſt deſire of revenge, by ſpitting or emitting any juice from their pimples. Sometimes
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:1199500103:358"/>upon taking it up it would let out a great quantity of clear water, which, as I have often ſeen it do the ſame upon the ſteps when quite quict, was certainly its urine, and no more than a natural evacuation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A toad has no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar enmity for the ſpider; he uſed to eat five or ſix with his millepides (which I take to be its chief food) that I generally provided for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I found out that fleſh maggots, by their continual motion, was the moſt tempting bait; but when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it eat blowing flies and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bees that come from the rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed maggot in gutters, or in ſhort any inſect that moved. I imagine if a bee was to be put before a toad, it would certainly eat it to its coſt; but as bees are ſeldom ſtirring at the ſame time that toads are, they can ſeldom come in their way, as they ſeldom appear after ſun-riſing, or before ſun-ſet. In the heat of the day they will come to the mouth of their hole, I believe, for air. I once from my parlour window obſerved a large toad I had in the bank of a bowling-green, about twelve at noon, a very hot day, very buſy and active upon the graſs; ſo uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:1199500103:359"/>an appearance made me go out to ſee what it was, when I found an innumerable ſwarm of winged ants had dropped round his hole, which temptation was as irreſiſtible as a turtle would be to a luxurious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Whether our toad ever propagated its ſpecies I know not, rather think not, as it always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared well, and not leſſened in bulk, which it muſt have done, I ſhould think, if it had diſcharged ſo large a quantity of ſpawn as toads generally do. The females that are to propagate in the ſpring, I imagine, inſtead of retiring to dry holes, go into the bottom of ponds, and lay torpid amongſt the weeds; for to my great ſurprize in the middle of the winter, having for amuſement put a long pole into my pond, and twiſted it till it had gathered a large volume of weed, on taking it off I found many toads, and having cut ſome aſunder with my knife, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, to get off the weed, found them full of ſpawn not thoroughly formed. I am not poſitive, but think there were a few males in <hi>March:</hi> I know there are thirty
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:1199500103:360"/>males <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>John Hunter</hi> has aſſured me that during his reſidence at <hi>Belleiſle,</hi> he diſſected ſome hundreds of toads, yet never met with a ſingle female among them.</note> to one female, twelve or fourteen of whom I have ſeen cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round a female: I have often diſengaged her, and put her into a ſolitary male, to ſee with what eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he would ſeize her. They im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the ſpawn as it is drawn <note n="**" place="bottom">I was incredulous as to the <hi>obſtetrical</hi> offices of the male toad, but ſince the end is ſo well accounted for, and the fact eſtabliſhed by ſuch good authority, belief muſt take place.
<p>Mr. <hi>Demours,</hi> in the Memoirs of the <hi>French</hi> Academy, as tranſlated by Dr. <hi>Templeman, vol.</hi> I. 371. has been very particular in reſpect to the male toad, as acting the part of an <hi>Accoucheur;</hi> his account is curious, and clames a place here:
<q>
                           <p>In the evening of one of the long days in ſummer, Mr. <hi>Demours</hi> being in the king's garden perceived two toads <hi>cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together</hi> at the edge of an hole, which was formed in part by a great ſtone at the top.</p>
                           <p>Curioſity drew him to ſee what was the occaſion of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he obſerved, when two facts equally new ſurprized him; the <hi>firſt</hi> was the extreme difficulty the female had in laying her eggs, inſomuch that ſhe did not ſeem capable of being delivered of them without ſome aſſiſtance. The <hi>ſecond</hi> was, that the male was mounted on the back of the female, and exerted all his ſtrength with his hinder feet in pulling out the eggs, whilſt his fore-feet embraced her breaſt.</p>
                           <p>In order to apprehend the manner of his working in the delivery of the female, the reader muſt obſerve that the paws of theſe animals, as well thoſe of the fore-feet as of the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are divided into ſeveral toes, which can perform the office of fingers.</p>
                           <p>It muſt be remarked likewiſe, that the eggs of this ſpecies of toads are included each in a membranous coat that is very firm, in which is contained the embryo; and that theſe eggs, which are oblong and about two lines in length, being faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one to another by a ſhort but very ſtrong cord form a kind of chaplet, the beads of which are diſtant from each other about the half of their length. It is by drawing this cord with his paw that the male performs the function of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, and acquits himſelf in it with a dexterity that one would not expect from ſo lumpiſh an animal.</p>
                           <p>The preſence of the obſerver did not a little diſcompoſe the male; for ſome time he ſtopped ſhort, and threw on the <hi>curious impertinent</hi> a fixed look that marked his diſquietneſs and fear; but he ſoon returned to his work with more precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than before, and a moment <hi>after</hi> he appeared undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whether he ſhould continue it or not. The female like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcovered her uneaſineſs at the ſight of the ſtranger, by motions that interrupted ſometimes the male in his operation. At length, whether the ſilence and ſteady poſture of the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator had diſſipated their fear, or that the <hi>caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </hi> was urgent, the male reſumed his work with the ſame vigour, and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully performed his function.</p>

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:1199500103:361"/>many yards long, not in a large, quantity of jelly, like frogs ſpawn. <hi>N. B.</hi> After having held a female ſome time in my hand, I have, to try if there was any ſmell, put my finger a foot under water to a male, who has immediately ſeized it, and ſtuck to as firmly as if it was a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male. <hi>Quere,</hi> Would they ſeize a finger or rag that had touched a cancerous ulcer?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Inſects being their food, I never ſaw any toad ſhew any lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diſlike to any plant <note n="*" place="bottom">This queſtion aroſe from an aſſertion of <hi>Linnoeus,</hi> that the toad delighted in filthy herbs. <hi>Delectatur Cotula, Actoea, Stachyde foetidis.</hi> The unhappy deformity of the animal ſeems to be the only ground of this as well as another miſrepreſentation, of its conveying a poiſon from its pimples, its touch, and even its breath. <hi>Verrucae lactejcentes venenatoe infuſoe tactu, anhelitu.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, I hardly remember any perſons taking it up except
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:1199500103:362"/>my father and myſelf: I do not know whether it had any particular attachment to us.</p>
               <p>Eighhtly, In reſpect to its end, I anſwer this laſt quere. Had it not been for a tame raven, I make no doubt but it would have been now living; who one day ſeeing it at the mouth of its hole, pulled it out, and although I reſcued it, pulled out one eye, and hurt it ſo, that notwithſtanding its living a twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month it never enjoyed itſelf, and had a difficulty of taking its food, miſſing the mark for want of its eye: before that accident had all the appearance of perfect health.</p>
            </q>
            <p>What Mr. <hi>Pitfield</hi> communicated to me ſerves farther to evince the patient and pacific diſpoſition of this poor ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. If I am thought to dwell too long on the ſubject, let it be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thoſe who have moſt unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked enemies, and feweſt friends, clame the greateſt pity, and warmeſt vindication. This reptile has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone all ſorts of ſcandal; one author makes it the companion of an atheiſt <note n="*" place="bottom">A great toad was ſaid to have been found in the lodgings of <hi>Vanini,</hi> at <hi>Toulouſe.

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:1199500103:363"/>its inmate; in a word, all kind of evil paſſions have been beſtowed on it: It is but juſtice therefore to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in behalf of an animal that has of late had ſo many tryals of its temper, from experiments occaſioned by the new diſcovery of its cancer-ſucking quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It has born all the handling, teiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bagging, &amp;c. &amp;c. without the leſt ſign of a vindictive diſpoſition; but has even made itſelf a ſacrifice to the diſcharge of its office: this I know from the reſult of much enquiry; would I could contradict what is aſſerted, p. 10, of the inefficacy of the tryals made of them in the moſt horrible of diſeaſes; for at this time I myſelf cannot bring one proof of the ſucceſs. But I would not have any one diſcouraged from the purſuit of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Heaven opens to us gradually its favors: the <hi>loadſtone</hi> was for ages a meer matter of ignorant amaze at its attractive qualities: <hi>mercury</hi> was a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed poiſon, and the terror of phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians: we now wonder at the powers of electricity, and are ſtill but partially acquainted with its uſes: the toad, the object of horror even in the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened times, is found to be perfectly innocent; it has certainly contributed to the eaſe (and as has been ſaid to the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:1199500103:364"/>cure) of the unhappy cancered; let the following facts ſpeak for themſelves; they come from perſons of undoubted veracity, and will ſufficiently eſtabliſh the truth of the beneficent qualities of this animal.</p>
            <p>The firſt paper relating to it is very ingeniouſly draw up by Mr. <hi>Pitfield,</hi> for the information of Doctor <hi>Littleton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> (now happy) who immediately honored me with the copy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exon, Aug.</hi> 29, 1768.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Your lordſhip muſt have taken notice of a paragraph in the papers, with regard to the application of toads to a cancered breaſt. A pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of mine has ſent to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood of <hi>Hungerford,</hi> and brought down the very woman on whom the cure was done. I have, with all the attention I am capable of, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the operation for eighteen or twenty days, and am ſurprized at the phaenomenon. I am in no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of any great ſervice from the application: the age, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thoroughly cancerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the perſon, being uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable barriers to it. How an ail of that kind, abſolutely local, in an otherwiſe ſound habit, and of a
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:1199500103:365"/>likely age, might be relieved, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay. But as to the operation, thus much I can aſſert, that there is neither pain nor nauſeouſneſs in it. The animal is put into a linen bag, all but its head, and that is held to the part. It has generally inſtantly laid hold of the fouleſt part of the ſore, and ſucked with greedineſs until it dropped off dead. It has frequently happened that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has ſwolen immenſely, and from its agonies appeared to be in great pain. I have weighed them for ſeveral days together, before and after the application, and found their increaſe of weight, in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees, from a drachm to near an ounce. They frequently ſweat exceedingly, and turn quite pale: ſometimes they diſgorge, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and become lively again. I think the whole ſcene is ſurpriſing, and a very remarkable piece of natural hiſtory. From the conſtant inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiveneſs which I have obſerved in them, I almoſt queſtion the truth of their poiſonous ſpitting. Many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here expect no great good from the application of toads to cancers; and where the diſorder is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely local, none is to be expected;
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:1199500103:366"/>where it is, and ſeated in any part, not to be well come at for extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I think it is hardly to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, but that the having it ſucked clean as often as you pleaſe, muſt give great relief. Every body knows, that dogs licking of ſores cures them, which is, I ſuppoſe, chiefly by keeping them clean. If there is any credit to be given to hiſtory, poiſons have been ſucked out, —<hi>Pallentia Vulnera lambit Ore Venera trahens.</hi> are the words of <hi>Lucan</hi> on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: if the people to whom theſe words are applied, did their cure by immediately following the injection of the poiſon, the local confinement of another poiſon brings the caſe to a great degree of ſimilarity.</p>
               <p>I hope I have not tired your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with my long tale, as it is a true one, and in my apprehenſion a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous piece of natural hiſtory, I could not forbear communicating it to you. I own I thought the ſtory in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to be an invention, and when I
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:1199500103:367"/>conſidered the inſtinctive principle in all animals of ſelf preſervation, I was confirmed in my diſbelief; but what I have related I ſaw, and all theory muſt yield to fact. It is only the <hi>Rubeta,</hi> the land toad, which has the property of ſucking; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find any the leſt mention of the property in any one of the old naturaliſts. My patient can bear to have but one applied in twenty-four hours: the woman who was cured had them on day and night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion, for five weeks. Their time of hanging at the breaſt has been from one to ſix hours.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The other account is of a woman now under the experiment, which I give, as delivered to me from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted authority. If the event is proſperous, an early opportunity ſhall be taken of informing the public of it in ſome of the news-papers, with all circumſtances of place, name, &amp;c. which at preſent it is needleſs to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>About ſix years ago a poor woman received a cruſh on her breaſt by the fall of a pail; a cancerous complaint was the reſult.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:1199500103:368"/>Laſt year her diſorder increaſed to an alarming degree; ſhe had five wounds on her breaſts, one exceeding large, from which fragments of bone worked out, giving her vaſt pain; and at the ſame time there was a great diſcharge of thin yellow mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſhe was likewiſe reduced to a meer ſkeleton.</p>
            <p>All her left ſide and ſtomach was much ſwelled; her fingers doughy and diſcolored.</p>
            <p>On the 25th of <hi>September,</hi> 1768, the firſt toad was applied; between that and the 29th ſhe uſed ſeven, and had that night better reſt. She ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with greater eaſe, for before that time there was ſome appearance of humor in her neck, and a difficulty of getting any thing down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 16th, the patient better. It was thought proper as winter was coming on, and of courſe it would be very difficult to procure a number of toads, to apply more at a time, ſo three were put on at once. the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the arm abated, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's reſt was good.</p>
            <p>During theſe tryals ſhe took an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of <hi>Water Parſnep</hi> with <hi>Pulvis Cornacchini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:1199500103:369"/>
               <hi>December</hi> 18th, continued to look ill, but finds herſelf better: two of the wounds were now healed.</p>
            <p>She was always moſt eaſy when the toads were ſucking, of which ſhe kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vaſt numbers in the operation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 1769. The laſt account that was received, informing that the patient was better.</p>
            <p>The remarks made on the animals, are theſe: Some toads died very ſoon after they had ſucked; others lived about a quarter of an hour, but ſome lived much longer: for example, one that was applied about ſeven o'clock ſucked till ten, and died as ſoon as it was taken from the breaſt; another that immediately ſucceeded continued till three o'clock, but dropped dead from the wound, each ſwelled exceedingly, and turned of a pale color.</p>
            <p>Theſe toads did not ſeem to ſuck greedily, and would often turn their heads away; but during the time of ſucking were heard to ſmack their lips like a young child.</p>
            <p>As thoſe reptiles are apt by their ſtruggles to get out of the bag, the open end ought to be made with an open hem, that the ſtring may run the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:1199500103:370"/>more readily, and faſten tightly about the neck.</p>
            <p>It would be improper to quit the ſubject without mentioning the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of this ſtrange diſcovery, which was owing to a woman near <hi>Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> who labored under a cancerous complaint in her breaſt, which had long baffled all applications.</p>
            <p>The account ſhe gives of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which ſhe came by her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is very ſingular, and I may ſay apocryphal. She ſays of herſelf, that in the height of her diſorder ſhe went to ſome church where there was a vaſt crowd: on going into a pew, ſhe was accoſted by a ſtrange clergyman, who, after expreſſing compaſſion for her ſituation, told her that if ſhe would make ſuch an application of living toads <note n="*" place="bottom">I have been told that ſhe not only made uſe of living toads, but permitted the dead ones to remain at her breaſt, by way of cataplaſms, for ſome weeks.</note> as abovementioned, ſhe would be well.</p>
            <p>This dark ſtory is all we can collect relating to the affair. It is our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that ſhe ſtumbled upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery by accident, and that having ſet up for a cancer doctreſs, ſhe thought it neceſſary to amuſe the world with
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:1199500103:371"/>this myſterious relation <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Valentine Greatraks,</hi> who about the year 1664, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded himſelf that he could cure diſeaſes, by ſtroking them out of the parts affected with his hand; and the famous <hi>Bridget Boſtock,</hi> of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> who worked cures by virtue of her faſting ſpittle, both came by their art in a manner ſupernatural, but by <hi>faith many were made whole.</hi>
               </note> For it ſeems very unaccountable, that this unknown gentleman ſhould expreſs ſo much tenderneſs for this ſingle ſufferer, and not feel any for the many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands that daily languiſh under this terrible diſorder: would he not have made uſe of this invaluable noſtrum for his own emolument, or at leſt, by ſome other means have found a method of making it public for the good of mankind.</p>
            <p>Here I take leave of the ſubject, which I could not do without expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my doubts, as to the method of the woman's obtaining her informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but in reſpect to the authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of this new-diſcovered property of the toad, facts eſtabliſh it beyond diſpute. Let the humane wiſh for ſpeedy proofs of the efficacy; and for the ſatisfaction of the world, let thoſe who are capable of giving indiſputable proofs of the ſucceſs, take the earlieſt opportunity of making the public ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſo intereſting an affair.</p>
