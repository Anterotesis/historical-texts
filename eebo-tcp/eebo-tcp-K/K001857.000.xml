            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> HAVE frequently taken notice of the <hi>Medicine Cheſts</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">In furniſhing Medicine Cheſts, particular regard muſt be had to the different climates; and to the diſorders that are moſt prevalent in thoſe countries.—The ſame in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Cheſts.—Each perſon, knowing their own conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will endeavour to accomodate themſelves accordingly.</note> in the cabinet-ſhops, ſome containing <hi>ſix</hi> bottles, ſome <hi>nine,</hi> and ſome <hi>twelve;</hi> others larger, with drawers to hold different Medicines; which are extremely convenient in any exigency, and would be more univerſally made uſe of, if a ſimple and ſafe plan could be adopted: and I think it is a pity no perſon has ever given a hint how to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe ſmall ones. There are frequently adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed large Cheſts, the plan of which I do not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether approve of; becauſe, when a perſons buys one, and takes it many miles in the country, and is out of the ſeveral Medicines, he is obliged to ſend up to the firſt proprietor, otherwiſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the ſame; therefore all Medicines in the Cheſts ſhould bear the title of the <hi>London Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0165700600:5"/>as directed by the College of Phyſicians, unleſs there may be ſomething added more efficacious; and then the Recipe ſhould be given, or ſay where it is taken from.—I do not mean to enter largely on the Diſpenſatory, as thoſe have done; but only to endeavour at a ſcheme for furniſhing ſmall ones, from 1 <hi>l.</hi> 1 <hi>s.</hi> to about 4 <hi>l.</hi> 4 <hi>s.</hi> each, firſt coſt; (perſons ſuiting their own ſtations;) to be ready at any time when any ſudden illneſs ſhould ſeize any of the family.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity of ſuch a plan is too obvious, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we conſider the many accidents human nature is ſubject to; in which, without immediate help, we are either loſt, or kept in great pain; which would be in a great meaſure prevented, if maſters or miſtreſſes of families would keep a ſmall Cheſt by them; and particularly thoſe who reſide in a country village, often many miles from a town where an Apothecary is to be met with.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to ſelect ſuch Medicines as I think neceſſary, and chooſe thoſe chiefly which the the College of Phyſicians have ordered the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries to keep in their ſhops; that, by aſking for the Medicines by their names, you will always have the right, if you deal with a perſon of credit.— I will not recommend any Medicine where there may be danger in it, without pointing it out likwiſe. Electuaries, on account they are ſo diſagreeable to take, I leave out; as I can always ſubſtitute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more agreeable in a liquid; and, as my deſign is to curtail Phyſic, I ſhall chiefly confine myſelf to thoſe Medicines that lie in a ſmall compaſs, whoſe virtues I have often ſo happily experienced.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0165700600:6"/>
            <p>At my firſt writing of this, I had no thoughts of offering my ſervice to the public, to furniſh thoſe ſmall Cheſts; but, if any perſon is deſirous of my ſervice, I will very readily give my advice, and explain more particularly the Recipes, and Nature of the Medicines, and take care they ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the beſt of them: And, as I am the firſt who has endeavoured to make theſe ſmall Cheſts univerſal, without any reſerve; I hope, at leaſt, I may meet with candour; and any hints that will improve the whole will be gratefully received, By</p>

            <p>I HAVE, in the courſe of this work, exceeded the bounds I, at firſt, intended; and have taken notice of ſeveral Medicines, which are uſeful on particular occaſions, (and which the public may be furniſhed with, if they think proper) though not abſolutely neceſſary to be kept in every houſe. The ſmall Cheſts, with a few bottles, will ever be found the moſt ſerviceable; the uſe of which I moſt ſtrongly plead for, without intereſt; as I am intirely againſt any ſecret noſtrums being put in; and hope no one will encourage any ſuch practices.</p>

            <p>As Medicine Cheſts are made of different ſizes, each perſon may adopt which they pleaſe: the firſt, nine, or twelve, I particularly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to every family. Thoſe who keep the whole will have a very good Apothecary's ſhop; and a Phyſician or Apothecary may make a good Medicine up quickly, to ſuit any exigency.

            <div type="recipe">
               <head>ELIXIR PAREGORIC.</head>
               <p>This excellent Elixir was invented by Le Mort, a French Surgeon, and was called the Elixir Aſthmatic. It is a Medicine of great efficacy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0165700600:11"/>in freſh Colds or Coughs, and may be given to children in the Chin-Cough, commonly called the Whooping-Cough. Doſe, a tea-ſpoonful, (not more) going to bed. Grown people may take more, up to a tea-ſpoonful and a half. It is a gentle opiate.</p>
               <argument>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0165700600:10"/>
                  <p>N. B. Perſons who are ſubject to a bad Cough, of long ſtanding, and Shortneſs of Breath, muſt take care not to meddle with it, an account of the Opium in it, which would almoſt choak them. When a perſon has got a Cold, they ſhould put on a double night-cap, and a woollen ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round their neck. Children are frequently troubled with a Cough that proceeds from eating traſh, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions tough phlegm to be lodged in the ſtomach: in that caſe, or where it is a Whooping-Cough, a gentle vomit of Ipecacoanha wine, (doſe, two drams, in any pleaſant liquor, for a child of ſix years old) may be given; or a gentle purge; as, Take manna, half an ounce; diſſolve it in a cup of tea; and add Tincture of Jalap, one tea-ſpoonful: but, where Worms are ſuſpected, a doſe of Baſilicon Powder muſt be given.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, in taking of Medicines, to begin with a ſmall doſe, and ſo increaſe or diminiſh as you find them operate: by this you will diſcover what is commonly called the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. In Fevers this ſhould be given very ſparingly, as it will rather increaſe the heat.</p>

               <head>BALSAM ANODYNE.</head>
               <p>This is a valuable compoſition. It cures freſh Aches and Pains, ariſing from Colds, almoſt to a wonder. Thoſe who are troubled with the Gout, or Rheumatiſm, muſt uſe Opodeldoc.</p>
               <p>It likewiſe cures the Tooth and Head-Ach, and is the baſis of thoſe Tinctures advertiſed. For Outward Pains, rub half an ounce well in before the fire, and wear a flannel. For Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Cholics, or Gravelly Complaints, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed. Doſe, twenty drops to ſixty, for a grown perſon. This is a ſtronger Opiate than the former.</p>

               <head>SOOT DROPS, OR, TINCTURE OF SOOT.</head>
               <p>Where children are theſe Drops ſhould always be at hand; there is not any Medicine of ſo great efficacy as this is in bringing people out of Fits, when properly applied. I have known a grown perſon ſeized with Fits, which before uſed to hold an hour, and could not be brought to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by any of thoſe cruel, mis-judged methods very often made uſe of by ſtrangers, as forcing open the hands, pinching, burning, &amp;c. which is wrong. My method was, to pour a pap-ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of theſe Drops down the Patient's throat by itſelf, and almoſt immediately they would reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; if not, I gave the ſecond, which ſeldom failed; indeed, I never knew it to fail. It is a ſafe Medicine for children from one to four years old: I lower it for them by mixing two or three parts water with it, as one tea-ſpoonful of Drops and three of water; when children either purge or vomit, the danger is over: rubbing their limbs and ſoles of the feet is good. The beſt preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt Fits is an Iſſue, and purge off the acids with Magneſia and Rhubarb. In Lethargy Fits, a ſtrong vomit muſt be forced down, as the Wine of Antimony, the Sal Vitriol; theſe two laſt Medicines require judgement.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0165700600:34"/>juices. They were formerly conſidered as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines of much greater importance than they are thought to be at preſent.

As multitudes of diſtilled waters have been compounded from materials unfit to give any virtue over the helm, ſo numbers of Syrups have been prepared of ingredients which, in this form, cannot be taken in ſufficient doſes to exert their virtues; for two-thirds of a Syrup conſiſt of ſugar, and greateſt part of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing third is an aqueous fluid. Syrups are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent chiefly regarded as convenient vehicles for Medicines of greater efficacy, and made uſe of for ſweetening Draughts and Juleps; for reducing the lighter Powders into Boluſes, Pills, or Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries; and other like purpoſes.
