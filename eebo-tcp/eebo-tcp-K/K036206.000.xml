            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT may not be improper to tell an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader ſome Circumſtances of this Play. The Character of <hi>AEMILIA,</hi> conſequently her Scenes with <hi>MERCOUR,</hi> is wholly new. The Fable, excepting ſome Alterations, which ſeemed neceſſary, with regard to the Difference of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage, is taken from a Comedy publiſhed laſt Year by Madame <hi>Grafigny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me be permitted to take this Opportunity of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my beſt Thanks to the ſeveral Performers, for the Chearfulneſs, with which they went through the Fatigue of Rehearſing and Acting. The Public is the beſt Judge of their Merit, and its Favour the beſt Proof of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> is intitled to my ſincereſt Gratitude, for his Performance as an Actor, and for his Punctuality, as a Manager; but his Aſſiſtance in a thouſand Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his ſtrong good Senſe, with that Spirit of Theatrical Criticiſm, which is his peculiar natural Genius, give him a Right to a great Share of that Applauſe, with which this Play was received.

            <byline>Written by <hi>Colley Cibber,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </byline>
            <byline>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Pritchard.</hi>
            </byline>
            <lg>
               <l>OF all the various Wonders Wit can do,</l>
               <l>(Whether to pleaſe the Many, or the Few)</l>
               <l>None charms an Audience—like a Stroke, that's new.</l>
               <l>Now this choice Secret found, I dare engage,</l>
               <l>Has brought our ſolemn Champion to the Stage,</l>
               <l>As if, to reach this Merit, were no more,</l>
               <l>Than juſt to write—as none e'er wrote before.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Why here's a Play now—of what Kind to call it</l>
               <l>I know no more than—of what will befal it—</l>
               <l>Whether the <hi>Critics</hi> Praiſe—or bolder <hi>Bucks</hi> ſhall maul it;</l>
               <l>In <hi>France</hi> 'twas Comedy; but here 'tis Tragic!</l>
               <l>And all by dint of pure poetic Magic—</l>
               <l>Miſtake me not, I don't by this aver;</l>
               <l>That <hi>ev'ry</hi> Poet is a Conjurer;</l>
               <l>Ours is all Sentiment, blank Verſe, and Virtue,</l>
               <l>Diſtreſs—But yet no Bloodſhed to divert ye.</l>
               <l>Such Plays in <hi>France</hi> perhaps may cut a Figure;</l>
               <l>But to our Critics here they're mere <hi>Soup-meagre;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Tho' there they never ſtain their Stage with Blood;</l>
               <l>Yet <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stomachs love ſubſtantial Food.</l>
               <l>Give us! the Lightning's Blaze, the Thunder's Roll!</l>
               <l>The pointed Dagger, and the pois'ning Bowl!</l>
               <l>Let Drums and Trumpets Clangor ſwell the Scene,</l>
               <l>Till the gor'd Battle bleed in ev'ry Vein.</l>
               <l>We love the Muſes animating Spark,</l>
               <l>Till Gods meet Gods and juſtle in the Dark!</l>
               <l>This now did ſomething in the Days of Yore,</l>
               <l>When Lungs heroic made the Galleries roar.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As for our Bard, the fatal Die is thrown,</l>
               <l>And now the Queſtion is—What ſays the Town,</l>
               <l>Has he thrown in, or is the Dupe undone?</l>
               <l>Yet on your Juſtice boldly he relied,</l>
               <l>No Party form'd, no partial Friendſhip tried.</l>
               <l>Tho' Love of Praiſe his inmoſt Soul inflame,</l>
               <l>All feign'd, or forc'd Applauſe he dares diſclaim,</l>
               <l>Your Candour—no—Your Judgment be his Fame.</l>
