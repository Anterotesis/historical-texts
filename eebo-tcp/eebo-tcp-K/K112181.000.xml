            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Years paſt, and the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them to this Time, <pb facs="tcp:0544000400:3"/> do

            <p>I know how delicate a Taſte your Lordſhip has; that you have
adorned your Mind both with Univerſity and Polite Learning; ſo that were I
not entirely ſatisfied that the Thoughts in them are not common, (and were
they not my Father's, I <pb facs="tcp:0544000400:4"/> ſhould ſay) that they are writ in the
ſmooth Stile of a Courtier, with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Air of a Gentleman, and with
the Strength of a Man of Letters, I ſhou'd not have preſum'd to have
inſcrib'd your Lordſhip's Name before them.</p>
            <p>How he was qualified to write theſe Eſſays, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face

which laſted about Thirty Years, he laid out his Hours between Books, Men of

            <p>There are ſome of them indeed that ſeem not to have paſs'd
his laſt Hands, which therefore are not ſo correct as they would have been,
had he liv'd to have finiſh'd them. But when I conſider, that the firſt

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Think it neceſſary to give ſome Account of the Author of
the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Eſſays, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Eſſays themſelves; the
rather, becauſe being Poſthumous Works, the Genuineſs of them might be
otherwiſe doubted.</p>
            <p>As for the Author, Sir <hi>Richard Bulſtrode,</hi> he was the
Son of <hi>Edward Bulſtrode</hi> of the <hi>Inner-Temple,</hi>
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> whoſe Reports are extant; he came abroad into the World
well ſtock'd with Univerſity Learning; was bred at the
<hi>Inner-Temple,</hi> call'd to the Bar, and practis'd as a Barriſter, 'till
the Civil Wars breaking out, put a Stop to the Current of the Law; and 
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0544000400:9"/> being then a young Man, and of an active Spirit, betook
himſelf to the Army, and was of the Royal Side; where he behaved himſelf
ſo well, that in a little time he was made Adjutant-General to the Army of
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. After the Return of the Royal Family, he had
a Place at Court; ſome time after he was appointed to be at the Court of
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> as Reſident from King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; on
whoſe Death he was made Envoy by King <hi>James</hi> the Second to the ſame
Court, his whole Miniſtry there being about thirty Years; during which Time
he held Correſpondence with moſt of the Courts of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi>
(as I find by his Letters made up into Annals, which I have by me.)</p>
            <p>When his Royal Maſter retir'd to <hi>France,</hi> he went after
him, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Fortune, and lived there in Retirement about
twenty Years; during which Time he had <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0544000400:10"/> Opportunity to
compoſe the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eſſays, which were the Reſult of his own
Experience.</p>
            <p>He had been a diligent Obſerver of Mankind, through a long
Series of Time, having lived to an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and one; had the Experience of
Courts, the Converſation of Men of the firſt Quality, Generals, and Men of
Polite Learning: And having had great Variety of Fortune himſelf, was beſt
able to inform Mankind what is proper to be done in thoſe ſeveral Parts of
Life, in which he had been exerciſed.</p>
            <p>He looked back upon Life, after many Years enjoying it, with a
truer View, than Men uſually do forward; for we look through a magnifying
Glaſs at Things to come, and think them much bigger, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than
in Truth we find them. The Proſpect of <hi>Canaan</hi> from Mount
<hi>Nebo,</hi> was more raviſhing even to <hi>Moſes,</hi> than the
Enjoyment of it <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0544000400:11"/> was afterwards to the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> or would have been to himſelf. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> could
not have ſpoke ſo feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Vanity of the Pleaſures of this Life,
had he not taken a full Draught of them. The Freedom of the Author's
Converſation, in his younger Years, (being a Man of a warm Temper, a great
deal of Wit and Generoſity) having kept what we call the beſt Company, gave
him an Opportunity of looking back on the Miſcarriages, which young Gentlemen
are ſubject to, with uſeful Reflections and Remarks, and of ſpeaking more
juſtly of thoſe Errors, than Cloſet Moraliſts uſually do.</p>
            <p>The Author would have ſent me the following Eſſays, to have
pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in his Life-Time, had not the War between <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France</hi> hinder'd it; but dying before that ended, he gave Directions to
his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſend them to me by the firſt <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0544000400:12"/> Opportunity;
which ſhe accordingly did, being all of his own Hand Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>So much for the Author.</p>
            <p>As to the Eſſays themſelves:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">I. Eſſay of Company and
Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</note>That of Company and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhews him to have
read Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind very throughly.</p>
            <p>The Caution of chuſing ones Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, when to ſpeak, and when
not, when to break a Jeſt, and when not, is very fit for all young Gentlemen
to know; his ſhort, but ſmart Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on obſcene Diſcourſes, is a
Proof of his Knowledge of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Tongue.</p>
            <p>He Inveighs againſt the Sin of ſcoffing at Religion and
profane Swearing, with great Sharpneſs and a moving Sorrow. When a good Man
hears his Friend traduc'd, he defends him if he has Opportunity, or is in Pain
for want of it: Much more ſhould every Chriſtian be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, when he
hears that Name <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0544000400:13"/> prophaned, which ought not to be mentioned
without Reverence.</p>
            <p>Nor does Detraction and Flattery eſcape a juſt Cenſure, tho'
he lived and dy'd in a Court.</p>
            <p>His Rules of Converſation, with Superiors, Equals and Inferiors,
are well weighed and conſider'd. As moſt Men are free and open at Meals,
the Account he gives of his Witty Maſter King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, at
his private Suppers, with ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Perſons, Men of Wit, is very
entertaining.</p>
            <p>One General Rule he lays down, that ſhould go through all the
Parts of Converſation, and that is Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is a Virtue too ſeldom
pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. He avoids the Pedantry and Motoſeneſs of ſevere
<hi>Cynicks</hi>; and tho' he highly commends pleaſant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, Wit,
Muſick, and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Tales; yet he wiſely cautions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Picquant
Jeſts, which often breed Quarrels; and in all theſe <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0544000400:14"/>
Freedoms, has let nothing ſlip from him, that is contrary to the Rules of
good <hi>Ethicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mirth thus guarded with Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, makes the Cup of Life go down
pleaſantly, and leaves no Stain behind it, to wound the Conſcience. He has
truly ſaid, that ſome Perſons and Caſes are privileg'd from Jeſts. As
Mens Deformity, Meanneſs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals, Poverty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
puts me in Mind of a Gentleman, whoſe Wit lay only in ridiculing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and
having a poor Man that work'd for him, (whoſe Shape was not deformed) would
be often tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him he would give him five Pounds to ſit for his Picture.
The Man thought 'twas in Deriſion, would never be brought to it, but gave him
this ſharp Anſwer, <hi>That he would give five Pounds to laugh at a poor
Man, but would not give him a Shilling to buy him a Dinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0544000400:15"/>Which Gentleman, tho' he had then about two
thouſand Pounds a Year, yet afterwards lived to want a Shilling to buy
himſelf a Dinner.</p>
            <p>His Account of Converſation with well choſen Friends is very
delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and inſtructive. I know nothing of this World comparable to the
Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Converſation, with wiſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ingenious Friends,
except in the Conſciouſneſs of doing our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the moſt High, and
the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we ſtand in, and the Peace of Mind, (I had almoſt ſaid
Rapture) that reſults from thence.</p>
            <p>His Advice to Women, as to their Converſation with Men, is fit
for all Ladies to know; and ſo it is for Men, that intend Chaſtity, not to
be too Converſant with pretty Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for 'tis ill making Gun-Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a
Smith's Shop.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">II. Eſſay of Solitarineſs and
Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>His Thoughts of Retirement are very philoſophical, juſt,
and of great Weight; and the prudent, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0544000400:16"/>
Rules he gives therein, of great Uſe. He writes very feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on that
Subject, as what he found by Experience; the Art of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and the

which he appears to have been a perfect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and to have given proper

to be ſpent in publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and the Remainder in Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and
uſeful Reflections for the Benefit of Mankind. If he has car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd Retirement
to greater Heights, than Men attached to the World can allow; it ſhould be
conſider'd, that when one is writing on a Pleaſure, at a time when one
enjoys it, it's hard to keep within the Bounds of moderate Expreſſions. His
lofty Strains, nevertheleſs tho' true, may not appear ſo to them who

            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0544000400:17"/>To ſpeak freely of this Matter, I think
theſe Rules touching Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be obſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To have ſuch a competent Fortune, as may
anſwer all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Life, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Employment are
quitted. For to be pinched in the Materials of Life, in old Age, is a
miſerable State, eſpecially to a generous Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To have the Mind fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſuch
Knowledge, while the Life was active, as may ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently employ it, when
contemplative.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To have ones Paſſions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from the
World, and to have little or no Thirſt after it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To conſecrate the latter Part of Life to the
more intenſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, in Contemplation and Devotion, and in
Benefactions to the Neceſſitous; and to endeavour to produce ſome Fruit,
for the good of the Publick, for the preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Age.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0544000400:18"/>More particularly; I think that a Retirement
to a convenient Houſe and pleaſant Gardens, near a Church, where daily
Devotions may be had; a good Library, a near Friend, and the Exerciſe of
Philoſophical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with Beneficence to the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is the ſafeſt
and beſt Retirement for a wiſe Man. Theſe Things will fill up the Space
of Life, with Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Pleaſure.</p>

into their Stile, and conform to their way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. And thus the

            <p>The Truth is, the wonderful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of ſpreading the Goſpel, by

Eſſay of Contentment under adverſe Fortune, and the many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Examples
he brings of great Men in Adverſity, and the weighty Reaſons he gives for a
quiet Submiſſion to the divine Providence in Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are ſo genuine
and natural, that one may eaſily ſee they flow from a Mind exerciſed by
long Trial in that Condition. The afflicted of any ſort, may here draw Waters
of Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to give Peace and Reſt to their Minds.</p>
            <p>His Arguments for Contentment under Afflictions, are very apt to
ſoften the Paſſions, and allay the Fury which Men generally exerciſe
under that State, and reduce the Mind to a wiſe and ſober Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to
the Will of God. He has writ in none of his Eſſays any thing 
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0544000400:22"/> above the Nature of a brave and a good Man, and
particularly on this Subject; he ſeems rather to have vented the Dictates of
his own Mind, under the various States of Life, through which he had paſs'd,
than offer at Conjectures which he never felt. He that ſets a Pattern above
humane Life, may pleaſe the Fancy, but will never ſatisfie the Judgment of
the Reader. In giving Rules for the Conduct of humane Life, in the various
Events of it, we ſhould rather write like Divines and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers than
Poets. His Definition of Good and Evil, is more inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive than that of
<hi>Zeno,</hi> or any of the Stoicks; for he calls that Good which makes a Man
the better, and that Evil which makes one the worſe, be that Condition rich

Sciences, without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, is a Truth ſelf-evident: For all the
Knowledge of this World is calculated only for the Meridian of this Life, and
reaches no farther; but the Knowledge of God reaches to Eternity. And as
Travellers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to their own Country, give <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0544000400:24"/> a
pleaſant Relation of things curious, which they have met with in Foreign
Parts; ſo the Knowledge we acquire, and Obſervations we make of God's moral
Government of this World, of the Revolution of States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and of the
natural Production of his admirable Works, may ſerve us to entertain even
Angels in the Kingdom of Heaven. For tho' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels excel us in Wiſdom, Power,
and the Knowledge of ſome things; yet their Wiſdom, Power and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
are circumſcribed; for none of theſe Qualities are infinite but in God;
they are ignorant of ſome Things: Omniſcience is the Attribute only of the
moſt High: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Man in its full Latitude, they did not know.
Holy Writ tells us, that Angels were deſirous to look into it, and that they
were inform'd of it by the Church. But be that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; By the Study and
Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the divine Operations, of God's natural Government of the 
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0544000400:25"/> World, we arrive at the Knowledge of God himſelf; for
his Majeſty is known by his Works, the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of which brings
infinite Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to them who delight therein.</p>
            <p>As for Atheiſm, holy Writ tells us, 'twas the Fool <hi>that
ſaid in his Heart there was no God.</hi> And indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Fool could
have thought or ſaid ſo, and he had only the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſaying it in his
Heart, but not the Impudence to expreſs in it Words: Surely as he that ſees
a fine Houſe, muſt conclude an ingenious Artiſt contrived it, and ſome
Perſon muſt build it; for that Stones and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber cannot erect themſelves
into a regular Building, without ſome skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Builder; ſo he that looks on
the Frame of this World, muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge an infinite wiſe God, that made

Magiſtrate where they reſide, the Author hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſtly obſerved,
which ought to be a Leſſon to all Princes and Magiſtrates, to act with
great Caution, that their bad <pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:0544000400:37"/> Example may not lead the
common People, or thoſe of a common Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, into Vices. <hi>Regis
ad exemplum totus componitur Orbis.</hi> And here I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſay a Word of
the Benefit of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, which both Foreigners that live
here, and Natives, have great Reaſon to be thankful to Providence for. The
Laws of <hi>England</hi> ſecure every Man's Property and Liberty, no Man
forfeits either, but by the Tranſgreſſion of ſome known poſitive Law.
The Magiſtrate cannot commit any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Priſon, without a Breach of
the Laws; if he does, he is anſwerable for it to the Party injured. The Judge
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines not according to Arbitrary Power, but according to known and
ſtated Rules. But this Subject hath been ſo much ſpoken of, that I think
it not neceſſary to ſay any more thereon.</p>

               <note place="margin">XV. Eſſay of old Age.</note>As no Man
writes more feelingly of Afflictions, than he who gives his Thoughts a Vent
under that Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo no Man can write ſo truly of the Circumſtances
of old Age, as he <pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:0544000400:38"/> that keeps his Underſtanding well to
an hundred, the which the Author did, as appears by his Eſſays, ſome of
which were writ at near that Age.</p>
            <p>The Reſpect he challenges, as due to old Age eſpecially, when
furniſh'd with Wiſdom and Knowledge; and the Conſideration of good
Services done to the Publick, is a Tribute, that I think ought not to be deny'd
it. But nothing can make the Mind of an old Man more calm and ſedate, more
bright and ſhining, than a Retroſpect of a long Life well ſpent, in a
zealous promoting the Honour of God, and the Good and Welfare of Mankind; for
every Man's Life is to be eſtimated by its Uſefulneſs. Integrity of Mind,
a love of Truth in the Soul, and the Conſciouſneſs of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all we can,
for our moſt munificent Benefactor, to whom we are riding poſt in old Age,
makes that Scene of Life full of Joy and Pleaſure. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was full
of Rapture, when he was going off the Stage of Life, tho' by a violent Death.
But few Courtiers come within <pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:0544000400:39"/> this Character; for to
them generally Falſhood and Deceit are as natural, as bowing and cringing;
and as for Truth, it hath no Place in their Souls. They join themſelves to a
Party, that they may mount up to be the Head of it, with no other View, but to
betray and deſtroy it, and to aggrandize themſelves thereby. Oh!

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN God created <hi>Adam,</hi> who the firſt Moment was a
perfect Man, yet he was not made to be entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached, and to live
inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant of his Kind; for tho' he had nothing in Proſpect but Plenty,
Pleaſure, Innocence, and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and by the Dignity of his Nature was
ſet above the Society of meer Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, yet God ſaw his Being imperfect
without a Helper, and that his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0544000400:41"/> was not
compleat whilſt he remain'd Solitary; wherefore God miraculouſly reliev'd
him, by dividing him, to unite him, and made one Part of him a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for
the other, to maintain his Reaſon with a more equal Converſe; for which End
God ordain'd Speech, from whence we derive all the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Society, and
without which Men would have been uſeleſs to each other. For by this we
poſſeſs the moſt valuable worldly Bleſſings, Friendſhip and
Society, which are eſteem'd amongſt the Pleaſures of the firſt
Magnitude, the Comfort of Life depending upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, Humane Society
being like the working of a Arch-Stone, where all would fall to the Ground if
one Peice did not ſuſtain another; and yet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is ſo dangerous, and
Speech ſo lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be deprav'd, that what was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our Advantage
is become the Source of all our Misfortunes. For Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin came firſt out
of the Mouth by Speaking, before it entred hers by Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore the
due Management of that Member may juſtly be reputed one of the greateſt
Myſteries of Wiſdom and Virtue, ſince we find to our Sorrow, the firſt
Uſe <hi>Eve</hi> made of her Tongue was to talk with the Tempter, and from 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0544000400:42"/> that Diſcourſe to tempt <hi>Adam,</hi> who was no
ſooner fallen, but he makes a frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Excuſe leſs able to cover his
Sin than the Fig-Leaves his Nakedneſs; And this Viciouſneſs of the Tongue
hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the Infancy of the World even to this Day, for amongſt
our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Depravations there are none more Notorious than that of Speech;
For we do not only fall by the Slipperineſs of our Tongues, but we
deliberately train them to Miſchief, and what was firſt intended for the
Benefit of Humane Society, is now become the great Diſturber of it, we living
in an Age wherein we count it a part of our Birth-right to let looſe our
Tongues, and to uſe the Spur where we ſhould hold the Bridle; whereby
Converſation is generally Corrupted, and he that Converſes has almoſt as
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Snares as Companions, there being ſcarce any ſingle Man, but by his
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, Example, or Behaviour, does recommend to us, or imprint in us,
or by a kind of Contagion inſenſibly infect us with ſome Vice or other;
ſo that Converſation, which was intended to cultivate our Minds and
civilize the World, hath turn'd it almoſt to a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. Upon this
Account ſome Men will take a Pett at Mankind, and walk <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0544000400:43"/>
into the Deſarts to avoid Company, when it is more prudential to ſtand
their Ground, and to fence againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies that may happen; and
if they fear bad Company they ſhould keep cloſe to Men of Virtue, and
ſtand care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon their Guard; it being more reaſonable to be
converſable for the ſake of the Good, than to fly from every Mortal for
fear of meeting with bad People: If every Man were poſſeſt with this
Shineſs, not only States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but even Humane Nature would be
deſtroy'd; for to what end was Speech given to Man, if it were not for
Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of each other? And muſt we quit our Station, and turn Savage
by our ſelves, and ſuffer no Company, for fear of Bad? This is to take
Things by the wrong Handle, for nothing but our own Miſcarriages ought to
affect us, and not thoſe of other People.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that all Mens Bodies are naturally of the ſame Clay,
the difference of Education only is the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Hand that forms them into
Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Honour or Diſhonour; there being no humane Means more
effectual towards ripening and ſharpning Mens Intellects, giving them an edge
and quickneſs for Converſation, than good <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0544000400:44"/> Education,
becauſe it takes them in that Age wherein their Faculties are, as their
Joints, pliable and tractable, and ſo capable of being by Exerciſe
impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into great Degrees of Strength, Activity and Ability: So that one of
the greateſt Bleſſings which Man can receive at God's Hands, is the
favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bleſſing of good Education, which poliſhes and purifies
Nature as one would do a precious Stone wholly defiled with Earth; and this
makes Men become like Angels, when without it the beſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would ſtill
dwell in Brutiſhneſs. Now ſince after good Education, it is a great Part
of Wiſdom as well as Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to learn what is convenient, and to take the
true height of our Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who converſing with our Minds, caſt upon
them either Graces or Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; It will therefore be highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for young Gentlemen, who are tender of their Honour and Credit, to be more than
ordinarily careful of being too venturous of any Company, and to be very
curious in taking an exact Survey with what Perſons they may ſafely and
decently Converſe, and how they ought to Behave themſelves therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0544000400:45"/>It is uſual with Phyſicians, in infectious
Times, to forbid moſt ſtrictly the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Exceſſes and Exorbitances
of Diet, as apt to breed any Diſtemper, becauſe every ſmall Accident of
that Kind (thro' the Malignity of the Air) is then likely to turn into the
Plague: So now that Atheiſm and Profaneneſs are rife in the World, and
ſpread much, and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery is ſo predominant and contagious, that we
daily ſee many Men of virtuous Diſpoſitions and good Inclinations, (which
would have grown to Abilities) to be by ill Company moſt perniciouſly
Corrupted; ſome Cautions herein ſeem therefore highly neceſſary: For as
if we Breath in an infectious Air we ſhall ſuck in Diſeaſes, ſo if we
live in bad Company we ſhall ſoon add to their Number, and learn their
Vices and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more dangerous for young Gentlemen than to
miſtake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Choice of their Company: This is a Point of
ſuch Importance, that upon it depends the whole Courſe of their Lives and
Manners; the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with wicked Men brings us acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Vice,
makes us behold it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Emotion, by Degrees we begin to act it with ſome
Pleaſure, and Time breeds in us a Habit.</p>

            <p>He that lives in this great Theatre of the World, ſhould in the
firſt Place learn how to ſuit himſelf into ſundry Habits, that he may
be inabled in this Comedy to represent many Perſons, no Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit to
appear upon this Stage till he knows how to Act his Part to the Life; and
therefore he muſt labour to have his Mind made pliable, which may ſtoop and
riſe according to the ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Capacities of Men he
aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates with, not fearing to ſpeak to the Greateſt with due
Obſervance, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to converſe familiarly with the Meaneſt,
reſpecting Goodneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſees it, which he ſhall as often find
under a Ruſſet Coat as under a <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0544000400:47"/> Velvet Caſſock, and
with Moral honeſt Men as ſoon as with the more Learned; for Converſation
hath made very accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd Perſons without the Aſſiſtance of
Learning, the World being a great Book which inſtructs continually,
Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are living Libraries, not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to Books; Good
Conferences are like Flints, which from a cold and dark Heap produce Heat and
Light, if Men ſtrike them one againſt the other; and the familiar
Diſcourſes of two or three good Wits may be more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to us than
the empty Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of many Pedants together, and they vent more in one
Hour than we ſhall read all Day in a Library.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that puts better Thoughts in a Man than a good
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; for Example hath the force of Precept, and touches the Heart with
an Affection to Goodneſs; and not only the frequent hearing, but the very
ſeeing of a Wiſe Man delights us.</p>
            <p>The beſt Rule herein is to aſſociate with thoſe who may be
the better for us, and we for them; theſe Reſpects are mutual; for while we
teach we learn: It is not Safe to truſt our ſelves with much Company;
whoſoever goes much abroad, he ſcarce comes home the same 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0544000400:48"/> Man he went out, ſomething or other diſcompoſes him;
for it is with our Minds, as it is after a long Indiſpoſition with our
Bodies, we are grown ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the leaſt Breath of Air expoſes us
to a Relapſe.</p>
            <p>There is certainly much Pleaſure and Satisfaction in communicating
our Thoughts, and in the Intercourſes of Friendſhip well choſen; and
therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid, <hi>If Knowledge and Wiſdom were offered
him, on the Terms of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and that he muſt not ſpeak of it, he would
poſitively refuſe the Preſent.</hi> And <hi>Tully</hi> in his
<hi>Offices</hi> tells us, <hi>If a Perſon had all the Bleſſings of this
Life, yet if he was kept from all Company, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſee or converſe
with Men, he had much rather Die, than Live in ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the firſt Step to Converſation is our outward Carriage and
Comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein the leſs we are conſtrain'd, our Actions and Thoughts
ſeem there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more Innocent: The Differences of Men are eaſily read in
their Behaviour, and a ſhort Obſervation of that will often tell us as much
as a long Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Some Mens Carriage is like a Verſe, where every
Syllable is meaſur'd; but where there is ſo much Care about the 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0544000400:49"/> Outſide, there is commonly a Remiſneſs in what
belongs to the Mind; it being as rare to ſee ſtarched complimental Man
Wiſe, as to ſee a Woman Valiant. There is a ſort of Men who have an
earneſt Application to make every thing ſit right about them, which
ſtrikes too deep into their ſmall Stock of Thoughts to allow it Furniture
for any thing elſe, and therefore to do right to theſe fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpun
Gentlemen, Converſation is too courſe a Thing for them, and it's beſt to
leave them to their Taylor, with whom they will live in better
Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence than with any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Indeed, a good Preſence and
handſome Mein, ſorted with Valour and Wiſdom, does a Man excellent
Service, (if he ſpoils it not with Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation) and carries with it (as
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> us'd to ſay) <hi>Letters or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation</hi>;
and if I am rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, this was the only Thing that brought the great
Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> into Favour with King <hi>James</hi> I. by
ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at a Maſque in Court. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if our outward Comportment be
good, the adorning the Mind does dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Excellency; if ill, it will make
it good, when the Mind performs what the Body promiſes not. Our Behaviour 
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0544000400:50"/> ſhould be like a well-made Suit of Cloaths, more proper
than gaudy, more fit than fine. In our outward Carriage, all manner of
Affectation is unſeemly, there being nothing more becoming a Gentleman than a
native Freedom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, a Gracefulneſs of Behaviour ſetting off much when
it is not conſtrain'd. Dancing is good, and adds Grace to a Man, when he well
performs it; but a Man muſt not ſet himſelf to it as if he made it his
Trade. Dancing makes the Body free, and not ſo ſtiff but to move
gracefully; and a Man's Skill is therein perceiv'd tho' he ſtands ſtill:
But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever intends to make it his Maſter-peice, one may call it excelling
in a Miſtake, which is <hi>no good Commendation,</hi> as a late great Lord
ſaid. It is a great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to be a good Actor; for Action is a kind of
Expreſſion, and Words well choſen are agreeable, when they expreſs
Things that pleaſe; ſo all that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Face and Body is
well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd when done with a good Grace. But we muſt not here miſtake:
For there are thoſe that are ſometimes Actors of Nothing, as well as
thoſe that are Speakers of Nothing: The Action and Air of the Countenance
have certain Charms, which have a great Influence <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0544000400:51"/> on our
Minds: An Oration ſpoken by a good Orator appears great and lofty, tho'
penn'd in common Terms, and compounded of ordinary Conceptions; and many
Preachers have in their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits charm'd their Auditors, whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in
Print were ſcarce worth Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I have heard Verſes recited in a good
Tone, which have been admir'd, which being read by another, their Eſteem was
much diminiſh'd; and it's probable the Reaſon of this Alteration proceeded
from the Harmony which was then wanting: We ſhould not look upon this as
ſtrange of good Orations, and agreeable Conferences, if we call to mind that
of Muſical Inſtruments, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Hands of an exquiſite Maſter;
there are ſome Tones which inſpire Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſweetly incline our
Souls to Languiſh; and there are Airs which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and make our Hearts
Merry, and pleaſingly compel our Feet to Dance their Time.</p>
            <p>In Converſation, it is not enough to have Wit, but he muſt be an
extream well-bred Man to know how to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Converſation,
amongſt Perſons that know how to Judge; becauſe moſt Men have not a
delicate Taſte, nor are able to diſcern what is beſt; and it often 
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0544000400:52"/> happens that ſuch Perſons are taken, nay even charm'd
with certain ridiculous Parts they play to them; but tho' theſe Fooleries are
current amongſt ſome, yet well-bred Perſons do not love ſuch kind of
Buffoonry, and thoſe that uſe them are rather the Subjects of Scorn than
Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to thoſe that rightly underſtand: Such are half-witted Men, who
have a tinſel Wit, which ſhines amongſt thoſe who cannot Judge, Petty
Merchants of ſmall Conceits, who have an empty Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Prating without
Meaning, they always aim at Wit, but generally make falſe Fire</p>
            <p>'Tis true, we cannot ſhew too much Wit in pleaſant
Converſation; yet a Man muſt have a great Care not to ſhew himſelf too
forward, as if one would appear ready to make Jeſts and ſpeak fine Things:
There is ſomething of a free way, which cannot be well expreſſed, which
hath a much better Effect; but yet it is not good to be too Reſerv'd, nor
affect Singularity; an open and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant Carriage hath very great Charms
to attract Love: However, what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ſoever any one hath, he muſt be
pleas'd with others, if he would have others pleas'd with him: And if we like
not our Company, let us withdraw from <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0544000400:53"/> them; but whilſt
we are in Company, we ſhould carry our ſelves ſo, that we ſhould be
acceptable to thoſe with whom we Converſe, tho' we have no Kindneſs for
them. As for thoſe who think to Revenge themſelves by a croſs Carriage,
they do themſelves more Injury than they do to others. The Love of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is Natural, but the Choice of our Company is Matter of Prudence, and the
Conſcience of giving good Example is one of the greateſt Obligations any
Man can lay upon the Age he lives in.</p>
            <p>It is indeed a fair Step towards Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Virtue, to delight
in the Converſation of good and wiſe Men, and where thoſe cannot be had,
it is beſt to keep no Company at all. When Men are Good and Virtuous, they
are as good alone as in Company, but moſt Men are of themſelves the worſt
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they can keep; let ſuch therefore Converſe with others, and avoid
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but he that cannot ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Privacy, ſhall be
much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in Publick. Many a Ship is loſt in the Harbour, but more
in the Ocean. There are ſome Perſons whoſe Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny we cannot too much
frequent; 'tis certain, by ſeeing them often, beſides the Improvement we
have by being with <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0544000400:54"/> them, we gain a good Eſteem to our
ſelves, as we Perfume our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares by walking amongſt the
Jeſſamins and Orange Trees. Witty Men, who are well-bred, always ſay
ſomething that pleaſes, and ſeldom do any thing which hath not ſome
Mark of Worth and Breeding; and by converſing with and obſerving them, we
may not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our ſelves of ſuch Things as are neceſſary to be
known for the making an accompliſh'd Man, but we alſo learn how to apply
them, and likewiſe ſo far as to know when 'tis proper and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly to be
Silent: But we muſt know how to diſtinguiſh, for we ſhall often hear
very good Things come from Men, who behave themſelves with as much
Becomingneſs as can be diſired; yet many times this is but borrow'd
Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and the Actings of a Part, and therefore we muſt not regard ſo
much that which appears Polite and Regular, as we do certain other Things,
which ſhew whether there be a Foundation, and that the Underſtanding goes
farther, and is of larger Extent.</p>
            <p>We find in ſome Men a certain Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs of Carriage,
which pleaſes in young People, but yet paſſes away like a Flower or a
Dream, and we ſhall often <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0544000400:55"/> ſee theſe Men become the
Neglect and Scorn of thoſe who once admir'd them; but a well-bred Man hath
more ſolid Virtues, tho' he be leſs buſie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſhew
himſelf in the World; and if we love a Man for his good Breeding and
Honeſty we ſhall always love him. Yet it is not enough to have a fair
Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to make a Man agreeable; that which is of greateſt Importance, is
the Will regulating our Intellectuals, and taking Care that our Head and our
Heart be in good Order; for no Man can ever be Excellent without having a good
Heart and much Wit.</p>
            <p>An accompliſh'd Perſon, tho' of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much Wit, ought not
to be too Confident of himſelf; for the more he Excels, the more Care he
ought to take not to Preſcribe to the Company; for naturally every Man is
afraid of a Maſter Wit, and Men do not love to be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor'd out of their
Opinions, it being eſteem'd the common Birth-right of Mankind, that every Man
to opine and judge according to the Dictates of his own Underſtanding, and
not of another's; and therefore a Magiſterialneſs in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is very
unbefitting Men in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, for it does not only faſten upon our
Nature, but upon the better Part of <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0544000400:56"/> it, our Reaſon:
Freedom is the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Thing in Society, and where that is controlled, Men
are not very fond of Aſſociating themſelves. 'Tis Natural for us to be
uneaſie in the Preſence of thoſe that aſſume an Authority over us; as
Children care not for the Company of their Parents or Tutors that govern them.
And Men will care leſs for theirs, who would make them Children by uſurping
a Tutorage over them. This Perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorineſs in Converſation renders Wiſe
Men diſobliging and very troubleſome, and Fools ridiculous and
contemptible, we ſeeing none ſo peremptory as half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted People, who have
juſt enough to excite their Pride, but not ſo much as to cure their
Ignorance: This is the Effect of a mean and imprudent Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a Man who
hath converſt only with the lower Sort of Company, who durſt not diſpute
nor examine his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thinks the ſame falſe Coin will paſs
over the World, which went cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant amongſt his Petty Comerades; And we may
obſerve this Fault is moſt uſual amongſt young Men, who have come raw
into Company with good Fortunes and ill Breeding. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe
Perſons are moſt to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who ſhew their Wit without offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0544000400:57"/> any one; and ſuch are uſually ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who make uſe
of Wit only to the diſpleaſing of others; and a Wiſe Man ought to avoid
the Company of ſuch, it being a ſmall Advantage to have Wit, if we do not
make uſe of it for gaining the good Opinion and Love of the World. We ought
to deal with others, with that Patience, Reſpect, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which we
expect from them, not ſetting forth our own Opinions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periouſly, nor
rejecting the Opinion of others arrogantly, remembring that we are all
enwrapped in a deep Miſt, and that all our Reaſoning is but groping in the
Dark; and therefore we ſhould paſs gently over the Errors of our
Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to oblige them to the like Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: But many Gentlemen are ſo
far from this generous Humour, that they always behave themſelves
diſdainfully in Company, as if they could not ſet a juſt Value upon
themſelves without the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Contempt of others. But this Pride is
commonly a Wind that blows only one Way, down Hill upon thoſe below him,
upwards they breath gentler Gales, it being one of their moſt ſtudied
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, to perform all Acts of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſuper-errogating Civility
to thoſe above them; Now there is nothing that <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0544000400:58"/> makes a
Man more diſtaſteful to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, than this haughty Humour, it being not
only Pride but Inhumanity, to attribute ſo much to the Prerogative of Birth,
as not to ſhew Affability and Reſpect to the Meaneſt.</p>
            <p>The Converſation of thoſe who are bred in Armies is not commonly
very pleaſing, but in Recompence, they are ſaid to be Men of Honour and
Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as if that would excuſe their Wants in every Thing elſe, when
there is nothing ſo diſguſting as to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable and moroſe in
Company. This is like certain Women, that pretend to Virtue, who value
themſelves much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their being Coy and Fierce, which makes Men think all
is counterfeit and affected, and that they are eaſier gotten, than thoſe
who obſerve good Manners and Breeding, and are as Affable as theſe are
Severe. Such Women are like thoſe peeviſh Miſtreſſes, who think they
have a Licence to Kick and Scratch, provided they do not Kiſs, as if Ladies
could not be honeſt without being rude. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident yet a modeſt Carriage,
which is neither mean nor ſullen, having nothing which ſavours not of
Goodneſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, is that which is moſt eſteem'd in the World, and
takes with every Body: <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0544000400:59"/> Women who have moſt Wit, like
beſt a diſcreet Reſervedneſs in Men, thoſe being uſually
diſappointed of their Aims, who throw, as it were, their Hearts at Ladies
Heads, and at the firſt Daſh tell them more of their Love, than can in any
probability be true, and many times more than they deſire to hear.</p>
            <p>In our Converſation, it is good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to ſpare and thriftily
to order that which a Man knows, and tho' he hath that in his Head which is
better than Silence, yet he ought to be more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear, than to ſpeak,
to learn, than to teach; it being a great Folly to be more ready to ſhew all
that is in us, rather than to learn Knowledge of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſpend our own
Stock, rather than to get new. When we hear we receive, when we ſpeak we
give, and tho' it be more glorious to give, yet it is more profitable to
receive; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a juſt Moderation herein is beſt, not to be
over-Silent nor Talkative, the firſt ſhewing Stupidity or Scorn, the laſt
Giddineſs of the Brain: Prudent Men will therefore ſpeak no more than to
bring on Diſcourſe, and will give others their turns of Speech; a Civil
Gueſt will no more Talk all, than Eat all the Feaſt. It is a great
Advantage to know <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0544000400:60"/> how to Speak and to Write; when either
ſmells too much of Study it pleaſes not; the general Opinion is, that Men
ſhould Write as they Speak, and Speak as they Write; but we ſeldom do
either, as we wiſh we could: In order to this, it were good when we Write to
imagine we are Speaking, that we may not put in any Thing that is not Natural,
or which may not be ſpoken in Company; and when we Speak, we ſhould fancy
we are Writing, that we may not ſay any Thing that is not fitting: Many
People are ſaid to Speak well who cannot Write well, but I doubt there is a
Miſtake herein, for ſome Men may ſeem to Speak well in Appearance, when
they do not in Effect: For when a Man really excels in Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he may do the
ſame in Writing; but this latter requires more Care, and one may Write well,
without knowing how to Speak well, for we uſually ſee thoſe who make it
their Buſineſs to Write well, have commonly a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Way of
Speaking; for to Speak well, is not only to make our Thoughts be underſtood,
but to expreſs our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, which are two very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Things;
and there is no greater ſign that a Man well underſtands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than
to be able perſpicuouſly to <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0544000400:61"/> Speak to the
Underſtanding of another; and our Diſcourſe ſhould always be meaſur'd
by the Aptneſs of it to whom it is Addreſſed; for unleſs our Speech be
fitted to the Capacities of thoſe we Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with, tho' it be never
ſo elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, it will rather Confound than Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</p>
            <p>Thus, the beſt Art of Speaking ſhews it ſelf under a natural
Dreſs; it is like plain natural Beauty, thoſe that are the moſt Perfect
ſhew themſelves leaſt, and when our Words ſmell of Art and Study, one
may conclude, they that ſay them have but little of either, or elſe that
they know not how to make uſe of them. This is the Fault of thoſe that
Speak ſo, that they cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but by the Learned: We ſhould
therefore to our Power rather mean Wiſely, than ſpeak Learnedly, much
leſs Affectedly; for thoſe whoſe Tongues run Proud after Words, are of
very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Uſe, but amongſt ſuch Ears as call a Bag-Pipe Muſick, for
their Lips open like a Purſe without Money, and their Tongues like a Fencer
before a Pageant, ſtir, but not ſtrike. A Gentleman ſhould talk like a
Gentleman, that is, like a Wiſe Man; his Knowledge ought to be general, he
ſhould have a Taſte of every <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0544000400:62"/> Thing, he ſhould not be
a Slave to one Science, one Knowledge is but Part of the Houſe, like a bay
Window, no Man will build his Houſe ſo maim'd, much leſs himſelf, he
muſt be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
            <p>All thoſe who have given Rules for Civil Life, have, in order to
it, put very ſevere Reſtrictions upon the Tongue, that it run not before
the Judgment. 'Twas <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Advice to Dip the Tongue in the Mind before
one ſhould Speak; and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> was us'd to ſay, It was
ſafer truſting to an unbridled Horſe, than to intemperate Speech; and
daily Experience confirms this Aphoriſm, for thoſe who ſet no Guard upon
their Tongues are hurried by them into a thouſand Indecencies, and very often
into real conſiderable Miſchiefs; and whereas Men ſhould keep a Lock upon
their Lips, they give their Tongue the Key of their Heart, and the Event hath
been often as Unhappy, as the Proceeding was Prepoſterous.</p>
            <p>And as our Words muſt be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our Judgment, ſo they
muſt be temperate and decent, mixed with Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie and Civility; for he
that hath calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Paſſions, hath nothing to betray them to raſh and
rude Language, which <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0544000400:63"/> is a Foam caſt up only by the
Billows of a turbulent Mind, and can never be the Iſſues of a ſerene
compoſed Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; neither does any thing Charm us more than gracious
Language, <hi>Quae ne illos quidem quos damnat offendit</hi>; a pregnant
Example of which was ſeen in the laſt Age, at the Tryal of the Earl of
<hi>Strafford,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the Year 1642.
where, amongſt others that were appointed by the Houſe of Commons to Manage
their Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him, there was one emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Lawyer, who urged very
ſmartly againſt his Lordſhip, but yet with great Reſpect and Civility
of Language; And when the Earl came to Reply, as he did to every one, he ſaid
he had been very roughly handled by moſt of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but that he was
very much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to one civil Gentleman amongſt them, (naming the former
Perſon) who, tho' he had touched him nearer the Quick than any other, yet he
was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to return him Thanks, becauſe he had cut his Throat with a clean
Knife: Thus we ſee good Words are afforded at the ſame Price as ill, and
are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheap, but prevalent upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0544000400:64"/>Next to this Graciouſneſs of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, we
ſhould be very careful that our Speeches carry Integrity with them, Candour
and Ingenuity being moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd in Diſcourſe: Thoſe who have
upright Hearts, their Judgment (how ſmall ſoever) will be ſtill the
ſame, but thoſe who have many Turnings and Doubles in their Heart, never
have a right Underſtanding, there is always ſome counterfeit Light, which
gives them falſe Appearances, and then their Artifices and Craft ſhew they
have not Parts ſufficient to effect their Deſigns by fair and honeſt
Ways; whereas the way that pleaſes worthy Perſons, is that Freedom of
Plain-Dealing. What a Gracefulneſs ſo clear a Source gives to all the
Actions of our Life? How it beautifies our Words and Thoughts? And how
pleaſing a Thing it is to Speak well, when ſo much Sincerity goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it? And tho' one may not perhaps be Happy in all Things by following this
Maxim; however, one is ſure at leaſt to gain the Eſteem and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of
thoſe who underſtand true Merit, nothing being ſo commendable in
Converſation as to have an upright and ſincere Heart, which ſeems to be
the Foundation of Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0544000400:65"/>Speech was given to Man as the Image and
Interpreter of the Soul: It is <hi>anime index &amp; ſpeculum,</hi> the
Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Heart, the Gate by which all that is within iſſues
forth, and comes into open Veiw: And therefore the Philoſopher ſaid well to
the Child, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere ut te videam,</hi> Speak that I may ſee thee, that is
the Inſide of thee; for as Veſſels are known whether they be broken or
whole by their inward Sound; ſo is Man from his Speech, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with
it not only a great Influence, but a great Diſcovery of our Minds; and
Integrity herein is the publick Faith of Mankind. With all ſorts of Men we
ſhould deal ingeniouſly yet reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, ſaying what we think, but
think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than we ſay, it being not good to ſay at all Times all that
the Heart think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, tho' all that the Heart thinketh be good. Freedom of
Speech is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be foreborn, leaſt we give others Power thereby to
lay hold on the Rudder of our Minds; for in all there are ſome Places weaker
than others, and prudent Men will take heed of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncover'd that Way: 'Tis
true there may be poſſibly in Diſcourſe a Fault of Omiſſion; but
this is a right-hand Error; a Man may be ſometimes ſorry he ſaid 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0544000400:66"/> no more, but very often that he ſaid ſo much: God hath
given us two Ears and one Mouth, that we ought to Hear more than to Speak; we
have no Ear-Lids to keep us from Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and often muſt Hear againſt our
Will; but our Mouth ſhuts naturally, and we may keep our Tongue from
Speaking, unleſs by Intemperance we loſe that Privilege of Nature.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, our Tongue is ſo ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery that is eaſily
deceives a heedleſs Guard, Nature hath given it ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Advantages
towards it, it being the moſt ready for Motion of any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and therefore
is to be the more carefully managed; the chiefeſt Rules to be preſcribed
herein, are Sufficiency and Pertinency, a Man ſhould not only know what to
ſay, but what not to ſay, for in Speech enough is better than all; Words
are but the Lacquies of Reaſon, of which to ſend more than will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Buſineſs is ſuperfluous, and the Diſcretion in Speaking, is not
ſo much in Speaking few Words, as in Speaking none Impertinent; otherwiſe
the Dumb were Born with great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, if we muſt retrench the Uſe of
the Tongue, inſtead of moderating it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0544000400:67"/>A wiſe Man's Words muſt be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and
material; they are <hi>weighed in the Balance,</hi> ſays the Son of
<hi>Syrach</hi>; and therefore a Gentleman's Diſcourſe ſhould be ſuch
as might anſwer that Character, no Man ever attempting to put Froth and
Bubbles into the Scales.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Zeno</hi> heard a young Man full of Talk, <hi>Aures inquit
in linguam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxêre,</hi> he ſaid, His Ears were fallen into his
Tongue; intimating thereby, that they ſhould Hear much and Speak little: The
Truth is, when People are very young, they cannot Judge rightly of any Thing;
and it happens either by Experience, Reflections, or meeting with ſome
intelligent Perſons, they come to be of another Mind, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe that
which they once ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd, and many Times laugh at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when
they examine themſelves without Flattery. It is certain, he that always Talks
adventures himſelf too far, thereby depriving himſelf of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the great Advantage of Society, and from whence comes Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and
Wiſdom: Herein we ſhould imitate cunning Shopkeepers, who ſhew their
Wares in a half Light, upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion we ſhould Speak but ſparingly, and
rather Starve than Surfeit our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0544000400:68"/> Our
Diſcourſes muſt not be too florid in the beginning; it is a Thing much to
be wiſhed, that all which one ſays be good and fine, according as the
Subject merits; but we muſt proceed by Degrees; Nature is in this, as in all
other Things, a very knowing Miſtreſs; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how She proceeds
inſenſibly, the faireſt Day when it begins to break and appear, hath ſo
little Light, that it is hardly diſcernable whether it be Day or Night; and
nothing is ſo great a ſign that the way of Speaking is noble, as when it
leaves ſome certain Things to be apprehended without Speaking them; and
therefore it is good to know when to give over, and to proceed to other
Matters, or at leaſt we ſhould give them another Face and Turn, becauſe
Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity ſeems not tedious.</p>
            <p>To make our ſelves be heard with Pleaſure, we muſt ſay
ſuch Things as others will be glad to hear, and ſay them pleaſantly,
which is the beſt way to make us be belov'd; beſides, when we pleaſe
others well, we are likewiſe better pleas'd with our ſelves. Excellent
Painters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver draw all, they ſtill allow ſomething for you to exerciſe
your own Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and always leave you more to find out than they
diſcover; The Graces ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0544000400:69"/> very rarely, and even when
they are ſeen, they will not be conſider'd full fac'd nor uncover'd; in the
ſame manner we ſhould not open our ſelves too much; and in our
Diſcourſes we ſhould obſerve this as a general Rule, Either to Speak
fitly, or to be Silent wiſely; for many by their Silence may paſs for
Wiſe Men, whom Speech would preſently diſcover otherwiſe. When the
Aſs diſguiſed himſelf in the Lyon's Skin, he frighted all the Beaſts,
and even the cunning Fox, till he heard him Bray. <hi>Pro certo ſcias niſi
rudentem audiviſſem &amp; te ego timueſſem:</hi> Unlearned Men, which
ſeem of Ability to Strangers, are quickly diſcover'd by their Loquacity,
and thoſe that ſpeak much in Company ſeldom ſpeak well, for they that
well underſtand themſelves know not how to dwell in Talk. <hi>Long
Diſcourſes,</hi> ſays <hi>Plutarch, like over-feather'd Arrows, ſhoot
beyond the Mark, and by wearying the Attention, ordinarily loſe both Game and
Labour. Ariſtotle</hi> anſwer'd a Man well, who having held him in a long
Diſcourſe, in the end begg'd his Excuſe, telling him he might have
ſav'd his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, for he had not minded what he ſaid. And it was a
ſmart Reply of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> to an ill Poet, repeating many of 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0544000400:70"/> his Verſes, and asking which he liked beſt,
anſwer'd, <hi>Thoſe which he had omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> And indeed, the Company of
ſuch who Talk much to little Purpoſe, ought as little to be regarded; for
if a Man be vain and trifling in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, both he that hears, and
he that anſwers, will be equal Loſers of their Time. And if we ſhut our
Ears to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Diſcourſes, much more carefully ought we to keep our
Hearts from drawing in the Breath of obſcene Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, which are the
very Peſt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. We ſhould herein imitate <hi>Xenocrates</hi>
the Philoſopher, who being asked an obſcene Queſtion, and giving no
anſwer, being again importun'd to Anſwer, ſaid well; <hi>De tali re te
homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem vanum interrogare decet, me autem reſpondere nequaquam:</hi>
Obſcene Speeches, like Oil falling upon Linnen, will ſpread much; and as
the Poiſon of the Body enters by the Mouth, ſo the Poiſon of the Heart
enters by the Ear; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who have Honeſty in their Hearts,
will have only civil and modeſt Words in their Mouths.</p>
            <p>Next to Modeſty in our Converſation, we muſt be careful not to
be too inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive into other Men's Affairs; and if we would be perſuaded
to affect a <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0544000400:71"/> wholſom Ignorance therein, it would much
conduce to our Eaſe and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; for it is the Itch of the Ear that breaks
out at the Tongue, and were not Curioſity the Purveyor, this Trade would
ſoon be ſet aſide. The Boy in <hi>Plutarch</hi> being ask'd what he
carried hid under his Cloak, anſwer'd well, <hi>That he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carried it

Things ſhews a great Weakneſs and Folly in the Inquiror.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Socrates</hi> was asked by a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon, What was
done in the next World; he told him, <hi>He had never been there, nor ſpoken

            </p>
            <p>We ſhall ſee ſome Men very inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into the Religion of
their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, being very ſhy of diſcourſing with Men of differing
Perſuaſions, and put on an angry Zeal againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving they are
fighting God Almighty's Quarrel, and therefore grow into a hardned Severity
againſt all who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them; And we ſhall frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee Men,
whoſe Manners and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are very conformable in all the 
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0544000400:72"/> neceſſary Obligations of Human Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to avoid each
others Company, and grow unſociable to each other, meerly becauſe the one
cannot think as the other does: Whereas our Opinions come from our Heads, our
Affections from our Hearts; and therefore a wiſe Man will no more trouble
himſelf about his Companions Religion, than about the Religion of his
Phyſician or Lawyer: The Offices of Friendſhip which one Man owes to
another, having nothing to do with that Conſideration; and Men do not ſo
much queſtion, whether their Servants be Virtuous, as whether they be
Diligent, which is the Thing for which they make uſe of them. But yet this is
a pernicious Error, for Men to think themſelves no otherwiſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in
their Servants, than they are in their Horſes and Oxen, to look upon them
only as another Species of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cattle; and, ſo they do their
Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, care not how arrant Brutes they be: Whereas Gentlemen ſhould
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that they with themſelves are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Servants to one great
Maſter; and that the Subjection of one to the other, is but the wiſe
Oeconomy of their Lord, who hath made the one as Stewards or Superviſors to
regulate the reſt, and <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0544000400:73"/> then it will appear a great
Unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to neglect this Charge; for tho' they receive Wages, they are
not below their Care, Nature having made no ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and Returns
of Kindneſs and good Uſage are as much their Due to ſuch of them as
deſerve it, as their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is due to their Maſters when they require it.
But leaving this Digreſſion, there are others ſo far from this
Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that in their Diſcourſes they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and mock at
Religion, becauſe they would not be under the Reſtraints of it; Religion is
againſt them, and therefore they ſet themſelves againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and
it is obſervable, that thoſe who upon other Subjects their beſt Friends
muſt needs acknowledge to be ſufficiently dull, yet can talk very wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
in derogation of Religion, with ſome kind of ſalt and ſmartneſs; and
becauſe Religion frets them, it makes them wynch and fling, and gives them
ſome kind of Wit and Sharpneſs in rallying againſt it. Theſe are
Perſons that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſay any Thing well, but what is ill to ſay; and
therefore we muſt be very careful to diſtinguiſh between what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts the
Title of Wit from our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that which appears but ſuch to our
Corruptions: This prophane Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0544000400:74"/> is too much us'd in
our Nation, and hath croſſed thoſe Seas which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron <hi>England,</hi>
which is not ſo happily ſever'd from the World's Vices, as from its
Continent: But I wonder how ſuch Men ſhould have the Fortune to be
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed Wits, only for Jeſting out of the common Road, and for making
bold to ſcoff at thoſe Things, which ought to be reverenced of all Mankind;
But we are fallen into ſuch a prophane and ſceptical an Age, as takes a
Pleaſure and Pride in unravelling almoſt all the received Principles of
Religion.</p>
            <p>However, we muſt not think the worſe of Religion, becauſe
ſome Men are ſo bold as to deſpiſe and deride it; for it is no
Diſparagement for any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Thing to be Laughed at, but to deſerve
to be ſo; there being nothing ſo excellent but a Man may find Ways to
traduce it, and therefore we ought not to have the leſs Reverence for the
Principles of Religion, becauſe idle and prophane Perſons can break Jeſts
upon them, for a little Wit with a great deal of ill Nature will eaſily
furniſh a Man for Satyre; there being nothing ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, which by the
petulancy of Wit, may not be made ridiculous; and thoſe Buffoons which do
ſo, ſpare neither <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0544000400:75"/> their Souls nor Reputation to ſhew
their Abilities, by prophane more than inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Sallies: But it were happy if
Men would uſe a nobler Exerciſe for their Wits, than to perſiſt in
their ſcoffing Humour, which is not only an Enemy to Religion, but to every
Thing elſe that is worthy; and yet we ſhall ſee ſome Men ſo prophane,
as to make uſe of Scripture Phraſes to give a reliſh to their moſt
inſipid Diſcourſes; and were it not for this Magazine, a great many Men's
Raillery would want Supplies, and they would be very Mute without this Topick.
In our Converſation, we ſhould carefully avoid the cuſtomary Sin of
Swearing, which hath none of thoſe Allurements which other Sins have; ſuch
Men play the Platonick to Damnation; and the great wonder is, that we ſee
none who own God more in their Oaths, than thoſe that diſ-own him in their
Lives; a great Abſurdity of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to have a God to Swear by, none to
Believe in, none to Pray to. There is indeed ſuch a Deluge of Impiety and
Prophaneſs at this Day overflowing our afflicted Nation, that it hath brought
down moſt terrible Judgments upon it: Wickedneſs is now become the Mode and
Faſhion amongſt them; ſo that Men <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0544000400:76"/> there begin now to
fear the Singularity of being Innocent; and a Man may with leſs Scorn appear
there in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated Habit of our Forefathers, than to own the obſolete
and condemned Qualities of true Piety, Loyalty, Duty and Sobriety; And what
Temptation is it to the Vulgar to be Wicked, when their Superiors have beaten
the Path before them: When Gentlemen are Atheiſtical, Clowns will think
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very modeſtly Wicked if they be but Prophane; and when they
hear their Betters ſwear, they will ſoon find they are as well qualified
for that part of Greatneſs as the beſt. It were very happy for our Nation,
if thoſe Seducers of the People would ſound a Retreat to their miſ-led
Followers, and would teach them Religion, Obedience, and Submiſſion, as
they have formerly led them to Impiety and Diſobedience.</p>
            <p>But to return to our intended Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; Gentlemen in their
Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought never to reveal Secrets. Our Eyes, Tongues and Looks, are
the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Doors of our Hearts, we ſhould therefore be cautious to keep
every thing from breaking out, which may be ſafelier hid than revealed. The
Wits of futilous Perſons are like the <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0544000400:77"/> Veſſels of the
<hi>Danaides,</hi> that emptied as faſt as they fill'd; that which comes in
at the Ear, goes preſently out at the Mouth, becauſe Indiſcretion, which
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects to hearken, as lightly as to Speak, lets fly out, as eaſily as lets
in, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſes as ſoon as collects. Theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh what they
know, only that they may be telling of News, an itch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their Tongues
are ſtrangely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run, who can as well hold a glowing Coal in their Mouths,
as keep any thing Secret which they think new, which is a moſt childiſh
Vanity, and Men muſt have Souls of a very low level, that can think this a
fit Entertainment: Theſe Men not having uſually Depth enough to ſupply
themſelves out of their own Store, can therefore let nothing paſs by them,
no more than a Mill, which is always going, cannot afford any Water to run
waſte. Now theſe Men are more Impertinent, and not leſs Injurious than
the moſt Malicious; <hi>Anacreon,</hi> who was choaked with a Grape-ſtone,
died as ſurely as <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> with his Three and twenty Wounds;
and a Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is as ſoon fool'd and prated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as maliciouſly
Betray'd, nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more eaſily; for where the Speaker can leaſt be
ſuſpected of Deſign, the <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0544000400:78"/> Hearer is the apter to give
him Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; and this way of inſinuating, is like thoſe Poiſons taken in
at the Pores, which are moſt inſenſibly ſucked in, and the moſt
difficult to expel. Theſe Men are ſo perpetually Buſie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
employ'd in finding Faults with others, that they cannot look towards
themſelves; and whilſt they put falſe Dreſſes and Varniſhes to hide
their own Deformity, they cannot allow the leaſt Imperfection of another's to
remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detected. If theſe Men would look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Hearts, they
would find ſuch work for their Inquiſitions and Cenſure, that they
ſhould not be at leiſure to Ramble abroad for it: Now ſuch as Buſie
themſelves with Tales of their Neighbours, and entertain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with them,
furniſh their Wits, as young Girls do their Cloſets, with Shells and
Gew-Gaws; and ſince they beſtow their Time ſo ill, they ſhould Study
the Anatomy of Flies; and to puniſh their Bodies as well as their Minds, they
ſhould live only upon Shrimps, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is more Buſineſs than Meat:
It is indeed a groſs Error to think (ſo we ſpeak in Truth) we may declare
any Mans Faults, for we muſt as well ſpeak in Charity as Truth, and yet
many Men <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0544000400:79"/> will ſlide eaſily into Detraction, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it no great Matter, not conſidering the ſmalleſt Sins are the Devils
greateſt Stratagems; and if <hi>Satan</hi> fetter us, it is indifferent to
him, whether it be by a Cable, or by a Hair: St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> therefore,
who was ſenſible of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs of this Vice, had this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diſtick written over his Table. 
<q> 
                  <l>Quiſquis amat dictis abſentum rodere vitam,</l> 
                  <l>Hanc menſam vetitam noverit eſſe ſibi.</l>
               </q> The Truth
is, we ſhould never in our Diſcourſes make abſent Perſons the Subject
of our Mirth; thoſe Freedoms which we uſe to a Man's Face, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
more moderate and equitable, becauſe we expoſe our ſelves to the like
from him; but Backblows are diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, ſhewing we intend not a fair
Tryal of Wit, but a cowardly Murther of a Man's Fame: But ſome Men think
their Wits to be a-ſleep, if they dart not out ſomething that is piquant,
and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to the Quick, but this Vein ought to be bridled. 
<q>Parce puer ſtimulis, &amp; fortius utere loris.</q> 
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0544000400:80"/> There is great difference between Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and
Bitterneſs, and no Weapon cuts ſo deep as a reproachful Word, neither is
any Wound longer in curing; And thoſe Jeers are moſt reſented which touch
a Man's Reputation, chiefly that of Wit and Diſcretion, of which even Fools
ſeem wary, and few will confeſs their Ignorance: The Reproaches of Wit are
like the Corrodings of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> they ingrave and indent
Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters that can never be defaced; a dull Reproach quickly vaniſhes, no
Perſon thinking it worth remembring, but when 'tis ſteel'd with Wit, it
pierceth deep, leaving ſuch Impreſſions in the Fancies of the Hearers,
that it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to ſurvive both Speaker and Hearer, and carries
it ſelf to Poſterity: Many a poor Man's Infirmities had been confin'd
within a narrow Compaſs, had not ſome picquant ſtrain of Drollery
ſcatter'd and diſperſt them; And therefore thoſe who rejoyce in Point
of Reflection upon each other, that love to diſparage and backbite their
Fellow-Creatures, and gratifie their proud and haughty Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in Deriſion of
others, ſhould read thoſe excellent Verſes, which to this Purpoſe St.
<hi>Proſper</hi> gives us in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Epigram:

            </p>
            <p>Defamation is certainly one of the moſt unkind Deſigns that one
Man can have upon another, every Man being naturally tender of his Reputation,
which yields a Perfume even after Death, and a Man's Reputation can hardly be
toſſed without receiving ſome Bruiſe; the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Scandals under which
ſome Men have lain, having taken their Riſe only from ſome Inadvertence
or Indiſcretion; and even doubtful Accuſations leave a Stain behind them,
and often prove indelible Injuries to the Party accuſed: And as in the Caſe
of Stealing, it is Proverbially ſaid, <hi>If there were no Receivers, there
would be no Thieves</hi>; ſo in this of Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if there were fewer
Spreaders, there would be fewer Forgers of Libels, the Manufacture would be
diſcouraged, if it had not theſe Retailers to put off the Wares. A Man may
ſometimes do Things which to God and his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are abominable,
and yet keep <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0544000400:82"/> his Reputation with Men, but when his
ſecret Crimes are detected, then he becomes infamous; ſo that tho' his own
Sin be the material Cauſe, yet the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is the formal Cauſe of his
Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and he that hath divulg'd his Fault ſtands accountable for all the
Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that flow from that divulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Some Men are maliciouſly apt to run down the Reputation of any
that ſtand in their way either of Pleaſure or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment: When
<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Chaſtity had changed the Scene of <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s
Wife's Paſſion, ſhe preſently fixes the Crime upon him: So when
<hi>Ziba</hi> had a Mind to undermine <hi>Mephiboſeth</hi> in his Eſtate,
he firſt practiſes upon his Fame in a falſe Accuſation: And how often
have we ſeen in our Time theſe Scenes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted; and tho' many Men have been
Wicked enough to commit this Crime, yet none have been ſo Impudent as to avow
it; all Crimes have had their Abettors, only this Sort of impudent and lying
Slander is ſo much the Dregs and Refuſe of wicked Men, that none have yet
had Chymiſtry enough to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate it, and to bring it into ſuch a
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that any Man would think fit to own it, till our laſt infamous
Age of <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0544000400:83"/> inſulting Vice, where this Wickedneſs has not
only been admitted into Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but appears alſo bare-faced, which did
always before keep on the Vizard; for no Man had ever the Confidence before to
own himſelf a falſe Accuſer of his Brethren, till that moſt wicked Age,
which hath not only permitted, but encouraged and rewarded Men for being
falſe Accuſers, to the eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of our Nation, and of them that
ſuffered it.</p>
            <p>Next to avoiding the Converſation of theſe foremention'd, we
ſhould be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of Converſing with ſuch who Cenſure and Judge
ſeverely of other Men's Actions, which is one of the higheſt Violations of
Charity; and a good Man will never make ſevere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, but ſet
every Thing in the faireſt Light, and put upon it the moſt candid
Interpretation that the Matter will bear, which is of great Importance to the
Reputation of our Neighbour: For he that gives the firſt ill Character of a
Man, fixes the Stamp, which ever after goes currant in the World, it being the
Buſineſs of many to lay on more Load, but of few to take it off; for moſt
People leſſen their own Beam into a Moat, and magnifie their Neighbour's 
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0544000400:84"/> Moat into a Beam: They turn the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe End of the
Perſpective to repreſent their own Faults ſmall and at a diſtance, and
ſhuffle the other End to their Neighbour, to make theirs ſeem great. Now
ſuch as make bitter Invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other Men's Faults, and indulge and
palliate their own, ſhew their Zeal lies in their Spleen, and conſider not
ſo much what is done, as who does it. A Man that affects an extraordinary
Splendor of Reputation, is glad to find any Foiles to ſet him off, and will
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no Fault nor Folly of another enjoy the Shade, but bring it into
open Light, that by ſuch Compariſon his own Excellencies may appear the
brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; But this ſhews a degenerous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and becauſe he wants
ſolid Worth, on which to bottom his Reputation, he is feign to found it on
the Ruins of other Mens. Diamonds ſparkle in the Sun-ſhine, 'tis but a
Glow-worm Virtue that owes his Luſtre to the Darkneſs about it.
<hi>Tacitus</hi> gives it as an ill In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of <hi>Domitian</hi> the
Emperor's Temper, That he imploy'd himſelf in catching and tormenting Flies,
and that he turn'd his Scepter into a Fly-flap, and was therefore juſtly
eſteem'd an Enemy to Flies, and a Fly to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0544000400:85"/>
and truly they fall not under a much better Character, either for Wiſdom or
good Nature, who ſnatch up all the fluttering Reports they can meet with to
the Prejudice of their Neighbour.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever hath a tender Side, the World will be ſure to find it,
and to put the worſt Colour on all that Man ſays or does, give an
Aggravation to every Thing that may leſſen him, and a ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Turn to
every Thing that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him; But that Wit is much miſemploy'd, that
is wholly directed to diſcern the Faults of others, when it is neceſſary
to be uſed to mend and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his own: When we do not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently turn our
Eyes inward, to ſee what is amiſs within us, it is a ſign we have an
unwelcome Proſpect at home, when we care not to look upon it, but rather
ſeek our own Conſolation in the Faults of thoſe we Converſe with.</p>
            <p>Indeed, ſome Men's Tempers are ſo malign, that they wiſh Ill
to all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Ill of all Men, like <hi>Timon</hi> the
<hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> who profeſt himſelf an univerſal Man-Hater: 'Tis
certain there are ſome, in whoſe Ears nothing ſounds ſo harſh as the
Commendation of another, and nothing ſo melodious to them as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation.
<hi>Plutarch</hi> gives an apt Inſtance <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0544000400:86"/> of this upon
<hi>Ariſtides</hi>'s Baniſhment. When a mean Perſon had propos'd
O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraciſme, being asked, What Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>Ariſtides</hi> had
done, he reply'd, None, and that he knew him not, but that it griev'd him to
the Heart, to hear every one call him a Juſt Man. I verily believe ſome of
our keeneſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers in theſe Days might give the ſame Anſwer; for
no Man that is eminent either for Piety, Loyalty, or Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but he
ſhall have many invidious Eyes upon him, watching for his Halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if
any the leaſt Obliquity be eſpied, he is uſed worſe than the vileſt
Malefactor, for ſuch are try'd but at one Bar, but theſe are arraigned in
all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies and in all Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>Next to raſh Cenſurers, Flatterers are moſt dangerous, who may
be compar'd to Flies that have pretty ſhining Wings for two or three hot
Months, but the leaſt cold Weather makes an end of them; or rather like the
<hi>Heliotrope,</hi> open only towards the Sun, but ſhut and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
themſelves at Night. Let the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Adoration be but eclipſed,
they can ſee none of thoſe Excellencies which before dazzled their Eyes,
and their old Idol is often made a Sacrifice to their new, and all malicious
Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0544000400:87"/> is made of their falling Friend, to make an
Intereſt in their riſing one. There are ſuch Crowds of Examples of this
Kind in our Age and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Kingdom, that it is fitter to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Precedents for the future, than to borrow any of the paſt Times.</p>
            <p>This is certainly the moſt horrid Crime that could be committed,
and the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Colour wherein we can view a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; and as an Ape
hath a peculiar De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity above other Brutes, by that awkard and ungraceful
Reſemblance he has to a Man; ſo a Flatterer is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more hateful,
for being the ugly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit of a Friend. A Pretence of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and
Kindneſs is now become the general Bait to all baſe Projects, all the
woolfiſh Deſigns that have been lately acted upon our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Stage, have walked under this Sheeps Cloathing; and as the World goes, Men have
more need to beware of thoſe who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Friends, than thoſe who
own themſelves Enemies, becauſe the one traiterouſly Betrays you,
whilſt you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no better from the other.</p>
            <p>It was heretofore the Character given of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by
an ingenious Perſon, That they were both excellently En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, and rarely
tempered by God <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0544000400:88"/> and Nature, and were the moſt piouſly
affected of all others; and that there were not in the whole World either
better Catholicks or better Proteſtants; that there was no Nation under
Heaven more remote from ill Nature and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, nor Men who were more
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and even more naturally Juſt, nor ſo far diſtant from uſing
baſe Treachery of every Kind. But, alas, the Race is now ſpoiled by
mixture, and we are no more what we were, every one endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to Deceive
and Delude each other; and that Freedom and good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (which was thought
peculiar to <hi>England</hi>) which is a kind of Balſom to the whole Life of
Man, (and without which Life is no better than a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both to others,
and moſt of all to a Man's ſelf) is baniſhed out of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and
thoſe Flowers of Virtue, which were thought to grow no where elſe but in
our Iſland, are now degenerated into Weeds of Flattery, Treachery, and
Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining: Now the Suppreſſion of this Vice depends upon thoſe
Perſons to whom it is addreſſed; let but Princes entertain ſuch
Paraſites with a ſevere Brow, and with ſharp Expreſſions of
Diſlike, theſe Leeches will immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall off. In <hi>Sparta,</hi> when
all Laws <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0544000400:89"/> againſt Theft prov'd ineffectual, at laſt
they fixed the Penalty upon them that were robbed, and that did the
Buſineſs; and if it were made amongſt us as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous to be Flatter'd, as
it is to Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I believe it might have the ſame Effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> gives an excellent Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a Man that could
not be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Flatter, in the Perſon of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loxenus,</hi> who
being a good Poet, and deſpiſing ſome dull Poetry of <hi>Dionyſius</hi>
the Tyrant, he was by him condemned to the Quarries; where having been for
ſome Time, he was by the Mediation of Friends recalled; and at his firſt
Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſhew'd him ſome other of his Verſes,
which he thought his Maſter-Piece; which, as ſoon as <hi>Philoxenus</hi>
had read, he made no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but call'd to the Guards to carry him back again
to the Quarries; a brave Example of a Heathen Poet, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd a corporal
Slavery before a mental.</p>
            <p>As it is a great Part of Wiſdom not to be flatter'd, ſo it is to
paſs by the Reproaches of others: Herein we ſhould imitate
<hi>Socrates,</hi> who being informed of ſome derogating Speeches one had
uſed of him behind his Back, made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Reply, <hi>Let him Beat me
too,</hi> 
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0544000400:90"/> 
               <hi>when I am abſent, I care not</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is good to ſhun the Company of thoſe
who take Pleaſure in expoſing others to Contempt and Deriſion, as one
would avoid the Heels of a Horſe that Kicks every one he can reach.</p>
            <p>It is the height of Incivility to abuſe Perſons in
Diſcourſe; to abuſe Inferiors argues a mean contemptible Spirit,
Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors is dangerous; to abuſe a Friend is to loſe him; a Stranger, to
loſe your ſelf in his and the World's Eſteem: We ſhould therefore
endeavour to keep a fair Reputation with all Perſons, with Superiors 'tis
good to be humble and complaiſant, not low and flattering, with Equals grave
not moroſe, with Inferiors courteous and fair, not ſullen nor
impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</p>
            <p>'Tis an indiſcreet Thing for a Man in Company to take Exceptions;
and if he have any Defect in his Perſon, which he ſuſpects Men are apt to
make Deriſion of, 'tis a Folly to vex himſelf or quarrel at it; but the
beſt way to prevent others in their Scoffs of this kind, is, firſt to
ſpeak, and let them know as much as they can tell him; and then he ought with
a manly Courage, to contemn, as unconcerned, the Indiſcretions and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of others: It is no ſign a Man is <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0544000400:91"/> ſound, who complains
becauſe one touches him. In my younger Days, I knew an old merry Droll, who
much frequented Company, who having in his Youth taken a great Liberty to rally
upon married Perſons, in his declining Age took a Wife, where every one might
have had her for his Money; and the firſt Treatment of any Friend in his
Converſation, was ſtill the Diſcourſe of his own Marriage, to prevent
all that could be ſaid againſt him.</p>
            <p>And as we ſhould not be troubled when others tell us of our
Imperfections, ſo on the other hand we ſhould never Praiſe our ſelves:
It is a great Blemiſh for a Man to be the Trumpet of his own Excellencies; he
who puts a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Rate upon his own Deſerts, does beſt multiply his
Fame, but he that ſpeaks in his own Commendations, does as if he meant to
Sell himſelf. And if the moſt accompliſh'd would but ſeriouſly
conſider his own Imperfections, how many Things he wants, and how few he
knows, and thoſe how lamely, he would make uſe of his Reaſon and
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, not for Commendation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but to gain Inſtruction
from others. Such Men's Company is very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, who are only
accuſtomed to the <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0544000400:92"/> Admiration of themſelves, thinking
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides them worthy of Regard; if theſe unbred Minds were made
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe Excellencies which God hath beſtow'd on other Men,
they would not think themſelves like <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Fleece, to <hi>have
ſucked up all the Dew of Heaven</hi>; they would find perhaps they rather
anſwer'd the other Part of the Miracle, and <hi>are drier than their
Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:</hi> And if ſuch will needs be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on themſelves, let
them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Crop of Weeds and Nettles with that of their Corn, and then
they muſt either think their Ground is Poor, or themſelves very ill
Husbands.</p>
            <p>Now the way to Profit by Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt come from our
ſelves, our Queſtion is the Fire, that draws out ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the
Quinteſſence or the Dreggs of Things; and therefore the uſefulleſt Part
of Diſcourſe is to give Occaſion by ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Queſtions, by intermingling
our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with Tales, with Reaſons, and telling of Opinions, it
being a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of as much Knowledge, to ask a pertinent Queſtion, as to
give a perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Anſwer: But herein a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be had in what
Company we do it, for great Men love not to be asked Queſtions, unleſs
where Queſtions <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0544000400:93"/> may pull out the Thread of their own
Praiſes: He that in Diſcourſe queſtions much, ſhall undoubtedly learn
much, if he apply his Queſtions to the Skill of the Perſons with whom he
Diſcourſes, and put them upon thoſe Things they underſtand beſt; for
thereby he ſhall do them a Kindneſs, in giving them Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to pleaſe
themſelves in Speaking, becauſe every one loves to Speak of that wherein he
is moſt expert, and himſelf ſhall continually gather Knowledge, by
fetching from every one the beſt that is in him; for when Men are reduced to
Speak of thoſe Things wherein they are moſt converſant and skillful, the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with them is an excellent School: But we ſhall commonly ſee
Men take the contrary Courſe, chuſing rather to Diſcourſe of any other
Profeſſion than their own, ſuppoſing it to be ſo much new Reputation
gotten; but this way a Man ſhall never come to Perfection: As for Tales, to
tell a Story well, to continue it in a handſome Method, cloathing it with
ſuitable Expreſſions without Impertinencies, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent therein
Perſons and Things to the Life, is one of the beſt, and perhaps one of the
hardeſt Parts of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The late King <hi>Charles</hi> II. my 
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0544000400:94"/> Maſter, of Glorious Memory, had a moſt particular
Talent of this Kind, and was wonderful pleaſant in Converſation; and us'd,
very frequently ſoon after his Reſtauration, to have his private Sallies in
the Winter-Evenings, to divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſome particular Perſons of
Wit, whom he ſtill choſe to Sup with him, where I had the Honour divers
Times, by his Majeſty's Command, to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him at Supper; (for he would
then have none of the Grooms of his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber with him.) In theſe
Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the King permitted thoſe who Supped with him to make uſe
of their Wits in telling ſome pleaſant Stories, and in quick and handſom
Repartees, wherein the King had an excellent Vein, and would as well take as
give without Offence; which Liberty was always us'd with great Reſpect by
thoſe who had the Honour to Sup with him; which were uſually, (<hi>Hannibal
Seſted,</hi> baſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the then King of <hi>Denmark</hi>) the Duke
of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Lords <hi>Carling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Wentworth,</hi> and
<hi>Crofts,</hi> with Sir <hi>Frederick Cornwallis,</hi> Sir <hi>John
Mynnis,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Tom Killigrew.</hi> In theſe
Converſations, I have heard excellent Diſcourſes, witty Repartees,
mingled with pleaſant Tales, wherein the King <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0544000400:95"/> had ſo
great a Faculty, that ſcarce any Thing could be ſaid, which he would not
Parallel with ſome pleaſant modern Story, which He would tell with ſuch
Grace and Quickneſs as charm'd all the Company; but when he found them warmd
with Wine, and that their Wits began to be piquant and ſharp, and to Sting
each other, the King would always then interpoſe his Royal Authority, and
would ſtroak over the ſevere Nips they gave each other, by throwing Duſt
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, telling them, <hi>Good Jeſts ought to bite like Lambs, not Dogs;
to Tickle, not Wound:</hi> Wherein his Majeſty ſhew'd great Prudence, for
we have ſeen in our Days many Examples of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that have hapned
by too ſevere Railleries; in ſuch Fencings Jeſt hath prov'd Earneſt,
and Florets have been turn'd to Swords, and not only the Friendſhip, but the
Men have fallen a Sacrifice to the Jeſt: 'Tis ſure we ſhall die in
Earneſt, and it will not become us always to live in Jeſt; But the Gift of
Raillery in this Age hath devoured the more ſolid Qualifications, and is
accounted the greateſt Accompliſhment; a ſtrange inverted Eſtimate, to
prefer the little Ebullitions of Wit before ſolid Reaſon and Judgment; if
theſe Men <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0544000400:96"/> ſhould accommodate their Diet at the ſame
Rate, they ſhould eat the Husk rather than the Peaſe, and feed upon Froth
and Bubbles.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more becoming a Gentleman than a Cheerfulneſs in
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, every Thing being by ſo much the more lively and cheerful,
as it comes nearer to its Creation, and nothing hath more light and
ſprightfulneſs in it, than an ingenious converſable Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Virtue is
the Mind's conſtant Health, the Pulſe of it ſtill beats true and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
ſhe is ſprightly without Levity, free without Diſcompoſure, and
converſable without Coyneſs or Cheapneſs, as free from Stupidity as
Lightneſs, from being a Log as a Squib. Beſides, a Vivacity of Spirit is
uſually accompanied with ſuch a kind of Wit as makes us accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in
Converſation: Cheerful Perſons being graceful in all they do, are moſt
valuable in Company; For who had not rather aſſociate himſelf with a
Merry conceited Humour, than with a <hi>Cynical</hi> Wiſe Man? Many Men
indeed blame Mirth becauſe they cannot endure it; which is to blame the Sun,
becauſe Owls cannot endure the Brightneſs of it; as if we ſhould Quarrel
with Light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our weak Eyes are dazzled with its Beams.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0544000400:97"/>There are ſome Men whoſe Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
lead them to faſten and feed on Miſeries, and to glide over the
Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this Life; which puts me in Mind of what paſſed betwixt
<hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick, and <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, who
paſſing by <hi>Diogenes</hi> as he was at Dinner in his Tub,
<hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>If you could content your ſelf, as I do,
with Bread and Garlick, you would not be the King of</hi> Syracuſe <hi>his
Slave: And you,</hi> reply'd <hi>Ariſtippus, if you knew how to live with
Princes, you would not make ſuch bad Cheer.</hi> 'Tis true, this moroſe and
pedantick Philoſophy is not deſigned for a Gentleman, they are born to be
Sociable, and ought to underſtand all the Maxims of the World; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant
Humours, aſſiſted with this practical Knowledge, gain the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of all People, becauſe they know how to ſet forth gracefully the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
of Nature.</p>
            <p>There is no Means ſo powerful and appoſite to divert the fixed
and intent Cares of the Mind, and to exhilerate a ſorrowful Heart, as
pleaſant Company and Muſick, which mollifyeth our Minds, and ſtays the
tempeſtuous Affections of it, if there be any Dregs of Cares that lie lurking
in our Thoughts, moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0544000400:98"/> it wipes them all
away. They ſay, <hi>Alexander</hi> one Day excited by the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of a
Harp, took Arms, and plaid the Part of a Common Soldier <hi>David</hi>
himſelf charm'd the Evil Spirit in the Body of his Father-in-Law, by the
Sweetneſs of his Harmony; and we daily ſee the Terror of Death cannot ſo
much affright Soldiers, as the Sound of Drums and Trumpets does animate them;
the Singing of the Nurſe makes the Child quiet; which evidently
demonſtrates the powerful Effects of it in Nature it ſelf; and the very
Labouring Men find Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in it, who Sing in their Work; and without
doubt, the Voice perſuades and inſtructs much more than Reading, the
firſt being accompanied with certain Spirits which we may call Living, the
other is nothing but the Pourtraicture of the Thoughts of a Dead Man.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> in his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> makes Muſick an
Appendix to every Meal; and <hi>Epictetus</hi> eſteems a Table without it to
be no better than a Manger: <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. ſays <hi>Comines,</hi> at the
Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view betwixt him and <hi>Edward</hi> IV. of <hi>England,</hi> invited him
to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> and told him as a great Part of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
that <hi>he ſhould hear moſt ſweet Voices, exquiſite Muſick, and
ſhould not</hi> 
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0544000400:99"/> 
               <hi>want the Company of fine Ladies, and
the Cardinal of</hi> Bourbon <hi>to be his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor</hi>; which he
thought ſufficient En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments to ſuch a ſenſual Prince as
<hi>Edward</hi> IV.</p>
            <p>Indeed, innocent Mirth and pleaſant Company whet out Wits, quicken
our Fancies, and make us afterwards more fit for any Employment: <hi>A merry
Heart is the life of the Fleſh,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon, and Gladneſs
prolongs his Days</hi>; and is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeful, when 'tis only our
Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not our Buſineſs; but the exceſs of it is very
ill-becoming, and to ſet our Wits on the Tenter-hooks for ſo ſlight a
Purpoſe, is abominable: But merry Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, tho' they have a great
Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them, are obnoxious to many, becauſe if Jeſts (wherein
they are moſt converſant) be well receiv'd by ſome, yet they offend more
than they pleaſe, and create more Enemies than Friends: For tho' Points of
Wit be very fine in Diſcourſe, yet if they be made ſo ſharp as to draw
Blood, thoſe that uſe them may have Occaſion to repent of them. 'Tis
true, flaſhes of Wit give us a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Light, ſo long as they burn not;
but this Liberty muſt be bounded with Caution; for Wit ſhould rather
ſerve for a Buckler to defend by a handſome <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0544000400:100"/> Reply,
than a Sword to wound others, tho' with never ſo facetious a Reproach: In
theſe Rencounters therefore the Charge ſhould be Powder and not Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets;
and we muſt take heed, that we paſs not from this familiar Freedom of
Drollery, which cauſes Mirth, to ſevere Scoffing, which provokes Scorn,
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers Quarrels, and gives an Umbrage of a ſpiteful Intent.</p>
            <p>This pleaſant kind of Wit is a Talent uſually given to Youth to
play withal, and it is a pretty Gift to begin the World with, if they
underſtand the right Uſe of it; otherwiſe it is an unruly Engine, wildly
Striking, ſometimes a Friend, and not ſeldom the Engineer himſelf. Sharp
Speeches therefore which fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad like Darts, are to be tenderly us'd; for
tho' they be Shot at others, they are many Times thrown back upon
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: As when the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> who had been
inſtrumental in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment of Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> to be Lord
Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and thinking the Chancellor did not ſhew him
that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he merited, meeting him acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, he told him in Reproach,
<hi>Honores mutant Mores,</hi> alluding to his Name; which the Lord Chancellor
ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd upon him, telling him, <hi>It was</hi> 
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0544000400:101"/> 
               <hi>not true in</hi> Latin, <hi>but in</hi> Engliſh, <hi>That
Honours changed Manners,</hi> which was the Lord <hi>Rutland</hi>'s Sirname.
Thus we ſhall ſee ſome Men's Wits whip Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and manifeſt the
Quickneſs of their Dexterity in the Shapneſs of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, (like the
Artiſans Weapon, that makes his Enemies Arms his Enemies Deſtruction) and
by a nimble Repartee, turns the Words ſpoken upon the Speaker himſelf.
There is much Pleaſure in this kind of Wit, there being no ſuch Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
as a quick Brain, which refines and makes uſe of whatſoever comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Pan for its Reception. But thoſe Gentlemen who have this Satyrical Vein,
and make others afraid of their Wit, had need be afraid of other Men's
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; for many times, after they have given others Occaſion to Laugh,
they are made themſelves to Cry.</p>
            <p>The Rules to be given herein, are carefully to obſerve Times,
Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and Perſons, knowing when to Jeſt, and when not; to uſe
apt and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Repartees, natural and not affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that have more Salt
than Gall, ſpeaking what is juſt and proper upon every Occaſion, which is
better than fine Conceits, which yet are liked, if they be good; but
Equivocations, Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0544000400:102"/> with Words, and Puns, which
have only the appearance of Wit, are ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and yet theſe have brought
ſome Men of very ordinary Parts into Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. There is as much difference
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jeſts pick'd up here and there, and thoſe that come from the
Spring-Head, as betwixt wiſe Diſcourſes, and harmonious Fooleries,
between a ſolid Sufficiency, and what is painted; a Jeſt ſhould never be
ſerv'd up but once, when 'tis Cold the Vigour and Strength of it is gone.
Many refuſe to wear Buff becauſe 'tis laſting, and a Man of Wit will not
Apparel his Brain in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. It is therefore pleaſant to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Jeſt
with Earneſt, for nothing pleaſes more than Variety; and it is a dull Piece
of Service to tire any Thing too far: But as all Creatures by ſecret
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation love to be doing that in which they are moſt able, ſo
theſe Men of Wit being delighted to hear themſelves Talk, cannot contain
themſelves within a Mean, nor have Patience ſometimes to be Silent, ſo
that we may juſtly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch abſurd Perſons ſhould ſpeak ſo
well: Now there are ſome Limits wherein theſe kind of Wits ought to be
circumſcrib'd, there being certain Perſons and Things priviledged from 
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0544000400:103"/> Jeſting, as Religion, Matters of State, great
Perſons, any Man's preſent Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Importance, and any Caſe that
deſerves Pity: To Play upon any Man's Unhappineſs or Deformity, is
inhumane, and Men may be as oppreſſive by their Parts, as by their Power;
and God did no more deſign the meaner Intellectuals of ſome for Triumphs to
the Vanity of the more acute, than he did the Poſſeſſions of the leſs
Powerful, as a Prey to the Avarice and Rapine of the Mighty; and it is a much
greater Barbariſm to reproach a Man that wants the Gifts of Nature, than him
that wants thoſe of Fortune; for a Beggar may have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh'd himſelf
by his own Fault, but in Natural Defects there is nothing to be charged,
unleſs we will arraign that Providence which hath ſo diſpoſed: And
thoſe whom God hath bleſſed with higher Degrees of Sagacity and
Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ought not to look down upon others as Objects of their Contempt
and Scorn, but rather of their Care and Pity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſecure them
from thoſe Miſchiefs to which their Weakneſs may expoſe them, and their
Folly ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſmount our Wiſdom, nor violate our own Integrity:
But the World is grown to that paſs, that Men will rather 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0544000400:104"/> put ſtumbling Blocks in the way of the Blind, and pull
away the Crutch from the Lame, that they may Sport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſee them
Tumble, ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light we take in improving the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of others,
that it's become the great Excellency of this Age to be dextrous at it. But
good Nature is willing to interpret Things to the beſt Senſe, to take
Things by the right Handle, and will never go to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Matter, nor
break out at others Misfortunes; for to be touchy and peeviſh in
diſcovering a Fault, to kindle like Gun-Powder at the leaſt Spark, is a
ſign we are perfectly wrapt up in our own Intereſt, and that we have
nothing of Sweetneſs or Balſom in our Blood. We muſt therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſweeten our Humour, and keep the Ferment down; and tho' the World be full
of malicious Men, yet by this we ſhall diſappoint the Pleaſure of ill
Nature, break the Force of an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, and make the Injury fall upon us like
Hail upon Tiles, rattle without Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and at laſt to tumble into
Dirt.</p>
            <p>To jeſt at Calamities, is a great ſign of ill Nature: When
<hi>Caninius,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul of <hi>Rome,</hi> died the ſame Day he was
made Conſul, <hi>Cicero</hi> would needs put a <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0544000400:105"/> Jeſt
upon that Accident, and ſaid, <hi>O vigilantiſſime Conſul ſub quo
nimo pranſus eſt, nemo caenavit, nemo dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, magnum prodigium vidimus,
Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Conſule, non ſenſimus ver, non eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, non autumnum: The
State,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath had a vigilant Conſul of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninius,
<hi>that never Slept in all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip.</hi> But this was juſtly
thought a Fault in <hi>Cicero,</hi> for Calamities are not to be the Subject of
Jeſts. <hi>I love Jeſts well,</hi> ſaid a Wiſe Man, <hi>but not the
loſs of my Friend</hi>; and thoſe who loſe themſelves to ſhew their
Wit, are much like <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tricca</hi> in
<hi>Theſſaly,</hi> who having wrote the <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Hiſtory ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
politely and elegantly, but withal ſomewhat looſely and wantonly, was
thereupon ſummoned by a Provincial Synod, who told him, His Work did more
endanger the Manners than profit the Wits of his Readers, as nouriſhing
looſe and wanton Conceits in the Heads of Youth; and therefore they gave him
his Choice, either to retract his Book, or leave his Biſhoprick; whereupon he
rather choſe to reſign his Place in the Church, than to loſe the
Reputation of his vain Wit. And every Age ſhews us remarkable Examples of
this Kind; for Sharpneſs of Wit commonly carries <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0544000400:106"/> with
it two ill Companions, Pride and Levity; ingenious Perſons miſcarrying in
nothing more than in too much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves in the Goodneſs of
their own Conceits; where ſometimes the like befalls them, which hapned to
<hi>Xeuxis</hi> the famous Painter, who having pictur'd to the Life an old
Woman, ſo pleas'd himſelf in the Conceit of his Work, that he died with
Laughing at it.</p>
            <p>Being thus prepar'd with outward and inward Furniture for
Converſation, it is neceſſary to conſider how and where to beſtow it;
for he that is provident of his Time, will be alſo Prudent in the Choice of
his Company, and Choice of his Actions, leaſt the firſt engage him in
Vanity, and the latter by being Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, in throwing himſelf and his Time
away.</p>
            <p>This World is link'd together by Love, and Men by Converſation;
and one of the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Pleaſures we enjoy herein, (if duly weighed) is the ſweet Society of
Friends and Relations, which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies our Joys and divides our Griefs; there
being no ſtricter Union upon Earth, than that of a virtuous Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
and nothing can be more Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory than to Improve and Benefit 
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0544000400:107"/> that Perſon who is thus become a Part of us.</p>
            <p>Men of Quality love to deck and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh the Place where their
inhabit, and Friends dwell in each other, and therefore cannot but be delighted
in beautifying and adorning thoſe Minds they have thus choſen to live in,
by purging them from all Foulneſs, and rendring them as ſplendid and
illuſtrious as is poſſible, and certainly there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more
raviſhing than a Friendſhip thus entertain'd: That Calamities at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it as
well as Comforts, is but a weak Objection; for what Goodneſs is there without
Temptations, and what Happineſs in this World not to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: It is
the Gracefulneſs of every Thing that makes it valued; Gold, whilſt it is in
the Mine, is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; when 'tis cut and beaten into the thinneſs of
Leaf-Gold, 'tis waſted and blown away, and quickly comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but
when it is tempered with ſuch an Allay, as it may receive a Stamp and
Impreſſion, then it is Currant and Uſeful.</p>
            <p>Thus Cynical Men, who out of Pride of their own Parts diſdain
Company, and can no more endure Converſation than Owls the Day-Light, like
Gold in <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0544000400:108"/> the Bowels of the Earth, their Parts are
uſeleſs and good for nothing, who cannot without Offence walk the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Ways; they are Saints indeed in private, and live only to God and to
themſelves; but being call'd forth into common Life, they are like Bats in
the Sun, and utterly ignorant of Publick Affairs. And the Converſation and
Friendſhip of thoſe whoſe End is only Civility and mutual Viſits, like
Leaf-Gold they are blown away with every little Wind of Diſtaſte, or
Neglect of Ceremony; and in an equal Degree to theſe are they to be reckon'd,
who are <hi>Amici inter prandium &amp; ſartaginem, ad oſtium tabernae
fratres &amp; amici, ad oſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um carceris neque fratres neque amici:</hi> But
the uſeful and profitable Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which give a right Stamp and
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to our Minds, are thoſe Friends that will be Supporters to us
in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperities, Safeguards in our Difficulties, Counſellors in our
Doubts, and Comforts in our Adverſities. With theſe we ought to contract a
ſtrict Acquaintance and Inwardneſs, and to embrace their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany upon all
fitting Opportunities, uſing herein a wiſe Moderation, which carries with
it both an Honour and Grace of Manners; for to ſeek Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany 
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0544000400:109"/> and to fly it, are two Extreams to be blamed; to ſhun
all Company argues a Contempt of others, and makes us generally hated; and to
ſeek too much after them, is a ſign of Idleneſs in our ſelves, and
makes us ſlighted: We muſt love our Neighbours as our ſelves; and to
ſhew that we love them, we muſt not avoid their Company; and to ſhew that
we love our ſelves, we muſt ſometimes be alone, and take Pleaſure in
our ſelves. The <hi>Italians</hi> have a very ſignificant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, which
ſays, <hi>Meaſure it a hundred Times before you cut it off</hi>; meaning
you ſhould ſtand upon your Guard, till you diſcover the Inclinations of
thoſe you converſe with, and therefore we ſhould be careful of laying out
our Friendſhip too laviſhly at firſt, ſince like other Things it will
be ſo much the ſooner ſpent: Neither ſhould it be of too quick a
Growth, for the Plants which ſhoot up too faſt, are not of that Continuance
as thoſe which take more Time for it: We ſhall ſee ſome who have hot
and cold Fits of Friendſhip, that ſhall hug you one Day, and not know you
the next; this Unevenneſs of Temper is by all Means to be avoided in
Converſation; a good Man will always keep a ſteddy Courſe of
Friendſhip, which may run <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0544000400:110"/> like a ſmooth Stream, and
never change, but be a perpetual Spring; for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find the Guſt and
Reliſh of a true and fixed Converſation, till we come to a great Freedom
with each other; for they that converſe only as Strangers, are always under
ſome Reſtraints and Uneaſineſs, and do never open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves freely
the one to the other.</p>
            <p>In the long Experience I have had in the World, I have ſeldom, if
ever, found any Man's Company worth enjoying, that did not begin with ſome
Difficulty, if not Prejudice; for Converſation, like Oyſters, is nothing
the better for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo eaſie, and ſo ſoon. Neither is there any
more dangerous Acquaintance, than that over-haſty Familiarity contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
betwixt good Fellows, as we call them in <hi>England,</hi> who uſually begin
their Friendſhip in the Entry, and ſtrike it up in the Cellar, where
Servants are diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd to be the Miniſters of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Luxuries,
whoſe Vices ſeldom miſs to be taken up by them, as if they were the
Badges to witneſs to whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed. There is no greater Mark nor
Diſcovery of a Man, than to judge him by the Company he keeps, it being
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that he ſhall much reſemble them, and partake ſome of
their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0544000400:111"/>

<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Problems makes a Queſtion, Why Health does not

Infirmity, never his Health; the Reaſon is, ſays he, becauſe the Health
of the Body hath no tranſient Force on others, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and not
communicative. But <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezzi</hi> tell us, it is, for that Nature in
Providence drives away the Evil from it ſelf, and thriftily reſerves that
which is Good; and for this Reaſon it is, ſays he, that thoſe who have
the Plague are deſirous to come into Company, that they may give it to
others; and by the ſame Reaſon, thoſe who have ill Qualities in them,
will be ſure to work and apply their Vices, like Ruſt, into the neareſt
and pureſt Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> II. of <hi>England</hi> was a ſad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hereof;
for his <hi>alter idem,</hi> his great Favourite <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> was a Man
of <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0544000400:112"/> excellent Parts of Body, and of no leſs Endowments
of Mind, being both va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and witty; and if his Valour could as well have
made the King valiant, as his Riot made him riotous, there might have come
ſome Good of their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Conjunction; but ſeeing Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are but
perſonal, and Vice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative, it made the King not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more Vicious
than he would have been, but Vicious where otherwiſe in all Appearance he
would not have been. The Conſideration of this moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheivous and
dangerous Converſation, cauſed <hi>Seleucus</hi> to make a Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he
forbad all Company with wicked Men. And <hi>Charondas</hi> the Lawgiver
puniſhed thoſe for wicked, who frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lewd Company. Neither was it a
ſufficient Anſwer, which <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> gave, when he was told of
his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with wicked Men, That Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians live amongſt the
Sick; for tho' they help ſick Men's Health, they ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impair their own,
by continual viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and touching diſeaſed Perſons: But yet this
muſt be favourably under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; for there is no Rank or Quality of
Perſons ſo abſolutely excluded from our Converſation, but only ſuch a
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ill Company, as may Poiſon and <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0544000400:113"/> Corrupt the
Good; for in nearer than Company, our Friend, and in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nearer than
him, our ſelves, we muſt allow ſome Inordinaries, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Grains of
Allowance muſt be given to make the beſt of us Currant: There may be
likewiſe Occaſion ſometimes of converſing with ill Men, not for
Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but Buſineſs, and for Reformation, as our Saviour converſt with
Publicans and Sinners. And therefore no Man is ſo tied up, as to come in no
Company but good Men; for he that cannot live amongſt the wicked, muſt
ſeek for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind of World than this, and for more perfect Creatures
than Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals: It was not ill ſaid of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, <hi>Omnes odit qui
malos odit: He that hates ill Men hates all Men:</hi> And if a Man will love
none but honeſt Men, where will he find any Exerciſe, any Object of his
Love? If a Man will hold Friendſhip with none, do Offices of Society to none
but good-natur'd and ſociable Men, he will leave many neceſſary
Buſineſſes undone: The fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt and perverſeſt Man may be good
for ſome particular Occaſion; a crooked Piece of Timber is not thrown
aſide, 'tis good for ſome Uſes; the very Fleſh of a Viper is made an
Antidote, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0544000400:114"/> mingled with other Simples and
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, and by good Company and kind Uſage many an ill Man is better'd.
And ſince a Magiſtrate ceaſes not to be a Magiſtrate for being an ill
Man, much leſs does a Man ceaſe to be a Man, and ſo to have Title to
thoſe Duties of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Buſineſs which are rooted in Nature,
becauſe he is of an ill Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. It is indeed a great Part of
Wiſdom to contract Friendſhip and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs with none but good Men,
that ſo by our Intimacy with them we may participate of their Goodneſs; for
Men are not like Bees, whoſe Sweetneſs makes Things of another Nature
Sweet, it muſt be good we receive, and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we ſhall make it
better, but if ill, we make it worſe.</p>
            <p>Some Naturaliſts ſay, there is a way of Caſtration in cutting
off the Ears, that there are certain Veins behind the Ears, which if cut,
cauſe Barrenneſs; our Ears are the Aqueducts of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and if we cut
thoſe, that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit our Converſation with good and wiſe Men, this
will prove a Caſtration to our Underſtanding. The Advantages we receive
hereby was well intimated, in that which <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid to
<hi>Eſchines,</hi> who ſeeing every Body give <hi>Socrates</hi> 
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0544000400:115"/> ſomething, he ſaid, <hi>Becauſe I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe to give thee, I will give thee my ſelf: Do ſo,</hi> ſays
<hi>Socrates, and I will give thee back again to thy ſelf, better than when I
receiv'd thee:</hi> And certainly the Converſation of well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Men,
who have moſt look'd into the Affairs of the World, and have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Men
as well as Buſineſs, is a great Improvement of our Underſtanding, and
Fortifier of our Judgment, eſpecially if they be Men of Years, Experience,
and Virtue, and fam'd for Wiſdom, for their Teſtimony is of greater Force,
and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is always to be learn'd from them. For where Wiſdom holds
with Age, and Memory hath not unthriftily ſpent her Comings in upon Time,
their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is certainly the wiſeſt Book; there is only one Fault
accompanies them, their great and unwearied Deſire of Talking, which ſeems
troubleſome to many that hear them; yet I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, in my younger
Days, I have ever heard ſuch with Delight, and did at all Times moſt
joyfully accept what they deliver'd, who are of all others moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to
inſtruct Youth; and ſurely there is much Reverence owing that Age, which
deſerves a fatherly Reſpect and Honour from us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0544000400:116"/>A Gentleman in Converſation ſhould be
Affable, not Imperious, knowing Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and Gentleneſs is a common Debt to
Mankind, and therefore will not contract his Civility into ſo narrow a
Compaſs, that it ſhall ſwell into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to them above him, and not
ſuffer one Drop to deſcend on thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath him, but will ſo
diſpoſe its Streams that all Channels may be fill'd with it: But ſome
Gentlemen, like the Phariſee, think they are not like other Men, and having
mounted themſelves aloft, look down upon all below them, as little and
contemptible creeping Things of the Earth; not conſidering that the
diſtance betwixt noble and mean Men, is only valuable, as a Defence againſt
baſe and ignoble Practices, true Greatneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in deſpiſing
not the Perſons, but the Errors of the Vulgar.</p>
            <p>It is great Prudence in Gentlemen to aſſociate themſelves, as
near as may be, with Perſons of their own Rank and Quality; for in ſuch
kind of Friendſhips well choſen, conſiſts the Fruit and Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of
Converſation.</p>
            <p>To keep Company with great Men is very dangerous; and he that
ſoars in ſo high a Sphear, runs the hazard of <hi>Ica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>; for if
great Men love his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0544000400:117"/> it is either for their
Pleaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath Wit, and tickles their Fancy, or he hath Parts
which they make uſe of for their own Advantage; and it is common with them,
never to quit or advance ſuch Perſons, but ſtill feed them with Hopes,
that their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance may be wholly upon them; and when ſuch great Men die
or are diſgraced, their Fall is the Ruin of their Dependants. My Lord
Chancellor <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> wittily reſembles ſuch (who have Intimacy with
and Dependance upon great Men) to Faſting Days, which ſtand next to Holy
Days, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are the Leaneſt Days in the Year. The wiſe
Hiſtorian tells us, <hi>Nunquam ſecura cum potente ſocietas.</hi> The
Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuch Acquaintance is well repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the Fable of the Lion,
the Fox, and the Aſs, who keeping Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany together, they went one Day a
Hunting, where the Lion having taken a great Prey, he bid the Aſs divide the
Spoil, who put all into three equal Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſo much offended the
Lion, that he immediately kill'd the Aſs and devour'd him, and then commanded
the Fox to divide, who put all into one great Heap, and ſet by a little
Morſel for himſelf; and being asked by the <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0544000400:118"/> Lion,
<hi>How he knew ſo wiſely to divide,</hi> anſwer'd well, <hi>The Fortune
of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſs hath taught me:</hi> And if I had as well underſtood the
Moral of this Fable when I learnt it at School, as I did afterwards by
dear-bought Experience, I had not ſtood ſo long in the Aſs's Place; but
<hi>ſero ſapiunt Phryges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are ſome Men ſo far from this Humour, that they always
keep Company with mean Perſons, and thoſe below them; whereas there can be
no true Friendſhip, but betwixt Equals: And therefore wiſe Men will not
only avoid converſing with ſuch who are much Superior, but alſo with
thoſe who are much Inferior, not only in Degree, but in Parts, for <hi>tanti
eris aliis quanti tibi fueris</hi>; and that our Thoughts and Deſigns will be
ſuch as our Companions are, and low Fortunes breed many times degenerous
Purpoſes, and he that makes himſelf an Aſs, invites others to ride him;
and it is a very mean Ambition to be the beſt in the Company, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an
experienced Truth, That he who deſires always to be the beſt Man in the
Company he keeps, ſhall ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the worſt of any Company he comes
into.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0544000400:119"/>And yet this Converſation, tho' bad, is not
ſo dangerous as keeping Company with Fools, Folly being no good Tutor to
teach Wiſdom; neither can a wiſe Man contract Friendſhip with a Fool,
their Qualities being ſo far different: For when any Man is taken with
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Converſation, it is a great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they are both of the
ſame Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, but a Fool ſerves for nothing, but ſometimes to divert
an ingenious Man, and no other uſe can be made of him.</p>
            <p>But thoſe who love Multitudes are in worſe Danger than in
keeping Company with Fools; for ſuch live in a Crowd, and a Herd is not
Company; the very ſmell of them offends a wiſe Man, and where the Crowd of
Men is, there is the Crowd of ill Cuſtoms; and ſince 'tis hard to avoid
Temptations when they come ſingle, How ſhall we eſcape them when they
come upon us in a full Body? How can we think of any thing but Ill, when we
ſee nothing that's Good? Young Gentlemen who are newly come into the World
with great Fortunes and ill Breeding, ſeek great Meetings, and Sin for
Company to gain Experience. And therefore 'tis no wonder they are entangled in
Debts, and made a Prey <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0544000400:120"/> to Cheaters, and embroiled in
Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, ſo long as they frequent ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. It was in ſuch
kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I conceive <hi>Seneca</hi> meant, when he ſaid, <hi>He never
went amongſt Men but he came home a worſe Man that he went out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt wiſe Men, the principal End of Company is Conference,
and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to be better'd by is not uſually met with in Crowds, where
Men meet not like Bees to make Honey, but like Waſps, who love to feed in
Dung; in ſuch Company you ſhall hear Men ſpeak neither honeſtly nor
temperately, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or Flattery ingroſſing all their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſo
that no Man can be better'd by their Converſation, the chattering of Magpyes
being better Muſick than a Conſort of ſuch ſenſeleſs Perſons;
nay, a Deſart is to be preferr'd before ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd Companions, for the
wildneſs of the Place is but unchearful, whilſt the wildneſs of Lewd
Perſons is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there is another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which is that
of Women; and tho' young Gentlemen are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleas'd to think this a very
innocent Diverſion, yet none is more dangerous, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as to the
Woman's Part, and proves <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0544000400:121"/> often a more pernicious Calamity
than that which thruſts Men into Hoſpitals; Such Men as ſpend their whole
Time, like <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> amongſt Women, and yet pretend Chaſtity,
are ridiculous.</p>
            <p>If theſe hear of a beautiful Woman, what Contrivances and
Deſigns do they lay firſt to ſee her, and then to corrupt her, and make
it their great Buſineſs, as well as Trade, for their Agents and Factors to
ſpring ſuch Game; and upon theſe Occaſions, thoſe will liberally
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice all their Time, of which, when any charitable Office would borrow
from them ſome Minutes, they are then ſuch buſie Perſons, they can by
no Means afford it; but to go in queſt of ſuch Game, to have the Company of
Women is their only Delight and Paſtime: But Ladies muſt take heed of
ſuch dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Converſation; and eſpecially by how much the more lively
they are, they are the more liable to be hurt, as the fineſt Plants are the
ſooneſt Nipt by the Froſt.</p>
            <p>The World is a dangerous Stage for Women, where Virtue alone will
not defend them, unleſs join'd with much Prudence; they muſt have both for
their Guard, and not ſtir without them, and all little enough, for the Enemy
being <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0544000400:122"/> abroad, they are ſure to be taken if they be
ſtraggling. Their Behaviour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt ever incline ſtrongly towards
the reſerved Part, the deceitfulneſs of the Age we live in having made this
Caution highly neceſſary: For tho' moſt Men ſeem indeed Plantonick
Lovers, and ſo at firſt as humble Gallants they are only admitted for
Trophies, yet they very often become Conquerors, and from Admirers grow into
Maſters. Beſides, the World is not ſo great a Fool, as not very well to
know, that frequent Viſits made to handſom Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſoon grow Suſpicious,
ſince we know all Men are pleas'd with what is Handſome: <hi>Stimulus
carnis,</hi> is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Vice in all Men, and Luſt is no way better
reſtrain'd, than by keeping far from ſuch Creatures.</p>
            <p>He that will avoid committing Sin, muſt ſhun the Occaſions;
for the beſt Philoſopher cannot make me believe, but that every Man
naturally is pleas'd with a ſavory Morſel: And they that make
Profeſſion of not ſtaining their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Spots of Uncleanneſs,
ought to ſhun all that allures thereunto; for it is not only a great Peice of
Folly, but an infinite Raſhneſs worthy to be puniſhed, to make Gun-Powder
in a <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0544000400:123"/> Smith's Shop, with Hopes to make People believe
there is no Danger in it.</p>
            <p>Some learned Phyſicians affirm, and Anatomiſts do alſo tell
us, When a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bears Twins, if they be both of the ſame Sex, they are
enwrapped in one Film, but if of different, wiſe Nature parts them; And if
Nature thinks not fit to lodge a Brother and Siſter toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſo tender
an Age, this certainly teaches us, that Perſons of different Sexes cannot
live ſafely together; and thoſe who relie upon their Strength and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
in ſuch Occaſions, are certainly more Raſh than Wiſe: And thoſe young
Ladies who promiſe to themſelves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to go ſo far, as to be gain'd,
nor to admit any but indifferent Favours, ſuch as Civility allows; and after
having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Way to more than they ſhould, they find a Precipice, where they
expected only Entertainment: And that Woman who will allow her ſelf to go to
the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Extremity of every Thing that is Lawful, is ſo very near going
farther, that thoſe Gentlemen who lie at Watch, will begin to Count upon her:
For Men are apt to turn every Thing that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man does to the hopeful Side; But
yet few are ſo Impudent as to make an <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0544000400:124"/> Application, till
they ſee ſomething which they are willing to take for an Encouragement.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is much more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ſafer for Women to
prevent ſuch Forwardneſs, than to go about to cure it; nothing being with
more Care to be avoided by them, than ſuch a kind of Civility, which may be
miſtaken for an Invitation</p>
            <p>I wiſh many imprudent Ladies had not found the Truth of this, Men
often ſtealing from little Favours to greater, and ſtill carry on their
Deſigns, till ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Times they change their Intreaties into Threats, and
their Softneſs into Violence; and then thoſe Women find too late, that true
Simplicity is abuſed, when it deals with falſifyed; the fear of loſing
their Reputation, after having given ſome Advantages which they ought not to
have done, hath debauched ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Women, and therefore they ought to be very
cautious what Men they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit into their Company, and of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the leaſt
Civilities. For as the Sun ſhining upon a Looking-Glaſs melting the
Quickſilver, preſently cauſes Spots; ſo if a young Gentleman do but
look upon a beautiful Woman, a Flame of Love preſently ariſes: The ancient
Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0544000400:125"/> knew this well, which made them
preſcribe Abſence for the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Love, that Men ſhould not ſee
their Miſtreſſes: But ſhe knew it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who ſaid to her Lover,
<hi>Diſcede, diſcede, a foculo meo, nam ſi te vel mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimè,
igniculus meus afflaverit, ureris infimé.</hi> And what
<hi>Propertius</hi> ſays is moſt true: 
<q> 
                  <l>Creſcit enim aſſiduè ſpectando cura puellae,</l> 
                  <l>Ipſe alimenta ſibi maxima praebet amor.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt Place, there are ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations which are
neither good nor bad, profitable for nothing, but only Recreation, Men who
ſeem as it were made for no other Purpoſe but to divert from ſerious
Affairs: And ſince even Saints themſelves have had their Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements,
and that all Perſons are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd ſome Breathing-time of humane Delight, we
may therefore ſafely ſpare theſe Men that Leiſure, which is ſet
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for our Converſation, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lend our ſelves to them, that
we may be the better enabled to return to our ſerious Employments.</p>

ſo that to unbend our Thoughts, when they are too much ſtretched by our

            <p>Indeed, the Fruit we gather from our many Days of Company is very

for the few Hours we ſpend in Retirement and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection the Return is very

be ſeen, all Things being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that can diſturb: But ſince this
ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Employment and Entertainment of our Selves, is either one of the
beſt or the worſt Things we can undertake; it muſt not therefore be in
Vanity, much leſs in any Thing that is Vicious, but in Study, in profound
Knowledge, and in the diligent Culture of our Minds.</p>
            <p>He that will withdraw himſelf, muſt firſt prepare to receive
himſelf: It is not Wiſdom to let the Spleen govern us, to over-drive Nature
is to draw a Blemiſh upon our Judgment; Men that retire ſhould firſt
examine the Difficulty of the Enterprize, for without this preliminary
Prudence, a Man may over-burthen his Shoulders, and ſoon wade out of Depth.
And tho' Solitude promiſes fair, and is a ſtrong Engagement to a retired
Perſon, yet it is to many better in Proſpect than in Poſſeſſion: It
is a great Folly to truſt our ſelves if we cannot govern our ſelves, and
he had need be very well aſſur'd of <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0544000400:129"/> himſelf, that
falls into his own Hands, for it often happens, that none are more dangerous
than our own; and therefore wiſely ſays the <hi>Spaniard, God keep me from
my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Man is much miſtaken, who thinks Solitude a Sanctuary
againſt all Vices: It is good againſt ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from without us,
but it hath its inward and ſpiritual Difficulties. And tho' the Devil be
buſie in all Places, yet he takes Solitude to be his Ground of Advantage,
from whence oft-times he plays his Batteries with moſt Succeſs. Thus we
ſee he ventur'd to attack our Saviour himſelf, when he found him in the
Wilderneſs, to ſhew it is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for thoſe to be alone that
are not Maſters of themſelves; there being no Security from Danger by
running away from the World, eſpecially if Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly drives us to Solitude,
which makes the Mind uneaſie, and ill Thoughts are no Foreign Commodity, but
purely of our own Growth, which are moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in Solitude; for many
Men, who have well preſerv'd themſelves in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, have been loſt in
Solitude. <hi>Lot</hi> was Chaſte even in the City of <hi>Sodom,</hi> yet
defiled in his Cave. To an Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unadviſed Man Solitude is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous 
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0544000400:130"/> Staff; and it's to be fear'd, that whilſt he Walks
alone, he entertains more and worſe Company than himſelf, Mens Vices many
times giving them the Taſte of Solitude, making them ſo much ſhun Company
and ſeek the more Elbow-Room. For a Man may as well fail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone as in
Company, there are ways for it, until ſuch time that he hath fram'd himſelf
ſuch, as to become <hi>Sibi Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,</hi> that he ſo much reſpects his
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and fears his Conſcience, that he cannot without Shame ſtumble or
trip in their Preſence, that he dare not halt before himſelf, but bears a
kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Reſpect unto himſelf, which next to Religion is the
chiefeſt Bridle againſt all Vice. <hi>Cicero</hi> in this Caſe gives an
excellent Direction, <hi>Obſerven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ſpecies honeſtae animo: Let
honeſt Ideas ſtill repreſent themſelves before our Mind. Let us,</hi>
ſays <hi>Seneca, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> Cato, Phocion, <hi>and</hi> Ariſtides,
<hi>to our Imagination,</hi> (in whoſe Preſence even Fools would hide their
Faults) <hi>and eſtabliſh them as Comptrollers of all our Actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is certainly a rare Thing, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſatis ſe quiſque
vereatur; That every Man ſhould ſufficiently ſtand in Awe of
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> We ſhould win ſo much upon our <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0544000400:131"/>
ſelves, as to be able in good Earneſt, and willingly to be left alone, to
quit the World if need be, to dwell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in our ſelves: We muſt
break thoſe Bonds aſunder that faſten and bind us to each other; and not
ſo tie our ſelves to the Things of this World, that our Felicity depend
upon them, but reſerve a Store-houſe for our ſelves, (what need ſoever
happen) wherein we may ſecure and eſtabliſh our true Contentment and
principal Retreat. This Store-houſe is a wiſe Man's Mind, which moves and
turns within it ſelf, and is well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to keep it ſelf Company, and
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it ſelf: And when the World frowns upon us, and that we are barren of
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, we ought then to betake our ſelves to the ſecret Improver of
Minds, Contemplation, thereby adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Houſe within, and make it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
if for Gueſts that is for Buſineſs, and if they come not, 'tis no matter,
it will be the better for us to live in. Thus we muſt bring home our
Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to our ſelves, that our Contentment may depend upon what is
within us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeking nor diſdaining Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but cheerfully go
on either with or without it, with a calm and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed Mind. For this
World is a <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0544000400:132"/> Comedy, where every Man acts that Part which
Providence hath aſſigned him; and as it is eſteemed more Noble to look on
than to act, ſo there is no ſecurer Box from which to behold it, than a
ſafe Retreat, it being eaſier to feel than expreſs the Pleaſure that
may be taken in ſtanding aloof off, and in contemplating the Reelings of the
Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude upon the Stage of this World.</p>
            <p>There is no Counſel more proper for Men than the Philoſopher's,
<hi>Tecum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite,</hi> to dwell at Home, and not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any Thing to
ſteal us away from our ſelves; there is neither Profit nor Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
worth ſo much, that we ſhould go abroad to ſeek it. Even amongſt
<hi>Pagans</hi> the wiſeſt look'd upon the Things of this World as Lumber
rather than Furniture, as Things which they needed not, and retired within
their own Breaſts, which they call'd their Home, there to enjoy Virtue their
only Good: And many of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Sect (who propos'd to
themſelves no other End but their own Contentment) did bereave themſelves
of all ſenſual Delights, and contemn'd the Glory and Pomp of all worldly
Wealth and Greatneſs, for the only Pleaſure of Contemplation. But now a
wiſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that may within his own Breaſt <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0544000400:133"/>
enjoy both Virtue and God himſelf, hath much higher Advantages, and more
Reaſon to keep within that Home, and to look upon Things without with an
indifferent Eye. That Man therefore forgets his Origin and his Dignity, that
puts his Soul out of Poſſeſſion of her ſelf, by running perpetually
after Hopes that fly from him; whereas he ſhould aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Pleaſures of
this Life, and bid adieu to all manner of Vanities, ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all
Paſſions that may any way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the Tranquility either of Mind or Body,
making God the only Object of his Contemplation: He that thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, draws
no Man's Envy upon him, he reigns by himſelf, and all the Pomp which
Greatneſs draws after it, is not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that which he enjoys in
Secret; for as that Man muſt needs be accounted moſt Happy, that is
likeſt unto God; ſo Man's chiefeſt Happineſs muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in the Contemplation of his Divine Majeſty and of his Works. And indeed,
nothing but the Supports of Religion, and a Spiritual Retreat, upon that ſole
Account, can make a Man fit to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf, withdrawing upon the Score
of Religion. Thus to ſhut up the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this World, that we may take
the better View of the other, is a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0544000400:134"/> Precaution:
Thus we untwiſt our Affections, and ſlide off from the World, before the
World ſlips from us; thus to retire is the beſt Improvement of Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and to be thus Alone is the way to bring us to the moſt deſireable
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>To Retire for Quiet and Thinking is commendable, <hi>Amici fures
Temporis,</hi> ſays the Lord <hi>Bacon.</hi> Converſation is a Thief that
ſteals away a great Part of our Time, and uſually ſtuffs our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with
Rubbiſh; Solitude is a great Relief in ſuch Caſes, and wiſe Men are
glad to get clear of the Crowd for freſh Air and Breathing. It is not Noiſe
and Flaſhes, Thunder and Lightning, that make fair Days, but it is the Sun's
caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a clear and pleaſing Light, with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Gales; ſo a Life led in
ſweet Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity (which is the work of Reaſon) is much preferable before
all the great Succeſſes which the World admires, and which are nothing but
the Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Fortune: In Retirement, we taſte the Sweet of a quiet
Repoſe, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our ſelves with Freedom; nay, we live more in two
Days of Retreat, and we are more ſenſible of what Life is, than in two
Years full of Buſineſs and Trouble, and we ſee greater Things in 
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0544000400:135"/> Retirement than abroad in the World: For what do we ſee
great in the World, unleſs it be perhaps an Army, the Siege of a Town, or the
Court of a Prince? We are quickly accuſtom'd to theſe, which only appear
great to us at the firſt Sight. But in Retirement, we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the
different Works of Nature, the Sun riſing and ſetting, a ſtill Night, and
thoſe Planets which ſo majeſtically Roul over our Heads, which we
continually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire. It is obſerv'd by learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, that thoſe
who dwell fartheſt from the Sun, (if in any convenient Diſtance) have
longer Life, better Appetites, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion and Growth, than others who dwell
not ſo remote from the Heats thereof; Such Advantages, and much greater, have
their Minds, who are well removed from the Scorchings, the Daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zlings and
Exhalings of the World's Glory, into a private Retirement: Whereas thoſe who
live in the Throng of Buſineſs and Company, their Minds loſe their Reſt
and Tranquility, and many times after a Man hath loſt his Reſt, he loſeth
his Labour alſo.</p>
            <p>It is a great Miſery for a Man never to be his own; too much
Acquaintance makes us Strangers to our ſelves; the more we converſe with
Men, the leſs <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0544000400:136"/> we converſe with God, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
which we may expect by our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with Men, is loſt by too much
Converſation. I know Society is one of thoſe Satisfactions which are
reckon'd amongſt the Pleaſures of the firſt Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude in this Life; but
when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the Advantage of Society con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in ſeeing
each other, but in rational Converſation, it will appear, that Solitude is
much more Satisfactory; for what Pleaſure can be receiv'd in talking of new
Faſhions, of great Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes, of Advancement or Ruin of Favourites,
Victories, or Defeats of ſtranger Princes and Armies, ſome of which are the
uſual Subject of ordinary Converſation; and in Courts and great Cities, Men
neither ſeek nor find any other Divertiſement, than viſiting each other,
reviewing their Habits, talking of new Faſhions, or of the Weather, or ſome
ſuch pitiful Stuffs; and if Men diſcourſe upon more ſerious Subjects,
they are ſure to be contradicted, which often cauſes Quarrels. Beſides,
in theſe Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Men are tempted to betray their Ignorance, or their
Malice, in either of which they are eſteem'd Blockheads or Quarrelſom: And
if we converſe with thoſe who ſpeak with more Addreſs than 
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0544000400:137"/> our ſelves, we repine at our own Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and envy
their Acuteneſs; and if we converſe with Duller than our ſelves, we are
ſoon weary, and fret at our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ill Company: And if by chance we
accompany our Equals, then we are upon our Guard, to catch all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
that we may be thought more knowing; and we are ſo intereſted in this Point
of Honour, that ſuch Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation rather vexes than recreates, and many
Perſons make themſelves cheap upon theſe Occaſions, whom we had highly
valued if we had frequented them leſs.</p>
            <p>That Man who dwells upon himſelf, and is always converſant with
himſelf, reſts in his true and proper Center; and therefore he that hath
learnt Wiſdom from the Folly of others, and the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of his own
Actions, will be content to ſee the Crowd afar off, and not any more thruſt
into it, but retire within himſelf: It is true indeed, there is no Place but
there are means in it to do Well or Ill; a Man may live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the Throng of
a Palace, but if he may chuſe he will avoid the Sight of it: If need require,
he will endure the Court, but if he may have his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, he will be alone;
for Contagion <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0544000400:138"/> is catching in a Throng, and a Man muſt
either imitate the Vicious or hate them, and both are dangerous: He that is
care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to avoid Occaſions, ſtarves his Sin; thoſe are rare Men that can
live in the midſt of Temptations and not fall: <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo diu tutus periculo
proximus, &amp; quae licita, ſunt ritanda, propter vicinitatem
illiciti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have never greater Cauſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult our beſt Wits, what we
are to do, and how we are to carry our ſelves, than when Preferment or
Publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are offered us. It was no idle Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion asked by an
eminent Man, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if great Places or Employments were offered us, we
ſhould refuſe or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them? wherein the divers Abilities of Men are to be
conſidered: He that hath Strength and Wiſdom to manage ſuch Places may
receive them; but he that would live quietly ought not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle himſelf
with more than he can manage; let him try, <hi>Quid ferre recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, quid
valeant humeri</hi>; the ſtrong and virtuous Man may poſſibly meet and
encounter Temptations with Advantage, which the more cautelous will avoid; and
in one of theſe two Ranks every good Man is found; and we may well compare
them to <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Fabius,</hi> 
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0544000400:139"/> the
firſt always calling for Battle, the other evermore declining it.</p>
            <p>There are indeed ſeveral Degrees of Solitude, and thoſe wiſely
retire, who being harraſſed with the Fatigues of a Publick Life,
foreſeeing ill Weather, are willing to put into Port, when keeping out at Sea
might endanger the Veſſel: When the Winds go croſs, 'tis Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to
furl the Sails: Thus that great Prince <hi>Charles</hi> V. when he found his
Succeſs began to fail him, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdrew.</p>
            <p>To be able to check our Enemy, to encounter Occaſions, to act our
Part upon the common Stage of this Life, and yet to keep our ſelves Upright,
this is indeed truly to live; but to avoid Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to overcome the World
by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring from it, argues a wiſe, tho' in the World's Opinion, a weak and
faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, who think there is no greater Argument of Imperfection in a
good Man, <hi>Quàm non poſſe pati ſolem, non multitudinem,</hi>
not to be able to appear in Publick without Offence, and who can only live to
God and himſelf, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilis ipſe ſibi, fortaſſis inutilis
orbi:</hi> Tho' this indeed be the weaker Side, yet certainly it is the
ſafer, rather than by an improvident Fool-hardineſs, to 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0544000400:140"/> thruſt our ſelves upon Occaſions, which we are
unable to manage without Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>There is not amongſt Men a greater or more frequent Error
committed than in this Kind; for in moſt Things of this World, Men that have
no Skill in them, will be content to acknowledge their Ignorance, to give Place
to better Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and will adviſe and conſult with every one in their
proper Myſtery; but let Offer be made of Places of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Money or
Preferment, no Man will excuſe himſelf, or acknowledge his Ignorance or
Weakneſs to manage them; whereas our Errors are no where ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as
in the unskillful managing of theſe Things; and therefore it is better to be
cautious and wary, than ſtrong and hardy: <hi>Malo cautior eſſe quam
fortior, fortis ſaepe captus eſt, cautus rariſſimè:</hi> We read
in Holy Scripture of a Race of Men ſo much greater in Bulk than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
that Men of common Size ſeem'd but as Graſhoppers to them; yet we find the
little Men were always too hard for them, and drove them out; becauſe the
Gyants depended upon the Opinion of their Strength and Hardineſs, the others
upon their wary Wit and Policy; and it commonly happens ſo in this World, 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0544000400:141"/> and we ſhall find that far more have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by
unadviſedly venturing upon the Things of this World, than by ſober and
diſcreet Retiring.</p>
            <p>But many Men over-rate themſelves, whoſe Expectations being
great, when they are not careſs'd and humour'd in their Folly, they
preſently grow chagrin and ſick of the World, and fall into a Fit of
Retirement and Melancholy, and will keep no longer Company with any. Theſe
Men, like Children when croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, grow ſullen in a Corner; but he that
thus ſhuns Company and retreats, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires only like a Beaſt to his Den.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen many Examples, where Greatneſs hath ruin'd
ſeveral Perſons, who liv'd with much Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation before.
<hi>Nero, Tiberius,</hi> and ſome others, enjoy'd the Repute of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Souls
before their mounting the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Throne, which brought them new Vices with
their Honours, and made them as much ſurpaſs others in their Debauches, as
they did in their Power; ſo that Publick Employment is ſcarce to be
wiſhed for, ſeeing Men are tempted thereby to commit the greateſt Crimes.
<hi>Moſes,</hi> who was the Meekeſt of Men, whilſt he lived in the
Wilderneſs; yet when Providence advanced him, he ſo <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0544000400:142"/>
highly offended God, that all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Services could not obtain the
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his entring into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' at the Creation God found it not good for Man to be alone,
and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave him a Companion; yet to ſhew the Hazard of being in
Company, even <hi>Adam</hi> could not live one Day in it, and be Innocent; for
the firſt News we hear of him after <hi>Eve</hi> was aſſociate with him,
is, That he had forfeited his Native Purity.</p>
            <p>When God intended to converſe with <hi>Moſes,</hi> he call'd him
from the populous Camp to the Top of Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>; and Chriſt did not
diſcloſe the Glories of his Transfiguration at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but on
the Top of the Mount of <hi>Olives:</hi> When God did diſcipline his beloved,
yet rebellious People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he choſe firſt the
Wilderneſs, then the two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities to be his School.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory tells us of many, who out of their Skill and Strength have
given free Entertainment to the World, and have made large uſe of it, in all
ways of Greatneſs and Expence, when their Time and Hour came, would rather
have gone out of ſome poor Cottage, than out of a Princely Palace, and lived
with no <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0544000400:143"/> Noiſe in the World, that ſo they might have
died in Peace: <hi>Charles</hi> V. the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and ſundry
others, tho' they liv'd in all Pomp and State, yet at their Death they
deſired to be buried in a Capuchin's Habit; and if they thought, to die in a
State of perfect Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration from the World was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, how much
more available had it been to live in it? For thus to die, not having thus
liv'd, is nothing elſe but to give Sentence againſt their own Life; for we
ſhall not appear before God as we died, but as we liv'd; to profeſs
Deſertion of the World at one's Death, as moſt do, is only to be buried in
a Capuchin's Hood.</p>
            <p>It was a notable Anſwer given by the Philoſopher to
<hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who when he told him, <hi>He would Conquer</hi> Greece,
<hi>then</hi> Rome, <hi>and ſo all the World: Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> ask'd him, <hi>Why
he would give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much Trouble</hi>; to which <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi>
anſwer'd, <hi>He would do it, that he might afterwards live happily and
mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily with his Friends</hi>; but <hi>Cyneas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd ſharply, <hi>He
might live ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and not take ſo much Pains for it.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0544000400:144"/>Men that are ſtill buſied in Publick
Affairs, whoſe Mercurial Genius inclines them to a reſtleſs Life, they
(like <hi>Moſes</hi> on <hi>Piſgah</hi>) ſee Retirement, their Land of
<hi>Canaan</hi> afar off, but without Hopes of Enjoyment: And we have ſeen
ſome great Men, who would never leave Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments till outed of them, like
Whales and other great Fiſhes that never come on Shoar till they are wounded,
and then theſe Men have prais'd Retirement, not to ſatisfie their Reaſon,
but their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; yet even this Proceeding of theirs commends Retirement,
ſince even the diſtreſſed expect a Protection there, for Diſtreſs
makes Men run where they may expect Help: And certainly thoſe, who after
poſſeſſing great Places in Courts, have been unexpectedly diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
will be more really convinced of its Slipperineſs, than ſuch as never found
the Effects of ſo much Revolution: Nay, thoſe Men who ſeek greedily after
Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employments, pretend thereby a Deſign for Solitude. Thus Merchants
ſeek about the World, that they may gain ſo much as may afford them the
Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of a Retirement: And Soldiers have often nothing to ſweeten
their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xieties, but the remote Proſpect of ſome good Garriſon for a
Retreat. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> 
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0544000400:145"/> himſelf ſaid,
<hi>Aliquando mihi licebit mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi vivere, He would have his ſpare Hours,</hi>
eſteeming that Part of his Life to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to others, which was ſpent on
other Men's Employments.</p>
            <p>Now the wonder is, that the ſame Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe which hurries Men to
deſire to be Great that they may be Maſters, ſhould not with far more
Reaſon carry them to be Solitary, where they are free from thoſe
Neceſſities, and have none to obey but God and Nature, Maſters who
command us nothing but what were fit for us to do, tho' we were not
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration hath made many Holy Fathers retire into
Deſarts (where they ſcarce had any other Nouriſhment but their own Juice,
nor any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany but God) that they might tend the Work of their
Salvation without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance: There they did as it were deſcend into
their Sepulchers by deep and holy Meditation; and from thoſe Hermitages
inriched the Treaſure of the Church, with their Divine Works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
Gain-ſayers, and increaſing the Stock of Holy Learning.</p>
            <p>But it hath not been unuſual for ſome Men to retire from the
World, and yet look back at it, as <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife at <hi>Sodom,</hi> 
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0544000400:146"/> and oftentimes to keep their Hearts in it: Thus did many
of the Philoſophers who left the World in Effect, but not in Affection; for
in their Retirements they had nothing but their Arms and Legs out of the
Throng, their Minds and Intents were ſtill engaged, and they only went back
that they might leap the better, and with a ſtronger Motion make a nimbler
Offer again into the World: Theſe Men did not take the right way, they
thought they had total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken leave of all Buſineſs, that they might live
at more Leiſure and greater Eaſe; but they miſtook themſelves, and only
exchanged one Employment for another; for tho' they had ſhaken off the Court
and Publick Employments, they had not taken leave of the principal Vexations of
Life, nor had diſcharged themſelves nor their Minds of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens which
oppreſſed them; they had not ſo ordered it, that their Contentment
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended wholly upon themſelves, and that they could live alone in good
earneſt, and at Eaſe: However, Men may converſe with the World, and yet
leave it; we may find Retiredneſs in the greateſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we may paſs
thro' a Crowd and not mingle with it; and we may enjoy our ſelves in a
multitude of unknown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0544000400:147"/> as if they were the
Perſonages of an <hi>Arras</hi> Hanging.</p>
            <p>Every Ship that ſails muſt needs have ſome Part of the Ship
under Water; every Man that lives in this World muſt have ſome of his
Labours ſpent upon the World; but as that part of the Ship by which a Man
ſails is above the Water, ſo that part of us which is above the Earth, we
muſt remove it from the World. Thus ſome who have attain'd to that
Sublimity of Mind, as to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all worldly Cares, tho' they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with
the World as being of the World, yet they do it ſo ſafely, that they cleave
not to it, nor are aſtoniſhed to leave it.</p>
            <p>Thus many great Men, after the Fruition of all Earthly Honours, have
much preferr'd Solitude; As <hi>Snatocopias</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
after the Loſs of a Battle againſt the Emperor <hi>Arnold,</hi> he retired
into a Deſart, where having lived ſeveral Years with three poor Hermits, he
at his Death told them, <hi>There was no Greatneſs preferrable to the
Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of that Solitude he had injoy'd with them, which he eſteem'd as
true Happineſs; whereas that Life he had led upon his Throne deſerv'd more
the Title of Death than Life:</hi> And <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> 
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0544000400:148"/>
a great General to the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> after all his Honours and
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, retir'd into the Country for ſeven Years before his Death, and
caus'd this Epitaph to be written upon his Tomb: <hi>Here lies</hi> Similis
<hi>of a very great Age, who yet lived but ſeven Years</hi>; rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only
to the Time of his Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>It was nobly obſerv'd by that great Emperor <hi>Marcus
Aurelius,</hi> who was alſo a Philoſopher, That a Weaver or a Cobler would
willingly ſequeſter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all Company, that they might
proſecute their ſeveral Trades; and yet Man cannot retire himſelf that he
may admire the Creation, and exerciſe his own Soul, which is the great Trade
of a rational Creature, and of a true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher: And ſince Gain can
prevail ſo far with Men, as to make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Society, and eſteem
Company an idle Folly, why ſhould not we reflect upon the great Advantages of
Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both as to Morality and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are much preferrable to
thoſe Things which are in themſelves but Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles if not Burthens. For
certainly So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude hath more Pleaſures in it, than any Publick Employment,
for it drives us into Contemplation, which is ſo charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0544000400:149"/> that it may rather be ſaid to raviſh than pleaſe,
committing ſo open a Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon our Souls, that it puts them almoſt into
a State of Separation.</p>
            <p>Thus the old Hermits, Members of the Catholick Church, are often
remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for being as far tranſported out of themſelves, as they had
formerly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported themſelves out of the World: And even amongſt the
Heathens, we find <hi>Pythagoras</hi> almoſt diſtracted with the
Satisfaction he conceiv'd in finding out his Demonſtrations: And
<hi>Pliny</hi> was ſo delighted with the Pleaſure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the
Rarities of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> as for farther Inquiry he
approach'd ſo near, that he loſt himſelf in the Flames of it.</p>
            <p>What Calmneſs and Contentment did <hi>Archimedes</hi> ſhew in
the midſt of the Ruins of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> being ſo pleas'd with his
Demonſtration, and ſo buſie about his Knowledge and Contemplation, as he
heard not the Noiſe and Clamours of the Enemy, and could not ſpare ſo
much Time from his Intendment, as to ask Life from the rude Conquerors, when he
was interrupted and kill'd by them. Here was a Tranquility which look'd
gloriouſly thro' Danger and Death: It is not Pomp and ſhining Robes that 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0544000400:150"/> give Grace to the Body, but it is the Mind within the
Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socrates,</hi> that great Maſter of Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tells us, That
young Men ſhould be inſtructed, Men in the Flower of their Age exercis'd in
well-doing; but old Men ſhould withdraw themſelves, and retire from all
worldly Affairs: It being no leſs than highly neceſſary, that a ſpace
of Time ſhould be interpos'd, between the Buſineſs of Life, and the Day
of Death, that when they come to leave the World, they may have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe
to do but to Die. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath laid up in his Mind where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to
entertain himſelf in the Shadow and Retirement of his Age, will look upon
that temperate Climate of his Time as the moſt ſweetned and digeſted part
of his whole Life, free from the Hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of all the other, he then treats
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the beſt Company, that of his own Thoughts and
Obſervations; and with the Philoſopher, when others are ſorry he is grown
Old, he is only ſorry that he was ever Young. Indeed, when Decrepitneſs
kills Experience, when Age acts the Prologue to Death, and draws the Curtains
before our Senſes, it is then high time to give that Life leave to think only
of Death, and to prepare for its <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0544000400:151"/> laſt Journey: For it
is a Right and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice Men owe themſelves, who have given their moſt
active and flouriſhing Age to the World, to give their declining Age to
Solitude and Retirement, and ſince they have liv'd long enough for others,
they ought to give the Remainder of their Lives to themſelves to call in
theſe Thoughts and Intentions; and ſince God gives them leiſure to
prepare for and order their Remove, they ought to make themſelves ready, to
diſintangle themſelves from their worldly Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſince they
have hitherto liv'd Swimming and Floating, they ſhould come now, and Die in
the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; it being but reaſonable for that Man to ſhake off Society
that can bring nothing to it; he that cannot Lend, let him take heed of
Borrowing; and when our Forces fail us, it is then a part of Prudence, as well
as Safety, to retire. But for Men in the Strength of their Manly Vigour, that
are endowed with publick Abilities, and excellent Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the uſe whereof
is only in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, for ſuch to retire for their Eaſe or Idleneſs, and
to do good to none but themſelves, is very injurious to the Publick, and
reſiſts not only Reaſon but Goodneſs, both which join in guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0544000400:152"/> us to common Good. A Man of excellent Parts, who thus
retires under Pretence of meditating, and leaves no Fruit of his Meditations to
the World, is like the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> whoſe fair and quick Water
is loſt in the Lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> call'd the <hi>Dead Sea.</hi> This is
to Die living, to loſe the Quickneſs of the Mind in the Gulph of
unprofitable Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; it is indeed leaving the World in the worſe
Senſe, for it is a forſaking Mankind, and denying to Society that Service
and Duty which we owe it.</p>
            <p>For if Men of Publick Employments and Profeſſions ſhould
husband all their Time ſo thriftily, as not to give any Part thereof to
Buſineſs, but beſtow it all in Retiredneſs, yet even thereby they would
contract a Guiltineſs: As the Eagle were very unnatural, if (becauſe ſhe
is able to do it) ſhe ſhould pearch a whole Day upon a Tree, ſtaring in
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Glory and Majeſty of the Sun, and in the mean time let
her young Eaglets ſtarve in their Neſt.</p>
            <p>Both ancient and modern Hiſtories have furniſh'd us with
Examples of ſome Kings, who have willingly reſigned their Kingdoms, and
depoſed themſelves; but whether they did this meerly out of a Deſire to
live retiredly, or to ſatisfie <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0544000400:153"/> their Sons being
arrived at Years fitting to Rule, that ſo they might ſee the
Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſettled in their own Blood, or to ſhun the Tumults of
Rebellion, or out of Fear of ſome potent Enemy, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptneſs of
Government, are great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions left as yet undecided in the World. But if
any Prince hath done ſo gallant an Action, (which is ſo ſtrongly
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by human Nature) as to renounce a Kingdom, by Virtue of a Soul
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured of that Felicity which is injoy'd in a private Life, and that out of
a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed Mind he preferr'd the Peace of Retirement before the
Hazards and Trouble of Reigning, and that diveſted himſelf of his
proſperous earthly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, purely that he might be Happy, that Prince was
not only truly Wiſe, but was undoubtedly more bound to God for giving him
that Power, and that Performance, than for making him a King. But that King who
ſhrunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of Government, where Men ought to ſhew the
greateſt Worth, or hath renounced his Kingdom out of Poorneſs of Spirit,
that Prince is much to be blamed, for that the true Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Soul is
ſeen in gallantly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Caſes of Adverſity, and not in loſing a
Man's ſelf in Proſperity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0544000400:154"/>Indeed, Prudent Men, that know themſelves
not able to withſtand the Temptations of the World, will wiſely and timely
retire from it: Staggs, when they find themſelves too fat, are ſaid to
retire for Safety to the Woods and Thickets, knowing that being burthen'd with
their own Weight, they are not able to run if they ſhould be hunted; which,
if true, ſhews a great Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Nature. And if we ſeriouſly
conſider, we ſhall find that Multitude and Abundance are far more
troubleſom, than Solitarineſs and Want; in Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, there is only
need of one Duty, but in the conduct and uſe of many Things divers Duties are
required. Thus the Calling of a King or Prelate, is far more difficult than
that of a Monk or Hermit, and the Sociable Life is much harder than the
Solitary, by how much it is more eaſie for a Man to live altogether without a
Wife, than in all Points duly to live and maintain himſelf with her; and
therefore Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> a very ingenious Man, was us'd to
ſay, <hi>That next to no Wife, a good Wife was beſt:</hi> For he that hath
Wife and Children, Servants, Eſtate, and Buſineſs, hath without
compariſon a more troubleſom Task, than he that <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0544000400:155"/> hath
none of all theſe, and hath only to do with himſelf: <hi>Facilius eſt
domi la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere, quam foris ſe poſſe ſufficienter cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodire:</hi> And
therefore Speculative ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Men do diſcreetly and piouſly, that leave
the Employments of the World which require the whole Man, to give themſelves
ſome Intervals to the Office of Men, as they are Men and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>Such Retreats as theſe are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, where Men
ſequeſter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Troubles of the World, that they may the
better <hi>vacare Deo &amp; ſtudiis:</hi> For thus they do more good living
out of the World than in it; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do ſuch Men as theſe embrace
So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude out of meanneſs of Spirit, or for weakneſs of Parts, as not fit
to attain Greatneſs, or not able to bear with the World, but they do it
purely, that they may arrive at that Happineſs which is uſually injoy'd in
a retired virtuous Life.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory affords us many Examples of Men, who have known how to
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the Prime Places and Supream Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities both in Church and State,
who have had the Acquiſition of Wealth and Greatneſs in their Power, tho'
not in their Aim, and who have with much <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0544000400:156"/> Honour
relinquiſh'd Riches to embrace Poverty, and to enjoy Solitarineſs and
Retirement, having voluntarily left the moſt gainful and weighty Employments,
and after a full Fruition of all earthly Happineſs and Pleaſure, have taken
a ſolemn Leave of the World, whilſt yet Fortune ſmil'd upon them. A great
Example in this kind, was <hi>Quintus Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Poſthumius,</hi> that Noble
<hi>Roman,</hi> who having been taken from the Plow to be Conſul, after he
had govern'd that People and conquer'd their Enemies, he return'd to his former
Employment; and being ready to leave the Senate, he called for his Balance, and
by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Faſces, the Mark of his Office or Authority in one Scale, and
his Plow in the other, did let the Senators ſee, thoſe Imperial Enſigns
were far the lighter, and ſo took his leave of the Senate, and return'd to
his Plow. Such Men as theſe are truly Happy, who have left Cares and Troubles
for Calmneſs and Quiet, they poſſeſs a Happineſs, which Kings can
neither keep themſelves, nor ſuffer amongſt their Neighbours; Theſe are
ſo far from complaining of the World, that they are content to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it,
and are reſolved neither to have War nor Commerce with it, having 
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0544000400:157"/> founded a Retreat to all their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well
the pleaſing, as the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom.</p>
            <p>But we ſhall find few Men that will be content to do this Thing
ſeriouſly; ſudden Wiſhes and indeliberate Proffers and Attempts to
renounce the World are but raſh Pangs of ſeeming Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. There are
not many that will be content with a mean Eſtate, that will neglect Wealth
and Abundance, and deſire God not to heap too much upon them, but to abate of
his Portion: There are but few that will with <hi>Daniel</hi> refuſe the
King's Delicacies, and feed upon Pulſe, and with the great St. <hi>Paul</hi>
take Pleaſure in Neceſſities: Many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed will tell us, They are
reſolved to quit the World both in Mind and Body, but Cuſtom is a Thing we
often fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by flying it, and we ſhall not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hear Men
ſwear they will not ſwear. I verily believe many of our Loyal Countrymen
have had ſo ſad Experience of this World, and do ſo little deſire to
learn that which they are ignorant of therein, that they would be very glad to
forget what they already know of it, and do really wiſh they were like ſome
of thoſe Hermits, that inquir'd how Cities were made, and what kind of 
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0544000400:158"/> Thing a King or a Commonwealth was?</p>
            <p>There is no Voice ſounds better in a ſober Man's Ears, than that
which cry'd to <hi>Arſenius, Fuge, ſede, tace</hi>; which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels Men
to give themſelves Satisfaction by their quiet retiring: <hi>Crede mihi qu
bene latuit, bene vixit,</hi> ſaid a wiſe Man: But yet whereſoever we
are, or in what Condition ſoever, (if we can but tell our ſelves what and
where we would be) we may make any Place or State happy to us: For we are ſo
compoſed, that if Abundance or Glory ſcorch or melt us, we have an earthly
Cave (our Bodies) to go into by Conſideration, and cool our ſelves; and if
we be frozen and contracted with lower and dark For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, we have within us a
Torch, a Soul brighter and warmer than any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, we are therefore our own
Umbrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's, and our own Suns.</p>
            <p>But as all Shadows are of one Colour, if we reſpect the Body from
which they are caſt; ſo all Retirings into a ſhadowy Life, are alike from
all Cauſes; only the Employments, and that up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n which we beſtow our Time, gives it the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and the Beauty.
Thus our Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows upon Clay will be dirty, and in a Garden green and flowry;
ſo in our <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0544000400:159"/> Retirements, if we only converſe with
Earth, we ſhall be like it, that is, unlike our ſelves: But if we be
ingaged in more refined and intellectual Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we ſhall be
ſomething more than our ſelves, that is, than this narrow Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of
Earth ſpeaks us, the Soul being always like the Object of its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and
Converſe; and therefore well ſays the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator,
<hi>Erigimur</hi> &amp; <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiores fieri videmur, humana deſpicimus
contemplantéſque ſupera &amp; caeleſtia, haec noſtra ut
exigua</hi> &amp; <hi>minima contemnun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, it is not enough to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated from the
Converſe of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for tho' we have freed our ſelves from the Court and
from the Market, yet we are not thereby free from the principal Torments of our
Life; tho' we change Places never ſo often, yet may our Vices follow us even
into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured Cloyſters: The hollow Rocks, the wearing Hair-Shirts, and
continual Faſting, rid us not always from them, for a Holy Habit cleanſes
not a foul Soul. And as <hi>Socrates</hi> being ask'd, <hi>Why one who had been
long abroad, had not more improv'd himſelf by Travel,</hi> anſwer'd well,
<hi>Becauſe he had not left himſelf behind him when he went to Travel:</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0544000400:160"/> So before a Man leaves the World, if he do not firſt
diſcharge both himſelf and his Mind from the Burthen that preſſes her,
Retiring will but ſtir it the more, and preſs it the harder, as a ſick
Man takes more Hurt than good by changing Place: It is but ſettling an Evil
inſtead of removing it, and if we caſt back a kind Look upon what we have
left behind, we ſtill carry our Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters along with us, and are not at
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. We ought therefore firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our ſelves from our
ſelves, for without managing our Superior Part, all the Pains taken about the
Inferior is to no purpoſe: And he that only chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges his Cloth of Gold for a
Monk's Habit, and his <hi>Point de Venice</hi> for a Demy Collar, ſhall
without doubt be a Loſer by the Bargain: It is indeed no ſuch eaſie
Matter, as many Men believe, to make a ſafe Retreat from the World, to
truſs up our Baggage, and bid our Company farewel; this is a Burthen which
few Men can take up handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: For a Man to anticipate the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of
Fortune, to deprive himſelf of his preſent Advantages, is an Action of
extream Difficulty, as well as of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Virtue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0544000400:161"/>But tho' the doing theſe Things ſeem very
ſevere to our worldly Imaginations, and to thoſe who never had Experience
in themſelves of this nobleſt Operation of the Soul; yet doth this retiring
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo great Effects, and carries with it ſuch ſpiritual Charms and
Delights, that ſhould good Fortune her ſelf come in Perſon to find them
out, who are thus withdrawn, to invite them again into the World, yet would
they ſhut their Doors againſt her; and tho' ſhe ſhould tell her Name,
ſhe ſhould not be admitted. The Religious retir'd Man is an inverted
Pyramid, Earth hath but the leaſt Point of it; A Soul that dwells in Heaven
will not dabble in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Mud, or ſtoop to be a Copartner in the
Delights of the Creatures, that have nothing but Beaſt in them; and tho' it
be neceſſitated by its relation to Fleſh to a terreſtial Converſe,
yet it is like the Sun without contaminating its Beams.</p>
            <p>Thus Religious Perſons, when they come abroad into the World,
partake not of any worldly Humour, they can ſafely look upon the Throng, and
(more truly than <hi>Socrates</hi> at the <hi>Olympian</hi> Games) give God
thanks, that he hath made them not to need thoſe many <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0544000400:162"/>
Things which others ſo vainly and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently purſue: Their rais'd
Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions inlarge and ennoble their Spirits, and infinitely advance them
above the ordinary Level; Such Souls as theſe (that were only lent the Earth,
to ſhew the World their Folly in admiring it) poſſeſs Delights, which
in a manner an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidate Immortality, and (tho' at an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtance)
reſemble the Joys above, they receiving here ſome Anticipations of immortal
Delights, as Pledges of their eternal Rewards; for there want not Examples of
ſome, who have had their Souls elevated to ſuch a height of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Contemplation, that God hath made them as it were, in ſome meaſure,
Patterns of the Happineſs of the Life to come, which he hath ſometimes
vouchſafed to ſhew us here below, to make us in Love with the Piece above
in Heaven.</p>
            <p>This Divine Contemplation is, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus &amp; condus coeli &amp;
ſitula gratiae</hi>; it opens to us all the Treaſures of Heaven; This
remedies all our Sorrows, ſettles and compoſes all our Diſtractions, and
raviſhes our Spirits with unſpeakable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; to which purpoſe St.
<hi>Francis de Sales</hi> ſays moſt Divinely; <hi>We ſee the
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints which Religious Perſons put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0544000400:163"/>
               <hi>themſelves, we diſcern their outward Bitterneſs, but we are
not able to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend their inward Sweetneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; the very Fire and
Flames were to the Martyrs, Flowers and Perfumes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How injurious a Scandal is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which we are apt to caſt
upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Perſons, repreſenting them with angry and ſtoical
Countenances, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming them with melancholy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociable Humours,
believing Retirement to be a State, wherein the Soul contracts a Ruſt, which
cankers its own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and makes it unpleaſant to others; Whereas our
Saviour aſſures us, there is no Life ſo pleaſant and happy; and tho' he
himſelf is ſaid never to have Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet his Countenance is ſaid ever
to have been Smiling, and in full Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moroſe Humours, it was
prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of him, <hi>Quod non eſſet triſtis</hi> in his
Converſation.</p>
            <p>It is indeed an ill way of judging, That Men cannot have Piety in
their Hearts without Auſterity in their Looks, (a Virtue ſtuck with
Briſtles is too rough, when adorn'd with Flowers it will be willingly
entertain'd) a cloudy diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Face is not the only, or beſt ſign of
Devotion, very merry Men have been very holy and devout Men: No 
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0544000400:164"/> Man loves to ſee ſuch Religious, whoſe Thorns he
is afraid will ſcratch him; for Chriſtian Philoſophy hath nothing in
common with the Cynick; this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſeth, the other reforms; the one
compoſes the Countenance, the other regulates the Spirit; the truly Religious
are Auſtere to none but themſelves, their Thorns prick no Body elſe; it
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Vulgar Error to believe, that thoſe which retire with the greateſt
Strictneſs ſhould not have their Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; all the Hours of their
Lives are not equally Serious, neither are all their Sayings, Sermons; it being
a Right moſt proper to them of all others, to have this <hi>Olium

being the only Fruit of a good Conſcience; and ſince that is to them a
continual Feaſt, there is no Reaſon but they ſhould be Merry at it: This
is the Subſtance of all their Actions, and their conſtant Triumph, having
this they want nothing, <hi>Quamvis ipſis nihil eſt, nihil deeſt</hi>:
All their Treaſure lies in the Temple of <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0544000400:165"/> Wiſdom,
which they do ſo well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, that they become living Books to them that

can poſſibly be capable of.</p>

muſt do ſo too, and vent ſome of my Thoughts; tho' perhaps, as all other
Buds are yet without Taſte or Virtue, theſe Lines may be alſo dull and
inſipid; and tho' the Pleaſantneſs of the Seaſon invites me, it does
not much pleaſe me, ſince I ſee every Thing refreſhes, but I wither and
grow Older, but not Better, my Strength diminiſhes, and my Load grows
heavier.</p>
            <p>There are certain Rules for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Infirmities, which if
rightly obſerv'd will effect their Cure; but for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of the
Mind, there is no Rule, for our own Taſte and Apprehenſion, which ſhould
be the Judge, is the Diſeaſe it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0544000400:167"/>I am now no more tranſported with Jollity,
and the love of Company, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at preſent Loads heavy at my Heels, which
bring to my Thoughts my ill Fortune, my old Age, the Duties of a Man, of a
Subject, of a Husband, of a Father, with all the Incumbrances of a numerous
Family; theſe Thoughts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject me into Sadneſs and Melancholy, and from
thence into a ſerious Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Troubles and Miſeries of this
Mortal Life; which have farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me, in this Time of Solemn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
to entertain my Thoughts upon ſome Divine Subject, the better to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
my Mind and ſubmit my Will to the Orders of Divine Providence.</p>
            <p>I know well, as no Beauty, ſo no Diſcourſe hath all Voices,
even in the worſt Faces ſome Eyes ſee Features that pleaſe, in the
beſt ſome others ſee Lines they like not; ſome out of Affection may
Plat a Lawrel for that Head, on which others in their Opinion would beſtow a
Thiſtle, which may perhaps be my Fate: However, I am not ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to hang
the Ivy-Garland at my Door, leaſt I ſhould ſeem like thoſe Hoſts that
uſe to meet their Gueſts upon the Way, and promiſe before-hand a fair and
ample Entertainment; Let it pleaſe my Reader <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0544000400:168"/> rather to
ſee and allow his Cheer, and then according to his own Palate he may
diſguſt or reliſh the Cookery.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but many an accurate Quill on the Wing of Contemplation
hath already taken a high Flight upon this Subject; my only Plea ſhall be, He
that cannot Soar like the Eagle, may be allowed to Flutter like the
Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
            <p>The Scripture is every where full of Variety, like a Garment of
ſeveral Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and upon the ſame Loom of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ, divers Workmen may
accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſeveral Fancies draw out ſome curious Threds of
Obſervation; and that Brain is very unhappy that meets not with ſome
traverſe of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more than it hath borrow'd from another's Pen; yet
I will not contemn the Judgment of the Wiſe, nor refuſe to learn from any
Inſtructor. I never read but of one fooliſh Cock that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Pearl
tho' found on a Dunghill:

            </p>
            <p>The laborious Bee is the Emblem of a working Brain, which Creature
is ſet <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0544000400:169"/> before us for a Copy of Induſtry; it is not
always droning upon one Flower, but throws her light aiery Body upon a
ſecond, ſo to a third, till her Thighs are loaded with a large Collection.
It is no leſs indeed than a wonder, that of almoſt the Shadow rather than
the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſo very ſmall a living Creature, Nature hath made ſo
incomparable a Thing. I had rather imitate this labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Inſect, than
challenge to my ſelf <hi>Arachne</hi>'s Motto, <hi>Mihi ſoli debeo.</hi> I
had rather bind up in this Poſie, ſome choice Flowers, which I have here

boaſt my ſelf with that little <hi>Arabian,</hi> that I have eriſcerated
my ſelf, and ſpun a Web out of my own Bowels.</p>
            <p>Having therefore impoſed this Task upon my ſelf, and finding
nothing more particularly deſcribed in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than ſeveral
remarkable Paſſages of the happy St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> I have
thereupon thought fit to make her the principal Subject of this Diſcourſe,
add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Reflections upon the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Good Thief, and upon
what happen'd to St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in the Phariſee's Houſe, what

            <p>Who this Woman was is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, and is ſooner
queſtion'd than anſwer'd: I know ſuch Problematical Diſquiſitions,
which have more Subtilty than Uſefulneſs, (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> on this
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Quaere</hi> ſays) are ſuperfluous; and of them we may ſay, as
the Philoſopher did of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Shops, <hi>How many Things are
here which we need not:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall omit theſe
Diſquiſitions, and will not be curious where the Scripture is ſilent:
Whoſoever ſhe was, ſhe ſtill carries the Name of what for ſome time
ſhe was, <hi>A Woman that was a Sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We commonly ſee ſome artificial Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, which according to
divers Sights and Aſpects, repreſent divers Things; ſuch an admirable
Peice, with a double Reſemblance, hath St. <hi>Luke</hi> (an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Painter) here delineated in the moſt lively Colours. Look on one ſide, You
ſhall ſee a laſcivious Woman offering her ſelf to Sale in the moſt
tempting Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſtep on the other ſide, You may behold an admirable
Convert, attended with a Retinue of Graces: View it which way you will, here is
the word, <hi>Ecce,</hi> Behold, like a Curtain before ſome exact Piece of
Workmanſhip, which likewiſe <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0544000400:171"/> hath a double Reference
to the Power of Chriſt who drew this Sinner, and to his Mercy who receiv'd
her.</p>
            <p>In this noble Hiſtory are ſeveral weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Circumſtances like
ſo many Wedges of Gold in a rich Mineral, and one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got appears at the Head
of the Mine, <hi>Behold a Woman,</hi> which is a Word of Emphaſis and Energy,
and if this Star ſtand over the Houſe, a <hi>Jeſus</hi> is within: Here,
like <hi>Janus,</hi> it looks backward and forward; and ſo I ſhall
diſcourſe of this Woman both as a Sinner, and as a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. And if it
ſhall ſeem diſtaſtful, that I inſiſt a little longer than perhaps
the Reader may judge neceſſary on the particular Sin, for which this Woman
was publickly noted, let me put him in Mind of the Anſwer which the Comic
Poet gave, who being accus'd of having brought a Lewd debauch'd Ruffian up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage, and ſo ſetting a bad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to young Men: <hi>'Tis true,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>I brought ſuch a Man on, but I hang'd him before he went off,
and ſo I gave them a good Example.</hi> Here is a better Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be
learn'd: All Women may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Woman as a Pattern to imitate, and even the
beſt may learn ſomewhat from her Story. For how ſinful ſoever ſhe may
appear at firſt, let us ſuſpend <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0544000400:172"/> our Cenſure till
the laſt Act, then we ſhall find how ſhe became <hi>à

lebéte, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ala,</hi> of a Caldron boiling with Luſt, a Chryſtall
Vial of pure Chaſtity; how ſhe that at firſt was running apace into the
<hi>Dead Sea,</hi> did ſpeedily turn into the Path to
<hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with her Fall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider her firſt as a
Sinner.</p>
            <p>But alas! who is not ſo? Had ſhe not been a Sinner ſhe had
been a Miracle; he that knows himſelf to be a Man, knows himſelf to be a
Sinner, for in the Loyns of our firſt Parents we all ſinned; ſo that it
is abſurd to ſuppoſe a Separation of Sin from Man's Nature: In our
Conceptions thro' that Original Pollution, we are all warm'd in unclean Blood,
and ſtill we continue <hi>ponere Adam ſuper Adam,</hi> to add new Sin to
our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin: This Hereditary Poiſon is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in every Man, and the
Sullage of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Clay ſticks faſt to us: By <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſinning all his Seed are become ſinful, and all his Off-ſpring, as in a
continued Line, do like corrupted Branches of a rotten Tree, ſtill bring
forth corrupted Fruits.</p>
            <p>The moſt perfect and glorious Light in the World is the Sun in the
Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet hath he his Paralax, and his <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0544000400:173"/> Variation:
And what Son of <hi>Adam</hi> was ever found, thro' the Zodiack of whoſe Life
an Ecliptick could not be drawn? A Man without Sin is like the Mountain of
Gold, or the Philoſopher's Stone, which have no Exiſtance but in Theory and
the Operation of the Underſtanding. In Scholaſtical Speculations you will
hear the Noiſe of ſuch a Being, but you ſhall no ſooner find him than
the Eccho in the Poet, <hi>Quem non invenis uſquam, eſſe putas
nuſquam:</hi> Such Utopical Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is only an idle Dream of the
Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts. It is the Voice of an Apoſtle, <hi>In many Things we offend
all.</hi> Nothing more certain, than that Corruption has deep Root in God's
peculiar People: Even their beſt Works (and they too like <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
Sculpture, <hi>a little upon a Pillar rare and few</hi>) will but weigh light
in the Scales of the Sanctuary. As the Curtezan <hi>Lais</hi> ſaid,
<hi>Philoſophers did ſometimes knock at her Gates, as well as other
Men</hi>; ſo the beſt Men are often overtaken by human Frailties; let the
beſt do what they can, they are but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly Good, in ſome Matter or
other they ſtep aſide from God's Commands. It is a Truth as clear as the
Sun, that the Seeds of Sin are in all Men, the Seeds not the Practice; there is
not in <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0544000400:174"/> all the ſame Eruption, but there is in all the
ſame Corruption. Some are Kytes, others Hawks, and the reſt Eagles, and yet
all from the ſame Eyrie; he that bears Humanity about him, he that's cloathed
with Fleſh and Blood, cannot but Sin: And yet tho' we cannot avoid being
Tempted, yet we may ſhun the Commiſſion of Sin. It is one Thing to dart
and glance a wanton Deſire, and another to court and plead for it. Tho' the
Motions of Fleſh be alike in all Men, yet the humouring thoſe Motions is
not ſo. It is one Thing for a Man to Sin, another to give himſelf over to
the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin. This continuance in any notorious Sin, is not only
a Grave to the Soul, but a great Stone rolled to the Mouth thereof to keep it
down.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſays of <hi>Paris, That after a Man hath
uſed himſelf to the odious Scent of it, it grows more and more agreeable to
him,</hi> is too true of Sin, which by long Entertainment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Cuſtomary,
and not eaſie to be diſmiſs'd.</p>
            <p>We know that an expert Swimmer, being under Water, feels not the
weight of a full freighted Ship of a thouſand Tuns riding perpendicularly
over his Head; ſo whilſt we ſwim in the Cuſtom <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0544000400:175"/>
of any pleaſing Sin, we are inſenſible of the Burthen of it; for
frequency of Sin doth fleſh us in Immodeſty, aſſiduity in Impudence,
and that Sin is almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable that is ſteel'd by Cuſtom; which is a
true Character given of this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who is not deſcribed as a Woman who had
ſinned, but <hi>a Woman that was a Sinner</hi>; it was not a tranſient, but
a permanent Condition, that gave her that Denomination, her long continuance in
her Trade had branded her with this Title, <hi>A Woman that was a
Sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Woman was of a Noble Deſcent, and (as is generally receiv'd)
was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for a luxurious and inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Life; and in thoſe looſe
Days, wherein <hi>Herod</hi> erected his Theaters and Amphitheaters, Debauchery
was very much encouraged. And however Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons may flatter themſelves, and
take that for true Doctrine, which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Tutor ſometime ſpoke in
the Comedy, <hi>Non eſt crede mihi, adoleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centi; It is no ſuch Fault in
a young Man to follow Harlots</hi>; yet it is ſuch a Sin, as commonly drives
to the Devil at once, a Sin which once indulged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes what may be call'd a
pleaſant Madneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0544000400:176"/>Hiſtory tells us of a certain Well in
<hi>Epirus</hi> that will quench Firebrands if put into it, and yet when they
are quenched it will preſently ſet them on Fire again: Like this Water is a
laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Woman, when ſhe quencheth the Luſt of the Body for a time,
ſhe ſetteth it on Fire afterwards much more witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Therefore
<hi>Fonſeca</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath Emblem'd this Vice by the
Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix, which does revive and renew her ſelf by the Fire which ſhe
kindles by the Motion of her Wings. Thus we mourn perhaps, and bewail, and
repent, of the Sin we have committed, and deſire to give it over, that it may
Die with us, but with the Wings of our Thoughts we blow thoſe Coals afreſh,
and make them Flame more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Thus we walk the Round, firſt we act a Sin becauſe the Thought
pleaſes us, then we think that Sin over again, becauſe the Act hath pleas'd
us; and amongſt the great variety of Sins, there is none more plauſible,
nor more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to Nature than Wantonneſs: How many ſet their Souls
burning in the Flames thereof, and (as <hi>Nero</hi> did when he had ſet
<hi>Rome</hi> on Fire) behold them with Tranſport and Delight? How 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0544000400:177"/> many ſilly Wretches, like the fooliſh Lark, whilſt
it playeth with the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſtoopeth to the Glaſs, are caught in the
Fowler's Net? For a laſcivious Woman (to give a ſhort but true Character of
her) is the Devil's Pitfall, a Trap to catch our Souls: Her Eyes, like free
Doctors, live upon the ſpoil of Stragglers; ſhe baits her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires with a
Million of proſtituted Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, her diſplay'd Breaſts, and looſe
Glances, Locks wantonly waving over her Shoulders, her artificial Complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(the Counterfeit of the Great Seal of Nature) her curl'd Hair, (the
Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the old cunning Serpent) her high Waſhes and Paintings are
ſo many Lures to bring the Adulterer to the Snare.</p>
            <p>But chaſte Thoughts will check and never ſtoop to ſuch
Enticements; For when Fire falleth on Fuel that is wet it preſently goeth
out.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Wife, one of the greateſt Ladies in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> did inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately affect, impudently ſollicit, and, in a
manner, force the Modeſty of her good Servant <hi>Joſeph,</hi> how much
rather did he leave his Garment than his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Nor did he reſcue himſelf
from Adultery and Danger by Violence to her <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0544000400:178"/> Perſon,
nor neglect the Duties he owed her as a Servant, but with the hazard of his
Name, Life and Liberty, he made an innocent Eſcape to preſerve his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Garment of Chaſtity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arabian</hi> Proverb is elegant, <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue quinque
feneſtras ut luceat domus, Shut the five Windows that the Houſe may be
lightſome</hi>; cleanſe the Limbeck of the Senſes, leaſt thence ſome
Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on drop into the Soul. If at once we would overcome the Temptation and
the Tempter, we muſt reſolve, with <hi>Alipius,</hi> to ſhut our Eyes
when we come amongſt Vanities; for the Eye is the firſt Part that is
ſtruck in ſuch Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, upon the firſt Aſſault it yields up our
ſtrongeſt Fort: The <hi>Eye</hi> beſides is the vaineſt of all the
Senſes, it takes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Delight to be cheated; one of the Pleaſures of
the Eye is the Decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and how eaſie is that Senſe deluded which
delights to be deceived.</p>
            <p>The antient Philoſophers before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> that held
Viſion to be perform'd by an Emiſſion of Beams, imagin'd the Eye to be of
a fiery Nature, wherein they were confirm'd by obſerving, if the Eye had a
Blow, Fire ſeems to ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle out of it: But certainly, how watry ſoever
better Experience hath found the <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0544000400:179"/> Subſtance of the Eye,
it is <hi>ſpiritually fiery,</hi> both actively and paſſively;
paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively for that it is inflamed by every wanton Beam, actively it ſets
the whole Heart on Fire with the inordinate Flames of Concupiſence: Thus
<hi>Sichem</hi> ſaw <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> and defiled her; <hi>Viderunt Oculi,
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puerant pectora flammoe,</hi> no ſooner did he ſee her than his Breaſt
was inflam'd with <hi>Luſt.</hi> Thus <hi>Amon</hi> fell ſick for
<hi>Tamar</hi>'s Sake, his Deſire of her began at the firſt Interview. Thus
when <hi>David</hi> walked upon the Roof of his Palace, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from
thence a beautiful Woman waſhing her ſelf; here was <hi>Mulier
longè, libido prope,</hi> for his petulant Eye recoil'd upon his Heart,
and ſmote him with vitious Deſires. Yet it is not the <hi>Eye</hi> it
ſelf, (for what is that but the Beauty of the Face, the bright Star of the
Orb it moves in) but the Viciouſneſs of the <hi>Eye</hi> that is to be
condemned; when we talk with our Eyes, then 'tis that we ſin with them. But I
dare not inlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject for fear of committing that which was a
noted Fault in <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the Rhetorition, (as <hi>Suetonius</hi>
tells us) that lighting on a Figure he would purſue it till he forgot the
Matter in hand; I will therefore return to diſcourſe more particularly of
this <hi>Woman,</hi> ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0544000400:180"/> in her Life, ſo
hateful for her Luſt, and ſo devoted to Incontinence, that ſhe was become
a common Scandal: For by her bad Example ſhe made the City ſo infamous,
that ſhe might more fitly be call'd, <hi>peccatum Hieroſolymae quam
peccatrix,</hi> the Sin of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> rather than a Sinner in
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Petrus Chryſologus</hi> obſerves, becauſe
the whole City ſhar'd the Diſgrace which ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
            <p>Sin is Sin wherever committed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before a Multitude, or in a
Deſart; yet the more publick the Fact is, the greater is the Scandal, and
this Woman's Offence was the more notorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was a <hi>City
Sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs that no Place can ſecure one from Temptations, which
come in too haſtily and uninvited, like rough Winds from every Corner of the
Sky, and in ſuch Number, as if each Minute were computed by them.</p>
            <p>We are apt to Fall, becauſe we are Mutable, but we do not commonly
Fall except ſome Occaſion be given; and how full is the World of ſuch
Occaſions? Our common Adverſary, the <hi>Devil</hi> (who has a thouſand
Ways of attacking us) finds how apt we are to ſtumble at ſomething or other
in our way: He <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0544000400:181"/> knows which way our corrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
bends, he ſifteth out what will work upon our Affections and
Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and with that he wooes our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Sin; like a skilful
Sailor he marks the Wind, and accordingly hoiſteth up or ſtriketh Sail; or,
like a cunning Poet, he gives every Actor a Part agreeable, and makes a
perpetual Uſe of the Bent of our Nature: Thus hath he a Wedge of Gold for
covetous <hi>Achan,</hi> a Crown for ambitious <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and a
<hi>Dinah</hi> for <hi>Sichem.</hi> And the Concurrence of Time and Place are
his principal Engines, which ſerve to give Aim to ſuch Faults as our Nature
is too apt to commit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Prompter; then ſurely in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt debauched
<hi>City</hi> are more Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Sin, than in private Cells. In a large
Concourſe of People you'll find many Brokers of Villany, who live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the
Spoil of the unthinking Part of Mankind. Where many Pots are boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there
muſt needs be much <hi>Scum</hi>; where Multitudes of Strangers meet, where
Variety of Delights entertain the Eye, it is more difficult to avoid
Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, for our Nature herein is like Fire, which, if there be any
Infection in the Room, draws it to its ſelf, or like Jeat, which, omitting
all more noble <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0544000400:182"/> and precious things, attracts only Straws
and Dirt.</p>
            <p>It was in a <hi>City</hi> where this Woman liv'd, where by her lewd
Example ſhe drew in others to offend, and her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was more prejudicial
becauſe ſhe was of a good Family: <hi>Satan</hi>'s Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons many times
ſend their Influence through ſome great Star into leſſer Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for

which infects the By-ſtanders and Lookers on.</p>
            <p>I do not find the Name of the City ſet down, yet many are bold to
affirm it was <hi>Naim,</hi> others will have it <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>;
where-ever ſhe liv'd ſhe was too well known in her Time, and having
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhew'd what her Offence was, I will not lay my Finger again upon
that Blot; and having thus far drawn the black Lines of her Life, I will now
look on the other Part, and conſider her as ſhe hath put off the
<hi>Sinner,</hi> and as ſhe is now become a <hi>Penitent.</hi>

               <hi>Scipio</hi> (as <hi>Livy</hi> ſays) never look'd ſo freſh,
nor appeared ſo lovely to the Eyes of his Soldiers, as after his Recovery
from a dangerous Sickneſs in the Camp; ſo <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0544000400:183"/> neither
does the <hi>Soul</hi> ever ſeem more beautiful than when ſhe is reſtor'd
to Health after ſome dangerous Conflict. The <hi>Palladium</hi> was very much
eſteem'd by both <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Graecians,</hi> not ſo much for
the Matter or Workmanſhip, as becauſe it was ſnatch'd out of the Flames
of <hi>Troy</hi>; ſo no Soul is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the Sight of <hi>God</hi>
and his <hi>Angels</hi> than that which is ſnatched out of the Fire of Hell,
and Jaws of Death.</p>
            <p>To ſee Men turning from God to the World, from Piety to
Prophaneſs, is as common as lamentable, every Day's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhews us
ſuch Sights. But to ſee Men return to God, is as happy as wondrous to
<hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi>; and what is more ſtrange, we ſee the
firſt Diſciples that came to <hi>Chriſt</hi> were ſuch as were moſt
deſperately enthrall'd to <hi>Satan.</hi> The <hi>Magi, Publicans,</hi>
Harlots, the Thief, the Blaſphemer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ſhews the Depth
of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s unſpeakable Mercy; who of the knottieſt and moſt
crooked Timber can make Rafters and Cielings for his own Houſe: Thus he can
call a <hi>Zachaeus</hi> from a <hi>Toll-booth</hi> to be a
<hi>Diſciple,</hi> and <hi>Mathew</hi> to be an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,</hi> and this
ſinful Woman to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert; who it ſeems came to <hi>Jeſus</hi> in
<hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Phariſee</hi>'s Houſe, who had invited Chriſt to
eat with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0544000400:184"/>She came not (as the ſtaring Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) to
glut her Eyes with the Sight of a Miracle and his glorious Perſon, nor (as
did the Centurion or the <hi>Syro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phenitian Woman,</hi> or the Ruler of the
Synagogue) for Cure of her Sickneſs, or in behalf of her Friend, or Child, or
Servant, but (the only Example of this ſort of coming) came for a Cure not of
any bodily Grief or Malady, but for her Sins. She came with Remorſe and
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret for them, to lay her Burthen at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>'s Feet, to preſent
him with a broken and penitent Heart, a weeping Eye and great Affliction; for
ſhe came humbling her ſelf, and fell down before him weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bitterly for
her Sins, pouring out a Flood of Tears large enough to waſh the Feet of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> which ſhe wip'd with the Hairs of her Head.</p>

            <p>But amongſt all the Demonſtrations of God's Mercy, we can never
enough magnifie his Goodneſs and Power in the Converſion of the dying
Thief, who was execrable amongſt Men, and a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer 
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0544000400:185"/> of God: My Soul is loſt in Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when I think of
him; the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender came to die, nothing was in his Thoughts but his Guilt and
Torment: <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſilent when he revil'd him, and being yet in
his Blood, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>this Soul ſhall live</hi>; his good
Spirit ſo breath'd upon him, and the Force of his Grace work'd ſo
inſtantly and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, that his laſt Hour was his firſt, wherein he
knew his <hi>Saviour</hi> to be God. <hi>In ipſo Crucis candelabro Sol

Croſs:</hi> The Light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was ſo powerful, that it awakned this
drowſie ſleeping Thief, leaving him ſo well inſtructed, that he
preſently burns with a zealous Impatience; he cannot hear the Revilings of
his Companion, but ſuddenly he becomes a Convert, chiding his
Fellow-ſufferer, ſaying, <hi>Doeſt not thou fear God, ſeeing thou art
in the ſame Condemnation.</hi> He confeſſes his Sins, <hi>We receive the
juſt Rewards of our Deeds, But this Man hath done nothing amiſs</hi>;
wherein he ſhews himſelf a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to preach; and laſtly he becomes a
<hi>Martyr</hi> praying, <hi>Lord remember me when thou comeſt into thy

               <hi>me when thou comſt into thy Kingdom.</hi> Is this
the Voice of a <hi>Thief</hi> or of a <hi>Diſciple? Dic ô Latro, ubi

and the whole Hoſt of Heaven? Seeſt thou any other <hi>Crown</hi> than that

beyond a <hi>Croſs</hi> at a <hi>Crown,</hi> beyond <hi>Diſſolution</hi>
at a Remembrance of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi>; as no Diſciple could be
more faithful, ſo no Saint could be more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; <hi>Nam juxta fluenta

What could the <hi>Martyr</hi> St. <hi>Stephen</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy more, or that
beloved Diſciple that lean'd on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Boſom? Or what could
the long Services of thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd the Heat of the Day obtain more at

            <p>Some Labourers were working hard in the Vineyard from the
<hi>firſt</hi> Hour, others from the <hi>third,</hi> others began at the

<hi>Noah,</hi> after him <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the reſt of the Holy
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>; but this <hi>Thief</hi> came at the Sun-ſetting, and he
that in the Morning was on his way towards <hi>Hell,</hi> is in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his Lord in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> For no ſooner had he cried, <hi>Lord
remember,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> anſwers him immediately, <hi>I ſay
unto thee,</hi> and promiſes <hi>thou ſhalt,</hi> and ſeals that
Promiſe with a Verily, and promiſes more than is asked, and that ſoon,
<hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, thou ſhalt this Day be with me in
Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſoon as <hi>Chriſt</hi> afforded this <hi>Thief</hi> any
Call, he came; and yet this Thief's Converſion is become a Proverb, and
ſatisfies and ſerves a Sinner in all Caſes of a late and Death-bed
Repentance; <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0544000400:188"/> But they that urge him as a Precedent, ought
to conſider that this <hi>Thief</hi> was not converted at <hi>laſt,</hi>
but at <hi>firſt</hi>; and when we can find out ſuch another Day, we may
expect ſuch another Mercy, a Day that open'd the Graves of the Dead, a Day
that divided the Veil of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it ſelf, a Day which the <hi>Sun</hi>
durſt not ſee, a Day that ſaw the Soul of God (if I may ſo ſay,
ſeeing that <hi>God</hi> was <hi>Man</hi> too) depart from <hi>Man</hi>;
there ſhall be no more ſuch Days, and therefore we muſt not preſume
upon ſuch Mercy.</p>
            <p>To the Chief of the Apoſtles, St. <hi>Peter, Chriſt</hi> ſays,
<hi>Whither I go thou can'ſt not come</hi>; but to this <hi>Thief,</hi> he
ſays, <hi>This Day thou ſhalt be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> So ſoon did
<hi>Chriſt</hi> bring this Thief to that height of Faith, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in that
low Eſtate upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> he pray'd for a <hi>Spiritual
Kingdom</hi>; whereas the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves (whom
<hi>Chriſt</hi> had eſtated in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and had given them
Reverſions of judiciary Places, twelve Seats to judge the twelve Tribes) yet
in that Exaltation, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was aſcending, they talked to him
of a Temporal Kingdom. <hi>Sic fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit fides innocentem latronem facit
infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas Apoſtolos criminoſos. Chriſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſo much Faith
into this <hi>Thief</hi> 
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0544000400:189"/> as juſtify'd him, and leaves
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſo far to their Infirmities as endangers them.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Thief</hi> came to know thoſe Wounds that were in
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body were his own Wounds in the Body of his
<hi>Saviour,</hi> ſo he came to declare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Faith in profeſſing
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, perfect Hope in the <hi>memento mei,</hi> and
perfect Charity in rebuking his Companion: He was ſuch a <hi>Thief</hi> as
deſerved Praiſe and Wonder, who had a good Bargain of Death, and was the
better and longer lived for being Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for he was thereby made Partaker of
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Martyrdom and Kingdom: And this <hi>Thief</hi> hath done
nothing but what we may all do, if we will lay hold on that Grace as he did:
<hi>Aſſumemus vocem latronis, ſi nolumus eſſe latrones, ut ſedeamus
à Dextris, pendeamus à Dextris:</hi> Let us be content to
ſuffer, but ſuffer in the Right, ſuffering as a Malefactor is ſomewhat
too much on the Left Hand; and yet even that Suffering does bring many to the
Right Hand, being joyned with a true and hearty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which is as a City
of Refuge to fly unto, it is the happy Plank that has ſav'd many a
<hi>Soul</hi> from the <hi>Gulph</hi> of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, the Board which after
Shipwrack <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0544000400:190"/> will carry us ſafe unto Land; and it is not
ill compared to a <hi>Phaenix</hi>'s Neſt, wherein the <hi>Old Adam</hi> is
conſum'd to Aſhes, out of which ariſes a new Man of God; for Converſion
is a Sacred Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, wherein when we are Born, we are Buried; and when we are
quicken'd we are kill'd, and when we are mortified we are rais'd. Thus
<hi>Nineve</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and yet not overthrown, it was overthrown by
Sin, and built again by Repentance. He that is a skillful Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent does
cunningly play this After-game, and a Sinner after his Recovery for the moſt
part ſeeks <hi>God</hi> more fervently, and is more fearful of Relapſing,
than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Sinning; like wild Beaſts break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their Toils, they
are more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious for the future, and the <hi>Saints</hi> come out of the Bed
of their Sins, as <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> did out of his ſick Bed, more Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
more Holy, more Penitent; as the <hi>Eagle</hi> that is weary'd, comes out of
the Water, into which ſhe has dip'd her Wings, with a more towering Aſcent
towards <hi>Heaven</hi> than ever. <hi>Dum pete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Regem,</hi> ſays
<hi>Martial,</hi> when <hi>Mutius Scaevola</hi> miſſed his Aim, and
inſtead of killing <hi>Porſenna,</hi> ſlew one of his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries by
miſtake, he preſently offer'd that Hand which gave the Blow as a 
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0544000400:191"/> willing Sacrifice to the Flame, which Hand grew famous
for being deceiv'd; and it had been leſs Reputation to have ſtruck his
Enemy to the Heart, than to puniſh it ſo ſtoutly for miſſing its Aim;
upon which the Poet took Occaſion to ſay, 
<q> 
                  <l>Major deceptae fama eſt &amp; gloria dextrae,</l> 
                  <l>Si non erraſſet, fecerat illa minus.</l>
               </q> Without any
change, I may apply it to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s Converſion: 
<q>Si non peccaſſet fecerat illa minus.</q> She would not have
been ſo famous, had ſhe not ſinn'd; neither is this a Parodox; for what
an Enemy would upbraid by way of Reproach, is the greateſt Praiſe that can
be; their very Sins do honour ſome, as the <hi>Devils</hi> did <hi>Mary
Magdalen,</hi> who are mention'd for her Glory, ſince we do not hear of them
until they were caſt out; For Repentance is a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeas</hi> that
diſchargeth Sin, making <hi>God</hi> to be merciful, <hi>Angels</hi> to be
joyful, and <hi>Man</hi> to be acceptable: And as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
affirms, <hi>It is a greater Deliverance, a mightier Miracle, and a bigger
Grace, that a Sinner ſhould be Converted, than</hi> 
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0544000400:192"/>
               <hi>that being converted he ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be ſaved:</hi> Here we ſee
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> being now touch'd with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for her former Sins
and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, like the thirſty and panting Hart in the extremity of Heat,
does eagerly long for the cooling Springs Her Soul was deeply wounded with the
ſting of her Sins, it ſtuck ſo faſt that ſhe could not get it out,
therefore with the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Deer ſhe comes to the Soveraign <hi>Dittany</hi>
to expel it; the Pool of her Conſcience was troubled, and with the
deſcending Angel inſtantly ſhe ſteps in for a Cure; for <hi>ut cognovit
venit,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe knew where <hi>Jeſus</hi> was, ſhe makes
haſte to him; And the Zeal with which ſhe approacheth <hi>Chriſt</hi> is
very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was at Dinner in a Phariſee's Houſe,
where we may obſerve by the way, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> frequented Feaſts,
and we do not find he was ever invited to any Table and refus'd it; if a
Phariſee or a Publican invited him, he made no difficulty to go, the end of
his going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was not to Eat, but to gain Souls to God, and to fulfill the
Will of his Father, which was his <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink:</hi> And at
whoſe Table did <hi>Jeſus</hi> ever Eat, and left not the <hi>Hoſt</hi> a
Gainer? When <hi>Zachaeus</hi> entertain'd him, Salvation came 
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0544000400:193"/> that Day to his Houſe, with the Author of it; and now
when this Phariſee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd him, his Table was honour'd with the publick
Remiſſion of a Penitent Sinner. But how comes this Woman to thruſt her
ſelf into this Phariſee's Houſe? Certainly great was her Faith, ſince
no Diſadvantage could affright her from coming to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> not the
Frowns, nor the Cenſure of a rigid Hoſt, who darted from his Eyes Diſdain
and Scorn, ſeeing ſo notorious a <hi>Strumpet</hi> come to the Upper
Chamber where he entertain'd his Company, and that too in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
Preſence, who knew her wicked Life, and (no doubt) was offended at her
Action. A <hi>Phariſee</hi>'s Houſe might have ſeem'd indeed an unlikely
Place to find a <hi>Saviour</hi> in, and it was very improper to ſerve in
Tears at a Banquet: Certainly the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> mov'd on the Waters:
Doubtleſs this Woman had heard from our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Lips, in his
Heavenly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, many gracious Invitations of all diſtreſs'd and
ſin-burthen'd Souls, and now at length ſhe was entangl'd in the Net of his
Heavenly Doctrine: For our <hi>Saviour</hi> (as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>
ſays) hath two ſorts of Nets, a one of Wonders, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Words; in the
former of theſe he caught thoſe many that believ'd on <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0544000400:194"/> his Name; by the latter he inclos'd his very Enemies, even thoſe
very Officers that were ſent to apprehend him, and bring him before the
<hi>High Prieſt</hi>; and ſtill doth our Bleſſed Saviour ſpin out the
Thread of his Love, to an infinite Length, to try whether we will lay hold on
it. He doth angle for us, he ſits in <hi>Heaven,</hi> lets down the Line of
his Love, and Baits it with his <hi>Mercy,</hi> to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will
ſwallow it, that he may catch our Souls; with ſuch a Hook was this Woman
taken, ſhe had treaſur'd up his Sayings in her Memory, ſhe had
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that he not only pardon'd Sinners, but receiv'd them into his
Preſence, ſhe had obſerv'd the Paſſages of his Power and Mercy, and a
deep Remorſe wrought in her ſelf, for her miſpent Life; and ſurely, had
not the Spirit of God wrought upon her, ere ſhe came, ſhe had neither
ſought nor found <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For thoſe good Graces which
<hi>God</hi> finds in us, are like the Silver which <hi>Joſeph</hi> found in
<hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi>'s Sack, of his own putting in. If his Hand does not move the
golden <hi>Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> it will give no pleaſant Sound, for our Will herein
is like a lower Sphere, which receives its Motions from ſome firſt Mover.
And we may believe, the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> firſt breath'd, and then that 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0544000400:195"/> Blaſt begat the Shower of Tears which <hi>Mary</hi>
pour'd out; for firſt; Thus ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt mov'd by the <hi>Spirit of
God,</hi> comes in and finds <hi>Chriſt</hi> whom ſhe ſought; ſhe comes
into his Preſence not empty handed, but with a precious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of
<hi>Ointment</hi> of <hi>Nardus,</hi> the chief of all Ointments, which ſhe
intended to beſtow; this delicate odoriferous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume, ſhe brings in as
rich a Veſſel, a <hi>Box of Alablaſter</hi>; ſhe uſed likewiſe a
good <hi>Decorum,</hi> ſhe did not preſently pour out her Ointment upon the
Feet of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; but (obſerving a decent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in her Repentance,
and in this her laudable Action) firſt ſhe gives the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a broken
Heart, ſhe ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind at <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Feet, her Eyes
ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teſtified her godly Sorrow, which dropp'd down Tears as
faſt as the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Trees their medicinal Gums: She wept ſo
plentifully, that with thoſe Streams of Penitence ſhe began to waſh his
Feet, and did wipe them with the Hairs of her Head, to ſhew her Abje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or
Neglect of her ſelf: Thus cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly in Abaſement of her ſelf does this
humble Penitent, like the <hi>Syrophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitian</hi> Woman, like a Dog, lick her
Maſter's Feet; at the Feet of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhe makes a general
Sacrifice of all thoſe <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0544000400:196"/> Things wherewith ſhe had
offended him: <hi>Quot habuit in ſe oblectamenta, tot de ſe fecit
Holocauſta.</hi>
            </p>
            <q> 
               <l>Peccavit meretrix oculis, labriſque, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſque,</l> 
               <l>Inde luunt crimen lumina, labra, comae.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Her Eyes, her Lips, her Hair, her Ointment, all the Inſtruments of
her Sin, were turn'd at her Converſion into the Means of Life; as the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> that gave their Jewels to the making of a <hi>Calf,</hi>
did afterwards beſtow them upon the <hi>Lord's</hi> Tabernacle; ſuch was
this Woman's Practice, who having now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken leave of her former Vanities, and
diſrob'd her ſelf of all her rich Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, does, like an excellent
<hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,</hi> that knows how to mix his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, make a moſt
ſoveraign <hi>Antidote</hi> out of a moſt deadly <hi>Poiſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She uſed to ſend forth her alluring Beams into the Eyes of the
laſcivious <hi>Paramours,</hi> therefore from her Eyes flow a Deluge of
Tears, ſhallow enough to bear the Ark of her Sorrow; ſhe had made her Lips
the Incitements to Luſt, and Inlets to Vanity, but now they ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
themſelves with their Reſpect to the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; her
Hair, which ſhe had <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0544000400:197"/> ſo often curl'd at her Glaſs,
doth now ſerve for a Towel to dry his Feet; her odoriferous Perfume,
wherewith ſhe uſed to make her ſelf acceptable to her amorous Companions,
ſhe beſtows on thoſe ſacred Feet which her Eyes had watered, her Hair
dried, and her Mouth kiſſed. And this ſtrange Circumſtance of her
anointing was ſcarce done to any but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor to him but by
this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: It was eſteemed ſo great an Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of Love and Adoration,
that to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the Feet even of the greateſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi> was long
unknown in all the Pomps and Greatneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality. It
was not us'd (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays in his natural Hiſtory) till
<hi>Otho</hi> taught it <hi>Nero,</hi> in whoſe Inſtance it was by
<hi>Pliny</hi> reckon'd for a Prodigy of unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Profuſion, and in
it ſelf it was a Preſent for a <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>an Alablaſter
Box</hi> of Nard Piſtick was ſent as a great Preſent from
<hi>Cambyſes</hi> to the King of <hi>Aethiopia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But was the Oyntment ſo precious, and ſhe ſo poor that ſhe
could not bring a Napkin? certainly ſhe wanted not fine Linnen to have dry'd
Chriſt's Feet with; but to ſhew her hearty Devotion, and ſincere
Humility, her Shame, her Tears, her godly Sortow were not enough, ſhe 
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0544000400:198"/> ſtill ſeeks farther to make her ſelf more vile,
and of no Price before <hi>Chriſt</hi>; ſhe her ſelf is the Servant that
waits on him; from her ſelf do fall the Dews of Water that waſh his Feet;
and as her Eyes were the <hi>Ewer,</hi> ſo her Hairs were the <hi>Towel,</hi>
uſing the chiefeſt Ornament of her Head in the meaneſt Office of our
Saviour's Feet; and thus ſhe ſeems to climb up towards Heaven by the ſame
Rounds of that Ladder by which ſhe was formerly going down to Hell.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Phariſee</hi> obſerved this Woman
ſo buſy in the Expreſſion of her <hi>Religion</hi> and Veneration of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> he thought within himſelf, this was no <hi>Prophet</hi>
that did not know her to be a <hi>Sinner,</hi> and that would ſuffer her to
touch him. For altho' the <hi>Jews</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion did permit the Harlots of
their own Nation to live and enjoy all the Privileges of their Nation, except
only that their Oblations were refus'd: Yet the Phariſees (who pretended to a
greater Degree of Sanctity than others) would not permit them to civil
Uſages, or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of ordinary Society, and thought Religion it ſelf and
the Honour of a Prophet was concern'd in the ſame Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſneſs.
And therefore <hi>Simon</hi> made an Objection within himſelf, which 
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0544000400:199"/> 
               <hi>Jeſus</hi> knowing (who underſtood his Thoughts
as well as his Words) made an Apology for her and himſelf by a civil
Queſtion, expreſs'd by way of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of two Debtors, to whom a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and a ſmaller Debt reſpectively was forgiven, both of them concluding, that
they would love their merciful Creditor in Proportion to his Mercy; which was
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s Caſe, who becauſe ſhe had much forgiven, loved
much, and expreſs'd it in Characters ſo large, that the <hi>Phariſee</hi>
might read his own Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and unhoſpitable Entertainment of the
<hi>Maſter,</hi> when it ſtood confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Magnificency of
<hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi>'s Charity and Penance, the laſt of which ſhe
ſufficiently expreſs'd by her Tears.</p>
            <p>Such is <hi>God</hi>'s Goodneſs, that he hath placed in the Eye
both the Diſeaſe and the Cure, the Faculty of Seeing, and the Sluce of
Tears, that they who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend by Seeing, may be recover'd by Weeping.
<hi>Tears</hi> are the Favourites, that have the Ear of the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; they are our Bills of <hi>Exchange</hi> which he allows, and
returns them with what Sums of Bleſſings we deſire; ſo long as we pay
him this Type of our Devotion, ſo long is our Tenure ſafe, 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0544000400:200"/> and our Title to his Goodneſs and Mercy
unqueſtionable.</p>
            <p>This Soveraign Water will recal a Sinner to the Life of Grace, tho'
never ſo far gone. Theſe heavenly Showers are the Streams of
<hi>Jordan</hi> which cure our <hi>Leproſie,</hi> the <hi>Silim</hi> to cure
our Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the <hi>Betheſda</hi> to heal our Lameneſs and Defects of
Obedience; never was the Poyſon of any Sin ſo cold, but the Hand of
Repentance could thaw it; never was the Flame of any Sin ſo hot, but the
Tears of Repentance could cool it: <hi>Magis frugiferae Lacrymantes
vineae.</hi> The bleeding Heart, like the dropping Vine, is for the moſt Part
fruitful. I cannot here expreſs my Thoughts of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s Tears
in a better Strain than that of the Poet.

               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0544000400:201"/>Her Ointment indeed was precious, but her
Tears were more ſo, her Tears were her beſt Advocates to plead for Mercy at
the Throne of Grace: <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum lacrymae pondera vocis habent:</hi> For
ſometimes Tears have as much Force as Words. She ſpake not, for ſhe knew
ſhe was before one who knew the moſt retir'd Thoughts, and moſt private
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of her Soul; what need her Tongue ſpeak, when her <hi>Eyes,</hi>
her <hi>Hands,</hi> her <hi>Geſture,</hi> her <hi>Countenance,</hi> and her
whole <hi>Behaviour,</hi> ſpoke her Deſires.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other Things obſervable in the greater and more ſolemn
Feaſts of the <hi>Jews,</hi> there were ſome <hi>Ceremonies</hi> uſed by
them as Preparations to their Feaſts, which <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us were
<hi>Three. Firſt,</hi> Their <hi>Salutation,</hi> which was ſhewn either by
Words, or ſome humble Poſture of the Body, ſometimes by Proſtrating
their whole Body, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Kiſſing the Feet, as in this
Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and commonly by an ordinary Kiſs of the Cheek, as a Pledge of
their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to their Gueſt. The <hi>Second</hi> was the Waſhing of their
Feet before they ſat down to Eat. The <hi>Third</hi> Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was pouring
Oil upon the Head. In all which Obſervances, <hi>Simon</hi> (tho' of the
formal Sect of the <hi>Phariſees</hi>) <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0544000400:202"/> was defective.
Inſomuch that our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> taxes him of this neglected Office in his
Entertainment, <hi>Thou gaveſt me no Water for my Feet,</hi> &amp;c. And well
might the <hi>Phariſee</hi> read his own Fault in the Praiſe
<hi>Chriſt</hi> gave of this Woman, ſo well ſeen in the Cuſtoms of her
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in redoubling of her Kiſſes of an humble Thankfulneſs on
thoſe Sacred Feet.</p>
            <p>To Repent then is to Kiſs the Feet of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and it is
all one to be ſorry for our Sins, and to love <hi>him</hi>; this is confirm'd
by our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Words, who denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates this whole Action from
<hi>Love. Chriſt</hi> ſays not, ſhe <hi>wept</hi> much, ſhe
<hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd</hi> much, but ſhe <hi>lov'd</hi> much, and by all means
ſhe ſought to expreſs her great Love, which great Mercy rais'd. For
nothing ſhe had was too dear, with her moſt precious and fragrant Ointment
ſhe anointed our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Feet, that rich and coſtly Teſtimony
of her Love ſhe beſtow'd freely, for ſhe did not <hi>drop</hi> but
<hi>pour,</hi> not a <hi>Dram</hi> or <hi>two</hi> but a <hi>whole Pound,</hi>
not reſerving any, but breaking the Box, and pouring it all out: What went
before was the Sacrifice of a broken Heart, with that firſt Sacrifice ſhe
ador'd the Divinity of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> this laſt ſhe tendreth to his
Humanity: The <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0544000400:203"/> firſt Shower of her Tears were Tears of
<hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi>; the latter, which overtook the
firſt, were Tears of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> And ſo pleaſing to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> were all the Actions of this perfect Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, that he not
only defended her againſt the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> in preferring her
Kindneſs to the Entertainment of his Houſe; but againſt <hi>Satan</hi>
and the Powers of Hell, in forgiving her many Sins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Enumeration of
them. This is the Subſtance of what paſſed betwixt <hi>Jeſus</hi> and
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee's Houſe; but I cannot leave this
happy Convert there, but muſt follow her to <hi>Bethany,</hi> to ſee her
Comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, and at our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Death, and after that at his
Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeſus</hi> having left <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the 3d Year of
his Publick Miniſtry, after he had Wept over it, he came to <hi>Bethany,</hi>
where he met with another ſort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception than he had at the <hi>Holy
City</hi>; there he Supped; where <hi>Martha</hi> making great Preparations for
his Entertainment, to expreſs her Joy and Affection to his Perſon,
deſir'd <hi>Jeſus</hi> to diſmiſs her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Mary</hi> from his
Feet, who ſate there Feaſting her ſelf with the Food of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the
Words of God, unmindful of providing for his Entertainment; But 
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0544000400:204"/> 
               <hi>Jeſus</hi> commended her Choice, and tho' he did
not expreſly refuſe <hi>Martha</hi>'s Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, yet he preferr'd
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Religion. Here <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> (who had ſpent before
one Box of <hi>Nard Piſtick</hi> upon our <hi>Lord</hi>'s Feet as a Sacrifice
for her Converſion) now beſtow'd another in Thankfulneſs in reſtoring
her Brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> to Life, and conſign'd her <hi>Lord</hi> to his
Burial; and here too ſhe met with an evil Interpreter, <hi>Judas</hi> an
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi> one of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own Family, pretended it had
been better to have given it to the Poor; but it was <hi>Malice</hi> and the
Spirit of Envy that ſpoke, not Religion. For he that ſees an Action well
done, and ſeeks to undervalue it, by telling how it might have been done
better, reproves nothing but his own Spirit; For a Man may do very well, and
<hi>God</hi> will accept it, tho' to ſay he might have done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is to
ſay only, that Action was not the moſt abſolute and perfect in it's Kind;
but the End of that Man beſt ſhew'd his preſent Meaning; and at the
beſt it could be no other than a raſh Judgment of the Action and Intent of
<hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and by his declaiming againſt her he made tacite
Reflections upon his <hi>Lord</hi> for ſuffering it; and yet it is not
intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0544000400:205"/> in the Hiſtory of the Life of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> that <hi>Judas</hi> had any Malice againſt the Perſon of
<hi>Chriſt</hi>; for when afterwards he ſaw the Matter was to end in the
Death of the Lord, he repented; but a baſe unworthy Spirit of
Covetouſneſs poſſeſs'd him, and the Relicks of Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for
miſſing the Price of the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment burnt in his Bowels, with a ſecret
dark melancholy Fire, and broke out into an Action which all Ages of the World
could never Parallel: <hi>To what end was this waſte of Ointment,</hi> ſays
<hi>Judas, for it might have been ſold for more than Three hundred Pence, and
been given to the Poor</hi>; but <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let her alone,
why trouble you her, ſhe hath wrought a good work on me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this was well intended, it was well taken by <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and approv'd of by all preſent except <hi>Judas,</hi> who liking his own Gain
better than any Scent in the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> Shop, ſeeing that ſpent
on his Maſter's Head, which he wiſh'd in his own Purſe, grumbled at it;
and that with ſo colourable a Pretence, that it was a needleſs Expence, a
Waſte, and that it might have been beſtow'd much better for the Relief of
the <hi>Poor,</hi> as that <hi>Judas</hi> drew ſome of the
<hi>Diſciples</hi> to favour the Motion, and to diſlike 
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0544000400:206"/> 
               <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and her Action; ſo that both
they and he joyn'd in one Bill; but he of wretched Covetouſneſs of Mind,
and they of a ſimple plain Intent and Purpoſe, thinking all that was
well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken was well-meant; ſo that the Action was not brought only
againſt her that beſtow'd it, but againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> that admitted
it. Whereupon he pleads her Cauſe, not only excuſing her, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
it as a good Work And yet the Ointment was not ſo pleaſing to his Senſe
as her Gratitude was to his Spirit; for he then declar'd, that the Ointment
which fill'd the Houſe with the Scent, ſhould fill the whole World with the
Report of it; and as far as the Goſpel ſhould be preach'd, ſo far
ſhould the Remembrance of her Action reach, as well for her Commendation, as
for our Imitation.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee Things well done are oftentimes ill taken, and often
good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions want good Conſtructions. No Perſon had ſuch Experience
of this as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>: The Scripture records three ſeveral
Virtues of hers, and in each of them ſhe was murmur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d at. When in the Bitterneſs of her Soul, ſhe
ſhew'd her Repentance by Tears, <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee</hi> did
what he could to Diſgrace her: <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0544000400:207"/> When ſitting at
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Feet, <hi>Martha</hi> her Siſter complain'd of her to
<hi>Chriſt</hi>; and now here again the third Time, when in an honeſt
regard of her Duty, ſhe's ſhewing her Thankfulneſs for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort receiv'd,
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own Diſciple ſpeaks againſt her. So that if ſhe
waſhes <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Feet with Tears it contents not, if ſhe anoints
his Head with Balm its Matter of Diſpleaſure, and if ſhe Sits ſtill and
ſays nothing, 'tis all one, ſtill <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> is in Fault, her
Doings ever ſtand awry: This is the Fortune of all that follow her Steps;
even <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf could neither have his Feet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, but
<hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> nor his Head anointed, but
<hi>Judas</hi> his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ſpeaks againſt it.</p>
            <p>But we muſt not leave <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> here; for
notwithſtanding theſe great Diſcouragements and Rebukes, which ſhe
receiv'd from <hi>Judas</hi> and ſome of the Diſciples, ſhe neglected not
her Duty, nor left her <hi>Lord</hi> till his Death; for loving
<hi>Chriſt</hi> more than her Life, ſhe followed him in his Journey to his
Death, attending him when his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fled, being more willing to Die with
him, than to Live without him. She was laſt at his Croſs, and firſt at
his Grave, ſtaid longeſt there, and was <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0544000400:208"/> ſooneſt
here; ſhe could not reſt till ſhe was up to ſeek him, ſought him
before the Day lighted her; ſhe ſtood by the Grave, where faint Love uſes
not to <hi>ſtand</hi>; we bring our Friends to the Grave, and there leave
them, but come no more at it, nor ſtay longer by it; but <hi>Mary
Magdalen</hi> did, and ſhe only and none but ſhe, as we ſhall ſee by
the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>We find in the whole Tenour of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that God
obſerves a mixture of much ſpiritual Power and Glory, with much outward
Meanneſs: The Goſpel is call'd a rich Treaſure in an earthen Veſſel;
the Myſtery conveyed is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but the Means of Conveyance mean and
contemptible; The whole Myſtery of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is made up of Power and
Meekneſs; his Conception was by the Holy Ghoſt, of a pure Virgin, but the
out-ſide Mean, his Bleſſed Mother, an Earthen Veſſel, the Spouſe of
a poor <hi>Carpenter</hi>; his Birth publiſh'd by an Angel, but diſcover'd
firſt to poor Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds; his Lodging pointed out by a Star, and yet his
Cradle but a Manger, his Nurſery but a Stable: Being in the Wilderneſs he
was attended by Angels; but ſee the poor Out-ſide, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt wild
Beaſts; in his Agony he <pb n="700" facs="tcp:0544000400:209"/> was full of Trembling and
Horror, but then he receiv'd Comfort from Heaven by an Angel; at his Death he
was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Thieves, but yet the Powers of <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Earth</hi> trembled at it: The Tidings of his Reſurrection were told by
an Angel, but ſpread through the World by poor weak Women. Had Fleſh and
Blood had the Management of the News of his Reſurrection, it would have been
firſt publiſh'd to the College of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and St.
<hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have had the firſt Intelligence by a Viſion of
Angels directed to him. Kings and Princes make known their Minds to inferior
People by their <hi>Great Officers</hi> and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> but the
<hi>Court of Heaven</hi> takes other Meaſures. <hi>God</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys poor,
and in the Eye of the World, contemptible Men, to declare his Will to the
<hi>Potentates</hi> of the World: And this was the grand Objection made by the
miſtaken <hi>Pagans</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Diſciples, that
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was ſet on foot by ſuch abject and mean Perſons
as <hi>Chriſt</hi> made choice of; but that which begat in them Contempt and
Scorn, ought to fill us with Wonder and Admiration.</p>
            <p>And to make Amends for that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that no good Angel ever
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd the Likeneſs of a Woman, here <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0544000400:210"/> are Women
(of whom <hi>M. Magdalen</hi> was chief) made Angels, <hi>i. e.</hi> (as the
original ſignifies) <hi>Meſſengers</hi> and <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers</hi> of the
greateſt Myſtery of our Religion; for <hi>M. Magdalen,</hi> with other
devout Women, (who not conſidering the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt</hi>)
went with a pious Intention to do an Office of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Honour to the
Body of their Maſter, which they meant to embalm in the Tomb, where they
thought to have found it; there was <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of Life,
dead and laid in a Grave, and here was <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>dead Man</hi>
riſen out of the Grave; here are <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> employed
in ſo low an Office as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct Women, and Women employ'd in ſo high
an Office as to inſtruct the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>; here are <hi>angelical</hi>
Women, and <hi>evangelical Angels</hi>; Angels made <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi> to
preach the Goſpel, and <hi>Women</hi> made <hi>Angels</hi> to be
<hi>Inſtructors</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now tho' it has been doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>bleſſed
Virgin</hi> was there when this paſs'd at the Sepulcher, yet that <hi>Mary
Magdalen,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>James</hi> and
<hi>Salmone</hi> were there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>They came to embalm the Body of Jeſus, (for the Rights of
embalming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0544000400:211"/> the <hi>Jews</hi> us'd to laſt
<hi>forty Days</hi>) and their Love was not ſatisfy'd with what
<hi>Joſeph</hi> had done; but herein they were very inconſiderate, for that
was only done upon ſuch Bodies as were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenerated and embowell'd, and then
fill'd up and plaiſter'd about with Spices and Gumms to preſerve them from
Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, when they were to be carried into remote Parts; but of theſe
re-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmings, after the Body had been laid in the Sepulcher, I never read,
neither ſeems it to have been poſſible for theſe Women to have come at
the Body of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And by the Winding-ſheet of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
which is kept in <hi>Savoy,</hi> it appears that that Sheet ſtuck ſo
cloſe to the Body, as that it did, and does ſtill retain the Demenſions
of his Body, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and Marks of every Wound that he receiv'd
in his Body; ſo that it would have been no eaſie Matter for theſe Women
to have pull'd off that Sheet, if it had been faſten'd to his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with
nothing but his Blood: But if (as ſome Authors ſay) his Body was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
looſe in the Sheet which is ſhew'd in <hi>Savoy,</hi> from the Croſs to
the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and then taken out of that Sheet and embalmed by
<hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and wrapp'd up in other Linnen upon thoſe 
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0544000400:212"/> 
               <hi>Spices</hi> and <hi>Gums</hi> which he beſtow'd
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and then buried according to the Manner of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe
Cuſtom it was to ſwath the Bodies of the Dead, as we do Children, all over,
(for ſo <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> came out bound Hand and Foot with Grave-cloaths)
how could theſe Women think to embalm the Body of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſo
ſwath'd and bound up as that Body was? for certainly it was the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy not the
Grave-cloaths they meant to embalm, and it ſeems ſtrange that no one has
touch'd upon this Doubt: All Expoſitors make good Uſe of their Piety and
devout Care of their dead Maſter, but of the Impoſſibility of their
coming to the Body, of the Irregularity of their Undertaking that, and
proceeding ſo far in that which could not poſſibly be done, there is no
mention: Indeed <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſologus</hi> ſays, <hi>ſaeva paſſionis
procella tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baverat, that a bitter Storm of Paſſion and Conſternation
had ſo diſorder'd them, as that no Faculty of theirs could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their
right Function: &amp; praefervoſe caecutiebant,</hi> Earneſtneſs had ſo
diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd and amaz'd them, as they diſcern'd nothing clearly, nor did
nothing order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Another inconſiderate Action of theſe Women was, the
removing the Stone of the <hi>Sepulcher,</hi> for they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0544000400:213"/> their Gumms, and were on the way to the
<hi>Sepulcher</hi> before they thought of that; then they ſtop, and ſay one
to another, <hi>who ſhall roll away the Stone from the</hi> Sepulcher. Yet
they ſtill go on, and their Love anſwers the Objection, not knowing how it
ſhould be done; but yet reſolving to go through all Difficulties, but never
think how they ſhould paſs the Guard that was ſet at the Tomb. But when
they came there, they found the Guard affrighted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, and the Stone
roll'd away; for a little before they arriv'd there had been a great
<hi>Earthquake,</hi> and an <hi>Angel</hi> deſcending from <hi>Heaven</hi>
had roll'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Stone and ſate upon it; with the Terror of his
Appearance and the Earthquake, the Soldiers were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, and were like

Gumms againſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, who told you before he was not ſubject to
Corruption but would riſe again? <hi>M. Magdalen</hi> alſo fell into ſuch
another Error: For when the <hi>Angel</hi> had told her at the Sepulcher,
<hi>He is not here, for He is riſen, as he ſaid</hi>; yet when ſhe came
running to <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhe ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the
<hi>Reſurrection,</hi> never thought of that, but pour'd her ſelf out in
that Lamentation, <hi>they have taken away our Lord.</hi> Whereas if ſhe had
conſider'd, ſhe muſt neceſſarily have known from the Angel's Words,
that no Man had taken away the <hi>Lord,</hi> that no Man had laid him any
where elſe, but that by his own Power he was riſen: But as in this Storm of
Paſſion, they left <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Promiſe, that he would riſe,
unconſider'd, never remember'd the rolling of the Stone from the Door of the
Sepulcher, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they conſider the Impoſſibility of coming to
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body to do the Office they intended: Their Devotion was
awake, but their Conſideration was not ſo; however they did not loſe all
the Benefits of their pious and devout <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0544000400:216"/> Intention; for
the <hi>Angel</hi> did not forbear to comfort them with, <hi>Do not ye
fear:</hi> Let them continue in Fear that remain in Unbelief, and have no God
to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelves in. Let thoſe mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soldiers that are hir'd to
watch the Sepulcher fear, and never recover; but why ſhould <hi>You</hi> fear
who ſee none but us, your Fellow-Citizens in the Service of God, if your
Converſation be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as it is, if you do truly ſeek that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> who is riſen that he might go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>It ſeems the other Women, who came with <hi>M. Magdalen,</hi> and
ſtay'd till <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had been there to make Trial of
<hi>M. Magdalen</hi>'s Report, as they were ſpeedy in coming, and diligent in
ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo they were in haſte to be gone when they
could not find him, and fearful of farther ſeeking, and their Departure
commends <hi>M. Magdalen</hi>'s ſtaying behind: To the Grave ſhe came
before them, from the Grave ſhe went to tell them, thither ſhe returns with
them, and there ſhe ſtays behind them; a ſtronger Affection fix'd her,
and ſo fix'd her, that ſhe had not Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thence.</p>
            <p>To ſtay whilſt Company ſtays that is the <hi>World</hi>'s
Love, but <hi>Peter</hi> is gone, <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0544000400:217"/> and <hi>John</hi> is
gone, and the <hi>Women</hi> are gone, and ſhe left alone, and to ſtay
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſhews conſtant Love. She ſtood and wept, ſhe wiſh'd to find
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and therefore wept for his Abſence, whom ſhe dearly
lov'd whilſt ſhe had him, ſhe bitterly bewail'd him ſhe thought loſt;
and having loſt the Sight of her Life, ſhe deſir'd to dwell in the dark,
chuſing <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Tomb for her beſt home, and there ſtood
weeping; ſhe abandon'd the Living for the Company of the Dead; and now it
ſeems that even the dead have forſaken her, ſince the Body ſhe ſeeks
is taken away from her: It was Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd her to ſtand, and Sorrow forc'd
her to weep; her Eye was watchful to ſeek, whom her Heart moſt lov'd to
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; and her Feet in a Readineſs to run, if her Eye could chance to
eſpye him. But as ſhe watch'd to find her loſt Lord, ſhe wept for
having loſt whom ſhe had lov'd, for as firſt ſhe mourn'd for the
Departure of his Soul out of his Body, ſo now ſhe lamented the taking his
Body out of the Grave; for tho' her firſt Sorrow was becauſe ſhe could
not enjoy him <hi>alive,</hi> yet ſhe hop'd at leaſt to have found him
<hi>dead</hi>; to which purpoſe ſhe had prepar'd her <hi>Spices,</hi> and
provided her <hi>Oyntments,</hi> to <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0544000400:218"/> pay him the laſt
Duties: And tho' <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had already
beſtow'd a hundred Pound of Myrrhe and Aloes, which was as well apply'd as
Art and Devotion could deſire, yet ſuch was her Love, that ſhe would have
thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Quantity too little without the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of her own; ſhe came
therefore now intending to embalm his Corps, as ſhe had before anointed his
Feet; and as in the Spring of her Felicity ſhe had waſhed his Feet with her
Tears, bewailing unto him the Death of her own Soul, ſo now ſhe came in the
Depth of her Miſery to ſhed them again for the Death of his Body. But when
ſhe ſaw the Grave open'd, and the Body gone, the Labour of embalming was
prevented: But the Cauſe of her Tears increas'd, and tho' ſhe found no
Uſe for the Spices, yet ſhe found how to employ her Tears, now as much
afflicted for his Loſs, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had been pleas'd at his Preſence.
But ſince weeping without ſearching was to no Purpoſe, her weeping
hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd not her Inquiry, her Sorrow dull'd not her Diligence; ſhe often
ſtoop'd and look'd into the Grave, but why ſhould ſhe now look in,
ſince <hi>Peter</hi> had been in the Tomb, and <hi>John</hi> had look'd in
before. However ſhe will not truſt <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0544000400:219"/> either
<hi>Peter</hi>'s or <hi>John</hi>'s Eyes, nay ſhe will not truſt her
ſelf, ſhe will ſuſpect her own Senſes, ſhe will rather think ſhe
look'd not well before, than leave off looking. And thus hoping in Deſpair,
and deſpairing in Hope, ſhe ſtood at the <hi>Sepulcher</hi> without fear,
becauſe ſhe thought now nothing left that ought to be fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. But with what Hope or with what Heart
could ſhe ſtand alone at the Tomb, when the Diſciples were gone; for her
Eyes had ſeen, and <hi>Peter</hi>'s Hands had felt, that the <hi>Lord</hi>
was not there; the empty Winding-ſheet did alſo confirm it, and yet nothing
could make her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; her diſappointed Love had drown'd both her Mind
and Memory ſo deep in Sorrow, and ſo amaz'd her Senſes by his Abſence,
that all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his former Promiſes was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted with the Crowd of
preſent Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; for doubtleſs, had ſhe remember'd him, as ſhe
ſhould have done, ſhe would not have thought the Tomb a fit Place to ſeek
him in, neither would ſhe have mourn'd for him as dead, and remov'd by the
Treachery of others, but joy'd in him, as reviv'd by his own Power; but Sorrow
had quite ſtupify'd her Senſes, diſtemper'd her Thoughts, diſcourag'd
her Hopes, awak'd her Paſſions, and left <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0544000400:220"/> her no
other liberty than to weep, ſhe wept therefore; and as ſhe was weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhe ſtoop'd down, and look'd into the <hi>Sepulcher,</hi> and ſaw two
Angels in White, one at the Head, and the other at the Feet, where the Body of
<hi>Jeſus</hi> had been laid: Angels in a Grave! a ſtrange Sight! never
ſeen before: That ſure was a Place fitter for Worms than Angels. They were
in White too, a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour expreſſive of Joy, <hi>Heaven</hi> mourn'd at his
<hi>Paſſion,</hi> the Eclipſe of that Day ſhew'd them all in Black, but
at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> they rejoyce, they are now all in White, even
the Heavens and Angels. They were ſitting, the one at the Head, the other at
the Feet, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s having anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Head and his Feet, they ſat at theſe two Places, as it were to
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſo much for her Sake: Between the <hi>Angels</hi> there was no
ſtriving for Places; he that ſat at the <hi>Feet</hi> was as well
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, as he that ſat at the <hi>Head</hi>; but with us, both Angels
would have been at the Head, never a one at the Feet: <hi>And they ſaid unto
her, Woman, why weepeſt thou?</hi> They ask'd her, Why ſhe wept? believing
ſhe had no Cauſe, all was in Error, Tears of Grief, but falſe Grief,
imagining him to be dead that was <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0544000400:221"/> alive; ſhe wept
becauſe ſhe found the Grave empty, which, God forbid, ſhe ſhould have
found full, for then <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt have been dead ſtill; for want
of Belief in his Reſurrection, ſhe believ'd he was carried away; ſhe
err'd in ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; there was Error in her <hi>Love,</hi> but there was
Love in her Error; and it was a great Argument of her Love, to call him
<hi>Lord,</hi> after he had ſuffer'd the moſt opprobrious and ignominious
Death, ſuch as would have made many bluſh to own him.</p>
            <p>When ſhe look'd firſt ſhe ſaw no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and then of a
ſudden looking down, ſhe ſaw two; yet the ſuddenneſs and
gloriouſneſs of the Sight mov'd her not at all, ſhe ſeem'd to have no
Senſe of it, but wept on, which was ſtrange; for here methinks her good
Fortune exceeds her Hopes, and where her laſt Sorrow was bred, her firſt
Succour ariſes, for ſhe ſought but one, and ſhe found two; one dead
Body was the Cauſe of her Errand, and ſhe found two alive; her Weeping was
for a Man, and her Tears have found Angels, who invite her to a Parly, and
ſeem to pity her Caſe. They ſit at the Tomb, to ſhew they are no
Strangers to her Loſs, they ſpake to her, as tho' they had ſome ſpecial
Meſſage to <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0544000400:222"/> deliver to her; and if ſhe had ask'd
them concerning her Maſter, they were the likelieſt to give her a
ſatisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and to have told her the Cauſe of their coming, and
the Reaſon of her <hi>Lord</hi>'s remove; but nothing could move her to admit
Comfort, or to entertain any Company, for having vow'd her ſelf to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, except to him, ſhe will neither lend her Ear, nor
borrow others Help: Beſides, whatever they could tell her, if they told her
not of him, and whatſoever they told her of him, if they told her not where
he was, both their telling, and her hearing, were but a waſting of Time; for
ſhe came not thither to ſee Angels, but him who made both her and them, and
to whom ſhe ow'd more than to Men and Angels; and being full of wavering
Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and perplex'd Thoughts, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think, if ſhe ſtaid
there by the Tomb where he was not, ſhe ſhould never find him; and if ſhe
would go farther to ſeek, ſhe knew not whither; to part with the Tomb was
Death to her, and to ſtand helpleſs by it would do no good; ſo that all
her Comfort was, that ſhe muſt either ſtay there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Help, or go
without Hope: Then ſhe blam'd her ſelf, for leaving him when 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0544000400:223"/> ſhe had him, thus to lament him now ſhe had loſt
him, and for departing when it was time to ſtay, and returning when it was
too late to Help; forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what her Maſter uſed to ſay, when he told
her, <hi>He would riſe again the third Day:</hi> But why doth ſhe torment
her ſelf with theſe tragical Surmiſes? Does ſhe think the
<hi>Angels</hi> would ſit ſtill if their <hi>God</hi> were not well, did
they ſerve him after his Faſting, and would they deſpiſe him after his
Deceaſe? If in the Garden he might have had Twelve Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, (as he
ſaid) Is his Power ſo gone with the Life of his Body, that he could not now
Command them? Was there an Angel found to help <hi>Daniel</hi> to his Dinner,
to ſave <hi>Toby</hi> from the Fiſh, and to defend <hi>Balaam</hi>'s poor
Beaſt from his Maſter's Rage? And is the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
of ſo little Concern, that if his Body wanted it, no Angel would defend it?
But ſhe ſaw two there to Honour his <hi>Tomb</hi>; and how much more
careful would they be to do Homage to his Perſon? She might well think they
would not Smile, if ſhe had juſt Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Weep, they would not ſo
glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſit in white, if a black and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Weed did better become
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0544000400:224"/>But why did her Sorrow queſtion ſo much
about the Place where they had laid her <hi>Lord?</hi> might not ſhe better
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he was in <hi>Paradiſe</hi>; for ſince he came to repair
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Ruins, and to be the <hi>common Parent</hi> of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
as <hi>Adam</hi> was of our Original In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, 'twas reaſonable, that
having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd all his Life the Penalty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Exile, he ſhould
after Death re-enter upon a Poſſeſſion of that Inheritance which
<hi>Adam</hi> loſt. And beſides, if her Sorrow at the Croſs had not made
her as Deaf, as at the Tomb it made her Forgetful, ſhe could not but have
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd what he himſelf ſaid to one of the <hi>Thieves, That the ſame
Day he ſhould be with him in</hi> Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>Whilſt <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> thus loſt her ſelf in a
Labyrinth of Doubts, mixing Tears with her Words, and warming them with Sighs,
ſhe ſaw the Angels with a kind of Reverence as tho' they had done Honour to
one behind her; whereupon ſhe turn'd back and ſaw <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
ſtanding, but knew not that it was <hi>him.</hi> For when <hi>Jeſus</hi>
ſaw that nothing would give her Comfort but himſelf, that no
<hi>Angels,</hi> no Sight, no Speech of others would ſerve, then her
<hi>Lord</hi> comes, and from ſeeking him dead, ſhe <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0544000400:225"/>
finds him alive; but firſt he comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, ſtands by her, and ſhe did
not ſuſpect that it was he; ſhe not only knew not that 'twas
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> but miſtook him for the <hi>Gardiner:</hi> Proper enough it
was, and fitted well with the Time and Place, it was the Spring, and in a
Garden, and ſhe did not miſtake in taking him for a <hi>Gardiner,</hi> tho'
ſhe might ſeem to err in ſome Senſe; yet in another Senſe ſhe was
in the right: For in a Spiritual Senſe, <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be ſaid to be
a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, for of the firſt the faireſt Garden that ever was,
<hi>Paradiſe,</hi> he was the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, it was of his Planting, and ever
ſince it is he that makes all our <hi>Gardens</hi> Green, ſends us Yearly
the Spring, and all the <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> we gather in the
Seaſon: And 'tis he that gardens our Souls too, and weeds out of them
whatſoever is prejudicial to or deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of his Word ſown in our
Hearts. He ſows them with the true Roots of all <hi>Chriſtian Virtues,</hi>
waters them with the Dew of his Grace, and makes them bring forth Fruit to
<hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides all this, Chriſt on the Day of his Reſurrection was
moſt properly a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, and that a ſtrange One, who made ſuch an Herb
grow out of the Ground that Day, as the like was never ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, 
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0544000400:226"/> (except in the Inſtance of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> rais'd by
him) a dead Body to ſhoot forth alive from the Grave.</p>
            <p>But was it poſſible that <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> could forget
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> whoſe Faith had fix'd him in her Underſtanding, her Love
in her Will, both Fear and Hope in her Memory, for him her Eye weeps, her
Thoughts greive, her whole <hi>Body</hi> fainteth, her Soul languiſheth, and
there was no Part of her that was not buſie about him; and yet ſhe had
forgotten him; his Countenance and Voice aſſure her, his Words witneſs
it, her Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, and yet ſhe knew him not: But there was ſuch a
Shower of Tears between her and him, and her Eyes were ſo dimm'd with weeping
for him, that tho' ſhe ſaw the Man, ſhe could not diſcern
<hi>Jeſus</hi>; and therefore as he ſeems to her a Stranger, he asketh the
ſame Queſtion of her which the Angels had, only quickens it a little with
<hi>Woman why weepeſt thou, whom ſeekeſt thou?</hi> If ſhe ſeeks
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> why knows ſhe him not? and if ſhe knows him, why does
ſhe ſeek him whom ſhe ſees? It is a common thing with us to ſeek a
Thing, and when we have found it, not to know we have.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0544000400:227"/>Scarce three Days ago ſhe ſaw him hanging
on a Tree with his Head crown'd with Thorns, his Eyes full of Sorrow, his Ears
fill'd with Blaſphemies, his Mouth fed with Gall, his whole Perſon mangled
and disfigur'd, his Arms and Legs rack'd with violent Pulls, his Hands and Feet
boar'd with Nails, his Side wounded with a Spear, his whole Body torn with
Scourges and goar'd with Blood; and yet Chriſt asketh her, <hi>Why ſhe
weeps?</hi> and not without Cauſe doth he ask this Queſtion, becauſe
ſhe would have <hi>Chriſt</hi> alive, and yet wept becauſe ſhe did not
find him dead: She was ſorry he was not there, and for that very Cauſe
ſhe ſhould rather have been glad; for if he were Dead ſhe might have
expected to ſee him there, but his not being there was a ſign he was Alive:
But ſhe ſtill taking <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the Gardiner, ſaid unto him,
<hi>If thou haſt carried him from hence, tell me where thou haſt laid him,
and I will take him away:</hi> To ask <hi>Chriſt</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſeems ſomewhat ſtrange, which however it falls out in other Matters, here
it was ſafe, even when we ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to pray <hi>Chriſt</hi>
to help us to find <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for we cannot come to him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he
draws us: But <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ſeems ſomething more harſh to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> 
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0544000400:228"/> than to the Angels, to them ſhe
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of <hi>others,</hi> ſaying, <hi>they</hi> have taken him away: But
ſhe ſeems to charge <hi>Chriſt,</hi> at leaſt to ſuſpect him of the
Fact, as if he had look'd like one that had been a Robber of Graves; her
<hi>if</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies as much, but Love, as it fears where it need not, ſo it
ſuſpects without Cauſe. But St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> for her: <hi>Domine amor quem habebat in Te, &amp; dolor quem
habebat de Te, excuſat eam apud Te, ſi fortè erravit circa Te.</hi>
The Love ſhe bore him, the Sorrow ſhe had for him, may excuſe her, if
ſhe were in any Error concerning him, in her ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Si
ſuſtuliſti.</hi> Her Affections ſeem to tranſport her, (as ſhe
ſays) no Man knows what, to one a meer Stranger to her, and ſhe to him,
ſhe talks to one thrice under the Name of him, if thou haſt taken him, tell
me where thou haſt laid him, and I will fetch him; alas poor Woman, ſhe was
not able to lift him, there goes more than one or two either to the carrying of
a Corps; as for his, it had more than a Hundred Pound weight of Myrrh and other
Odours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p>She charged not the Angels with his Removal, nor ſeem'd to
miſtruſt them, for ſhe did not requeſt them to inform 
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0544000400:229"/> her where he was laid; but now ſhe judgeth the
Gardiner to be the Author of her Loſs, being almoſt fully perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that he was privy to the Place, and acquainted with the Action; and tho' ſhe
was not altogether in the right, yet ſhe was not much in the wrong, and err'd
with ſuch aim, that ſhe miſs'd very little of the Truth.</p>
            <p>But ſince ſhe was ſo deſirous to know where <hi>Jeſus</hi>
lay, Why did not ſhe name him when ſhe ask'd for him? She ſays only ſhe
will take <hi>Him</hi> away, her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſeems above the Strength of a
Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, neither does ſhe remember that all Women are weak, ſhe promiſeth
without Condition, ſhe makes no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as if nothing were impoſſible
that her Love ſuggeſteth. It was indeed wonderful, that <hi>Love</hi> had
ſo bereav'd her of Senſe, that tho' ſhe ſaw the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſhe could
not ſee <hi>Jeſus.</hi> She ſought for one, whom when ſhe had found
ſhe knew not; and not knowing him when ſhe found him, ſhe ſought for
him when ſhe had him: But alas, how could poor <hi>Mary</hi> believe, that
after her <hi>Lord</hi> had liv'd ſo long, labour'd ſo much, died with
ſuch Pain, and ſhed ſuch ſhowers of Blood, he ſhould come to no
higher a Preferment, than to be a <hi>Gardiner</hi>; <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0544000400:230"/> Was
a ſorry Garden the beſt Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance her Love could have imagin'd for him,
or a <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s Office the higheſt Dignity ſhe could allow him? It
had been better he had liv'd to have been <hi>Lord</hi> of her Caſtle of
<hi>Magdalen,</hi> than with his Death ſo dearly to have purchas'd ſo mean
a Poſt.</p>
            <p>But her Miſtake hath in it a farther Myſtery, tho' her Sight was
deceiv'd, ſhe thought not amiſs; For as our firſt Father in his State of
Innocence was plac'd in a Garden of Pleaſure, and his firſt Office was that
of a <hi>Gardiner</hi>; ſo the firſt Man that ever was in <hi>Glory,</hi>
appear'd firſt in a Garden, and preſented himſelf in the likeneſs of a
<hi>Gardiner,</hi> that the beginning of Glory might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that of
Innocence and Grace. And as that <hi>Gardiner</hi> was the foil of Mankind, the
Parent of Sin, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Death; ſo this was the Raiſer of our Ruins,
the Ranſom of our Offence, and the Reſtorer of Life. In a <hi>Garden,</hi>
Man was deceiv'd and enſnar'd by the Devil. In a Garden, <hi>Chriſt</hi>
was betray'd and apprehended by the <hi>Jews.</hi> In a Garden, <hi>Adam</hi>
was condemn'd to eat his Bread in the Sweat of his Brows; And after a Free-Gift
of the Bread of Angels in the laſt Supper, <hi>Chriſt</hi> did 
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0544000400:231"/> earn it us, with a <hi>Bloody Sweat</hi> of his whole
Body; And as by Diſobedient eating the Fruit of a <hi>Tree,</hi> our Right to
the Garden of Paradiſe was forfeited by <hi>Adam</hi>; ſo by the Obedient
Death of <hi>Chriſt upon a Tree,</hi> a far better Right is now ſettled;
And as when <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd in the Garden of Paradiſe, he was then
apparell'd in the Skin of a dead Beaſt, that his Cloathing might betoken his
Grave, and his Livery of Death agree with his Condemnation to Die; ſo to
defray the Debt of that Sin, in this Garden <hi>Chriſt</hi> lay clad in the
dead Man's Shrowd, and buried in his Tomb, that as our Evils began ſo they
might end, and ſuch Places and Means as were the Premiſes of our Miſery,
might be alſo the end of our Misfortune; and for theſe Reaſons <hi>Mary
Magdalen</hi> was allow'd to miſtake, that we might be inform'd of the
Myſtery, and ſee how aptly the Courſe of our Redemption did anſwer the
Proceſs of our Condemnation.</p>
            <p>But why could not <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> as well ſee what in truth
Chriſt was, as what in ſhow he ſeem'd to be? but ſhe thought ſo to
have found him as ſhe left him, and ſhe ſought him as ſhe ſaw him
laſt, being ſo overcome with Sorrow for his Death, that ſhe had neither
room <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0544000400:232"/> nor reſpite in her Mind, for any hope of his
Life, and therefore ſhe ask'd the <hi>Gardiner, If thou haſt carried him
hence, tell me where thou haſt laid him, and I will take him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But one would be ready to think her Maſter was very unkind to
leave her ſo long without Comfort, and to puniſh her ſo much, who ſo
well deſerv'd Pardon: She did not follow the Tide of his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fortune, to
ſhift ſail with the Stream; ſhe left him not in his loweſt Ebb, ſhe
revolted not from his laſt Extremity; in his Life ſhe ſerv'd him with her
Goods, in his Death ſhe departed not from his Croſs; and after Death ſhe
came to dwell with him in his Grave.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Chriſt</hi> begins to take Pity on her, her Tears were
too mighty Orators to let her Suit fall, tho' they pleaded at the moſt
rigorous Bar, they tie the Tongues of all Accuſers, and ſoften the rigour
of the ſevereſt Judge, they win the Invincible, and bind the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
when they ſeem moſt Pittiful, they have the greateſt Power, and being
moſt Forſaken, they are more Victorious: For this Water her Heart had been
long a Limbeck, ſometimes diſtilling it from the Weeds of her own Offences,
with the true Fire of Contrition, ſometimes <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0544000400:233"/> of the
Flowers of Spiritual Comforts, with the Flames of Contemplation; and at other
times out of the bitter Herbs of her Maſter's Miſeries, with the Heat of a
tender Compaſſion. Her Tears, that were heretofore the <hi>Proctors</hi>
for her Brother's Life, were now the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of thoſe Angels in the
Monument for her Comfort, and the Suiters that ſhall be rewarded with the
firſt Sight of her reviv'd Saviour. For when Chriſt ſaw all was in vain,
that neither Men nor Agels, nor himſelf (ſo long as he kept himſelf a
<hi>Gardiner</hi>) could get any Thing out of her, but that her Lord was gone,
he was taken away, and that nothing but <hi>Jeſus</hi> could yield her any
Comfort; He is no longer able to contain, but even diſcloſes himſelf, and
that by his Voice; And now <hi>Chriſt</hi> is found alive, that was ſought
Dead. A Cloud may be ſo thick as to hide the Sun from our Sight, the Sun
muſt ſcatter that Cloud and then we may ſee its Light: Here is an Example
of it: A thick Cloud of Heavineſs had ſo obſcured <hi>Mary
Magdalen</hi>'s Eyes, that ſhe could not ſee him thro' it, this one word,
theſe two Syllables <hi>Ma-ry</hi> from his Mouth diſpels all the
Darkneſs; no ſooner had his Voice ſounded in her Ears, but it drove away
all the Miſt, dries up <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0544000400:234"/> her Tears, opens her Eyes, and
ſhe knows him, and anſwer'd him with her wonted Salutation,
<hi>Rabboni:</hi> Thus the <hi>Gardiner</hi> did his Part, brought <hi>Mary
Magdalen</hi> from a dead and drooping, to a lively and cheerful Eſtate; She
ſought <hi>Chriſt</hi> dead and impriſon'd in a Stony-Grave, and finds
him both alive, and at full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; She ſought him in a Shroud more like a
Leper than himſelf, left as the Model of the utmoſt Miſery, and the only
Pattern of the bittereſt Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and now ſhe finds him inveſted
with Robes of Glory, the Owner and Giver of all Felicity. She that had ſo
long ſought without finding, wept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Comfort, and call'd without
Anſwer, is now fully ſatisfied with this one word, <hi>Mary,</hi> having
heard him call her in his wonted Manner, and uſual Voice, this one word
reſtor'd her Senſes, enlighten'd her Mind, quicken'd her Heart, and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd her Soul.</p>
            <p>But why did <hi>Chriſt</hi> chuſe to be made known to her by the
Ear, rather than by the Eye, by Hearing rather than by Appearing, becauſe her
Eyes were hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, till her Ears were open'd? The Philoſophers tell us,
<hi>Hearing</hi> is the Senſe of Wiſdom, and in Matters of Faith the
<hi>Ear</hi> goes firſt, and is of more uſe, and <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0544000400:235"/> to
be truſted before the <hi>Eye.</hi> No ſooner had <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Voice
ſounded in her Ears, but ſhe knew forthwith it was he; and being raviſh'd
with his Voice, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of Delays, a ſudden Joy ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt her,
by ſo unexpected a Preſence, and ſo many Miracles laid at once before
her, that ſhe could no more proceed in her own, than give <hi>Chriſt</hi>
leave to go forward with his Speech; but falling at his ſacred Feet, ſhe
offer'd to bath them with Tears of Joy, and to kiſs his late
<hi>grievous,</hi> but now <hi>moſt glorious</hi> Wounds. But Chriſt forbad
her, ſaying, <hi>Touch me not:</hi> This ſeem'd a ſtrange Rebuke to
<hi>Mary,</hi> who when dead in Sin, ſhe touch'd his mortal Feet, and now
being alive in Grace, ſhe was denied to touch his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Feet, being
commanded from that for which ſhe was before commended by our
<hi>Saviour.</hi> Alas! What Harm had there been if he had ſuffer'd her to
touch him? Before his Paſſion, many deſir'd and ſtrove to touch him,
and there went Virtue out of him, even while he was <hi>Mortal,</hi> but now he
was <hi>Immortal</hi> in all likelihood much more Virtue would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
Chriſt was not uſed to be ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of being touch'd; at ſeveral Times
and Places he ſuffer'd the rude Multitude to crowd and thruſt him, and much
ruder <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0544000400:236"/> Touches at his Paſſion: Why ſuffer'd he them
<hi>then,</hi> and why ſuffer'd he not her <hi>now?</hi> ſhe had touch'd
before both his Head and his Feet, and anointed them both, and ſhe now
brought Odours in her Hand to Re-embalm him; It was early, and yet by that time
ſhe had given very good Proofs of her Love: She was early up, came firſt to
the Grave, return'd and call'd <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> ſtaid laſt
at the Grave, had been at ſuch Coſt, taken ſuch Pains, had wept ſo much
as to refuſe Comfort, even when offer'd by Angels, till ſhe had found
<hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhe was a Stranger to Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and now having found
him, that ſhe muſt not touch him, ſeems very hard; one poor Touch had
been but an eaſie Recompence for all her Pains and Sorrow; But if we look
into the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives, it is yet more ſtrange, <hi>Touch
me not, for I am not yet aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> as if he had ſaid, when he was
Aſcended then ſhe ſhould; but if ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Earth by him, he is not
to be touch'd, when he is taken up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven no Arm can reach him there.</p>
            <p>There is a Time and Place for <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li me tangere.</hi> The World
began with a <hi>Noli me tangere.</hi> The firſt Words <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0544000400:237"/>
God ſpake then were, <hi>Touch not the forbidden Fruit</hi>: But Chriſt is
not the forbidden Tree but the Tree of Life, to be touch'd and taſted, that
we may live by him; but this <hi>touch me not</hi> was not on
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Part, but on <hi>Mary</hi>'s, no Lett in him to be touch'd,
the Lett was in her, ſhe might not touch him; would <hi>Chriſt</hi> have
Men to touch him, and not Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for St. <hi>Thomas</hi> put his whole Hand
into the Place of his Wounds, and put him to no Pain at all; and certain
<hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> met him in the way after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, amongſt which
was <hi>M. Magdalen,</hi> and he then ſuffer'd them to touch him, and take
him by the Feet: So that it ſeems this Prohibition was not Real but
Perſonal, not abſolutely but not at that time; which ſhews all was not
well with <hi>M. Magdalen,</hi> ſomething was amiſs, ſhe muſt have been
to blame in the Manner of her Offer; ſhe muſt have been a little too
forward it may be, and not have us'd all the Reſpect ſhe ſhould have
done: For as ſoon as <hi>Chriſt</hi> cry'd <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe anſwer'd,
with her wonted Term, <hi>Rabboni</hi>; and as ſhe ſaluted him with her
uſual Word, ſo after her Cuſtom ſhe went towards him, and would have
touch'd him, not in ſuch a Manner as was fitting to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, nor with
that Regard which his <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0544000400:238"/> new glorified Eſtate ſeem'd
juſtly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, for that which was enough to <hi>Chriſt</hi> a few Days
paſt, was not ſo now: She poor Woman was defective in her Judgment out of
an Exceſs of her Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſhe thought he had been <hi>Rabboni</hi>
ſtill: It ſeem'd to her that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was now as her Brother
<hi>Lazarus</hi> was after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had
riſen neither more nor leſs but juſt the ſame he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before, to be
ſaluted, approach'd, and touched as formerly he had been.</p>
            <p>It ſeems ſhe was not before ſo carry'd away with Sorrow, but
ſhe was now as far gone in the other of Joy, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got her ſelf in
offering to touch him no otherwiſe than ſhe did before: Her Caſe was like
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s in the Mount, who knew not what he ſaid, when he
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the building of three Tabernacles; ſhe knew not what ſhe did,
being ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd with the ſudden Joy, as ſhe had no Leiſure to
recollect her ſelf, to weigh the wonderful great Change this Day wrought in
him: For when her Judgment was better ſettled, ſhe did touch him but then
it was upon her Knees, down at his Feet, another manner of Geſture than as it
ſeems ſhe firſt offer'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis true he gave St. <hi>Thomas</hi> leave to touch, whoſe Faith
was in his Fingers <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0544000400:239"/> Ends; he then believ'd not, was in
Doubt, thought he had been a Ghoſt, and to clear that Doubt he was ſuffer'd
to touch him; St <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>M. Magdalen,</hi> or whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver touch'd
<hi>Chriſt</hi> on Earth, if they had not been more happy to touch him with
their <hi>Faith,</hi> than with their <hi>Hands,</hi> they had receiv'd no Good
at all by it; it was much better with Faith to touch the Hemm of his Garment,
than without it to touch any Part of his Body; touching was the proper Cure for
St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe; but ſo it was not for <hi>M.
Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> who was ſure the Voice ſhe heard was that of
<hi>Rabboni,</hi> ſhe had no need to be confirm'd in that. Her Diſeaſe
was of another Sort, not want of Faith, but want of due Regard; <hi>Thomas</hi>
touch'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he believ'd not, ſhe touch'd not becauſe ſhe
misbeliev'd; he touch'd that he might know Chriſt was riſen; ſhe touch'd
not that ſhe might know, he was not ſo riſen as ſhe imagin'd, that is
as in former times ſhe knew him. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> did hereby ſilently
tell her, there was a great Difference between a glorious and a mortal Body,
between the Condition of momentary and eternal Life, and that ſhe ſhould
rather with Reverence fall down afar off, than with ſuch Familiarity
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to touch him; that ſhe was firſt <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0544000400:240"/> to
embrace him with a firm Faith, then ſhe ſhould touch him with more worthy
<hi>Hands</hi>; and therefore he commanded her to go about that which requir'd
more haſte, to run to his Brethren and inform them, that he would go before
them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Galilee,</hi> and there they ſhould ſee him; and ſo <hi>M.
Magdalen,</hi> preferring her <hi>Lord</hi>'s Will to her own, obey'd his
Command in departing, but thought her ſelf but an unfortunate Meſſenger
of moſt joyful News, being baniſh'd from her Maſter's Preſence, to
carry News of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and going in this perplex'd Manner, ſhe
meets by the way the other holy Women, (who firſt came with her to the Grave)
whom the Angels had then aſſur'd of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection, and
as they all paſs'd towards the Diſciples, <hi>Jeſus</hi> met them,
ſaying, <hi>All Hayle, and ſo they came near, and took hold of his
Feet,</hi> and ador'd him; then he ſaid unto them, <hi>Fear not, go tell my
Brethren that I go into Galilee, there they ſhall ſee me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Chriſt apply'd a Lenitive to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage <hi>M.
Magdalen</hi>'s Pain, after the ſharp Corroſive which had griev'd her
tender Wound, which was made rather by Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance than Error, and was as ſoon
cur'd as known, and therefore ſhe was now admitted to kiſs his Feet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0544000400:241"/>She had indeed great Favours granted her, not
only to ſee Angels, but to ſee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and him firſt of all;
and more than that, to be employ'd by <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon a heavenly Errand,
and no Reaſon for this but that ſhe lov'd much. We cannot ſay ſhe
believ'd much, ſince ſhe believ'd no more than juſt as much as the
<hi>High Prieſt</hi> would have the World believe, that he was taken away by
Night: Her Faith cannot be commended, but her Love cannot but be prais'd, of
which ſhe gave good Proofs to <hi>Chriſt</hi> both living and dead. St.
<hi>Auguſtin</hi> tells us the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffer'd her
not to touch him, was to wean her from all ſenſual and fleſhly touching,
to teach her a new and true Touch; for her touching of his Body, which ſhe
deſir'd, would laſt but forty Days, and he therefore taught her another
Touch, that might ſerve to the World's End.</p>
            <p>But St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her
to touch him, was to ſave Time, he being deſirous to diſpatch her upon an
Errand better pleaſing to him, and that requir'd more haſte; he was
care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that his Friends might receive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort with the firſt, and
therefore he bids her go with all ſpeed, for that it would do <hi>them</hi>
more good, to hear of his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0544000400:242"/> than it would do
<hi>her</hi> to ſtand and touch him. It was a great Honour to <hi>Mary
Magdalen,</hi> to be the Meſſenger of theſe bleſſed Tydings, there is
no harſh Term in this Meſſage; for tho' his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples fled from him,
forſook him, and forſwore him, he hath forgotten and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given all, he does
not caſt them off, as they did him, but ſends to them by the Name of
<hi>Brethren:</hi> But this ſpecial Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that was done to <hi>Mary
Magdalen,</hi> was withall a ſilent blaming the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for ſitting
at Home ſo drooping in a Corner, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> not finding any of
them, is feign to ſeek a new <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and finding her where he
ſhould have found them and did not, to ſend to them by the Hand of her whom
he firſt found at the Sepulcher, and by this <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> ought to
be ſatisfied; for to be thus ſent to be the Meſſenger of theſe
bleſſed Tydings is a more ſpecial Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done to her, than if ſhe had
been let alone, and been admitted to touch <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which ſhe ſo
eagerly deſir'd; for we may be ſure <hi>Chriſt</hi> would never have
enjoyn'd her to leave the better and take the worſe, to forbear to touch him,
to make the more haſte to them, if that had not then been the better
Employment. The Reaſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> bids her go and tell them,
<hi>That I aſcend,</hi> was, becauſe <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0544000400:243"/> he knew they
would ſay, Oh! He is riſen, We ſhall have his Company again as we had
before; but by ſending them word of his Aſcending, he gave them warning
betimes, that he Roſe not to make any Abode with them, or to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with
them on Earth, as formerly he had done. He knew this would be a hard
Leſſon, and would trouble them much, for they were ſtill over addicted to
his Bodily Being with them; here they would have detain'd him, built him a
Tabernacle here, and by their good Will, would never have let him go from
hence.</p>
            <p>This was their Error, and to rid them of this Earthly Mind, thus
ſtriving to affix him, and keep him here on Earth, he ſhews them they were
much miſtaken, and ſets them right: When <hi>Chriſt</hi> was riſen, he
was not far from aſcending, and if we be riſen with him, we muſt no more
look down into the Grave, nor fix our ſelves on Earth, but ſtrive to
aſcend with him alſo.</p>
            <p>All Things in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> do ſo, riſing
they aſcend preſently: In <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> the <hi>Stars</hi> are no
ſooner riſen above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> but they are in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and never leave aſcending, till they come to the higheſt <hi>Vertical</hi>
Point. In <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0544000400:244"/> 
               <hi>Earth,</hi> the little Spires that peep
out of the Ground now at this Time (Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's time of her Yearly
Reſurrection) they are no ſooner out but up they ſhoot, and never leave
to aſpire till they have attain'd the full Pitch of the Growth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd them
by Nature; ſo ſhould we from our Birth always aſcend, nor ever ſtop,
till we reach the higheſt Perfection our Nature is capable of.</p>
            <p>In our ſelves it is not ſtrange for earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men to have earthly
Minds, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Clay for our Original, that our Souls ſhould cleave to the
Duſt; ſo it is with us, tho' ſo it ought not to be: The very <hi>Heathen
Poet</hi> ſaw, that tho' we be made <hi>of</hi> Earth, we are not made
<hi>for</hi> Earth: That an <hi>Heavenly Soul</hi> was not put into an
<hi>earthly Body,</hi> to the end the earthly Body ſhould draw it down to the
<hi>Earth</hi>; but rather that the Soul ſhould lift it up to Heaven, and
ſo much is ſhewn by our <hi>os ſublime &amp; vultus ad ſydera,</hi> the
very Frame of our Body that bears us up thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward; for tho' we are born in
this World and live in it, yet we belong to another Corporation, we are
Denizens of another Country, and Free of that <hi>City</hi> which is above,
whoſe Builder is the <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0544000400:245"/>Thus we ſee by what happened to <hi>Mary
Magdalen,</hi> and the other devour Women, that they were not only capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of
Religious Offices, but that they were <hi>early</hi> in their Religious Work,
they began <hi>betimes.</hi> There is but one <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> that tells us,
That they that came <hi>late</hi> to the Labour, were as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded as the
<hi>earlieſt,</hi> and that is no Encouragement to late Comers, as not ſo
much reſpecting the different Ages of a Man, but different Year of the World.
And let that <hi>Parable</hi> be underſtood after the Vulgar way of
interpreting it, yet we ſhould remember that theſe that were call'd at the
laſt Hours came as ſoon as they were call'd. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and
theſe Women, were alſo earneſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous; and tho' their Devotion
was carried upon Things that could not be intirely done, yet <hi>God</hi>
caſt no Cloud of Diſcouragement upon them, but exalted and maintain'd their
Holy Confidence, and accepted their Devotion; for where the Root and
Subſtance of the Work is Piety, <hi>God</hi> often overlooks ſome Errors in
Circumſtance as inconſiderable.</p>
            <p>Let therefore <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> be our Pattern, let us learn
from her, that we may find <hi>Chriſt</hi>; if we ſeek him <hi>early</hi>
and diligently, we ſhall meet him: Let <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0544000400:246"/> us learn of her
to fear no Dangers in queſt of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to think of no
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts without him; let us riſe with her in the Morning of our good
Motions, and let them not ſleep in Sloath, when Diligence may execute them;
let us run with Repentance to our ſinful Hearts, which inſtead of being
<hi>Temples</hi> (thro' our Faults) are become <hi>Tombs</hi> to
<hi>Chriſt:</hi> Let us roll away the Stone of our former Hardneſs, remove
all heavy Loads of <hi>Sin</hi> that oppreſs us, and look into our Souls,
whether we can there find <hi>Chriſt</hi>; If he be not there within us, let
us ſtand Weeping without, and ſee him in other Creatures; ſeek him, and
not his, ſeek him for himſelf, and not for his Gifts; If our <hi>Faith</hi>
have found <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a Cloud, let our <hi>Hope</hi> ſeek to ſee
him: If our <hi>Hope</hi> hath led us to ſee him, let our <hi>Love</hi>
ſeek farther into him: Let us ſeek him truly, and no other for him; ſeek
him purely, and no other Thing with him; ſeek him only, and nothing beſides
him; and if at the firſt Search he appear not, think not much to perſevere
in Tears, and to continue our ſeeking as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> did. Let us
ſtand upon the Earth, tread under us all worldly Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and touch them
only with the Soals of our Feet; that is, with the loweſt 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0544000400:247"/> and leaſt part of our Affections; and to look better
into the <hi>Tomb,</hi> let us bow down our Necks to the Yoak of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that with lowly Looks we may find him, whom ſwelling and haughty Thoughts
have driven away: And if we can perceive in the Tombs of our Hearts, the
Preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s two firſt Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; that is, at the
Feet, Sorrow for the bad that is paſt; and at the Head, Deſire to a better
that is to come; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them with Sighs, and welcome them with Penitent
Tears, and let us not ceaſe ſeeking till we find <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus preparing our ſelves with Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, coming with Speed,
ſtanding with fix'd Hopes, and ſtooping with humble Hearts, if we crave
with <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> no other Thing of Jeſus but <hi>Jeſus</hi>
himſelf, he will anſwer our Tears with his Preſence, and continue with us
for ever.</p>

they were a crafty and ſubtil Generation of Men, and ſo perverſe even to

Affections and Eſtimations of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulacy, <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0544000400:252"/> that
their good or ill Word was enough to make or blaſt any one with the People,
who implicitely would believe them, let their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port be never ſo falſe or
malicious:"</q> Certain it is, They were infinitely Proud and Inſolent, Surly
and Ill-natur'd, they hated all Mankind but themſelves, and cenſur'd
thoſe who would not be of their Opinion and Way, as Reprobates. They were
extream zealous to gather Proſelytes to their Party, not to make them more
Religious, but more fierce and cruel, (much like ſome, who think all
<hi>Religion</hi> confin'd within the Bounds of their own Sect, that none but
they were the Godly, and that all other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were <hi>Sons of the

their Party with a mighty Zeal and Fervency againſt all that differed from
them; ſo that if any did but ſpeak a good Word of our Bleſſed Saviour,

            <p>Theſe dogged and ill-natur'd Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, together with their

outward Inſtances of Religion, as frequent Faſting, long Praying, with
demure and mortify'd Looks, in a whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and affected Tone. <hi>Saul</hi> was
deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leavened with the active and fiery Genius of this Sect, not able to
bear with any oppoſite Party in Religion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if late or new;
inſomuch, that when the <hi>Jews</hi> were reſolved to do Execution upon
St. <hi>Stephen, Saul</hi> ſtood by and kept the Cloaths of them that did it;
whether he was any farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in his Death, we know not; but this was
enough, loudly to proclaim his Approbation and Conſent, for <hi>God</hi>
chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpects the Heart; and if the Vote be paſſed there, that writes
the Man guilty, tho' he ſtirs no farther, it being eaſie to murther a Man
by a ſilent Wiſh, or a paſſionate Deſire. In all Moral Actions,
<hi>God</hi> judges by the Will, and reckons the Man a Companion in the Sin,
who, tho' poſſibly he may never actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally join in it, does yet inwardly
applaud and like it.</p>
            <p>The Storm thus begun, increas'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, and a violent Perſecution

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0544000400:254"/> Zeal, ſearching out the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> beating
them in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling many to Blaſpheme, impriſoning
others, and procuring their Death: He was a ſort of <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> to
the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> by whom he was employ'd to find out thoſe
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> who preach'd againſt the <hi>Law</hi> of

<hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> he addreſſed himſelf to the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi>
and there took out a Commiſſion to go down and ranſack the
<hi>Synagogue</hi> at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where many <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
that were perſecuted fled for Shelter, <hi>Saul</hi> reſolving to bring up
thoſe he found there to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in order to their Puniſhment
and Execution: But <hi>God</hi> who deſigned him for a Work of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nature, ſtopt him in his Journey; for as he was travelling with his
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions upon the Road, not far from <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> on a ſudden, a
Gleam of Light, which exceeded the Splendor of the Sun, darted from Heaven upon
them, whereat being very ſtrangely amaz'd and confounded, they all fell to
the Ground, and a Voice call'd to him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Saul, Saul, Why
perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> To which he reply'd, <hi>Lord, Who art thou?</hi>
Who told him, He was <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom he perſecuted, becauſe what was 
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0544000400:255"/> done to the Members, was done to the Head, that it was
hard for him to kick againſt the Pricks: That he now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to him, to
make Choice of him for an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and Witneſs of what he had now
ſeen, and ſhould after hear, that he would ſtand by him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
him, and make him a glorious Inſtrument for the Converſion of the
<hi>Gentiles:</hi> This ſaid, he asked our <hi>Lord,</hi> What he would have
him to do? Who bad him go into the <hi>City,</hi> where he ſhould receive his
Anſwer. <hi>Saul</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who were preſent at this

Ignorant of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Language, wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpoke to
<hi>Saul,</hi> they heard the Words, but knew not the Meaning of them.</p>
            <p>Thus, when <hi>Saul</hi> was waſting the <hi>Church,</hi>
diſperſing the Diſciples, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Chriſtians, following them
from the <hi>Synagogues</hi> into the Streets, from thence into their Houſes,
when he breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out Threatnings and Slaughter; the <hi>Lord</hi> without any

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0544000400:256"/> of Wrath againſt him: But if ever <hi>Mercy</hi> and
<hi>Judgment</hi> met together, here it was, <hi>Judicium miſericordiae,
&amp; miſericordia judicis,</hi> a Voice and a Stroak, the one ſtriking
down to <hi>Earth,</hi> the other lifting up to <hi>Heaven,</hi> a Light
ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and a Light ſhining to direct him to
<hi>Heaven,</hi> a Light ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him that was in Darkneſs and in the
Shadow of Death, to bring him from the Snare of Darkneſs into the glorious
Liberty of the Sons of <hi>God:</hi> He that was the <hi>Way</hi> met him in
the <hi>Way,</hi> he that was the <hi>Light</hi> met him with a <hi>Light,</hi>
he that was the <hi>Word</hi> met him with the Voice of a Word, <hi>Saul, Saul,
Why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt thou me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a gracious Favour of the <hi>Lord</hi> to vouchſafe to
Queſtion with him; but to call him by his Name, and to inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate that Name,
that was a ſign of his great Affection and Commiſeration: It was a Voice
indeed, the Voice of the <hi>Lord,</hi> mighty in Operation: This Voice
ſtruck him from his Horſe to the <hi>Earth,</hi> ſtruck him from his
Preſumption, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt thou me?</hi> Yet the Voice was not more
<hi>Powerful</hi> than <hi>Merciful:</hi> It was (as <hi>Chryſologus</hi>
ſays) <hi>Suaviter fortis, &amp; fortiter ſuavis</hi>; the heavieſt Fall,
and yet the happieſt Fall that ever any had; <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0544000400:257"/> it was
his Fall and his Riſing. Thus a Dumbneſs unto <hi>Zachary,</hi> was not a
dumb Inſtructor, it taught him Faith againſt another time; ſo
<hi>Blindneſs</hi> ſent unto <hi>Saul,</hi> took away his
<hi>Blindneſs,</hi> making him ſee more in the Ways of Life, than all his
Learning gather'd at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> could have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto
him</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi> by this time was gotten up, but tho' he found his
<hi>Feet,</hi> he loſt his <hi>Eyes,</hi> being ſtruck Blind with the
extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Brightneſs of the <hi>Light,</hi> and was therefore led by his

that he had the Viſion and Extaſie mention'd by him.</p>
            <p>There was at this time at <hi>Damaſcus, Ananias,</hi> one of the

<hi>Chriſt</hi> appear'd, and directed him to the Street and Houſe where
<hi>Saul</hi> of <hi>Tarſus</hi> then Lodged, who was then at Prayers, and
had ſeen him in a Viſion coming to him, to lay his Hands upon him, that he
might receive his Sight; <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0544000400:258"/> 
               <hi>Ananias</hi> ſtartled at
the Name of <hi>Saul,</hi> having heard of his bloody Temper and Practices,
knowing upon what Errand he was come to that City, was ſore afraid: But
<hi>Jeſus</hi> quickly made his Fears vaniſh, by telling him he miſtook
the Man, that he was now become a choſen Veſſel to Preach the
<hi>Goſpel</hi> both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and before the
greateſt <hi>Potentates</hi> of the Earth, telling him what great Things he
ſhould do and ſuffer for his Sake. Hereupon <hi>Ananias</hi> went
forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to him, laid his Hands upon him, and told him, <hi>Jeſus</hi> had
ſent him to him, that he might receive his Sight, and be filled with the
<hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which was no ſooner ſaid but done, and thick Films
like Scales fell from his <hi>Eyes,</hi> and his <hi>Sight</hi> return'd; then
he was Baptiz'd and ſolemnly initiated into the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi>;
after which, he ſoon joyn'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Diſciples of that Place, to
the great Joy and Wonder of the <hi>Church,</hi> that the <hi>Wolf</hi>
ſhould ſo ſoon become a <hi>Lamb.</hi> He that was the Mouth of
Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, is become the Mouth of Chriſt: He that was the Inſtrument of
<hi>Satan,</hi> the Organ of the Holy Ghoſt: As ſays St.
<hi>Chryſoſtome, Being yet upon the Earth, he is an Angel; and being yet
but a Man, he is already in Heaven.</hi> What was <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0544000400:259"/> done
upon him wrought upon all the World; he was ſtruck Blind, and all the World
ſaw the better for it.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> calls him a <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal
Prieſt,</hi> that Sacrificed not <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Goats,</hi> but even
himſelf; and not only that prepar'd the whole World as a Sacrifice to
<hi>God,</hi> but ſo abſolutely did he Sacrifice himſelf and his State in
this World, as that he choſe rather to be <hi>Anathema,</hi> ſeparated from
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> than that they ſhould; but whether that was not out of an
over vehement and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Zeal to his Bretheren, is too <hi>high</hi>
a Point for me to undertake to judge.</p>
            <p>After theſe Words, <hi>Saul, Saul, Why perſecuteſt thou
me?</hi> he was no longer <hi>Saul,</hi> there was an immediate change of
Affections: Here's another manner of Lycanthropy, than when a Lamb is made a
Wolf; for here is a Wolf made a Lamb, a Bramble is made a Vine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Tares become good Wheat, and the laſt is made firſt: He that was Born out
of Time, hath not only the Perfection, but the Excellency of all his
Lineaments. <hi>Saul</hi> was breathing Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Slaughter againſt
the <hi>Church,</hi> when he was in the height of his Fury, <hi>Chriſt</hi>
laid hold on him; this was for the <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0544000400:260"/> moſt part
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Method of Curing: When the <hi>Sea</hi> was in a
tempeſtuous Rage, when the Waters cover'd the Ship, and even ſhaked that
which could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Mountains, even the Faith of the Diſciples, then
<hi>Chriſt</hi> rebukes the Wind and commands a <hi>Calm</hi>: When the
<hi>Sun</hi> was gone out as a <hi>Gyant</hi> to run his Courſe, (as
<hi>David</hi> ſpeaks) then <hi>God</hi> by the Mouth of another
<hi>Joſuah,</hi> bids the <hi>Sun</hi> ſtand ſtill: When the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Spirit foam'd and fum'd, tore and rent the poſſeſſed Perſons, then
<hi>Chriſt</hi> commanded them to go out: <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtaid not here
till <hi>Saul</hi> being made drunk with Blood was caſt into a Slumber, as
ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Blood of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in the midſt of his
Fit Chriſt gave him Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, in the heat of his Madneſs he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
him.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this Evidence againſt himſelf, <hi>I
perſecuted this way unto Death</hi>; What could he ſay more againſt
himſelf? And then ſays <hi>Chriſt</hi> to this Tempeſt be
<hi>quiet,</hi> to this glaring <hi>Sun</hi> ſtand <hi>ſtill,</hi> to this
unclean Spirit <hi>come forth</hi> And in this Senſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls
himſelf <hi>aborti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum,</hi> a Perſon born out of Seaſon: For whereas the
other <hi>Diſciples</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had a ſort of a Growth
under <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and were firſt his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and after
his <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was born a Man, an 
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0544000400:261"/> Apoſtle, not carved out as the reſt in Time, but an
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> poured out, and caſt in a Mould, as <hi>Adam</hi> was a
perfect Man in an inſtant; ſo was St <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle, ſo
ſoon as <hi>Chriſt</hi> took him in Hand: For St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not in
the Number of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> at the Deſcent the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt</hi>; But then he had more than an equivalent Evidence of his
Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; For when he travel'd from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to
<hi>Damaſcus,</hi> the Heavens were open'd, and our <hi>Bleſſed
Saviour</hi> himſelf ſpake to him, whereupon the Company were
aſtoniſhed, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtruck Blind with the Glory of the
Viſion; and afterwards being cured by a Miracle at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> he
had no Aſſiſtance from the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> his
Inſtructions came all from <hi>Chriſt</hi> immediately. And it cannot be
deny'd that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in ſome Kind, and upon ſome Subjects, is as
Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent as ever Man was, not inferior to <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> whom ſome
think he had read, or ſome other excellent <hi>Orators.</hi> His Speech to
<hi>Agrippa</hi> hath as much Force and Addreſs, and much more Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Mind and noble Freedom, than any thing we meet with in the beſt of the
Heathen <hi>Orators:</hi> 'Tis true, the Advantage of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Education was great, he had his <hi>Cauſe</hi> and his <hi>Maſter</hi> to
aſſiſt him, but yet he met with great <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0544000400:262"/> Difficulties
and Hazards in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Function: For he was to oppoſe the
Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to alter the Cuſtoms which <hi>Moſes</hi>
had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and to decry the Expectation of a <hi>Temporal
Meſſiah</hi>; he charged them with the higheſt Crimes imaginable, and
told them plainly, That they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World,
and kill'd the <hi>Prince of Life:</hi> And this he told the obſtinate
<hi>Jews,</hi> who were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Prejudice, and bigotted to Error and
Superſtition, for which they pleaded Antiquity: St. <hi>Paul</hi> declar'd to
the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom they had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd was
rais'd from the Dead, was a <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> and that it
was from <hi>him</hi> they were to expect Remiſſion of their Sins; with
this ſevere ſharpneſs St. <hi>Paul</hi> treated <hi>Faelix</hi> Viceroy
of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> to whom he talked ſo freely and ſo pertinently, that
the Viceroy forgot his Character, and <hi>trembled</hi> before him.</p>
            <p>And yet the Truth is, the Beginnings of our <hi>Religion</hi> were
very unpromiſing; the firſt Undertakers began with a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Force, and
there was a ſtrange Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion between the Cauſe and the Effect; for
humanly ſpeaking, if <hi>twelve private Men</hi> ſhould now make an
Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> they would in all Probility
be as likely to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0544000400:263"/> as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
were in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize when our <hi>Saviour</hi> left them. But herein
certainly the Providence of God, for the Prevention of all Doubts and Scruples
was great, in that he would not lay the Foundation of <hi>Chriſtian
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> as not in the force of Arms, ſo neither of Eloquence and
artificial Speech, which is often inſiſted upon by St. <hi>Paul, Not with
Wiſdom, nor the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Speech, nor with enticing Words:</hi> And it
is worthy our Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, how it was poſſible for a few poor Men,
ſo low in <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> to break through the
Oppoſition of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> bafle their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
deſpiſe their Powers, and make them renounce their <hi>Ancient</hi> Belief,
and that Life they were moſt in love with. But tho' they were ſhort in
their natural Capacities, their wonderful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is an undeniable Proof of
a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power</hi> that aſſiſted them; as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſologus</hi>
moſt admirably tells us. <hi>Petrus &amp; Andreas, Jacobus &amp; Joannes,

Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Now to magnifie his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> more
particularly to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and to take away all Occaſion of
Deſpair, <hi>Chriſt</hi> did upon ſo many great Diſadvantages draw St.
<hi>Paul</hi> to him, whom he brought to that remarkable height on a ſudden,
that the <hi>Church</hi> celebrates the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of no Man but this: She
does not conſider the <hi>Martyrs</hi> as Born till they Die, till the World
ſee how they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever'd to the End, ſhe takes no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them:
Wherefore ſhe calls the Days of their <hi>Death,</hi> their
<hi>Birth-Days:</hi> She does not reckon they are <hi>Born</hi> till they
<hi>Die:</hi> But of St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhe makes aſſur'd the firſt Day,
nay the firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0544000400:265"/> the firſt Moment, and
therefore celebrates his <hi>Converſion</hi> only. And as <hi>Chriſt</hi>
dealt with St <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo <hi>God</hi> deals with <hi>us,</hi> he will
firſt caſt us down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will raiſe us up, he will firſt break us
before he will make us in his Faſhion. The <hi>Lord</hi> only knows how to
Wound us out of Love, more than that how to Wound us into Love, not only with
him that Wounds us, but into Love with the Wound it ſelf, with the very
Affliction that he inflicts upon us. The <hi>Lord</hi> knows how to ſtrike us
ſo, that we ſhall lay hold on the Hand that ſtrikes us, and kiſs the
Inſtrument that wounds us: <hi>God</hi> brings to the Gate of <hi>Death,</hi>
and by that Gate he leads us to eternal Life: He kills us here that we may live
for ever; he puts us low here that we may be exalted hereafter: And he hath not
diſcover'd, but made that Northern Paſſage to paſs from that <hi>Frozen
Sea</hi> of Calamity and Tribulation, to the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
There are ſome Fruits that ripen not without <hi>Froſts</hi>; there are
ſome Natures that diſpoſe not themſelves to <hi>God</hi> but by
<hi>Afflictions</hi>; And as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> looks for the Seaſon, and does
not produce any Thing before; ſo <hi>Grace</hi> looks for the
<hi>Aſſent</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and does not perfect the
<hi>whole</hi> Work, till <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0544000400:266"/> that come. It is
<hi>Nature</hi> that brings the Seaſon, but <hi>Grace</hi> the
<hi>Aſſent,</hi> and till the Seaſon for the Fruit, till the Aſſent
of the Soul come, all is not done.</p>
            <p>This ſhould be our <hi>Conſolation,</hi> that how low ſoever
<hi>God</hi> is pleas'd to caſt us, tho' it be to the <hi>Earth,</hi> yet he
doth not do it to caſt us down, but to bring us home. And <hi>Death</hi> it
ſelf is not ſo much a <hi>baniſhing</hi> us out of this World, as it is a
Viſitation of our <hi>Friends</hi> that lie in the <hi>Earth</hi>; neither
are any nearer of Kin to us than the Earth it ſelf, and the Worms of the
<hi>Earth.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>BSERVING the ſeveral Alterations in Nobility, we ſhall find
Four Principal Actors on the Theatres of Great Families: The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner,
Advancer, Continuer, and Ruiner. The Beginner, is he, who either by his
Virtues, Merits, or Riches, refineth himſelf from the Droſs of the Vulgar,
and layeth the Foundation of his Houſe: An excellent Workman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who not
only brings his Tools, but maketh his Materials: But yet An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Nobility
ſeems no juſt Ground to be Proud, and have a high Opinion of our ſelves,
becauſe it's borrow'd. Thoſe great Actions, wherein we had no Share, cannot
be any part of our Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially if we have not Abilities to
imitate them; 
<q> 
                  <l>Et genus &amp; proavos &amp; quae non ferimus ipſi,</l> 
                  <l>Vix ea noſtra voco.</l>
               </q> 
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0544000400:268"/> That Man
muſt be very Poor, who hath nothing of his own to appear in, but muſt Patch
up his Pedigree with the Relicks of the Dead, and with the Tomb-ſtones and
Monuments of his Anceſtors. Next comes the Advancer of Nobility, who improves
the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Honour he receiveth, and what his Anceſtor found Glaſs
and made Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, he finds Cryſtal and makes it Pearl: Indeed, if a Man
could bequeath his Virtues, Merits and Courage, by Will, and ſettle his good
Senſe, Learning and Reſolution, upon his Children, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as he can
his Lands, a brave An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor would be a mighty Privilege and great Advantage
to his Poſterity. Next is the Continuer of Nobility, who keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his
Nobility alive, and paſſes it to his Children, neither marring nor mending
it, but ſends it to his Son as he receiv'd it from his Father: Now this
Advantage only by Birth is often the effect of a Sloathful and Effeminate Life,
when Men will attempt nothing, either in the Field, or in their Cloſets; when
they will neither Trouble themſelves with Study; nor be contented to expoſe
themſelves to the Weather, which Lazineſs renders them inſignificant to
the great Purpoſes of Life; ſuch Men think it a great <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0544000400:269"/> Addition to their Birth, to ſtand at the Bottom of a long
Parchment Pedigree, and that their Blood hath run through the Channels of
Honour for many Ages: But alas! This Antiquity conſiſts only in the
continual Frugality of the Family, who being once poſſeſt of an Eſtate,
had the Diſcretion to keep it, and ſo hath the Advantage of Living in a
better Houſe, and Eating and Drinking better than thoſe who want a Fortune.
Indeed, if Ancient Nobility did convey to us any Advantage of Body or Mind, and
that every Generation grew wiſer, ſtronger, handſomer, or longer-liv'd
than other; if the Breed of a Man's Family were thus improv'd, then indeed the
Quality of their Arms would be contrary to their Cloaths, the one would always
grow better, the other worſe for Wearing. The laſt is the Ruiner of
Families, who baſely degenerates from his Anceſtors; ſo that Nobility in
him hath run ſo far from its firſt Starting that it's tired, and whilſt
he lives he is no better than his Grandfather's Tomb, without carv'd over with
honourable Titles, within full of Emptineſs and Corruption: Such noble Men as
theſe laſt, look upon it as one of the beſt Perfections of Nature, to
Dreſs themſelves well, and to come <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0544000400:270"/> handſomly into
a Room; but let me tell theſe Ceremony-Gentlemen, that I think it much
better, that a Man's Parts ſhould lie in his Head rather than in his Heels.
Indeed, in ſome Perſons well-born there is a peculiar Nobleneſs of Temper
in them. A Man may diſtinguiſh their Quality by the Air of their Faces,
which are good Accompliſhments, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to Company with ſome
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; but then Men muſt not be fond of theſe ſmall Formalities, nor
magnifie them too much. I know in <hi>England,</hi> that a plain Gentleman of
an ancient Family is accounted a Perſon of better Quality than a new made
Knight, tho' the Reaſon of their Knighthood was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Meritorious; and
therefore many ſuch Gentlemen have refus'd to be Knighted, but I think they
were much in the wrong: For the Reaſon why thoſe who are placed in that
Degree of Honour, precede others who are afterwards rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſame
height, is for Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Induſtry, to make Men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to exert
their earlieſt Endeavours to deſerve well of the Prince or State. It is but
reaſonable, that Merit ſhould be conſider'd, of what Date ſoever it is,
and a worthy Action ought as well to be conſider'd and rewarded, as one 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0544000400:271"/> of the ſame Kind was a thouſand Years ſince: If
the Inheritors of Ancient Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour have not by Perſonal Additions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
that Stock which was granted to their Anceſtors, there is no Reaſon it
ſhould be valued above the ſame Degree (Precedency excepted) which is given
now: For to affirm, That a Family rais'd to Nobility by King <hi>Charles</hi>
or King <hi>James,</hi> is not as good as one rais'd by the Conqueror, is a
Reflection upon thoſe Kings; and it ſuppoſes their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and
Authority leſs conſiderable, and that the Fountain of Honour is dried up.
Honour is not like <hi>China</hi> Diſhes, which muſt lie ſome Ages under
Ground before it comes to any Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In taking a true Eſteem of
No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, we are not ſo much to conſider its Antiquity, as the Merit of
him to whom it was firſt granted, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction which the Prince put
upon it.</p>
            <p>No Man will affirm an old Shilling to be better than a new
Half-Crown, or an old braſs Medal dug out of the Ground long ſince, to be
more Valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the ſame Weight in Gold. If a Man were to pay a Debt, the
late King <hi>James</hi>'s Image upon a Piece of Gold would be more
ſerviceable to him than <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s old Coins, which are only valu'd 
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0544000400:272"/> for their Uſefulneſs, becauſe they often rectify
Chronology, and explain Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and retrieve us ſeveral material Parts of
Learning, which had otherwiſe been loſt.</p>
            <p>Conquerors made Soldiers ambitious to follow them, by ſharing the
Fruits of their Conqueſts with them; and when their Succeſſors had not
Eſtates ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Reward all the glorious Actions and eminent Services
which Perſons did for them, being perſuaded that a Man of Courage values
nothing ſo much as Honour, which diſtinguiſhes him from other Men, they
invented Knighthood, which without exhauſting their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, would gain
them the Honour of their Subjects, and inflame all others with an extream
Deſire to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthy of the ſame Honour; and it was for this
Reaſon that they created Knights, either juſt before the Battle to make
them ingage more reſolutely, or preſently after it, to recompence thoſe
that had the greateſt Hand in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. Thus Nobility is a Quality
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd by virtuous Actions and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Services, which ſome Perſons
have performed to the Prince and State; and tho' Fortune ſhould have more
Influence than Merit, upon the diſpenſing of theſe <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0544000400:273"/>
Qualities, yet the ſame Judgment is ſtill to be made, becauſe Princes are
ſubject to their Paſſions, rewarding more boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and raiſing
higher ſome of their Servants than others: But if a Man be advanced for
engaging himſelf in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Quarrel, he hath no better Pretence to
Honour than a reſolute Highwayman may challenge; and the Marks of all Favours
that either come by ſervile Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, or a dextrous Application to the Vices
of their Princes, are rather infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous than honourable to their Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
being enobled for thoſe Qualities for which they ſhould have been
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd: It is a leſſening to a Man's No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility when the Reaſons or
Grounds of it are unknown, and when the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Honour happen to
be thus Courſe and Counterfeit, 'tis not in the Power of Time to mend them,
when the Riſe of a Family is owing to ſuch an Original; a Man has a
particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not to flouriſh too much upon the Gifts of his Fortune,
ſince there is ſo much Alloy in it. Nobility rais'd by Arms, when lawfully
undertaken, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly more great than that which comes by Commerce. The
Profeſſion of a Soldier has a particular Title to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: It is more Noble
than the reſt; <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0544000400:274"/> and no wiſe Man will ever envy or
leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the juſt Character of Military Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: The Courage of a Soldier
does his Country not much Service after his Death; the Conſequences of his
Valour ſeldom reach beyond his Death; ſo there are few the better for it
except thoſe he engages for. A Martial Man, unleſs poliſh'd by Learning,
is uſually ſour in his Behaviour. The old Heroes were none of the
genteeleſt Men; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi> tho' a great Soldier, was very rugged and
moroſe in his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Advantages of Learning are certainly very
great; without ſome ſhare of this, War it ſelf cannot be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
nay, without the Aſſiſtance of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, a Man can never be qualified for
any conſiderable Poſt in the Camp. For Courage without Conduct is not fit
to Command, and many times does more hurt than good. It is Learning that
teaches a General the Succeſſes and Events of Actions in former Ages: It
inſtructs him how to take Advantage of his Enemies, and to avoid thoſe
Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages which have been fatal to others before him: It teaches him how
to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and Aſſault, how to manage the Difference of Ground and
Weather; <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0544000400:275"/> and the Advantages of Learning are more
laſting than thoſe of Arms. Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Commander is like a Diamond
ſet in Gold: I do not intend that a Commander ſhould be verſed in thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
School-Queſtions, but in Hiſtory, which is a ſilent Study and reſerv'd
Work: Thoſe that are not verſed in it, have Cricks in their Necks, and
can't look backward, nor ſee behind them the Actions which long ſince were
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: Hiſtory makes a young Man to be old, without gray Hairs, being
privileged with the Experience of Age, without the Infirmities or
Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences thereof: Nay, it is not only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Things paſt, preſent,
but inables one to make a rational Conjecture of Things to come: For this World
affords no new Accidents, but in the ſame Senſe wherein we call it a New
Moon, which is the Old one in another ſhape, and yet no other than what hath
been formerly. Old Actions return again, furbiſhed over with ſome new and
diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are only Continuers of their Honour or Nobility,
deceive the Deſires and Hopes of their Friends: Good is not good, when
proceeding <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0544000400:276"/> from them, from whom far better is expected.
Youthful Virtues are ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, that they cannot come off at riper Age
with Credit, without perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething that may advance the Honour of
their Family, and build their Houſes one Story higher than they found
them.</p>
            <p>If our Anceſtors have gain'd Honour by the War, we ſhould
enquire whether it were in a juſt Cauſe, and whether Enterprizes or
Advantages were gain'd by Bravery, or whether by Chance or Treachery; for a
great many Perſons have ventur'd far, and yet continue in their firſt
Obſcurity; and I have known ſome in my Time, that are now grown great Men,
only by having the good Fortune to fall under the Notice of their General, and
being ſent by him with the good News of a Victory, they have been highly
Rewarded and Advanced. Such Men as theſe are thrown up Hill by another Man's
Arms, and made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable by Chance-Medly, their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits having been very
inconſiderable, or rather nothing at all, when other Men in the ſame Battle
perform'd much more ſignal Service than that former Perſon; yet their
Courage was never Rewarded, <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0544000400:277"/> but loſt in the Crowd and
Tumult of the Action, and got nothing but Blows for their Pains; whereas the
other are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Great, not by their Genealogy, but by good Fortune, and
having their Tongues well hung, and telling their Story handſomely, which was
their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Merit. Men that are thus preferr'd, ſhould remember that
there were others which ventur'd further, and perform'd more conſiderable
Service, which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried as to any private Advantage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were
not ſo lucky to give an Account to him that was able to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: So that we
daily ſee many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, well furniſh'd for Employments and Honour, go
out of the World, as obſcurely as they came into it, only for want of a good
Occaſion to bring them into Light: Now ſuch Men as before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, who
have receiv'd ſo valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſideration for their ſmall or no Services,
ought to acquieſce, and not preſs too much, being Gentlemen only of the
firſt Head, and ſhould therefore manage their Advancement obligingly, for
by treating People roughly, they do but expoſe themſelves, and reproach
their own former Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0544000400:278"/>Now he that is truly Noble, hath far different
Sentiments, his Greatneſs is eaſie, obliging, and agreeable, ſo that none
have juſt Cauſe to wiſh him Leſs. He is ſenſible it is the Part of
true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to be affable in his Converſe, and generous in his Temper: He
is equally remov'd from the extreams of Pride and Baſeneſs, and as
Proſperity does not make him Haughty, ſo neither does Adverſity make him
Demean himſelf, he ſcorns either to trample upon thoſe below him, or to
cringe to the greateſt Monarch.</p>
            <p>Ancient Nobility is very glorious, when 'tis found with Virtue,
which adds new Splendour to the Honour of his Houſe, and challenges Reſpect
from all; but Lewd Greatneſs is nothing but the Rigour of Vice, having both
Mind and Merits to be uncontroulably Lewd: And a debauched Son of a Noble
Family, is one of the intollerable Burthens of the Earth; and the good
Education he hath had, is an Auxiliary to his Shame, and the Brightneſs of
his Anceſtors makes his Darkneſs more notorious. To be Good and Great is an
excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; but he is more to be valued that is Good whoſe
Father expired a <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0544000400:279"/> Clown, than the vitious Son of the
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Lord, tho' his Lineal Deſcent be never ſo high; For Virtue in a
Man of obſcure Parents is like an unpoliſh'd Diamond which lies among
Pebbles, which tho' neglected by the Vulgar, yet the wiſe Lapidary takes it
up as a Jewel.</p>

Happineſs, and ſafely guards it, 'tis Contentment alone that crowns it; if
Safety be the Fort, Contentment is the Magazine. Peace without Contentment is
but Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, Safety without it is but a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but Contentment without
both is a Kingdom: If without following Peace, a Man becomes his own Enemy, if
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endeavouring Safety he be his own Traytor, without enjoying
Contentment he is his own Troubler; the Diſcontented Man hath neither
Neighbour, nor Friend, nor indeed himſelf. 'Tis not in the rich Fool's Barns,
nor in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s raviſh'd Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, nor in <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s knack
of Wit, no nor in wiſer <hi>Solomon</hi>'s dear-bought Experience; no, 'tis a
quiet Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Spirit that a Man poſſeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. A Man may
pick a Quarrel with himſelf in the midſt of all worldly Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, 
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0544000400:281"/> without this Charm of Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: The Truth is,
Diſcontent is the Bone that the Devil throws into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man's Mouth to gnaw
upon, and break his Teeth with. You ſhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find any Man, that
complains not of ſome Want, tho' it be but Want of his own Will; Things go
not right, if they run not upon the vertiginous Wheels of his own Fancy; the
poor Man thinks the World unequally dealt, and the rich Man thinks ſo too,
becauſe the Care, together with the Keys, hang ſo heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about him; the
Schollar thinks the Soldier hath all the Money, and he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that the other
hath all the Eaſe; the ſingle Man wants a Wife, and the marry'd Man wants
no leſs in that he wants not a Wife; and Men ſtrive to vexthemſelves by
their own Diſcontents, and flatter themſelves in not doing what they
ſhould do, by preſuming what they would do, were but their Condition o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than it is, not conſidering that every Eſtate hath its Weights as well as
Wings, and that the true Pleaſure of Life is to be free from Perturbation, to
enjoy the preſent (without any anxious Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the future) not to
amuſe our ſelves either with Hopes or Fears, but to reſt ſatisfied with
what we have, for <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0544000400:282"/> he that is ſo wants nothing; the
great Bleſſings of Mankind are within us, and within our reach, but we
ſhut our Eyes, and like People in the dark, we fall foul upon every thing we
ſearch for, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding it, an equality of Mind makes every Man his own
Supporter; whereas he that is born up by any thing elſe may fall; it is a
contented Mind that makes a Man Happy; there muſt be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in all
Conditions, with ſuch an indifferency for the Bounties of Fortune, that
either with them, or without them, we may live Contentedly.</p>
            <p>It is the part of a great Mind to be temperate in Proſperity, and
reſolute in Adverſity. There are ſome that will cloſe and grapple with
ill Fortune, and will come off victorious; but there are others again ſo
delicate, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as bear a ſcandalous Report; which is
the ſame thing, as if one ſhould quarrel for being juſtled in a Crowd, or
daſhed as he walks in the Streets: A brave Man muſt expect to be
toſſed, for he is to ſteer his Courſe in the Teeth of Fortune, and to
work againſt Wind and Weather.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Cauſe of Impatience grows not ſo much from the
Force of Calamity, as from the Reluctance of the <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0544000400:283"/> Mind of
him that ſuffers it; this raiſes the Billows within, for tho' the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be rough and beyond our Power to extricate; yet when it meets with a Mind
as tumultuous as the Calamity, it raiſes a Storm, as when the Wind and Tyde
are contrary, which may endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Veſſel.</p>
            <p>He that violently contends againſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, is like one
bound with ſtrong Bonds, his ſtruggling gauls him more than his Bonds would
otherwiſe do, and a proud Spirit contributes more to his own Uneaſineſs,
than his Croſs does: But Calmneſs of Mind breaks the force of the Calamity,
and the contented Man looks upon his worſt Condition to be leſs than he
deſerves, for ſo long as we live in this World, there is no Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo
troubleſome but it may be worſe: If we be Poor and under a Cloud of
Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy and Reproach, yet if we have our Health of Body and Compoſedneſs
of Mind, that's more than we deſerve; nay, if we be under a Complication of
Misfortunes, ſo long as our Lives are ſpared, there's Hope, and we muſt
be Patient under all Conditions, ſubmitting our ſelves intirely to the Will
of God; and that not only as an Act of Neceſſity and Duty, but as an Act of
Choice and <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0544000400:284"/> Prudence, ſince all the Succeſſes of
our Life are under the Government of Providence, and we may be aſſured,
that God will either in due time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them, or ſupport us under them.</p>
            <p>Temporal Afflictions are Spiritual Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, being adminiſtred
by the no leſs tender than skillful Hand of Providence; but we, like
fooliſh Patients, embitter our Condition, by chewing the Pills which we
ſhould ſwallow; we mingle our Paſſions with our Croſſes, and thro'
Impatience ſtruggle with our Yoak, thereby making our Burthen more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
and our Afflictions the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous: God's Love is fatherly for Eaſe, as
well as motherly for Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as a Father he will ſometimes hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his
Children by Afflictions, ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with his Hand, not as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſtill indulging them in Delights: He does always ſend his Staff with his
Rod, his Grace with his Affliction, to Inſtruct, Support and Comfort us
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's well ſaid, That all the Troubles and Diſtreſſes that
befal us, tho' bitter Arrows, yet they come from the ſweet Hand of God,
whoſe ſpecial Providence over us is ſuch, that he afflicts us in Mercy:
God's Patronage and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not like that of Men, who as
<hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> 
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0544000400:285"/> ſays, They offend the Miſerable by
defending them; like the thorny Buſh, to which in the Storm when the poor
Sheep run for Shelter, they loſe their Fleeces: But God is a Sun and a Shield
to thoſe in Affliction; A Sun to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them in the midſt of
Darkneſs, and a Shield to defend them in the midſt of Dangers; and by his
Spiritual Providence he then ſaves, when we ſeem to be paſt Succour; and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have reaſon, not only patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſubmit, but cheerfully
and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly to bear any Condition which he diſpenſes, and with an
implicite Faith to reſign our Wills to his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured it is
infinitely more Wiſe and Juſt than ours.</p>

               <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>Optimi milites ad duriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima
mittuntur</hi>; the ſtouteſt Soldiers are put upon the hotteſt Service;
and ſo the beſt Men upon the ſharpeſt Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. It is a mark of a
General's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, when he puts an Officer upon a Poſt of Danger, who does
not ſay his General uſes him ill, but does him Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and ſo ſhould
we ſay that are commanded to encounter Difficulties: A Maſter gives his
hopeful Schollars the hardeſt Leſſons; ſo God deals with the moſt
generous Spirits; and we are <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0544000400:286"/> not to look upon the
croſs Encounters of Fortune, as a Cruelty, but as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. God tries and
hardens us, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity of Misfortunes brings us the Contempt of them, and
that Part is ſtrongeſt which is moſt exerciſed; the Seaman's Hand is
callous, the Soldier's Arm is ſtrong, the Tree that is expoſed to the Wind
takes the beſt Root. Thoſe People that live in a perpetual Winter, in
extremity of Froſt and Want, where a Cave, a Lock of Straw, or a few Leaves,
is all their Covering, and wild Beaſts their Nouriſhment; all this by
Cuſtom is not only made tollerable, but when once 'tis taken up by
Neceſſity, by little and little it becomes Pleaſant to them. Why ſhould
we then account that Condition of Life a Calamity, which is the Lot of many
Nations? Our Life is a Warfare; and what brave Man would not rather chuſe to
be in a Tent than in a Shambles? Fortune ſeems to encounter a fearful Man,
there's no Honour in the Victory, where there's no Danger in the Way to it.</p>
            <p>She tries <hi>Mutius</hi> by Fire, <hi>Rutilius</hi> by
Baniſhment, <hi>Socrates</hi> by Priſon, <hi>Cato</hi> by Death; 'Tis only
in adverſe Fortune and bad Times, that we find great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples:
<hi>Mutius</hi> thought himſelf Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0544000400:287"/> with his Hand
in the Flame, than if it had been in the Boſom of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs: He was a
Man only of a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Courage, without the help either of Philoſophy or
Letters; who when he found he had kill'd the Secretary inſtead of
<hi>Porſenna</hi> the Prince, burnt his Right Hand to Aſhes for the
Miſtake, and held his Arm in the Flame till it was taken away by his very
Enemies. And <hi>Porſenna</hi> did more eaſily Pardon <hi>Mutius</hi> for
his intent to kill him, than <hi>Mutius</hi> forgave himſelf for miſſing
of his Aim: He might have done a Luckier Thing but never a Braver.
<hi>Metellus</hi> ſuffer'd Exile reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, <hi>Rutilius</hi> cheerfully;
<hi>Socrates</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in the Danger; and tho' he might have eſcaped,
refuſed it, to ſhew the World how eaſie a thing it was to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the
two great Terrours of Mankind, Death and Pain. The Action of <hi>Ruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
was commended by his very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who upon a glorious and publick Principle
choſe rather to loſe his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, than to return from Baniſhment; the
only Man who deny'd any thing to <hi>Sylla</hi> the Dictator, who recalled him;
but he not only refus'd to come, but retired farther off: <hi>Let them,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>who think Baniſhment a Misfortune, live Slaves at</hi> Rome,
<hi>under the imperious</hi> 
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0544000400:288"/> 
               <hi>Cruelties of</hi>
Sylla; <hi>He that ſets a Price upon the Heads of Senators, and after a Law
of his own Inſtitution againſt Cut-Throats, becomes the greateſt
himſelf.</hi> Is it not better for a Man to live abroad in Exile, than to be
maſſacred at home? 'Tis not the Torment, but the Cauſe we are to
conſider; and in ſuffering for a good Cauſe, the more Pain the more
Renown; and we muſt look upon our Baniſhment and Hardſhips as Acts of
Providence, which ſuffers Particulars many Times to be wounded, for
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the whole: Beſides, God chaſtizes ſome People under
appearance of Bleſſing them, turning their Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to their Ruin.</p>
            <p>What was <hi>Regulus</hi> the worſe becauſe Fortune made choice
of him for an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Inſtance of Patience; he was thrown into a Caſe of
Wood, ſtuck round on the inſide with pointed Nails, ſo that which way
ſoever he turned his Body it reſted upon his Wounds; his Eye-lids were cut
off to keep him waking, and yet <hi>Mecaenas</hi> was not happier upon his Bed
than <hi>Regulus</hi> upon his Torments. <hi>It hath pleaſed the Gods,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>to ſingle me out for an Experiment of the Force of humane
Nature.</hi> Indeed no Man knows his own Strength or Value but 
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0544000400:289"/> by being put to the Proof; the Pilot is try'd in a
Storm, the Soldier in a Battel: No Man can be happy that does not ſtand firm
againſt all Contingencies and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, for the more we ſtruggle with
our Neceſſities we draw the Knot the harder, the more the Bird flutters in
the Snare, the ſurer he is caught; ſo that the beſt way is to ſubmit
and lie ſtill, under this double Conſideration, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of
God are unqueſtionable, and his Decrees not to be revoked. That Man is only
Happy that is unmov'd with any external Misfortune, or at leaſt ſo little
mov'd, that the keeneſt Arrow in the Quiver of Fortune is but as the prick of
a Needle to him rather than a Wound, and all her Weapons fall upon him as Hail
upon the Roof of a Houſe, that crackles and skip off again without any Damage
to the Inhabitant.</p>
            <p>Some Philoſophers have ſearch'd ſo far for Arguments of
Comfort againſt Pain, as to doubt whether there was any ſuch thing as
Senſe of Pain; and yet when any great Evil hath befaln them, they could
ſigh, and groan, and cry out as loud as other Men. Others have held that
Afflictions are no real Evils but only in Opinion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a wiſe Man
ought not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0544000400:290"/> at them: But he muſt be a
very wiſe Man that can forbear being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at things that are
troubleſome. Others would delude this Trouble by a graver way of Reaſoning,
<hi>viz.</hi> that theſe things are fatal, and therefore we ought not to be
troubled at them, it being in vain to be troubled at what we cannot help. But
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> made a ſharp Reply to one that miniſtred this Comfort
to him, <hi>Hoc ipſum eſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>quod me male habit.</hi>
This was ſo far from giving any Eaſe to his Mind, that it was the very
thing that troubled him. But the beſt Moral Argument of Patience is, the
Advantage of Patience it ſelf: That is, to bear Evils as quietly as we can is
the way to make them lighter and eaſier; but to toſs, and fling, and to be
reſtleſs, is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to fret and inrage our Pain; 'tis like
Men in a Feaver, who infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe their Heat by their tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and
toſſing more than if they lay ſtill; and thus we gall our Sores, and make
the Burthen that is upon us ſit more uneaſie, and like the Ship that is not
broken by the Rock but by its own vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Motion againſt it; and therefore
we muſt ſo manage our ſelves under <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0544000400:291"/> Afflictions, as
not to make them more grievous than indeed they are.</p>
            <p>If we give way to our Paſſions, we do but gratifie our ſelves
for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in order to our future Diſquiet; but if we reſiſt and
conquer them, we lay the Foundation of perpetual Peace and Tranquility in our
Minds. The more we gratifie our Luſts, the more craving they will be;
<hi>Creſcit indulgens ſibi diras hydrops,</hi> every Luſt has a kind of
hydropick Diſtemper, the more we drink the more we ſhall thirſt, ſo
that by retrenching our inordinate Deſires we do not rob our ſelves of any
Pleaſures, but only the trouble of farther Diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>He that enjoys the greateſt Happineſs in this World, does
ſtill want one Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs more to ſecure him for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture what he
poſſeſſes at preſent; and if the Enjoyments of this Life were
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yet they are unſatisfying; it is a hard thing that every thing in
this World can trouble us, but nothing can give us Satisfaction. I know not how
it is, but either we or the things of this World, or both, are ſo
fantaſtical, that we can neither be well with theſe things nor without
them: If we be hungry we are in Pain, and if we be full we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie; 
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0544000400:292"/> if we are poor we think our ſelves miſerable, and if
we be rich we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly really are ſo; if we are in a low Condition we fret
and murmur, if we chance to get up and are raiſed to Greatneſs we are many
times farther from Content than before; ſo that we purſue the Happineſs
of this World juſt as little Children chaſe Birds, when we think we are
very near it, and have it almoſt in our Hands, it flies farther from us than
it was at firſt: Indeed the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this World are ſo far from
affording us Satisfaction, as the ſweeteſt of them are moſt apt to
ſatiate and cloy us: All the Pleaſures of this World are ſo contriv'd as
to yield us very little Happineſs; if they go off ſoon they ſignify
nothing, and if they ſtay long we are ſick of them: After a full Draught of
any ſenſual Pleaſure, we preſently loath it, and hate it as much after
the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as we ſearched it and longed for it in Expectation: But the
Delights of the other World, as they ſtill give us full Satisfaction, ſo we
ſhall never be weary of them, every Repetition of them will be accompanied
with a new Pleaſure and Contentment: In the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities of Heaven two things
will be reconciled, which never met together in <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0544000400:293"/> any
ſenſual Delight, long and full Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet a freſh and perpetual
Pleaſure; it would embitter the Pleaſures of Heaven to ſee an End of
them, tho' at never ſo great a Diſtance: But God hath ſo ordered things
that the vain Delights of this World ſhould be tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, but the
ſubſtantial Pleaſures of the next World be as laſting as they are
excellent.</p>
            <p>That Man is truly happy who is tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no anxious Fore-caſts
for future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, knowing nothing can happen in Contradiction of that Supreme
Will in which he hath Sanctuary, which will certainly chuſe for him with that
Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs that an indulgent Father would for his Child that caſts its
ſelf into his Arms: When our Will is thus inrolled with God's, all Calamities
are unſtring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and even thoſe things which ſeem moſt repugnant to our
ſenſitive Natures, are yet very agreeable to our Spirits. There is no Face
of Adverſity ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable which ſet in this Light will not look
amiable; let us but make ſure of Reſignation, and Content will flow into us
without our farther Induſtry. <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> ſaid rightly of
Contentment, oppoſing it to the Riches of Fortune, that 'tis the Wealth of
Nature, for it gives every thing <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0544000400:294"/> that we have learnt to
want and really need; and Reſignation in our preſent State beſtows all
things that a Chriſtian not only needs but can deſire: 'Tis the
Uſurpation of our Will over our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which breeds all the Confuſions
and Tumults within our own Hearts, and there is no poſſibility of curbing
its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence but by putting them into ſafe Cuſtody, by oommitting it to
him who alone can order our unrully Wills, and nothing but Experience can
inform us of the Serenity and Calm of that Soul who has reſigned his Will to
God.</p>
            <p>It is certain in the Courſe of the World, there muſt be a
greater number of Croſſes and Troubles than of external Comforts, nay there
is ſcarce any Comfort but, like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, it hath a Worm at the
Root of it, which not only withers the Comfort it ſelf, but creates greater
Trouble and Sorrow than the Comfort it ſelf hath if intirely enjoy'd; ſo
that in all worldly things the Stock of Troubles is three times greater than
that of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; ſo true is that of <hi>Job, A Man is born to troubles as
the Sparks fly upward</hi>; why therefore ſhould a Man ſink into
Diſcontent, becauſe the World doth but follow its own natural State?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0544000400:295"/>'Tis certain a prudent Man is like the Elixir,
it turns Iron into Gold, makes the moſt ſowr Condition of Life not only
tolerable but uſeful and convenient; for a wiſe Man will mould and frame
his worſt Condition into a Condition of Comfort by his Patience, and he that
can content himſelf with the good Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of his own Heart, has no Reaſon
to be diſcontented with his Condition, ſince if it be not good he can make
it ſuch, the Mind being the chief Matter either in Content or Diſcontent:
We need no other Proof than that of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Haman,</hi> the one a
great King the other a great Favourite to a mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch full of Wealth and
Honour, yet a covetous Mind in the one, and a proud Mind in the other, made the
former ſeek for a little Spot of Ground, and the latter grew ſo highly
diſcontented for want of the Knee of a poor <hi>Jew,</hi> that it withered
all his Enjoyments. Patience and Reſignation give us Poſſeſſion of
our ſelves, we then remain Maſters of our Paſſions, and tho' there be
Storms, and Tempeſts, and rolling Seas without us, yet all is calm within;
and tho' I want ſomething that others have, yet I have ſomewhat that many
better than I want: If I want Wealth yet I have Health, if 
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0544000400:296"/> I want Health, yet I have Children, which others want.
Thus we ſhould learn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, by conſidering others Wants and our
Enjoyments, and not learn Diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts from others Enjoyments; tho' theſe
are only moral Conſiderations, yet they are of much Uſe and Moment, and
car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd the Heathens a great way in the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Patience. But we are
furniſh'd with a more excellent way, becauſe no Affliction befalls us but
is reached out to us from the Hand of Divine Providence, from whom we have our
Being: The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral State of Mankind in this World is a State of Trouble and
Affliction, and is ſo incident to all Degrees and Conditions of Mankind, that
no Perſon of whatſoever Age or Sex but hath a Part in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon State of
Mankind. And we find Men in all Ages, that only by the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of natural
Light, have calmed their Diſquiets, and reaſoned themſelves into
Contentment, under the greateſt and moſt terrible Preſſures; Men, who,
amidſt the acuteſt Torments, have ſtill preſerv'd a Serenity of Mind,
and have fruſtrated Contempts and Reproaches by diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and
ſurely we ſhall give a very ill Account of Chriſtianity, if we cannot do
as much with it as they did without it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0544000400:297"/>The greateſt Cauſe of Diſcontent is,
that Men have no definite Meaſure of their Deſires; 'tis not the Supply of
all their real Wants will ſerve their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urn, their Appetites are
precarious, and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Contingencies; they hunger not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are
empty, but becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are full. Many would like their own Portion well
enough, if they had not ſeen another whoſe Portion they lik'd better.
<hi>Ahab</hi> might well have ſatisfy'd himſelf with the Kingdom of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> had not <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi>'s Vineyard lay in his way:
<hi>Haman</hi> could find no Guſt in all the Senſualities of the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Court, becauſe a poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable <hi>Jew</hi> denies
his Obeiſance; and thus every one of our Paſſions keeps us upon the Rack,
till they have obtain'd their Deſigns. If we will create imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wants to
our ſelves, why do we not create an imaginary Satisfaction to them. 'Twere
the merrier Frenzy of the two, to be like the mad <hi>Athenian,</hi> who
thought all the Ships that came into the Harbour his own, than to be ſtill
tormenting our ſelves with unſatiable Deſires; For we generally find
thoſe that are fartheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from Want, are ſo from Content too; they
take no notice of the real ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Bleſſings they enjoy, and go in
queſt after ſome fugitive Satisfaction, <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0544000400:298"/> which, like
a Shadow, flies ſtill faſter in proportion to their Purſuit. A ſtrange
Folly, thus to court Vexations, and be miſerable in Chimera. We chew the Cud
upon Gall and Wormwood, and embitter our own Lives meerly by theſe imaginary
Sufferings; nor do we only fright our ſelves with Images of paſt
Calamities, but we lay romantick Scenes for Diſtreſſes, and raiſe
Alarms to our ſelves: We do nicely and critically obſerve every little
adverſe Accident of our Lives, and let a whole Current of Proſperity glide
by without our Notice; like little Children, our Fingers are never off the
ſore Place, till we have pick'd every light Scratch into an Ulcer: Whereas,
if we caſt up our Accounts juſtly, we ſhall find our Receits have
infinitely exceeded our Disburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that for the few Mites of
Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience we have pay'd to our Creator, we have receiv'd Talents of Mercies
from him; but inſtead of entertaining our ſelves with the pleaſanter
Parts of God's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations to us, we always pore upon the harſher, and
look upon our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes through all the magnifying Opticks our Fancies can
ſupply; and we are ſo full of our ſelves, that we can ſee nothing
beyond it. Every Man expects God ſhould place him where he hath a Mind to be,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0544000400:299"/> and tho' we are apt to tax it as a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in
a Prince, when he indulges any thing to a private Favourite to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Diſadvantage, yet ſo unequal are we, that we murmur at God for not doing
that which we murmur at Men for doing. We muſt conſider that other Men have
the ſame Appetites with us, and if we diſlike an inferior State, why
ſhould not we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve others do ſo too; and we muſt not think God
ſhould be more concern'd to humour us than thoſe Multitudes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who
have the ſame Deſires. Every Man would be above and ſuperior, and if no
Man were below, no Man could be above: So in Wealth, moſt Men deſire more,
but every Man does at leaſt deſire to keep what he has, how then ſhall
one Part of the World be ſupply'd, without the Diminution of the other,
unleſs there ſhould be as miraculous a Multiplication of Treaſure for
Men's Avarice, as there was of Loaves for their Hunger. It was a good Anſwer
which an Ambaſſador of an oppreſſed Province gave to <hi>Anthony, If, O
Emperor, thou wilt have double Taxes from us, thou muſt help us to double
Springs and Harveſts.</hi> And ſure God muſt be at the Trouble of a new
Creation, make a double World, if he ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige himſelf to ſatisfy
all the unreaſonable <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0544000400:300"/> Appetites of Men; the Truth is,
we have generally in us the worſer Part of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers Principles, and
tho' we can very contentedly behold Multitudes below us, yet we are impatient
to ſee any above us; and thus we create Torments to our ſelves by our own
Repinings, which only ſets us farther from our Aims.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable of the firſt two Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
who were of God's immediate Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that he ſurpriz'd them with that
Dignity when they were about a mean Imployment, the one ſeeking his Father's
Aſſes, the other keeping his Father's Sheep; and ſurely he that ſits
down with this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence, is a happier Man than he that enjoys the
greateſt Worldly Splendor, but infinitely more ſo than he who impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
covets what he cannot attain, for ſuch a Man puts himſelf upon a perpetual
Rack, keeps his Appetites up to the utmoſt Stretch, and yet hath nothing
wherewith to ſatisfy them; for either we are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the Want of
ſomething we deſire, or at the ſuffering ſomething we would avoid. And
there is no Man who ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recollects the Events of his Life, but muſt
confeſs that he hath ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd Things that would have been to
his Miſchief, if he had had them; and on the other ſide, when he has
obtain'd what he deſir'd, <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0544000400:301"/> it hath been to him a
Puniſhment, rather than a Satisfaction; whereas by our Acquieſcence under
the Ills we ſuffer, the Bitterneſs is taken off from all our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
there being nothing which ſo much purifieth us, if we do not fruſtrate
their Efficacy by our irregular Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under them.</p>
            <p>Afflictions wean us from the World; we read in the Story of the
Deluge, ſo long as the Earth was covered with Waters, the very Raven was
contented to take ſhelter in the Ark; but when all was fair and dry, even the
Dove finally forſook it; and it is much ſo with us, the worſt of Men will
commonly in Diſtreſs have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to God, when the beſt of us are apt
to forget him in the Blandiſhments of Proſperity: We ſhould not therefore
give our Hearts to any external Thing, but let all the Concerns of the World
hang looſe about us, whereby we ſhall quit them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly, whenever
they are call'd for. We muſt not look to be carried into Heaven upon Beds of
Ivory, nor from the Noiſe of Harps and Viols to be immediately wrap'd up into
the Choir of Angels: We may certainly often find that thoſe Events which we
have entertain'd with Regret, have, in the Conſequences, been very
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to us, of which I am ſtill a living <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0544000400:302"/>
Teſtimony; for all the good Fortune and Promotion, which by their late
Majeſties Grace and Favour I attain'd to, was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned only by the
Dexterity I then ſhew'd in giving ſuch good Account of Affairs abroad,
whilſt I was then in Priſon at <hi>Bruges.</hi> Nay, ſometimes the
Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Man's Relations are the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Advantage; thus the
barbarous Malice of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren was the firſt Step to his
Dominion over <hi>Egypt</hi>; and it is a common Obſervation in Families,
that the moſt diſcouraged Children uſually prove better than the
Darlings; and there is nothing more ordinary than for that which one eſteems
a great Calamity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Foundation of our future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>A low Condition is a terrible thing in Sound and Opinion, and that's
all: Some Men are baniſht and ſtript of their Eſtates, others are poor in
Plenty, which is the baſeſt ſort of Beggary, for to ſpare of what a Man
hath, not only what he may need, but what he doth need, is not only to walk
with a Man's Horſe in his Hand, but to carry the Saddle too; and of the two
it is a great deal better to die a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar than to live a Beggar. We uſually
condemn Villains to the Mines, and he that labours firſt to get Mony, and
then <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0544000400:303"/> locks up his Mony from himſelf, condemns both
himſelf and it but again to the Mines, as if he envied both their very Being
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Ground. Poverty is not a thing to be wiſht no more than War, but if it
be our Lott, we muſt bear our Misfortunes as becomes wiſe and honeſt Men;
we do not pray for War, but for Generoſity and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in all the
Extremities of War, if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. Afflictions are but the Exerciſes of
Virtue, and an honeſt Man is out of his Element when he is idle: It is a
common Argument againſt the Juſtice of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the matter of Reward
and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, the Misfortunes of good Men in this World, and the
Proſperity of the wicked; but alas, Misfortunes come by Divine Appointment,
and to thoſe that are good Men even for that very Reaſon becauſe they are
good: Proſperity ſhews a Man but one Part of humane Nature, no Body knows
what ſuch a Man's good for, neither in Truth doth he underſtand himſelf
for want of Experiment. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Happineſs is for weak and vulgar Minds, but
Calamity is the Touchſtone of a brave Mind, that reſolves to live and die
free and Maſter of it ſelf; and Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is beſt for us, for it is
God's Mercy to ſhew the World their Errors, and that the things they fear and
covet are neither <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0544000400:304"/> good nor evil, being the common and
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Lott both of good Men and bad; if they were good only the good
ſhould enjoy them, and if bad only the wicked ſhould ſuffer them: A
wiſe Man carries all his Treaſure within himſelf; and what Fortune gives
ſhe may take, but he leaves nothing at her Mercy: He ſtands firm and keeps
his Ground againſt all Misfortunes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as changing
Countenance, he is Proof againſt all Accidents: He is a Friend to Providence,
and will not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at any thing that comes to paſs by God's Appointment,
and never any Man was broken by Adverſity that was not firſt betrayed by
Proſperity. The Truth is, we are generally miſtaken in the Nature of Good
and Evil, and have not the true Meaſures of it; that is truly good which
makes a Man the better, and that truly evil which makes a Man the worſe; if
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity makes me thankful, munificent and humble, then 'tis good for me,
and makes me better, but if it makes me proud 'tis evil for me: If Adverſity
makes me cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and murmur 'tis ill for me, but if it makes me humble,
ſober and patient then 'tis good; and let every Man impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially take the
Meaſure of the very ſame Man in each Condition, he ſhall find ten to one
receive more Miſchief by Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0544000400:305"/> than
Adverſity. There is a ſtrange Witchcraft in Proſperity which gets ground
upon our Mind and Virtue, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon our Humility, for Worldly Grandeur
ſecretly ſteals away that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and impairs it ſooner than any other;
Pride is the Devil, that uſually haunts and waits upon Worldly Greatneſs:
How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men have we ſeen, that under the greateſt Preſſures and
Calamities of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Reproach have yet kept up their Reputation, but in
the warm Beams and Sun-ſhine of Proſperity have caſt off their
Goodneſs, as the Traveller did his Cloak in the Fable, and became as great
Oppreſſors and debauch'd Livers, as if they had never heard of Heaven or
Hell. True Humility is a great Guard upon the Soul of a Man againſt theſe
Rocks and Hazards; an humble Man looks upon all his Proſperity and Plenty not
as his own, but as it is the Diſpoſition of the great Maſter of the
Family of Heaven and Earth, Talents entruſted to him as a Steward to employ
for his Maſter's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Honour, and not for his own Grandeur and
Pleaſure; Our Vices are the Vermin that are commonly bred in us by the warm
Influences of Proſperity.</p>
            <p>We do not compare the Good of others with our Good, nor their Evil
with our <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0544000400:306"/> Evil, but with an envious Curioſity we
amaſs together all the deſirable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our Neighbour's
Condition, and with a prying Diſcontent we ranſack all our Grievances, and
confront to them; this is but a thin Piece of Sophiſtry; and we change the
Scene, we compare our Neighbours and our ſelves in Point of Mortality, where
we make his Vices as much exceed ours, as our Calamities did his in the other
Inſtance. However this is the pleaſanter kind of Deceit, for a Man hath
ſome Joy in thinking himſelf leſs wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than his Neighbour, but no
Comfort in thinking himſelf more miſerable. Indeed if we could uſe our
Eyes aright, and ſee Things in their true Shapes, a Competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would be more
pleaſing than Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and the envy'd Pomp of Princes, when ballanc'd with
the Cares and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards annex'd, would rather make a wiſe Man fear than
deſire Preferment; and if a Man well underſtood the Right, he would rather
chuſe to wield a Flail than a Scepter; and indeed there is no greater
Unhappineſs than the fond Admiration of other Mens Enjoyments, and Contempt
of our own: But if we would begin at the right end, and look with as much
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the Adverſities of others, as we do with Envy at their
Proſperities, <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0544000400:307"/> every Man would find Cauſe to ſit
down contentedly with his own Burthen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David,</hi> the Man after God's own Heart, was no leſs
ſignal for his Afflictions than for his Piety; he was ſometime an Exile
from his Country, and after being ſettled in his Throne, what a
Succeſſion of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities had he in his own Family; the inceſtuous Rape
of his Daughter, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation of that by the Murder of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and
that ſeconded by the rebellious and barbarous Conſpiracy of
<hi>Abſalon</hi>; his Expulſion from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; the baſe
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings of <hi>Shimei</hi>; and laſtly, the Loſs of his darling Son in
the Act of his Sin. It is an ill-natur'd thing for any Man to think himſelf
more miſerable, becauſe another is happy, and yet it is this thing alone,
by which many Men have made themſelves wretched, having created Wants to
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, from the envious Contemplation of other Mens Abundance. Whenever
God adminiſters to us a bitter Cup, we may be ſure the Ingredients are
medicinal, and ſuch as our Infirmities require; he durſt not truſt our
intemperate Appetites with unmix'd Proſperities, the Laſcivouſneſs
whereof, tho' it may pleaſe our Palates, yet it may engender moſt fatal
Diſeaſes. But alas, we do not underſtand our own Intereſt, becauſe we
do not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0544000400:308"/> what we are our ſelves.
We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our ſelves meerly in our animal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our Bodies, and when
we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded there, we think we are undone, tho' that Breach be made only to
retrieve that diviner Part within us, oppreſs'd with the Fleſh about it,
for our Body is to our Soul but as a Garment to the Body, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe
and Cover; and certainly he muſt be a mad Man that would not rather have his
Cloaths cut than his Fleſh, and we ought not to repine that our Souls are
cured at the Coſt of our Bodies; and our impatient Reſiſtances do only
fruſtrate the medicinal Part of our Afflictions, and our Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may ruin
our Souls but will never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert any of our outward Calamities.</p>
            <p>To make a right Eſtimate of this World, we ſhould conſider it
as a Stage, and our ſelves but as Actors, and to reſolve that it is very
little material what Part we play, ſo we do it well; a Comedian may get as
much Applauſe by acting the Slave as the Conqueror, and he that acts the one
to Day, may to Morrow reverſe the Part and perſonate the other; and
certainly he that hath well impreſt upon his Mind the Vanity and Vexation of
the World, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be much ſurpriſed at any thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls him in it.
We take the magnifying Glaſſes of Diſcontent when we view our 
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0544000400:309"/> own Miſeries and others Felicities, but look upon our
Enjoyments and their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings thro' the contracting Opticks of Ingratitude
and Incompaſſion. It is a very ill-natured thing for any Man to think
himſelf more miſerable becauſe another is happy, and yet this is the very
thing by which alone many Men have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wretched, creating Wants
to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves meerly from the envious Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of other Mens
Abundance. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> was happy enough in his original State, yet could
not think himſelf ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not like the moſt High, and by
inſolent Ambition forfeited his Bliſs; and thoſe do perfectly
tranſcribe his Copy, who cannot be ſatisfied with any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Degree of
Proſperity but what their Impatiencies with other Mens Enjoyments of what
they cannot attain. God never articled with the Ambitious to give him Honours,
with the Covetous to fill his Bags, with the Voluptuous to feed his Luxury; if
therefore we expect to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied let us modeſtly confine our Deſires
within the Limits God hath ſet us, and then every Acceſſion which he
ſuperadds will appear a Bounty.</p>
            <p>The beſt Expedient for Contentment is to confine our Thoughts to
the preſent. We often heap fantaſtick Loads upon our <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0544000400:310"/>
ſelves by anxious Preſages of things which perhaps will never happen, which
is one of the greateſt Follies imaginable; for either the Evil will come, or
it will not; if it will, 'tis ſure no ſuch deſirable Gueſt that we
ſhould go on to meet it, we ſhall feel it time enough when it comes, we
need not anticipate our Senſe of it; but if it will not come, what extream
Madneſs is it for a Man to torment himſelf with that which will never be,
to create to himſelf Engines of Tortures, and by ſuch chimerical
Afflictions make himſelf as miſerable as the moſt real ones could do?
therefore let us reſt our ſelves upon that admirable Aphoriſm of our
Saviour's, <hi>ſufficient unto the Day is the Evil thereof.</hi> A querilous
repining Humour is one of the moſt pernicious Habits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Mankind,
but yet as deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed People are moſt often in Love with themſelves, ſo
this crooked Piece of our Temper is of all others the moſt indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to it
ſelf; it will nouriſh it ſelf with Chimeras, ſuborn a thouſand
ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Diſtreſſes, and is impatient of any Diverſion, loves to
converſe only with it ſelf: Men cheriſh this Diſeaſe of their Mind,
and improve their Torment, roll and chew the bitter Pill in their Mouths, and
by devoting all Thoughts to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <pb n="272" facs="tcp:0544000400:311"/> of their Grief,
keep up an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Senſe of it, as if they had the ſame Tyranny for
themſelves which <hi>Caligula</hi> had for others, and lov'd to feel
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves die. This Word Calamity hath an ill Reputation in the World, the
very Name is more grievous than the thing it ſelf; what need any Man complain
if he can turn that into a Happineſs which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers count a Miſery? a wiſe
Man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſurpriſed, in the midſt of Plenty he prepares for Poverty,
as a prudent Prince does for War in the Depth of Peace; our Condition is good
enough if we make the beſt on't, and our Felicity is in our own Power. Every
Man ſhould ſtand upon his Guard againſt Fortune, and take heed to
himſelf when ſhe ſpeaks him faireſt. A brave Man looks upon himſelf
as a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, a Soldier of the World, in deſpite of Accidents and
Oppoſitions he maintains his Station, and is more ambitious of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reputed
Good than Happy. <hi>Mutius</hi> loſt his Right Hand with more Honour than he
could have preſerved it; he was a greater Conqueror without it than he could
have been with it, for with the very Stump of it he overcame two Kings,
<hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> and <hi>Porſenna. Rutilia</hi> follow'd <hi>Cotta</hi> into
Baniſhment, ſhe ſtaid and ſhe return'd with him too, and ſoon after
ſhe loſt him <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0544000400:312"/> without ſo much as ſhedding a Tear;
a great Inſtance of her Courage in his Baniſhment, and of her Prudence in
his Death.</p>
            <p>Many Men have longer Intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Afflictions than
others, yet none are totally exempt from them; and that Man who hath lived to
the ordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Age of Man, will find his Croſſes and
Sufferings have out-weighed the treaſure of his Comforts in this Life: The
poor Man reckons it his Affliction that he wants Wealth, and the rich Man is
not without his Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either in the Loſs of it, or for fear of
loſing it.</p>
            <p>Men in Proſperity cannot ſuppoſe a Change in their Eſtates;
a healthful Man can hardly think of dying; the Reaſon is, that our preſent
Condition falls under our preſent Senſe, and takes up our whole
Conſideration, and things that are not yet are only preſent by
Contemplation, which does not ſo ſtrongly affect the Mind, becauſe it
hath not the like Strength of Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the Mind as that which is
preſent and ſenſible; whereas an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of a diſadvantageous
Change of our Condition, admirably fills a Man with ſuch a Temper of Spirit
as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0544000400:313"/> his changed Condition: But a Man in
Proſpetity, that never puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the ſad Thoughts of a Change
of his preſent Happineſs, if ſuch a Change befalls him he is at his Wits
end, he is ſurpriſed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with it, being taken before he is
prepar'd: It is certain it is a very great Improvidence for a Man to be
learning thoſe Virtues, when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Neceſſity calls for the Uſe
of them; it's like a Thief who is to learn to read when he is to pray his
Clergy.</p>
            <p>Affliction doth not ſo much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a good Man to loſe his
Innocence as Wealth and Honour do; let any Man obſerve either in himſelf or
others, we are all equally the worſe for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and it is a far

ſaid, <hi>Lord when I was in Proſperity I heard thee, but now in my

that ſhe muſt ſmart in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be made ſenſible. We are not
to be wrought upon but when afflicted and in Miſery: <hi>Jonas</hi> in the
Whale's Belly, the Prodigal in the Pig-ſty, the Sick in hi Feaver, the
Laſcivious in his Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-tub, then they recollect themſelves; but when
in Sports and Paſtimes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in a Sea of Plenty and Delights, all our
Senſes are ſhut up, and no Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage open: Solid Virtue, like a Roſe
amidſt Thorns, ſeldom ſprings forth but in the Soil of Croſſes,
Afflictions and Auſterities. Thoſe Men are truly virtuous who take as it
were with the ſame Reliſh the Gall of Misfortunes and the Honey of
Proſperity: No ſtormy Seaſons hinder their Journey, and that which
diſtracts the ſoft and effeminate is to them Matter of Repoſe and Joy;
all Things that paſs under the Name of Adverſity are not ſo but to the
wicked, who make ill uſe of them in priſing the Creature more than the
Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. The Delay our bleſſed Saviour made in ſending Succour to his
Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, endanger'd by a Storm at Sea, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently hints unto us the
Pleaſure God takes to ſee the Juſt row againſt the Stream, tug and
wreſtle with all the <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0544000400:316"/> Force they can againſt the
Storms and Afflictions of this World: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is well obſerved,
that God laid open <hi>Job</hi> to all the Aſſaults of Satan, but with this
Reſerve, that he touch'd not his Life, and this not in regard that Death
would have eclipſed the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that great Champion, but becauſe he would
not be depriv'd of ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant, to whoſe Conflict God with his
bleſſed Angels were intent with much Satisfaction, and ſo would not
loſe the Pleaſure of ſeeing that ſtout Skirmiſh fought to the laſt,
betwixt him and his Enemy; and ſomething to this Purpoſe St. <hi>Gregory
Nyſſen</hi> declares upon God's proceeding with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to ſet up a brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, at the Sight of which
thoſe who ſhould be bitten by thoſe venomous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might immediately
find their Cure; and asking the Reaſon why God did not take a ſhorter
Courſe by deſtroying all thoſe Serpents, which had given an end to the
Plague; he at laſt ſatisfies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with this Reaſon, that whilſt
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> beheld the ſovereign Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in caſting up their
Eyes to Heaven, they might thereby have Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to conſider from whence
they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Deliverance, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0544000400:317"/>
that groſs ungrateful People would ſoon have forgot; ſo that to draw them
to pay what they ow'd to his Goodneſs, he was feign to lengthen out their
Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
            <p>Some Men are tired with whatever they have enjoyed in this World,
and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no greater Satisfaction ſhould they live a thouſand Years;
every Pleaſure appears but the ſame in different Forms, and they all agree
in leaving us afflicted with the ſame or greater Pain they found us in. We
walk here on Earth in an inchanted Caſtle of Shadows and Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries, our
whole Life is full of Vanity and Miſtake; every Man's Fortune is but a
Repetition of <hi>Ixion</hi>'s, we court Clouds inſtead of Divinities, and
our moſt charming Fruitions conſiſt in Emptineſs.</p>
            <p>Reſignation and Tranquility are the golden Mean, and he that
ſteps over this Line on one ſide or the other, falls into the ſame Vanity
which he bemoans or ridicules in the reſt of Mortals. I have peruſed many
Books, and convers'd with more Men, yet none of them can inform me what I am my
ſelf; for in this Life we are faign to peep into the World thro' the cloſe
Windows of our Senſes, which are ſo darkned with the <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0544000400:318"/>
Duſt our Paſſions raiſe, beſides the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Dulneſs of our

during this mortal Life.</p>
            <p>Many great Princes have exchanged the toilſome Glory and royal
Fatigues of Empire for the ſweet Tranquility and Eaſe of a Country Farm,
and the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Exerciſes of Agriculture: Thus <hi>Diocleſian</hi>
quitted his Throne for the ſake of a private Life, and thoſe Hands which
had been accuſtomed to weild a Scepter, became at laſt volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
familiar with the Spade, the Plough, and the Harrow. So Grand <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> uſed to boaſt of the Gardens planted

the <hi>Fabii,</hi> the <hi>Lentuli,</hi> the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceros,</hi> and

            <p>We are all ſubject to various Changes and Viciſſitudes in this
mortal State; our Lives are alternatively chequered with Good and Evil; Virtue
and Vice have their Turns in the Series of moſt Mens Actions, Proſperity
and Adverſity in the Courſe of our Lives, and no Man can with Truth boaſt
the contrary, for we are all born to be Adventurers which happen in the

            <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs to the Life the Pleaſure that a
Man feels in Solitude, when free and undiſturbed he can for many Hours behold
the Motions of the Moon and Stars, which raiſe pious Thoughts and
Contemplations within his Breaſt; his raviſht Soul is ready to break
Priſon with Joy, when 'tis inſpir'd with certain Demonſtrations of
Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, after which a Man is nauſeated with the narrow Principles of
ignorant Men, and hates to profane his Reaſon with the vain Diſcourſe of
ſelf-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0544000400:320"/> Fools and Ideots, a Man is then cloy'd

            <p>The Caſt of an Eye many times diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the ſecret Sentiments
of the Heart, ſo does a ſhrug of the Shoulders, a pout of the Lip, or any
other artificial Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; they are all ſignificant and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of
what Affections and Thoughts we harbour within. There are ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Characters in every Man's Face which ſpeak the Nature of the Perſon; we
read the hidden Qualities of Men at the firſt Daſh; ſome Men have the
very Signature of Virtue in their Faces, and hence are laſting Friendſhips
often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
            <p>I have ſpent the Spring and Summer of my Life in Vanity, Error,
and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, 'tis time I ſhould provide for the Winter of my Age a ſtock
of ſolid Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Virtue.</p>
            <p>It is as natural for the vulgar to inveigh againſt generous Souls,
as 'tis for Dogs to bark at the Moon, and yet that Planet is not moved at the
Snarles of inviduous Animals; ſo Souls truly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contemn the Cenſures of
the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Part of Men.</p>
            <p>God is pleas'd ſo to diſpenſe his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſſings,
that he which hath leaſt <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0544000400:321"/> hath enough, not only to
oblige his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence but his Thankfulneſs; tho' every Man hath not all
he wiſhes, yet he hath that which is more valuable than that he complains to
want. We muſt keep our Deſires at home, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to ramble at
things without our Reach: God hath placed none of us in ſo barren a Soil, in
ſo forlorn a State, but there is ſomething perhaps in it which may afford
us Comfort. But if in a ſullen Humour we will not cultivate our own Field,
becauſe we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more mind to our Neighbour's, we may thank our
ſelves if we ſtarve; the deſpiſing of what God hath given us is but a
cold Invitation to farther Bounty, this complaining Humour is a Sickneſs of
the Mind, a perpetual Craving of the Appetite without any Poſſibility of
Satisfaction, and is the ſame in the Heart which the <hi>Caninus
apetitus</hi> is in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach: The Generality of Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonly
made unhappy, not by any thing without them, but by thoſe reſtleſs
Impatiences that are within them. And if <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Lott of God's
own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, that People whom he had ſingled out from all the Nations of
the World, could forfeit God's Favour by their Unthankfulneſs, ſure none of
us <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0544000400:322"/> can ſuppoſe we have any ſurer Entail to it. As
God loves a cheerful Giver, ſo he loves a cheerful Receiver; and we ſhould
ſoon leave off murmuring if we did but ſeriouſly conſider, that God
owes us nothing, and that whatever we receive is an Alms and not a Tribute.
<hi>Diogenes</hi> being asked what Wine drank the moſt pleaſant,
anſwered, <hi>that which is drunk at another's Coſt</hi>; and we can never
miſs of this Circumſtance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend our good Things to us, for be they
little or much they come <hi>gratis.</hi> It is the Character of an ill Nature
to write Injuries in Marble, and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits in Duſt; and however ſome may
acquit themſelves of this Imputation as to Men, yet none can do ſo in
Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God; and tho' he neither will nor can do Injury, yet we receive
every croſs Accident with great Reſentment, whilſt his real Benefits are
not at all obſerved. 'Tis true, ſome Men's Impatiences have riſen ſo
high, as to caſt away Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not cloathed with all the
Circumſtances they wiſhed; and tho' in an angry Fit many Men have with
<hi>Jonas</hi> wiſhed to die, yet ten to one ſhould Death then come, they
would be as willing to reſiſt it as was the Man in the <hi>Apologue,</hi>
who wearied with his <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0544000400:323"/> Burthen of Sticks flung it down and
call'd for Death, but when he came found no other Occaſion for him but to be
helpt up again with his Bundle. 'Tis certain our Repinings proceed not from any
Defect of God's Bounty, but from the malignant Temper within us; and as it is
an eaſier thing to ſatisfie the Cravings of a hungry Appetite, than to cure
the nauſeous Recoilings of a ſurfeited Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, ſo certainly the
Diſcontents of the poor are more eaſier allay'd than thoſe of the rich;
the Indigence of the one hath contracted his Deſires into a narrow Compaſs,
but the other, who hath his Deſires ſtretched and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is capable of
no Satisfaction: Alas! our Body, with all its Enjoyments, is but the loweſt
Inſtance of God's Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; 'tis but a decent Caſe for that ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable
Jewel within it; the Soul, like the Ark, is the thing for which this whole
Tabernacle was fram'd. The more intellectual Powers wherewith it is indued have
exerciſed the Curioſity and rais'd the Admiration of the great
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templators of Nature in all Ages; and tho' the ſimpleſt Man knows he
has the Faculties of Imagination, Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Memory and Reflection, yet
the learnedſt cannot affirm where they are <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0544000400:324"/> ſeated,
or by what Means they operate. And conſidering whereof we are made, our
Preſervation is no leſs a Work of Omnipotence than our firſt framing; nay
perhaps 'tis rather a greater, for we have now the Principles of Decay within
us, which tend to Diſſolution; we want the Supplies of ſeveral things
without us, the Failing whereof returns us again to our Duſt. The Air which
refreſhes us may at another time ſtarve us, the Meat that nouriſhes us
may choak us; nay, there is no Creature ſo inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able which does not
at ſome times ſerve us, and which may not at any time (if God permit) ruin
us; and if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence did not draw out the better Properties of
theſe Creatures for our Uſe, and reſtrain the worſer for our Security,
we ſhould quickly return to our Duſt. And if the ebbing and flowing of the
Sea put the Philoſopher into ſuch an Extaſie, that he flung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into it, becauſe he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Cauſe of it; in what
perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Raptures of Admiration may we be, who have every Minute within us
and about us more and greater Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in our Favour, when we deſerve the
Divine Power ſhould rather exert it ſelf in our Deſtruction.

more worthy of Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Solon</hi> ſeeing his Friend much

               <hi>as if they were only yours:</hi> It was the ſaying of <hi>Socrates, That

wholſome Counſels, and we reap this Fruit by adverſe Fortune, that it
brings us at laſt to Wiſdom; whereas proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fortune, like a ſtrong

Women; as we are Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to our ſelves, ſo that Sex is in a much higher
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree Myſterious; for Women have Ways by themſelves unknown to Men, their
Windings and Turnings are as intricate as thoſe of Serpents; and if
<hi>Daedalus</hi> were now alive, (tho' once the Glory of Labyrinth-makers) he
would be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to trace Women in all their ſecret, wild, unknown
Maeanders; and yet it is clear, that Womens Inclinations are not only
oftentimes better, but their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions greater than Mens; and it is
obſerv'd, that as they are generally more virtuous than Men, ſo when they
deviate to Vice, they are more hardned in it.</p>
            <p>The great Actions in which they have born a part, ſpeak the
Excellencies of their Nature: <hi>Judith</hi> in Sacred Writ is remembred with
great Glory; and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, by her
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, hath raiſed her ſelf an eternal <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0544000400:328"/>

being given in Hoſtage to King <hi>Porſenna</hi> at the Siege of
<hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe eſcaped her Guards by Night, and mounting a Horſe
ſhe found in the way, ſhe ſwam over the <hi>Tyber</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>And tho' ſome out of Wantonneſs of Wit, and Extravagancy of

Abilities beſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Matters of Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are in
neither of theſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Examples of able Women. The laſt Age gave us ſo

               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0544000400:329"/>The World indeed (which is no juſt Judge)
will ſcarce allow Women to be Wiſe; and becauſe they are generally
commended enough for other Qualities, the World therefore delights to
leſſen on one Side, what it is forced to allow on the other: For we
uſually find in Women a Delicacy of Wit not common to Men, neither are Men's
Actions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attended with ſo much Graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as Womens; and Ladies
are more skilful than Men in what they do, whether it be the Advantage of
pleaſing be more Natural to them, or that finding their great Strength to lie
there, they make it more their Study from their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: And where Women
have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to as good Education as Men, their Sex hath not
prejudiced them from being great Examples to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and this Sex hath always
been eſteem'd and found by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Empire, and when
it hath been enthron'd, it hath beſtow'd great Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city upon the Nation,
neither hath it given Place to the other Sex for illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Qualities, and
the higheſt Virtues.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Venetian</hi> Story we find certain Matrons of that City
were ſent in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as Ambaſſadreſſes to an Emperor, with whom that
State had occaſion to <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0544000400:330"/> treat; And in the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts of the World, it's uſual for Women to be
Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadreſſes; and in Affairs of Religion, Women have ever had a
great Hand, tho' ſometimes on the Left as well as the Right; ſometimes
their abundant Wealth, ſometimes their Perſonal Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to Church-men,
and ſometimes their indiſcreet Zeal; many times the Voices of great Men,
both in Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies, have been in the Power and
Diſpoſition of Women: And hence it is, that in the old Epiſtles of ſome
Popes, we find as many Letters of thoſe Popes, to the Emperors Wives,
Mothers, and Siſters, as to the Emperors themſelves.</p>
            <p>It would be a kind of unpardonable Envy to conceal ſome other

<hi>Eve,</hi> draw Arguments to prove the Dignity and Perfection of the Female
Sex, in that <hi>Adam</hi> ſignifies Earth, but <hi>Eve</hi> expreſſes
Life. And they affirm, That every Name which God impos'd on any thing,
deſcribes its Nature and Quality, as a Picture repreſents the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal;
and therefore by how much Life is to be eſteemed more than Earth, by 
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0544000400:331"/> ſo much more excellent, in the Opinion of theſe
<hi>Rabins,</hi> is Woman, than Man: They endeavour to ſtrengthen this
Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, by ſhewing, that God having made Man, and then ſurvey'd the
Syſtem of his Works, found nothing more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and divinely fram'd than
Woman, and therefore in her reſted and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Sabbath, as if he could
not make the Idea of another Creature more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than her, or as if he did
not eſteem the Univerſe it ſelf compleat, without the laſt and moſt
accompliſh'd of his Works: And as the End is always firſt in the Intention,
and laſt in Execution, Woman therefore being the laſt Work of the Creation,
it is thereby evident that ſhe was the chief Deſign and Aim God Almighty
had in building this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Fabrick, which he furniſh'd and adorn'd with
infinite Riches and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and then introduced <hi>Eve</hi> as into her
Native proper Place, there to reign as abſolute Queen over all his Works: And
beſides, the particular Place of her Creation does much exalt her, in that
ſhe was formed in Paradice amongſt the Angels, whereas <hi>Adam</hi> was
made in the common Waſte amongſt the Brutes: But the moſt prevailing
Argument is from the ſtupendious Beauty of that Sex, <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0544000400:332"/>
which like finer ſorts of Clouds in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſeem to ingroſs the Splendor
of the Sun, and to reflect his Beams on the World? How matchleſs is indeed a
Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Form? What dazzling Majeſty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons her from Hand to Foot? Can you
gaze on her lovely Countenance without Aſtoniſhment, or fix your Eyes upon
her without an Extaſie? Indeed, ſo admirable is the Figure, Voice, and Mein
of a beautiful Woman, that he is wilfully Blind, who does not ſee, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Beauties the whole World is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, are concentred in that Sex. Yet after
all this, they have their dark Side too, like the reſt of mixed Beings: They
are the Frontier Paſſes of the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and of that below, the Gates of
Life and Death, the very Avenues to Heaven or Hell, according as they are
uſed; like Fire they will warm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh a Man, if he keeps at a due
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but if he approach too near, they ſcorch and bliſter him; or
like the other Element of Water, they are very good and ſerviceable, whilſt
kept within their Bounds, but let them once break down the Banks of Modeſty,
they'll threaten all with Ruin: In a word, It is neither ſafe to Vex them in
the leaſt, or Humour them too much; the exceſs <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0544000400:333"/> of
Fondneſs, as well as the defect of natural Love, may equally undo us; Prudent
Generoſity is the only Method of making our ſelves happy in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of them. The frequent and familiar Converſe Women are allow'd with Men,
within the Bounds of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
is a great Advantage to them; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the <hi>Italians</hi> and
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> in their ſo great ſtrictneſs to this Sex, do much
Err; for beſides the Injuſtice they act, in depriving them of that Liberty
which God and Nature allows them, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould ever
become more Virtuous by being confin'd to the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly of a Cloiſter,
which muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily indulge and miniſter looſe Thoughts, when if
they converſt in the World, they might improve themſelves by Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and the Diverſions they would receive from the Company of others, which would
keep them from thinking of Ill ſo frequently.</p>
            <p>The preſent <hi>Jews</hi> of this Age, and <hi>Turks,</hi> have an
odd Opinion of Women, believing they are of an inferior Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Man, and
therefore they exclude them, the firſt from their Synagogues, the other from
their Moſques, which is not only Partial but Profane; for the 
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0544000400:334"/> Image of the Creator ſhines as clearly, if not more,
in the one, as in the other; and I believe there are as many Female Angels in
Heaven as Males, though in Heaven there be many Manſions; to which may be
added, that there went better and more refined Atoms to the Creation of Woman
than there did of Man.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, it was a weak Part in <hi>Eve</hi> to yield to the
Seducements of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but it was a weaker Thing in <hi>Adam</hi> to be
tempted by <hi>Eve</hi> who was the weaker Veſſel. The Ancient
Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers had a better Opinion of that Sex, they aſcribed all Sciences
to the Muſes, all Sweetneſs and Morality to the Graces, and Prophetick
Inſpirations to the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylls; and we find in all Authors high Examples of the
Virtues of Women; And if they did but conſider what an Aſcendant they have
upon Men, and that tho' they were the Source of all our Miſeries, yet we
ſtill adore them, they would be ſomething more complacent; for it is
certainly a ſign of good Nature to be amorous of Women; and he is look'd upon
as a Monſter, or degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Perſon, who feels no Warmths of Paſſions
for that lovely Sex: Women were ſent into the World on purpoſe, 
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0544000400:335"/> as many think, to blow up thoſe gentle Flames, which
ſublimate our groſſer Mould, and make us more refined: The Love of Women
is riveted in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and our Blood muſt firſt grow Cold before this
Flame can be extinguiſhed; nay many times it is more fervent, tho' of a
ſhort Duration, in our lateſt Hours than in our Prime: As when the Oil
which feeds a Lamp is almoſt ſpent, the ſtartled Flame begins to rouze it
ſelf and burn afreſh, as if it would feign ſubſiſt a little longer,
and then it crackles and flaſhes with greater Noiſe and Luſtre than
before, but preſently expires; ſo does this Amorous Fire, when we are
neareſt our Diſſolution, begin to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us moſt, and makes our Souls
blaze with Fevers of Deſire and Grief, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Period is near. I know
ſome Women are as Shadows, the more you follow them the faſter they fly
from you; and they are of that odd Humour, that to feed their Pride, they will
ſtarve thoſe Natural Paſſions which are owing from them to Men: I
confeſs, Coyneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſome Beauties, if handſomely acted, and a
Frown from ſome Faces penetrates more, than the ſoft Glances of a mincing
Smile; but if this Coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or thoſe Frowns ſavour of Pride, 
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0544000400:336"/> they are odious, if not ridiculous; for it is a true
Rule, where this kind of Pride inhabits, Honour ſits not long Porter at the
Gate.</p>
            <p>There are indeed ſome Beauties ſo ſtrong, that no Batteries
can do any good upon them; there are others that are tenable a good while, but
will incline to Parley at laſt, and that Fort which begins to Parley is half
won: For my own Part, I think of Women what <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> of
<hi>Macedon</hi> thought of Cities, There is none ſo Inexpugnable but an
Aſs laden with Gold may enter into it; and as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſay,
Preſents may rend Rocks; Pearls and golden Bullets may do much upon the
moſt impregnable Beauty that is. And yet I knew an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lord
that ſent a little Dog to a Lady he eſteem'd much, with a rich Collar of
Diamonds; ſhe took the Dog, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd the Collar; but what effect it
wrought after I cannot ſay. 'Tis a powerful Sex; they were too ſtrong for
the firſt, the ſtrongeſt, and the wiſeſt Man that ever was; and yet
for all their Strength, in Point of Value, the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſays, (I
will not ſay truly) That a Man of Straw is worth a Woman of Gold. In fine,
the beſt Advice I can give in this Caſe, is, When Women are 
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0544000400:337"/> perverſe, retire handſomely, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much
Honour to be got in a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Retreat, as in a hot Purſuit; and by this
Retreat you will get a greater Victory than you think of, for you will Overcome
your ſelf, which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Conqueſt that can be made.</p>
            <p>Thoſe do great wrong to Ladies that eſteem them unable to govern
a State, ſince Hiſtory tells us, That the Female Sex is not only worthy to
bear the Scepter, but that Ladies have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and enlarged the Kingdoms
of <hi>Spain, England, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who never
flouriſhed ſo much as under the two <hi>Elizabeths, Margaret</hi> and
<hi>Chriſtina:</hi> Never King of <hi>England</hi> was better obey'd than
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; the Commanders freely acknowledg'd their Victories
proceeded as much from the happy Genius of their Queen as from their own
Valour: And <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Wife to <hi>Philip</hi> IV.
would have re-eſtabliſhed the Affairs of <hi>Spain,</hi> if the
Impertinency of a Favourite had not held her at a diſtance from the Councils
of the King her Husband: They are not all ſufficiently qualified to Rule,
neither are Men. There are but few Women indeed, becauſe the Malice or Envy
of Men keeps them off from <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0544000400:338"/> ſhewing their Abilities,
and making their Prudence and Generoſity admired; and if there were as many
Women as Princes upon the Throne, we ſhould often find Female
Accompliſhments ſuperior to ours, there being many Ladies worthy to Govern,
and would be many more, if they were inſtructed and brought up to great
Affairs from their younger Years.</p>

Him, who can make him happy or miſerable for ever. Tho' a Man could know all

ſound the Depths of all Arts and Sciences, could diſcover the Intereſts
of all States, the Intrigues of all Courts, the Reaſons of all civil Laws and

ſhould want the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: All this would be but an impertinent
Vanity, and a glittering kind of Ignorance. Such a Man would be undone with all

into the Ditch. For true <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0544000400:340"/> Wiſdom regards our own

Concerns.</p>
            <p>Nothing can more effectually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Foundation of our
Happineſs, than to baniſh the Belief of a God out of the World; for if
there were no God, Man would be in a worſe Condition than Beaſts, who are
only ſenſible of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pain, and when it is upon them they bear it as
they can, not being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of Evils at a Diſtance, nor tormented
with the Proſpect of what may befal them hereafter; but Man is liable to
theſe Evils and many others, which are ſo much the greater, becauſe they
are aggravated by the ſharp Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of our own Thoughts, and if there be
no God we are wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Comfort, and without any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy than what

the Apprehenſion of Evils at a Diſtance, for in that Caſe we are
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that either God by his Providence will prevent the Evils we fear, or
will ſupport us under them when they come, or will make them the Occaſion
of a greater good to us, by turning them <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0544000400:341"/> either to our

            <p>Atheiſm hath ſtruck on a ſudden into ſuch a Reputation, that
it ſcorns any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſculk, but ſhews it ſelf more Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly than
moſt Men dare do the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; nothing paſſes for Wit that hath not its

every dull Man that can but ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſdain his Maker, hath by it
ſecured his Title to Ingenuity: And yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any Man who
ſees only the ſmalleſt part of the Univerſe, to doubt of a Free and
Supream Being, untill by the Senſe of his Wickedneſs it becomes his
Intereſt there ſhould be none; for certainly there never was any Man who
ſaid there was no God, but he wiſhed it firſt.</p>
            <p>'Twas good Counſel given to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> to be very

their Joy at his Death, leaſt they might find him alive to revenge their

they preſume thus to defie him, leaſt they find him at laſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
his Being in their Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0544000400:342"/>The great Myſtery of Atheiſm, is, that Men
are wedded to their Luſts, and are reſolved upon a wicked Courſe, and
ſo it becomes their Intereſt to wiſh there were no God, and to believe
ſo if they can; ſo that nothing but the Power of vicious Inclinations
ſways Mens Minds towards Atheiſm, and when Mens Judgments are once
byaſs'd, they do not believe according to the Evidence of Things, but
according to their Humour and Intereſt; for when Men live as if there were no
God, it becomes expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for them that there ſhould be none, and then they
endeavour to perſuade themſelves ſo, and are glad to find Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to
fortifie themſelves in that Perſuaſion.</p>
            <p>That there have been many falſe Gods deviſed, is rather an
Argument that there is a true One, than that there is none: There would be no
Counterfeits but for the ſake of ſomething that's real; For tho' all
Pretenders ſeem to be what they really are not, yet they pretend to be
ſomething that really is: There would be no Braſs Money if there were not
good and lawful Money: <hi>Briſtol</hi> Stones would not pretend to be
Diamonds, if there never had been any Diamonds: Thoſe two great Counterfeits,

            <p>It is evident to common Senſe, that Man is not ſufficient of
himſelf to his own Happineſs; he is liable to many Miſeries, which he can
neither prevent nor redreſs: He is full of Wants which he cannot ſupply,
and of Infirmities which he cannot remove, and obnoxious to Dangers againſt
which he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide: Conſider a Man without God's Protection, and he is
ſure of nothing he enjoys, and uncertain of every thing he hopes for. He
Grieves for what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help, Deſires what he cannot obtain; Courts
Happineſs, which flies from him the farther he purſues it. His Hopes and
Expectations are bigger than his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, his Fears and Jealouſies more
troubleſome than the Evils themſelves: So that the Atheiſt deprives
himſelf of all Comfort that the Apprehenſions of a God can give a Man, and
yet is liable to all the Trouble and Diſguſt of thoſe

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST People take up their Religion for a Faſhion, and receive it
according to the Country where they are born, and are therefore of that
Religion; and the Reaſon why we are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> rather than
<hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> is becauſe Chriſtian Religion
had the Fortune to come firſt in our Way, and beſpeak us at our Entrance
into the World. The Chriſtian Religion may make <hi>Archymedes</hi>'s
Challenge, Give it but where it may ſet its Foot, allow but a ſober
Advertence to its Propoſals, and it will move the whole World: It comes with
moſt convincing Arguments, but theſe muſt firſt obtain Attention,
before they can force Aſſent. They will moſt infallibly weigh down the

            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0544000400:345"/>But it's to be fear'd we are ſo ſtupid and
unconcern'd, that all the perſuaſive Rhetorick of the Goſpel will make no
Impreſſion upon us, all the Avenues of our Reaſon are ſo blocked up,
that they will find no way of approaching. We are like the <hi>Indian</hi>
Serpents <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> mentions, Proof againſt all Charms, but
ſuch as with their glittering Splendor aſſault our Eyes. Nothing moves us
but what courts our Senſes, and what is not groſs enough to be ſeen, we
think too nice to be conſider'd. The Form and Name of Chriſtianity Men find
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to their Hands, and it coſts them no Labour to call themſelves
Chriſtians, as they do <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were born within ſuch a Territory, and have taken up their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as
part of their Fate, the Temper of their Climate, the Entail of their
Anceſtors, the Profeſſion of it deſcends to them by way of Inheritance,
and like young careleſs Heirs, they are never at the Charge to Survey it, to
inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Revenues of it, what Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it lies under, or
what Advantages it promiſes.</p>
            <p>It is to be fear'd that of thoſe vaſt Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes that have
entred the Baptiſmal <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0544000400:346"/> Vows, moſt of them weigh it as

no other Notion of Baptiſm, but as a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Place, or a Time of
Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conſider no farther Significan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in thoſe Spiritual
Bonds, than they did in their Swadling Cloaths; and can give no better account
why they took on them Chriſt's Livery, than why they wear ſuch Garments as
the common Faſhion of the Country preſcribes them: But where Men are ſo
Ignorant, it muſt neceſſarily infer, their Parent's Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence either in
not infuſing, or their own ſtubborn Perverſeneſs in reſiſting
Inſtruction. But it is more probable to conclude the former, ſince if
Children were early inſtructed, Knowledge would inſenſibly inſinuate it
ſelf before their Years had arm'd them with Obſtinacy enough to make Head
againſt it. And when by the Parent's Remiſſneſs the proper Seed-time is
loſt, the Soil grows ſtiff and untractable, the Labour of Learning averts
their Childhood, and the Shame of it their Manhood, and they grow old in their
Ignorance, and are ready to leave the World before they come to know any thing
of that <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0544000400:347"/> which is to ſucceed it. This is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and
deſpicable Caſe, which loudly accuſes their Parents, who thus wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
hazard their Children's greateſt Concernment. And as it was a Fault in their
Parents to let their Children want thoſe neceſſary Infuſions, 'tis
ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo in themſelves, to let their riper Years continue in that
Ignorance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſcarce ever thought of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſince they cou'd
their Leſſon to avoid Correction. And then 'tis no wonder if they paſs in
the ſame Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs with other the Occurrences of that ſlippery Age:
But if to ſome their Memory hath been ſo faithful as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe
early Impreſſions which were made in it; yet alas, it avails little; for a
Man's Remembrance of his Creed may tell him there is a God, and that he is
Almighty; but if his Reaſon be ſo much aſleep as not to infer from thence
the Neceſſity of Reverencing and Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, he may repeat the Creed
eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day, and yet be an Atheiſt.</p>
            <p>The Difficulty of removing what is imprinted in us by Education is
very hard; that which Men take in by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation being next to that which is
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; and moſt Men owe the Principles <pb n="309" facs="tcp:0544000400:348"/> of their
Religion to their Education, or Climate wherein they were Born, being bred up
either to confirm thoſe Principles their Parents inſtilled into them, or by
a general Conſent proceed in the Religion of their Country, there being a
Geography of Religions as well as Lands, and every Climate is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſtinguiſh'd by their Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, but circumſcribed by their
Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, not conſidering whether true or falſe, but only according to
their Intereſt: And if we conſider the Lives of moſt Men of all
Conditions, we ſhall find the Honours and Pleaſures of the World, which we
renounced in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, are the very Gods which ſhare the World amongſt
us.</p>
            <p>Tho' we have ſeen Overturnings of States and Kingdoms, and great
Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yet the true Church, that adores that God that was ever ador'd,
ſubſiſts without Interruption, and that Religion which hath always been

extinguiſhed, yet God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been pleas'd to raiſe and recover it by
Wonders of his Goodneſs and Power; and what is alſo very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable is,
That it hath never ſubmitted <pb n="310" facs="tcp:0544000400:349"/> to yield or bow to the
Will of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, Let us but take a ſerious View of the Apoſtles choſen
by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Thoſe Perſons that were Ignorant and
Unlearned, of a ſuddain were found ſufficiently able to put to Silence the
wiſeſt Philoſophers, and Courageous enough to oppoſe the greateſt
Kings or Tyrants that reſiſted the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they Taught
and Preach'd. If we ſee a Miracle, ſay ſome Men, we would be Converted;
they think there is no more in Converſion, but to believe there is a God,
when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil does that and trembles; but true Converſion conſiſts in
Humbling our ſelves before the Saviour of the World, whom we have ſo often
Povoked, and who might juſtly every Minute deſtroy us; to confeſs, we can
do nothing without him, and that we have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved nothing but his
Diſpleaſure. It conſiſts in acknowledging that there is a great Enmity
betwixt God and us, and without a Mediator we could have had no Acceſs nor
Favour.</p>
            <p>I know very well, that good Men may and often do blemiſh the
Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Piety, by over-acting ſome Things in Religion, by an
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0544000400:350"/> Auſterity and Sourneſs, which Religion
does not require; a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, diſcreet and unaffected Piety makes no
great Noiſe nor Shew, but expreſſes it ſelf in a conſtant ſerious
Devotion, accompanied with good Works and Kindneſs, which makes a Man
pleaſing both to God and his Neighbour: Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion makes Men obedient to
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conformable to Laws; it makes Men Peaceable to each other, it
heals the Natures of Men, and ſweetens their Spirits; it corrects their
Paſſions, and mortifies all thoſe Luſts, which are the Cauſes of
Enmity and Diviſions: If Men would live as Religion requires they ſhould
do, the World would be a quiet Habitation: And the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the
Societies of Men are ſo full of Tumult and Diſorder, is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there
is ſo little true Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; ſo that if it were not for
ſome ſmall Remainders of Piety and Virtue, which are yet ſcatter'd
amongſt Mankind, humane Society would in a ſhort Time disband and run into
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, the Earth would grow wild and become a great Foreſt, and Men
would turn Beaſts of Prey one towards the other: So that Religion hath ſo
great <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0544000400:351"/> an Influence upon the Felicity of Man, that it
ought to be upheld out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their Temporal Peace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, as
well as to their Eternal. Religion does qualify all Sorts of Men, and makes
them in Publick Affairs the more Serviceable, Governors apter to Rule with
Conſcience, and Inferiors for Conſcience Sake the willinger to Obey. And it
is a great Truth, That all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are by ſo much the better perform'd by how
much the Men are more Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious from whoſe Abilities the ſame proceed; and
if Magiſtrates, who are employ'd about the Publick Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of
Juſtice, follow it only as a Trade for Gain's-Sake, the Formality of
Juſtice will then only ſerve to ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Right, and that which was
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ordain'd for the common Good, will be the Cauſe of common
Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Religion has a Superiority above all other Things, and is as
neceſſary to our living Happy in this World, as it is to our being Saved in
the next; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it a Man is an abandon'd Creature, one of the worſt
Beaſts Nature hath produced, and fit only for the Society of Wolves and
Bears, and therefore in <pb n="313" facs="tcp:0544000400:352"/> all Ages it hath been the
Foundation of Government. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>nd
therefore as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is better for being Soure, it would be hard Religion
ſhould be ſo, which is the beſt of Things, and is ſo Cheerful, and ſo
far from being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at odds with good Humour, that it is inſeparably
united to it, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Unpleaſantneſs belongs to it. A Virtue
ſtuck with Briſtles is too rough, it muſt be adorned with ſome Flowers,
or elſe it will be unwillingly entertained; ſo that even where it may be
fit to Strike, do it gently; and where one takes Care to do it, he would wound
others more, and hurt himſelf leſs by ſoft Strokes, than by being harſh
and violent.</p>
            <p>Moſt People keep to that Religion which is grown up with them,
think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the beſt; and the Reaſon of ſtaying in it upon that
Ground, is ſomewhat ſtronger for Women, than will be allow'd for Men, who
are bound to ſearch the Truth.</p>
            <p>Tho' Kings be Gods on Earth, yet they are Subjects of Heaven, and
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God: Religion in a King ſtrengthens his Authority, it
procures Veneration, and gains a Reputation; <pb n="314" facs="tcp:0544000400:353"/> and in all
Publick Affairs, ſo much Reputation is really ſo much Power; and even in
Men of low Degree, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will command ſome Reverence and Reſpect: But
in Perſons of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Place and Dignity, it caſts a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre upon them,
and by a ſtrong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection doubles the Beams of Majeſty; as the
clearneſs of the Eye diſpoſes for a quicker Sight, ſo the clearneſs
of the Mind diſpoſes us to more perfect Acts of Religion. Few Things are
well learnt but by eaſy Precepts, thoſe well infuſed will make them
Natural, and we are never ſure of retaining what is valuable, till by
continual Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit we have made it a Piece of us.</p>
            <p>We muſt not think the Rewards of Heaven, like ripe Fruit upon a
full laden Bough, ſhould ſtoop down to us, to be taken by every idle and
wanton Hand: That Heaven ſhould be proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to the lazy Deſires and
ordinary Endeavours of Slothful Men. God will not ſo much diſparage eternal
Life and Happineſs, as to beſtow it upon thoſe who have ſo low an
Opinion of it, as not to think it worth taking Pains for. We muſt uſe our
beſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, doing what we can, and <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0544000400:354"/> then we may
expect God's gracious Aſſiſtance: But when Men expect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould
coſt them no Pains, and that Happineſs ſhould drop into their Laps
without any Labour on their Part, and that God ſhould ſnatch them up into
Heaven when they Die, as he did the good Thief, they will at laſt find
themſelves much miſtaken in their Meaſures: 'Tis troubleſome at
firſt, I confeſs, for a Man to begin a new Life; but when he begins to
habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate himſelf to a Religious and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Life, the Trouble will ſoon
go off, and unſpeakable Pleaſure ſucceed in its Place. It was an
excellent Rule, which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> gave to his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <hi>Optimum
vitae genus eligito nam conſuetudo faciet jucundiſſimum: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
always to do what is moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and Cuſtom will ſoon make it
Eaſie.</hi> And thoſe, who upon Pretence of the Difficulties of Religion,
aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don themſelves to a wicked Courſe of Life, may eaſily be convinced,
(tho' perhaps when 'tis too late) that they took more Pains to make
themſelves Miſerable, than would have been to bring them to
Happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:0544000400:355"/>The Difference betwixt an Atheiſt and an
Enthuſiaſt is this: The Atheiſt thinks nothing Unlawful, as believing no
God to judge him: An Enthuſiaſt thinks every Thing that comes into his Head
not only Lawful, but the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, and as ſuch is promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with
a fiery Zeal to propagate it with the Hazard of his Life, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of
Government, and embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World: And when a Man is once fully
poſſeſs'd with this Spirit, which works upon his Imagination, his
Reaſon is wholly clouded, his Diſcourſes are inconſiſtent, he has
nothing in his View but his preſent Impulſe, and as that alters, he
purſues the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, with the ſame Vehemence, not reflecting that
it is oppoſite to his former Sentiments. Now this is moſt certainly a great
Exceſs of Pride, which yet recommends it ſelf to many well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclined and
religiouſly diſpoſed Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, under the Notion of Abſtraction from the
World, of Humility, and Self-Denial: For what greater Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ones
ſelf can be imagin'd, and indeed Rebellion againſt God, than to think my
ſelf exempted, upon account of my own Holineſs, from thoſe
Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions <pb n="317" facs="tcp:0544000400:356"/> which God has appointed, and from that
Authority which he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd amongſt Men, and by whoſe Hands he does
diſpence his Bleſſings to us? What greater Deluſion than to think, that
we can contrive a ſhorter and ſafer Way to Heaven than that which God hath
commanded us? Not to be contented with that Station wherein he hath placed us,
but to raiſe our ſelves above that Order by which he governs the World,
(who as long as they adminiſter Juſtice are to be revered as God's
Vicegerents up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth;) to deſpiſe Dominion, and ſpeak Evil of
Dignities, which is a ſign of Reprobation: It is no leſs, than aſſuming
the Power of God to our ſelves, to uſurp his Throne, and as far as in us
lies to take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World out of his Hands: All this is the
Effect of Enthuſiaſm: All the Looſeneſs and Wickedneſs of this Age is
to have no Principles, but guided wholly by our Humour and Fancy; and moſt of
the Hereſies or Schiſms which have divided the Church came from this
Fountain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:0544000400:357"/>St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> tell us, That the
mighty Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and ſtrong Proſperity of the <hi>Romans</hi> was a Reward
given them by God for their eminent Juſtice and other Virtues: As to
particular Perſons, the Providences of God are promiſcuouſly given in
this World; ſo that we cannot certainly conclude, God's Love or Hatred to any
Perſon by any thing that befals him in this Life: But God deals otherwiſe
with Nations, becauſe Publick States and Communities, as ſuch, can only be
rewarded and puniſhed in this World; for in the next, all Publick Societies
will be diſſolved, and every Man ſhall give an Account of himſelf to
God: The great crying Sins of a Nation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope to eſcape Publick
Judgments, which God may defer for a Time to give People a longer ſpace of
Repentance, but ſooner or later they have Reaſon to expect his Vengeance.
God hath Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Feet, but Iron Hands, he is longere he puniſhes, but
ſtrikes home at laſt; and uſually the longer Puniſhment is delay'd, it
is the heavier when it comes. Experience in all Ages hath made this good We
find through the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament the interchangeable
Providences of God, towards the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0544000400:358"/> of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> always ſuited to their Manners. They were conſtantly
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous or Afflicted, as Virtue and Piety flouriſhed and declined
amongſt them. And thus God deals with all others: The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
whilſt that People remained Virtuous, was firm and ſtrong as Iron; but upon
Diſſolution of their Manners, the Iron was ſoon mixed with miry Clay, and
the Feet upon which that Empire ſtood were ſoon broken.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are found admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Occurrences in the Lives of all Men, but
much more in Princes, who moving in a higher Sphere, their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are more
conſpicuous and worthy to be tranſmitted to Poſterity, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to their Succeſſors: And tho' Proſperity is more agreeable to our
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet Adverſity is more Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, when Princes make a right
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it, to ſhun thoſe Rocks whereon ſome Princes have been
ſplit.</p>
            <p>It is very neceſſary to accuſtom a young Prince to divert
himſelf amongſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Men; one cannot find a more ſure and leſs
painful Way to render him a moſt accompliſht Prince, than having ſuch
Courtiers about him in his Youth; (but the Difficulty is to find ſuch:) A
Prince will not fail to learn inſenſibly <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0544000400:360"/> the Manners
and Actions of thoſe; and whatſoever he gains that way becomes Natural to
him. Thoſe that are near him ſhould make uſe, as much as is poſſible,
of that way to Inſtruct him; it being abſolutely neceſſary, that
thoſe who have Wit, and are well-bred Men, ſhould not only be receiv'd by
the Prince, but that Means be taken to find them out, for commonly ſuch Men
are not over-forward to ſhew themſelves: They know how to be Content with
their own ſmall Fortunes; and beſides, ſuch Men are ſo rarely met with,
that thoſe who underſtand them, need not fear to be troubled with too many
of them; for I do not remember, in all my Time, (who have ſpent many Years in
the World) to have ſeen ſo few of them as at preſent.</p>
            <p>To make a Prince ſpeak well, it is neceſſary to mix a little
Art and Study, and a Prince ought to have ſomething of both; for to the
compleating of a worthy honeſt Man, there is nothing more neceſſary than
well-Speaking and well-Doing: What Gracefulneſs ſo clear a Source gives to
all our Actions? How doth it beautifie our Words and Thoughts? How amiable a
Thing it is <pb n="322" facs="tcp:0544000400:361"/> to Speak well when Sincerity goes along with
it?</p>
            <p>Young Princes are commonly more Active than Speculative, and moſt
ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily carried away with the Pleaſures of the World; yet there are ſome,
who by Nature are ſerious enough, and are capable to retire into
themſelves, as King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and King <hi>James</hi> the
Second. It were to be wiſhed, that a young Prince, be neither too Active, nor
too Serious, the beſt Temper is to partake of both, and be able to paſs
with Eaſe from the one to the other. Some Attempts might be made to give a
young Prince the Apprehenſion of certain Things with which Children are not
to entertain themſelves, as ſurpaſſing their ordinary Capacity; for
tho' a Child underſtands not at firſt what is ſaid to them, yet it
prepares him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another time, and they are as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Eſſays of
Reaſon, which come not all at once. It is neceſſary for him that would
attain Virtues, to begin gradually at the loweſt Step, to guard his Senſes,
and ſet a watch upon the Avenues of his Paſſions, for Man becomes neither
perfectly Virtuous or Vitious all at once; and <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of
<hi>Syrach</hi> hath ſaid, <pb n="323" facs="tcp:0544000400:362"/> 
               <hi>He that contemns little
Things ſhall fall by little and little.</hi> The ſmalleſt Occaſion
ſuffices to ſay ſomething that pleaſes; and it is of much Importance to
form a Prince's Will agreeably, for then he will take Pleaſure to hearken to
a Man that hath Judgment and Wit, and will be deſirous to be inſtructed by
him: And if Perſons about a Prince have a Grace in their Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Prince will retain the Manner how to behave and expreſs himſelf. This
agreeable way of Talking is of great Conſequence, and the ſureſt way to
acquire it, is to let ſuch as have and practiſe it, come into the Prince's
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: Thoſe Princes who are young, and underſtand not all that's ſaid
to them, want often that ſome Body put them in Mind; and when Princes keep
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with ſuch, they take ſome Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations which they ſhould
never have of themſelves; and we our ſelves find, if many Things had been
diſcover'd to us in our Youth, which we have ſince found by our own
Experience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, we had ſaved much Time; and one Word to the
Purpoſe then, had made us comprehend a World of Things, which we know not,
nor ſhall ever know whilſt we live: But we reflect not 
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0544000400:363"/> on thoſe Opportunities till we have loſt them, and
we are not aware of them, till it be too late: All the World com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Faults,
but the greateſt are only perceived.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have the Education of young Princes ſhould endeavour
to make them Love or Hate that, which deſerves the one or the other, that the
Prince may have a good Taſte or Diſcernment, for this would make him
underſtand what he ſhould Learn, and the Means to be excellent in it: For
if a Prince had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand a right Apprehenſion of Good and Evil, the very
Courſe of Things would inſtruct him, and the Averſion to what is Evil,
whenſoever he ſaw it, would be ſufficient to avoid it: A young Prince
cannot have too curious a Taſte to diſcern betwixt true and falſe
Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and not to be deceiv'd in either. The moſt agreeable way of
inſtructing, is, to do that Well, which we ſee others do Ill, by which we
make our Life more eaſie: Beſides, thoſe that are about a young Prince,
ſhould endeavour, that the Wit and Heart of the Prince ſhould be
diſpoſed as they ought to be: 'Tis true that Wit finds out the way to
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perfection, but the Heart is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to put in Practice what is
judged <pb n="325" facs="tcp:0544000400:364"/> to be the <hi>Beſt</hi>; and that which we call
the having a good Taſte or Diſcernment is ofteneſt found in a young
Prince, who is uſually born with more than an ordinary Genius; tho' a late
Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Philoſopher holds, That all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Naturally have near the ſame
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and that the chief Difference proceeds from the Care that is taken
to inform Children: But I think the firſt Advantage is rather to be
aſcribed to a happy Birth, and that Art does af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards perfect it; and I
have always believed we ſhould not ſo much wiſh for any thing in a young
Prince, as Wit, it being impoſſible not to have it, if he be Educated in
the Company of ſome People; as to the learning by <hi>ones</hi> ſelf, it
very ſeldom happens that the Mind, without ſome extraordinary Help, takes
the right Courſe to do it: 'Tis true indeed, our late King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second was a very excellent and knowing Man, and had a great Inſight into
Men and Manners; tho' in his Youth, by the Reaſon of our inteſtine
Troubles, and the Rebellion raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Royal Father, he was Taught
very little; yet he had an excellent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor in his tender Years, which was
the Marquis of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and after him, <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0544000400:365"/> the
Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>; but when that Prince went Generaliſſimo into
the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> his Highneſs had the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and
<hi>weakeſt</hi> Man for his Governor that I ever ſaw; yet they who had
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Prince, and were near a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, inſtructed him in ſo
pleaſant a Way, that he was moſt agreeable in Converſation; And when he
came to the Throne, if he had loved Buſineſs as well as he underſtood it,
he had been one of the greateſt Princes of the laſt Age; but he was wholly
addicted to his Pleaſures, and Chamber-Practice, which much ſhortned his
Days; and yet he may be reckon'd amongſt the moſt admir'd Princes of his
Time, who had form'd and inſtructed himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the beſt-bred
Princes in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A young Prince ſhould never be over burthen'd with a long Chain of
Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; his Tutor ſhould rather chuſe to ſpeak few Things, and
let each Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept take its Effect, and ſhould give the Prince a Reaſon of
all he tells him; ſo that the Prince of his own Accord might inſenſibly
make the Application to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; it being much better to enlighten his
Underſtanding, than to charge his Memory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0544000400:366"/>And above all Things, he ſhould teach the
Prince to be Free and Affable, which Virtues make Princes to be belov'd; and it
is of great Conſequence for a young Prince to have the Art of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himſelf be belov'd: When Majeſty and Civility are mix'd together, it makes
Men find with Pleaſure that ſuch Princes are their Maſters. The more
Princes condeſcend, the more ready are their Servants to ſubmit,
eſpecially if they be well-bred Perſons, who never preſume too much. The
moſt Eminent Princes were wont to communicate freely, and were very familiar:
<hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſo with his own Soldiers, which ſo charm'd them, that
when they fought for his Glory, they found nothing difficult, and were not
apprehenſive of Danger, (Heaven takes thoſe Hearts into its Protection,)
and in fighting Fifty Battels, which <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> did without loſing
one, he was always very Active, and yet never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd any Hurt: Such Princes
are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways belov'd; and tho' Fortune (which is ever inconſtant) leaves their
Side, yet Glory and Honour never forſake them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> was of this Number: He had nothing in him, which
ſavour'd not of Grandeur; he was brave and full of <pb n="328" facs="tcp:0544000400:367"/>
Civility; he would hazard his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to ſave the meaneſt of his
Soldiers. He lov'd all thoſe that loved his Fortune; he ſhar'd with them
the Glory, as he did the Danger; he underſtood well how to make himſelf be
Belov'd, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Ameris, Ama,</hi> which is a ſure way if it be perform'd
handſomely; the principal Secret conſiſts in managing it ſo, that the
Perſons whom one loves ſhould be glad of it.</p>
            <p>There is nothing ſo much to be fear'd in a young Prince, as giving
him an ill Maſter; for the beſt Natural Parts would be but of little uſe,
if Care be not taken to improve them: One can never take any thing right
without having learnt it; and who can believe that either to do a Thing well,
or to do it better, if one doth it well, that Study can ever hinder it: We
ſee in all Exerciſes, how much good Maſters are neceſſary; and it
were very ſtrange, that the Body ſhould be capable of Inſtruction, and
not the Mind; for what likelyhood is there, that Practice and good Maſters
are effectual to make a young Man skillful in riding the Great Horſe, and
that to the making of an accompliſh'd Perſon, they ſhould both be
needleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:0544000400:368"/>The Body and the Mind are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as one
would wiſh; but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Body ſeem more difficult to be
corrected; for the Mind is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſupple, and may be redreſs'd if a
right Courſe be taken; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it falls out otherwiſe is,
when we learn to do a Thing of an ill Maſter, one learns to do it ill; and it
is much more difficult to chuſe good Maſters for framing the Mind, than for
the Body, for the Advantages of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are much more remarkable than thoſe
of the Mind: To be able and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to ſuch a Degree as one would have a
great Prince, one cannot know too many Things, if we have Skill to make a right
Uſe of them, and know how to Value them; but to have read much, or to have
learnt a Number of different Opinions, diſcovers nothing of Certainty; for we
know nothing well but what we ſee clearly, and that which we can make others
ſee preſently, and underſtand if they be clear-ſighted, and we ſhould
miſtruſt all which we ſee as through a Cloud, and which we cannot make
plain to the Sight of another. There are ſome Princes who would have been
very gallant Men, if Care had been taken at firſt to put them in a right way,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0544000400:369"/> and to have ſhew'd them what was to be done. For a
great Prince, upon whom the Happineſs of the Publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, by whoſe
Example his People will faſhion themſelves, as being the moſt noble
Model, no Care in the World ſhould be neglected: The Buſineſs is to make
a young Prince Happy, and that all who live under him may be ſo; it being
reaſonable that thoſe ſhould a little ſhare in the Happineſs who are
in Duty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Sacrifice themſelves for proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it; and
therefore this firſt Point of their Education is of much greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to them, than to private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: For when Princes are no longer under the
Conduct of Governors, all that they do, or ſay, is approv'd, or at leaſt it
is ſo in Appearance; For no Perſon comes into their Preſence but with a
deſign to pleaſe them, becauſe altho' he loves them, yet one eaſily
inclines to love their Favour more; and it were a great Imprudence for any Man
to draw the Hatred of his Prince upon himſelf, and to adviſe him as he
would one of his particular Friends, unleſs at firſt the Prince had
ſignified his Pleaſure to have it ſo: However, thoſe Perſons that are
near about Princes that be young, (if they are not too much ſway'd by
Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt) <pb n="331" facs="tcp:0544000400:370"/> may very ſecurely tell them in an
agreeable manner, all which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their Glory and Happineſs:
'Tis certain, a very eaſie Thing to give them good Advice as to their Glory,
but it is not ſo to their Happineſs, which depends more upon the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
and whoſoever will aſcertain a Prince what will make him happy, muſt know
him perfectly well, for moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we our ſelves know not what would be
beſt for our own Happineſs: But when all is done, it ſeems to me, that
with a very little Help, it were no difficult Thing for a young Prince to be
happy.</p>
            <p>Certainly, that young Prince is in a fair way to it, who ſees
himſelf one of the firſt amongſt the Maſters of the World, and that
Fortune hath nothing greater to give. And therefore Princes ſhould conſider
what Pleaſure it is to do good, that there is nothing more Noble, and that
this Delight was made only for Princes. For the more Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours they beſtow,
the more they are in Condition to grant, provided their Gifts be with Choice
and Eſteem, which ſupports their Grandeur, and renders them more Powerful:
It is not Riches that are principally deſir'd from Kings, but 
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0544000400:371"/> Employments and Truſts, and that which makes Men
deſire high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, is not for Conveniency of Life, for their Lives are by
them made more troubleſome; but it is Hopes of making it appear, that they
have Merit in them and are uſeful to the Publick; and when juſt Perſons
that have Worth and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are put into Employments, they make themſelves
ſoon known, and their Princes are well ſerv'd: We have lately ſeen in
<hi>England,</hi> a ſad Example of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king falſe Meaſures herein; the ill
Choice of our late King's Miniſters was his Ruin: Beſides, what greater
Slavery can there be, than that Princes are chain'd to their Poſts, and
cannot make themſelves <hi>leſs,</hi> all their Words and Actions are
deſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, and made publick Diſcourſe. A Prince cannot with Dignity
quit his Guards. Fortune hath him in Cuſtody, a Train beſets him where-ever
he goes, and there is no making an Eſcape, but ſtill he that is the
Maſter of many is the Servant of more.</p>
            <p>The great and honourable Fame of a King in this World depends more
upon his wiſe Adminiſtration than upon his private Morals; the Goodneſs
of his Government depends chiefly upon thoſe that adviſe him, and execute
under him; it being an infallible Maxim, <hi>That he</hi> 
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:0544000400:372"/> 
               <hi>is the worſt (at leaſt the moſt unhappy) King, who hath
the worſt Councellors and Miniſters under him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Princes ſhould endeavour to couple Warlike and peaceable Virtues
together, to know at all times how to Rule their own State, and protect their
Subjects; to honour the Good, and chaſtiſe the Wicked; to change the
Pleaſures of the Body into thoſe of the Mind, to ſeek their Content in
the Acquiſition of thoſe Things which may raiſe them above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perſons: But this Perfection is not eaſily met with at Court, where every
Thing ſtands in Oppoſition to good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; Princes are born to govern,
and therefore they muſt govern well, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out amuſing themſelves with
Knowledge more curious than uſeful, which would better become a Profeſſor
of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy than a Prince.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt but Sciences do adorn the Titles of Princes, as
Diadems do their Heads, and Jewels their Crowns, but the moſt neceſſary
Philoſophy for a Prince, is to know how to do Juſtice to his People, and to
defend them from their Enemies, and to underſtand what Perſons are able to
ſerve him well; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs many Princes enter upon the Government before
they have paſs'd an <pb n="334" facs="tcp:0544000400:373"/> Apprentiſhip for it, and take
leaſt Care of what concerns them moſt.</p>
            <p>Foreign Languages are moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for a Prince, and
ſerve for a great Ornament to him; the Princes Electors of <hi>Germany</hi>
would admit no Man here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore to the Imperial Dignity, unleſs he was able to
ſpeak <hi>Latin, Italian, Sclavonian</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>; and the
Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Frederick</hi> the Second could beſides ſpeak elegant
<hi>French, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh,</hi> which was very rare in his
time: He was alſo skilful in the ancient vulgar <hi>Greek</hi>; and indeed
the Intercourſe of Princes, who live upon the Continent, permits them not to
neglect theſe Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages without running a great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency. The
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Genius for clear ſpeaking and writing is always to the
Point; they look upon rambling Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſes with Contempt, and as Men of
Reaſon, they ſtand more upon Strength of Argument, than all the Pomp of
Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, not ſo much concern'd to move the Hearer's Affections, as to warm
his Reaſon. Perhaps no Nation is more Satyrical and quicker in Repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees,
which argues Wit to expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſignificantly; we have a moſt
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Language, compounded chiefly of <hi>Saxon, Latin</hi> and
<hi>French,</hi> of which <pb n="335" facs="tcp:0544000400:374"/> 
               <hi>Saxon</hi> is the Stock,
the other two being ingrafted into it. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> is ſo
ſignificant that it does almoſt equalize the <hi>Greek,</hi> and does even
exceed the <hi>Latin,</hi> in a particular Grace of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Words, which
is as great a Beauty as can be in Language. In Point of Sweetneſs, the
<hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> run ſmoother, but they want Sinews,
eſpecially the laſt. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtical but
boiſterous; the High-<hi>Dutch</hi> Manly, but very harſh; whereas the
<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> is both ſweet and manly. If we look upon the famous Men
of our Nation, which have been Learned, or Soldiers, we ſhall find many very
famous, as Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> Lord <hi>Bacon,
Smith, Spelman, Camden, Selden, Daniel, Drayton, Ben. Johnſon, Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear,
Beaumont, Fletcher,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Sidney, Cowley, Oldham, Dryden,</hi>
and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. But is impoſſible to learn Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages without travelling,
which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhes the Minds of thoſe that uſe it prudently: A young
Prince that travels will underſtand Nations, imitate what they have of good,
and avoid the reſt; he ſhould heedfully regard the Laws and Fundamental
Maxims of State, the Inclinations of Sovereigns, their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, the Order of
their Courts, their <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0544000400:375"/> Alliances, their Power, and their
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites; that Prince who hath ſeen <hi>Europe</hi> with Judgement knows
every thing that can carry him to glorious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and certainly a young
Prince that travils, profits more in two Years, than if he had ſtay'd in his
Study ten Years; Travel teaches them to underſtand the Plenty of Countries,
the Force of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and which are the moſt eminent Places of Traffick and
Commerce, the Convenience of Bridges, the diſtance of Places, the Strength
and Situation of Cities and Caſtles, the Number of the People, the
Inclination of the Subjects, the Humour of Princes, the Sympathy and Antipathy
of Nations, and many other things which may inſtruct a General of an Army to
fortifie Places, to entrench, to Camp an Army advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly, to draw up a
Body of Men in Battle, to lead an Army to fight, and to ſhew themſelves
eminent Examples to their Followers. Travel alſo gives a Prince Leſſons
of Temperance, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and Patience; and the Languages which are uſeful to
all Men are moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Princes, and to thoſe who would have any
Command of Armies. <hi>Spaniſh</hi> is the nobleſt of all Baſtard
Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, it not being a Mother-Tongue, <pb n="337" facs="tcp:0544000400:376"/> but compounded
of <hi>Latin, Gothick, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi>: The <hi>Romans,
Goths</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> having reign'd ſome Ages in that Country, did
introduce a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all thoſe Languages. A Prince ſhould alſo learn
the Mathematicks, which will teach him to beſiege, and fortifie Places.
Theſe are the moſt needful Studies for a Prince, and not to ſpend his
time upon Logical Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but to chuſe ſuch Studies as are proportionable
to his Condition: It is ſufficient that a Prince be ready in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and
prophane Hiſtory; that he take a Delight in ſome Books, and ſometimes
conſult the dead, who will ſay that which none of the living dare ſay to
him; he ſhould read ſuch Books as may teach him to know the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
his Friends and Enemies; he ſhould learn Principles of Generoſity and
Honour diſtinctly; to know thoſe that love the Publick Good and
Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and to favour them with ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices as they deſerve, and to
puniſh them that do otherwiſe: And tho' it be honourable for Kings to
aggrandize their beſt Deſerving Subjects, yet a Prince ought not to
diffuſe his Graces too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally, leaſt the Servant ſhould become the
Maſter; which in all Courts, and at <pb n="338" facs="tcp:0544000400:377"/> all times hath
proved very prejudicial. The Planets would have little Regard to the Sun, if
they had no need of his Light, nor a Servant of his Maſter, if he could do
him no good; Princes ought therefore to be circumſpect in Diſtribution of
their Favours, if they would not loſe that Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which their
Subjects give them. A King gives an Account of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to none but God; he
ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs to act equitably, and not to plunge brave Men into
Deſpair, than which nothing is more dangerous, who having loſt their
Eſtates by their moſt faithful and long Services, thinking they have
nothing more to loſe, are capable to make the greateſt report of their
Wrongs; 'tis true, Kings may take the Benefits beſtowed, when they that
received them become unworthy of them; but before a King comes to that
Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he ſhould endeavour to reduce them to their Duty, and having
tried all fair Ways, the Prince muſt be careful not faintly to execute his
Reſolution, nor raſhly to enter upon a great Action, which in Prudence he
muſt afterwards abandon. A Prince ſhould think ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of a Thing
before he enters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, but having begun, he ſhould car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0544000400:378"/> it through, for there is nothing more repugnant to
Authority of Kings than to act by halfs, nor any thing that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages
Subjects ſo much to Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to ſee their Maſters are afraid of
them. A Prince ought to ſpend ſome Time in reading, eſpecially Hiſtory,
which will render him able and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it is a good Guide, and what
concerns Life which it does antidate, and makes the Reader contemporary with
the Times paſt, and by running up beyond his Nativity, the Prince will be
ſomething the wiſer for it, and will have a Stock of Senſe, without much
Trouble of his own; and it is of great Uſe to perſwade by Example that
which we have a Mind to. Hiſtory is a kind of Experience, and we may reap
much by it; beſides there are ſome Hiſtories written by ſo good Hands,
which tho' we know, yet it is a Pleaſure to read them, as <hi>Thucidides,
Polibius, Caeſar</hi>'s <hi>Commentaries,</hi> with the Duke of
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> and Sir <hi>Clement Edmond</hi>'s Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon them,
and <hi>Hugo Grotius de Jure Pacis &amp; Belli,</hi> and <hi>Selden</hi>'s
<hi>Mare clauſum</hi>; but to read over much, and to be conſtantly poring
upon Books, brings neither Pleaſure nor Profit. Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much
over-charges Nature; it <pb n="340" facs="tcp:0544000400:379"/> is Thought and Digeſtion that
makes Reading profitable, which being well managed gives a great Inſight into
all Things. He that depends upon his own Experience, hath but a few Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
to work upon, and to take Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures wholly from Books without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into
Men and Buſineſs, is like tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in a Map, where only Countries and
Cities are well diſtinguiſh'd; but Villages and private Houſes are
ſeldom or never marked.</p>
            <p>Young Princes, after ſome Hours in their Study, ſhould beſtow
ſome others upon Sports, becauſe the Mind being taken up too long with
Contemplation will diſreliſh Study, if it be not refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome
Recreations, in which Hunting is one of the moſt agreeable to Princes; and
becauſe Youth runs eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly down the Hill towards Pleaſures, therefore
Princes ſhould ſometimes play at Tennis; tho' moſt commonly young Princes
would rather endure the Pains of Hunting a whole Day than ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but two
Hours, which they think a Labour, which is really nothing but pure Delight, and
Studying would be a ſenſual Pleaſure, if the Mind were capable of any in
thoſe younger Years. For thoſe that have once taſted it can 
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0544000400:380"/> never take themſelves off again in ſuch Manner that
they become deſpicable and good for nothing elſe. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
Hunting has always been the Recreation of Princes, nor never diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
but by thoſe that know not the Benefit of it. It withdraws the great Men
about the Prince from Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is the Mother of all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or from
Gaming, which is unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Condition: It makes Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſtrong,
active and bold. Almoſt all Princes love Hunting, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to
it, becauſe it is a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of War; a good Huntſman is, or may
eaſily be a good Soldier. To ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the Wolf or the Fox, a Man muſt
uſe a certain Subtilty, which teaches us to lay Ambuſhes for the Enemy. To
take a wild Boar, one muſt know how to preſent the Boar Spear to
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, juſt as one would do a Pike or a Halbert when two Bodies of
Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers come to puſh of Pike. To ſhoot a Deer or Hare running, a Patridge
or a Quale flying, one muſt be as good a Markſ-man as the beſt Fuſileer
in the Army; beſides, Hunting enures a Prince to endure Hunger, Thirſt,
Heat, Cold, Rain, Snow, and all the Incommodities of <pb n="342" facs="tcp:0544000400:381"/> the
Air, without which it is impoſſible to be a good Soldier.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, Princes ſhould endeavour to couple Moral and Martial
Virtues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: I know Liberality is counted the proper Virtue of a Prince,
it being much better for him to be Profuſe than Covetuous, Prodigality having
a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of ſomething more noble than Avarice, and really it is
leſs odious: Nay, thoſe that gain by it make it paſs for a Virtue; but
perhaps it is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to Poſterity, and more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than the
other Extream: For tho' a King ſhould give away his whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he would
not ſatisfie all that ask: No, nor all that think they deſerve much of him:
It is then more convenient to give with Reaſon, and never to draw ſo near
the Bottom, but that the Prince may always have wherewith to gratifie Perſons
of Merit; and above all, the Prince ſhould take ſpecial Care, that his
Liberalities be exerciſed without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his People, to avoid
Murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, which is the ready way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Rebellion. But there is little
need at this Time of making Laws againſt giving too much, Princes are not too
free in this Age; and there are not many that want an Overſeer in 
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0544000400:382"/> this kind, eſpecially in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court.
It is certain, that Kings, by the Eminency of their Places, are highly obliged
to Integrity, becauſe the leaſt Blemiſh in them grows up to a monſtrous
Deformity. They are the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> upon which all other Orbs
depend; and <hi>Aſſiadorus</hi> ſays it were more credible that Nature
ſhould Err, than for a Prince to frame a Commonwealth different from the
Conſtitution of his own Life; he being a Glaſs iſſuing forth Incentives
to Imitation; and where that is wanting, the Government cannot long
ſubſiſt. Was not <hi>Rome</hi> Warlike under <hi>Romulus,</hi> Religious
under <hi>Numa,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent under <hi>Fabricius,</hi> Diſſolute under
<hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Antony,</hi> Idolatrous under <hi>Julian,</hi>
Immerged in <hi>Arianiſm</hi> under <hi>Valens?</hi> To ſhew that People
are always moulded into the Temper of their Prince, and where that is not, the
Government is ſhort. And we find in Holy Writ, Judgment threatned to Princes,
who have been a Snare inſtead of a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Subjects: And St.
<hi>Auguſtin</hi> calls them the worſt of Homicides, in deſtroying the
Souls of their Subjects; and therefore that King who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands his Duty to
God, cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, how many Obligations of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <pb n="344" facs="tcp:0544000400:383"/> are annexed to a Crown, ſince the Lives of his Subjects are
ſhaded under his Protection; and ſince a King medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates between God and his
People, it is as neceſſary that he ſhould adhere firſt to God, as he
would have his People be faithful to him; ſo that he muſt in the firſt
Place conſecrate himſelf, next his Kingdom, to the Service of his Creator;
and whoever does not this, he overturns both Divine and Humane Laws: Kings are
not to be eſteemed Happy for their Conqueſts, but by uſing their Power in
the Advancement of God's Honour and Service. The Royal Dignity is not
ſufficiently great of it ſelf to render him Happy that injoys it, by the
ſole conſidering what he is; for if a King be left alone without any
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to think of himſelf at Leiſure, he will find himſelf to be a
Man full of Miſeries, and that feels them as well as other common Perſons;
and therefore carefully to avoid this, there never fail to be near the
Perſons of Kings a great many that continually watch to make Divertiſements
for Princes, and ſupply their leiſure Time, with Pleaſures and
Paſtimes, that none of their Time may be vacant; which is to ſay, that
Kings are encompaſſed round with Perſons that <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0544000400:384"/> are
very careful Kings ſhould not be alone to think of themſelves, knowing very
well that a King, as he is, he would be very Miſerable if he ſhould be left
alone; and indeed, the chief thing that ſupports Men in great Employments is,
that they are perpetually hindred from Thinking of themſelves, for it is the
Noiſe and Buſtle that divert us, and is moſt grateful; Men have a
ſecret Inſtinct that intices them to ſeek Divertiſements, which
proceeds from the continual Senſe of their Miſery, and they feel another
ſecret Inſtinct that remains from the Greatneſs of their firſt Nature,
which makes them know that their Happineſs conſiſts only in Reſt; and
theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Inſtincts flatter them, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction they
expect will come, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Door that will admit them to Reſt, which is
uſually ſought by ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with ſome Oppoſition in vain: And
therefore <hi>Cyneas</hi> the Philoſopher ſaid well to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi>
who promiſed he would enjoy his Pleaſures with his Friends, when he had
conquered a good Part of the World: But <hi>Cyneas</hi> told him, he would do
better to advance his own Happineſs by injoying that Reſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than to ſeek it by ſo many Troubles; but <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> could not be
Happy, either <pb n="346" facs="tcp:0544000400:385"/> before or after Conquering a great Part of
the World; and the ſenſual Life his Miniſters adviſed him to was leſs
able to content him, than the Agitation of ſo great Wars, and ſo many
Voyages as he deſigned.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, Man hunts after Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all his Actions; for all
Men deſire to be Happy, and what ever different Means they uſe, all tends
to this End; it is the ſame Deſire in both, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines one to go the
War, and the other not to go; the Will doth never move one Step, but with
regard to this Object of Felicity: It is the true and real Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of all Men's
Actions; nay, even of thoſe that Hang themſelves: When Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe
their Prince is Liberal, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and Prudent, they will more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily obey
his Will and receive his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands with Reſpect; but to gain the Reputation
of being a Prudent Prince, he ſhould be very careful that his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and Servants be Friends to the Publick Good, that they be Affable, Modeſt and
Generous: The Prince muſt ſhew a conſtant Reſolution to maintain his
People in their ancient Splendour: That Adverſity caſt him not down, nor
Proſperity make him Inſolent; and to give a fairer Luſtre to his
Liberality, <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0544000400:386"/> he ſhould take Care that what he beſtows
do not ariſe out of the Oppreſſion of any, and being ſuch without
drawing his Sword, or giving much to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, his Friends and Enemies too
will eſteem him Valiant, Liberal, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and all of them fearing to
offend him, will pay him the Duties of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Friends and Neighbours; and
he need not doubt but God will diſſipate his Enemies, and all the mutinous
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Deſigns of his malicious Subjects and ambitious Neighbours.</p>
            <p>We muſt know that Kings are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a double Capacity,
that of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and that of Policy; the Politick Body never dies, and is never
defective of Authority or Direction; the Acts of the Body Politick are not
abated by the Natural Body's Acceſs. The Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick is not diſabled to
govern by the Nonage of the Natural, by the 26 <hi>lib. Aſſiſ.
Placit.</hi> 24. Juſtice <hi>Thorp</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, That the Gift of the
King is not defeated by his Nonage: And in the <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> Title
<hi>Droit, Placit.</hi> 24. in the Sixth Year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third, a Writ of Right was brought by the King of a Manor, as Heir to King
<hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the Second, the Exceptions of Nonage againſt the King was
not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0544000400:387"/> for tho' the Natural Body dies, the
Politick never dies. So in the 4th of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Leaſes of
the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> made by <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, were
reſolved by all the Judges to be good, tho' made in the King's Minority; and
the Change of Religion made by <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth in his Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was
good, tho' he had not Age to diſcern what he did, being then in the Hands of
his Uncle the Protector; and if Catholicks ſhould pretend to make void the
Change of Religion made in that King's Time, becauſe of his Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they
would be laughed at by all the World, and their Pretence would be
ridiculous.</p>

of Life. 'Tis true, the Devil can do no more but tempt us, his Power (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
great) is limited, tho' we cannot eaſily ſet out the Bounds of it; he has
his Chains of Reſtraint, as well as Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: It ſeems an Invaſion of
God's Prerogative, and a giving the Devil more than his Due, to allow him a
Power of immediate and impreſſive <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0544000400:390"/> Injection into our
Minds, without the Help of our own innate Corruptions; for 'tis by theſe we
hold the Candle to him, and the Wedge too of the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation whilſt he drives
it; the Mud is ſtill in the Bottom, he does but ſtir it up by ſhaking it,
or drawing it forth by ſome outward Objects. There is no eaſier Way to
out-reach a Man, than to out-end him. If once the Devil can get a Man to
ſhoot with him in his own Bow, and make his Engines a Man's End, the Match is
loſt (as we uſe to ſay) in the very making.</p>
            <p>Now if any Man will but ſeriouſly try, he ſhall find it more
poſſible to with-hold his Affection from the Things of this World, than
enjoy the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Taſte in it. <hi>Socrates</hi> had more true
Joy in ſafely looking on all the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympick Games, and thanking the Gods, that
they had made him not to need the many things they had made for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Purſuits, than <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous obtaining them, which
made <hi>Socrates</hi> cry out, <hi>Quos diderunt dii qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus non indigeo.</hi>
'Tis worth our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to conſider the Toil that ſuch Men take, who
are in love with the Pleaſures of this World, to eternize, if poſſible,
their earthly Happineſs by a <pb n="352" facs="tcp:0544000400:391"/> Succeſſion of
Variety, and to take off the Wearineſs of one Pleaſure by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, between
the Oil and the Wine, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks. <hi>Homines inter vinum
&amp; oleum occupati</hi>; but all in vain; for after thoſe few evaporated
Minutes of Pleaſure, the Body quietly fails the Mind, and the Mind the
Deſire, and the Deſire the Satisfaction, and all the Man. There is indeed
nothing more in all theſe Pleaſures, beſides bare Imagination and
Expectation, which tho' they may draw out the Affections, do never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
them, nay, do the more diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and diſappoint them, and Pleaſure
is but an Earneſt laid down for Grief, if not for Ruin.</p>
            <p>This Adventure hath no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and if this be a Man's End,
'tis an End that quickly ends both it ſelf and him: Many have come to their
End by it, never any enjoy'd their End in it. <hi>Alexander</hi> was a greater
Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in overcoming his own Deſire of ſeeing <hi>Darius</hi> his Wife
and Daughters, than in ſubduing them, <hi>Victor Magis Darii uxorem, non
videndo quam Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium vincendo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next Place, we ſhall ſee ſome Men rake Riches together,
as Children <pb n="353" facs="tcp:0544000400:392"/> do Snow, rowling it up with no little Pains
and Hazards of their Health, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaps, and then faſhioning them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Horſes, Giants and Caſtles, and the next Shower waſhes them away, and
leaves nothing in the Place but Dirt. It was well ſaid of
<hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> that great General, to a common Soldier, <hi>Thou who
art not</hi> Themiſtocles, <hi>take this Traſh to thee,</hi> meaning the
Jewels and the rich <hi>Perſian</hi> Spoils after a Victory. Wealth certainly
is one of the greateſt Bankrupts in the World, and does not ſatisfie the
Debt it promiſes; for a Man may as ſoon fill a Quart Pot with Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as a
rational Mind with Wealth; there muſt be a Proportion between the Ingredient
and the Capacity. We call that Well, or Brain, empty, that hath not Water or
Wit; tho' the firſt be full of Air, the other of Vapour, they are ſtill
empty of what ſhould fill them, and ſo will the Heart of Man be, tho' never
ſo full of Wealth, and much of it doth but let us ſee, how much more of it
we want. The World is not ſo unequally dealt, as we talk, the Rich want a
Stomach oftner than the Poor do Meat: If the Poor Man's Hunger and Labour be
more, his Meat and Sleep are ſweeter, and what Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſes 
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0544000400:393"/> are theſe, that are as well not received as enjoyed,
as well wanted as had; the Will would certainly never be ſatisfy'd, if it had
all it deſired, but one is preſently ſatisfy'd if he renounces it; in
complying with the Will we ſhall never be at quiet, not complying with it, we
ſhall always be at reſt. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> have beſt
known the Happineſs and Miſery of Man, and have the beſt deſcribed it,
one of them the happieſt, and the other the moſt wretched of Men; the one
knew the Vanity of all Pleaſure, the other the Reality of all Evils, by
Experience.</p>
            <p>Pleaſure, inſtead of ſatisfying, doth ſatiate, but Riches
doth neither. For my own Part, my Humour does not much depend upon theſe
Things. I have always fair and ſoul Weather with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my ſelf, good or ill
Succeſs in my Affairs does not much move me, I ſometimes ſet my ſelf
againſt ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the Glory of overcoming it makes me maſter it
with Pleaſure; whereas at other Times I am very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and as it were
diſſatisfy'd, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with Proſperity, looking upon Worldly Glory but as a
Fancy: If we fiſh for it, we ſhall find it nothing, an Apparition, like the
Night Mare in a <pb n="355" facs="tcp:0544000400:394"/> Dream, you imagine it a Subſtance, you
graſp at it, you awake and it is nothing. Pleaſure yet and Wealth will
abide a Senſe or two; but this of Glory can neither be felt, ſeen or
underſtood; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Slipperineſs of it ſhould make us undervalue
it. (Let us remember the Conſul <hi>Bibulus</hi> in his triumphant Chariot by
the Fall of a Tile-Stone from a Houſe made a Sacrifice, before he could reach
the Capitol, to offer up the Bulls and Garlands he had prepared; or in that
prodigious Favourite <hi>Sejanus,</hi> whom the ſame Day ſaw attended by
the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and torn in Pieces by the People; nay we need not go ſo far
back,) we need but think of the <hi>De Wits</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> who
govern'd abſolutely that Common Wealth, and were ſo torn in Pieces by the
People in the Morning, that there ſcarce remained ere Night ſo much as a
Mammeck of Fleſh. It hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome, but it hath ruin'd more; and
thoſe whom it hath moſt raiſed, it hath much ruin'd. <hi>Paucos beavit
ſed &amp; plures perdidit, &amp; quos heavit perdidit.</hi> Certainly if
there be any thing glorious in this World, 'tis a Mind that contemns that
Glory. <hi>Diogenes</hi> had more of it by his Contempt than <hi>Alexander</hi>

for then their Minds, by their Parent's Skill, no leſs than their Bodies, by
the Midwife's Hand, may with Eaſe be moulded into ſuch a Faſhion as will
be durable in After-Ages. The Seeds of Virtue ſhould be ſo early Ingrafted
into them, that they ſhould not know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature or Precepts were the
Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them. Many Parents do endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unſeaſonably to ſow
Wiſdom in them, which does but corrupt their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not yet ripe for
ſuch Inſtructions; they ſhould rather let them enjoy that Freedom which
Nature in Pity hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on them, and not force them to endure the
Puniſhment of human Cares before they have deſerv'd them; let harmleſs
Wantonneſs be freely allow'd <pb n="360" facs="tcp:0544000400:399"/> them, and let them rather
fear, than feel the Correction of their Parents. To Colts and young Cattle we
freely allow an uncontrolled Freedom, leaſt their firſt Strength (which is
then grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) ſhould be hindred; and yet we are ſo blind in what we behold
in other Creatures, we either neglect, or will not underſtand in our own
Children, who after they have fulfill'd the Folly of their firſt Years, Age
does by little and little change their Deſires, and the Roots of Virtue will
ſpring up in them; and therefore ſuch as will call the raw Minds of
Children to too haſty a Ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Studies, are very Ignorant of the
Strength which Nature beſtow'd on that Age: Some Children indeed have early
Wits; as <hi>Papyrius</hi>'s Childhood that was judged worthy of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Senate. The Humours of Children are very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; ſome ſeem
to be made of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mould than others. There are often ſeen Preſages of
future Abilities in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; as in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who firſt founded the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, who was bred up and believed to be a Shepherd's
Child, till after a more ſtrict Inquiry, he was found to be the Grand-child
of <hi>Aſtyages</hi>; and <hi>Cato,</hi> in his Infancy, was more than a
Child; but this is very uncertain, and <pb n="361" facs="tcp:0544000400:400"/> they are often
deceiv'd, who by the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of Children will judge too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily of their
future Diſpoſition; for it muſt be ſome great ſign and firmly
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant above the Levity of that Age, which muſt be brought as an
effectual Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to judge of the Inclination of their future and flexible
Years. Tho' ſome Children are more governable, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier gain'd by gentle
Uſage, yet their Manners are generally according to their Education; the
neglect of Diſcipline, and the force of Example, makes the Difference, and
cauſes Children to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed or miſcarry; but thoſe who are naturally
moſt inclin'd to Ill are in moſt Danger; and ſince Education is the chief
Reaſon of their firſt Principles, great Care muſt be taken to ſet the
Byaſs right at firſt, and that Virtue may be early in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd into their
Minds, which will make their Lives happy for the future, and then Cuſtom will
make it eaſie to them: And indeed, Children ſhould be treated with great
Warineſs; they ſhould hear and ſee nothing that ſhould be dangerous in
the Imitation, and the Indiſcretion of Parents is very often of ill
Conſequence in this Particular; which puts me in mind of what
<hi>Montaign</hi> ſays to this Purpoſe; who being preſent whilſt the
Governante <pb n="362" facs="tcp:0544000400:401"/> was hearing his Daughter read, and there

was very angry with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante, and ſaid, <hi>She had done his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much hurt in taking Notice of that Word, which ſhe ſhould have let paſs
without any Obſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Childhood is certainly the principal Time for Improvement, whilſt
the Mind is at liberty, the Memory ſtrong, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures unknown to them; and
they are like white Paper, where you may Write what you pleaſe; and we
ſhould never deſign Children to any Profeſſion before their Capacities
are known, and their Genius and Inclinations examin'd; for otherwiſe their
Nature may be croſſed, and to ſtrive againſt the Stream is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in vain; and if Care were taken that the Inclinations of young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were
ſuited to their Profeſſions, we ſhould ſee them improve much faſter
than they do; for Men muſt not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to fly without Wings, and to
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake Buſineſs that is too hard for them: The Paſſions of young
Men often carry them with full Speed, when they want the Bridle and not the
Spur; and like a Ship without a Pilot, they often over-ſet themſelves,
being launched with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <pb n="363" facs="tcp:0544000400:402"/> Ballaſt, and wanting a
Compaſs to Steer by, they are ſoon under Water: And indeed, Youth without
good Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in a dangerous Condition, and ſoon loſt, being ſubject
to great Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore thoſe that are Young ſhould be very
careful of their Carriage, ſince we ſee oftentimes thoſe that are very
promiſing in their Youth, flag at the laſt, and fall ſhort of
Expectation.</p>
            <p>Young Men, at their firſt Entrance into Man's Eſtate, the Heat
of Blood breeds in them a wonderful Change, carries away their Mind with a Tide
of inconſiderate Confidence and vain Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, they know not how to be
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident for After-times, neither can they conſider how obnoxious they are
to the Ruins of Fortune.</p>
            <p>The Office of Childhood is to Learn, and retain by a ſtrong
Memory, the Deeds and Speeches of their Anceſtors; of Youth, to invent and
ſpeak Things altogether new; of middle Age, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate it ſelf by
Obſervation from both the former, for then our Bodies and Minds are
exceedingly changed from what they were heretofore; and as we grow in Years,
our Pleaſures and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are not the ſame, even our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and
all our Deſires, are much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, <pb n="364" facs="tcp:0544000400:403"/> and moulded as
it were a-new. No Age of Man is more cunning than the middle Age, in
diſſembling Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and governing their Affections. It can then
wonder at it ſelf, that it could ſo improvidently go aſtray, and
endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to repair the Ruins of his younger Years, and renews with much
Vigour the Errors of the ſame. Memory is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver greateſt in Children, being
then able to retain what they learn, and ſtill ſafely ſtore it up in the
Cloſets of their Memory; but as Age increaſes it will decay, and therefore
their Minds ought to be fill'd with profitable Hiſtory whilſt they are
young; for Memory is like the Dew, which in hot Countries falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the
Leaves of Holly, unleſs it be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd by break of Day, it vaniſhes at Sun
Riſing. Things of little Labour and no Judgement, will eaſily be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by Children, who are neither ſtrong for Labour, nor ripe for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Publick Miniſters, when they have a Mind to prolong their Families
in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſhould always breed at leaſt one of their Children in their

conſiderable; but the Biſhop told him, that if he wanted Mony to mend his
Plow or Cart, or to buy a new one; of if he wanted Tackling for his Horſes,
or any other Things belonging to his Husbandry, he ſhou'd not want what was
fitting, but he wiſhed him to aim no higher, for Husbandman he found him, and
a Husbandman he would leave him; and to ſhew the Force of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and
that the learnedſt Men are not always the wiſeſt, there goes a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Story of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> being both
invited to Dinner by the <hi>French</hi> King, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to obſerve their
Humours, being brought into the Room where the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was cover'd and made
ready, the firſt fell to eating of Bread as faſt as he could, and at laſt
breaking out of a brown Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he cry'd out <hi>Concafum eſt contra

an earthly Queen be ſo beautiful, what ſhall we think of the Queen of

may infer, That the learnedſt Men are not always the civilleſt and beſt
moral Men. And there is too great a Number of them, who lead a ſoft

               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:0544000400:408"/>Religion and Juſtice are the two Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters
of every Commonwealth, they are the Pillars of all Government, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them
the whole State, Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, will like a melted Veſſel
run into Confuſion and Diſorder. The Law of a Nation is the Soul of a
Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; 'tis the Rudder, by which the Veſſel of the Common-wealth is
ſteer'd, 'tis the Yoke wherewith All are kept in Obedience; and that
Common-Wealth, where Men, and not Laws govern, will be quickly like the Field
of the Sluggard, all grown over with Thorns and Nettles; and therefore there
had need be Weeders, that is, good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, to keep the Field of a
Common-Wealth, from being overſpread with Thorns and Nettles, that is,
diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lewd Perſons, and they had need be good Laws that muſt keep
in ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Beaſts, the Diſturbers of the Peace. To what Purpoſe do
Laws enjoin Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, if they are not put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. For Laws muſt
not be like Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs, to catch only ſmall Flies and to be broken by great
Ones; it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not to make any, for this makes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Man's
Offence the Sin of the Publick, <hi>quis non vetat peccare cum poteſt,
jubet,</hi> to omit the Puniſhment <pb n="370" facs="tcp:0544000400:409"/> of an Offence under
our Charge is to commit it. The due Obſervation of the Laws of God, and the
careful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Laws of Men, make a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion flouriſh. They are
indeed the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Spirit and Sinews of every State, for all Humane Laws have
their Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Laws of God, who is the Great Law-Giver, and the
nearer our Copies draw to that Original, the better they are, and the more like
to continue: <hi>In peſſimâ republicâ leges plurimae.</hi> And
therefore the Curſe of the Prophet hath been expounded by the Multitude of
penal Laws, which are worſe than Showers of Hail and Tempeſt upon the
Cattle, for they fall upon Men; and where Religion and Laws are not
preſerved, we can't pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call them Common-Wealths, but <hi>magna
latrocinia,</hi> great Confederacies of Thieves; if Religion be not upheld, if
the Laws be not obſerved, if Vice goes unpuniſhed, and Virtue unrewarded,
if a due Reſpect be not given to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, who are the living Stamps of
the ſupreme Authority, all our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Contentment in this Life and
the next will be taken away, and the whole Frame of Government will fall 
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0544000400:410"/> to the Ground and diſſolve. The Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Earth
belong unto God, and from hence we ſhould learn our Duty of Honour, Reverence
and Loyalty. They were the Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
<hi>Saul.</hi> Without Governours or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, one Man will be Bread for
another; and we ſhould be as the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes in the Sea, the Great would
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Small. It is no particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, but a great Truth, that all
Duties are by ſo much the better performed, by how much the Men are more
reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious from whoſe Abilities the ſame proceed. But if Magiſtrates, who
are employed about the Publick Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice, follow it only
as a Trade for Gains ſake, the Formalities of it will only then ſerve to
ſmother Right, and what was neceſſarily ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the common Good,
will thro' the Abuſe of it be the Cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Miſery. The Laws
without Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, is putting Arrows into a Quiver from whence they are not
drawn out, this is to make the Magiſtrate an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Statue, a
<hi>George</hi> on Horſe-Back, ſeeming always ready, but never ſtrikes.
The Law without Execution is a <hi>Chimera,</hi> which only ſerves to
fright.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:0544000400:411"/>Juſtice and Fortune are painted blind, to
ſhew us what the one ſhould do, and what the other ſhould not do; for the
one gives without Reſpect, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in no Reſpect to take; for
none ſhould execute the Office of Juſtice, but ſuch whoſe Eyes are
blind from reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons, and whoſe Hands are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from
accepting Rewards. The <hi>Thebans</hi> painted their Judges and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
without Hands, ſince when their Hands are over long, 'tis to be feared their
Feet will become Gouty, their Tongue ty'd, their Ears deafened, and their Eyes
dimmed. It is a Shame and Reproach to us to ſee <hi>Pagans</hi> that have
ſhewed greater Integrity, and more Uncorruption and Affection to the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Good, than we do. <hi>Civillians</hi> ſay, the Magiſtrate is the living
Law, and that his good Example ſhould be a lively and perpetual Promulgation
of that Law; for Example prevails much more than Precept, and reduces more
under its Yoke, tho' naked, than the Law with all its Enforcements; and the
Reaſon is obvious, for the Arms of Law only ſtrike the Body, but the Shafts
of Example ſtrike into the Soul, and we ſee Men daily truſt more to their
Eyes than to their Ears, more to <pb n="373" facs="tcp:0544000400:412"/> what they ſee than to
what they hear, <hi>Facilius eſt errare Naturam quam Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipem

frame an Age unlike themſelves. Under <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus Rome</hi> was warlike;

<hi>Antonies</hi> intemperate and diſſolute; under <hi>Julian</hi>
Idolatrous; under <hi>Valens Arrian</hi>; and the Example of King
<hi>Jeroboam</hi> caus'd all the People to commit Idolatry; whereas under the
Reign of King <hi>David, Ezekias,</hi> and <hi>Joſias</hi> Religion and Piety
were ſeen to flouriſh. For People generally are like Clay without Form in
themſelves, but eaſily wrought by the Potter's Hand. They behold moſt
Affairs with the Eyes of their Magiſtrates, and ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
eaſily to be directed by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and to diſlike whatever they
reject.</p>
            <p>An ancient Father hath ſaid, <hi>He that is not a good Husband,
cannot be a good Magiſtrate,</hi> for he that rules not his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily well,
cannot govern others, which is a rational Deduction; but he that is not an
honeſt Man cannot be a good Magiſtrate; for he that will make Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of
his own Reputation, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <pb n="374" facs="tcp:0544000400:413"/> take Care of the
Common-Wealth. The Juſtice every Man owes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, does oblige him
firſt to regulate his own Affections and Paſſions, and then he will be
more capable to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Juſtice to others, for both natural and divine Laws,
do propoſe our ſelves for a Rule and Meaſure of what we owe to our
Neighbours. Magiſtrates are to give good Examples to others, owing it
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ordering their own Lives, and they owe to it the Publick for
Imitation. The juſt and good Man is a Rule and Meaſure of all others,
ſince being what all Men ought to be, he ſhews what all Men ought to do.
Integrity is ſo neceſſary in a Magiſtrate, that without it all other
Qualities are but Inſtruments of particular Profit, and Publick Loſs. All
the <hi>Grecian</hi> Common-Wealths fell to Ruin for want of this. Gold breeds
the Scurvy in ſome Mens Mouths, and Ambition breeds Impoſthumes in ſome
Mens Hearts. He muſt not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on private Intereſt but the Publick, and
ſubmit his particular Affairs to the Intereſt of the whole: <hi>Virtutis

and have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſum'd in this following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to ſhew
ſome Advantages of Old Age, of which I am at preſent a living Teſtimony,
even in this Year 1706.</p>
            <p>The Life of Man is uſually divided into Childhood, Youth, Man's
Eſtate, and Old Age, all which Degrees we bring into that narrow Compaſs,
whilſt our Life conſumes inſenſibly. Infancy is only a State of Hope,
and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſupported by the indulgent Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Parents and
Nurſes. Youth, if well Educated, will ſoon bloſſom, and after yield
Fruit. Man's Eſtate, like a Flame, well kindled and ſupply'd will burn
long, but Old Age does uſually ſoon paſs away; and if we do not watch, we
loſe our Opportunities; if we do not make haſte we are left behind, our
beſt Hours fly from us, the worſt are to come; the pureſt Part of our
Life runs firſt, and leaves only the Dregs at the Bottom, unleſs we take
great Care, and then our Strength and Deſires will fall off together, and our
Years will ſit eaſie upon us, when we're thus ſatisfy'd and compos'd; it
ſmooths our Paſſage <pb n="378" facs="tcp:0544000400:417"/> to the other World, and makes
us ſlide into the Grave with a more gentle and inſenſible Motion. Indeed
if we could obſerve the State of our Infancy, when we came firſt into the
World, with the Progreſs of our Growth, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our Reaſon,
it would certainly be a pleaſant Retroſpection, but divine Providence hath
hid this from our Sight. At our Birth neither our Limbs nor Underſtanding
were born at their full Growth, but we encreaſe by Degrees, and being Infants
in our Bodies, we are not Men in our Souls: The firſt ten Years we may call
an Animal Life, the Powers of Reaſon are then feeble in us, and we do but
ſleep that Time away, but afterwards the Advances of Age are very gradual;
but yet this Gradation is ſo ſlow, that we cannot take much No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it,
nor ſee it with our Eyes, and ſo we think all goes well, ſince we are not
thrown ſo ſuddenly out of our Youth into our Manhood, and from that into
Old Age, which would be much more ſenſible to us, and concerns us more: But
we walk gently up Hill from our Youth to our middle State, and as gently down
the Hill from our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood into Old Age, without perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0544000400:418"/> the Change we have made 'till we come at the Bottom:
However we muſt needs be troubled, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the greateſt Part of
Life is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a ſlow Conſumption, and that at laſt we muſt
fall into a State of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and be unacceptable both to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and to
our ſelves: But we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom think of this, becauſe we ſeem to be the
ſame Men in the Morning, as we were the Night before. Now he that would have
his Health hold out to the laſt, and grow old with Advantage, muſt be
regular in his Youth, and not live too faſt: We muſt husband our
Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not throw it away 'till we have done living, for our Vices
deſtroy our Lives as well as our Fortunes; Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance antidates our
Infirmities, and makes us die much ſooner than we ſhould; and tho' we have
the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, we do not play the good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band early enough; for 'tis
too late to ſpare at the Bottom, when all is drawn out to the Lees. 'Tis
true, we old Men cannot but be ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, to think that we grow
leſs and leſs every Day, doing the ſame things over again; and that we
live only to nurſe up our Decays, which is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome 
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0544000400:419"/> to us, eſpecially ſince there is nothing in this
World to make us in love with it, or fond of it; none yet were ever fully
pleas'd with it; for tho' it ſeems a <hi>Juno</hi> in the Purſuit, 'tis but
a Cloud in our Embraces; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who are ſorry to ſee their
Voyage fixed, are over-fond of their native Country, and hang about Life a
little too meanly. Indeed when our Senſes droop, and all the Faculties of our
Souls and Bodies decay apace, it is then high time to bid adieu to the active
Life, and not only to abandon the Vanities of this fading World, but the very
Remembrance and Thoughts of them: Our Minds begin then to be nauſeated with
the Ideas of our paſt Folly, which we falſly call'd Pleaſure; and that
Retroſpect is unpleaſant, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon a Life to be repented of.
It is but Reaſon when we approach near the Grave, when all our Senſes put
us daily in Mind of our Mortality, that we ſhould begin to recollect our
ſelves, and think whereabouts we are, that we may not be ſurpriz'd, and die
leſs than our ſelves. It ſhould be our Care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we grow old to live
well, and then we may be ſure to die well. It is the <pb n="381" facs="tcp:0544000400:420"/>
Duty of Life to prepare our ſelves for Death; there is not one Hour we live,
that does not mind us of our Mortality. Time runs on, the Period is certain,
tho' it lyes in the Dark, our Term is ſet, and none of us know how near it
is, and therefore we ſhould not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to have that befall us to Day, which
might have happened to us any Minute ſince we were born. This
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhould make us live as if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Minute were our laſt. But
we fear Death, only becauſe we know not where we ſhall go, and we never
begin to reform 'till our old Age, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpent our former Years in
all Sorts of Vanity (which is better late than never) but 'tis a miſerable
Caſe, not to know the Value of a Treaſure, 'till we are going to loſe it.
To begin our Frugality, when we are ready to turn Bankrupts: We ſhould
therefore begin early to do that which will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pleaſe, and young Men
ſhould carefully avoid throwing away their Time, as if they came into the
World for no other End but to eat and ſleep, or elſe to ſpend their Days
in Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and Folly, and to make Vice <pb n="382" facs="tcp:0544000400:421"/> their
Buſineſs. Thus we ſee in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that Age grows worſe upon the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and hath no Relief to expect but the Grave; yet in ſome, Health,
Vigour and Senſe, hold out to the laſt. Many of the ancient Philoſophers
and <hi>Romans</hi> were Examples of this Truth. <hi>Tully,</hi> who wrote
excellently well <hi>de Senectute</hi> was a lively Example hereof, being
paſt Sixty when he wrote his <hi>Philippicks,</hi> in which his Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick is
more correct and moving than in his younger Orations. The Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Fire, which
is uſually ſooneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct in Men, I have found by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in my
ſelf, hath laſted much beyond that Period, of which I could give modern
Proof, but I will leave that to my Son; only this I can with Truth affirm, that
the Poems I have made ſince my Age of Seventy, have more of Force and Spirit,
than thoſe I had written ſome Years before; but this is a particular Grace
of God, it being very unuſual in the Generality, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard for Men to
ſeem young when they're old, and much more ſtrange to be ſo; for tho' at
ones Death, <hi>Fuimus</hi> may make a good Motto, yet in Life 'tis ſtark
naught.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:0544000400:422"/>None can imagine how green and vigorous ſome
Mens Minds are in Old Age, having a perpetual Conflict with their Bodies, who
were ill-match'd, unleſs to ſhew that an active Spirit may be lodged in a
decay'd Body. It is certainly a particular Happineſs to preſerve the Force
of the Mind in the Decay of the Body, to live to that Age, that neither cares
for any thing, nor ſtands in need of any thing; that tho' it can much longer,
yet it will not ſtill do the ſame Things over again, which it ought not to
do, Age ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put an End to his Deſires; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there can be no gentler
End, than thus to melt away in a kind of Diſſolution.</p>
            <p>Where Fire meets with Oppoſition and Matter to work upon, it is
furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and rages, but when it finds no Fuel, as in Old Age, it goes out
quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for want of Nouriſhment; nor is the Body the ſettled Habitation of
the Soul, but a temporary Lodging, which we muſt leave whenever the Maſter
of the Houſe pleaſes. 'Tis true, every Man hath naturally a Love for his
own Body, as poor People love even their own beggarly Cottages: They are 
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0544000400:423"/> old Acquaintances, and loath to part; yet old Men, tho'
they may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what indulge their Bodies, yet they make not themſelves
Slaves to them, nor care any more what becomes of their Carkaſſes, when
dead, than a Man does for the ſhaving of his Beard under the Hand of a
Barber. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Age it ſelf is not without its Pleaſures, if we knew
rightly how to uſe them (the beſt Morſel being ſtill reſerved for the
laſt) or almoſt it is equivalent to the enjoying of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, not to
ſtand in need of them. Time indeed goes faſter with old Men than young,
becauſe they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon moſt upon it. There is hardly any Man ſo old but he
may hope for one Day more yet, and the longeſt Life is but a Multiplication
of Days, nay Hours and Moments, for the End of our Lives is ſet, and the
firſt Breath we draw, is but the firſt Step to our laſt, the Courſe of
all Things in this World being only a long Connection of Providential
Appointments; and tho' there be great Variety in our Lives, yet all tend to the
ſame Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. Death old Men find moſt eaſie, becauſe it is comply'd
with without <pb n="385" facs="tcp:0544000400:424"/> ſtrugling; for by dying of old Age, a Man
does no more than go to Bed when he is weary, it being childiſh to go out of
the World as we came into it, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and crying. For theſe and many other
Reaſons, I cannot agree with them that ſeem to impute much Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to long Life, and that length of Days does much rather impair than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove us;
for if we follow the Courſe of Nature and of Reaſon, old Age is a mighty
Bleſſing, were it only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it gives Time leave to vent and boil
away the Unquietneſs and Turbulency that follow our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in our
younger Years, and weans us gently from carnal Affections, and at laſt to
drop with Eaſe and Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, like ripe Fruit from the Tree; for when
before the Seaſon Fruit is pull'd off with violent Hands, or ſhaken down by
rude and boiſterous Winds, it hath an indigeſted raw taſte of the Wood,
and hath an unpleaſant Eagerneſs in its Juice, that makes it unfit for
Uſe till length of time hath mellowed it; ſo Souls that go out of their
Bodies with Affection to thoſe Objects they leave behind (which uſually is
as long as they can reliſh them) do retain ſtill, as ſome 
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0544000400:425"/> think, even to their Separation, a By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſs and
Languiſhing toward them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we muſt conſider that old Age is not
always a Burthen and Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, there are ſeveral peculiar Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
annexed to this part of Life which will relieve us under the Decays of the
Body; for the Imperfections of old Age are not ſo unavoidable as grey Hairs.
The quiet Compoſure of an old Man's Mind, keeps him from wearing out ſo
faſt, it props up his Strength, and makes him live cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the laſt
Moment; for eaſie Thoughts are excellent Opiates, which will not only
mitigate old Men's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, but make them almoſt to deſpiſe their
Miſery. Thus moſt Men take Care to live long, but few take Care to live
well, which is in every Man's Power to do, but in no Man's Power to do the
former.</p>
            <p>We conſume our Lives in providing the very Inſtruments of Life,
ſo that we do not properly live but we are about to live, and we only
propound to begin to live at our old Age, to which very few People arrive.</p>
            <p>There are other very remarkable Advantages of old Age; for thoſe 
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0544000400:426"/> who have had the longeſt Time to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves
muſt needs be the wiſeſt Men; ſuch have ſeen greater Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of
Events, have had more Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of obſerving Humours and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts:
Their Judgments are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, they know more things and thoſe better than
young Men, bringing their Thoughts to a ſecond Teſt, for trying what they
took upon Truſt in their Youth. Old Men are uſually free from violent
Paſſions; matters of Moment are better conſider'd by them; whereas
younger Perſons are apt to judge amiſs, their Proſpect being too ſhort;
and certainly Age is the time in which the Mind is moſt diſcerning, and
furniſht with the beſt Materials for Wiſdom: Thoſe who have been
longeſt in publick Employments, whoſe Performances have been more than
ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, who have done moſt Service for their King and Country, deſerve
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a more particular Reſpect, and ſhould be conſidered with more
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, and ſhould have the faireſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, and treated with
the beſt Civility, like parting Friends that are ready to take leave of the
World; but, alas! this ſeldom happens, for old <pb n="388" facs="tcp:0544000400:427"/>
Services are uſually forgotten, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in an Age where young Men ſee
Viſions, and old Men Dream, their former Actions and repeated good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
being no more taken notice of, than if they had never been, tho' even Decency
and Good-Nature ſhould at leaſt make them be reſpected for them.</p>
            <p>Thus the State of Mortals in this Life is very changeable; if we are
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to caſt Anchor awhile in ſome calm, ſerene Seaſon, if we are
permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Careen and Recruit our Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beaten Spirits, enjoying ſome
ſhort interval of Reſt and Eaſe, the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſoon expires, and we
are forced to hoiſt Sail with double Diligence, leaſt we ſuffer a Wreck,
for we fly at Random in a Sea of perpetual Hazards and Difficulties; and yet
the ſhortneſs of Life is the common Complaint of moſt People, who make it
ſhort either by doing ill, doing nothing, or doing Things beſides their
Buſineſs; ſo that this large extent of Life will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps amount to
the Minority of Man; ſo that it may be a long Being, perhaps a ſhort Life;
for it is not the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Years that makes Death eaſie to 
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0544000400:428"/> us, but the Temper of the Mind; he that would live a
little longer this Day, would be as loth to Die a thouſand Years hence: Go we
muſt at laſt, no matter how ſoon: 'Tis the Work of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to make
us live long, but 'tis own Buſineſs to make a ſhort Life ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
Life is to be meaſur'd by our Actions, not by Time. A Man may die old at
Thirty, and young at Eighty, the one lives after Death, the other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
before he died. And therefore that Noble General <hi>Similis,</hi> who lived to
a great Age, and retired from Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Devotion Seven Years before
his Death, would have only this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph in Subſtance engrav'd upon his
Tomb-ſtone: <hi>Here lies</hi> Similis <hi>of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Age, and yet
lived only Seven Years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Old Age is the Effect of Providence: How long I ſhall live is only
in God's Power, but it's in my Power how well. How great a ſhame is it then
to be lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new Foundations of Life at our laſt Gaſp? for an old Man,
with one Foot in the Grave, to go to School again? While we are young we may
learn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Minds are then tractable, and our Bodies fit for Labour;
but <pb n="390" facs="tcp:0544000400:429"/> when old Age comes on, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſeiz'd
with Sloath and afflicted with Diſeaſes, and at laſt we leave the World
as Ignorant as we came into it; only we die worſe than we were born, which is
our own Fault. I wiſh with all my Soul that I had thought better and ſooner
of my End; but I muſt now make the more haſte, and being in good Health, I
muſt Spur on, like thoſe that ſet out late upon a Journey: It is better
to learn late, than not at all, altho' it be only to inſtruct me how I may
leave the Stage of this World, with a perfect Reſignation, with a true
Senſe of the Sins of my fore-paſſed Life, with a true Fear of God, and a
ſure Truſt in his Mercy; and thus I ſhall ſink with Eaſe into my
Grave, and tho' I die old, I ſhall riſe young in the other World, for that
State is an eternal Spring, ever flouriſhing, and ſhall gently paſs from
one Extream to another.</p>
