            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <byline>BY MR. ARBUTHNOT.</byline>
            <p>IF it is required to eſtabliſh a plantation of Madder, to which plants muſt be brought from a foreign country, they muſt be winter plants, which are pieces of the main root on which are many buds; theſe are to be had in the latter end of autumn or ſpring, when the crop is taken up. The beſt method is to pack them in ſand, as the buds will ſhoot; the ground ſhould be extremely rich, a ſandy loom, and perfectly clean; furrows ſhould be made about a foot aſunder and about four inches deep; ſtrew the pieces of root and any of the yellow ſhoots, that are broken off, juſt ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0990400400:4"/>
to cover the bottom, and earth them. In the month of April there will appear numberleſs ſhoots, which ſhould be kept very clean, and a little fine mould thrown over them to lengthen the ſtem, which are the ſpring plants; when the ſhoots are about ſix or eight inches above ground, they are fit to draw, but care muſt be taken to pull them up with as long a ſtem as poſſible, as that becomes the principal part of the crop; the earth muſt be looſened by an old trowel or any ſuch like inſtrument to facilitate the drawing of the plants, but it muſt be done with care, as in a few days time there will be a freſh ſucceſſion of plants like aſparagus. The above are merely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the nurſery, which may be dug up for crop when all the plants are obtained; for the repeated pulling will ſo weaken the roots, as to render them not worth ſtanding for crop; for want of this precaution many people injure their crop by drawing plants from it, inſtead of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſmall patch as above deſcribed for a nurſery. It muſt likewiſe be obſerved, that you will obtain the longeſt and beſt plants from the firſt year's growth, as the original plant or mother root is much deeper, than the crowns of the plants will be by earthing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0990400400:5"/>
The land for the crop ſhould be as for the nurſery a rich mellow loam, either hazle, or black; it cannot be too rich, and muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly clean; it muſt be ploughed as deep as the good ſoil will admit of the preceding year of planting. Soil, that will not admit of ploughing eighteen inches deep at leaſt, is not fit for madder. It muſt be laid up in high four feet lands before winter, that it may be ſufficiently dry for working in the ſpring; for unleſs the land is in exceeding good tilth when you plant, it is in vain to attempt it.</p>
            <p>The land ſhould therefore have one good ploughing in the ſpring, partly to deſtroy any weeds, which may have grown during the winter, as likewiſe to enliven the ſoil, but it muſt be when the land is perfectly dry; as ſoon as your plants are ready, which will be in April, ſlit down two furrows one foot aſunder from the crown of the land as thus;
<figure/>
then lay the plants againſt the ſides of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows about ſix inches aſunder, with their heads
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0990400400:6"/>
leaning to each other; this operation may be performed by women and children, who are followed by men, who with hoes cover the plants with the mould, that was thrown out by the plough; when this is done, the lands will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear thus,
<figure/>
the plants lying as deſcribed. Unleſs it is rainy weather when your plants are drawn, they ſhould be dipped in water the moment they are pulled, and kept quite wet till plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, if the land is dry, it will be requiſite to give a good watering the evening of the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for, as the plants are extremely ſucculent, in that proportion they dry up the faſter, and will ſhrink to the ſize of a ſtraw. If the plants do not ſtrike immediately, they are not worth ſtanding; they are in the greateſt perfection for pulling, when ſmall fibres begin to puſh all around them. As ſoon as you perceive, that the plants have ſtruck vigorouſly, hoe the ground well round and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, ſo as to looſen the ſoil well, and make it perfectly pervious to the young fibres; as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0990400400:7"/>
it is the vigour of the firſt year's growth, which is to ſecure you a plentiful crop. After this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you are only to take care, that no weeds grow during the ſummer, which muſt be by hand weeding, and ſuperficial hoeing; for the roots, which are the crop, muſt be carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from injury; therefore great care muſt be taken to watch and deſtroy moles, which always frequent rich land in ſearch of worms, which they feed on. When weeding and hoeing the crop, draw a little light mould from the ſides of the land to nouriſh the crowns as much as poſſible. In autumn, when the haulm dies, cover the whole over three inches deep, to preſerve the crowns of the plants from froſt, and the haulm rotting in the ground is beneficial, and keeps the ground looſe; this earthing muſt be done from the intervals, which conſequently ſhould be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally worked with a light plough or horſe hoe during the ſummer. Open the water furrows well againſt winter, that no water may lie. As early in the ſpring as the weather will permit, the whole plantation ſhould be carefully weeded over, but great attention muſt be paid to the not deſtroying of the buds, which will be near the ſurface waiting for warm weather to puſh. Such
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0990400400:8"/>
land as I deſcribe, being made rich, will be very ſubject to chickweed, and if it is not checked in time, it will greatly ſmother the crop and exhauſt the moiſture from the ſurface of the ſoil. The remainder of the ſecond year's practice ſhould be as the firſt, reſpecting hand weeding and ſlight ſuperficial hoeing, and earthing on the haulm in autumn; indeed the more you can earth the plants in the time of growing the better, as it will produce a greater quantity of roots; but each year, you muſt be more careful in not diſturbing the ſides of the lands, as the ſhoots will run like aſparagus; thus at laſt you have only a deep furrow between the lands. Some people take up the crop the ſecond year, but I prefer three years growth: the great expence being the preparing the land, planting, and taking up the crop, I have ever found the third year pay largely for the rent and tithes; the labour of hoeing is the leaſt, and not neceſſary to be ſo very minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended to, though large weeds muſt not be ſuffered to grow. The Dutch take it up at two years old, which from their mode of planting is right; they plant very thick on beds, from which circumſtance their plants cannot come to any ſize. But I diſapprove of that method, as it is the interior part of the roots, which produces the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0990400400:9"/>
valuable madder, conſequently the larger the root, the greater is the proportion of the beſt quality. I have traced the age of ſome Turkey roots to fifteen years old; they were become a ſolid wood all of the beſt quality, theſe muſt have grown wild.</p>
            <p>The general practice of taking up the crop is by the ſpade. I did it with a large plough, which ſtruck a clean furrow of above twenty inches deep; men, women, and boys followed the plough, and threw out the roots. The dirt ſhould be ſhook out of them as much as poſſible, then carry them every day out of the field to be dried in the ſhade; when perfectly dry, moſt of the remainder of the dirt will ſhake out, firſt beating the roots to pieces with poles or flails. They muſt then be dried on a kiln: the one I built was of the annexed form,
<figure>

                  <p>A, Fire place. B, Flue, full of holes to let out the heat. C, Hair cloth on laths, to hold the madder roots. D, The ſtove arched over, in which is the kiln 30 feet long.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0990400400:10"/>
The madder muſt be frequently turned, and will be dry enough for grinding in twenty four hours. The firſt time, that it goes under the ſtones, requires but a few minutes; it muſt be ſifted and produces a very inferior ſpecies, which is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward coat or rind. The remainder is returned to the ſtones, and is kept there till the eye tells you that the interior part begins to grind, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers itſelf by the paleneſs of the colour. If you require the beſt ſort to be very fine, you continue this ſecond grinding a little longer, in ſhort till all the rind is pulled off; it muſt be then ſifted, and the remainder put again under the ſtones and ground till fine enough for uſe. Each ſort ſhould be caſked up ſeparately, and kept in a dry place where no moiſture can affect it; care ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be taken to preſs the madder well down in the caſks.</p>
            <p>There are various ſorts of madder differing greatly from each other both in appearance, and value. The ſort I prefer is the Turkey, being more vigorous, and of a darker green. It like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe produces abundance of ſeed, which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort does not; it puts out many vigorous and ſolid runners, whereas the runners of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0990400400:11"/>
ſpecies are hollow, and produce none of the beſt part of the madder, which is contained in the woody part of the root.</p>
            <p>My mills conſiſted of two vertical ſtones, that run on a bed ſtone, ſuch as they uſe for grinding gunpowder, dye woods &amp;c.</p>
