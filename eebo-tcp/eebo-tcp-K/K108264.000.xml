            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>Hear ye now, O houſe of David, is it a ſmall thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God alſo? Therefore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a ſign, Behold, a virgin ſhall conceive, and bear a ſon, and ſhall call his name Immanuel. Butter and honey ſhall he eat, that he may know to refuſe the evil, and chooſe the good. For before the child ſhall know to refuſe the evil, and chooſe the good, the land that thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her kings.</q>

doctrine <note n="*" place="bottom">See Critical Diſſertation on Iſaiah vii. 13, 14, 15, 16.</note>; viz. <q>That the prophet <hi>(in this text)</hi> had no reference to the Meſſiah <note n="†" place="bottom">Page 44.</note>.</q> That <q>the words of Iſaiah prove only that a young woman ſhould conceive and bring forth a ſon, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating any thing miraculous in her conception,</q> &amp;c. <note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 21.</note> That <q>from the moſt careful and impartial examination, the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>(here tranſlated a virgin)</hi> doth not appear to ſignify ſtrictly a virgin;</q> but that <q>it ſeems to mean a young woman in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, without ſpecifying particularly, whether ſhe is a virgin or not <note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 23.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This writer is not ſingular in his notions, for the authors of the Critical Review have publicly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed themſelves of the ſame opinion concerning this prophecy (ſee N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 136, fo. 349.)— <q>The moſt obvious and natural explication <hi>(ſay they)</hi> is this which Dr. W—ms <note n="§" place="bottom">The author of a Concordance to the Greek Teſtament.</note> has adopted,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I do not find that they have objected to a ſingle part of the Doctor's work; and therefore this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic declaration certainly makes them parties to the whole: nay, perhaps I may ſay with juſtice, that they are more concerned in publiſhing theſe notions to the world, even than the <hi>anonymous author</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for inſtead of giving a ſhort extracted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0189000900:6"/>
of the work as uſual, they ſeem to have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the whole, almoſt at length, ſcarcely omitting a ſingle circumſtance.</p>
            <p>Now I muſt acknowledge, in juſtice to Dr. W—ms, that I think he has ſet forth his hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis to all the advantage that it is capable of; nevertheleſs, he does not make it appear that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in any other place of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where it occurs, muſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> ſignify a young woman that was <hi>not</hi> a virgin; without which proof the common acceptation of the ſign pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by Iſaiah cannot with juſtice be rejected; eſpecially as a virgin did afterwards conceive, and bear a ſon; a miracle which never happened before or ſince the birth of Chriſt! therefore it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a ſign worthy of that great and wonderful event; and, from that time to this, has by all Chriſtians (except the author of the Critical Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and the authors of the Critical Review <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. W—ms has ſince informed me of <hi>one other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the ſame opinion concerning this paſſage; (viz. the author of <hi>"The Aſſembly's Confeſſion of Faith examined,"</hi> printed in 1651.) but at the ſame time he acknowledges that this authority was not known, even to himſelf, until <hi>"ſeveral months after the Diſſertation was publiſhed:"</hi> and he declares concerning his own ſentiments of the paſſage, that he apprehended them <hi>"altogether new,"</hi> when he wrote, <q>for <hi>(ſays he)</hi> I did not then know that any Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian writer had ſo explained it.</q>
               </note>)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0189000900:7"/>
been eſteemed the completion of the ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
            <p>Dr. W—ms obſerves that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> occurs only ſeven times in all; and therefore, I hope, it will not take up too much of my readers time, if I attempt to examine the context of theſe ſeveral places, in order to aſcertain the true ſenſe of the word.</p>
            <p>The text wherein the ſignification of this word is eſteemed the moſt doubtful, is in Prov. xxx. 19. where Solomon mentions four things that were too hard for him; in which number (according to the Engliſh tranſlation) he includes <q>the way of a man with a maid.</q>
The ſenſe of this paſſage is very different according to the Syriac verſion, wherein <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is rendered <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>in his youth,</hi> viz. the way of a man <hi>"in his youth,"</hi> and not <hi>"with a maid,"</hi> as in the Engliſh verſion. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Latin vulgate, as well as the old Latin verſion of St. Jerome, conform in ſome degree to the Syriac, though not intirely; for they conſtrue it <hi>in adoleſcentia</hi> (not in adoleſcentia <hi>ejus</hi>) which is ſufficiently clear without having recourſe to Dr. Kennicott's <note n="*" place="bottom">See his ſermon preached before the univerſity of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford in 1765.—Note 8, page 46.</note> expedient of ſuppoſing a corruption in the preſent Heb. text to enable him to read <q>in his youth;</q> as if it had been wrote originally <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0189000900:8"/>Nevertheleſs, it appears to me that the common Engliſh tranſlation of this paſſage is to be preferred, and that the word muſt here neceſſarily ſignify a <hi>maid</hi> or <hi>virgin:</hi> for the writer ſeems to allude to the ſecret artifices and allurements uſed by a man in order to ſeduce a virgin; ſuch <hi>artifices</hi> as are hinted at in Exodus xxii. 16. (—<q>And if a man <hi>entice</hi> a <hi>maid,</hi>
               </q> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) &amp;c.) therefore a word ſignifying merely a young woman, or one that was not eſteemed a virgin, would not have been ſo ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the context of either of theſe paſſages. The <hi>way</hi> of a harlot was too well-known in former days, (as well as the preſent) to be eſteemed a myſtery; and much leſs a myſtery to Solomon, who had <q>threeſcore queens, <hi>fourſcore concubines,</hi> and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins without number.</q> (See Canticles vi. 8.) But it is not at all unnatural to ſuppoſe that this eaſtern monarch, with all his wiſdom, might ſometimes be perplexed with doubts and jealouſies concerning the virtue and private conduct of ſome of thoſe females (as well virgins as others) with reſpect to other men: this, it ſeems, was by him eſteemed as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be traced as the way of a ſhip in the ſea, an eagle in the air, &amp;c. By the ſin of the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous woman (to which the preceding ſimilies allude as being equally uninveſtigable <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Such</hi> is the way of an adulterous woman; ſhe eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and ſaith, I have done no wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Prov. xxx. 20.</note>) Solomon repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0189000900:9"/>
the great difficulty of detecting the inconſtancy of any particular perſons in the two former claſſes; I mean his queens and concubines; and he would not find it leſs difficult (for ſome time at leaſt) to trace out the <hi>way</hi> (or behaviour) of private admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers towards the third claſs of his women, that were eſteemed <hi>virgins</hi> in the eyes of the world.</p>
            <p>In confirmation of this I muſt obſerve, that the ſtrictneſs of the law of Moſes rendered the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of ſecrecy abſolutely neceſſary to offenders in this way: for, if a man was found guilty of <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a virgin</hi> (ſee Exodus xxii. 16.) he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not only to pay a heavy fine to the young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's father, and to take her for his wife, but was likewiſe deprived of an indulgence, which, of all others, ſeemed moſt agreeable to the libidinous diſpoſition of the Jews at that time; and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them by Moſes only on account <hi>of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their hearts;</hi> (ſee Matthew xix. 8.) I mean <hi>the giving a bill of divorce;</hi> for, in this caſe (when a man was obliged to marry one whom he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced) he might <hi>not put her away all his days.</hi> (See Deut. xxii. 28.)—A puniſhment of greater morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to the Jews than any other, which the learned Philo (though himſelf a Jew) candidly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Fol. 789. Paris Edition, 1640.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0189000900:10"/>This certainly was a ſufficient cauſe for ſecrecy on the man's part; ſo that, whether <hi>his way</hi> (or behaviour) <hi>with a maid</hi> was really criminal, or only imprudent (for either of them may be implied in the text) he would, as much as poſſible, conceal it from the world, and render it as <hi>uninveſtigable</hi> as the other things mentioned in the text to be too wonderful for Solomon; at leaſt his beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours would not be wanting to make it ſo.</p>
            <p>Neither can we ſuppoſe that the ſame earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours would be wanting on the young woman's part to conceal her diſgrace from her friends as long as ſhe could. But the reaſons for ſecrecy are far more obvious in the caſe of eſpouſed virgins; for, according to the law of Moſes (Deut. xxii. 23, 24.) if a man was baſe enough to ſeduce one of theſe, an ignominious death was to be the immediate and dreadful conſequence of a diſcovery; when both parties muſt ſhare the ſame wretched fate <note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xxii. 23, 24.</note>.</p>
            <p>Now if all that I have ſaid ſhall not be thought ſufficient to prove that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in this paſſage muſt neceſſarily ſignify a maid or virgin, I have never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the ſatisfaction of obſerving that the author of the objections, in page 20, allows it to be <q>a very obſcure paſſage;</q> and profeſſes to <q>lay no ſtreſs upon it;</q> and therefore, I think, I may ſafely conclude, at leaſt, that it is incapable of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0189000900:11"/>
proving any thing againſt the true ſenſe of the word in the other paſſages.</p>
            <p>The ſame author obſerves in page 19, that "other <hi>four places are abſolutely uncertain;</hi>" but they appear in a very different light to me.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of theſe places (Geneſis xxiv. 43.) the word is applied to Rebekah before her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, who in the ſame chapter is ſaid expreſly to be a <hi>virgin</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Dr. W—ms objects (in page 9.) that the 16th verſe of the ſeventh chapter of Iſaiah <q>cannot, in any ſenſe, be applied to the Meſſiah.</q> The words of this text, according to the Engliſh tranſlation, are as follows: <q>For before <hi>the child ſhall</hi> know to refuſe the evil, and chooſe the good, the land that thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her kings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This verſe ſeems to be the principal cauſe of his objections againſt the common interpretation of the two preceding verſes.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>The prophet meant</hi> to ſay, according to this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (ſays the Doctor) that the land <hi>of Judah,</hi> which Ahaz by his idolatry and wickedneſs had brought into trouble and difficulty, ſhould be delivered from <hi>both theſe kings:</hi>
               </q> (fo. 35.) by which the Doctor refers to <hi>Reſin</hi> king of Syria, and <hi>Pekah</hi> the ſon of Remaliah king of Iſrael, who at that time were confederate againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> and <q>went up towards Jeruſalem to war againſt it.</q> See the firſt part of the ſame chapter.—The Doctor repeats the ſame thing in page 37—viz.—the land <hi>(of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah)</hi> which thou (Ahaz) vexeſt, &amp;c. This throws great difficulty upon the text, which informs us, that the land which Ahaz vexed ſhould <q>be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of both <hi>her kings.</hi>
               </q> The conſtruction of the word rendered <hi>"her kings"</hi> requires us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that both the kings there ſpoken of ſhould be kings of that land which Ahaz vexed: <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Now the difficulty ceaſes, if it be admitted that the <hi>land which Ahaz vexed</hi> ſignified the land or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the twelve tribes of Iſrael, including Judah; which conſtruction the circumſtances of thoſe times will enable it to bear.</p>
            <p>Ahaz had interrupted the ſacrifices of atonement uſually offered up for <hi>all Iſrael</hi> in the temple at Jeruſalem, which was common to Jews and Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites; and therefore might truly be ſaid to <hi>vex</hi> the land of Iſrael, as well as Judah: for he not only <hi>"ſacrificed unto the gods of Damaſcus"</hi> (2 Chron. xxviii. 23.) but he <q>cut in pieces the veſſels of the houſe of God, and <hi>ſhut up the doors of the houſe of the Lord</hi>

               <q>The pride of Aſſyria ſhall be brought down, and <hi>the ſceptre of Egypt</hi> ſhall depart away,</q> ſays the ſame prophet in the 11th verſe of the ſucceeding chapter. The prophet Hoſea, likewiſe, uſes the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>When I firſt wrote this opinion, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the MS. to Dr. W—ms, I apprehended that the thought was intirely new;—ſo little am I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the republic of letters, for want of leiſure and opportunity to read!

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0189000900:22"/>
acknowledge myſelf obliged to Dr. W—ms for his information, that the learned Mr. Mann, in his diſſertation De anno natali Chriſti, <q>appears to be of the ſame opinion.</q> I had likewiſe the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, afterwards, to be informed by another gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman (a worthy friend of mine) that the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is recommended in the Univerſal Hiſt. vol. IV. of the Octavo, p. 154, with the note K.</p>
            <p>Now, that the opinion of the learned author may more clearly be underſtood, I will ſet down at length the whole that he wrote upon the text in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned the ſubject of Iſaiah's meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to Ahaz, he adds— <q>Here the king, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of reſpect or deſpondency and unbelief, —refuſing to aſk the promiſed ſign, the prophet aſſured him from the Lord, that—before <hi>that time</hi> came, a virgin ſhould conceive and bear a ſon, and call his name Himmanuel, or God with us; and ſo on.</q> (K).</p>
            <p>Upon this opinion he further explains himſelf in the following note:</p>

               <q>(K) This we take to be a much more natural ſenſe of that prophecy than to ſuppoſe, as ſome have done, that ſuch a miraculous child was really born in Ahaz's time, to aſſure him of the promiſed deliverance; for as there is not the leaſt mention of ſuch an extraordinary birth, ſo neither do we ſee that there was any neceſſity for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0189000900:23"/>
it, in order to convince the deſponding king, who could not be ignorant of that prophecy of Jacob, that the ſceptre ſhould not depart from Judah, till Shiloh was come, much leſs, that he was to ſpring of the lineage of David. But what ſtaggered Ahaz's faith, and made him fear that the regal power was going to depart from his family, was, that his two enemies had combined to ſet a ſtranger on his throne. All, therefore, that was wanting to diſpel his preſent fears about it, was for the prophet to aſſure him from God, that this Shiloh, promiſed to Judah and David, who was to fore-run the total exciſion of the Jewiſh polity, was to be born in a miraculous manner and with a divine character, and other remarkable circumſtances, ſuch as, he might be eaſily ſatisfied, had not as yet happened in his kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>As for that part of the prophecy which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly urged on the other ſide, namely, <q>Before this wonderful child ſhall know good from evil, the land which thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her kings:</q> We think, that if it be rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, it will rather confirm our ſenſe of the prophecy, and that the words ought to be thus rendered. For (or rather, as the particle <hi>chi</hi> ſeems to import here, nay) before this child can know good from evil, this land, which thou (not abhorreſt, as our verſion renders it, but) art ſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0189000900:24"/>
ſolicitous about, or giveſt up for loſt, ſhall be bereaved of both her kings; by which, we think, ought to be underſtood, not the kings of Syria and Iſrael, for the former could not be called her (Canaan's) king; and the latter had but a ſhare in it at beſt; <hi>but the kings of Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> as it really was before the coming of the Meſſiah.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In order to confirm this opinion, I have annexed to theſe remarks two diſtinct diſſertations: one on the prophecy of Iſaiah vii. 8. (—<q>and within threeſcore and five years ſhall Ephraim be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that it be not a people</q>); and the other on the famous prophecy of Jacob, concerning the ſceptre of Judah.</p>
            <p>In the former I ſhew, that the <hi>regal government</hi> of the <hi>houſe of Iſrael,</hi> as a ſeparate ſtate from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, was put an end to not a great many years after Iſaiah's prophecy.</p>
            <p>In the latter (I hope) I have proved that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal government of the houſe of Judah (I mean only the temporal or worldly kingdom of Judah) ceaſed preciſely at the time limited by Iſaiah in the prophecy now before us. So that, I flatter myſelf, it will appear upon the whole, that the land of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, including Judah (being the land which Ahaz <hi>vexed</hi>) was forſaken of <hi>"both her kings,"</hi> or regal governments, before the child Immanuel could <hi>"know to refuſe the evil and chooſe the good."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0189000900:25"/>For Herod the Great, on a careful examination (I believe) will be found to have been the laſt king of <hi>the whole land</hi> of <hi>Iſrael and Judah,</hi> which Ahaz <hi>vexed;</hi> and it is remarkable, that Chriſt, the true Immanuel, <hi>was a young child in the arms of his mother</hi> at the time of this monarch's death; ſoon after which, Joſeph, the huſband of the bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, was warned by an angel of the Lord in Egypt, ſaying, <q>Ariſe, and take THE YOUNG CHILD and his mother, and go into the <hi>land of Iſrael</hi>
               </q> (not the land of <hi>Judah</hi> only) <q>for they are <hi>dead</hi> which ſought the <hi>young child</hi>'s life.</q> Matth. ii. 20.</p>
            <p>But Dr. W—ms in a note (page 32.) obſerves, that the child Immanuel <q>could not be Chriſt, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> he is never called the king of Judah.</q> And he thinks that Nathaniel, when he called him <hi>the king of Iſrael,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>laboured</hi> under the ſame miſtake with all his countrymen, who expected a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Meſſiah.</q> The Doctor obſerves in the ſame note, that <hi>"Chriſt is king of the whole earth;"</hi> which he ſeems to aſſign as a reaſon, why <q>he is never called the king of Judah.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed it does not appear that the Doctor had any other foundation for his cenſure of Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel; though this argument is ſo far from being concluſive in favour of the Doctor's opinion, that it rather proves the contrary; for he that is king of <hi>the whole earth</hi> muſt neceſſarily, in a general ſenſe, be king of Iſrael and Judah; theſe titles
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0189000900:26"/>
being moſt certainly included in the former, even ſuppoſing the peculiar ſceptre of each kingdom to be departed.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the argument (ſuch as it is) is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and approved by the Critical Reviewers! for they quote the Doctor's words at length (ſee N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 136, fo. 356.) without offering any thing to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify Nathaniel from the charge of <hi>labouring under a miſtake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſhall therefore be my buſineſs to prove, that the miſtake does <hi>not reſt with Nathaniel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt is in a peculiar manner eternal king of Judah and Iſrael, as well as king of the whole earth, and <hi>heir of all things.</hi> (Heb. i. 2.) The angel Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel teſtified that Chriſt ſhould <hi>reign over the houſe of Jacob (which is Iſrael)</hi> for ever. See St. Luke i. 32. And the wiſe men of the Eaſt <hi>went to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and inquired, <q>Where is he that <hi>is born king of the Jews?</hi> for we have ſeen his ſtar in the Eaſt, and come</q> (that is, to Jeruſalem, the capital of his kingdom) <hi>"to worſhip him."</hi> See Matth. ii. 1, 2. Therefore the Doctor's objection that the child Immanuel could not be Chriſt, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is never called the king of Judah,</hi> ſeems to be intirely groundleſs; for the dominion of the land of Immanuel (mentioned in the eighth chapter of Iſaiah) may moſt certainly be attributed with more propriety to the Meſſiah, who <hi>was king</hi> and <hi>ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0189000900:27"/>
of Iſrael</hi> (ſee Ezek. xxxvii. 24. alſo xxxiv. 23, 24.) than to any ſon of Iſaiah whatever.</p>
            <p>Dr. W—ms may, perhaps, ſuppoſe, that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Iſrael and Judah could not belong to Chriſt, becauſe he refuſed to accept of any temporal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and withdrew himſelf when he perceived that the people would come, and take him by force to <hi>make him a king;</hi> (ſee John vi. 15.) and further, becauſe he even declared that his kingdom was not of this world. See chap. xviii. 36. But all this ſeems to relate only to the manner of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, in general, was merely ſpiritual. He was nevertheleſs <hi>king of Iſrael,</hi> being ſent in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; (ſee Matth. xv. 24.) and, for a time, Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem was <hi>the ſeat of his kingdom,</hi> when he went up to the feaſt; and a very great multitude ſpread their garments in the way (a greater mark of ſubmiſſion than is ever paid to temporal princes) and others cut down branches from the trees, and ſtrawed them in the way (ſee Matth. xxi. 8.) and cried, <hi>Hoſanna, Bleſſed is the</hi> KING OF ISRAEL that cometh in the name of the Lord. John xii. 13.</p>
            <p>Chriſt did not tell the multitude that they <q>
                  <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured</hi> under a miſtake</q> in calling him KING OF ISRAEL; on the contrary it appears, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the voice of the people; which could not have been the caſe, had he not been really <hi>king of Iſrael:</hi> for when the phariſees ſaid unto him,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0189000900:28"/>
Maſter, rebuke thy diſciples, he anſwered and ſaid unto them, <q>
                  <hi>I tell you, that if theſe ſhould</hi> hold their peace, the ſtones would immediately cry out.</q> Luke xix. 38, 39, 40. Thus was the Meſſiah not only <hi>"called," but proclaimed king of Iſrael;</hi> and as ſuch he received the homage of his people; yet in ſuch a manner, as beſt ſuited the ſacred character of him, who had <hi>rejected a worldly kingdom:</hi> for, inſtead of royal apparel and a triumphal car, he was <hi>"cloathed with humility,"</hi> and ſitting on an aſs, that the prophecy of Zechariah might be literally fulfilled.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; ſhout, O daughter of Jeruſalem: behold THY KING cometh unto thee: he is juſt, and having ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>lowly,</hi> and riding upon an aſs, and upon a colt the foal of an aſs.</q> (Zech. ix. 9.) But though Chriſt profeſſed that his kingdom was not of this world, yet there was no worldly man hardy enough to reſiſt or oppoſe his will, when he was pleaſed to exert his divine authority over them; for <q>he caſt out them that ſold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers, and the ſeats of them that ſold doves; and <hi>would not ſuffer</hi> that any man ſhould carry any veſſel through the temple.</q> Mark xi. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>And St. John informs us (chap. ii. 15.) that he made a ſcourge of ſmall cords, and drove them all (all ſuch as are above-mentioned) out of the temple.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0189000900:29"/>Of all the extraordinary things which Chriſt did, St. Jerome thought this to be the moſt wonderful, as Mr. Bragge remarks in his Practical Obſervations upon the Miracles. This perſonal authority and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Chriſt <hi>in Iſrael</hi> was expreſly foretold by the prophet Micah (chap. v. 2.) <q>But thou Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is, to be RULER IN IS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAEL; whoſe goings forth have been from of old <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <q>If he be <hi>the king of Iſrael</hi> (ſaid they) let him now come down from the croſs, and we will believe him.</q> Matth. xxvii. 42.</note>, becauſe they did not think him to be the true anointed or Meſſiah. Nevertheleſs, when the ſeveral extraordinary and miraculous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances relating to the birth, life, death, and perſecution of that moſt holy perſon (Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth) are candidly examined and carefully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0189000900:30"/>
with the prophetical declarations concerning the promiſed Meſſiah, it manifeſtly appears, that there were very ſufficient reaſons for acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that perſon to be both <hi>Lord and Chriſt</hi>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0189000900:31"/>Thus far I have ventured to ſuggeſt, in anſwer to Dr. W—ms's declaration in page 9,—that "the 16th verſe" (of the ſeventh chap. of Iſaiah) <hi>"cannot, in any ſenſe, be applied to the Meſſiah:"</hi> I hope I have proved that it may; nevertheleſs I muſt obſerve, that even the common interpretation of this paſſage is not ſo unreaſonable as Dr. W—ms ſeems to imagine; though, indeed, the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before given appears to be much leſs liable to exception.</p>
            <p>The Doctor animadverts ſeverely on the opinion of thoſe who ſay, that the paſſage contains two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct prophecies;—viz. that the verſes 14 and 15 relate to Chriſt, but the 16th to Iſaiah's ſon. <q>Is not this <hi>(ſays he)</hi> very unnatural? and, if I am not miſtaken, very unuſual?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the authors of the old commentary on the Bible, commonly called Aſſemblies Annotations, were of a very different opinion.</p>
            <p>They obſerve on this very text, that <q>
                  <hi>it is an uſual thing</hi> in Scripture, with our prophet Iſaiah eſpecially, by way of alluſion, to apply the ſame words and phraſes unto divers ſubjects, where occaſion is to ſpeak of them together:</q> and therefore they were of opinion, that the child men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the 16th verſe was <q>no other, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, than Shearjaſhub, the prophet's child, whom, to this purpoſe, God hath commanded him to take along with him.</q> How far this was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0189000900:32"/>
an uſual thing with Iſaiah, may be ſeen even in prophecies which were delivered on the ſame occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as the text in queſtion.</p>
            <p>For the further illuſtration of this point, I have added to my book a ſhort diſſertation on the nature and ſtyle of prophetical writings, ſhewing, that abrupt tranſitions from one ſubject to another are frequently found therein; and that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures afford many examples of prophecies, which are blended and interwoven with other ſubjects that are intirely different, both as to the matter and the time of accompliſhment.</p>
            <p>We muſt not expect to find all prophecies unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with difficulties: nevertheleſs, there are no difficulties in the ſeventh chapter of Iſaiah ſo great as thoſe, that are occaſioned by Dr. W—ms's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it. <q>This prophecy (ſays he) as I take it, relates to <hi>one perſon only,</hi> and that <hi>was the ſon of a young woman then preſent;</hi> which ſon was afterwards to be born.</q> See page 4.</p>

            <p>Indeed we read, in the eighth chapter, of a ſon, which the propheteſs conceived and bare unto Iſaiah; and likewiſe, that Iſaiah was careful to take unto him FAITHFUL WITNESSES TO RECORD con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him; <q>for (ſaid he) before the child ſhall have knowledge to cry, My father and my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which muſt be within two years) the RICHES of DAMASCUS, and the SPOIL of SAMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIA, ſhall be taken away before the king of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria.</q> Therefore this child was certainly the TEMPORARY SIGN of the promiſed deliverance from the <hi>two powers</hi> of DAMASCUS and SAMARIA; but, unfortunately for Dr. W—ms's hypotheſis, the ſaid child was NOT CALLED IMMANUEL, but MAHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHALAL-HASH-BAZ, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The Doctor will find, on a further examination of the text, that the birth of Iſaiah's ſon is only an <hi>alluſion</hi> or <hi>imperfect imitation</hi> of the former REMOTE SIGN mentioned in the ſeventh chapter (viz. of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel's birth) in the ſame manner as the <hi>brazen ſerpent</hi>

            <p>That <hi>"a woman ſhould compaſs a man"</hi> (viz. conceive and bear a ſon without the knowledge of man), this was an event ſcarcely to be expected or comprehended by man; it being the <hi>new thing</hi> which God had created in the earth, ſpoken of by the prophet Jeremiah xxxi. 22. <note n="*" place="bottom">"How long wilt thou go about, O thou back-ſliding daughter?

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0189000900:39"/>Here I muſt intirely agree with the Doctor, though I am not the better ſatisfied with his hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</p>
            <p>Now, that we may thoroughly underſtand the text in queſtion, it will be neceſſary to conſider St. Matthew's application of it.</p>
            <p>He informs us, that <q>the birth of Jeſus Chriſt was on this wiſe: When as his mother Mary was eſpouſed to Joſeph, before they came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe was found with <hi>child of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Then Joſeph her huſband, being a juſt man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on theſe things, behold, the <hi>angel of the Lord</hi> appeared unto him in a dream, ſaying, Joſeph, THOU SON OF DAVID, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for <hi>that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in her,</hi> IS OF THE HOLY GHOST. And ſhe ſhall bring forth a ſon, and thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>): for he ſhall <hi>ſave his people</hi> from their ſins. NOW ALL THIS <hi>was done, that it might be fulfilled</hi> which was ſpoken of the Lord by the prophet, ſaying, Behold, A VIRGIN ſhall be with child, and ſhall bring forth a ſon, and they ſhall call his name EMMANUEL, which being interpreted is, <hi>God with us.</hi>
               </q> Now Dr. W—ms hopes to excuſe himſelf and his hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis by alledging (ſee page 40.) that this is only <q>
                  <hi>an accommodation</hi> (by <hi>way of illuſtration,</hi> not

proof) of a paſſage to a particular ſenſe to which it <hi>originally had no reference.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But ſhould we not ſeem to pay very little regard to Goſpel teſtimony (I now ſpeak as to Chriſtians) if we were to ſuppoſe, that the prophecy <hi>originally had no reference</hi> to this event, when an apoſtle <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirms</hi> that it had?</p>
            <p>Might not Dr. Doddridge's obſervation (quoted in page 38 of the Crit.

            <p>He ſays (page 44.) <q>I think that the prophet had <hi>no reference to the Meſſiah,</hi> and that the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt only alludes to this paſſage in Iſaiah, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was <hi>remarkably ſuitable</hi> to the matter which he was relating.</q> Now the Doctor ſeems to have forgot his former opinion in page 23; viz. <q>that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            </p>
            <p>For if this were true, that <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0189000900:41"/>Nay, the Doctor has even taken great pains to render the text REMARKABLY UNSUITABLE! for he would have us underſtand that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the YOUNG WOMAN (as he conſtrues it) ſpoken of in the text, was ſo <hi>far from being a</hi> VIRGIN, that ſhe was with child ("IS CONCEIVING and BEARING a SON," ſays he in page 37.) even at the time when ſhe was pointed at (as he ſuppoſes in page 31.) by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.

            <p>Would it not be very unnatural to ſuppoſe, that the prophets have been intirely ſilent concerning this moſt remarkable ſign of the Meſſiah (viz. his being BORN OF A VIRGIN) inſomuch that an evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt ſhould be obliged to ACCOMMODATE to this <hi>ſingular circumſtance</hi> a paſſage, which originally had <hi>"no reference to</hi> THE MESSIAH?"

            <p>The evangeliſt thus expreſſes himſelf: <q>Now ALL THIS WAS DONE, that it <hi>might be fulfilled</hi> which was ſpoken of the Lord by the prophet,</q> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. which implies, that, if ALL THIS had not come to paſs, the <hi>word of the Lord by the prophet</hi> would not have <hi>been fulfilled;</hi> therefore this caſe is by no

means ſimilar to the inſtances of ACCOMMODATION drawn from the GRECIAN POETS <note n="*" place="bottom">The learned author whom Dr. W—ms has quoted in page 41, has made a very neceſſary reſerve on this head, which the Doctor has omitted in his quotation; viz. <q>But indeed to an attentive mind the difference will appear very great between the citations from prophane authors and the prophets.</q>
               </note> in page 41.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould any one attempt, now-a-days, to explain away the genuine meaning of a prophecy, <hi>ſo literally fulfilled</hi> by the miraculous birth of Chriſt, when even <hi>the Jewiſh interpreters,</hi> near 300 years (i. e. according to the Chronicon of Euſebius 279 years) before that wonderful event, had conſtrued the ſame prophecy in ſuch a manner, that it could not poſſibly be applied to any perſon whatſoever, except the promiſed Meſſiah, who ALONE WAS BORN OF A VIRGIN?</p>

            <p>It is remarkable, that all the ancient MSS. of the Septuagint, in different parts of the world, teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the truth of this reading; of which four in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular are of conſiderable authority on account of their very great antiquity; viz. the Vatican, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian, Complutenſian, and Venetian MSS. And though many copies of the Septuagint muſt have been in the hands of Jews, as well as others, both before and after the birth of Chriſt, yet I never heard that any perſon ever produced a copy which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted this original reading; for as the Septuagint was the common tranſlation uſed in the ſynagogues throughout all Aſia, Greece, and Egypt (ſee Bp. Walton's Prolegomena ix. p. 60. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 15.) any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in ſo remarkable a text as this would very ſoon have been diſcovered.</p>

               </note>. And laſtly, St. Matthew, whether he quoted the Original or Septuagint, was certainly convinced that the true ſenſe of the word was <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, a VIRGIN, and he hath accordingly left us his teſtimony of it; which proves that the Doctor's application of this word to <hi>the mother of Iſaiah's ſon</hi> muſt be very erroneous.</p>
            <p>The child, <hi>Immanuel,</hi> could not be Iſaiah's ſon, becauſe it appears from ſo many undeniable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that his <hi>mother</hi> was to be really <hi>a virgin;</hi> and becauſe <hi>the event itſelf</hi> (by which the prophecy is beſt underſtood) has proved this truth beyond all contradiction.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I think, I may now ſafely conclude in Dr. W—ms's own words, before quoted, that his opinion concerning this text <q>IS UTTERLY IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CONSISTENT WITH THE WORDS OF ST.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0189000900:48"/>
contain prophecies of very diſtant events, which are ſo blended with the tranſactions of the (then) preſent times, that it would not be eaſy to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the real difference in point of chronology, if the apparent accompliſhment of theſe ſeveral prophecies did not remove the difficulty. Rezin and Pekah are both particularly mentioned in the 7th chapter, wherein the extraordinary birth of the <hi>child Immanuel</hi> is given as a ſign. The ſpoiling of their reſpective cities is promiſed in the 8th chapter <note n="†" place="bottom">"For before the child <hi>(Maher-ſhalal-haſh-baz)</hi> ſhall have knowledge to cry, My father and my mother, the <hi>riches of Damaſcus,</hi> and the <hi>ſpoil of Samaria,</hi> ſhall be taken away before the king of Aſſyria." viii. 4. "Foraſmuch as this people refuſeth the waters of Shiloah that go ſoftly, and rejoice in <hi>Rezin,</hi> and <hi>Remaliah</hi>'s <hi>ſon:</hi> Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth upon them the waters of the river, ſtrong and many, even the king of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi>" &amp;c.—"And the ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his wings ſhall fill the breadth of thy land, <hi>O Immanuel.</hi>" viii. 6, 7, 8.</note>, wherein the birth of the child Maher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalalhaſhbaz the ſon of Iſaiah is foretold, as the temporary ſign of the ſame; and notwithſtanding that the greateſt part of the ſaid chapter relates to thoſe times, yet the prophet introduces in the very midſt of it a plain reference to the times of the Meſſiah, ſee 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th verſes, which ſhall be hereafter conſidered.

But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe plain teſtimonies, Dr. W—ms is of a very different opinion. <q>Iſaiah does not ſeem, <hi>(ſays the Dr. in a note, p. 32)</hi> to ſpeak of the Meſſiah till the ixth chapter.</q> But though the Dr. here allows that the ixth chapter contains a prophecy concerning the Meſſiah; yet perhaps he is not aware, that if his reaſons againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon interpretation of the viith chapter (on account of <hi>"the preſent order, and abrupt tranſition"</hi> which he complains of in p. 10.) <hi>were at all concluſive,</hi> the ſame would hold good likewiſe againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon interpretation of this ixth chapter; wherein the <hi>tranſitions</hi> from one ſubject to another are equally <hi>abrupt,</hi> and the remote events concerning the <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>preaching</hi> of the Meſſiah are foretold, even before other events <q>which were immediately, or very ſhortly to happen.</q> (See p. 9.)</p>
            <p>The Dr. may be right enough in his obſervation that there are no inſtances <q>of <hi>remote ſigns</hi> to prove the accompliſhment of an event near at hand.</q> (See pages 9 and 10.) But it is plainly his own miſtake which cauſes the difficulty that he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0189000900:58"/>
ſpeaks of; for the ſign given by Iſaiah of the birth of <hi>Immanuel,</hi> (viz. behold a virgin ſhall conceive, &amp;c.) was not a remote ſign of <hi>an event near at hand</hi> (as the Dr. ſuppoſes) but a <hi>remote ſign</hi> of <hi>a remote event,</hi> and therefore not liable to his cenſure.</p>
            <p>The holy ſcriptures afford a great many other examples of prophecies, which are blended and interwoven with very different ſubjects; different, I ſay, both with reſpect to the matter, and the time of accompliſhment.</p>
            <p>There are alſo many inſtances of paſſages which bear a double conſtruction, being partly applicable to ſome particular perſon expreſly mentioned, though they ultimately and chiefly relate to another very different perſon.</p>

Thus it is plain that the glory of the ſecond houſe did not conſiſt either in the grandeur of the building laid out by Zerubbabel and Joſhua, or in the preſence of thoſe great and holy men; notwithſtanding that the prophecy is addreſſed to them both, and that Zerubbabel is ſpoken to by God in a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable manner at the concluſion of the ſame chapter, viz. <q>I will take thee, <hi>O Zerubbabel my ſervant,</hi> the ſon of Shealtiel, ſaith the Lord, and will make <hi>thee as a ſignet: for I have choſen thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</q> But the glory was, manifeſtly, to conſiſt in the "<hi>future coming,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the deſire of all nations.</hi>" For as the promiſe was made to Zerubbabel and Joſhua themſelves, the prophecy muſt neceſſarily be underſtood to have a more diſtant accompliſhment; which indeed the beginning of the ſentence ſufficiently proves, viz. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>It would make a large volume if I were to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all the prophecies which abſolutely relate to two different and diſtinct ſubjects in the type and antitype. Nevertheleſs, I am particularly obliged to take notice of two more of this kind, becauſe Dr. W—ms has quoted them in favour of his hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, notwithſtanding that upon examination they will be found to make much againſt it. He ſays (in p. 38.) <q>it is <hi>not poſſible indeed</hi> to <hi>reconcile Matthew</hi> ii. 15.23. and perhaps ſome other paſſages in his goſpel, with <hi>any particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy now extant</hi> in the Old Teſtament.</q> As to the 15th verſe, wherein St. Matthew quotes the Prophet Hoſea xi. 1. <q>(out of Egypt have I called my ſon)</q> the Dr. obſerves that <q>the paſſage in Hoſea where theſe words are found, <hi>is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of a future event,</hi> but a declaration of an event long paſt, and therefore <hi>could not be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi> when the child JESUS came out of Egypt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, in one reſpect, the Dr. is right, viz. that the paſſage, with regard to the people of Iſrael, <q>is a declaration of an event long paſt:</q> nevertheleſs he has not aſſigned any reaſon why the ſame paſſage may not, <hi>likewiſe,</hi> contain a prophecy <hi>of a future event,</hi> by being intended, like many other prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to bear a double application.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0189000900:66"/>Eraſmus has aſſigned a reaſon for the error of Julian the apoſtate concerning this text; viz. <q>that he has too much followed the ſeptuagint edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>nimirum ſecutus editionem ſeptuaginta</hi>
               </q> (ſays he) <q>qui locum hunc tranſtulerunt in hunc mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, quia <hi>parvulus</hi> Iſrael, et ego dilexi <hi>eum,</hi> et ex Aegypta vocavi <hi>filics ejus.</hi>
               </q> (Annot. in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaeum, p. 250.)</p>
            <p>A miſunderſtanding of this text is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeable, likewiſe, in the authors of that Greek verſion, who could not eaſily comprehend <hi>before the event,</hi> that the Meſſiah ſhould be called out of Egypt, as the children of Iſrael had been before him; and therefore they rendered the paſſage in ſuch a manner as they thought would beſt point out the application of it to the people of Iſrael <hi>only;</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But if the <hi>prophet himſelf</hi> had intended the ſame thing, <hi>and that only,</hi> he would, moſt likely, have made uſe of terms more expreſſive of <hi>a nation,</hi> or <hi>people,</hi> than of <hi>a ſingle perſon;</hi> 
               <q>(from Egypt have I called my ſon,</q> —) and then the Greek inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters would not have been obliged to leave the literal ſenſe of the original in order to adopt it with propriety to <hi>the people of Iſrael;</hi> which proves, that ſome <hi>ſingle perſon</hi> is more particularly pointed at by the prophet, than <hi>the people</hi> of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>There are, indeed, many paſſages of Scripture, wherein nations are repreſented by ſingle perſons;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0189000900:67"/>
Ezekiel warned the <hi>two houſes</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the figure of two adulterous women, Aholah and Aho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libah, &amp;c. But the text in queſtion is very different from many others of that kind; for the <hi>people</hi> of Iſrael are not only repreſented therein under the figure of a <hi>ſingle perſon,</hi> but ſome eminent ſingle perſon is likewiſe plainly repreſented, at the ſame time, under the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>people of Iſrael,</hi> of which the particularity of the ſtile affords evident teſtimony <gap reason="foreign">

               <q>when Iſrael was <hi>a little child,</hi> and I loved <hi>him,</hi> and out of Egypt have I <hi>called my Son.</hi>
               </q> But the following part of the text, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Iſrael could not be a type of the Meſſiah (I mean their forſaking God's commandments, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing to Baal) is immediately expreſſed in <hi>the plural number,</hi> as being applicable to the children of Iſrael <hi>only,</hi> and not to Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">

               <note n="†" place="bottom">The prophecy was, indeed, delivered in the <hi>perfect tenſe,</hi> as a thing already paſt; but this did not prevent the application of it to the <hi>future Meſſiah,</hi> becauſe the <hi>perfect tenſe</hi> is, almoſt, as frequently uſed by the prophets in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring <hi>futurity,</hi> even as the <hi>future</hi> itſelf.</note> out of Egypt, is indeed expreſly named <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but this is ſo far from ſetting aſide the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to Chriſt, that, on the contrary, it affords the ſtrongeſt confirmation of it: for this name was neceſſarily given in the prophecy, that the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation might be double; viz. firſt to the people of Iſrael, and laſtly to the Meſſiah.</p>
            <p>The Meſſiah is expreſly called <hi>Iſrael</hi> by Iſaiah (xlix. 3.) in a prophecy which cannot, <hi>at all, be</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the <hi>people of Iſrael,</hi> like the former; but muſt relate <hi>entirely</hi> to Chriſt. viz. <q>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0189000900:71"/>
between two diſtinct perſons, who are both men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this laſt (the 7th) verſe; viz. "the Lord (<gap reason="foreign">

               </q> and who is alſo called <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the former part of this chapter. Now it is remarkable, that the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or tribes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> are likewiſe diſtinctly mentioned in the ſame prophecy; ſo that the perſon, to whom the Lord ſaid, <hi>"Thou art my ſervant, O Iſrael,"</hi> (ſee 3d verſe) cannot mean any other perſon beſides the Meſſiah himſelf; he alone being the true <q>light to lighten the Gentiles, <hi>and</hi> the glory of his people <hi>ISRAEL.</hi>
               </q> For though the <hi>Jewiſh Religion</hi> was for many ages the only true religion, yet the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not induced, univerſally, to acknowledge the truth of the Holy Scriptures by becoming proſelytes to <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> but by being <hi>converts to Chriſt,</hi> by whom alone they have been <hi>enlightened</hi> according to the Scriptures.

            <p>I have already ſaid ſo much concerning the nature of prophecy in general, and have quoted ſo many examples of two different ſubjects being referred to by one and the ſame prophetical expreſſion, that (I hope) I need not any longer urge the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a double application, likewiſe, of the text quoted by St. Matthew from the Prophet Hoſea; eſpecially as Dr. W—ms has not aſſigned any one reaſon why it ought to be otherwiſe; nor any authority whatſoever for his aſſertion in page 39, that the paſſage <hi>"could not be fulfilled when the child Jeſus came out of Egypt;"</hi> except, indeed, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his own bare word: which, nevertheleſs, ſeems to have had ſufficient weight with the Critical Reviewers, though it is oppoſed to the <hi>expreſs teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> even of <hi>an Evangeliſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other quotation of St. Matthew, which Dr. W—ms has called in queſtion, is given in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0189000900:73"/>
2d chapter 23d verſe. viz. <q>He ſhall be called a Nazarene.</q> This is one of the texts concerning which the Dr. affirms in page 38, that <hi>"it is not poſſible to reconcile"</hi> (it) <q>with any particular prophecy now extant in the Old Teſtament.</q> But he is greatly miſtaken in this; for the text may certainly be reconciled, not only with one prophecy, but with many very <hi>particular prophecies</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>now</hi> extant in the Old Teſtament;</q> and therefore St. Matthew ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals with <hi>great propriety in this caſe,</hi> not to one prophet alone, but to the <hi>ſenſe of all the prophets in general.</hi> viz. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>If all this be conſidered, I think, the fitneſs of St. Matthew's appeal to the prophets, concerning the word <gap reason="foreign">

which ſhall <hi>not taſte of death,</hi> till they ſee the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</q> Matth. xvi. 28. And again, <q>If I will that he (John) <hi>tarry till I come,</hi> what is that to thee?</q> John xxi. 22. Here our Lord makes uſe of <q>the ſame words and phraſes</q> with which he was wont to expreſs his <hi>ſecond coming to judge</hi> the world; ſo that his diſciples underſtood, that John ſhould not die; whereas the event plainly ſhewed, that he <q>meant of his <hi>coming</hi>
               </q> (ſo often mentioned in the New Teſtament) <q>in judgment upon the Jews at the final overthrow of Jeruſalem, which St. John outlived many years.</q> See Dr. <hi>Cave on the Life of that Diſciple,</hi> Antiquitates Apoſtolicae, p. 158.</p>
            <p>Our Lord, likewiſe, <q>uſed the ſame words and phraſes</q> unto theſe <hi>two different ſubjects,</hi> viz. his <hi>coming</hi> in judgment upon Jeruſalem, and his laſt <hi>coming</hi> to judge the world, <q>when occaſion was to ſpeak of them together,</q> according to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation before quoted from Aſſemblies Annotations; inſomuch that the <hi>day of judgment,</hi> and the <hi>end of the world</hi> were expected to follow immediately after the accompliſhment of Chriſt's prophecies in the xxivth chap. of Matthew, xiiith of Mark, and xxiſt of Luke concerning <hi>God's judgment in the deſtruction</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The latter, however, may indeed be conſidered as a ſign, or type, of the <hi>great and laſt day;</hi> and the accompliſhment of the prophecies concerning it is undoubtedly a ſure pledge of <hi>God's future</hi> judgment:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0189000900:79"/>
juſt in the ſame manner as the <hi>temporary deliverance</hi> from Rezin and Pekah, promiſed to Ahaz and the houſe of David by Iſaiah, was properly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and pledge of the future diſtant deliverance promiſed in the perſon of <hi>Immanuel.</hi> Therefore if Dr. W—ms ſuppoſes (as he hints in the words of Mr. Collins in page 7.) that this ſign ſtood in need of other ſigns to manifeſt that God would perform it in time, let him conſider the context once more, and he will find, that the ſign was not without ſuch a manifeſtation as Mr. Collins and himſelf have required. Perhaps it may be ſaid, that I have troubled my readers with a great many more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>"types, figures, and ſecondary ſenſes,"</hi> than were neceſſary for the point in queſtion; but I was induced thereto by the too haſty cenſure paſſed on theſe ſort of writings by the authors of the <hi>Critical Review</hi> in page 349, where they ſeem to condemn all <hi>types,</hi> &amp;c. whatſoever indiſcriminately, without deigning to diſtinguiſh the difference between <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per types</hi> and <hi>imaginary</hi> ones.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE accompliſhment of Iſaiah's prophecy (in confirmation of which he required Ahaz to aſk a ſign) was not <q>an event near at hand,</q> as Dr. W—ms ſuppoſes; for no leſs a term than ſixty-five years was allowed for the accompliſhment of one of the circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it; viz.— <q>
                  <hi>within threeſcore and five years</hi> ſhall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</q> Iſaiah vii. 8.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the king, or regal government of Ephraim (or Iſrael, for Ephraim in this text ſeems to be put for the ten tribes of Iſrael, as ſeparated
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0189000900:82"/>
from Judah) laſted no longer than about twenty-one years after the prophecy was delivered; for <hi>"in the ninth year of Hoſhea"</hi> (the ſixth of Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah) <q>the king of Aſſyria took Samaria, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Iſrael away into Aſſyria,</q> (2 Kings xvii. 6.) therefore commentators have generally found it very difficult to account for the number of <hi>ſixty-five years</hi> mentioned in this prophecy.</p>
            <p>A very learned and juſtly eſteemed author <note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Newton on the Prophecies.</note>, in order to ſolve the difficulty, has applied ſeveral texts in the ſecond book of Kings to an imaginary cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity or carrying away by Eſarhaddon, which, if the context be carefully conſidered, will be found to relate, undoubtedly, to the <hi>real</hi> captivity under Salmanaſſer. We underſtand, indeed, from Ezra iv. 2. that the adverſaries of Benjamin and Judah (the Samaritans) dated the time of their ſettlement in the cities of Samaria from <q>the days of Eſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haddon king of Aſſur, which <hi>(as they ſaid)</hi> brought us up hither.</q> But there is no neceſſity to ſuppoſe, that Eſarhaddon carried any people away into captivity from thence, nor any evidence to ſupport ſuch a ſuppoſition. Was it not poſſible for Eſarhaddon to plant freſh colonies in the land of Iſrael, where it was too thinly inhabited by the former colonies, without having carried away any of the inhabitants into captivity? Surely it was not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0189000900:83"/>
only poſſible, but moſt probable, that this was really the caſe; notwithſtanding that ſeveral other learned men, beſides Bp. Newton, have thought otherwiſe; and particularly Fr. Junius, quoted by Dr. Simſon in his Chronicon Catholicum (pars 3tia, p. 69.) But the Doctor himſelf ſufficiently accounts for the paſſages in Ezra (ch. iv. 2 and 10.); ſo that there is no neceſſity to ſuppoſe another captivity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Eſarhaddon:— <q>Quanquam enim Salmanaſar illam coloniam primus deduxerit, tamen cum plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimi incolarum à feris, &amp; fortè peſtilentiâ (ſic enim ait Joſephus libro nono) extincti eſſent, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea plures ab Aſarhaddone illuc miſſos fuiſſe <hi>veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimile eſt.</hi>
               </q> And he likewiſe quotes Nicholaus Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantinus to the ſame purpoſe:— <q>Leones enim vaſtaverunt magnam partem populi quem Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſar miſerat: propter quod iſte Aſarhaddon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit alios loco ipſorum, &amp; cum iis unum de ſacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus captivis, qui doceret eos colere Dominum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The prophet does not ſay, that <hi>Ephraim ſhall be broken from a kingdom in ſixty-five years,</hi> but that within ſuch a time he ſhall be <hi>broken from a people;</hi> therefore it is plain that the prophecy could not be accompliſhed by the captivity of Ephraim, and the deſtruction of the <hi>regal government</hi> of Samaria by Salmanaſſar; becauſe Ephraim, or the children of Iſrael, might be ſtill called <hi>a people,</hi> or nation, even after their removal into a ſtrange country, for they could not be ſaid to <hi>"be broken from a people,"</hi>

until the judgments denounced againſt them by the prophet Amos (ix. 4.) ſhould be fulfilled, viz. <q>Though they go into captivity before their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, thence will I command the ſword, and it ſhall ſlay them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It appears from the hiſtory of Tobit, that this really came to paſs; for he ſpeaks of the frequent ſlaughter made of <hi>the people</hi> of <hi>his nation</hi> by Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib, chap. i. 17, 18, <q>for in his wrath he ſlew many.</q> And even in the reign of Eſarhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, about <hi>ſixty-five years</hi> after Iſaiah's prophecy, notwithſtanding that Achiarcharus, Tobit's nephew, was appointed over all the king's affairs (21ſt verſe) we find an inſtance recorded of the continuation of this perſecution.</p>
            <p>For when Tobit was told (chap. ii. 3.) that one of his nation was ſtrangled, and caſt out in the market-place, he remembered (6th verſe) <q>
                  <hi>that prophecy of Amos,</hi> as he ſaid (ſee Amos viii. 10.) Your feaſts ſhall be turned into mourning, and all your mirth into lamentation:</q> for it was then the <hi>feaſt of pentecoſt,</hi> or ſeven weeks, and Tobit had ſent out to invite ſuch of his poor brethren as feared the Lord, that they <hi>might partake of the "good dinner</hi> which was <hi>prepared;</hi>" but, in the mean time, he received this melancholy account; (ſee 1ſt, 2d, and 3d verſes) which proves the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of his quotation from Amos. The ſame chapter of Amos contains a paſſage very ſuitable to my purpoſe (viii. 2, 3.)</p>
            <p>

               <q>
                  <hi>The end is come upon my people of Iſrael;</hi> I will not again paſs by them any more. And the ſongs of the temple ſhall be howlings in that day,</q> (ſee 10th verſe, quoted by Tobit— <q>and all your ſongs into lamentation) <hi>ſaith the Lord God, there</hi> ſhall be many dead bodies <hi>in every place,</hi> they ſhall caſt them forth with ſilence.</q> I am ſenſible that the apocryphal book of Tobit ought not to be conſidered of ſufficient authority for the proof of any thing; yet I hope that the remarkable corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence it bears to the ſubject in queſtion, will excuſe my quotation.</p>

            <p>So we need not doubt but that, by this and other ſuch heavy judgments of God, the captives of the ten tribes of Iſrael would be ſo much reduced in number within the <hi>term of threeſcore and five years</hi> mentioned by Iſaiah, that Ephraim might well be ſaid to <hi>be broken from a people;</hi> for we read in Deut. xxviii. 61, 62. <q>Alſo every ſickneſs and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, them will the Lord bring upon thee, until thou be deſtroyed. And ye ſhall <hi>be left few in number</hi>
               </q> (which agrees well with the expreſſion of Iſaiah concerning Ephraim's being <q>broken, that it be not a people,</q> viz. being now left <hi>few in

number</hi>) <q>whereas ye were as the ſtars of heaven for multitude.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The completion of Iſaiah's prophecy concerning Ephraim is very apparent, even in another way; for though ſome of Ephraim, and of all the other tribes, were afterwards ſettled in Judaea and other places; though we read of <hi>a remnant of Iſrael</hi> (ſee 2 Chron. xxxiv. 9.) that contributed to the repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the temple in the reign of Joſiah king of Judah, long after the completion of <hi>the ſixty-five years</hi> limited by Iſaiah; and though Manaſſeh and Ephraim are expreſly mentioned on the ſame occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; nevertheleſs, this remnant of Ephraim, or Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, could have no pretenſions, as before, to be eſteemed a ſeparate people or nation from Judah, becauſe they were once more become ſubject to the laws and regal government of <hi>the tribe of Judah,</hi> of which the authority exerciſed among them by Joſiah is a ſufficient proof; and therefore, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that on ſome particular occaſions they were diſtinguiſhed by their tribes, yet, as a body or nation, they were generally afterwards eſteemed a <hi>part of the tribe of Judah;</hi> which accounts for the expreſſion of the hiſtorian (2 Kings xvii. 18.) <hi>"There was none left but the tribe of Judah only;"</hi> that is, there was none left but part of the tribes of Levi, Benjamin, and ſuch individuals of the other tribes as lived in (or might have eſcaped into) the inheritance of Judah, and conſequently were

               <hi>Jews.</hi> Thus the title of <hi>Jews</hi> became general about this time to all the other tribes, as well as Judah; for the kingdom <hi>of Iſrael</hi> was never afterwards reſtored in a ſeparate ſtate from Judah; and therefore after the captivity by Salmanaſſar, <hi>the land which Ahaz vexed</hi> might be ſaid to <hi>"be forſaken of"</hi> one of <hi>"her kings,"</hi>

            <p>But the ſucceſſion of the kings of Judah con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued regularly until the Babyloniſh captivity; and on account of this interruption (or of others after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) the land could not be ſaid to be <hi>forſaken of both her kings,</hi> if the regal government was to be afterwards reſtored for any conſiderable length of time: and we find <hi>that many kings reigned in Judah</hi> after that period.

            <p>IN the preceding Diſſertation concerning Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, I have obſerved that the ſceptre was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the inheritance of Judah during the reigns of all the Aſmonaean princes.</p>
            <p>And I believe the Jews themſelves will not deny, that the ſaid reigns include a part of the continuation of the ſceptre in Judah, as promiſed by the patriarch Jacob: therefore, I preſume, it will not be neceſſary for me to examine the Jewiſh hiſtories further back, than the time when the ſceptre was tranſlated into the family of Antipater; ſo that I propoſe to begin this Diſſertation where I left off in the laſt; viz. with the reign of Herod the Great.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0189000900:93"/>Herod had as much right to be eſteemed a Jew, or of the tribe of Judah <note n="*" place="bottom">The ingenious Mr. Mann, in the firſt ſection of his 6th chapter de anno natali Chriſti, endeavours to prove that Herod was really a Jew. There are likewiſe ſeveral other parts of that learned book, which would both illuſtrate and confirm many of the points which I have advanced; nevertheleſs, as I cannot entirely agree with him in all his opinions, and as I had finiſhed my remarks (except a ſhort addition at the end of this Diſſertation) before I had the ſatisfaction of reading his work, I ſhall therefore content myſelf with referring my readers to the book itſelf.</note>, as the Aſmonaean princes of the tribe of Levi: for not only the deſcendants of the twelve tribes were called Jews after the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh captivity (as I have before obſerved) but even the <hi>proſelytes of the</hi> Jews, though they were by birth <hi>Gentiles</hi> of any other nation whatſoever.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But king Herod's claim of relationſhip did not depend upon this ſingle circumſtance of his being deſcended from the Idumaeans.

Herod was born a ſubject of the kingdom of the Jews, and publickly profeſſed their religion, laws, and cuſtoms, notwithſtanding that he frequently offended againſt them all: and if he did not think himſelf, in reality, intitled to be eſteemed one of that nation, he nevertheleſs omitted no proper oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of claiming relationſhip.

            <p>There are many other inſtances in Joſephus of Herod's expreſſing himſelf in this manner: and indeed the ſingular circumſtances of this monarch's connections with the Jews rendered his claim of relationſhip ſo juſt, that it could not be diſputed, although he was not deſcended of any of the twelve tribes. Joſephus, who called Herod's father (An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater) <hi>an Idumaean,</hi> does not deny that he was a Jew, but only that he <hi>was not deſcended from the chief Jews, who came into Judaea from Babylon,</hi> which had been aſſerted by Nicholas of Damaſcus.

            <p>For the ſaid prophecy does not (I apprehend) ſo much relate to the deſcent or genealogy of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals that were to rule in Judah, as to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular pre-eminence of that whole tribe, from which the ſceptre (the ſign of its being a diſtinct kingdom)

            <p>Thus it is plain that the <hi>regal ſceptre</hi> was not <hi>to depart from the tribe of Judah</hi> till Shiloh was come.</p>
            <p>Now the Meſſiah was not born until towards the cloſe of <hi>king Herod's</hi> reign, therefore the <hi>ſceptre of Judah</hi> could not be ſaid to depart, or begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part (<hi>"be departing,"</hi> as ſome commentators have fancied) before that period.

But <hi>immediately after his death,</hi> the form of government was entirely altered. There was no longer <hi>a ſceptre</hi> in the tribe or inheritance of Judah!

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0189000900:101"/>
the ſceptre departed from Judah. A ſolemn lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fifty ambaſſadors from Jeruſalem (who were backed by eight thouſand Jews at Rome) ſollicited Caeſar that their regal government might be changed, and that they might be added to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Syria, and become ſubject to the Roman commanders that ſhould be ſent there.—<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>On the other hand, likewiſe, the reign of Agrippa was ſo very ſhort in compariſon of the time that the ſceptre had been departed from Judah, that, I think, it can ſcarcely be conſidered as an exception either to the prophecy of Jacob, or to this of Iſaiah, concerning <hi>the two kings;</hi> eſpecially as Agrippa was cut off from his kingdom by a very remarkable interpoſition of Divine Providence: for after he had ſlain St. James (the brother of St. John) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned St. Peter, and otherwiſe grievouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Chriſtians, he fulfilled the meaſure of his iniquity by accepting the idolatrous flattery of the people at Caeſarea; <q>and immediately the angel of the Lord ſmote him, becauſe he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten up of worms, and gave up the ghoſt;</q> (Acts xii. 23.) having reigned over Judah only <hi>three years</hi> according to Joſephus, who, in the 19th book of his Antiquities, chap. 7. p. 679, confirms the account given by St. Luke, though in ſome particulars his relation is different. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Perhaps ſome critic may object, that, as Chriſt was undoubtedly <hi>king of Iſrael and Judah,</hi> the ſceptre of Judah cannot be ſaid to depart at the death of Herod according to the interpretation juſt now given of the patriarch Jacob's prophecy: therefore it is neceſſary for me to obſerve, that the <hi>ſceptre</hi> ſpoken of in this prophecy, and the ceaſing of the two kings or regal governments, ſpoken of by Iſaiah, can only be underſtood to mean the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the <hi>worldly ſceptre,</hi> and <hi>temporal regal authority</hi> from Judah and Iſrael, as neceſſarily to be

diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>ſpiritual authority, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly kingdom</hi> of Chriſt; for as Chriſt was <q>born king of the Jews,</q> ſo the ſceptre of Judah with reſpect to him is not departed, but is everlaſting, according to the prophecy of the Royal Pſalmiſt concerning Chriſt's kingdom. <q>Thy throne, <hi>O God, is for ever and ever: the ſceptre</hi> of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is <hi>a right ſceptre.</hi> Thou loveſt righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and hateſt wickedneſs; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladneſs above thy fellows.</q> Pſalm xlv. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>The other part of Jacob's prophecy concerning Judah (viz. <hi>"nor a lawgiver from between his feet"</hi>) does not relate (I apprehend) to the ſceptre or regal government of Judah; for the particle <gap reason="foreign">

Judah might likewiſe be properly called <hi>a lawgiver</hi> (Pſalms lx. 7. cviii. 8.) becauſe <hi>the Meſſiah</hi> was to be born of that tribe. But the Scribes and Phariſees, or the Sanhedrin, were not ſent by God with any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther revelation, than what had before been given by Moſes and the Prophets; and therefore, though they ſat in Moſes' ſeat (Matt. xxiii. 2.) yet they could not properly be called lawgivers; being only <hi>lawyers or expounders</hi> of the law of Moſes: and, if no perſon among the Jews for above ſeventeen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years has had a better claim to the title of lawgiver than theſe, it muſt plainly appear that the lawgiver (as well as the ſceptre) is departed from Judah; and conſequently, that the Meſſiah came before that time.

            <p>John was not, indeed, of the tribe of Judah, yet it cannot be denied, but that he was <hi>a Jew,</hi> according to what has been before obſerved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Aſmonaean princes, and <q>Herod the king of Judea</q> (Luke i. 5.): and he might very well be accounted a <hi>lawgiver from between the feet of Judah,</hi> for he was born in the <hi>hill country of Judea</hi> (Luke i. 65.) in a <hi>city of Juda</hi> (Luke i. 39.

            </p>
            <p>But the circumſtance which more particularly points out the accompliſhment of Jacob's prophecy in this holy Nazarite <note n="†" place="bottom">John was a <q>
                     <hi>Nazarite</hi> unto God from his mother's womb,</q> as Sampſon, one of the <hi>judges</hi> of Iſrael, had been before him. (Compare Judges xvi. 17. with St. Luke i. 15.) But Chriſt could not properly be called a Nazarite (as Dr. W—ms ſuppoſes him to be) without a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the uſual ſenſe of that title in the Jewiſh law.</note> is, that John was the very laſt of the <hi>Jewiſh lawgivers or prophets.</hi> For though, on extraordinary occaſions, ſome prophetical ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences may have been uttered by men adhering to Judaiſm, after the coming of Chriſt (ſuch as the remarkable prophecy of Caiaphas the high-prieſt concerning Chriſt— <q>that it was expedient that one man ſhould die for the people,</q> &amp;c. (John xi. 50.) <note n="‡" place="bottom">See what a manifeſt (though unwilling) teſtimony, even <hi>the unbelieving Jews</hi> bare of Chriſt's heavenly miſſion. — <q>Then gathered the chief prieſts and the Phariſees a council, and ſaid, <hi>What do we?</hi> for <hi>this man doeth many miracles.</hi> If we thus let him alone, <hi>all men will believe on him;</hi> and the Romans <hi>ſhall come and take away both our place and nation.</hi> And one of them named Caiaphas, being <hi>the high-prieſt</hi> that ſame year, ſaid unto them, Ye know nothing at all, nor conſider that it is expedient for us, <hi>that one man ſhould die for the people, and that the whole nation periſh not.</hi> And this ſpake he not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but being high-prieſt that year, <hi>he propheſied</hi> that Jeſus ſhould die for that nation,</q> &amp;c. John xi. 47—51.</note> yet the Jews cannot prove that a ſingle prophet
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0189000900:118"/>
(profeſſedly as ſuch) has been ſent to them from God ever ſince the time of John; that is, for above 1700 years; except they will condeſcend to allow to St. Paul, Agabus, and others of the primitive Chriſtians, the title of prophets: but theſe were under the diſpenſation of the New Teſtament, after the ceremonial and typical law was annulled, and therefore cannot be reckoned among the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> lawgivers or prophets.</p>
            <p>This was confirmed by Chriſt himſelf (Luke xvi. 16.) "the <hi>law</hi> and the <hi>prophets</hi> were <hi>until John.</hi>" —And again (Matth. xi. 12, 13.) <q>
                  <hi>for</hi> all the prophets <hi>and</hi> the law propheſied until John.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſufficient authorities, I hope, to juſtify my ſuppoſition, that the <hi>prophet</hi> and <hi>lawgiver de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Judah</hi> at the death of John the Baptiſt; or rather, was gradually departing for ſome time before his death: becauſe as <hi>Chriſt increaſed, John decreaſed,</hi> according to his own prophecy recorded by John the Evangeliſt, (iii. 30.) <q>Ye yourſelves bear me witneſs, that I ſaid, <hi>I am not the Chriſt,</hi> but that I am ſent before him.

               </q> (that is, <hi>the church</hi> or congregation; for John had juſt before been told that Chriſt <q>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth, <hi>and</hi> all men come to him,</q> 26th verſe) <q>is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, which ſtandeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly becauſe of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy is therefore fulfilled. He <hi>muſt increaſe,</hi>

                     <q>When therefore the Lord knew how the Phariſees had heard that Jeſus made and baptized <hi>more diſciples</hi> than John (though Jeſus himſelf baptized not, but his diſciples) he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</q> John iv. 1, 2, 3.</note>. He that cometh from above, is above all: he that is of the earth, is earthly, and ſpeaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven, is above all. And what he hath ſeen and heard, that he teſtifieth; and no man receiveth his teſtimony. He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeal, that God is true. For he whom God hath ſent ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by meaſure <hi>(unto him).</hi> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.

            </p>
            <p>Thus far the Evangeliſt ſeems to be relating the teſtimony of John, the ſecond Elias.</p>
            <p>In the 5th chapter (31ſt verſe) of the ſame Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt we read, that this remarkable teſtimony was afterwards referred to by Chriſt himſelf. <q>If I bear witneſs of myſelf (ſaid Chriſt) my witneſs is not true.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0189000900:120"/>
he bare witneſs unto the truth. But I receive <hi>not teſtimony from man:</hi>
               </q> — nevertheleſs our Lord condeſcended to give the Jews an opportunity of being convinced by <hi>the teſtimony of man,</hi> a man, whom they almoſt univerſally eſteemed on account of the purity of his life, which I have already ſhewn from the authority even of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> hiſtorian Joſephus.</p>
            <p>The mercy of God, therefore, is apparent in this condeſcenſion; and though our Lord himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he received not <hi>"teſtimony from man;"</hi> yet he added—<hi>"but theſe things"</hi> (relating to John's teſtimony) <hi>"I ſay, that ye might be ſaved."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then gives a moſt lively and comprehenſive (though ſhort) deſcription of the holy character of this his harbinger. <hi>"He was"</hi> (ſays our Lord) <hi>"a burning, and a ſhining light;"</hi>—and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds the Jews, that they formerly teſtified a very particular approbation of this holy perſon: <q>and ye were willing</q> (ſays he) <q>for a ſeaſon <hi>to rejoice in his light.</hi> But I have greater witneſs than that of <hi>John:</hi> for <hi>the works</hi> which the Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame works that I do, <hi>bear witneſs</hi> of me, that the Father hath ſent me. <hi>And the Father himſelf,</hi> which hath ſent me, hath borne witneſs of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor ſeen his ſhape. And ye have not <hi>his word</hi> abiding in you: for whom he hath ſent, him ye believe not. <hi>Search
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0189000900:121"/>
the Scriptures,</hi> for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which teſtify of me.</q> Thus Chriſt pointed out to the Jews three inconteſtible indications of the truth of his holy doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The teſtimony of John the Baptiſt, with which he <hi>indulged</hi> them, though the ſame might be eſteemed unneceſſary for the cauſe of him, who "<hi>receives not teſtimony</hi> from man."</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. His own <hi>mighty works,</hi> daily wrought among them, which, as he ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>bear witneſs</hi> of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And 3dly. The <hi>witneſs of the Father himſelf,</hi> though (as Chriſt expreſſed himſelf to the Jews) <q>Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor ſeen his ſhape;</q> but he ſeems plainly to direct them to that <hi>witneſs of God,</hi> which has in all ages been apparent in the accompliſhment of the <hi>word of the Lord by his prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even the unbelieving Jews themſelves pretended to believe <hi>the Scriptures,</hi> and acknowledged them to be <hi>the word of God;</hi> and therefore Chriſt referred them to the Scriptures, as being <hi>the witneſs</hi> of the Father himſelf. <hi>"Search the Scriptures,"</hi> &amp;c. But they wilfully neglected to make a right uſe of ſuch ample teſtimony; and were, therefore, inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable. "Do not think" (ſaid Chriſt) <q>that I will accuſe you to the Father: there is one that accuſeth you, <hi>even Moſes in whom ye truſt.</hi> For had ye believed Moſes, ye would have believed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0189000900:122"/>
me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not <hi>his writings,</hi> how ſhall ye believe my words?</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the very next chapter (vi. 1, 2.) the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt relates the accompliſhment of one of the circumſtances of Jacob's prophecy, as recorded by Moſes; viz.— <q>and unto him ſhall the gathering of the people be.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"After theſe things" (ſays St. John) <q>Jeſus went over the ſea of Galilee, which is the ſea of Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, and A GREAT MULTITUDE FOLLOWED HIM, <hi>becauſe they ſaw his miracles,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. And again (14th and 15th verſes) "then thoſe men" (the five thouſand perſons, who were fed by Chriſt with five barley loaves and two ſmall fiſhes) <q>when they had ſeen the miracle that Jeſus did, ſaid, This is of a truth that prophet <hi>that ſhould come into</hi> the world.

            </p>
            <p>The people of Iſrael (as Mr. Mann obſerves in his learned treatiſe de Anno Natali Chriſti, p. 4.) were not the only people that were to be <hi>gathered</hi> unto Shiloh; not one nation only is pointed at in the prophecy, <hi>but many nations.</hi> The patriarch's words were not <gap reason="foreign">

            <head>AN ANSWER TO SOME OF THE Principal Arguments uſed by Dr. W—MS IN DEFENCE OF HIS CRITICAL DISSERTATION ON ISAIAH vii. 13, 14, 15, 16, &amp;c. IN WHICH The opinions of the late Dr. SYKES, and Dr. GEORGE BENSON, concerning <hi>Accommodations</hi> of Scripture Prophecy, <hi>are briefly</hi> conſidered.</head>

               <pb facs="tcp:0189000900:127"/>AN ANSWER TO Some of the principal Arguments uſed by Dr. W—MS in Defence of his Critical Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on ISAIAH vii. 13, 14, 15, 16, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I HAVE pointed out to Dr. W—ms ſeveral miſtakes in his Critical Diſſertation on Iſaiah vii. 13, 14, 15, 16; yet he hath not thought proper to acknowledge one of them, though he has laboured to diſprove ſeveral. Some of the principal arguments which the Doctor has advanced in favour of his hypotheſis are conſidered in the following pages.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to a defence of my remarks, it may be neceſſary for me to examine a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant queſtion concerning the interpretation of Scripture prophecies, notwithſtanding that Dr. W—ms apprehends the ſame to be <q>ſufficiently <hi>and even</hi> concluſively decided already;</q> viz. Whether any "allegorical meanings, and double ſenſes of "Scripture prophecies are to be allowed?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0189000900:128"/>
               <q>It is impoſſible (ſays the Dr.) to determine when any prophecy is fulfilled, if it has more than one ſingle ſenſe. If it has two (ſays he) it may have two hundred, and all of them equally juſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For the confirmation of this ſentiment, he refers me to Dr. George Benſon's preface to the firſt volume of his paraphraſe and notes on St. Paul's Epiſtles, and to Dr. Sykes's Connexion of natural and revealed Religion, page 217, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe I have examined with as much care, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as is neceſſary, and find, that the third objection to Dr. George Benſon's hypotheſis, quoted even in his own Introduction, p. xxxiv. obliges him to make ſuch large conceſſions concerning types and figures, that—notwithſtanding his great zeal againſt double fenſes, his denying of them ſeems a mere diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in terms, and not in effect, from the general received opinion.</p>
            <p>In his anſwer to the ſaid objection, he allows, p. xxxv. <q>That, wherever the <hi>law</hi> or the <hi>Prophets</hi> have declared, that the rites and ceremonies of <hi>the Moſaic conſtitution</hi> were intended to point out a moral obligation, or to prefigure the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or ſomething in the Chriſtian diſpenſation, there that moral intention, or prophetic prefiguration, is the one, true ſenſe of the text, &amp;c.</q> See the Doctor's anſwer at length in p. xxxv.</p>
            <p>Here he plainly allows of a direct application, in ſome caſes, to the antitype; which he calls <q>the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0189000900:129"/>
one true ſenſe of the text.</q> —But how (as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man) he can poſſibly avoid acknowledging the neceſſary conſequence of this his conceſſion, I leave all candid readers to judge: for if there is an allegorical ſenſe alluding to the antitype (which he calls "a <hi>moral intention</hi> or <hi>prophetic prefiguration</hi>") there muſt certainly be, likewiſe, a <hi>literal ſenſe</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable <hi>to the type itſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed the Doctor has in that place refined his argument to ſo ſmall a thread, that it becomes almoſt imperceptible.</p>
            <p>The next objection quoted by Dr. Benſon, is as follows. — Object. IV. <q>Are not many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the New Teſtament taken from the Old Teſtament, and uſed in a quite different ſenſe from what they have, as they ſtand in the original writer? and muſt not theſe be called double ſenſes of the words of ſacred Scripture?</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Doctor anſwers, — <q>It is acknowledged, that our Lord, and his Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, have taken ſeveral paſſages from the Old Teſtament; and uſed them in a very different ſenſe from what they have, as connected with the place from whence they were taken.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But that will not prove a double ſenſe of the words. I may quote a paſſage from <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil, Herodotus</hi> or <hi>Livy,</hi> to expreſs my preſent meaning, and in quite another ſenſe from what it has in thoſe antient authors. But that will not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0189000900:130"/>
prove that thoſe antient authors intended their words ſhould be underſtood in two ſenſes. In the original intention they had only one meaning. In <hi>my accommodation of them,</hi> they have only one meaning. And though the ſame words may have different ideas affixed to them; and be uſed, by ſucceſſive ſpeakers, or writers, in various ſenſes; yet that does not prove that, in the original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, they had more than one ſignification.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now I readily allow, that Dr. Benſon's idea of <hi>an accommodation</hi> is certainly true in ſuch caſes as he has ſuppoſed, viz. in quotations from <hi>Homer or Virgil, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>To expreſs a preſent meaning in quite another ſenſe from what it has in thoſe antient authors.</q> And I as readily aſſent to a part of Dr. W—ms quotation in page 41 of his Critical Diſſertation from a very learned author, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Dr. GREGORY SHARPE.—See his ſecond argument in Defence of Chriſtianity taken from the ancient prophecies, page 349.</p>
                  <p>The ſentence which immediately follows the above extract, ought by no means to be omitted when the author's ſentiments on this head are quoted, viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But indeed to an attentive mind the difference will appear very great between the citations from prophane authors and the prophets.</q>
                  </p>
               </note> viz. that when <q>paſſages in the Grecian poets are cited, or alluded to, in the writings of the New,</q> or Old
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0189000900:131"/>
"Teſtament," the ſame <q>are not to be conſidered as prophecies.</q> For indeed they cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be eſteemed than as <q>a mere accommodation of phraſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But when the <hi>word of the Lord by his prophets,</hi> or (as St. Matthew warily expreſſes himſelf) <q>that which was <hi>ſpoken of the Lord</hi> by <hi>the prophet,</hi>
               </q> is cited by an evangeliſt, and declared <hi>to be fulfilled;</hi> the idea of "a <hi>mere accommodation</hi>" becomes highly improper, not only in a grammatical, but alſo in a religious ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in anſwer to all that has been ſaid in favour of <hi>accommodations,</hi> I muſt obſerve, that the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of proverbs and phraſes, or of quotations from poets and hiſtorians, by <hi>a ſimilarity of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> is ſo widely different from <hi>the fulfilling of a prophecy,</hi> that the true meaning of the word <hi>fulfill,</hi> when applied to the latter, cannot juſtly be aſcertained by ſuch a compariſon.</p>
            <p>The word of <hi>a prophet</hi> (eſpecially the word of the LORD by a PROPHET) implies a <hi>foretelling</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of future things, which muſt in due time be <hi>fulfilled;</hi> as <q>all things muſt <hi>be fulfilled</hi> (ſaid our Lord) which were written in the law of Moſes, and in the prophets, and in the Pſalms concerning me.</q> Luke xxiv. 44.</p>
            <p>Therefore when we are told, that <hi>"the word which was ſpoken of the Lord by the prophet" is fulfilled,</hi> we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0189000900:132"/>
cannot, either with grammatical, or religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety (as I have before obſerved) underſtand any other <hi>fulfilling or accompliſhment</hi> than that which was originally intended by the holy ſpirit to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured.</p>
            <p>Becauſe we cannot allow, that a ſcripture prophecy is <hi>accommodated</hi> 
               <q>to a particular ſenſe, to which it originally had no reference<note n="*" place="bottom">See page 40. Crit. Diſſert.</note>,</q> unleſs we allow likewiſe that ſuch <hi>an accommodation</hi> is abſolutely a <hi>perverſion</hi> of the <hi>primary</hi> ſenſe of the prophet: for readers would not only be thereby perplexed and miſled with reſpect to the true accompliſhment ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally and ſingly intended by the words of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſo cited, but would alſo be naturally led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the matters, related by the evangeliſt, were intentionally prefigured or foretold thereby, which would be a deception of no ſmall diſcredit to the evangeliſt, if his compariſon had really no other relation to the prophecy than that <q>
                  <hi>of a</hi> ſimiliarity of circumſtances.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that ſuch a miſapplication of ſcripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy cannot otherwiſe be conſidered than as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception leading to a <hi>double miſconſtruction</hi> as above; which would be as little ſuitable to the teſtimony of an evangeliſt <hi>"by way of illuſtration,"</hi> as to the original ſenſe of the prophet, whatever Dr. Benſon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0189000900:133"/>
may think of it, or Dr. W—ms either. See his Remarks, p. 40.</p>
            <p>If all this be duly conſidered, I think no one can reaſonably ſuppoſe that an evangeliſt would attempt to <hi>miſlead</hi> his readers by declaring a prophecy to be accompliſhed <hi>or fulfilled</hi> in <q>a particular ſenſe to which it <hi>originally had no reference.</hi>
               </q> See Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Diſſert. p. 40.</p>
            <p>Dr. Benſon in page xxii. of his introduction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that <q>if the iid and xvith Pſalms can be ſhown quite throughout to agree to king David, then they ought to be interpreted of him. But if (as ſome judicious perſons have thought) there be in them ſome expreſſions, which are not applicable to king David, then they ſhould be interpreted wholly concerning the Meſſiah; to whom they do, in every part, very well agree.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now I am of the ſame opinion with Dr. Benſon that theſe two Pſalms are undoubtedly to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted of the Meſſiah, and I do not at all contend for the application of them to David.</p>
            <p>I only object, therefore, to the Doctor's rule of interpretation, which he has applied to the ſaid Pſalms; becauſe I think it will be liable, in a great variety of applications, to miſlead and perplex thoſe perſons, who may happen to adopt it.</p>
            <p>For inſtance; the lxxiid Pſalm, of which he ſpeaks in the ſame page, is undoubtedly a prophecy of Chriſt's kingdom, as Dr. Benſon interprets it; yet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0189000900:134"/>
his rule ſeems to lead him into a real difficulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; becauſe he is thereby obliged to deny the leaſt reference to king Solomon; when it plainly appears by the title of the Pſalm (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>"To So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon"</hi>) that the pſalmiſt abſolutely addreſſed himſelf <hi>to Solomon,</hi> who in the beginning of his reign was manifeſtly a type of the ſpiritual Solomon or Shiloh (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> Iſaiah ix.</note>."</p>
            <p>Indeed the Doctor's rule can by no means be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, if we conſider the nature and general ſtyle of prophetical writings, and the abrupt tranſitions fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently found therein; of which I have given am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and undeniable proofs from the viith, viiith, and ixth chapters of Iſaiah. See the ſecond part of my remarks on the Critical Diſſertation.</p>
            <p>Theſe paſſages, and many others of the ſame kind, very much confirm what I have wrote (Part II. p. 23) concerning the paſſage quoted by St. Matthew from Hoſea; (viz. <q>out of Egypt have I called my ſon</q>)
and, I think, muſt prove to all conſiderate people, that Dr. Sykes (the other cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for accommodations to whom Dr. W—ms has referred me) has been much too precipitate in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (pages 230 and 231 of his Connexion of natural and revealed Religion) <q>that the prophet (in this text) is not ſpeaking of <hi>any future event:</hi>
               </q> and that the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0189000900:135"/>
term <q>fulfilled, cannot imply a prophecy of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's going into Egypt, or coming from thence:</q> &amp;c.—The ſame obſervation may with juſtice be made concerning Dr. W—ms, who boldly aſks (page 40.)—"How can it be ſaid, that any thing is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled "which was not ſpoken to be fulfilled? as in chap. ii. 15. (Matthew) <q>or not ſpoken by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, in the ſenſe in which it is cited by an evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt?</q> Alſo the Doctor declares in page 39— concerning this paſſage, that it <q>could not be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled <hi>when the</hi> child Jeſus <hi>came out of</hi> Egypt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to theſe aſſertions I muſt obſerve in the firſt place, that they cannot by any means be proved. And ſecondly, that it is moſt reaſonable to believe this text of Hoſea to be a prophecy of Chriſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtyle and conſtruction of the ſentence itſelf is ſo peculiarly adapted to the <hi>ſingle perſon</hi> of the Meſſiah, that the Seventy have thought themſelves obliged to leave the <hi>literal ſenſe</hi> of the original, in order to render it more ſuitable in their tranſlation to <hi>the people</hi> of Iſrael: all which I have before parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly noted.</p>
            <p>But there are ſtill other reaſons to be given in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of it.</p>
            <p>Though the people of Iſrael are here ſpoken of in ſuch a manner, that Dr. W—ms thinks he has ſufficient reaſon to intitle it <q>a declaration of an event long paſt;</q> yet St. Matthew expreſly quotes it as a prophecy, viz. as <q>that which was ſpoken of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0189000900:136"/>
the Lord by the prophet;</q> which expreſſion could not with any propriety be uſed, if the words of the prophet were merely an <hi>hiſtorical relation;</hi> for they could not, in that caſe, be ſaid to be <q>ſpoken of the Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it plainly appears, that there is not the leaſt room to ſuppoſe <hi>an accommodation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, notwithſtanding all that has been ſaid by Dr. Sykes, Dr. G. Benſon, and Dr. W—ms, againſt double ſenſes, it muſt unavoidably be allowed, that the <q>
                  <hi>declaration (in this place)</hi> of an event long paſt,</q> prefigured <hi>an event to come;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that <hi>this ſingle text</hi> affords an indiſputable proof of the ſubſiſtance of double ſenſes in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Though ſome Chriſtians have run into errors by turning every thing into allegory, double ſenſes, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables and types, whether they were really ſo or not; yet this is no juſt argument why we ſhould indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately reject all conſtructions of this kind.</p>
            <p>And though I contend for double ſenſes in ſome caſes, yet I am as averſe to an unneceſſary multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them as Dr. W—ms can be; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reject and proteſt againſt the Doctor's propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (in page of his MS reply to my remarks) that if a prophecy <q>has two <hi>(ſenſes)</hi> it may have two hundred; and all of them equally juſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>fulfilling of a prophecy</hi> (as I have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) muſt mean the <hi>only true accompliſhment, or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0189000900:137"/>
completion of it;</hi> ſo that it cannot juſtly be extended, or applied to any further circumſtances, than thoſe particularly and originally intended; therefore, when an evangeliſt has declared a prophecy <hi>to be fulfilled,</hi> though he may have convinced us that the prophet's words referred to are capable of bearing <hi>a double ſenſe</hi> (viz. one literal, and one allegorical or prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative, which he himſelf points out) yet, at the ſame time, he manifeſtly excludes the other 198 ſenſes, notwithſtanding that Dr. W—ms thinks <hi>"all of them equally juſt."</hi> For after a declaration is made <hi>(of indiſputable authority)</hi> that a prophecy <hi>is fulfilled,</hi> it would be, not only impertinent, but preſumptuous, to look for <hi>a further accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is neceſſary, however, for me to obſerve, that the <hi>fulfilling of ſome particular prophecies</hi> includes a conſiderable length of time, as well as a variety of circumſtances and places.</p>
            <p>Of this, I propoſe to give one remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which will afford me, at the ſame time, a proper opportunity of ſpeaking more particularly to Dr. Sykes.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, in his Connexion of natural and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, chap. x. p. 229, affirms, <q>that our Saviour, and his apoſtles, applied the term <hi>to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill,</hi> when there was only a ſimilitude of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: and (that) they cited the words of the Old Teſtament, and made uſe of that term, upon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0189000900:138"/>
the application of them, where they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to expreſs the <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of a <hi>prophecy.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>You have (ſays the Doctor) <hi>an inſtance very clear</hi> in Matthew xiii. 14, 15. where our Saviour gives the reaſon why he ſpoke to the people in parables: <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>they ſeeing ſee not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</hi> And in them is <hi>fulfilled the prophecy of Eſaias, which ſaith, by hearing ye ſhall hear, and ſhall not underſtand, and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and ſhall not perceive. For this peoples heart is</hi> waxed groſs, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have cloſed: leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes and hear with their ears, and ſhould underſtand with their hearts, and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Our Saviour (ſays the Doctor) applies theſe words to the Jews in Judea, and St. Paul, many years afterwards, applies the very ſame prophecy to the Jews at Rome.</q> 
               <q>This ſhews (continues he) that, though the term <hi>fulfill,</hi> when applied to an <hi>event foretold, does</hi> ſignify the accompliſhment of <hi>a real prophecy;</hi> yet it was uſed in caſes where there was no accompliſhment of a prediction, but only a <hi>ſimilitude of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;</hi> and conſequently, the application of the words of a prophet to a certain particular event, by w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

or that ſuch a <hi>particular event</hi> was foretold:</q> 
               <q>But the real meaning of the word muſt be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by other circumſtances; ſuch as, whether the prophet is ſpeaking of a future event or not, or, in ſhort, by thoſe means by which one knows whether the words are prophetic or not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But before all this reaſoning of Dr. Sykes be admitted, we ought carefully to examine the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or proof on which it is built.</p>
            <p>This he calls <hi>"an inſtance very clear;"</hi> but I hope to convince my readers, that it is <hi>no inſtance at all of this matter,</hi> and conſequently that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's concluſion thereupon is unjuſt.</p>
            <p>Were not the Jews one people, and deſcended from the ſame ſtock, whether they lived at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem or Rome?</p>
            <p>If this be granted (and I think the moſt zealous advocates for Dr. Sykes will not deny it) it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be allowed likewiſe, that this remarkable prophecy of Eſaias concerning them, (viz. <q>by hearing ye ſhall hear, and ſhall not underſtand,</q> &amp;c. Iſaiah vi. 10.) was <hi>manifeſtly fulfilled</hi> when the Jews rejected the doctrine of Chriſt, whether preached by himſelf at one time, or by his apoſtles at other different times.</p>
            <p>So I think I may ſafely conclude that the two <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent applications</hi> quoted by Dr. Sykes of this ſame prophecy, were not occaſioned, as he ſuppoſes, by a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0189000900:140"/>
mere <hi>"ſimilitude of circumſtances,"</hi> but by a <hi>direct accompliſhment</hi> of <hi>the prediction</hi> in <hi>both caſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as this example cannot any longer ſerve the cauſe in favour of which it was quoted by Dr. Sykes; I hope it will not be eſteemed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper example of a very <hi>different argument,</hi> and therefore I ſhall beg leave to claim it on my ſide of the queſtion, as <hi>"an inſtance very clear"</hi> of the truth of the obſervation which I made above, viz. that the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of ſome particular prophecies includes a conſiderable length of time, as well as a variety of circumſtances and places.</p>
            <p>However, I muſt not leave this text without coming to a further explanation with Dr. W—ms concerning it, becauſe he has brought a very heavy accuſation againſt me concerning the parallel account given by St. Mark, chap. iv. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>He charges me with <hi>reflecting</hi> 
               <q>ſeverely on the character of the bleſſed Jeſus,</q> by ſaying, <q>that he taught in parables, leſt they ſhould underſtand and be ſaved.</q> "Our Saviour" (ſays the Doctor) <q>gave a very different reaſon for his conduct; and Mr. S— ſhould have rendered the paſſage Mark iv. 12. agreeable to the evangeliſt's words in the 33d verſe of the ſame chapter: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhould be there tranſlated <hi>if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,</hi> as it is in 2d. Timothy ii. 25.</q> — However, I am not at all conſcious (I thank God)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0189000900:141"/>
of having in the leaſt reſpect offended againſt the character of our bleſſed Lord.</p>
            <p>Neither do I know of any <hi>ſevere reflection</hi> in this caſe, except the Doctor's <hi>own charge</hi> againſt myſelf.</p>
            <p>Whatever ſenſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may bear in other places, yet in the parallel places of St. Matthew and Mark above-mentioned, it muſt neceſſarily be conſtrued <hi>"leſt"</hi>—or to that effect: for, as the ſenſe of the context muſt confirm the true meaning of any particular word, it will be found, upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, that the Doctor's ſenſe of theſe paſſages cannot poſſibly be admitted.</p>
            <p>The words of Chriſt, according to the teſtimony of both theſe evangeliſts, point out the material diſtinction, which he then made between thoſe that were true believers, and the reprobate Jews, whom our Lord called, "them that are without" (ſee Mark iv. 11.) to the former it was <q>given to know the myſtery of the kingdom of God,</q> Matthew xiii. 11. Mark iv. 11. But to the latter, ſays St. Matthew, <hi>"it is not given."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this neceſſary diſtinction is entirely loſt by Dr. W—ms's interpretation, becauſe there is no ſuch diſtinction made in the 33d verſe of the fourth chapter of St. Mark, the ſenſe of which the Doctor propoſes to adopt; for the evangeliſt is there ſpeaking of Chriſt's preaching in general to the whole multitude, including thoſe to whom <q>it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0189000900:142"/>
was given to know,</q> as well as thoſe to whom it was "not given;" and this is certain, becauſe in the very next verſe (the 34th) we read, that afterwards, <q>
                  <hi>when they were alone,</hi> he expounded all things to his diſciples.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now it might very well be ſaid of Chriſt's preaching to the whole multitude of good and bad together, that <q>with many ſuch parables ſpake he the word unto them, as they <hi>were able to hear it;</hi>
               </q> becauſe Chriſt obſerved this ſame method, even when he taught his diſciples alone; and at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to them, ſoon before his paſſion, <q>I have yet many things to ſay unto you, but ye <hi>cannot bear them now.</hi>
               </q> John xvi. 12.</p>
            <p>But when the <hi>reprobate</hi> Jews are ſpoken of <hi>ſeparately and diſtinctly</hi> from thoſe to <hi>whom it</hi> was <hi>"given to know,"</hi> it cannot be underſtood that the word was ſpoken <q>
                  <hi>unto them as they</hi> were able to hear it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe, it is apparent, that they <hi>were never able to hear it, or bear it</hi>—according to the true ſenſe of theſe phraſes; which imply ſuch a comprehenſion of the doctrine, as may produce an aſſent or belief; otherwiſe the prophecy of Iſaiah, which Chriſt then referred to, could not have been fulfilled. <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>ſeeing, they ſee not</hi> (ſaid our Lord) and hearing, <hi>they hear not,</hi> neither do <hi>they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</hi>
               </q> (Which is very different from being ſpoken to, as Dr. W—ms would have it, <q>as they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0189000900:143"/>
                  <hi>were able to</hi> hear.</q>) <q>And in them (continued our Lord) is fulfilled the prophecy of Eſaias, which ſaith, by hearing ye ſhall hear, and <hi>ſhall not underſtand,</hi> and ſeeing, ye ſhall ſee, and <hi>ſhall not perceive.</hi>
               </q> (Therefore it is plain that St. Mark's expreſſion, chap. iv. 33. cannot be applied to theſe, when diſtinctly ſpoken of from the reſt of the congregation.) "For this people's heart" (ſaid Iſaiah) <q>is waxed groſs, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes <hi>they have cloſed, leſt</hi> at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and ſhould underſtand with their heart, and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them</q> (ſaid our Lord). The cloſing of their eyes was their own act and deed, <q>their eyes <hi>THEY</hi> have cloſed, <hi>LEST</hi> they ſhould ſee,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that there was no partiality <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>For <q>the reaſon why theſe myſteries are no more plainly delivered unto them (the Jews) is for their foregoing obſtinacy.</q> See ASSEMBLY'S ANNOT. on the ſaid text.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Hammond paraphraſes the 15th verſe to the ſame effect, viz. that <q>this is a juſt judgment of God's upon them, for their obduration and obſtinacy,</q> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Monſ. Martin likewiſe explains this to the ſame purpoſe. <q>Ceſt a dire que Dieu ſe cache a ceux qui l'ayant pu trouver ne ſe ſont pas mis en etat de le chercher, &amp; qu'il livre a leurs prejuges &amp; a leur tenebres ceux qui ont ferme les yeux a la verité.</q>
                  </p>
               </note> in their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0189000900:144"/>
they having rendered themſelves unworthy of a clearer revelation by their unwillingneſs to be converted. They rejected ſuch evidence as Chriſt was pleaſed to give them, which would have been amply ſufficient, had they not <hi>not wilfully ſhut their eyes againſt it;</hi> for St. John ſays, chap. iii. 19. <q>this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their works are evil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore they were <hi>juſtly eſteemed unworthy</hi> 
               <q>to know the myſteries of the kingdom of heaven.</q> For, "whoſoever hath" (ſaid our Lord) <q>to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance: but whoſoever <hi>hath not,</hi> from him <hi>ſhall be taken away,</hi> even <hi>that he hath.</hi> THEREFORE, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſpeak I to them in parables, becauſe they ſeeing, ſee not,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, "THEREFORE," plainly refer to the foregoing ſentence, viz. <q>
                  <hi>but whoſoever</hi> hath not — <hi>from him</hi> ſhall be taken away,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the ſcope and tenor of the argument would be entirely deſtroyed if Dr. W—ms's ſenſe of the parallel paſſage in St. Mark were to be admitted.— For Chriſt plainly intended to ſhew, that the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews would loſe even what little knowledge they had; ſo far would they be from underſtanding or receiving his parables. And the event plainly proved this; for they fell from bad to worſe, untill
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0189000900:145"/>
the total deſtruction of Jeruſalem, when <hi>the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of deſolation</hi> (ſpoken of by Daniel) was accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>St. Mark does not, indeed, expreſs the very words of the prophet Iſaiah, nor mention the quotation made of them by Chriſt, but he plainly delivers the <hi>full ſenſe of them,</hi> as they were really <hi>fulfilled</hi> in the unbelieving Jews, viz.</p>
            <p>"Unto you" (ſaid Chriſt to his diſciples) <q>it is given to know the myſtery of the kingdom of God, but unto <hi>them that are without,</hi> all theſe things are done in parables: THAT ſeeing they may ſee, <hi>and not perceive,</hi> and hearing they may hear, and <hi>not underſtand,</hi> LEST at any time they ſhould be converted, and their ſins ſhould be forgiven them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The particle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ("THAT") followed by verbs in the ſubjunctive mood (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c.) cannot poſſibly be made ſenſe of, if the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ("LEST") is tranſlated,—<hi>"if peradventure";</hi> becauſe the negative <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, "may <hi>not ſee,</hi> and <hi>may not underſtand</hi>") abſolutely leads to a different ſenſe from that propoſed by Dr. W—ms.</p>
            <p>So that it is moſt reaſonable to conclude with Dr. Hammond, that theſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <q>that ſeeing,</q>

               <q>note the obduration of the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, which fell on them from God's deſertion; as a puniſhment of their not making uſe of the

talents, which he had given them, and ſo this verſe is anſwerable, and parallel to Matthew xiii. 15, or the end of that place in Iſaiah recited, and ſet down at large in St. Matthew; but here —(and ſo alſo in Luke viii. 10. and John xii. 40.) <hi>epitomized and ſummed up, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, leſt they ſhould ſee,</hi>

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, therefore, cannot in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe places be conſtrued <hi>"if peradventure,"</hi> without deſtroying the propriety of our Lord's quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Iſaiah, delivered at length by St. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, and <hi>epitomized by St. Mark</hi> as above; for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the original prophecy, is properly rendered <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Syriac, and LEST in the Engliſh tranſlations, and cannot poſſibly bear any other ſenſe agreeable to the context; becauſe the prophet plainly foretold, that the Jews would <hi>wilfully ſhut their eyes</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <q>LEST they ſhould ſee with their eyes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, men do not uſually <hi>ſhut their eyes</hi> in order <hi>to ſee therewith,</hi> or (according to Dr. W—ms's interpretation of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>"if peradventure"</hi> they may ſee with their eyes; but rather, that they may <hi>not ſee,</hi> or, according to the propriety of the Engliſh tranſlation of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <q>LEST <hi>they ſhould ſee</hi> with their eyes,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The cloſing of the eyes, in this place, is indeed a mere figurative expreſſion for the inſenſibility and wicked obſtinacy of the Jews; yet the ſame reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0189000900:147"/>
holds good, notwithſtanding this conſideration, and ſufficiently proves, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> muſt be conſtrued <hi>negatively,</hi> and not, as Dr. W—ms propoſes, "if <hi>peradventure.</hi>"</p>
            <p>By this example we learn that ſome parables were not only difficult to thoſe reprobate unbelievers, whom St. Mark calls <hi>"them that are without,"</hi> but alſo, even to the true diſciples themſelves; who, by miſunderſtanding the parable of the ſower, and by deſiring an explanation of it (ſee 10th verſe) occaſioned this remarkable anſwer of our Lord, the purport of which is recorded in the two texts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered above.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, there were very many caſes, wherein the teaching by parables and types was (not only the ſafeſt and moſt prudent, but alſo) the ſhorteſt and cleareſt method of conveying a true idea of the propoſed doctrine, as being very ſuitable to the genius and cuſtoms of the Eaſtern nations in general, and of the Jews in particular; and alſo becauſe the types and figures themſelves would make a very deep impreſſion on the memory, and by their well known characters clearly illuſtrate the allegorical meaning.</p>
            <p>I propoſe now to reconſider the principal ſubject of my remarks, viz. the prophecy of Iſaiah con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the birth of Immanuel.</p>
            <p>Dr. W—ms has aſſerted (page 44.) <q>that the evangeliſt only alludes to the paſſage in Iſaiah,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0189000900:148"/>
becauſe it was <hi>remarkably ſuitable</hi> to the matter which he was relating.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This occaſioned my queſtion to the Doctor, viz. <q>If <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does not ſignify a virgin, in what ſenſe can the text be eſteemed <hi>remarkably ſuitable</hi> to the miraculous conception <hi>of a virgin</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt? And in what manner could the <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of it</hi> to that ſingular event aſſiſt the ſacred hiſtorian (as he ſuppoſes) <hi>by way of illuſtration?</hi>
               </q> See Part I. page 39.</p>
            <p>I afterwards obſerve, that the Doctor <q>has taken great pains to make the text <hi>remarkably unſuitable,</hi> by inſinuating that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the YOUNG WOMAN (as he conſtrues it) ſpoken of in the text, was ſo far from being a <hi>virgin,</hi> that ſhe was <hi>with child,</hi> even at the time when ſhe was pointed at (as he deviſes in p. 31.) by the prophet.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which the Doctor replies, <q>had St. Matthew alluded to the birth of this child, it would have been <hi>very unſuitable.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now this conceſſion is ſufficient for my purpoſe, becauſe the Doctor's inſinuation, that the evangeliſt alluded only <hi>"to the name Immanuel,"</hi> and not to the other circumſtances related by the prophet, muſt appear entirely groundleſs, when we conſider the words of St. Matthew.</p>
            <p>For though the evangeliſt interpreted the name <hi>Immanuel,</hi> yet this does not prove, that he referred
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0189000900:149"/>
merely to <hi>this name,</hi> but rather, that no other perſon but the Meſſiah himſelf could properly be intitled, <hi>"God with us;"</hi> and conſequently that he eſteemed the words of Iſaiah to be really a prophecy, and ſuch a one as could not be <hi>fulfilled,</hi> except in Chriſt alone, who was truly <hi>"God with us."</hi> But farther—The evangeliſt's manner of introducing the quotation very clearly ſhews, that <hi>this name</hi> was not the only thing he intended to allude to.</p>
            <p>For he ſays— <q>NOW ALL THIS WAS DONE— (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) that it might <hi>be fulfilled</hi> which was ſpoken <hi>of the Lord by the prophet,</hi> behold A VIRGIN <hi>ſhall be with child,</hi> and ſhall <hi>bring forth a ſon,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The words "ALL THIS WAS DONE" muſt refer to the relation before given, concerning the miraculous conception of <hi>the virgin Mary</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore the prophecy of Iſaiah, that A VIRGIN ſhould <hi>conceive,</hi> and <hi>bear a ſon, was ſuitable,</hi> not in <hi>the name only</hi> (as Doctor W—ms has inſinuated) <hi>but</hi> in <hi>the whole quotation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another objection is made, <q>that the birth of a child from a virgin is a fact of ſuch a nature, as not to admit of proof.</q> "It is a fact" (ſays the Doctor) <q>
                  <hi>which in the</hi> very nature of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a ſign to <hi>any</hi> perſon <hi>but the mother.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the Scriptures inform us that <hi>this ſign</hi> was clearly proved (i. e. the wonderful event that <hi>a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0189000900:150"/>
virgin had conceived,</hi> was known with abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty) even <hi>before</hi> the birth of the Meſſiah; and this, not merely by the teſtimony <hi>of the mother,</hi> but by other very ſufficient authorities; which rendered the ſign as apparent and indubitable, as any other ſign that was ever given, even the moſt ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>For after the angel Gabriel had revealed to the virgin Mary, that ſhe (although a virgin) ſhould "conceive and bring forth a ſon;" St. Luke i. 31.) the ſame thing was confirmed to her by her couſin Elizabeth in the hill country of Judea.</p>
            <p>"Bleſſed is ſhe that believed" (ſaid Elizabeth filled with the Holy Ghoſt) <q>for there ſhall be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe things which were told her from the Lord.</q> Luke i. 45.</p>
            <p>See the whole ſalutation, and the teſtimony of John the Baptiſt, though himſelf at that time only a babe in the womb; which clearly proves that the abſolute knowledge of the fact was not confined to the <hi>virgin mother alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards an angel was ſent from God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Joſeph from putting away his eſpouſed wife on account of her being with child; and the angel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him before the time, that ſhe ſhould <q>bring forth a ſon;</q> and, that he might the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually convince him of his wife's purity and virtue, he aſſured him, ſaying, <q>that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghoſt.</q> (Matt. i. 20.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0189000900:151"/>Therefore, though <q>the birth of a child from a virgin</q> is by Dr. W—ms eſteemed <q>a fact of ſuch a nature as not to admit of proof;</q> yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is impoſſible with God, who was pleaſed to give theſe indubitable proofs of the long promiſed ſign, even whilſt the child Jeſus was in the womb, which muſt entirely obviate the Doctor's objection, that <hi>"this cannot be a ſign to any perſon but the mother."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fulneſs of time the ſign was manifeſted in the moſt extraordinary manner.</p>
            <p>An angel, accompanied with a multitude of the heavenly hoſt, proclaimed the wonderful birth to the ſhepherds in the field; and a ſtar pointed out to the eaſtern ſtrangers the place where the young child lay.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly this wonderful circumſtance, that A VIRGIN HAD BROUGHT FORTH A SON, would, in a little time, be as well known to <hi>the houſe of David,</hi> as theſe miraculous manifeſtations and confirmations of the ſaid ſupernatural birth; eſpecially as the family of Joſeph, the bleſſed virgin's huſband, was <hi>the chief branch of that royal ſtock,</hi> lineally deſcended from Zorobabel, and ſo from the ſon of Jeſſe.</p>
            <p>There is ſtill another difficulty with Dr. W—ms. <q>I cannot perceive (ſays he) <hi>what event</hi> the birth of Immanuel could be a ſign of, unleſs it <hi>could be a ſign of itſelf?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But is it really poſſible, that Dr. W—ms <q>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive,</q> that the miraculous birth of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0189000900:152"/>
true Immanuel was a ſign of ſomething more than that event itſelf?</p>
            <p>Was it not a ſign to all thoſe, who then waited for <hi>"the conſolation and redemption of Iſrael,"</hi> (Luke ii. 25.) that the <hi>kingdom of God</hi> was <hi>nigh at hand?</hi> (Matthew xii. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <note n="*" place="bottom">"But if I caſt out devils by the Spirit of God, then <hi>the kingdom</hi> of <hi>God is come</hi> unto you."</note> Luke x. 9.11. <note n="†" place="bottom">"And ſay unto them, the kingdom of God <hi>is come</hi> nigh unto you.—Notwithſtanding be ye ſure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."</note>.)</p>
            <p>Was it not a ſign to <hi>Joſeph, and others of the houſe of David,</hi> that a child, ſo born, muſt be the long promiſed Meſſiah of the <hi>ſeed of David,</hi> to whom <hi>the kingdom was to be reſtored,</hi> and in whom (according to Iſaiah's promiſe to his cotemporaries of <hi>the houſe of David</hi>) it was to be eſtabliſhed for ever? See Iſaiah ix. 6, 7. 2 Sam. vii. 16.</p>
            <p>But, I find, it is in vain that I urge to Dr. W—ms the accompliſhment of the ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies concerning the eſtabliſhment of the <q>kingdom of David</q> in Chriſt; for the Doctor ſtill ſeems to perſiſt in his former notion that Nathaniel <q>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under a miſtake</q> in calling Chriſt <q>king of Iſrael.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He hopes to evade the point by alledging, that <q>not only Nathaniel and the diſciples, but the whole Jewiſh nation did actually labour under a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0189000900:153"/>
great miſtake about <hi>the nature</hi> of the Meſſiah's kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he would lead me to a very different queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but I am aware, that though the diſciples did, for ſome time, <hi>"labour under a miſtake,"</hi> as the Doctor obſerves, concerning <q>the nature of the Meſſiah's kingdom;</q> yet there was <hi>not the leaſt miſtake,</hi> in thoſe who truly believed, concerning the main point in queſtion, viz. whether or not the Meſſiah <hi>was really a king?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding that our Lord rejected all the temporal authority of a worldly king, and declared, that his kingdom was not of this world, he was nevertheleſs really a king, <hi>"king of Iſrael"</hi> (as Nathaniel called him) and king of Judah, or (which is the ſame thing) <hi>"king of the Jews;"</hi> for even Pilate himſelf ſeemed convinced of Chriſt's juſt right to the title of <hi>king,</hi> though, like a thorough-paced time ſerver, he preferred his own temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to all other conſiderations, and delivered up THE KING OF KINGS (Rev. xvii. 14.) to be ſlain, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be A KING; for his anſwer to the chief prieſts, concerning the title intended to be affixed to the croſs, plainly ſhews, that he was conſcious of this.</p>
            <p>Dr. W—ms charges me with having <q>brought a vaſt number of texts to prove, not (my) aſſertion, that Jeſus was ever called the king of Judah, but the truth of (his) aſſertion,</q> &amp;c. concerning the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0189000900:154"/>
miſtake of Nathaniel. And he ſays, <q>this will be evident to every one who conſults the paſſages cited by me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But if the Doctor will pleaſe once more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the paſſages himſelf, he will find, that ſeveral among them are prophecies which were abſolutely fulfilled in our Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I hope, he will not venture to aſſert, that the prophets likewiſe <hi>"laboured under a miſtake,"</hi> when they proclaimed theſe titles of the glorious Meſſiah; or that the diſciples, and all other Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians even to this day ſtill "labour <hi>under a miſtake</hi>" in applying them to Chriſt, in whom alone they were, or could be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; ſhout O daughter of Jeruſalem: behold THY KING <hi>cometh unto thee:</hi>
               </q> the prophet then proceeds to deſcribe <hi>this coming of</hi> THE KING <hi>of Zion and Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo as exactly to correſpond with the evangeliſt's account (Luke xix. 37, 38.) of Chriſt's publick entry into Jeruſalem, when <q>the whole multitude of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples began to rejoice and praiſe God with a loud voice, for all the <hi>mighty works</hi> that they had ſeen: ſaying, <hi>bleſſed be</hi> THE KING <hi>that cometh</hi> in the <hi>name of the Lord,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. For he was certainly <hi>a king</hi> even when he rode upon the aſs, which is proved by the continuation of Zechariah's prophecy (ix. 9.) whereby he points out the character and appearance of <hi>the king of Zion and Jeruſalem</hi> mentioned in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0189000900:155"/>
beginning of the ſame verſe; "he is juſt" (ſaid the prophet) <q>and having ſalvation, lowly, and riding upon an aſs, and upon a colt the foal of an aſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So the prophet Micah declared, that out of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem Ephratah</hi> ſhould <q>he come forth that is to be <hi>ruler in Iſrael,</hi> whoſe goings forth have been from of old from everlaſting.</q> (chap. v. 2.)</p>
            <p>The event proved the truth of the prophet's words, as well as of the evangeliſt's citation (Matt. ii. 5 and 6.) for the holy one that was born at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was afterwards undoubtedly <hi>"ruler in Iſrael,"</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſſolution of that people from an united na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: of which (beſides the power of his teaching and his mighty works) his publick entry into Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and the authority ſhewn by him in clearing the temple, are remarkable proofs.</p>
            <p>That Chriſt was "a <hi>ruler in Iſrael</hi>" is implied in the preceding words of the ſame prophet (Micah v. 1.) <q>they ſhall <hi>ſmite the judge of Iſrael</hi> with a rod upon the cheek.</q> A <hi>ruler</hi> and a <hi>judge</hi> are ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous terms; and it is certain that Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>judgment</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and want of faith—condemning them (with reſpect to their <hi>temporal eſtate</hi>) to a horrid deſtruction and deſolation <note n="*" place="bottom">St. Matthew, chap. xxiv.</note>: and as all this was moſt punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fulfilled <note n="†" place="bottom">See Joſephus's account of the Jewiſh War.</note> upon them, it is certain likewiſe, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0189000900:156"/>
the ſame <hi>"judge of Iſrael"</hi> whom they ſmote upon the cheek, will <hi>one day judge them,</hi> alſo, in their <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate,</hi> as well as all their unhappy deſcendants who perſiſt in the ſame unbelief.</p>
            <p>If theſe prophecies were really <hi>fulfilled</hi> in Jeſus, they moſt certainly prove, that the Meſſiah was (as he ever will be) A KING, and conſequently that his diſciples were not miſtaken in calling him ſo, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they might miſunderſtand the <hi>nature</hi> of his kingdom.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Doctor's reply upon this point can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be eſteemed a proof of any thing more than of his own great unwillingneſs to acknowledge, that he himſelf (inſtead of Nathaniel) <hi>labours under a miſtake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another remarkable excuſe, which the Doctor has offered in behalf of his hypotheſis, deſerves par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to my remarks on Canticles vi. 8. (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the particular diſtinction there made of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins from queens and concubines) the Doctor replies, that <q>
                  <hi>Hebrew poetry is not ſo well underſtood</hi> as to enable (me) to determine that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Canticles vi. 8. is not uſed in ſtead of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>for the ſake of metre.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This unexpected turn of thought may, perhaps, be eſteemed ingenious, but it is far from ſatisfactory; for if criticks were allowed to ſubſtitute the ſenſe of one word for another, whenever their arguments are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0189000900:157"/>
reduced to that neceſſity, it would be but a vain taſk to diſpute with them; and a confuſion of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, like that of the builders of Babel, muſt neceſſarily ſucceed their perverſion of words.</p>
            <p>In Engliſh poetry the Doctor may produce as many inſtances of ſuch ſubſtitutions as he pleaſes, and he may reſt aſſured, that I ſhall never think it worth my while to attempt a confutation of them.</p>
            <p>But when ſuch refined criticiſms are applied to any part of Holy Scripture, I think, they ought not by any means to be admitted, unleſs the authors of them ſhall be able to prove, that it is more juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to adapt the Scriptures to our own private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, than our opinions to the Scriptures.</p>
