            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN I rambled into Dorſetſhire in the ſummer of 1791, my only introduction to your acquaintance was your own frank affability, and my ſole recommendation to your hoſpitable roof, that I was a ſtranger. By your good-natured politeneſs, my mind was cheered in the ſolitudes of Lulworth, and by your many friendly and kind offices I was furniſhed with informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a place where all was novelty,
<pb facs="tcp:0605200600:4"/>though my firſt charm there was the certainty of what I had ſuppoſed to be common in England, a pious and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent clergyman; and though I could, previous to my viſits at Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frith, boaſt the honour of having ſtood before the great gates of a biſhop's palace; yet, for the comforts I there enjoyed in the little parlour of a country parſonage-houſe, accept this trifling teſtimony of well-remembered goodneſs to,</p>

                  <l>He had his learning in a laughing—ſchool.</l>

I in a phaeton for New-market, juſt run a horſe at Blandford—loſt—beſt of the fun, I'm at this moment a priſoner in the King's Bench.</p>

                     <p>Why you may ſuppoſe, George, that my expences far exceeded my uncle's allowance—thought to help out by a lucky hit now and then, ſo bought a blood mare, had her put in training, then entered for the plate at Blandford—a beautiful thing—the crack of the caurſe—but before the meeting, a few poſitive mechanical raſcals thruſt me into the King's Bench—muſt go to Blandford though, ſo procured the rules, and in hopes the turf could bring me in money enough to pay my debts, off I ſpank'd for Dorſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and, ſpite of informers, appeared on the courſe. The opinion ſeemed all in favour of my mare; but, like a curſed green horn, I withdrew her from the plate, and made a by-match to run her againſt Lord Skelter's ſour-crout, to ride ourſelves—but after the firſt round, my infernal groom told me I carried too much weight, ſlung part away, came in firſt; but my Lord inſiſting on our being again weighed, I was too light by a pound and an half, ſo that though I won, I loſt the race; two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to my Lord; in ſhort, every guinea of a full
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0605200600:23"/>five hundred that an honeſt methodiſt preacher, my landlord in the rules, raiſed to equip me for the expedition.</p>
