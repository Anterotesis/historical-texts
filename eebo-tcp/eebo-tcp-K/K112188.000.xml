            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>In your Walk to St. <hi>J—</hi>'s-<hi>ſtreet,</hi> there is neither Engliſh, Senſe, nor Grammar; and your beſt Pieces of Poetry are but Trifles.</p>

               <p>I can receive no Honour from your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments.—You have by good Fortune indeed wrote one Piece that has ſold, but more from the Popularity of the Subject, than the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0394000100:9"/>
your beſt Scenes of Love are notoriouſly worſe than thoſe of the loweſt Poet in this or any other Age.—The few Similies are no way adapted, and really appear like Flowers in a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill.—In your other Poetical Writings all the Beauties are borrow'd: If we diveſt you of your Thefts, you'll reſemble the Crow in the Fable, and little will remain but Froth and Rhime.</p>

               <p>You may compliment your Genius as you pleaſe, and your Friends may give it out, but I ſhall take Liberty to affirm that 'tis far from being a perfect one in Poetry: A perfect Genius is capable of producing a finiſh'd Piece of the greateſt Length, which is what you will never be Maſter of.—A few good Lines I confeſs you ſometimes happen to write, but more from a <hi>Flaſhy Wit,</hi> than a true <hi>Native Genius.</hi>

               <p>My Genius is eminently conſpicuous in every thing I do—Can you peruſe any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of mine, where I don't ſtrike out with a ſurprizing Strength of Poetical Fury?—And in my Odes, my Flights are very Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>

               <p>Your Talent is Calumny, Brother, tho' prepoſterouſly mix'd with Panegyrick.—You can condemn and praiſe even the ſame thing, and at ſuch times as it merits neither your Cenſure, nor Approbation.—You can lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon your beſt Friends, and abuſe your greateſt Benefactors, in their Abſence; and, ſupported by a Gameſter, you think to Bully Mankind.</p>
