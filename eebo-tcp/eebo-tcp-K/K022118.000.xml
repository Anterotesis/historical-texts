            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO WILLIAM STRAHAN, Eſq.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE late Mr. David Hume hath left to your care, the publication of his poſthumous papers. As there is every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe they turn upon ſimilar reſearches with ſuch as
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0673203200:4"/>
have been already printed; or, as it is more likely, they may carry his philoſophy ſtill nearer to that point, which he might not think it diſcreet to puſh too vigorouſly in his life-time, the critical and Chriſtian clamour, no doubt, will be raiſed afreſh againſt him. It is well known, Sir, that you were conſidered by Mr. Hume, in a much higher light than that of a mere publiſher. There was, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, a mixture of truſt and tenderneſs, as well as a good opinion of you, <hi>officially,</hi> blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the idea of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection.
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0673203200:5"/>
His memory, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the honours or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces which ſhall hereafter at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, muſt, in a particular manner, intereſt and affect you. As he was your "moſt <hi>excellent friend,"</hi> his friendſhip, and the virtues which produced it, are, I truſt, "never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten."</p>
            <p>Dr. Adam Smith hath ſigned his name to a letter, at the cloſe of which, he thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely ſums up the character of Mr. Hume.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0673203200:6"/>
"I have always, conſidered him, both in his life-time and ſince his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly wiſe and virtuous man, as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit."</p>
            <p>It has been long imagined, that, perſons who were tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in any degree with that philoſophy, which Mr. Hume was ſuppoſed to favour, could not poſſibly have any title to ſuch a character, as is here drawn by Dr. Smith. That
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0673203200:7"/>
gentleman, however, hath, with a commendable fortitude, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, the virtues of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed friend.—The object of the following pages, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of that aſſertion, as well as a philoſophical plea for the juſtice on which it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Three other views, however, are connected with the deſign of this Apology. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal knowledge of Mr. Hume; ſome expectation of the popular cenſure, which, will ſoon be revived againſt him, if not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0673203200:8"/>
his affectionate Dr. Smith, and a wiſh I have long entertained to have a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of introducing ſuch ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on the moſt atrocious ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of diſſimulation as will be found, in the courſe of the work, are all arguments which have had a ſhare in making it public.</p>
            <p>My thoughts have, indeed, been thrown upon <hi>paper</hi> in haſte; yet they are, by no means, haſty thoughts; but, have reſulted from contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the death of Mr. Hume,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0673203200:9"/>
ſome months before it actually happened.—In ſhort, Sir, it is conceived, theſe remarks, upon the Life, Death, Conſiſtency, and Philoſophy, of David Hume, may, very properly, precede any new edition of his works,—may, likewiſe, do ſome ſervice to the writer, and ſome to the man; place truth and the affectation of it, like the ſun and its ſhadow, in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſide by ſide, in order to ſhew the ſplendour of one, and the mockery of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0673203200:10"/>
As to yourſelf, Sir, it would be an inſult upon your feelings, not to ſuppoſe every thing of this nature is acceptable.</p>

            <head>PRELIMINARY ADDRESS.</head>
            <p>READER, be not ſtartled, at the title of this performance. It means no ill either to you or your religion, of whatever caſt that religion may be. The Apology here offered to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, that truth, or Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0673203200:12"/>
itſelf would not, of their own accord, admit. I beſeech you to peruſe theſe detached thoughts from the beginning to the end; and indulge the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of the pauſer, reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you determine upon any of the ſubjects here treated, with that liberality which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the independent ſpirit of ſcientific enquiry, in a free ſtate. An Apology, for the philoſophy of the metaphyſical Mr. Hume, appears to denote in this ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious age, to be either ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe, or difficult, or elſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0673203200:13"/>
and deiſtical. From this work, fear neither of theſe. It is written without profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or irreverence. It promotes all morality flowing from all faiths, and it corrects all hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, wherever it is detected. The proſtitution of Chriſtianity, or, in other words, the Chriſtian religion made uſe of as a cloak to cover the moſt irreligious purpoſes, is more fatal to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governor of the world, and to his ſubordinate creatures, than a much greater latitude of principle than was indulged by
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0673203200:14"/>
Mr. Hume. Avowed Atheiſm itſelf, is not half ſo bad, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed deception, eſpecially when it takes refuge under the plauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unſuſpected robe of Chriſtian profeſſors. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſomething, betwixt ſuperſtition, and Popery pleads in favour of this worſt ſpecies of enormity; for which reaſon, it is leſs chaſtiſed than any other. Common minds, which are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly trammeled by any ſhallow ſignals of authority, are afraid of yielding to the ſuggeſtions of their own underſtanding, and
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0673203200:15"/>
ſo the evil is permitted, through mere vulgar cowardice, to ariſe, till the effects of the miſchief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come almoſt irreparable. Hence it is, alſo, that the truth of a whole library, were it cloſely analyzed, and then conſolidated to the excluſion of every thing adventitious, and imaginary,—the whole amount of matter of fact, with reſpect to things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, would be reduced to a few ſcanty volumes; or, at moſt, ſupply the ſhelves of a ſmall book-caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0673203200:16"/>
Having a due veneration for the rights of the preſs, I have here, I hope, not unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ventured to inveſtigate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or rather, to ſtart hints, which a puſilanimity, very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to candid enquiry, hath commonly paſſed over. I have ſtarted matters, which it is to be wiſhed, were more philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally purſued by ſome able hand, and I am not without hope that what is here rudely ſketched, will be formed into a correcter ſyſtem by a maſterly writer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0673203200:17"/>
In the mean time, what is offered in the ſubſequent pages, however it may offend the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, will not be ill received by thoſe who are liberal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent.</p>

               <p>DAVID HUME is dead! Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were the pillars of Orthodoxy ſo deſperately ſhaken, as they are now, by that event. It was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every thing that contradicts the general prophecy concerning it. He hath proved himſelf, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0673203200:19"/>
to a contrary opinion, one of thoſe rare characters, which ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom adorn either this, or any other country; to wit, an <hi>uniform Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</hi> He is one of the few, who died in the practice of precepts, which he laid down in the earlieſt periods of a ſpeculative life. The laſt ſcene is lately painted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and every touch of it correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds, corroborates, and confirms thoſe which preceded it. He took up the pen, to prove his conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, at a criſis, commonly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by men, the moſt alarming and pathetic. Air, phyſic, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and the alleviating ſolicitudes of friendſhip, were all tried, and were all ineffectual: even adulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0673203200:20"/>
which is ſo ſeldom unwelcome, either to the ſick, or healthy, was not able to ſeduce our philoſopher into the hope of an exiſtence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted beyond the limits of a few months.—"I happened to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his room," ſaid one of his moſt reſpectable friends, "when he was reading a letter, ſent him by Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Edmondſtone, who had written an eternal adieu to him, and which, Mr. Hume immediately ſhewed to me: I told him, that, though I was ſenſible how very much he was weakened, and that appearances, in many reſpects, were very bad, yet his chearfulneſs was ſtill ſo great, the ſpirit of life ſeemed ſtill to be ſo very ſtrong in him, that, I could
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0673203200:21"/>
not help entertaining ſome faint hopes. He anſwered, "Your hopes are groundleſs. An habitual diarr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoea of more than a year's ſtanding, would be a very bad diſeaſe at any age; at <hi>my</hi> age, it is a mortal one. When I lie down in the evening, I feel myſelf weaker, than when I roſe in the morning; and when I riſe in the morning, weaker than when I lay down in the evening. I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, beſides, that ſome of my vital parts are affected, ſo that I <hi>muſt</hi> ſoon die."</p>
               <p>I have admitted this extract, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it marks, in the moſt vivid colours, the invariable, practical, conſiſtency of Hume to his own
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0673203200:22"/>
theory. Thoſe, to whom that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory is obnoxious, wiſhed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a very different deportment of its author in his laſt moments; the more eſpecially, if thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were paſt (which was the caſe) under the declinings of a diſorder that ſhould waſte the body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impairing the mind. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who maintained oppoſite, and what is eſteemed, correcter tenets, imagined, that all the ſubtlety of a ſcepticiſm, avowed in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of gay and glowing youth; and of arguments to ſupport them, written when the pulſe was full, among the ardours of ſcience, and for the ſake of ſingularity,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0673203200:23"/>
would, upon the bed of a lingering diſtemper, all fly off, as the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of diſſolution became apparent, and leave their author in the agonies of terror-ſtruck repentance, or in the horrors of overwhelming deſpair. I, myſelf, know one perſon, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and he ſtill living, and not unknown in the Chriſtian world, who prognoſticated the moſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical exit to David Hume,—"Take my word for it, ſir," ſaid he, one day to me, "the triumph of that man, (meaning Hume) is ſhort-lived. He breaks apace: from an almoſt athletic corpulency, he is, within a few months, ſhrunk into the very ſhadow of himſelf. I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0673203200:24"/>
hear he ſtill affects his accuſtomed gaiety, and perſiſts in his unchriſtian principles: but this conduct will wear away in proportion as he gets worſe and worſe. As Dean Swift ſtands upon record the victim of diſappointment, pique, pride, ill-nature, ſo, I foreſee, will David Hume be a mournful example of that vain, and vicious philoſophy, which he hath long had the audacity to eſpouſe. Methinks, I already ſee him, ſir, in the extremity; tortured at once, by the, laſhes of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and labouring to continue life, that he may publicly give the lie to his former horrible documents. Poor wretch—I pity him, I could almoſt wiſh his prayer granted,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0673203200:25"/>
that he might do ſome juſtice to poſterity; and, in that juſtice, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiate the wrath, the omnipotent wrath, which muſt neceſſarily be kindled againſt him. Inſtead of which,—ſhocking reverſe,—obſerve him ſtruggling at the ſame time with death, and with a thorough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of having miſguided man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; of having endeavoured to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the foundation of religion—and of meriting deteſtation."</p>
               <p>In all the phrenzy of a fiery zeal, bordering, I fear, ſomewhat upon bigotry, did a celebrated <hi>Chriſtian</hi> author, as near as I can recollect, in theſe words, foretell the miſeries of David Hume; and in the ſame fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror

of language, hath he, doubtleſs, been treated, by many others. On the peruſal of that pamphlet, which ſtates the accounts of his laſt illneſs, and all the concomitant circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that attended it, I ſhould like much, as a matter of curioſity only, to know the unaffected ſtate of <hi>their</hi> feelings: their prophecy is, at all events, unfulfilled: and, what is worſe, all the <hi>minute</hi> articles (which are generally the moſt mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) rather add to, than deduct from, the great aggregate of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation.</p>

public enemies, at leaſt in a literary and ſcientific ſenſe, it is worth while to take a view of ſome of thoſe points, which prove him, beyond the poſſibility of a diſpute, to be at leaſt a <hi>ſincere believer in his own ſentiments.</hi> Many, indeed, will think, that this, however perſpicuouſly proved, will be doing him no real honour; ſince, in proportion to the clearneſs of the evidence upon this matter, it will only ſhew his impiety and obſtinate inſidelity the plainer; thereby, in the end, incurring upon him a more general diſgrace. I am of a different opinion. The terms In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, Impiety, and Atheiſin, ſhould not be laviſhly truſted from the lip. We ſhould not preſume

               <p>But, it is leſs the deſign of theſe papers to <hi>defend</hi> Hume's principles, than to ſhew, upon the beſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that he was earneſt in what he wrote, and that, through every part of his life, even to the very moment of his death, he made precept and practice go, amicably, hand in hand together. Firſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, be it obſerved, that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might be the force of his <hi>faith;</hi> no one, it is conjectured, will charge him with having neglected <hi>good works.</hi> I do not pretend to ſay how far thoſe <hi>are,</hi> or are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0673203200:29"/>
                  <hi>not</hi> ſufficient. Such enquiries are digreſſive from my ſubject. At the ſame time, I could wiſh (and ſure it is but a reaſonable requeſt) that, for theſe, he may have a proper <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of credit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps, it is one of the very worſt circumſtances againſt the cauſe of Chriſtianity, that, very few of its profeſſors were ever, either ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſo humane, or could ſo phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophically govern their <hi>paſſions,</hi> as the ſceptical David Hume. The ſimple dictates of this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's own heart, unaſſiſted by thoſe examples, and ſacred ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are ſuppoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0673203200:30"/>
univerſal "love and good will amongſt men," inſpired him to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe all the duties, decencies, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. Thus Hume the Unbeliever, as he hath been called, led a life that might even, when ſcrutinized by the eye of malevolence itſelf, call a bluſh into the cheeks of thoſe, who would fain be thought, in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of men, to be <hi>ſteadfaſt and immoveable in the faith.</hi> It is not a little ſhocking to thinking people, to perceive that the ſpirit of hypocriſy ſo generally gone forth; and it is ſtill worſe, to ſee <hi>that</hi> hypocriſy (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the aſſurance of a late lord) ſo generally ſucceſsful and carry all before it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0673203200:31"/>
It demands, alas! no ſearch into the records of antiquity, to prove that, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world proſecutes this duplicity with a vigour, to which the ſceptic Hume never had the infamy to ſtoop. I do not ſay this is an argument to deſtroy, or to invalidate the faith of Chriſtians; but I <hi>will</hi> take upon me to ſay, it is a dreadful ſymptom of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundneſs in its profeſſors, and friends, when they ſo commonly ſkulk behind the holy ſhield of their religion, as a <hi>hiding place</hi> from the eyes of the world, whenever they have a mind to do any thing in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition to its moſt obvious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0673203200:32"/>
and elementary principles. Either the religion is ſomewhere defective in itſelf, (which I, by no means, think ſo likely as the alternative) or elſe the votaries themſelves have a much worſe opinion of its <hi>real</hi> origin than ſceptics; becauſe, were not one of theſe, or perhaps, a mixture of them both, the <hi>fact,</hi> ſurely they could not, ſo much oftener than thoſe ſceptics, act in general defiance of its maxims. I, however, principally confine myſelf to that miſerable hypocriſy, which hath ſo very frequently been <hi>diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> amongſt the votaries of this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able religion; and, in particular, ſuch of them as have gained the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0673203200:33"/>
greateſt popularity, by an oftentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſplay of it. I beg theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents may not be thought to have any tendency to hurt the Chriſtian religion, of whoſe excellence I am not now to treat; yet, till ſome of its profeſſors can, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of <hi>faith and good works,</hi> back'd by the proſpect of <hi>futurity,</hi> ſurpaſs, or at leaſt equal, the virtues of a man who was tender, friendly, generous, and ſocial; let theſe vain glorious boaſters have the modeſty to hold their tongues, and ſpeak nothing; ſince nothing can be ſpoken, but to their diſgrace.—It is to the honour of David Hume, then, that he was no <hi>hypocrite</hi> in philoſophy; and that, unlike the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0673203200:34"/>
many <hi>detected</hi> hypocrites in <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> he acted as he wrote, and wrote no more than, at all times, he actually felt.</p>
               <p>This may be evidenced more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately, when we run our eye over that poſthumous paper, which he hath, very characteriſtically, called, <hi>A Funeral Oration.</hi> Prior to this, I would juſt turn an old ſubject on a new ſide: I would make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or two, on that ſhameful ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of deluſion, which, arrayed in the fair and unſuſpicious robes of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy, makes the moſt fatal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations upon ſociety; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, does infinitely more miſchief than the moſt daring and declared infidelity.</p>

               <head>SECTION II. OF RELIGIOUS HYPOCRISY.</head>
               <p>ONE of the diſtinguiſhing fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by which we mark the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age, is religious Hypocriſy, or that abominable <hi>prudery</hi> in Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, which, from the lip out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, deceives the ſhallow mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, who miſtake it for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious ſcruples of moral ſanctity. A philoſopher, who looks into the heart, and can trace many of its manoeuvres to their ſource; whoſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0673203200:36"/>
acquaintance with life, and whoſe ſkill in detecting the chicane of men, ſees, clearly, at a ſingle glance, that the whole apparatus of external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, is only a political veil thrown over the real feelings and propenſities of nature: this fallacy, to his penetrating eye, is ſufficiently obvious; he detects the cheat in a moment, and, did he not know how eaſily the major part of mankind were diſpoſed to favour <hi>that</hi> which ſuits equally their own purpoſes of impoſing upon each other (by which means the Hypocriſy be comes general), he would wonder how thoſe, who are ſuppoſed to ſtand at the top of rarefied and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalized matter, could be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0673203200:37"/>
the bubbles of imagination. Bubbles, however, they notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly are, in defiance of the very feelings which contradict their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanical pretenſions. This duplicity hath <hi>ever</hi> exiſted in life, and hath now crept into <hi>letters.</hi> There is a ſet of writers, who affect a chaſtity of ſentiment, and a kind of primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive preciſeneſs in ſtyle, with a view of paſſing upon the ſuperficial part of the public (which is infinitely the larger part) as orthodox mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts, and the moſt zealous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of Chriſtian rectitude, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious is the catalogue of authors, whoſe performances are read and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, upon this very principle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0673203200:38"/>
Hence it is, that, literary reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like almoſt every other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, is, in theſe times, merely empirical. It is, nevertheleſs, not unamuſing to a philoſopher,—when he hath a mind to relieve himſelf from the labour of ſeverer thinking, with the petty concealments of the buſy and more vacant world,—to overturn, with a calmneſs pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to his collected character, the ſuperficial ſyſtems of theſe <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious impoſtors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I have felt myſelf in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that diſpoſes to ſuch pleaſant paſtime; when I can deſcend from worthier ſciences, to the little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns which men have upon each
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0673203200:39"/>
other, I have totally deſtroyed the whole web of Hypocriſy, and diſcovered, in plauſible maxims, more tendencies to vice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, or <hi>elſe more inſincerity,</hi> than in any writings of avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed luxury and licentiouſneſs. Our modern moraliſts, eſpecially of the ſacred order, have the art of making Virtue terrible, and Vice an object of indifference: like an unſkilful painter, they disſigure the native amiableneſs of the one by certain rigid ſtrokes of the pencil too formidable to be ſeen with pleaſure; and they pourtray the marking fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the other, either ſo looſely or ludicrouſly, that, as we have no violent deſire to poſſeſs the one, ſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0673203200:40"/>
have we no remarkable diſguſt to the other. Nay, our refined moral mongers advance much farther; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion herſelf, a word for ever at the tip of their tongues, and the very God of it, a term even more in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſage, ſuffers at the very time they pretend the contrary. Like the "hand-writing upon the wall," it is upon record againſt the conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of ſome of our dabblers in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, that they have deſcribed the Deity infinitely more like a devil than a God: they tell us, he is all merciful and all benevolent, and yet very gravely inſiſt, his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are extreme, and his anger, on particular occaſions, eternal; they deſcribe him as armed with a flaming
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0673203200:41"/>
ſword, to deſtroy the unhappy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of thoſe paſſions, which, they allow, he hath himſelf implanted; they talk of his having, propenſely, hardened the heart of the ſinner, as he did that of Pharoah, and yet that he rewards with plague and peſtilence the creature whom he hath <hi>deſtined</hi> to diſobedience; they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large much upon his tenderneſs, and yet obſerve, in one and the ſame page, that the crimes of the father ſhall be viſited on the children, even unto the fourth generation. I appeal to the man, who hath fortitude enough to think one moment for himſelf, whether the Omnipotent, thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated, is not rather diſhonoured than glorified! Are ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0673203200:42"/>
qualities poſſible, to an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence all pure, immutable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradictory? The real character of the univerſal Parent is clouded, confuſed, and enveloped, in the thick fog of human opinions and human inventions. Rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are, doubtleſs, held out to men as proper examples to encourage and to deter; but they ſhould never be injudiciouſly blended, as confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one with the other.</p>
               <p>How much happier would be the conſequence; how much more would it do honour to the Chriſtian cauſe, if divines and moraliſts were to inculcate, both in their public orations, and writings, that ſpecies
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0673203200:43"/>
of Morality, Sentiment, Philoſophy or whatever elſe you pleaſe to call it, which draws the portraits of Virtue with all poſſible amiableneſs, which is finely coloured, which has recourſe both to Eloquence and Poetry, in order to attract, and entertain, rather than to affright and diſguſt! Doubtleſs, more may be done by inviting than by inſiſting, eſpecially in caſes of duty and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which are, in themſelves, I conceive, not very conſiſtent with the pride or the dignity of human nature: true it is, that, a ſevere maſter may, by the power of that very ſeverity, create in a ſervant a kind of momentary veneration, but the very inſtant he is out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0673203200:44"/>
of his ſuperior, he admits, of neceſſity, a mixed ſentiment of hatred and terror. This mode of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may ſoar from familiar life, to the laſt ſplendid degrees of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural grandeur, and power, which divines impute to the Deity. I aſk the reader, if, after having heard any diſcourſe in which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath been deſcribed in all its terrors, as holding out on the one hand, the horrors of perdition, and diſplaying, on the other, the ſigns of unrelenting and implacable reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt beings, confeſſedly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; I aſk, if he does not come away from ſuch diſcourſe, impreſſed, rather with a ſenſe of Almighty <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> and <hi>barbarity,</hi> than with the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0673203200:45"/>
comfortableideas, and all their chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſociations, of fairer and more alluring; attributes <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Hume hath, himſelf, noticed this contradiction: "Thus it may ſafely be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that popular religions are really, in the conception of their more vulgar votaries, a ſpecies of daemoniſm; and the higher the Deity is exalted in power and knowledge, the lower, of courſe, is he depreſſed in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benevolence; whatever epithets of praiſe may be beſtowed on him by his amazed adorers. Among idolaters, the words may be falſe, and belie the ſecret opinion: but among more exalted religion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, the opinion itſelf often contracts a kind of falſehood, and belies the inward ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The heart ſecretly deteſts ſuch meaſures of cruel and implacable ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; but the judgment dares not but pronounce them perfect and adorable. And the additional miſery of this inward ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle aggravates all the other terrors, by which theſe unhappy victims to ſuperſtition are for ever haunted.
<p>Lucian obſerves, that a young man, who reads the hiſtory of the gods in Homer or Heſiod, and finds their factions, wars, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, inceſt, adultery, and other immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities ſo highly celebrated, is much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized afterwards, when he comes into the world, to obſerve, that puniſhments are by law inflicted on the ſame actions, which he had been taught to aſcribe to ſuperior be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The contradiction is ſtill perhaps ſtronger between the repreſentations given us by ſome latter religions and our natural ideas of generoſity, lenity, impartiality, and juſtice; and in proportion to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied terrors of theſe religions, the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous conceptions of the divinity are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied upon us. Nothing can preſerve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted the genuine principles of morals in our judgment of human conduct, but the abſolute neceſſity of theſe principles to the exiſtence of ſociety. If common conception can indulge princes in a ſyſtem of ethics, ſomewhat different from that which ſhould regulate private perſons, how much more thoſe ſuperior beings, whoſe attributes, views, and nature are ſo totally unknown to us? <hi>Sunt ſuperis ſua jura.</hi> The gods have maxims of juſtice peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves."</p>
                     <p>And again, in another place, with ſtill greater conciſeneſs: "How is the Deity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured in our repreſentations of him! What caprice, abſurdity, and immorality are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to him! How much is he degraded even below the character, which we ſhould naturally, in common life, aſcribe to a man of ſenſe and virtue!" <hi>Nat. Hiſt. Relig.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note>. This makes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0673203200:46"/>
it obvious, that the great arguments for belief of Chriſtianity, and love of its origin, are commonly miſtaken
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0673203200:47"/>
even by thoſe, who profeſſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preach every Sunday upon the ſubject. The <hi>frowns</hi> of God may terrify into an <hi>extorted</hi> obedience,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0673203200:48"/>
as we may frighten a child, or a domeſtic, into the very falſhood, for which we are at that moment chiding him. But this is, in effect, making God the cauſe of our hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy. Timorous minds, indeed, and thoſe who do not underſtand the phenomena of nature, may dread the found of the thunder, imputing that found, not to any thing in the order of nature, which is agreeable to the very conſtruction of the univerſe and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0673203200:49"/>
the regular operations of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ſyſtem, but to the immediate diſpleaſure of the Deity. Thus it is, that after any great calamity (whether public or private), ſuch as the effuſion of much blood by the ſucceſs of our national enemies, or the ſudden reduction of any family (an unexpected tranſition from affluence to impriſonment for inſtance), it is common enough for ignorant people to inflict upon themſelves very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and unneceſſary rigours, by way, it it preſumed, of propitiating the wrath of Providence, than which, by the bye, there cannot poſſibly be ſhewn to that Providence a greater indignity; for doth not this conduct evidently imply, that, God requires
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0673203200:50"/>
to be firſt thanked for having made men miſerable, and then bribed by flattery leſt that miſery ſhould be continued?</p>
               <p>I may receive a ſtroke of ill-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with a proper degree of firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with all the decencies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation; I may bear my burthen, either as a Philoſopher, or as a Chriſtian, but I can never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to believe, that any being can be <hi>barbarouſly</hi> delighted with the horrible incenſe of ſighs and tears; or that he exacts ſuch a diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical ſacrifice, and expects, at the ſame time, that we ſhould call it <hi>devotion.</hi> It is downright wickedneſs! The whole of the matter then, amounts
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0673203200:51"/>
to this,—To make men in love with <hi>any ſuperior power,</hi> he who repreſents to us the extent and the nature of that power, muſt take great care, leſt he deſtroys the hypotheſis, he means to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
               <p>To effect this, it is not neceſſary to make that power a mere <hi>fool of good-nature,</hi> any more than it is to make him a <hi>tyrant of cruelty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Would we wiſh to inſpire a ſtranger with a favourable idea of any of our acquaintance? we <hi>do</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his character by ſaying that, if he is once offended <hi>thoroughly,</hi> he will not only purſue the offenders
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0673203200:52"/>
to the verge of the grave, but even carry his reſentment into the coffin, and maliciouſly ſcatter the bones in teſtimony of the ſtill-ſurviving vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his reſentment; neither do we ſay, that he will wreak his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on the widow, or her now orphan children, becauſe, this would effectually deter from forming any ſort of connection with ſo execrable a wretch. No; we take the fairer ſide of the argument; we dwell upon ſuch parts of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as naturally recommend him to reaſon and the ſenſibilities; nay, rather than let him want a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit to the dignity or amiableneſs of his <hi>moral ſtature,</hi> we venture to draw a compliment or two from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0673203200:53"/>
of <hi>imagination,</hi> nor do we quit the charming ſubject till we have prepared the mind to expect the moſt delightful pleaſures in his ſociety.</p>
               <p>Such is exactly the caſe with the more magnificent image of the Deity, whom, we ſhall always hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in proportion as his attributes are repreſented, through the medium of gentleneſs, forgiveneſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency.</p>
               <p>There ſeems, however, no little ſhare of ignorance, in painting, thus publicly, the Deity in a paſſion; in giving him <hi>obſtinacy, ill-will, ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and all the turbulances of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0673203200:54"/>
a rigorous taſk-maſter; eſpecially where the ſervants themſelves are, by the neceſſity of their natures, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentenced to obey thoſe neceſſities.</p>
               <p>The trite and very vulgar argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>free-will</hi> with all the futile doctrine of <hi>agencies,</hi> which have, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily, employed ſo many thouſands reams of paper, fall to the very earth, and mix with the duſt of it, upon the honeſt ſcrutiny of thoſe, that are not to be deluded by the jargon of mere <hi>pulpit</hi> debate.</p>
               <p>But I ſhould, by entering upon this at preſent, take a much greater latitude than is now expedient; my deſign, being, not ſo much to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0673203200:55"/>
from my ſubject, as to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate what ſeems in its nature ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagous, to wit, ſome philoſophical ſtrictures on the danger of <hi>popular hypocriſy</hi> in ſacred matters, and on a mode of diſſimulation in <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,</hi> which diſhonours the frank and liberal ſpirit of true ſcience.

I have been entertained with the ingenuities of men, (I call them ingenuities, becauſe, ſometimes, they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0673203200:56"/>
really are ſuch,) who have volumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly recommended a <hi>ſomething,</hi> the practice of which was, to produce tranquillity and complacence; which was equally to defy diſtemper, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and revolution. This <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> they recommend, without bringing one ſolid argument in its favour<note n="*" place="bottom">The fuller proof of this matter, together with a free and fair enquiry into popular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and their regulating principles, is preparing for the preſs by the Author of this Apology, and will, it is hoped, clear from rubbiſh, our much-obſtructed idea on ſacred ſubjects.</note>. In <hi>their</hi> way, they reaſon "about it and about it," till the original idea, if, indeed, they ever had ſuch, is utterly annihilated. If, therefore, their miſconceptions and

blunders are thus manifeſt in <hi>devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> ſubjects, it may be expected that, they are not much more accurate or perſpicuous in the manufacture of writings adapted ſimply to what is called the decencies and decorums of ſocial life. I ſhall, however, as an inſtance, confine myſelf to expoſe the futility of what they call, with moſt atrocious affectation, <hi>delicacy</hi> of <hi>ſentiment;</hi> two words to which, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of their popular hypocritical meaning, imply more actual groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and downright ſenſuality, than all that ever was written by Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, or any other licentious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Rocheſter, indeed, <q>Shewed too much to raiſe deſire.</q> He made us delicate even from his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0673203200:58"/>
indelicacy; we behold his dirty, ill-diſpoſed, figures, in all their naſtineſs and nudity; the mind takes part with the body and recoils from enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But it is otherwiſe with wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that are eternally ſhewing you the ſentimental infamy of a perſonal treſpaſs, to which nature (they own), with all her attractive force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, inclines; while they condemn us to flame and faggot, if we yield to her dictates. It is the fault of theſe men that they too often <hi>remind</hi> us of agreeable error, they minutely diſcover the temptation, and point to the moſt irreſiſtible parts of it, yet charge us neither to touch nor to enjoy it. This is ſhameful; but it is, notwithſtanding, the baſis of many literary reputations.</p>

               <head>SECTION III. ON THE NATURAL DIGNITY OF THE LITERARY CHARACTER, AND THE REASONS WHICH HAVE BROUGHT IT INTO CONTEMPT.</head>
               <p>LET us now advert to <hi>another</hi> ſpecies of Hypocriſy, from which our Philoſopher was totally exempt; to which, indeed, his temper was perfectly ſuperior. Among the inſtances of generous independency in David Hume, muſt not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that manlineſs, which prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from wading through the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0673203200:60"/>
the proſtituted puddle of fawning DEDICATION. To this magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—to this firmneſs it was owing, that, his feelings were never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, nor his ſpirit at any time weighed down by the burden of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, ignominiouſly begged, and ungraciouſly beſtowed. Alexander, when he had won his world, had leſs reaſon to ſing forth the Io Pean of triumph, than had our author to gratulate himſelf on the ſatisfaction of "never having preferred a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to one great man, or ever of having made advances to any of them." To confeſs the truth, he wrote, generally, upon ſubjects of which the modern nobility are, for the moſt part, ſo contemptibly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0673203200:61"/>
that to have inſcribed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances ſo ſcientific to ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, would involve the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher in a ſimilar error of judgment. Indeed, nothing is more offenſive to men of true taſte, and right feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than the <hi>condeſcenſion</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of genius, to perſons of rank, merely as ſuch. This it is, more than any thing elſe, that hath help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to degrade the literary character; which, as it implies a ſuperior vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of intellect, and a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged capacity, poſſeſſes, naturally, an unrivalled dignity. According to all the ſyſtems of all the ſects, it is allowed that the <hi>human underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is the greateſt, as it is the moſt boaſted, diſtinction of <hi>human beings;</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0673203200:62"/>
conſequently, one of theſe beings muſt riſe higher than another in the ſcale of rationality, only by ſo much, as the diſtinguiſhing part of him is elevated above that of others: So, likewiſe, a ſhallow, illiterate, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant creature, muſt ſink in the ſcale, by the ſame equitable proportion. Now, it is eaſy to prove, that, what are called the Great (who are but too commonly the leaſt of all God's lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle atoms), muſt, according to the very nature of things, be amongſt the <hi>worſt</hi> judges of literary merit, and therefore, ſpeaking truly, its moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper patrons. Men, born to titles and to fortunes which deſcend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effort, or exertion of any talent (whatever, imagine the cultivation of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0673203200:63"/>
the mind totally adventitious: nor does the man of faſhion admit it into the catalogue of his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments. Even the harlequin Lord Cheſterfield—that ſucceſsful ſmatterer—allows only ſuch a ſhare of philoſophy, as belongs to the philoſophy of the paſſions; which is nothing more in his idea, than guarding <hi>yourſelf</hi> while you make a fine, dextrous, and ſucceſsful puſh at the paſſions of <hi>another.</hi> Giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, glitter, the indolence of plenty, and above all, its impudence, all contribute to render perſons of rank, ſrivolous, voluble, ſuperficial; the illuſtrious exceptions of a Bacon, a Bolingbroke, a Shafteſbury, a Lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telton, a Pruſſia, a Clarendon, have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0673203200:64"/>
nothing to do with a rule ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorably general.</p>
               <p>This being die caſe, can any thing be ſo prepoſterous, as to inſcribe to the mere tinſel of titles, the labours of learning, or the reflections of accurate and abſtruſe Philoſophy? Yet hath this been, for many ages, the practice. Whence hath it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened? The queſtion cannot be anſwered without affecting us.</p>
               <p>Fortune ſeems to have neglected thoſe, whom Nature hath moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; and <hi>men of genius,</hi> I ſuppoſe, think it but fair, to ſupply the defect by ſolliciting <hi>men of money.</hi> This ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation, however, ſubjects them to all that rudeneſs and diſdain, which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0673203200:65"/>
thoſe who have only a handful of authority, beſtow upon their flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The flatterers are, in turn, well ſerved; they ſet out upon a wrong principle—The intercourſe is altogether ill managed. Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being another ſource of our <hi>national Hypocriſy,</hi> deſerve a more correct inveſtigation. It has been juſt obſerved, that they are funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally falſe.</p>
               <p>A dedication admits of two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct definitions, of which, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, to the Patron, and one to the Author. The Patron not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives every untruth that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the pride of Panegyric, as his due, but believes, at the ſame
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0673203200:66"/>
time, that he receives it from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided being, who is to exiſt for a certain ſpace of time upon the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his encomium; Something therefore is uſually ſent to keep—(for I would adopt the great man's language)—"the poor devil of an Author from ſtarving:" The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's definition, is, on the other hand, ſo ſervile, as to deduct from every ſentiment of pity, and make us confeſs the juſtice of his diſgrace.—He is contented to laviſh praiſes, of which the beſt man on earth, might bluſh to be the objects, and he expects a golden reward, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to the violent colourings of the varniſh, and to the fainter, or

                     <p>But in juſtice to <hi>ſome</hi> Engliſh writers, I muſt not let this point go off thus ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, without producing, for the ſake of contraſt, a deſerving imitation, ſomething on the oppoſite ſide where even a Dedication appears amiable.

                     <q>MADAM, Among the many novelties with which your Ladyſhip, a ſtranger in our nation, is daily entertained, you have not yet been made acquainted with the poetical Engliſh liberty, the <hi>right of Dedication;</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles us to a <hi>priviledge,</hi> of celebrating what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for its native excellence, is the <hi>juſt</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of praiſe; and is an ancient <hi>charter,</hi> by which the Muſes have always a free acceſs to the habitation of the Graces</q>

Of much more ſervice, indeed, would it be to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, ſcience, and general learning, if their votaries were more inclined to cheriſh a ſpirit of intellectual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency—if, inſtead of cringing to a courtier, or running, from the moſt fordid motives, into panegeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal hyperbole, they were to aſſert

their dignity; and ſhew the ſuperior <note n="*" place="bottom">Of this intellectual ſuperiority, we have the corroborating evidence of the IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COMPARABLE VOLTAIRE, in the following ſentiments, taken from his "Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the Engliſh Nation."
<q>The circumſtance which moſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages the arts in England, is the great veneration which is paid them. The pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Prime Miniſter hangs over the chimney of his own cloſet, but I have ſeen that of Mr. Pope in twenty noblemen's houſes. Sir Iſaac Newton was revered in his life-time, and had a due reſpect paid to him after his death; the greateſt men in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſputing who ſhould have the honour of holding up his pall. Go into Weſtminſter Abbey, and you will find, that what raiſes the admiration of the ſpectator is not the Mauſoleums of the Engliſh kings, but the monuments, which the gratitude of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has erected to perpetuate the memory of thoſe illuiſtrious men who contributed to its glory. We view their ſtatues in that Abbey in the ſame manner, as thoſe of Sophocles, Plato, and other immortal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, were viewed in Athens; and I am perſuaded, that the bare ſight of thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious monuments has fired more than one breaſt, and been the occaſion of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming great men. <bibl>

               <p>Inſtead of this ſpirited conduct, however, we have the misfortune to perceive a ſtyle of baſeneſs and adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, creep through moſt of the epiſtles dedicatory for the ſpace of ſeveral centuries; by which means flattery and fulſomeneſs is aſſociated with the very idea of thoſe addreſſes, and the literary character is held, by the dulleſt of the ſpecies, in ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contempt.</p>

Require <hi>leave</hi> to do this!—Was there ever heard ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency?—The point is miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Be it again remarked, that, in true ſcience, there is a greatneſs which can ſeldom <hi>receive,</hi> though it may often, <hi>confer</hi> obligations. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius may more properly be ſaid to patronize, than be patronized.</p>
               <p>If a production is fit for the eye of men of taſte, it ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to men of rank; who are
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0673203200:85"/>
ready enough to be thought in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a fine taſte themſelves, and very frequently, no doubt, pay liberally, for their dedications, ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon that principle.</p>
               <p>If, on the other hand, a perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is crude, trifling, ill-writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and, notwithſtanding ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, is, without the conſent of the Patron, adorned with a name which it diſgraces, ſuch patron ought pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly to renounce his protection, and treat the pretender, as every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender of whatever profeſſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be treated; ſtill, however, with this ſalvo, that if the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could have done any ſervice to literature, or promoted, but in a

I have been ſomewhat copious on this ſubject, becauſe it has never, to my recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, been placed in a proper light.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, this doctrine of dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, may be little reliſhed by thoſe who are daily pampered into conceit by daily panegyric, but it is a juſtice which every man of letters

               <p>On ſuch qualities was founded the reputation of David Hume, ſo that upon <hi>this</hi> occaſion, at leaſt, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample may be held up to perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in literary purſuits, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtandard.</p>

               <head>SECTION IV. OF HUME'S PRINCIPLES, AND HIS MOTIVE FOR MAKING THEM PUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIC, WITH SOME REMARKS ON HIS CONDUCT IN HIS LAST MOMENTS.</head>
               <p>BUT to go on with the moral character of David Hume. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever places the writings of this Philoſopher beſide thoſe of many Chriſtian authors who have been much celebrated for them, will be able to judge without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. It is impoſſible for the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the elegant Tillotſon, or the orthodox Addiſon, to be more the champions of every part of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0673203200:89"/>
conduct, which tends to the welfare of the ſocial world, than thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents which are to be collected from Hume—Nay, the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſpirit of morality, the moſt likely of all others in the world, to affect this, breathes ardently through all his philoſophy: elegance of taſte, chaſtity of ſentiment, delicacy of paſſion, decency of manners, love of truth, command of paſſion, cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of friendſhip, and the good order, and political proſperity of the ſtate, are every where recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, Very few of our eminent writers on the oppoſite ſide of the queſtion can ſay as much. But, with reſpect to Mr. Hume, every
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0673203200:90"/>
effort of his pen ſtands in teſtimony of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations cannot, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, be called ſceptical. I do not, nor ſhall I preſume to ſay, how far Hume's philoſophy was right or erroneous in its <hi>principle.</hi> Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for my purpoſe, if I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any reader (that might heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate before) of his <hi>conſiſtency with himſelf:</hi> a point, which, is of the utmoſt conſequence to the cauſe of <hi>every</hi> ſyſtem, be its purport, and its objects what they may.</p>
               <p>The ſcience purſued with ſuch vigorous curioſity by Hume was, to uſe his own expreſſions, "to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0673203200:91"/>
know the different operations of the mind, to ſeparate them from each other, to claſs them under their proper heads, and to correct all that ſeeming diſorder, in which they lie involved, when made the object of reflection and enquiry!"</p>
               <p>It hath, generally, been thought that, our author carried this mental geography, as he calls it, too far into the realms of ſcepticiſm, and into the abſtruſe, bewildering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of unchearful metaphyſics. Yet, however ardent he was in ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this abſtract and difficult nature, no one will deny, that he drew the form of virtue, upon all occaſions, as the moſt lovely and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0673203200:92"/>
eſtimable of all objects. He firmly believed, that, in ſome very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant reſpects, truth was overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in error and ſuperſtition; he was, therefore, ſufficiently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing to try, if, by the aids of application, care, art, and diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating accuracy, he could not "unite the boundaries of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies of philoſophy, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling profound enquiry with clearneſs, and truth with novelty."</p>
               <p>This, it is confeſſed, was the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of a long, healthy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative life: he perſiſted in the purſuit, in defiance of all oppoſing fatigues, clamours, oppoſitions, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, oppreſſions. It could not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0673203200:93"/>
be the love of an eſtabliſhed literary ſame, that urged him to the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſuch reſearches, becauſe he knew there was, in <hi>his</hi> ſpecies of philoſophy, an abſtractedneſs, as well as a ſuppoſed ſpirit of fallacy, which, could not, in the nature of things, and certain prevailing modes, become for many ages, either a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, or a pleaſing ſcience. It was, to all intents and purpoſes, "<hi>caviare</hi> to the multitude." Nay, he was well perſuaded of all this, not only by the odium which was caſt upon his Treatiſe on Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which "fell dead born from the preſs," but alſo from the following paſſage, which ſhews how little hope he had of making the abſtruſe phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0673203200:94"/>
ſo generally reliſhed as that which is more gay, elegant, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial. "Nothing can be more uſeful," ſays he, "than compoſitions of the eaſy ſtyle and manner, which draw not too much from, life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no deep application, to be comprehended: and ſend back the ſtudent among mankind, full of noble ſentiments and wiſe precepts, applicable to every exigence of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life. By means of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, virtue becomes amiable, ſcience agreeable, company inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and refinement entertaining."</p>
               <p>A Philoſopher of Hume's cloſe, and difficult reaſoning, who was hardy enough, to ſcrutinize ſubjects,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0673203200:95"/>
imagined to puzzle more, as they are more inveſtigated—a man, who had either patience or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude enough to cultivate meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical ſcience, with a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined view of overturning, and eradicating, root and branch, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices which appeared <hi>to him</hi> at leaſt, to merit an analyſis which ſhould prove their futility.—Such a man, could not expect the ſame eclat with the generality of mankind, as thoſe who only played prettily on the ſurface of "a more eaſy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious philoſophy." Hume content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf with leſs general gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. His own remarks very fully convince us what he felt, what he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0673203200:96"/>
expected, and what he enjoyed on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>Speaking of the common diſtaſte to which men have for ſpeculations that require <hi>thinking,</hi> to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, he hath theſe ſentiments in the firſt ſection of his Enquiry concerning Human Underſtanding.</p>

                     </gap>ay carry its reſearches ſtill farther, and diſcover, at leaſt in ſome degree, the ſecret ſprings and principles, by which the human mind is actuated in its operations? Aſtronomers had long contented
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0673203200:97"/>
themſelves with proving, from the phaenomena, the true motions, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and magnitude of the heavenly bodies: till a philoſopher, at laſt, aroſe, who ſeems, from the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt reaſoning, to have alſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the laws and forces, by which the revolutions of the planets are governed and directed. The like has been performed with regard to other parts of nature. And there is no reaſon to deſpair of equal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in our enquiries concerning the mental powers and oeconomy, if proſecuted wlth equal capacity and caution. It is probable, that one operation and principle of the mind depends on another; which, again, may be reſolved into one more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0673203200:98"/>
and univerſal: and how far theſe reſearches may poſſibly be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, it will be difficult for us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or even after, a careful trial, exactly to determine. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that attempts of this kind are every day made even by thoſe who philoſophize the moſt negligently: and nothing can be more requiſite than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough care and attention; that, if it lie within the compaſs of human underſtanding, it may at laſt be happily atchieved; if not, it may, however, be rejected with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and ſecurity. This laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, ſurely, is not deſirable; nor ought it to be embraced too raſhly. For how much muſt we
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0673203200:99"/>
diminiſh from the beauty and value of this ſpecies of philoſophy, upon ſuch a ſuppoſition? Moraliſts have hitherto been accuſtomed, when they conſidered the vaſt multitude and diverſity of actions that excite our approbation or diſlike, to ſearch for ſome common principle, on which this variety of ſentiments might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. And though they have ſome times carried the matter too far, by their paſſion for ſome one general principle, it muſt, however, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that they are excuſable in expecting to find ſome general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, into which all the vices and virtues were juſtly to be reſolved. The like has been the endeavour of critics, logicians, and even politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0673203200:100"/>
nor have their attempts been wholly unſucceſsful; though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps longer time, greater accuracy, and more ardent application, may bring theſe ſciences ſtill nearer their perfection. To throw up at once all pretenſions of this kind may juſtly be deemed more raſh, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate, and dogmatical, than even the boldeſt and moſt affirmative philoſophy, which has ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to impoſe its crude dictates and principles on mankind.</p>
                  <p>What though theſe reaſonings concerning human nature ſeem ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, and of difficult comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? This affords no preſumption of their falſehood. On the contrary,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0673203200:101"/>
it ſeems impoſſible, that what has hitherto eſcaped ſo many wiſe and profound philoſophers can be very obvious and eaſy. And whatever pains theſe reſearches may coſt us, we may think ourſelves ſufficiently rewarded, not only in point of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit but of pleaſure, if, by that means, we can make any addition to our ſtock of knowledge, in ſubjects of ſuch unſpeakable importance.</p>
               </q>
               <p>But as we read Mr. Hume's life, written by his own hand, we ſhall have freſh opportunities to clear up any doubts that may remain of his ſincerity. It ſeems pretty evident, that the little ſketch, called MY OWN LIFE, was thought neceſſary, by Mr. Hume, to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0673203200:102"/>
be before hand with his philoſophic antagoniſts, whom, he foreſaw, would raiſe new outcries againſt him, upon the ideas they might indulge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe cloſing ſenſations which would attack him, within fight of the grave. To prevent little tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of this nature, I ſay, it is highly probable he choſe the fairer method of being his <hi>own</hi> hiſtorian; and never was there a biographical tract drawn up by any man in the higheſt health, with more coolneſs, more conciſeneſs, more impartiality.</p>
               <p>He ſat down to this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary employment, and took up the pen, exactly at the time that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds—I might, I believe, extend

                  </gap> thinking he would begin the bitter groans of recantation. I certainly ſhall not take upon me to ſay how far this employment was proper, but the annals of the world cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly produce any inſtance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by philoſophy became ſo much <hi>of a piece.</hi> Whatever were the ſingularities of that philoſophy, I once more inſiſt upon it, it was a ſtrong evidence that he diſdained any of the popular hypocriſy now in vogue. He could not counterfeit the alterations which he did not feel riſen in his mind; he was calm enough to give a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did account of his literary life, when he <hi>knew</hi> himſelf to be <hi>incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>

After he had written it, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the ſame tranquil compoſure, in regard to the nearer approaches of death: Nay, ſuch was his ſteadineſs to the principles by which he was directed, that, in a codicil to his will, he deſired the narrative of his life might be prefixed to the next edition of his works.</p>
               <p>Having finiſhed the account of his life, he had no farther oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to employ the pen, except from time to time, to ſend notes of information to the tender enquiries of his friends; among the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and diſtinguiſhed of theſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been Mr. Adam Smith, to whom, two or three days before

He never dropped the ſmalleſt expreſſion of impatience; but when he had occaſion to ſpeak to the people about him, always did it with affection and tenderneſs. I thought it improper to write to bring you over, eſpecially as I heard that he had dictated a letter to you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring you not to come. When he became very weak, it coſt him an effort to ſpeak, and he died in ſuch a happy compoſure of mind, that nothing could exceed it.</p>

               <p>WE have now ſurveyed our object in the moſt trying moments—We have ſeen him ſuperior to all ordinary terrors, and equal to all occaſions. It is taken for granted, therefore, that as a philoſopher, both in precept and practice, it will be allowed he was compleat, exact,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0673203200:113"/>
unchangeable—that, whether wrong or right, he acted, immediately, from his own boſom conviction; a conviction grounded upon intenſe and abſtract attention, and not taken up ſuddenly without reſpect either to cauſe or to conſequence. Thus far, then, the point is cleared before me; but I cannot perſuade myſelf to reſign Mr. Hume till I have done ampler juſtice to his memory, and to that ſocial, and <hi>honeſt</hi> conduct which ſo much endears it.</p>
               <p>I would draw a ſlight parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this gentlemen, and another celebrated writer, who deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the tomb a little before him. I would perſuade the reader to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

with me the ſyſtem of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Hume, and that of the late Earl of Cheſterfield. Not with a view of propoſing the former to his imitation—for that point ſhould always be ſettled by a man's own mind, after a great deal of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation upon the matter—but, as it may ſerve to ſhew, what hath, indeed, been a principal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in theſe pages, that it is poſſible even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<p>He was, therefore, not only a <hi>conſiſtent,</hi> but an <hi>honeſt</hi> writer.

I muſt once more advert to a horrid contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the zealots—the little correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and, indeed, generally ſpeaking, the conſtant quarrelling there is betwixt their precept, and practice! Well might Hume obſerve, that, if we examime the lives of theſe men, we ſhould ſcarcely think that they repoſed the ſmalleſt confidence in their pious proteſations. What! cannot the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful belief of an ever-protecting real Preſence,—cannot the charming hopes of Omnipotent favour, nor the merits of a Saviour, nor the expectations of a bleſſed Immortality, infuſe inter theſe ſluggiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioniſts, an emulative ſpirit to exceed the goodneſs, and common conduct of men, like David Hume, who believed all theſe fair proſpects, to be "a riddle, an aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, an inexplicable myſtery."</p>

What pretenſions can men have to credit who belie <hi>themſelves?</hi> I ſtill diſpute not the propriety of the Chriſtian Religion, but I muſt be candid enough to confeſs, I lay no great ſtreſs upon the manner of ſome of its <hi>followers,</hi>—and yet they have modeſty enough to be very angry if any one queſtions their ſincereſt pretenſions.</p>

illuſtrious perſons who have never ventured ſo far into the receſſes of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0673203200:116"/>
enquiry. Lord Cheſterfield was a character more diſtinguiſhed for the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0673203200:117"/>
brilliancy of his wit, than the ſolider powers of his underſtanding.—In
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0673203200:118"/>
points of philoſophy, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſuperficial, in politics he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0673203200:119"/>
did not want ſagacity or experience. Aſſiſted, however, very much, by the ſplendours of his title—for a little ſpark will make a large luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre in a Lord—he ſuſtained his character with ſingular eclat, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0673203200:120"/>
paſſed in the world (which is very eaſily dazzled) as a compound of elegance, humour, <hi>morality,</hi> gaiety, and patronage.—Theſe qualities, in a certain degree, we allow him to have poſſeſſed, except one: it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is not now neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that it is the word <hi>morality</hi> which muſt be ſcratched out of this liſt. For many years, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Lord Cheſterfield's <hi>morals</hi> were unſuſpected; at length, too ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial to be conſiſtent, or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, weary of deceiving the world into notions of his plain-dealing, he condeſcended, in the eve of life, to ſhew mankind what a bubble he had made of it; how long, and how ſucceſsfully he had ſported up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0673203200:121"/>
on its weakneſſes—with how much caſe he had played the elegant trifler, and by what modes and manoeuvres, he had, with a facility which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no effort but a ſmooth face, and pliable features, led, in victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious chains, a thouſand fools to the altars either of ridicule, or debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, or deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Such were the principles; ſuch is the ſyſtem of this <hi>diſtinguiſhed hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,</hi> by the adoption of whoſe precepts, it is utterly impoſſible either for youth or age, wit or wiſdom, to eſcape every thing that is execrable, contemptible, and deluſive. The atheiſtical Hume, as ſome have called him, was, in compariſon with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0673203200:122"/>
Cheſterfield, deſerving of every epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet that could be formed in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to expreſs virtue. In his life, writing, and at his death, he ſeems to have abhorred <hi>diſſimulation;</hi> and yet, his company "was not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to the young and careleſs, as well as to the ſtudious, and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary;" nor had he "any reaſon to complain of the reception he met from <hi>modeſt</hi> women, in whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he was particularly delighted." He did not, nevertheleſs, profeſs a fondneſs for the ſociety of <hi>modeſt</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, becauſe it was <hi>ſafer</hi> to have an affair of gallantry with ſuch, than with a proſtitute profeſſed; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the connection was more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and conſiſtent with the amours
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0673203200:123"/>
of a gentleman; nor did he mix with the gay, and careleſs, with any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent deſign to take an advantage or the chearful hour, in order to make himſelf maſter of the ſecrets of the heart, imparted in its fullneſs—and conſequently maſter of the perſon to whom that entrapped heart had the misfortune to belong. By no means.—Whatever objections may lie againſt the philoſophy of Hume; none of them are of this nature; ſince his moſt abſtract reſearches were in favor of a behaviour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly irreproachable.</p>
               <p>Whoever is acquainted with Mr. Hume's writings, will bear witneſs, that he was a lover or decency, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0673203200:124"/>
and decorum. Whoever knew the man, can atteſt, that, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſages are no wife exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated.</p>
               <p>"I am" ſays he, "or rather <hi>was,</hi> (for that is the ſtyle I muſt now uſe in ſpeaking of myſelf, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens me the more to ſpeak my ſentiments); I was, I ſay, a man of mild diſpoſitions, of command of temper, of an open, ſocial, and cheerful humour, capable of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but little ſuſceptible of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and of great moderation in all my paſſions. Even my love of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary ſame, my ruling paſſion, never ſoured my temper, notwithſtanding my frequent diſappointments. My

company was not unacceptable to the young and careleſs, as well as to the ſtudious and literary; and as I took a particular pleaſure in the company of modeſt women, I had no reaſon to be diſpleaſed with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though moſt men any wiſe eminent, have found reaſon to complain of calumny, I never was touched, or even attacked by her baleful tooth: and though I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly expoſed myſelf to the rage of both civil and religions factions, they ſeemed to be diſarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury.

cunning, and congee, as Lord Cheſterfield; unleſs, indeed, he is brought forward by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt. There appears likewiſe to me, to have been as wide a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the ſize of their abilities, as there was in the honeſty of their principles: every page in thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which have laid open his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's hypocriſy, furniſhes us with examples of his futility: it would be the drudgery of a day to detect a ſingle light ſentence in Hume. The Earl of Cheſterfield's utmoſt ſtretch of penetration, amounts to little more than ſhrewdneſs, partly caught from the ſuggeſtions of a mind na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſuſpicious, and partly from obſervations upon the weakneſſes,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0673203200:128"/>
and tender imperfections of men leſs capable to diſſemble. This faculty, is at beſt, but a principal ingredient in the character of a <hi>cunning</hi> fellow, who, as it were, by imperceptible ſlight of hand, hath the art of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing what he is not; and of cheating you, with ſingular dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, even before your face.</p>
               <p>But all the ſame, of popular eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette that could poſſibly ariſe from ſuch practices, Hume would have diſcarded with diſdain. And, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for two reaſons: firſt, his genius had not a ſingle grain of the petit maitre in it, which, by the way, was a conſiderable ingredient in Lord Cheſterfield's; and, ſecondly, he had too much dignity in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0673203200:129"/>
and too juſt a ſenſe of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial compact between the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, and the whole human race, to find any zeſt in gratifications, which emanated from, neither more, nor leſs, than flagrant treachery. Hence it appears obvious enough, that the Earl of Cheſterfield's heart and head, were both unable to bear any ſort of parallel, with the head and heart of David Hume. The one is the Author of a ſyſtem which ſeems to have been pillaged from the Dancing-maſter, the Perfumer, and the Devil: the other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues a philoſophy, which, with all its exceptions, gives coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance neither to the follies of a coxcomb, nor the meanneſs, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0673203200:130"/>
miſchief of a hypocrite—a wretch, which, in the courſe of theſe pages hath been marked with ſingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; and above all other hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, one that, ina kind of moral maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade dreſs, perpetrates every baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and paſſes upon the world as a <hi>mighty good Chriſtian creature.</hi>

               <p>WITH regard to the ſceptical doubts which might ſtart into the philoſophical and reaſoning mind of Mr. Hume, it is, I once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, no part of my office, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend or to cenſure them. As a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of men have employed their talents on <hi>one</hi> ſide of an important ſubject, he hath taken the liberty, as a philoſopher, to offer his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0673203200:132"/>
on the <hi>other</hi> ſide: conſidered in the light of ſpeculation, this is certainly fair; for who can circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the efforts of a mind, bent for any length of time, on one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite point?</p>
               <p>The ſyſtems of either party, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ought not to ſway any man againſt the concurrence of his own reaſon; for, at that rate, one might be a Chriſtian, a Deiſt, a Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or an Atheiſt, in obedience to the bidding of another: by which means our religion would have more colours than the camelion, and more alterations than Proteus. A ſenſible man, will never have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility enough for this. If he is yet
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0673203200:133"/>
uneſtabliſhed in his more ſerious te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, he will ſee what can be ſaid both <hi>for</hi> and <hi>againſt:</hi> of oppoſite principles, it is his buſineſs to fix upon thoſe which appear the moſt congruous, and probable. <note n="*" place="bottom">Reaſon, indeed, I know not why, hath long been <hi>unreaſonably</hi> denied a proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of her power, in religious matters; while Faith is honoured with the priviledge of inſiſting upon implicit obedience: yet the former, is called the nobleſt faculty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and the latter, ſhould, certainly, only be allowed to follow in the train. The common argument, is little more than this,—You muſt believe, becauſe you muſt believe. It is in vain to pretend any regard to proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; or to urge, againſt things ſacred, the convictions of cloſe reaſoning—Reaſon is out of the queſtion.—Is it not written in <hi>the Book?</hi> The queſtion, to be ſure, muſt not be anſwered, but in one way. You <hi>muſt</hi> have Faith.—Now, it appears to me, that to call Reaſon our ſovereign diſtinction, and yet reject its influence in points of eternal moment, while we affect to obſerve its dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates in matters indifferent, is juſt as rational as if we were to hold ſacred and obligatory, thoſe edicts of parliament which regulate our more public ſpectacles,—ſuch as plays and puppet-ſhews; while we ſnap our fingers at the ſtate, and the perſonage who rules it, whenever a mandate is iſſued for the good order, and welfare of what is moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to the policy, power, or proſperity of nations. This method of <hi>forcing</hi> any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular faith upon a man, though it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aking an enemy by ſurpriſe, is, yet, ridiculous enough in its nature, to admit an illuſtration, in the following paſſages from Henry Fielding's Romance of Joſeph Andrews.
<p>"Mr. Barnabas was again ſent for, and with much difficulty prevailed on to make another viſit. As ſoon as he entered the room, he told Joſeph, 'he was come to pray by him, and to prepare him for another world: In the firſt place therefore, he hoped he had repented of all his ſins?' Joſeph anſwered, 'he hoped he had: but there was no one thing which he knew not whether he ſhould call a ſin; if it was, he feared he ſhould die in the commiſſion of it, and that was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret of parting with a young woman, whom he loved as tenderly as he did his heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings?' Barnabas bad him be aſſured, that 'any repining at the Divine Will, was one of the greateſt ſins he could commit; that he ought to forget all carnal affections, and think of better things.' Joſeph ſaid, 'that neither in this world, nor the next, he could forget his Fanny, and that the thought, however grievous, of parting from her for ever, was not half ſo tormenting, as the fear of what ſhe would ſuffer when ſhe knew his misfortune.' Barnabas ſaid, 'that ſuch fears argued a diffidence and deſpondence very criminal; that he muſt diveſt himſelf of all human paſſion, and fix his heart above.' Joſeph anſwered, 'that was what he deſired to do, and ſhould be obliged to him, if he would enable him to accompliſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>' Barnabas replied,'that muſt be done by Grace.' Joſeph beſought him to diſcover how he might attain it.' Barnabas anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, 'by Prayer and Faith.' He then queſtioned him concerning his forgiveneſs of the Thieves. Joſeph anſwered, 'he feared, that was more than he could do: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would give him more pleaſure than to hear they were taken.' 'That,' cries Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, 'is for the ſake of juſtice.' 'Yes,' ſaid Joſeph, 'but if I was to meet them again, I am afraid I ſhould attack them, and kill them too, if I could.' 'Doubtleſs,' anſwered Barnabas, 'it is lawful to kill a thief: but can you ſay, you forgive them as a Chriſtian ought?' Joſeph deſired to know what that forgiveneſs was. 'That is,' anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered Barnabas, 'to forgive them as—as—it is to forgive them as—in ſhort, it is to forgive them as a Chriſtian.' Joſeph replied, 'he forgave them as much as he could.' 'Well, well,' ſaid Barnabas, 'that will do.' 'He then demanded of him, if he remembered any more ſins unrepented of; and if he did, he deſired him to make haſte and repent of them as faſt as he could: that they might repeat over a few prayers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.' Joſeph anſwered, 'he could not recollect any great crimes he had been guilty of, and that thofe he had committed, he was ſincerely ſorry for.' Barnabas ſaid that was enough, and then proceeded to prayer with all the expedition he was maſter of: ſome company then waiting for him below in the parlour, where the ingredients for punch were all in readineſs; but no one would ſqeeze the oranges till he came."</p>
                     <p>I am afraid the arguments of Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas are, for the moſt part, full as cogent as thoſe which impoſe a ſyſtem upon us, without allowing us to conſult the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.—Are they <hi>afraid</hi> we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to ſo ſober an authority as Reaſon? Is it for their <hi>intereſt</hi> to make us the mere tools of credulity? Is it political to beat us, <hi>vi, et armis,</hi> into adoption of their favourite tenets? Such an aſſault upon vulgar, timid minds, may be very alarming; but, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I could never be inclined, either to Dieſm, Mahomatiſm, or Chriſtianity by <hi>compulſion.</hi> The Philoſopher, will, ſo far at leaſt, be a free agent, and, like poor Joſeph, believe <hi>as well,</hi> and <hi>as much as he can.</hi>

The evidence once ſatisfactory to the ſenſes of the judge, and all doubt removed by ſeveral facts, each agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the other, and all reſolving themſelves into an harmonious whole, he proceeds, without farther debate or delay, to the final ſentence, which, whether it diſpenſes life or death, is given with the ſame firmneſs, ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and reſolution.</p>

Similar to this, ſhould be the procedure of any perſon uneſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his religious concerns. It is too important an article to take up on mere truſt. A thinking man will not be a Deiſt, or a Chriſtian, only becauſe his father before him, and all the other branches of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were one of thoſe. He will look with an eye of penetration into the circumſtances: he will ſee why, wherefore, and upon what conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, this adopts Chriſtianity, that Deiſm. He will compare one ſyſtem to another; examine their diſtinct parts, and correſpondencies.—Trace out the points where they ſeparate, where they blend: in what they are utterly different, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0673203200:142"/>
in they are obviouſly, or apparently analogous.</p>
               <p>When this ſober taſk is diligently done, let reaſon aſſert her dignity, and having ſcrutinized liberally, let her liberally determine. To which ever ſide ſhe inclines, let it be upon the reſult of her conviction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying any regard to paſſion, or prejudice, two mercenary coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, which, in the court of moral arbitration, are too apt to take bribes, and turn the iſſue of the cauſe, while they endeavour to blind the equity and diſcernment of the magiſtrate.</p>

Aboe all other <hi>fatal things,</hi> I warn you not to give implicit cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to <hi>great authorities,</hi> which, in religious caſes, are never to have an undue influence. Let not the force, ſplendour, or power of a name, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, or awe you into a partial choice. Religion, like matrimony, ſhould be, if poſſible, ſettling for life. Let neither Hume, or Addiſon, or Bacon, or Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke, Locke, or Tillotſon, ſway you by any thing, but the actual weight of arguments, which ſtrike eventually and irreſiſtibly upon the <hi>rational</hi> faculty.</p>
               <p>Theſe hints purſued, will, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but believe, ſerve, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0673203200:144"/>
every heſitating perſon; and, when carried into practice, I have faith enough in them to conjecture, they will enable every one who is pleaſed to lend them his attention, to act honeſtly, amiably, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly; and to diſcharge his duty according to the truth that is in him, whether he be of one religion or another.</p>
               <p>Of David Hume, or of his phiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, I ſhall ſay no more; but from a ſuccinct view of the whole matter, I apprehend it may very fairly be concluded, in repetition of Mr. Smith's words, that, "though men will, no doubt, judge variouſly of his philoſophical opinions, every one
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0673203200:145"/>
approving, or condemning them, according as they happen to coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide or diſagree with his own, yet, concerning his character and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, there can ſcarce be a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of opinion."</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR very <hi>Chriſtian</hi> epiſtle, wet from the Clarendon preſs, was brought to me by my bookſeller, juſt as I was correcting a proof ſheet of that Apology, from the firſt advertiſement of which, in the news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, you ſeem to have caught the hint of your title: I mean ſo
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0673203200:148"/>
much of it as relates to the Life, Death, and Philoſophy of David Hume, Eſq.</p>
            <p>Upon ſhewing <hi>my</hi> original title<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page<note n="*" place="bottom">The original title-page, printed in the London Packet, run thus: An Apology for the Life, Death, and Philoſophy of David Hume, &amp;c.</note> to a learned acquaintance, he ſaid he diſcovered therein a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible impropriety. An Apology for the Death for any man, he thought, unneceſſary. Your letter convinces me, the blunder would not have amounted to an Iriciſm, had it been admitted agreeable to my firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;—ſince you have, I find, as many, and as powerful objections
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0673203200:149"/>
to Mr. Hume's manner of dying, as to his manner of living. But your letter to Dr. Smith is too ſingular not to command as much of my attention, as can, at this late period of my time, when The APOLOGY is juſt ſtepping abroad, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
            <p>Your epiſtle, Sir, is the firſt of thoſe—though I confeſs it came out rather ſooner than I expected—which I prognoſticated would be levelled both at David Hume and Dr. Smith. It is certainly right that the people called Chriſtians, ſhould, with all decent earneſtneſs, eſpouſe the cauſe of that religion, upon whoſe ſacred foundations their
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0673203200:150"/>
faith is eſtabliſhed. I blame you not, therefore—the more eſpecially if you are of the holy order, which I take to be the caſe—for drawing your weapon in behalf of what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to you, to be the only ſyſtem that ought to be univerſally adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is laudable: it is amiable: it is noble. But then it ſhould have been done—a buſineſs ſo important—ſo delicate—ſhould have been done, Sir, without ſpleen, without rancour, without uncharitableneſs.</p>
            <p>Hath this been the caſe?—The rage of a hurried compoſition is now gratified, your zeal hath almoſt kindled the wheels in its journey to London, and you are, perhaps,—or
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0673203200:151"/>
you will be, by the time this reaches you, in your—I will not call it—<hi>eaſy</hi> chair.—Pray—reverend Sir—you ſee I cannot help thinking I am addreſſing a clergyman, though without your precaution I ſhould have known you were not writing with the pen of a B—.</p>
            <p>Pray, reverend Sir, let your pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet lie upon the table, as you and I—with the pleaſantry which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is ſo dear to you—examine ſome of its paragraphs.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>ſtyle</hi> is, as you ſay, "<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter, p. 2.</note> free and eaſy" enough; but neither in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0673203200:152"/>
               <hi>that,</hi> nor in your ſentiment, do you appear to have "in your compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any large proportion of that which our inimitable Shakeſpeare ſtyles, <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter, p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>the milk of human kindneſs"</hi> And though it muſt be confeſſed, you now and then are, as you ſay, ready to praiſe, yet it is of that ſort, as if <q>Your ſpirit mock'd itſelf.</q> or to apply another poetical expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which ſeems not to be ill-ſuited—<q>You <hi>damn</hi> with <hi>faint praiſe.</hi>
               </q> The other part of this memorable couplet muſt, however, be paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0673203200:153"/>
to be appoſite; for, your <hi>leer</hi> is by no means <hi>civil,</hi> and you <hi>do</hi> ſneer yourſelf moſt horribly, even while you are teaching <hi>others</hi> to ſneer—</p>
            <p>Proceed we to the proof.</p>
            <p>It is with a very conſiderable ſhare of prudence, that you adviſe ſuch readers as <note n="*" place="bottom">See advertiſement to Letter, p. i.</note> find no ſatisfaction in your book, to "throw it into the fire."—I confeſs, I was, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the peruſal, more than once tempted to make a ſacrifice of this nature; and I more than once, alſo, heartily regretted the <note n="†" place="bottom">Ditto, p. ii.</note> loſs of my
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0673203200:154"/>
ſhilling, and I ſhall, certainly, take care "<note n="*" place="bottom">Advertiſement, p. ii.</note> not to loſe another in the ſame manner." Not, Sir, becauſe "<note n="†" place="bottom">See Letter, p. 3.</note> I am an enemy to human learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or that I could not have made a hearty meal, upon a good, fair, and candid defence of Chriſtianity, as yourſelf; but becauſe, I cannot poſſibly conſider, as candid or fair, or good, a pamphlet, which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with an indecent degree of warmth, and with very little regard to liberality. What have you not, upon the preſent occaſion, <hi>drolled upon?</hi>—You have choſen to write your letter to Dr. Smith in a <hi>droll</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0673203200:155"/>
way, upon the moſt ſerious of all human ſubjects, and yet you are very angry that our dying philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, ſhould, in his laſt hours, "<note n="*" place="bottom">See Letter, p. 10.</note> read Lucian—play at whiſt, and <hi>droll</hi> upon Charon and his boat."—I ſhould not—I <hi>ſhall</hi> not, Sir,—oppoſe Mr. Hume's philoſophy, to the principles of Chriſtianity—but I think it very hard that you ſhould ſo entirely forget, the Chriſtian temper, the Chriſtian meekneſs, and the Chriſtian charity, which ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently diſtinguiſhed its divine maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—Nay, you are deficient in the very liberality, which ſhould mark every fair, and rational enquirer.—Is it liberal, Sir, to turn the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0673203200:156"/>
of ridicule againſt a long life of—<hi>good-nature, compaſſion, genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, charity;</hi> merely becauſe his opinion happen to differ from yours?—Is that rectitude of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which confeſſedly marked Mr. Hume, to be dwindled down to nothing, for the ſake of ſupporting an argument on the oppoſite ſide of the queſtion? Is it I ſay, Sir, to be ſhunk into the idea of his being "<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter, p. 11.</note> 
               <hi>good company,</hi> and knew how to manage his <hi>cards?"</hi>—But almoſt every part of your letter to Dr. Smith allows ſufficient ſcope for the ſevereſt cenſure. The witticiſm of turning Mr. Hume's Hiſtory of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0673203200:157"/>
England into a noble effort of <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter, p. 3.</note> 
               <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and motion,</hi> is wretched: to pay you, however, a compliment, in <hi>kind,</hi> I muſt juſt expreſs my notion, that, your pamphlet neither poſſeſſes ſuch valuable <hi>matter;</hi> nor do I think it will have, by any means, ſo noble a <hi>motion:</hi> it will, I truſt, like one of Hume's treatiſes, <hi>fall dead born from the preſs,</hi> and the amongſt the things which are no more remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, although you have, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, called it an <note n="†" place="bottom">Ditto, p. 24.</note> 
               <hi>alarum</hi> bell to the admirers of Mr. Hume: yea, even though you inſiſt upon it—with a zeal which reliſhes more of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0673203200:158"/>
bigotry than Chriſtianity—<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter, p. 25.</note> that it ſhould be rung in their ears, till ſucceeded by the laſt trumpet.</p>
            <p>The queſtions you addreſs to Dr. Smith, are, moſt of them, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſuperficial; the firſt is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ridiculous. "Why all this hurry and buſtle, to ſatisfy the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, that our Philoſopher lived and died perfectly compoſed and eaſy? Was there, ſay you, any ſuſpicion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he might not, at times, be quite ſo compoſed and eaſy as he ſhould have been?"</p>
            <p>And would you really have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious anſwer to ſo ſilly a queſtion?
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0673203200:159"/>
Pray, Sir, was there ever yet a being ſo uniformly tranquil, ſo perpetually ſerene, as to be always the ſame, and appear to his family, to his friends, and to his foes, without ſome little diſcompoſure? If you ſpeak in a <hi>religious</hi> ſenſe: I deſire to know, whether the firmeſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian—to pay you the compliment—Sir—whether <hi>you,</hi> have not, at times, had upon you thoſe feelings which have run counter to the general tenor of a more collected conduct; and whether, now and then, you you have not been, even in points of orthodoxy, leſs compoſed, and leſs eaſy than you could wiſh to have been? The beſt men upon earth, are, in proportion to their ſenſibility,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0673203200:160"/>
the moſt ſuſceptible of theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional diſorders; nor can all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or Fortitude, or Philoſophy in the whole world prevent it.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond interrogatory, and the third, which is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the ſecond, are not more aptly propoſed, nor deſerve they a more ſober anſwer than the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter, p. 25.</note> "Was there ever any <hi>Book</hi> written againſt Mr. Hume—which ſhook his ſyſtem to pieces about his ears, and reduced it to a heap of ruins, the ſucceſs and eclat of which might be ſuppoſed to have hurt his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0673203200:161"/>
mind, and to have affected his health? "Was there any <hi>Author,</hi> whoſe <hi>name,</hi> his friends never dared to mention before him, and was not all ſtrangers, that were introduced to him, againſt doing it; becauſe he never failed, when by any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident it was done, to fly out into a tranſport of paſſion and ſwearing? or hath no book been written to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the growth and increaſe of his philoſophic reputation?"—In reply to theſe ſeveral points I ſhall wave all ſtricture upon the ſcurility, and unchriſtian ſpirit which is mixed up with them, and only obſerve, that, no book <hi>has</hi> been written, that has impaired Hume's philoſophical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; a philoſophic reputation,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0673203200:162"/>
ſubſiſts only among philoſophers; and they, to a man, hold Beattie's Book in contempt; which, is a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy calculated only for ladies, and fine gentlemen.</p>
            <p>Your arguments, Sir, are not much happier than your queſtions; as your remarks are in general, poorer than both. I ſhall expoſe the futi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of theſe, as their abſurdity oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs to my mind, upon a re-examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of your Letter.</p>
            <p>What you have called a <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter, p. 39.</note> "ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of Mr. Hume's doctrines, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical and moral," is either a <hi>wilful</hi> or an <hi>ignorant,</hi> miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0673203200:163"/>
of Hume's ſyſtem, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in any one part or paſſage, gave you firſt cauſe to ſay, its author, at any time<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter, p. 16.</note> "ſat down calmly and deliberately to obliterate from the hearts of the human ſpecies every trace of the knowledge of God and his diſpenſations." Much leſs did he endeavour to "extirpate all hope of enjoying God's grace and favour." On the contrary, I do again inſiſt, that Mr, Hume's philoſophical ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, inculcated every thing praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy <note n="†" place="bottom">See Apology, Sect. 3. p. 70. 71. 72.</note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sir, you are upon a wrong ground in aſſerting that, to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0673203200:164"/>
want honeſty, and to want under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and to want a leg, are equally the objects of <hi>moral</hi> diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probatian.</p>
            <p>This cannot be any part of David Hume's doctrine, neither can bear critical examination. In fact, the moſt pitiable of all human objects is a diſhoneſt reprobate, for nothing can ſo truly be compaſſionated as a man who hath not even <hi>policy</hi> enough to be <hi>honeſt,</hi> yet he is certainly an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of moral diſapprobation; and tho' it may be very proper to pity him, it is equally proper that, for the ſake of an example, and for the ſervice of mankind, he ſhould be puniſhed. A criminal pleaded upon

his trial, as an extenuation of his offence, that he was <hi>predeſtined</hi> to commit it: I am heartily ſorry for that friend, ſaid the judge, but by the ſame rule, I am predeſtined to order you to be hanged. Breaking a leg is aſſuredly a pitiable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but, in point of culpability, ſhall it be equally immoral with want of honeſty? Nor did I ever know before that, want of <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> was to be imputed to a man, as criminal, though it may ſometimes be attributed to his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or want of application.—Again, can a <hi>whole</hi> leg be called a corporcal <hi>virtue;</hi> or can a broken one be termed with any propriety, a corporeal <hi>vice?</hi> Corporeal virtues,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0673203200:166"/>
muſt be perſonal virtues; ſuch as charity, cleanlineſs, continence, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething ſo unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this ſentence, Sir, that I ſhould eſteem myſelf very much obliged to you if you would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with your <note n="*" place="bottom">Poſtſcript to Letter, p. 38.</note> learned friend, who drew up a comprehenſive ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of Hume's doctrines, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to that paſſage in our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher's Works which treats of this matter.</p>
            <p>I beg references alſo, by help of the ſame medium, to thoſe parts of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0673203200:167"/>
Hume, which is, you ſay, <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter, p. 28.</note> "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to prove the <hi>ſoul's mortality,"</hi> an attempt which I cannot with the cloſeſt attention perceive, was ever made. Hints about his juſtification of <hi>ſelf-murder,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">London Review.</note> are, as ſome cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics have already obſerved, "candour itſelf requires, we ſhould not attack a work, which the Author himſelf had abandoned, and in ſome meaſure reprobated."</p>
            <p>By way of contraſt to the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Mr. Hume, you lay before us, for the choice of our adoption, the behaviour of Hooker the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.—I am curious to know the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0673203200:168"/>
reaſons for propoſing Hooker as a contraſt to Hume.—Was there any thing in the conduct of their laſt moments which ſo materially diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed them? Let us draw the curtain, and obſerve.</p>
            <p>Immediately before the Author of the Eccleſiaſtical Polity expired, he ſpake thus:</p>
            <p>"I have lived to ſee, that this world is made up of perturbations; and I have been long preparing to leave it, and gathering comfort for the dreadful hour of making my account with God, which I now apprehend to be near. And though I have, by his grace, loved him in my youth, and feared him in mine
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0673203200:169"/>
age, and laboured to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence, towards him, and towards all men, yet, if thou, Lord, ſhouldeſt be extreme to mark what I have done amiſs, who can abide it? And therefore, where I have failed, Lord, ſhew mercy to me; for I plead not my righteouſneſs, but the forgiveneſs of my unrighteouſneſs, through His merits, who died to purchaſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for penitent ſinners. And ſince I owe thee a death, Lord, let it not be terrible, and then take thine own time; I ſubmit to it. Let not mine, O Lord, but thy will be done!—God hath heard my daily petitions; for I am at peace with all men, and he is at peace with
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0673203200:170"/>
me. From ſuch bleſſed aſſurance I feel that inward joy, which this world can neither give, nor take from me. My conſcience beareth me this witneſs; and this witneſs makes the thoughts of death joyful. I could wiſh to live, to do the Church more ſervice; but cannot hope it; for my days are paſt, as a ſhadow that returns not."</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Life, p. 42.</note> When Hume's ſymptoms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with violence upon him, he from that moment gave up all thoughts of recovery, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the utmoſt chearfulneſs, and the moſt perfect reſignation and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0673203200:171"/>
complacency: <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Smith's Letter, p. 51.</note> he always talked of his approaching diſſolution with great cheerfulneſs, but never affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make any parade of his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity. When even the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his friends became oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and fatiguing, he was quite free from <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Smith's Letter, p. 54.</note> anxiety, or impatience. Even the laſt ſtage of his diſorder, when it even coſt him an effort to ſpeak, and when he had occaſion to addreſs the <note n="‡" place="bottom">Dr. Smith's Letter, p. 58.</note> people about him, he always did it with affection and tenderneſs.—After all this he died "in ſuch a happy compoſure of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0673203200:172"/>
mind, that nothing could exceed it."</p>
            <p>I look in vain for a <hi>diſtinct differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> between the laſt moments of Hume and Hooker, Sir. Did Hooker "labour to be at peace with all men?" So did Hume, who had "<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Smith's Letter to Mr. Strahan, p. 48.</note> no enemies on which he wiſhed to revenge himſelf." Did Hooker live to ſee, that, "<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter, p. 32.</note> this world is made up of perturbations?" So did Hume, who—though the later period of his life was the moſt agreeable to him, and though he ſaw many ſymptoms of his literary
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0673203200:173"/>
reputation breaking out at laſt with additional luſtre—conſidered that, "<note n="*" place="bottom">Life, p. 31.</note> a man of ſixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties," inſomuch that he declares, almoſt with his dying breath, that, "it would be difficult to be more detached from life" than he was at that criſis.</p>
            <p>Point out to me then, I conjure you, Sir, the ſuperiority in the manner of Hooker's dying. I own I cannot, without ſome peculiar aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, find it out. And, I truſt, likewiſe, that ſuch readers of my APOLOGY, as are neither, "<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter, p. 2</note> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0673203200:174"/>
enthuſiaſts, nor enemies to human learning," will be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the influences of the philoſophy which are the object of our preſent diſpute, were in no degree <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter, p. 30.</note> peſtilential.</p>
            <p>From what has been already urged, you will perceive, Sir, that I by no means think that your Letter to Dr. Adam Smith is <note n="†" place="bottom">It were no difficult matter, to prove alſo that you have not written <hi>ingeniouſly;</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral groſs blunders, which even hurry can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excuſe, occurring in different parts of your pamphlet. Thus, in Advertiſement, p. 1. you "made your remarks, becauſe you thought them true." What, Sir, "did you think them true <hi>before</hi> the thoughts were made." P. 4. of Letter, you uſe the word <hi>proportion</hi> for portion, by which miſtake the paſſage is truly ridiculous. P. 4. you ſay you never knew what hatred was? No 1 What, do not you hate vice, and the villain? Good, meek, milky-minded man, the friends of virtue and honeſty are much obliged to you for that truly! P. 10. you talk facetiouſly of <hi>dying</hi> as inſenſibly and fooliſhly as you can for the <hi>life</hi> of you: you ſay you are a <hi>South Britain.</hi> Who would not have thought you were juſt exported from the banks of the Shannon? P. 14. is the word <hi>yourſelf</hi> for the word <hi>you,</hi> and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious other errors—not of the preſs, but,—to adopt your own language—" theſe are trifles; my quarry lies not this way. I fly at nobler game. The atrocious cruelty of inſiſting that a writer diffuſed <hi>Athoiſm,</hi> who never <hi>did</hi> diffuſe any ſuch thing, is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that concerns every body."</note> 
               <hi>ingenuouſly</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0673203200:175"/>
written; nor do I think the Doctor's deceaſed friend, will very cordially
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0673203200:176"/>
accept ſervices, ſo maliciouſly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, even <note n="†" place="bottom">Letter, p. 30.</note> IF (as you cautiouſly obſerve) departed ſpirits <hi>have</hi> any knowledge of what is paſſing upon earth.</p>
            <p>After all, Sir, how can you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your pen ſuch a licence—a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, you would not dared to have indulged, had the philoſopher been in the land of the living—as to ſay that his exiſtence was paſſed <note n="‡" place="bottom">Letter, p 32.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world? Though his
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0673203200:177"/>
notions of a ſupreme Power might not perhaps directly tally with yours, how are you able to tell that ſuch a power did not as highly approve his arguments as your own? Would you pronounce a ſentence of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt the Indian for his worſhip to the ſun—againſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan for his homage to the Prophet—againſt the Chineſe for his idolatry to a ſculptured image—againſt the Perſian for his proſtration to a cloud? All theſe people have different ideas of a a Deity from you.—None of theſe are Chriſtians—Millions of them believe <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter, p. 31.</note> nothing about the Son—Many of them are, moral, ſocial,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0673203200:178"/>
pious, humane, charitable—Shall they, nevertheleſs, not ſee life, but ſhall the wrath of God, ſo furiouſly denounced by St. John, abide on them?</p>
            <p>I am ſhocked at ſuch a ſyſtem. Yet the caſe is parallel. Fie upon it, Sir. It is not the part of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian paſtor to be extreme to mark even what is done amiſs, nor is it characteriſtic either of a follower of Jeſus, or of a ſervant of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father, to ſnatch from the hand of that father,</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay on Man.</note>—"the ballance or the rod."</p>
            <p>Although, you have taken upon you to "rejudge his juſtice, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0673203200:179"/>
be the God of God." All that part of your Letter, therefore, Sir, which would repreſent Mr. Hume as unworthy the mercy, or protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Providence, is arrogant, inſolent, ignorant, and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</p>
            <p>But, to ſay the truth, and do you full juſtice, you ſeem, Sir, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs a notable talent for miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſentiments of thoſe whom you are pleaſed to cenſure. I am ſorry to find you do not think Dr. Smith's <hi>good meaning</hi> will ſucceed; becauſe,—without the leaſt mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of your beloved irony—I really think his deſign was perfectly laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0673203200:180"/>
I ſee nothing wrong in his perſuading us to follow the example of David Hume, becauſe, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, not a ſyllable that propoſes Atheiſm as a cordial for low ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the proper antidote againſt the fear of death. If <hi>you</hi> perceive ſuch ſentiments, I again repeat, that, it becomes you, Sir, as a fair-deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian, who ought to do juſtice betwixt man and man, to be more particular in your references, and not to be <q>laughing wild In <hi>merry</hi> madneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Your ſmile of John the Painter is very elevated, indeed, and ſoars ſuperior to all reply: I am not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0673203200:181"/>
and accept, very good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouredly, your declaration of <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter, p. 5.</note> meaning no harm. The misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is, that I am afraid you will do no good. Your pamphlet, like what <hi>you</hi> take to be Mr. Hume's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the ſoul—a thing by the bye which he never mentions—<note n="†" place="bottom">Letter, p. 39.</note> is not one, but many things, and being a jumble of many things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, is, ultimately, nothing at all. You more than once, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Letter, p. 42.</note> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert your own hypotheſis, and prove, by your ungracious manner of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, that by ſuch argument no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be proved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0673203200:182"/>
Theſe, Sir, among many other reaſons, induce me not to ſpeak quite ſo <note n="*" place="bottom">Advertiſement to Letter, p. 2.</note> handſomely of you as I could wiſh; and theſe are alſo my motives for refuſing to introduce you to my kinsfolk, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, Sir, after accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately examining your Letter to Dr. Smith, and carefully re-conſidering the whole ſubject of the preceding APOLOGY in canſequence of it, I am able to conclude with an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of your <hi>own cloſing expreſſions,</hi> and of my motto, namely, that, "<note n="†" place="bottom">See Advertiſement, p. 4.</note> on reviewing what I have written,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0673203200:183"/>
I really cannot ſee there is any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for me to alter, or to add an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſentence."</p>
