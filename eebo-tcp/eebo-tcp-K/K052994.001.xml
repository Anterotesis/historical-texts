            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O improve the Underſtanding in any Branch of uſeful Knowledge, has ever been eſteemed a laudable Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; and every Attempt to facilitate the Propagation of Knowledge, in Proportion to the Nature and Importance of the Subject, and the Propriety of the Method, will, it is preſumed, meet with Approbation and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>
            <p>To obtain a Skill in the Sciences is, indeed, the Buſineſs and Profeſſion only of a few Men of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Abilities; but there are many who have Capacity and Leiſure to improve and enrich their Minds in various Branches of Knowledge; even the lower Order of Men have particular Callings and Concerns in Life, in which it behoves them to employ their Reaſon in the Uſe of proper Helps for their Improvement.</p>
            <p>The common Duties and Benefits of Society, which intereſt every Man living, as he is a ſocial Creature; even our particular and neceſſary Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a Family, a Neighbourhood, or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, oblige all Perſons to exerciſe their reaſoning Powers in a Variety of Caſes, before they can come
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0010800101:3"/>to a prudent diſcreet Determination, and avoid thoſe Errors which would naturally be attended with unhappy Conſequences.</p>
            <p>But every Man has a more important Concern in the Affairs of a Life to come; and therefore it is a Matter of the higheſt Moment for every one to underſtand, to reaſon, and to determine juſtly about the Things of Religion: 'Tis in vain for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in general to ſay, We have no Leiſure or Time; when the daily Intervals and Vacancies from neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Labour, together with the One Day in Seven, in the Chriſtian World, allow a ſufficient Time for ſuch Purſuits: And if Men would but apply themſelves hereto, with half as much Zeal and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence as they do to the Trifles and Amuſements of this Life, it would turn to infinitely better Account.</p>
            <p>But, beſides the right Knowledge of thoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Duties which are of the greateſt Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there are ſome Branches of Study, which have a moſt apparent Tendency to entertain as well as to improve; and, of this Kind, ſome Subjects of Hiſtory will claim the Preference; and, perhaps, there is no Part of Hiſtory better received than the Account of great Changes and Revolutions in States and Governments.</p>
            <p>Of all Changes, thoſe in Religion which have been ſudden and ſignal, are enquired into with the moſt eager Curioſity; and, where the Salvation of Souls has been chiefly aimed at, and the Credit, Honour and Intereſt of Churches promoted and eſtabliſhed, the more Pious and Judicious will find their Satisfaction much more than compenſate the ſeeming Trouble of their Search into the Reality and Circumſtances thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0010800101:4"/>The Alteration that has been made in the eſtabliſhed Religion of this Nation for little more than the two laſt Centuries, has produced ſuch Effects every where, that it is no Wonder if all Perſons deſire to ſee a clear Account of the ſeveral Steps by which it advanced; of the Councils that directed it, and the Motives, both religious and political, that inclined Men of all Conditions to concur in it.</p>
            <p>To lay before the Public a particular and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Account of the Conſtitution and Doctrine of the ſeveral Denominations of Chriſtians, is the principal Intent of this Undertaking; and, upon the moſt mature Enquiry I have been able to make, I find the Doctrines and Tenets of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations to have varied greatly from their original Conſtitution, and diſtinguiſhing Character.</p>
            <p>This Obſervation will appear to be true, even with reſpect to the <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> Church, which has been moſt of all ſolicitous to preſerve the <hi>Catholic</hi> Faith, as they call it, pure and uncorrupt. The wiſer Part diſclaim ſome of their moſt abſurd Doctrines, and diſcard and deſpiſe many of their ridiculous Ceremonies: Some Reformation has been made in theſe Reſpects by Churches of that Perſuaſion in different Nations of <hi>Europe;</hi> and it is more than probable that many of the moſt ſerious and judicious Papiſts would be glad to ſee a greater Reformation even in the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of their Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Picart,</hi> under the Article of adoring the Croſs, ſays, "This Ceremony gives great Scandal to <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,</hi> who look upon this ſolemn Adoration on Good Friday as manifeſt Idolatry—would it not be better to decline ſome Ceremonies which <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics</hi> are reduced to Shifts, Diſguiſes, and Evaſions
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0010800101:5"/>to defend, and which are looked on as Folly to the Libertine, and a Scandal to the Proteſtant?"
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Picart</hi>'s Edition of the <hi>Religious Ceremonies,</hi> Vol. II. P. 25.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the Church of <hi>England</hi> it is well known great Alterations have taken place ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: At that Time the generality of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines, eſpecially the Majority of the Committee for Compiling the Articles of this Church, were ſtrict or rigid Calviniſts, who, in Spite of all the Oppoſition they met with, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled ſeveral of the Articles in Favour of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſm, which now the greateſt Part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines would fain explain contrary to their literal Senſe and Meaning; repreſent them as, at beſt, ambiguous and capable of a Senſe more conſiſtent with the general Tenour of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Reaſon and common Senſe of Mankind.—In like Manner <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Creed was then, by Authority, inſerted in the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, and, with all the incomprehenſible Myſteries and exceptionable Clauſes, cordially received by ſome, and impoſed on others, as the true <hi>Catholic</hi> Faith; whereas now, to ſay no more to explode it, the Church in general "would be glad to be well rid of it." If the Queſtion were aſked, What are the genuine Sentiments of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> it would be a very vague, indeterminate and falſe Anſwer, to ſay they are contained in the XXXIX Articles; when it is well known that the Majority of our moſt eminent Prelates and Divines of the eſtabliſhed Church, have embraced and profeſſed, and in their public Preaching and Writings endeavour to inculcate, Principles more conſiſtent with the Nature of genuine Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>The ſame Obſervation is equally true, with reſpect to many other Denominations, namely the
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0010800101:6"/>Kirk or Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, Baptiſts, Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> as would be no difficult Matter to particularize in many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, were it not unneceſſary, as will evidently appear in the Courſe of this Work.</p>
            <p>This may be one Reaſon why all the Hiſtories extant, of the ſeveral Sectaries of Chriſtians, differ ſo widely from each other, and are ſo very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and erroneous: I wiſh this was the only Reaſon, and that there did not appear ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Marks of a malevolent Deſign to miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Sectaries, in order to expoſe them to Cenſure and Contempt. This I hint with particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>Roſs</hi>'s View of all Religions, being, of all others, the moſt ſcurrilous and falſe; and to that voluminous Edition of the Religious Ceremonies of all Nations, in which the Author appears greatly miſtaken in the Conſtitution and Principles of ſeveral Societies of <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant Diſſenters;</hi> and alſo to <hi>Boſſuet</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Variation of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches in the <hi>Low Countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Crime of Miſrepreſentation is not applicable only to a few Hiſtories of our own or foreign Nations, and thoſe for the moſt part obſolete: Certain modern Writers ſeem to have taken a ſecret Pleaſure in blackening the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of ſome Societies of Chriſtians, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and cenſuring ſuch Doctrines or Rites as they learned not in their Infancy to believe or practiſe; forgetting, though aſhamed to deny, the Right of private Judgment, and Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and too often ignorant of the genuine Principles of thoſe Societies they cenſure, and of the Arguments upon which they are founded. Indeed I have been often ſurprized to find Perſons
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0010800101:7"/>of Credit, and otherwiſe of good Underſtanding, ſo extremely ignorant, not only with reſpect to the genuine Sentiments of other Denominations of Chriſtians; but in a very high Degree, of the diſtinguiſhing Tenets or Principles of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they themſelves profeſs; and conſequently of the Arguments on which they reſt. This was one Motive to the Proſecution of the preſent Work; and another was to ſuppreſs Bigotry, Prejudice, and Cenſoriouſneſs, too apt to take Poſſeſſion of narrow Minds; and, in their Place, to inculcate and improve that mutual Love and Charity, even for Perſons of differing Opinions, which is ſo agreeable to the Dignity and Honour of Men and of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>I write for no Party; my Aim is to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a free and impartial Enquiry into the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Principles of Chriſtianity, which is the juſt Foundation of Truth and Virtue, Liberty and Charity.</p>
            <p>That generally-received Maxim, <hi>Rome was not built in a Day,</hi> is as undoubtedly true with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Conſtitution, Doctrine and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, as of its external Form and ſtately Edifices; for this Reaſon I have judged a brief Account of the principal Revolutions and Variations in the Government, Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of that Church for ſeventeen Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, a proper Preliminary to the Hiſtory of its preſent State.</p>
            <p>The Account I have given of the Principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, I have firſt expreſſed in the Words of Pope <hi>Pius</hi>'s Creed, which was eſtabliſhed by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and has been ever ſince
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0010800101:8"/>eſteemed by the Votaries of that Church, of the greateſt Authority. I have likewiſe endeavoured to explain or aſcertain their true Senſe, from Authors of their own, well approved of by that Church, and whoſe Books have been licenſed by public Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; diſclaiming and carefully avoiding, as much as poſſible, the fallacious Gloſſes, and artful Diſguiſes of deſigning Prieſts on the one Hand, and the Miſapprehenſions of the Vulgar on the other. For this Purpoſe I have conſulted the moſt valuable Hiſtories of that Church, their Conſtitution, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Ceremonies publiſhed at that remarkable Period, when the Controverſy ſubſiſted between ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our eminent Prelates and of their Prieſts and Cardinals from the Year 1682 to 1688, incluſive.</p>
            <p>I have alſo made ſeveral Extracts from Dr. <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton</hi>'s Letters from <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein he has ſhewn, (conformable to ſeveral other Authors) that many of the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church were of Heathen original, and deſtitute of ſuperior Authority for their Practice: In theſe Extracts, I have not thought it neceſſary to Change his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, to avoid the Reprehenſion of thoſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Ceremonies; nor have I allowed myſelf to exclaim or to detail out ſuch Invectives as are too generally uſed, but have no proper and natural Tendency to convince the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or confirm the <hi>Proteſtant.</hi>—If I have given any Scope to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it is in the Article of Perſecution, where it was impoſſible, after reading ſo many tragical Accounts of the horrid Cruelties of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human Executions, to be impartial and honeſt without expreſſing the utmoſt Abhorrence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of ſuch Practices, and the Principles that led to them; a ſuperficial Mention of which, will alarm every true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> who has ever conſidered
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0010800101:9"/>the Value of civil and religious Liberty and knows how to prize them.—With Reſpect to other Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Practices that are unſcriptural and mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of human Invention, I am ſorry to ſee, in the Defences of Popery, how much they are founded upon the Authority of ancient Fathers, and that they are ſo often ſhewn to be conſonant with ſome former Practices of our eſtabliſhed Church; with certain of the Canons, Articles, and Liturgy; which may fully convince us, that moſt of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable Parts of our Articles and Liturgy aroſe from the undue Veneration which the Compilers of them paid to the Fathers St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe, &amp;c.</hi> and likewiſe ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the impartial Reader, that <hi>Antiquity is a wretched Guide to a Searcher after Truth; and that human Formularies of Faith are a chief Obſtacle to real Knowledge.</hi>

            <p>As to the political Views, baſe Artifices, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, too much of it will appear in the Courſe of this Hiſtory: An impartial Mention of them is in Fact to explode them: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the Hiſtory of the State of Religion in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> from the firſt planting of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at the latter End of the VIth and Beginning of the VIIth Century, to the Middle of the XIVth Century, when <hi>Wickliffe</hi> made ſome Efforts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Reformation. The Reader will find many remarkable Occurrences, in Reſpect to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings, and the common Rights of their Subjects, as well as by the groſs Corruptions of the original Purity and Simplicity of Chriſtianity, as muſt ever be deemed peculiar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, to throw off that
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0010800101:10"/>Yoke if poſſible, and purſue a Reformation in earneſt—and at the ſame Time, he will obſerve ſuch Difficulties attending it, as muſt give us an high Opinion of our principal Reformers, and lead us to value our Liberties both civil and religious.</p>
            <p>In the Hiſtory of the Reformation abroad and at home, and of the State of Religion, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the eſtabliſhed Church, and from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Period to the Revolution, I muſt own I have much exceeded my intended Limits; but when I conſidered, the neceſſary Connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Reformation in the <hi>Low Countries, France,</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> the many intereſting Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that occurred, in which our principal Reformers were exhibited to View (which indeed deſerve to be ever preſerved, and handed down to lateſt Poſterity) and which I doubt not will be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed by many, with Pleaſure and Improvement, I was not willing to omit them.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned <hi>Wickliffe</hi> as the <hi>Morning Star</hi> of the Reformation, I have likewiſe given a general Hiſtory of the Period in which he lived, to the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth, the reputed Time when Proteſtantiſm took its Riſe: In this Interval I have found many Circumſtances of an intereſting Nature relative to the neceſſity of a Reformation, the Difficulties attending it, and likewiſe of inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Occurrences contributing thereto, which, at Length, made it riſe ſuperior to Oppoſition. How far the Reformation was intended or effected by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, is a Point in which even critical Hiſtorians are much divided: I have therefore ſought the Materials of this difficult Part of my Hiſtory, from ancient MSS, as well as modern Tracts; and I have been ſomewhat more diffuſe in
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0010800101:11"/>this Part, as I have ſelected from two MSS, his Profeſſion of Faith wrote in 1536, and <hi>Memoirs of his Character,</hi> compiled much about the ſame Time.</p>
            <p>My next Province is to give a Hiſtory of the State of Religion in the ſucceſſive Reigns, down to the preſent Time, in which I have been careful to introduce whatever has been ſignal and intereſting, either in the eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of the eſtabliſhed Church, or of ſuch remarkable Tranſactions and Revolutions, in the civil Hiſtory of this Nation, as are connected with it for more than two Hundred Years, and as the prevailing Opinions and Parties, gave Riſe at different Times, to a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Tranſactions in Council, in Parliament, and eccleſiaſtic Convocations, ſome of a remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting Nature, I thought them the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ſuch an Hiſtory: But as many of them are peculiar to different Denominations, that Part of them I have inſerted in the reſpective Hiſtory of thoſe Sects, and what properly relate to the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Polity and Government of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> comes under that Head.</p>
            <p>In the Proſecution of this Part, I have attempted ſome Account of the Princes, and moſt eminent Prelates and Divines, whoſe Lives and Writings have done Honour to the Chriſtian Proteſtant Church, and alſo of ſuch as have attempted to ſap the Foundation of Truth, Liberty and Virtue.</p>
            <p>In treating of the Articles of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I have firſt given them in the eſtabliſhed Form, contained in the Book of Common Prayer; I have then endeavoured to give their true Senſe, from ſundry of the moſt approved Expoſitions of thoſe Articles, by ſome diſtinguiſhed Prelates of
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0010800101:12"/>our Church, and other Divines of Note, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by Extracts in their own Words; ſave where I have thought it might be more properly abridged, and in that Caſe I have given an Abſtract, with due Regard to the Senſe and Meaning of the Author, and of the Articles in their original Form, in a Senſe in which the more judicious Divines would recommend them to be underſtood.—Mr. <hi>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> in his Expoſition of theſe Articles, pays a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Regard to the Senſe of the ancient Fathers, St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> St. <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus, &amp;c.</hi> and it appears that the Language and Sentiment contained in them, are in great Meaſure borrowed from the Writings of thoſe Lights of the primitive Church, which, by the Way, ſhews the great Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Eſteem our firſt Compilers had for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and very often to the Neglect of more certain, eſſential and important Rules and Principles of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, concerning the Truths of the ſacred Scriptures: But this is only a Hint; for I muſt declare that I have made it a general Rule, throughout the whole of this Work, to relate Facts and deſcribe Things as I found them, without attempting to animadvert thereon.</p>
            <p>In repreſenting the Conſtitution and Doctrines of other Denominations of Chriſtians, I have made it my conſtant Rule to ſhew that I underſtood the Subject, and was under no undue Biaſs. Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality I eſteemed eſſentially recommendatory of this Work, and the beſt Apology I could make for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever involuntary Errors and Imperfections might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Publication.</p>
            <p>Throughout the Whole I have aimed at Conciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as far as I judged would comport with the Plan I had in View, its Entertainment and Uſefulneſs;
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0010800101:13"/>for I have characterized each Sect and explained their Doctrines, more eſpecially their peculiar Tenets, where I could, in their own Words.— This Method will afford not a barely ſuperficial and partial Account of what may be the particular Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of here and there a private Perſon and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Society; but of the genuine Principles of that Body or Community, which is neceſſary to forming a juſt Idea of them; and whenever it has been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, I have had proper Information from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, or given a perſonal Attendance at their Aſſemblies and taken Minutes, for greater certainty and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Amongſt a Variety of Readers I cannot expect the Approbation of all. Some there are ſo extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indifferent, with reſpect to the principal Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Sentiment among Chriſtians, as plainly implies they have never made Religion their Study, or that their own Profeſſion is not the Effect of their Enquiry; but that they are governed in their Choice, by the Dictates of their Tutors, or the Sanction of Authority; and to ſuch, Popery would, probably, have been as agreeable as Proteſtantiſm, or Mahomedaniſm as Chriſtianity, if it had been their Lot to have been born in the Countries where theſe are eſtabliſhed. I ſhall leave them to enjoy their ſupine Indifference; but not without ſincerely congratulating my Countrymen, on our diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Privilege, that we live in a Nation and at a Time, when Religion has in great Meaſure gained the Aſcendant over Superſtition; Truth in general prevailed againſt Darkneſs and Error, and Liberty, civil and religious, triumphed over Tyranny and Perſecution for Conſcience ſake: And for theſe I
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0010800101:14"/>hope we ſhall always find Patrons and Advocates, amongſt the more Learned and Judicious.</p>
            <p>By ſome it has been ſuggeſted that this Work will be too dull and ſerious, and ſavour too much of the controverted Points of Religion; to ſuch I beg leave to obſerve, I have not often attempted to animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or expatiate on particular Opinions or Practices, that was not my Province; but to give a genuine Relation of ſuch Facts as appertain to the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and theſe are, I preſume, as well calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to improve the Gentleman, and give Life and Spirit to Converſation, at proper Intervals, as any other Subjects more commonly introduced; and where ſuch a Variety of Facts, Circumſtances and Characters are introduced, I cannot apprehend it will be unentertaining or uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>By attempting ſuch a Compendium of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Principles of particular Denominations, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined I might particularly adapt this Work to the peruſal of many young Perſons, and other well diſpoſed Chriſtians, who may not have Leiſure or Inclination to read many diſtinct Treatiſes, and it may anſwer a particular good Purpoſe, in regard to their Information and Improvement.</p>
            <p>As this Work was not entered upon with any party Views, or proſecuted with Prejudice and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, ſo it has been no haſty Production; it has been compiled at different Times, and by ſlow Degrees, in a Courſe of ſeveral Years; now and then, indeed, it ſpread itſelf into Branches, and Leaves, like a Plant in <hi>April,</hi> and ſometimes it lay by without Growth like a Vegetable in Winter; but it ſtill exiſted, and acquired its preſent Texture and Bulk according as Health, Leiſure, and other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages favoured the Undertaking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0010800101:15"/>Nor do I apprehend the Reader will look upon this as a prolix Hiſtory, when he conſiders not only the Extent of the Plan, but that many of the Hiſtories neceſſary to be conſulted are very volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; as <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s, <hi>Dupin</hi>'s, <hi>Bingham</hi>'s, and <hi>Collier</hi>'s eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories; <hi>Richer</hi>'s of Councils, Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s of that of <hi>Trent, Picart</hi>'s religious Ceremonies, and the Collections of Tracts for and againſt Popery, <hi>Brandt</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Reformation in the <hi>Low Countries, Burnet</hi>'s and many others, of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Laval</hi>'s of that in <hi>France; Calderwood</hi>'s, <hi>Spotſwood</hi>'s, and diverſe others of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland; Sewel</hi>'s of <hi>Quakeriſm; Neal</hi>'s of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and <hi>Croſby</hi>'s of the <hi>Engliſh Baptiſts:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a great Variety of Tracts on Points of Controverſy, Dictionaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that muſt be refered to, and conſulted, on ſuch a Number of Subjects; <hi>Rapin, Hume, Smollet,</hi> and other civil Hiſtorians of our own Nation, neceſſary for aſcertaining and illuſtrating all ſuch Matters, as have an immediate Connection with the principal Deſign of this Work. So that, upon the Whole, I may venture to ſay, it has been an arduous Taſk, the reſult of much Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Enquiry. But notwithſtanding the Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance I have received, from ſo many eminent Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, I have followed no Author any farther than I apprehended him to coincide with Truth.</p>
            <p>After having been at all this Expence and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to procure Materials and proper Helps for the Execution of my Plan, it is very probable and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unavoidable, that many Things may have eſcaped my notice, which might have contributed to illuſtrate, confirm, or embelliſh the ſeveral Parts of it. I can only flatter myſelf that the Reader will find a ſufficient Number of Quotations to aſcertain
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0010800101:16"/>the genuine Principles of the ſeveral Societies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, their Rites, Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which I have given the following Hiſtory. And I hope the judicious Reader will look on it as no Dimuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Value of this Work, that many of the Ideas, as well as the Language, in which they are expreſſed, are borrowed from the Writings of the moſt eminent Divines of the eſtabliſhed Church, and other Denominations, eſpecially as, in many Inſtances, it was neceſſary for authenticating the Account I gave of the different Sectaries; and, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often, I found my Sentiments ſo happily expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in them, that I preſumed from my own Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation it would be moſt agreeable to my Readers.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not urge as any Motive to this Work, that I apprehended Popery was gaining Ground in this Nation; but as that Religion is founded in Church Policy, and propagated with Artifice and Induſtry by their Prieſts, and is ſuited to captivate weak Minds, it cannot be unſeaſonable to point out ſome of their Evaſions, and to give a genuine Account of their Conſtitution, Doctrines, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this I judge will be ſufficient, if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially repreſented, and attended to, to guard Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants againſt the Corruption, Superſtition, and Cruelty of the <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>Nor am I inclined to think a Spirit of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prevails among Proteſtants, or of uncharitably cenſuring Perſons for different Sentiments and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: I wiſh, indeed, this was more evident; for I find ſome Authors ſuggeſt, that this Principle is far from being extinguiſhed, and that many rather want Opportunity than Inclination to perſecute, and inſtance the high Claims of the Church, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered themſelves in the <hi>Bangorian</hi> Controverſy;
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0010800101:17"/>I am, notwithſtanding, willing to hope a Love of Liberty prevails, and to promote it, I have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in my Introduction, to vindicate the Right of private Judgment, and ſhew the Duty and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of free Enquiry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I rather think what is called <hi>Methodiſm</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> prevails, to the Contempt of rational Religion; and, as I have taken Care to give a fair Account of their peculiar Tenets, I wiſh for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than that the juſt Repreſentation of their Principles may have a proper Influence on the Minds of my Readers.</p>
            <p>In the Courſe of this Hiſtory, I doubt not but it will appear, that the principal Differences amongſt the ſeveral Denominations of Proteſtant Churches, conſiſts not in any eſſential and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Points, but in one or other of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <hi>viz.</hi> different Apprehenſions, with reſpect to the original Conſtitution and Government of the Chriſtian Church; different Sentiments with reſpect to ſome abſtruſe Points of Doctrine, in which the Eſſence of Religion does not, cannot conſiſt; or elſe their Difference reſpects the poſitive Inſtitutions, as to their Form and Manner, Importance or Inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficance, or of certain Rites and Ceremonies of leſs Importance; and that notwithſtanding their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Communion, and very often reproaching each other, they agree in the main eſſential Points of Religion, in "all ſuch Points as are abundantly ſufficient to preſerve the Knowledge and Practice of Religion in the World."

            <p>Indeed many Attempts have been made, ſince the Reformation, and eſpecially ſince the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to reconcile Proteſtants; a Deſign which,
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0010800101:18"/>however laudable, can never be effected with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Uniformity of Sentiment: The Cauſes of ſuch differing Principles, reſpecting Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Ceremonies, are ſo many and various, that we cannot hope for it, though, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fond Attachment of many to their own Sects, the moſt impartial Enquiry convince us that <hi>no Sect of Religion is free from juſt Exceptions.</hi> There is ſcarce any Church in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> at this Day, that does not obtrude many Falſhoods, ſuch as muſt appear to any free Spirit, pure Contradictions; though delivered with the ſame Gravity, Authority and Importunity that they do the Holy Oracles of GOD.

            <p>"Every Inſtitution or Syſtem of Religion, drawn up and adopted by Men, however it may claim a divine Original, with regard to the more important and eſſential Points, has always ſomething of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Imperfection that cleave to them, and will be apt, unleſs carefully guarded, to degenerate into one Extreme or the other.—What Species of Devotion ſo pure, noble and worthy the ſupreme Being, as that which is moſt ſpiritual, ſimple and unadorned, and which partakes leaſt of the Senſes or Imagination; and yet it is found, by Experience, that Modes of Worſhip, founded primarily on thoſe very Principles, do very naturally, among the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, mount up into Extravagance and Fanaticiſm; even many of the firſt Reformers have given Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for this Kind of Reflection, which has been a real Diſparagement of their Zeal, though in the Event it proved in a very great Degree uſeful: It
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0010800101:19"/>partook ſtrongly of the enthuſiaſtic Genius, which a little more Mixture of Ceremony, Pomp and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, may ſeem to correct the Abuſe of.— On the other Hand, a Religion attended with much of Ceremony and external Grandeur, has a very great Tendency to degenerate into Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—The Church of <hi>England</hi> itſelf, which is, perhaps, the beſt Medium amongſt theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, will be allowed, at leaſt during the Age, or in the Diſcharge of the public Offices of Religion, under Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> to have been ſomewhat tinctured with a Superſtition reſembling the Popiſh, and to have paid a higher Regard to ſome poſitive Inſtitutions, than the Nature of the Things ſtrictly ſpeaking would permit. It is the Buſineſs of an Hiſtorian to remark theſe Abuſes of all Kinds; but it belongs alſo to a prudent Reader, to confine the Repreſentations to that Age alone of which the Author treats.—This would be of excellent Uſe to regulate our Ideas of ſeveral Sectaries; for it is a real Abſurdity to ſuppoſe that the <hi>Preſbyterians, Independents, Baptiſts,</hi> and other Sectaries of the preſent Age, partake of all the Extravagancies which we remark in thoſe who bore thoſe Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the laſt Century."</p>
            <p>It is very common for Hiſtorians, or other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in general, to give an Account of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Authors who have treated on the ſame Subjects; and where this is done with Judgment and Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, it has an apparent Uſefulneſs: And this is, in ſome Meaſure, neceſſary on my Part; though I will not in the leaſt attempt to raiſe the Credit of the preſent Hiſtory, by detracting from the Merits of others.—Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> has characterized a Variety of Authors who have given us the Hiſtory
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0010800101:20"/>of the Church in general, or of the Reformation in particular, which I apprehend, without Flattery, may afford us ſome Rule of Judging concerning them: Speaking of ſome foreign Hiſtories, he ſays, "<hi>Sleidan, Thuanus,</hi> and Father <hi>Paul,</hi> are Authors of Credit and Impartiality, ſo far, at leaſt, as may be expected from Perſons of their Profeſſion, as Catholics.—<hi>Sander</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſtead of doing Honour to it, is replete with ſuch Calumnies and Falſhoods, as have tended to create Prejudices in the Minds of many, who have been weak enough to give Credit to it. <hi>Fox</hi>'s Hiſtory, is principally calculated to diſcover the Corruptions and Cruelties of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church; Lord <hi>Herbert</hi>'s Hiſtory is limited to the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and chiefly relates to civil Matters. <hi>Fuller,</hi> indeed, procured ſome few ſcarce Papers; but in general neither entertaining nor improving. —Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> wrote in a much ſuperior Method and Stile, but was ill informed, or too much biaſſed by Paſſion and Prejudice againſt ſome Perſons and Parties, who agitated Affairs at that Time; and in the hiſtorical Part produces few or no Vouchers for what he aſſerts. Some other of our Hiſtories are delivered with ſo much Alloy and Uncertainty, as has given Occaſion for the Advocates of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to diſparage the Reformation, as <hi>begun by Luſt and Paſſion, conducted and carried on by Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and confirmed by Policy.</hi>"

            <p>Some very remarkable Productions of this Kind have come under my Notice: The <hi>Appendix to the Profeſſion of Catholic Faith</hi> contain ſundry Reaſons for diſavowing Proteſtantiſm, or the Reformation; though many of them ſo often repeated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, that one would imagine them too trifling to be propagated at this Time, when the Neceſſity of the Reformation, ſo far as it was effected, and the Expediency of carrying it much farther, has been ſo well defended. It conſiſts of the following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and other Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, were Perſons of no Education; that they were Schiſmatics; the firſt Seeds of it ſown by the Devil; the Inſtruments, Men of worthleſs Characters, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII; that it was propagated by Lay Authority, further inſtanced in the Acts of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> the Fruits of it a Spawn of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Diſſenſions, and Variations in Religion: Thence it infers, their Religion is free from all thoſe miſerable Conſequences, the ſafeſt to live and to die in; and that all who do not live in it, and abide faithfully in that Profeſſion, are cenſured by the Church, and will ever juſtly be condemned and anathematized by her Decrees, as forſaking the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Guide, and adhering to that fallible, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule of Scripture, according to their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix to Pope <hi>Pius</hi>'s <hi>Creed,</hi> printed in 1734.</note> But though theſe Attempts are not to be wondered at among Perſons who profeſs themſelves Papiſts; yet, that Proteſtants themſelves ſhould give a Handle to the Adverſaries of Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantiſm, to reproach their genuine Principles, and

            <p>The Uſe M. <hi>Boſſuet</hi> makes of his Hiſtory of the Variations of Religion in the Proteſtant Churches in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> is principally this, that the only true univerſal Catholic Church, under their univerſal infallible Head, <hi>has been always inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably the ſame,</hi> and conſequently a Separation from her heretical and dangerous; however, in the Courſe of this Hiſtory, it will appear that this wants Proof, and there can be no Impropriety in correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Hiſtorian, when we find him miſtaken or partial.

            <p>Many of the Hiſtorians of our own Nation have blended civil, military and eccleſiaſtical Affairs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; ſome have confined their Hiſtory to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> others to the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> ſome have treated only of particular Sects, others have dwelt on mere controverted Points, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in anſwer to their Opponents, with more of uncharitable Warmth than Argument.

            <p>Religion is generally conſidered as natural or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and theſe are differently defined, and as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently eſtimated as to their importance.
<note>Natural Religion defined.</note> Natural religion, Mr. Wollaſton tells us, conſiſts in "the purſuit of happineſs, by the practice of reaſon and truth
<note n="†" place="bottom">Wollaſton's Religion of Nature delineated, p. 52.</note>. Mr. Chambers defines it to be, "whatever we diſcover to be due and meet by the mere dictates of natural reaſon
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Chambers's Dictionary, Art. Religion.</note>." This is ſometimes called ethics or moral virtue, and includes in it theſe duties which, on the principles of reaſon, a man owes to God, to ſociety, and to himſelf; the duties we owe to the Deity reſulting from our rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, as our Creator, benefactor, lawgiver, and judge, and as the original fountain of all goodneſs, wiſdom, beauty and happineſs are veneration, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:0010800101:26"/>love, reſignation, dependence, obedience, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and praiſe, which, according to the meaſure of our finite capacities, ought to maintain ſome proportion to the grandeur of the object whom we love, and the greatneſs of our obligation. The duties we owe to ſociety of peculiar obligation, are filial or conjugal; but in general we owe to others, love, juſtice, ſincerity, fidelity, charity, the love of our country, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal benevolence. The duties reſpecting ourſelves are prudence, fortitude, the government of the appetites and paſſions, humility and reſignation; theſe conſtitute the temper of happineſs, and are the elements of our perfection and felicity

            <p>Another judicious author ſays, by natural religion we are to underſtand all thoſe things, which intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent beings, by the right exerciſe of their reaſonable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, can diſcover to be their duty, without a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural revelation to direct them, and upon that diſcovery ſo made, or capable of being made, which they are obliged to purſue, and practiſe in their ſeveral circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, offices or relations in life. Thus to love and reverence the Deity, to do juſtice between man and man, between our neighbours and ourſelves, and to be charitable and benevolent to all proper objects, are all of them branches of natural religion; which every man's reaſon may diſcover to him, and which the preſent conſtitution of things requires from him, and neceſſarily ſubjects him to

            <p>The law of nature, ſays another ingenious gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is the will of God, relating to human actions, grounded in the moral differences of things, and becauſe diſcoverable by the light of nature, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory upon all mankind. It is called the law of nature, 1. Becauſe of the manner of its promulgation,
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:0010800101:27"/>which is by natural reaſon; 2. Becauſe of its ſource of foundation, this law reſulting from the reſpective na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Beings, and things: of Beings, as God and man, and of things or actions, as morally good or evil, and having different phyſical effects; 3. Becauſe it is the law of God. Nature is but a <hi>fictiticus</hi>

The law or religion of nature is ſo called, ſays the judicious Dr. Conybeare
<note n="†" place="bottom">Defence of revealed Religion, p. 11, &amp;c.</note>, either becauſe it is founded in the reaſon and nature of things, or elſe becauſe it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to us, in the uſe and exerciſe of thoſe faculties which we enjoy. The religion of nature, as it is conſidered in theſe different views, will import quite different things; in the former it ſignifies a perfect collection of all thoſe moral doctrines and precepts which have a foundation in the nature and reaſon of things; but in the latter it is ſuch a collection as may be diſcovered by us, in the exerciſe of our proper faculties, according to the means and opportunities we enjoy.</p>
            <p>Dr. Clarke has been very clear and explicit in the diſcuſſion of this point; he ſays there is a neceſſary and immutable difference of things, that conſtitute an action morally fit or unfit; that ſome actions are in themſelves fit and reaſonable, and incumbent on men to do, even ſeparate from the conſideration of thoſe rules; being the poſitive will or command of God, and abſtracted from any views of private and perſonal advantage here, or reward hereafter; and <hi>vice verſa</hi>

<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:0010800101:28"/>to any command, or in reſpect to the reward; yet that it is certain and neceſſary that moral good and moral evil will be attended with reward or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe the ſame reaſons which prove God himſelf to be neceſſarily juſt and good, and the rules of juſtice, equity and goodneſs, to be his unalterable will, law, and command, to all rational beings, prove alſo that he cannot but be pleaſed with and approve ſuch creatures as imitate and obey him, by obſerving theſe rules, and be diſpleaſed with ſuch as act contrary thereto; and conſequently that he cannot, but ſome way or other, make a ſuitable difference in his dealings with them, and manifeſt his ſupreme power and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute authority, in finally ſupporting, maintaining and vindicating, effectually the honour of the divine laws, as becomes the righteous governor and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of all things; and as this does not appear viſible in the adminiſtration of providence in this world, it follows, that there will be a ſtate after this, wherein there will be an impartial retribution. That this is ſo apparently founded on truth, that there have been almoſt in every age, even among the Heathens, ſome wiſe and brave, and good men, who have by ſtudy and application made great diſcoveries in regard to theſe truths, and deduced ſuitable inferences from them

<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Samuel Chandler on the neceſſary and immutable Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between moral Good and Evil.

               </gap> piety to God, gratitude for benefits received, juſtice and charity, temperance and chaſtity, and the like virtues, are as eſſentially diſtinct from, and do convey as oppoſite and diſtinct ideas to impiety, ingratitude, injuſtice, uncharitableneſs, intemperance, luſt and the like vices; that it is abſolutely poſſible they can form the ſame ideas, or raiſe the ſame ſentiments or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in our breaſt; and though men may diſregard theſe intrinſic and neceſſary differences in their practice, thro' the warmth of paſſion, or the powerful influence of corrupt habits; yet they can never deſtroy that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, nor make the ideas of them to coincide, and become indiviſibly the ſame. P. 295, he adds, This difference between moral good and evil, and the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and unfitneſſes which they neceſſarily infer, is as eaſily and certainly to be diſcerned by mankind, as the difference between any natural or ſenſible objects whatſoever; and as virtue is, in the conſideration and idea of it, much more lovely and commendable than vice, ſo the natural conſequences with which they are almoſt conſtantly and inſeparably connected, plainly ſhew, which is moſt reaſonable and fit in itſelf, and inforce the indiſpenſible obligations of moral virtue
<note n="*" place="bottom">Chandler Ibid, p. 295.</note>. And page 307, But beſides this, ſurely there is a God that governs the world, who is not wholly inattentive to, and regardleſs of the moral ſtate and character of his creatures; a God who, from the purity and rectitude of his nature, will ever look with the higheſt compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency on thoſe who reſemble him in his moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; whilſt thoſe, whoſe actions ſhew them to be degenerated from the principles and rules of moral virtue, will be the objects of his diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>Theſe apprehenſions of moral virtue appear to be interwoven with the nature of man, and the importance of morality to the human life, and to its main and principal ends, ſhews wiſdom and deſign in giving men
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:0010800101:30"/>the ſenſe and knowledge of it ſo univerſally. When a ſpecies of intelligent beings are ſent into the world with ſentiments of morality, which are ſo evidently condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to their happineſs, filling with a variety of rational pleaſure, eminently uſeful to each other, and advancing their perfection and felicity in proportion to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of moral virtues, it ſufficiently demonſtrates they were not originally invented by politicians, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon credulous mankind as the dictates of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is hence evident, that morality is a part of the human conſtitution, and owes its ſource to its author: not that we are neceſſarily virtuous, as we are ſenſible or intelligent; for the very notion of it imports free-agency or choice; but the true meaning is, that the mind of man is ſo framed, as, when it attains the full exerciſe of its rational powers, to be neceſſarily ſenſible of moral obligations, and cannot willfully and preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditately act a contrary part, without doing violence to itſelf, which is all the neceſſity which is conſiſtent with the nature of ſuch a Being, and the nature of morality

            <p>One important uſe which Dr. Chandler
<note n="†" place="bottom">Chandler's Immutable Difference Syſtem, p. 286.</note>, and many other judicious authors, draws from theſe premiſſes is, that this difference of things, ariſing out of their very natures, leads us to form juſt conceptions of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and attributes of God. For inſtance, when we ſay, that God doth neceſſarily exiſt, doth not this ſuppoſe a natural and fixed difference between neceſſary and precarious exiſtence? In like manner, when we ſay, that God is eternal, immenſe, intelligent, all-powerful, and the like; we mean, that God is not a temporary, limited, inconſcious, impotent Being; and of conſequence do ſuppoſe, that the diſtinctions are not arbitrary, but as neceſſary and eternal as the Being of God himſelf. In like manner, with reſpect to God's
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:0010800101:31"/>moral perfections, when we ſay, that God is wiſe, and juſt, and good, and eternally and unalterably ſo; we mean, at leaſt, that God is not a fooliſh, unrighteous, evil, and cruel Being; and therefore muſt ſuppoſe that the difference between wiſdom and folly, juſtice and injuſtice, evil and good, cruelty and mercy, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely eternal and unalterable as God himſelf, of whom we affirm the one and deny the other; and therefore is not owing to his willing that it ſhould be ſo, nor alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at his pleaſure, nor dependent on him for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance; for if the diſtinction between theſe moral entities or objects was merely arbitrary, and originally the reſult only of the will of God, it can never be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of him that he is eternally and immutably the one and not the other. For upon this ſuppoſition he was not true, or juſt, or good, till he willed to be ſo, and might have been weak, unjuſt, and evil, by a like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of his will; if there be no eſſential immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table difference in the things themſelves. Nor can there be any poſſible certainty of God's continuing for the future to be wiſe, and juſt, and good, and not the contrary; for if there be no other difference between the one and the other, but what the will of God hath conſtituted; that will ceaſing, or altering theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions, in conſequence muſt ceaſe or alter, and God may be evil inſtead of good, or rather good and evil at the ſame time; which is an evident abſurdity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
            <p>On theſe accounts, ſays our author, I apprehend it plainly appears, that the very notion of God implies the neceſſary, eſſential, immutable, and independent difference between moral good and evil; and, indeed, without this ſuppoſition, we could have no ſure and fixed rule of action to ourſelves as reaſonable creatures; for if piety, juſtice, charity, and the like virtues, are the creatures of mere power, and the precarious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of abſolute will and pleaſure, power and will may immediately alter them, cancel men's obligations to
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:0010800101:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>regard them; and ſubſtitute in the room of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, injuſtice and cruelty, as the great obligations and duties of human nature

            <p>Again, moral good and evil are a kind of relative terms, that is, they do ſuppoſe, either in idea or actual exiſtence, certain reaſonable beings, and certain rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in which they ſtand to each other. Before ever the creation was formed, God was in and of himſelf poſſeſſed of infinite perfection, of all that power and wiſdom, which could not but exert themſelves in all acts of juſtice and goodneſs to his creatures. After their being brought in actual exiſtence, the original fitneſs of which conduct towards them was clearly diſcerned by God; whilſt they were yet only preſent in idea to his mind, and aroſe from thoſe apprehended relations which were actually in time to ſubſiſt between God and them. And as God had nothing to determine him in the formation of the world, but the direction of his own infinite underſtanding and wiſdom, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly at liberty to form what ſyſtems of beings he thought proper.</p>
            <p>When, indeed, God had actually given being to reaſonable creatures of ſuch particular capacities and circumſtances, their relations to each other; then, the fitneſs and obligations of thoſe duties reſulting from them, became certain and neceſſary, and were no longer dependent on the will of God, whether they ſhould carry in them any reaſonable obligation or not; and when they became the matter of an immediate divine command, they were not therefore reaſonable only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe commanded, but commanded becauſe naturally and antecedently reaſonable. And the reaſon of this is evident, becauſe the fitneſs and unfitneſs of moral good and evil, are as neceſſary and certain, as the natural and original difference between them. This, therefore, muſt be
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:0010800101:33"/>the ſupreme, immutable and univerſal rule of action to all reaſonable beings whatſoever. It is the one certain and unerring rule of the Divine conduct, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the moſt certain, the moſt amiable, and worthy rule of action to every reaſonable creature
<note n="*" place="bottom">See this more largely treated of in Doctor Chandler's Diſcourſe, before cited.</note>.</p>
            <p>And the evident tendency of virtue, ſays another ingenious author, is not only the private happineſs of ſingle perſons, but the good of the whole human kind; an univerſal benevolence links us together, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts every one of us in the affairs of another, ſo far as to deſire and endeavour their ſafety and happineſs, not inconſiſtently with our own. There are other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular determinations of the virtuous kind, ſuch as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, natural affection, gratitude, and the love of our country, ſo confeſſedly natural to men, as by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent to obtain the name of humanity; but ſo prevalent in ſome as to put them upon the moſt ſelf-denying and hazardous enterprizes for the good of others, and take the higheſt pleaſure when they ſee the effect of them promote a general good

            <p>When we conſider the conſtitution of human nature, with all its powers, affections, and principles of action, as the work of God; then that ſenſe of right and wrong of moral good and evil, which is the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of mankind from all the inferior orders, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to demand particular notice; as being not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in itſelf conſidered, the higheſt and moſt important faculty of the mind, but as what is given us for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting our conduct, and as what principally pointeth out to man his chief end, and that which is his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme good. That the ſenſe of right and wrong muſt have been intended by the Author of our beings as a law or rule for directing our conduct, is evident; for it is impoſſible to ſeparate a ſenſe of right and a ſenſe of
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:0010800101:34"/>obligation. <hi>A thing is right, therefore it is to be done; a thing is wrong, therefore it is not to be done;</hi> is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal law or language of nature, with which every man is acquainted; and while the ſenſe of right and wrong remaineth, the heart inſtantly and neceſſarily approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what appeareth to be right, and condemneth what it judgeth to be wrong

            <p>But it is an inquiry of the utmoſt moment to virtue and to human happineſs, how the Creator is diſpoſed and affected towards his creatures, as they obſerve it, or deviate from it in their actions. It may be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this appeareth plainly to have been the ſenſe of ſome perſons, that though the univerſe, and all the creatures in it, are the work of an original intelligent cauſe, perfectly wiſe, powerful, and beneficent; and the whole creation is governed by the ſole ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing providence of this being, and particularly, that all the inſtincts and affections planted in the heart of man, are his workmanſhip; yet he doth not attend at all to the temper or behaviour of men, as being according to the moral quality of them, the objects of his approbation or diſpleaſure: that, though he hath given to his creatures, the ſenſe of good and evil, of right and wrong, as a means of ſerving thoſe purpoſes by them which he had in view; yet he himſelf hath not that regard to right and wrong, which we find in our own minds, nor any thing analogous; and therefore he is not diſpleaſed with the tranſgreſſion of this law of our nature, nor hath any pleaſure or complacency in our obedience, and that we are never to expect any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of his, to give us tokens of his favour, for having purſued that which is right, or of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for having done what is wrong: that men are by the laws of nature thoroughly furniſhed for ſerving the purpoſes of this life; but that this is all that is
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:0010800101:35"/>to be expected, and that by eſtabliſhing and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this conſtitution of things, the Creator hath made proviſion for preſerving the world in that ſtate which will anſwer his original deſign.</p>
            <p>Very widely different from this way of thinking is the ſenſe of thoſe who conſider the ſupreme Being as a lawgiver, and a moral governor, in the proper ſenſe of the word; believing, that as he hath, in the ſenſe of right and wrong, written a law upon the heart of every man, and hath planted in every man a conſcience to approve or diſapprove of his actions, as they are good or evil; ſo he is himſelf attentive to the conduct of every individual, is pleaſed with the conformity of his temper and actions to the law that he hath given him, and diſpleaſed with the tranſgreſſors of it, and will interpoſe to teſtify his pleaſure or diſpleaſure by ſuch rewards and puniſhments as perfect wiſdom ſhall ſee fit and neceſſary to anſwer the end of a moral ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; that though God doth not interpoſe in the preſent ſtate of things by any acts of his, ſo as fully to anſwer what reaſon ultimately expecteth from a perfect moral ruler, in rewarding the good, and puniſhing the bad; yet another ſtate of things is to be expected, in which the great deſign of his moral adminiſtration ſhall be perfected, and he, as judge of the world, will do right to every ſubject of his moral kingdom.</p>
            <p>I cannot better cloſe the preceding remarks on na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural religion, and thereby introduce the advantages of a revelation, than with the teſtimony of Dr. Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton, in relation to the religious and moral ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Cicero, the greateſt Heathen philoſopher, whoſe ideas were probably the moſt refined of any man unaſſiſted by revelation.</p>

<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:0010800101:36"/>with, the utmoſt effort that human nature could make towards attaining its proper end, and taken notice of ſome conſiderable deficiencies in it, he adds, "From this general view of Cicero's religion, one cannot help obſerving, that the moſt exalted ſtate of human reaſon is ſo far from ſuperſeding the uſe, that it demonſtrates the benefit of a more explicit reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; for though the natural law, in the perfection it was carried by Cicero, might ſerve as a ſufficient guide to the few, ſuch as himſelf, of enlarged minds, and happy diſpoſitions; yet it had been ſo long depraved and adulterated by the prevailing errors and vices of mankind, that it was not diſcoverable even to thoſe few, without great pains and ſtudy, and could not produce in them at laſt any thing more than a hope, never a full perſuaſion; whilſt the greateſt part of mankind, even of the virtuous and inquiſitive, lived <hi>without the knowledge of a God, or the expectation of a futurity,</hi> and the multitude in every country was left to the groſs idolatry of the popular worſhip."</p>
            <p>This gives us abundant reaſon to reflect on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we enjoy by the divine light of a revelation, without the pains of ſearching, or danger of miſtaking, whereby we have not only the hope but the aſſurance of happineſs, and are not only the believers, but the heirs of immortality.</p>
            <p>It muſt however be acknowledged, that chriſtianity preſuppoſes the truth of natural religion. Whatſoever ſubverts natural religion, does conſequently much more ſubvert chriſtianity, and whatſoever tends to confirm natural religion is proportionably of ſervice to the true intereſt of the Chriſtian

            <p>Doctor Clarke
<note n="†" place="bottom">Doctor Clarke on the Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion, p. 220 &amp; ſeq.</note> has likewiſe conſidered the ſeveral principal arguments in ſupport of the divine authority and excellency of the Chriſtian inſtitution, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars. 1. That the Chriſtian religion, conſidered in its primitive ſimplicity, and as taught in the ſcriptures, has all the marks and proofs of its being actually and truly a divine revelation. 2. That the practical duties it enjoins, are all ſuch as are moſt agreeable to our natural notions of God, and moſt perfective of the nature, and conducive to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and well-being of men. 3. That the motives by which the Chriſtian religion inforces the practice of the duties it enjoins, are ſuch as are moſt ſuitable to the wiſdom of God, and moſt anſwerable to the natural expectations of man. 4. That the peculiar manner with which the Chriſtian religion enjoins the duties, and urges the motives before-mentioned, are exactly conſonant to the dictates of ſound reaſon, or the unprejudiced light of nature, and moſt perfective of it. 5. That all the doctrines, which the true, ſimple and uncorrupted Chriſtian religion teaches, are, tho' indeed many of them not diſcoverable by the light of nature, yet, when diſcovered by revelation, moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to found unprejudiced reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:0010800101:42"/>The Doctor then applies his poſtulatums to the following particulars: That it cannot be thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to be believed that God ſhould make a revelation of his will to mankind; and that in ſuch a revelation, wherein God freely proclaims the remiſſion of ſin and the acceptableneſs of repentance, he ſhould nevertheleſs have appointed ſuch a ſacrifice or expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for ſin as might at the ſame time be a ſufficient teſtimony of his irreconcileable hatred againſt it. That a Mediator ſhould be appointed between God and man, through and by whom the prayers of ſinners may be offered up, ſo as to be acceptable in his ſight. That the greateſt difficulty ariſes indeed from the dignity of the perſon (the only begotten Son of God); but even this, upon due enquiry, will appear to have nothing in it contrary to the nature of God, or the condition of things. Or laſtly, that there is any juſt objection to be drawn from the Chriſtian revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not being in fact univerſal
<note n="*" place="bottom">See alſo Doctor Benſon's Reaſonableneſs of Chriſtianity, in anſwer to Chriſtianity not founded on Argument.</note>. From hence the Doctor endeavours to prove, that the hiſtory of the Life of Chriſt, contained in the New Teſtament, is a true revelation of matter of fact; that God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day, wherein he will judge the world by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, in order to reward every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works

That after the reſurrection and the general judgement, wherein every man ſhall be judged according to his works, they that have done well, ſhall go into everlaſting happineſs

<note n="§" place="bottom">Doctor Samuel Clarke's Sermons.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:0010800101:43"/>The Doctor recites two or three of the principal of the preceding propoſitions, farther to explain and illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate them, viz. that all the doctrines, which the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion teaches, that is not only thoſe plain ones, which it requires to be believed as fundamental to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but even all the doctrines it teaches, as a matter of truth, are agreeable to ſound and unprejudiced reaſon
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Locke on the reaſonableneſs of Chriſtianity.</note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that every one of theſe doctrines has a natural tendency, and a direct and powerful influence, to reform mens lives, and to correct their manners. This, ſays he, is the great end and ultimate deſign of all true religion
<note n="†" place="bottom">N. B. Theſe points which are uſually conſidered as the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of the Chriſtian doctrine, as well as the arguments by which that inſtitution is ſupported, I have choſe to give from the writings of Doctor Clarke on theſe ſubjects, as I apprehend them beſt adapted to my preſent purpoſe, and agreeable to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our moſt eminent divines.</note>.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that all the doctrines of the Chriſtian faith do together make up an infinitely more conſiſtent and rational ſcheme of belief, than any that the wiſeſt of the ancient philoſophers ever did, or than the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningeſt of modern unbelivers can invent or contrive.</p>
            <p>Our author then proceeds to treat of miracles in general, of their nature and kinds, and how far the miracles wrought by Jeſus Chriſt may be brought in proof of his doctrines. His life and character is likewiſe conſidered as an accompliſhment of the prophecies concerning him. The teſtimony of our Saviour's diſciples he likewiſe introduces; which in all its circumſtances was the moſt credible, certain, and convincing, that they neither could be impoſed on themſelves, nor could have any deſign of impoſing upon others. That the apoſtles left their teſtimony af the works and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt in their writings; which writings have been tranſmitted down to us, by an uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, through all intermediate ages, without any conſiderable corruption or error, ſuch as might in any
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:0010800101:44"/>wiſe diminiſh our certainty of the truth of the whole. In ſum, there is no matter of fact in the world, atteſted in any hiſtory with ſo many circumſtances of credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, with ſo many collateral evidences, and in every reſpect attended with ſo many marks of truth, as this concerning the doctrine and the works of Chriſt

            <p>There are indeed many ingenious divines, both of the eſtabliſhed church, and other denomination of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who have wrote with great candour and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy on the holy ſcriptures, ſuggeſting many rational and uſeful hints for reconciling many ſeeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and obviating ſome of the moſt material objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of unbelievers; and this too, by ſuch juſt and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural interpretations of the moſt obſcure paſſages, by comparing the original text with the author's deſign, &amp;c. as have afforded much ſatisfaction

            <p>Were this property attended to, we ſhould find the important advantages of a revelation would be more univerſally anſwered in the promotion of truth, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and harmony, and charity even amongſt men of different ſentiments: and I ſincerely congratulate my countrymen, that, for the laſt fifty years, moſt of our reverend prelates have repreſented the great doctrines of religion in a rational and conſiſtent manner; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional decrees have been ſufficiently exploded, the important point of juſtification ſet in a true light, and the ſcriptures recommended as a ſufficient rule of faith and practice, abſtracted from an undue attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to eſtabliſhment and party; and that the will of God is the only rule immediately binding to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and ſubjoin this reaſon for the aſſertion, that he only can have authority over the conſcience to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to it, who is able to judge the conſcience, the prerogative of God alone.</p>

Mr. Prior's Reaſonableneſs of the Chriſtian Life, p. 56.</note>: "But is the Chriſtian religion only a republication of the law of nature, or merely a refined ſyſtem of morality; it is ſurely ſomething more; it is an act of grace, a ſtupendous plan of Providence, deſigned for the recovery of mankind from a ſtate of degradation and ruin, to the favour of God, and the hopes of an happy immortality through a mediator. Under this diſpenſation, true religion expreſſeth repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the perſon appointed by the ſupreme authority of heaven and earth, to reconcile apoſtate men to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Maker, as a ſacrifice for ſin, our vital head, and our governing Lord. This is religion as we are Chriſtians." And the peculiar excellency of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion lies in its bringing to light life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, when wrapped up almoſt in impenetrable darkneſs. This hath ſet the great truths of religion in a clear and ſtrong view, and hath propoſed new and powerful motives to influence our minds, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine our conduct: nothing is enjoined to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved but what is worthy of God; nothing to be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, but what is friendly to man.

            <p>With reſpect to poſitive inſtitutions, which ſome have as it were created as inſignificant, and others have laid too great ſtreſs on; biſhop Hoadley has given us a plain ſcriptural account of, viz. That when the great author of our holy religion publickly declared what were the doctrines upon which he would build his church and kingdom, he inſtituted two apt and ſignificant ordinances to be obſerved in his
<pb n="liii" facs="tcp:0010800101:52"/>church. One was baptiſm, that rite or ceremony by which the members thereof ſhould profeſs their faith in, and diſcipleſhip to Chriſt. The other injunction was, that his church and people ſhould ſtatedly, in communion and fellowſhip with each other, eat bread and drink wine in remembrance of the author and finiſher of their faith; and in this they were to continue, in order to ſhew forth and keep up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his life and death till he come

            <p>And when the ſcriptures are properly regarded as our rule, we ſhall find they exhibit to our minds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the principles of natural religion, only a few evangelical doctrines and precepts, which are wiſely adapted to improve our ſentiments of God, give us a juſt idea of his diſpenſation of grace and truth by Jeſus Chriſt, and tending to cultivate that rectitude of mind and life, which may in ſome meaſure fit us for the happineſs therein promiſed.</p>
            <p>And it is acknowledged by all proteſtant Chriſtians, that the ſcriptures, more eſpecially the writings of the New Teſtament, contain a plain perfect rule of faith and practice, in oppoſition to the neceſſity of a living infallible guide, and the authoritative impoſition of creeds and articles of faith. Hence that immemorable prelate before-mentioned aſſerts,
<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoadley's Nature of the Kingd, and Church of Chriſt, p. 30.</note> The church of Chriſt is the kingdom of Chriſt; he is King in his own kingdom; he is ſole lawgiver to his ſubjects, and ſole judge in matters relating to ſalvation; his laws and ſanctions are plainly fixed. Their faith was once delivered by him; the conditions of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was once laid down by him; the nature of God's worſhip was once declared by him; and it is eaſy to judge, whether of the two is moſt becoming a ſubject of the kingdom of Chriſt, that is, a member of his church, to ſeek all thoſe particulars in thoſe plain,
<pb n="liv" facs="tcp:0010800101:53"/>ſhort declarations of their King and lawgiver himſelf, or to hunt after them through the infinite contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the numberleſs perplexities, the endleſs diſputes of weak men in ſeveral ages, till the enquirer himſelf is loſt in the labyrinth, and perhaps ſits down in deſpair or infidelity. If Chriſt be our King, let us ſhew ourſelves ſubjects to him alone, in the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of conſcience and eternal ſalvation, and, without fear of man's judgment, live and act as becomes thoſe who wait for the appearance of an all-knowing and impartial judge, even that King whoſe kingdom is not of this world.</p>
            <p>Much to the ſame purpoſe, in oppoſition to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended authority and infallibility of the church of Rome, and her boaſted tradition, Dr. Chandler ſays, "we have no full and certain account of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles but from the records of the New Teſtament; and as theſe contain the whole revelation of the goſpel, all that we are to believe and practiſe as Chriſtians, it is an undeniable conſequence, that we can no otherwiſe demonſtrate our ſubjection and fidelity to Chriſt, as Lord and lawgiver in his church, than by our care in acquainting ourſelves with the ſacred records of truth, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly adhering to them, as the only rule and ſtandard of our faith and worſhip

            <p>I ſhall cloſe the whole with that remarkable para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of Chillingworth, which whoever hears or reads, as the language of one converted from Popery by the ſtudy of the ſcriptures, cannot help being greatly pleaſed with it. Addreſſing himſelf to a writer of the Romiſh church, he thus pleads the Proteſtant cauſe, "Know then, Sir, that when I ſay the religion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants is in truth to be preferred before yours; as on the one ſide, I do not underſtand by your religion the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Bellarmine or Baronius, or any other private man amongſt you; nor the doctrine of the Sorbonne or of the Jeſuits, or of the Dominicans, or of any other particular company or ſociety amongſt you; but that wherein you all agree or profeſs to agree, the doctrine of the council of Trent; ſo accordingly on the other ſide, by the religion of Proteſtants, I do not underſtand the doctrine of Luther or Calvin, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancton, nor the confeſſion of Augſburg or Geneva, nor the catechiſm of Heidelberg, nor the articles of the church of England; no, nor the harmony of Proteſtant creeds and confeſſions; but that wherein they all agree, and which they all ſubſcribe with one accord, as the undoubted perfect rule of their faith and actions, that is, the Bible. The Bible, I ſay the Bible only, is the religion of Proteſtants, whatſoever elſe they believe beſides it: and the plain, irrefragable, and indubitable conſequences of it, well may they hold as matters of opinion, but as matter of faith and religion, neither can they with coherence to their own grounds believe it
<pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:0010800101:55"/>themſelves, nor require the belief of it of others, without moſt high and ſchiſmatical preſumption. I, for my part, after a long, and (as I verily believe and hope) impartial ſearch of the true way to eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, do profeſs plainly that I cannot find any reſt for the ſole of my foot, but upon this rock only. I ſee plainly, and with mine own eyes, that there are Popes againſt Popes, councils againſt councils, ſome fathers againſt others, the ſame fathers againſt themſelves, a conſent of fathers of one age againſt a conſent of fathers of another age, the church of one age againſt the church of another age. Traditive interpretations of ſcripture are pretended; but there are few or none to be found. No tradition but only of ſcripture can derive itſelf from the fountain, but may be plainly proved to be brought in, in ſuch an age after Chriſt, or that ſuch an age it was not: in a word, there is no ſufficient certainty but of ſcripture only for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering man to build upon. This, therefore, and this only, I have reaſon to believe, this I will profeſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this I will live, and for this, if there be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, I will not only willingly, but even gladly, loſe my life; though I ſhould be ſorry that Chriſtians ſhould take it from me. Propoſe me any thing out of this book, and require whether I believe or no, and ſeem it never ſo incomprehenſible to human reaſon, I will ſubſcribe it with hand and heart, as knowing no demonſtration can be ſtronger than this, God hath ſaid ſo, therefore is it true. In other things, I will take no man's liberty of judging from him, neither ſhall any man take mine from me. I will think no man the worſe man, nor the worſe Chriſtian, I will love no man the leſs, for differing in opinion from me; and what meaſure I mete to others, I expect from them again. I am fully aſſured that God does not, and therefore men ought not to require any more of any man than this: To believe the ſcripture to be God's

            <p>I can ſee no reaſon, ſays a judicious author, for undervaluing revelation, in order to exalt reaſon, nor on the other hand to diſparage reaſon, ſince they jointly concur in furniſhing us with the moſt noble and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable principles of religion. What but revelation gave to Wollaſton ſo much the ſuperiority over Cicero in his delineation of the religion of nature, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with regard to the unity and moral perfections, and providence of the Deity, and the duties owing to him?</p>
            <p>All this will be readily acknowledged by Proteſtant Chriſtians of every denomination, while others perhaps do not eaſily perceive the reaſons upon which this principle of their faith is founded, and they raiſe a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of objections to the authenticity, perſpicuity, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs, and excellency of the Chriſtian revelation; the moſt conſiderable of which will be taken notice of in a following ſection. I ſhall, firſt, endeavour to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the proper import of the term <hi>Truth,</hi> its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Truth is a term uſed in a variety of ſenſes,
<note>Truth defined.</note> and applied to different ſciences and ſubjects. Logical truth is the conformity of things with the ideas themſelves
<note n="†" place="bottom">Martin.</note>. Moral truth is the conformity of words, geſtures, and actions, with the heart
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Mr. Chambers defines logical truth to be in direct oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to falſhood, and is applied to the propoſitions which anſwer, or accord to the reality of the thing, whereof ſomething is affirmed or denied
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chambers.</note>. And Mr. Wollaſton ſays, thoſe propoſitions are true, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs things as they are, or truth is the conformity of thoſe words or ſigns by which things are expreſſed to the things themſelves
<note n="§" place="bottom">Wollaſton.</note>. Truth, likewiſe, ſignifies veracity, or a conformity of words to thoughts, pure,
<pb n="lviii" facs="tcp:0010800101:57"/>or unadulterate; exactneſs or conformity to rule; reality, as oppoſed to fiction; honeſty, integrity, &amp;c.
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Johnſon.</note> It is uſed for the doctrines of the goſpel, Gal. iii. 1. as oppoſed to Jewiſh ceremonies, John, i. 17. and as the genuine or original, as oppoſed to ſpurious
<note n="*" place="bottom">Cruden.</note>. Theſe are ſome of the principal ſenſes in which it is uſed; but as the right uſe of reaſon, in the enquiry after truth, is what conſtitutes the ſcience of logic, variety of other definitions and diſtinctions relative to this ſubject may be ſeen in peculiar treatiſes on that ſubject.</p>
            <p>The different ſenſes in which I have conſidered truth, or to which this term is applied, convey to our minds an idea of its nature and importance, and that there is a real eſſential and abſolute utility and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the poſſeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>Indeed the purſuit and acquiſition of truth is of infinite concernment to mankind;
<note>Importance of Truth.</note> hereby we become acquainted with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, both in heaven and earth, and their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious relations to each other. It is by this means we diſcover our duty to God and our fellow-creatures; by this we arrive at the knowledge of natural religion, and learn to confirm our faith in divine revelation, as well as to underſtand what is revealed. Our wiſdom, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and piety, our preſent conduct, and our future hopes, are all influenced by the uſe of our rational powers in the ſearch after truth
<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Watts's Logic, p. 2.</note>.</p>
            <p>The love and deſire of truth is a principle implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the nature of man; it has generally an eaſy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to unbiaſſed minds, and will aſſume its empire and triumph over error, even in ſpite of popularity, intereſt, and undue influence from others; and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious truths have been often known to arm the mind with integrity, ſuperior to the ſevereſt perſecution. Hence Polybius, the Roman hiſtorian, obſerves, that
<pb n="lix" facs="tcp:0010800101:58"/>truth may be oppoſed, but it cannot be ſubdued
<note n="*" place="bottom">Polybius in Excerptis, lib. xii.</note>: and Cicero, to the ſame purpoſe, that truth always carries ſuch a force with her, that ſhe cannot be overcome, neither by the flattery of art, nor ingenuity of men; and though ſhe had no advocate or patron in her cauſe, yet ſhe would be able to defend herſelf
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cicero Orat. in Vatinium.</note>.</p>
            <p>But this is not univerſally acknowledged. There are men of a ſceptical turn of mind, who aſſert there is no poſſibility of diſtinguiſhing truth from falſehood: and therefore they have abandoned all pretences to knowledge, and maintain ſtrenuouſly that nothing is to be known.</p>
            <p>The firſt men of this humour made themſelves fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in Greece by the name of ſceptics, that is, ſeekers. They taught, that all things are uncertain, though they allowed that ſome were more probable than others. After theſe aroſe the ſect of the Pyrrhonics, from Pyrrho, their maſter, who would not allow one propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to be more probable than another. But of this ſect an ingenious author obſerves, that their own doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine gives their profeſſion the lie; becauſe they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined concerning every propoſition, that it was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and believed that as a certain truth, while they profeſſed there was nothing certain

            <p>The moſt important queſtion then on this ſubject is this, what is the criterion or diſtinguiſhed mark of truth? How ſhall we know when a propoſition is true or falſe? There are ſo many diſguiſes of truth in the world, ſo many falſe appearances of truth, that not only one man differs in his ſentiments from another, but one ſectary abſolutely deny what another eſteem undoubted and fundamental. Let us therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what is the general criterion of truth; and, in order to this, it is proper to conſider what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we aſſent to the truth of one propoſition, and
<pb n="lx" facs="tcp:0010800101:59"/>deny another; and this will be found to ariſe from a clear and diſtinct perception, or full evidence of the agreement or diſagreement of our ideas to one another, or to things; for ſince our minds are of ſuch a make, that when the evidence is exceeding plain and ſtrong, we cannot with-hold our aſſent, we ſhould then be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily expoſed to believe falſhood, if compleat evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould be found in any propoſitions that are not true. But ſurely the God of perfect wiſdom, truth and goodneſs, would never oblige his creatures to be thus deceived; and therefore he would never have conſtituted us of ſuch a frame as would have rendered it naturally impoſſible to guard againſt error
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Watts.</note>.</p>
            <p>There are two deſires interwoven in the frame of our beings, the deſire of truth, and the deſire of happineſs; in both which there is a kind of infinity, which ariſes after this manner. By the contemplation of my own ſoul, I gain the ideas of ſeveral perfections with which I perceive it to be adorned; following therefore the impulſe of my own mind, I enlarge the proſpect, and widen my ideas more and more, till loſt in the conception of a being, who poſſeſſes all theſe perfections, and very probably many more, with the additional characteriſtics of infinite and eternal: Now it is the nature of the underſtanding, and of the will, to purſue the ſupreme truth, and the ſupreme good; and conſequently while I have a being in view, in whoſe idea is lodged infinite truth and infinite good, which alone is able to anſwer that idea of ſomething like infinity that is in our deſires, I ſhall never reſt ſatisfied in any allotment among the creatures, though in the fineſt apartment in the univerſe, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with every good, ſhort of a correſpondence and intercourſe with the Deity

            <p>It is true there are ſome ſpeculative points which God hath placed beyond our reach; and there are
<pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:0010800101:60"/>others of an abſtruſe, ambiguous nature, in the various branches of ſcience, &amp;c. that require much previous learning, ſtrength of natural abilities, ſtudy and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, in the uſe of proper helps to underſtand and explain. Theſe can in no wiſe be the concern of all, and can only with any propriety be the ſubject of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry to a few, whoſe diſpoſitions and abilities, lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and profeſſion in life, may render it at all eligible; and after all, a diverſity of ſentiments will neceſſarily ariſe. Nor can we reaſonably expect the ſame degree of evidence in all caſes or ſubjects, that properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to make the ſubjects of our enquiry. There are many things in this dark and imperfect ſtate, wherein we muſt be content with probability, where our beſt light and reaſoning will reach no further; we muſt balance arguments as juſtly as we can; and when we cannot find weight enough on either ſide to determine the ſcale with ſovereign force and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, we muſt content ourſelves perhaps with a ſmall preponderation. This will give us a probable opinion; and theſe probabilities are ſufficient for the daily determination of a thouſand actions in human life, and many times even in matters of religion.— Suppoſe, for inſtance, I had been honeſtly and long ſearching what religion I ſhould chuſe, yet I could not find that the arguments in defence of chriſtianity aroſe to compleat certainty, but went only ſo far as to give me a probable evidence of the truth of it; though many difficulties ſtill remained, yet I ſhould think myſelf obliged to receive and practiſe that religion; for the God of nature and reaſon hath bound us to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and act according to the beſt evidence we have, even though it be not abſolute and compleat; and as he is our ſupreme Judge, his abounding goodneſs and equity will approve and acquit the man, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience honeſtly and willingly ſeeks the beſt light, and obeys it as far as he can diſcover it

               <pb n="lxii" facs="tcp:0010800101:61"/>Here it may be proper to ſurvey the ſeveral kinds of evidence, or the different ways whereby truth is let into the mind, and which produce accordingly ſeveral kinds of knowledge; and theſe we ſhall diſtribute into theſe ſix,
<note>Evidences of Truth.</note> 
               <hi>viz. ſenſe, conſciouſneſs, intelligence, reaſon, human</hi> and <hi>divine teſtimony.</hi> 1. The evidence of ſenſe, is when we form a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition according to the evidence of any of our ſenſes; it is upon this evidence that we know and believe the various occurrences in human life; and almoſt all the hiſtories of mankind, that are written by eye and ear-witneſſes, are built upon this principle.</p>
            <p>It is a principle of the Epicureans, that the ſenſes are not capable of being deceived; for beſides that the ſtructure of the organs, and the circumſtances of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects conſidered, they ought not to repreſent things otherwiſe than they do. The ſenſes are purely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; they receive impreſſions from ſurrounding bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but pronounce nothing concerning them; that is the buſineſs of the mind, which delivers its opinion upon the divers appearances of ſenſe, and too often not more haſtily than wrong. When therefore we talk of the errors of the ſenſes, the meaning is, that things are many times in themſelves quite different from what they appear to the ſenſes; and that they who take their meaſures of judging from the ſenſes, will unavoidably be led into a thouſand miſtakes.</p>
            <p>The reaſons why people truſt ſo much to ſenſe, I believe, are principally theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">I. If ſenſe may err, why not reaſon? If one power and faculty may be deceived, why not all others? At which rate we ſhall have no criterion of truth, nor be in poſſeſſion of certainty; but univerſal ſcepticiſm muſt bear down all before it. I anſwer, that becauſe ſenſe may be impoſed upon, it follows not that reaſon may; in caſe ſenſe miſleads us, reaſon may ſet us right again. So that here God hath provided a higher faculty to correct the errors oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:0010800101:62"/>by the faculties below it; and perhaps the fallaciouſneſs of our ſenſes was deſigned for this very end, that we might make the more frequent uſe of our reaſon. But ſhould reaſon be deceived, there is no faculty above this to inform it better; and are not the wiſdom and goodneſs of God our ſecurity, that he would not frame us with ſuch a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, as ſhould naturally lead us into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror? Beſides this, we are to conſider, that the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of ſenſe (when it does miſtake) are not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; it has little to do with religion, upon which depends our moſt important intereſt. But reaſon rightly underſtood, and rightly managed, is to be the meaſure of our conduct; and conſequently if free from prejudices, we may be aſſured that ſhall never err in matters of moment and conſequence.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If ſenſe may be deceived in one or more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, why not in all? and if in all, we can be certain of nothing. I anſwer, this way of arguing is entirely inconcluſive, becauſe the wiſe Governor has furniſhed us with reaſon to find out our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; and this, by comparing things together, it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily does. Upon the whole, we may conclude with this obſervation, that our ſenſes were not given us to inform us ſo much what things are in themſelves, as of the relation they bear to each other, and to our bodies
<note n="*" place="bottom">Grove, v. p. 409.</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">III. As we learn what belongs to the body by the evidence of ſenſe; ſo we learn what belongs to the ſoul by an inward conſciouſneſs, which may be called a ſort of internal feeling, or ſpiritual ſenſation of what paſſes in the mind: Thus it appears that we obtain the knowledge of a multitude of propoſitions, as well as ſingle ideas, by theſe two principles, which Mr. Locke calls ſenſation and reflection. One of them is a ſort of conſciouſneſs of what affects the body, and the other
<pb n="lxiv" facs="tcp:0010800101:63"/>is a conſciouſneſs of what paſſes in the mind
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Watts's Logic, p. 178.</note>. Some philoſophers define it an inner ſentiment of a thing, whereof one may have a clear and diſtinct notion: in this ſenſe they ſay, that we do not know our own ſoul, nor are we aſſured of the exiſtence of our own thoughts, otherwiſe than by conſciouſneſs
<note n="†" place="bottom">Chambers.</note>.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Intelligence relates chiefly to thoſe abſtract propoſitions, which carry their own evidence with them, and admit no doubt about them. Our percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſelf-evidence in any propoſition, is called intelligence; it is our knowledge of thoſe firſt principles of truth, which are as it were wrought into the very nature and make of our mind. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly an intelligent being, muſt have ſome immediate object of his underſtanding, or at leaſt a capacity of having ſuch: an intelligent being, among the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate objects of his mind, muſt have ſome that are abſtract and general; thoſe ideas or objects that are immediate, will be adequately and truly known to that mind, whoſe ideas they are: theſe propoſitions are called axioms or maxims, or firſt principles; theſe are the very foundation of all improved knowledge and reaſonings; and ſuch an immediate view of things in their own nature, is ſometimes called <hi>intuition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. Reaſoning is the next ſort of evidence, and that is, when one truth is inferred or drawn from others, by natural and juſt methods of argument; as, when I ſurvey the heavens and earth, this gives evidence to my reaſon, that there is a God who made them
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dr. Watts's.</note>. Thus, by the help of truths already known, more may be diſcovered; for thoſe inferences which ariſe preſently from the application of general truths, to the particular things and caſes contained under them, muſt be juſt, and will hold good, not only in reſpect of axioms and firſt truths, but alſo and equally of theorems and other general truths. When they are
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:0010800101:64"/>more known, theſe may be capable of the like appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and the truth of ſuch conſequences as are made by virtue of them, will always be as evident as that of the theorems themſelves
<note n="*" place="bottom">Wollaſton's Religion of Nature, p. 43. 4to Edit.</note>: in other words, every juſt conſequence is founded on ſome known truth; by virtue of which, one thing follows from another, and if the premiſſes are true, and the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are juſt, they will be ſo too. That power which any intelligent being has of ſurveying his own ideas, and comparing them; of forming to himſelf out of thoſe that are immediate and abſtract, ſuch general and fundamental truths as he can be ſure of, and of making ſuch inferences and concluſions as are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, or to any other truth after it comes to be known, in order to find out more truth, prove or diſprove ſome aſſertion, reſolve ſome queſtion, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what is fit to be done upon occaſion, &amp;c. the caſe or thing under conſideration, being firſt fairly ſtated and prepared, is what I mean by the faculty of reaſon, or what intitles him to the epithet <hi>rational;</hi> or, in ſhort, reaſon is the faculty for making ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and concluſions, as are mentioned under the preceding propoſition
<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 45. Some uſeful obſervations in the ſeq.</note>.</p>
            <p>"The propoſitions, which I believe upon this kind of evidence, are called concluſions or rational truths, and the knowledge we gain this way is properly ſcience."</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe remarked by the aforecited judicious author, in treating of the nature and foundations of probability, that the force of it reſults from <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>obſervation</hi> together
<note n="‡" place="bottom">This is objected to by other authors, as thoſe obſervations ariſe from the forementioned ſprings of knowledge.</note>. As the one is not ſufficient without the other, reaſon without <hi>obſervation</hi> wants matter to work upon, and obſervations are neither to be made juſtly by ourſelves, nor to be rightly choſen out of thoſe made by others; nor to be aptly applied,
<pb n="lxvi" facs="tcp:0010800101:65"/>without the aſſiſtance of <hi>reaſon;</hi> both together may ſupport opinion and practice in the abſence of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and certainty; for thoſe obſervations upon the nature of men and things, which we have made our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we know; and our own reaſoning concerning them, and deductions from them, we know; and from hence there cannot but ariſe in many caſes an internal obligation to give our aſſent to this, rather than that, or to act one way rather than another: and as to the obſervations of others, they may be ſo cautiouſly and ſkillfully taken under our notice, as to become almoſt our own, ſince our own reaſon and experience may direct us in the choice and uſe of them.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Another kind of evidence, is the teſtimony of others, and this is a large part of our knowledge. Ten thouſand things there are which we believe, merely upon the authority or credit of thoſe who have ſpoken or written of them; it is by this that moſt of the tranſactions of human life are managed, we know the characters and laws of our preſent governors, as well as things that are at a vaſt diſtance from us, in foreign nations, or in ancient ages: according as the perſons who inform us of any thing, are many, or few, or more or leſs wiſe, and faithful, and credible, ſo our faith is more or leſs firm or wavering, and the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition believed either certain or doubtful; but in matters of faith an exceeding great probability is called a moral certainty
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. Watts's Logic, and Ditton on the Reſurrection.</note>. Hiſtories written by faithful and credible authors, and read with judgment, may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us with examples, parallel caſes, and general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, for forming our manners and principles too; and by the frequent peruſal of them, and meditation upon them, a judicious judgment is formed of many dubious caſes, and of matters of great importance.</p>
            <p>To conclude, that we ought to follow probability in this caſe, as well as the forementioned, is evident; becauſe where there is no greater certainty to be had,
<pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:0010800101:66"/>it becomes our only light and guide; and it muſt be reaſonable to direct our ſteps by probability, when we have nothing clearer to walk by; and, if it be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we are obliged to do it. When there is nothing in the oppoſite ſcale, or nothing of equal weight, this in the courſe of nature muſt turn the beam
<note n="*" place="bottom">Wollaſton's Religion of Nature, p. 59.</note>.</p>
            <p>With regard to divine teſtimony, though it comes under the denomination of the evidence of teſtimony, is of a ſuperior nature; and the aſſent to a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition upon this evidence is ſtiled <hi>divine faith,</hi> and ſo far as we underſtand the meaning of this word it produces a ſupernatural certainty, or an abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſurance.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Inſpiration is a ſort of evidence diſtinct from all the former, and that is when ſuch an overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impreſſion of any propoſition is made upon the mind by God himſelf, that gives a convincing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable evidence of the truth and divinity of it. But as this is of the higheſt kind of evidence, chiefly, if not ſolely, confined to the prophets, and ſome of the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt apoſtles and firſt propagators of chriſtianity, it is not ſo applicable to our preſent purpoſe, to the nature of thoſe truths it concerns us to know in the ſtate and circumſtances in which Divine Providence hath placed us. This kind of evidence has been ſo often pretended to, either as working on the outward ſenſes, or by impreſſions on the imagination, ſpiritual feelings, ſudden and powerful impulſes on the mind, whereby ſome perſons have fancied a ſuperior or divine light and power attending them, which they could neither explain or prove to the ſatisfaction of rational and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious perſons, that ſuch pretenſions have been often, and, I think, very juſtly exploded, as the effect of weakneſs and enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>The various kinds of evidence upon which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any propoſition, afford us the following remarks.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="lxviii" facs="tcp:0010800101:67"/>I. That there are ſome propoſitions that admit of different kinds of evidence, and of which we have an unqueſtionable certainty, and conſequently may be conſidered as fundamental truths, to direct our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries and conduct.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That, though ſome of theſe evidences are ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to others in their nature, and give a greater ground of certainty in ſome points, more immediately thoſe which are the ſubject of divine revelation; yet that reaſon in its own nature will always lead us into truth in matters within its compaſs, if it were uſed aright, or it would require us to ſuſpend our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where there is want of evidence; and it muſt, at the ſame time, and with equal certainty, be admitted, as the proper means to judge of the reality and degrees of other kinds of evidence, upon which any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may preſent itſelf to our minds, and claim our aſſent
<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Nature of Moral Evidence, illuſtrated in fifteen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in Dicton's Diſcourſe of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, from p. 123 to 164.</note>. But it will alſo follow, that if the judgment be corrupted, and the underſtanding darkened, with reſpect to religious principles and moral truths, which concern the rectitude and juſt conduct and true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of intelligent and free beings, he is then under as great an incapacity of reaſoning, and incapable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the proper difference of actions and characters, as if he had been formed with a natural incapacity of reaſoning.</p>
            <p>Religion is wholly founded in reaſon, and directed by it; and therefore, when this light, this ſacred and divine light, is not attended to; when imagination, paſſion, and prejudices and falſe conceptions, uſurp the place, and are allowed all that authority and influence, which only belong to truth, and the dictates of a ſober well informed judgment, it muſt unavoidably follow, that the truths of religion will be obſcured by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="lxix" facs="tcp:0010800101:68"/>and prejudices, and its native beauty ſullied by extravagance and enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>But as this is a ſubject of the utmoſt importance, I ſhall here take occaſion to inquire into the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and general cauſes, by which the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is obſcured, and the judgment perverted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved; cauſes that have been the moſt prevailing in all ages, and which, as long as they are allowed to ſubſiſt, will in all future time have the ſame fatal effect.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt of theſe that preſents itſelf to a moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial obſerver, is indolence and inattention: every one muſt acknowledge, that it is not the mere faculty of reaſon that illuminates the mind; but the proper exerciſe and careful improvement of it, by frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection and impartial inquiry: for a man of the moſt ſtrong and extenſive natural abilities, who never thinks nor never examines, cannot be expected to make half the proficiency in divine knowledge as a more delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ingenious inquirer of a much inferior under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; nay his judgment may be as weak and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, for want of proper care to inform it aright, and, thro' a ſhameful negligence, his reaſon may be as groſly fallacious, and his principles as repugnant to common ſenſe, as thoſe that find admittance where human reaſon is in a lower and imperfect ſtate; ſo that indolence, and, which are the neceſſary conſequences of it, lazineſs and ſuperficial examination, are the certain foundation of error and intellectual darkneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Another common cauſe of ignorance and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in our inquiries, is prejudice, which throws a miſt before the underſtanding, and hinders it from diſcerning clearly the evidences, and beauties, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of truth. It gives the judgment a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and ſtrong bias towards one ſet of principles, which of conſequence are readily admitted as the beſt and moſt rational; and the contrary truths, though of the moſt momentous kind, are as naturally diſcredited and vilified. The arguments by which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
<pb n="lxx" facs="tcp:0010800101:69"/>are diminiſhed, and conſidered as mere trifles; but the objections againſt them magnified, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive and unanſwerable. Thus will prejudice, though of the moſt groſs and malignant kind, engroſs all the fairneſs, candour, and ſkill in argument to itſelf, and paint on the ſide of truth and reaſon nothing but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial knowledge, or narrowneſs of mind. The prejudices by which mankind are influenced, are various, but have all the ſame infatuating and blinding quality; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be prejudice ariſing from education or intereſt, or the prejudice of implicit veneration for great names, whom we have been taught to call Rabbi, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſerved ſubmiſſion to human authority; which ſoever of theſe bears the principal ſway, it has always tended to the ſame point, and the effect of it has been this, making men conceited in ignorance, and obſtinate in error.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Senſuality is a never-faling means of a darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perverting the judgment; for, by inflaming the paſſions, it indiſpoſes the mind for the calm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and purſuit of truth in general. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the very faculty of reaſon, and renders it unfit for ſublime exerciſes. It introduces a falſe taſte, and deſtroys the reliſh of mental pleaſures; for ſenſe and reaſon are ſuch contrary principles, that if the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the firſt be our ſurpreme and moſt favourite entertainment, we ſhall regard the latter ſo much the leſs in proportion, and perhaps contract an utter averſion to its employments and exerciſes. But in an uncommon degree does ſenſuality unfit for an impartial ſtudy of religious and moral truth, after which it begets a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of which it muſt needs entertain ſome kind of horror, as of a reprover, a condemner, an awakener of guilty ſuſpicions, and a ſcourge of unlawful exceſſes. To what a ſad condition muſt that man be reduced, whoſe diſpoſition and conduct in a manner force him to dread and fly from thinking, that he may be the more quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſerenely miſerable?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="lxxi" facs="tcp:0010800101:70"/>IV. Next to ſenſuality, the moſt univerſal corrupter of good principles, and extinguiſher of reaſon's light, is ſuperſtition. It alarms with panic terrors, and makes a man afraid of free inquiry, as if honeſty, and ingenuity of mind, which are the very eſſence and genuine ſpirit of an acceptable virtue and piety, were crimes that deſerved damnation; and an abject ſlaviſh credulity, which is a reproach to the character of a man, was however the chief excellence and duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the ſureſt recommendation to the eſteem and favour of the Diety. Superſtition always proceeds from weakneſs of mind; it ſuppoſes the underſtanding to be diſturbed, and fancy or fear, or preſumption, to have the aſcendant; and as theſe prevail farther, the judgment will be more and more debaſed, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual darkneſs proportionably increaſed; and when once a man hath brought himſelf to believe in earneſt that the great God of the univerſe is a weak, capricious Being, pleaſed and offended with trifles; that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring human reaſon, by ſubſtituting forms, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily geſtures, or penances, in the room of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evil habits and inward rectitude, and practiſing ceremonies of devotion, equally abſurd and uſeleſs, is the way in which he chuſes to be ſerved and worſhipped; when once a man has brought himſelf really to believe theſe are great and important points, in which reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion conſiſts, he ſeems to have loſt the common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of reaſon. And it is no wonder to find that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, which abounds in infinite inſtances in a like kind, is loſt in confuſion, and goes on from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of folly and extravagance to another, till, in the end, it quite obliterates all rational ſenſe of God, and of his worſhip, and the very natural conſcience of good and evil. Falſe notions of God, the baſis and ſupport of ſuperſtition, are fundamental errors, which deſtroy the ground-work of all true judgment about virtue and piety, and on which no ſuperſtructure can be raiſed ſuited to the foundation, that has any thing in it but
<pb n="lxxii" facs="tcp:0010800101:71"/>weakneſs and falſhood; and therefore, while ſuch errors are unhappily entertained, it is ſcarce poſſible in nature that any other conſequence ſhould follow than this, that, with reſpect to religion, the grand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of human life, the light that is in us will be total darkneſs
<note n="†" place="bottom">Abſtract from Dr. Foſter of Revealed Religion, vol. I.</note>.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the principal cauſes of that ignorance and error that have ſo much prevailed in the world; but there are a variety of others, which are either preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of inquiry, or impediments that obſtruct the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of truth; which though I would not be tedious in expatiating upon, yet the mention of ſome of them may have its uſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the want of forming in our minds ſome proper principles and rules of judging concerning truths in general or particular. Want of due reflection upon thoſe ideas we have, or may have, and uſing words and phraſes that have no fixed determinate ideas, and conſequently muſt be deſtitute of that knowledge which might otherwiſe be gained from the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them and their relations. Attempting to judge of things quite above our reach, whereby our ideas are confuſed, and aſſert or deny without being at all able to demonſtrate the truth or falſity of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Not underſtanding wherein the force of an argument or juſt conſequence conſiſts, from whence it comes to paſs that perſons aſſert ſuch a thing to follow from ſuch a poſition, when it is no axiom, no theorem, no truth, that we know of. Defect of memory and imagination, which is often ſhallow, treacherous, confuſed, and cannot be depended upon. Attending too much to ſenſe; for as neceſſary as our ſenſes are to us, there are certainly many things which fall not within their notice; many which cannot be exhibited after the manner of ſenſible objects, and to which no images belong. Want of retirement, and the practice of thinking and reaſoning by ourſelves: Truth is the offspring of ſilence, unbroken meditation,
<pb n="lxxiii" facs="tcp:0010800101:72"/>and thoughts often reviſed and corrected. A fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for our own opinions, in which we chanced to be educated, that have been inculcated by parents or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that have the ſtamp of antiquity, or the ſanction of public authority. For theſe reaſons, if they may be called ſuch, many have not only ſhewn an indifference as to true principles, but have refuſed even to hear any arguments againſt their favourite imbibed opinions; though, for the ſame reaſon, had they been born in an idolatrous, Mahommedan, or Popiſh country, they muſt have been of the religion in which they were edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. Laſtly, if perſons of this turn of mind have at any time permitted the ſound of truth in their ears, and have been led to think or inquire at all, it has been ſo ſuperficial, and under the influence of ſuch prepoſſeſſion and bigotry, as have proved the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their illumination and conviction.</p>
            <p>But perhaps it will be aſked, are there not many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that obſtruct the acquiſition of truth in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, involuntary and unavoidable, ariſing from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of human reaſon? Reaſon, it is ſaid, which was once the dignity and glory of human nature, is now depraved, weakened and enfeebled by our original defection, ſo that it is at beſt a very uncertain guide with reſpect to truth or happineſs. But however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and diſabled by the fall, he is ſtill capable of diſcerning what is right or wrong in every caſe which properly concerns him; man is ſtill capable of extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his inquiries very far into other concerns; can ſearch deep into the receſſes of nature, and by ſteady. careful inquiry, joined with experience, explain many abſtruſe points in the ſyſtem of the univerſe, and illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the wiſe laws and wonderful diſpoſitions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and can it be imagined that our own proper duty as men, and truths that are of importance for us to know, are placed beyond the reach of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? This would be rendering the ſtate of man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable indeed, and reflect on the wiſdom and care of
<pb n="lxxiv" facs="tcp:0010800101:73"/>the Divine Providence. And as to the doctrines and duties of revelation, they muſt be capable of arriving at the true ſenſe of theſe too, unleſs it be a revelation unrevealed; taking it for granted, as it is clearly a doctrine of the New Teſtament, that whatever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of divine aſſiſtance is neceſſary in aid to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, they are always afforded to the diligent and well-diſpoſed. If it ſhould be aſked, how can we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly know that thoſe inward impreſſions that we feel, are really divine? The anſwer muſt be, from their correſpondence with the eternal revelation, and with the light and dictates of reaſon. And from hence it will follow, that, in the preſent ſtate of our faculties, however impaired and diſordered, we are capable of acquiring a deep and lively impreſſion of moral and divine truths. For is it out of the power of a man to conſider ſeriouſly? Is it beyond his natural abilities, to reflect often on affairs of the utmoſt conſequence? Can he have a juſt theory of the Chriſtian religion, and at the ſame time not be convinced of its intrinſic excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and infinite importance? Such an inſinuation as this redounds as little to the credit of chriſtianity, as to the honour of human nature.</p>
            <p>Should it be ſaid that man, by the original bias of his nature to evil, and its averſion to what is good, is neceſſarily diſinclined to, and indiſpoſed for reflection on ſuch ſubjects as theſe; I anſwer, the ſtrongeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclination does by no means infer an utter impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; nay, the contrary is moſt evident: for let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition be equal to what is ſuggeſted in the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, man muſt ſtill be a free agent, and have it in his power to be either virtuous or vicious, or elſe he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely incapable both of religion and moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and can we imagine that our nature is ſo odd, and ſo defective a compoſition, as to be capable of forming many good reſolutions, and of rectifying ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors of conduct in civil life, and, at the ſame time, indiſpoſed and unable to act the part of a rational,
<pb n="lxxv" facs="tcp:0010800101:74"/>moral and intelligent being, in matters of a religious nature?</p>
            <p>Here it may be proper to take notice of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal cauſes of corruptions in chriſtianity, which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally urged as another ſource of difficulty in the ſearch after religious truth, and in the ſtudy and right underſtanding the ſcriptures, in a way of private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>When chriſtianity was firſt promulgated to the world, it ſtood upon the principles of reaſon and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe; and happy would it have been for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, if they had but ſuffered it to remain upon this foundation. But men were no ſooner drawn over to it, than, deſerting their natural notions of things, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to explain it upon artificial notions. The great misfortune was, that many of its firſt converts came from the ſchools of the philoſophers; and being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with fantaſtic opinions and ſyſtems of their own, they began to garniſh, and new-model it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to every man's taſte and humour. A plain, ſimple religion, ſuch as the Chriſtian, founded upon the principle of reaſon and common ſenſe, was too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid of itſelf, and wanted ſeaſoning with philoſophy, before it could be reliſhed by thoſe primitive prelates. Here was the foundation of every hereſy, and the ſource of all that ſpurious mixture, which corrupted the purity of the goſpel, ſo ſoon after its eſtabliſhment. The philoſophy of Plato was the firſt in vogue amongſt Chriſtians; and this ſeems to have happened, not only becauſe this philoſophy was imagined to bear ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant reſemblance to chriſtianity; but alſo becauſe it was the beſt calculated to flatter that enthuſiaſtic turn of mind, which unhappily prevailed in thoſe early times.</p>
            <p>If then we would ſhew ourſelves wiſe men and good Chriſtians, let us be concerned only for truth; and in order to find it, conſider calmly, and examine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially; let not indolence enervate and ſtupify our minds, let not prejudice captivate and enſlave us; let
<pb n="lxxvi" facs="tcp:0010800101:75"/>not ſenſuality unfit us for intellectual exerciſes, let not ſuperſtition make us weak and childiſh, and taint all our principles, with reſpect to the very eſſentials of religion; but rather let us cultivate an honeſt candid temper, and let the evidences of truth have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed influence on our minds.</p>

This has been manifeſtly the caſe in all ages; men have always had different opinions about religion, ſuch, at leaſt, as have had the liberty to make uſe of their reaſon and judgment in it. This no doubt was the caſe of the apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in things wherein they were not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpired or directed. And how manifeſtly was it the caſe of others of the firſt Chriſtians? Some believed they might eat all things; others, that were weak, believed that they might eat only herbs.

It was ſuch an inſtance of preſumption, as was practiſed by thoſe Jews who believed in Chriſt, and acknowledged him to be the Meſſiah, againſt the ſentence of the great Sanhedrim, and of thoſe Scribes and Phariſees who ſat in the chair of Moſes. The ſame diſpoſition was alſo the foundation of the reformation of the church of England, and of all Proteſtant churches. The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and ſuperſtitious practices they renounced, being confirmed by many general councils, as agreeable to ſcripture, or confirmed and handed down to them by catholic tradition, and which all Chriſtians have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar obligation to, as they would not prejudice the purity of the faith, which was once delivered to the ſaints, and hold faſt the profeſſion of it without wavering.</p>
               <p>Many points of the Chriſtian doctrine are not mere matters of ſpeculation, in which perſons of different denominations are divided in their ſentiments; but many of them are equally the concern of all, and will ever remain of ſuch importance, that, till Chriſtians are well acquainted with and confirmed in them, no one can be inexcuſable that has opportunities to inquire, to remain ignorant of them. Such in general are the great principles and rules of human conduct; and what is next to it, are thoſe truths of religion, that have a proper rational influence on our conduct, to animate us in the practice of virtue, and deter us from vice. Of this kind are inquiries concerning our own ſtate and circumſtances, as reaſonable and accountable beings; that God is the moral Governor of his rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and that there will be a ſtate of futurity, in which will be a righteous retribution, according to men's actions in this life.</p>

               <p>Now, the doctrines and duties of a revelation men muſt be capable of underſtanding the ſenſe of ſo much as is neceſſary, or elſe it is a revelation unrevealed; for to ſuppoſe that a farther ſupernatural and inward illumination, is abſolutely neceſſary to give a right and juſt idea of ſcripture doctrines, is, in effect, to aſſert that the ſcriptures are of no uſe at all; and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal teaching, is the only revelation of the mind of God to mankind. But here again a conſiderable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty occurs, and that is, how we can poſſibly know that this inward teaching is really divine, but from its correſpondence with the external revelation, and with the light and dictates of reaſon; and conſequently without admitting that the external revelation may be underſtood without it, and that reaſon is the eternal ſtandard of truth.</p>
               <p>But there are a variety of difficulties ſtarted, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the knowledge of the true ſenſe of ſcripture, which deſerve to be taken notice of in this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. It is ſaid the New Teſtament cannot be well underſtood without the Old, which was for the moſt part wrote in Hebrew, and for the underſtanding of which a good knowledge of the oriental language is neceſſary. That a great part of the ſcriptures are wrote in a ſtile extremely figurative; and thoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, ſuch as this part of the world are very great ſtrangers to; and conſequently the verſion of books,
<pb n="lxxxii" facs="tcp:0010800101:81"/>little underſtood from their language and ſtile, muſt be extremely difficult. And if the knowledge of the Old Teſtament could be diſpenſed with, the language of the New Teſtament is not to be underſtood without much pains. The ſtile indeed, in the hiſtorical part, is plain; yet there are great difficulties in the doctrinal parts. The whole is wrote in the ſtile adapted to the Jews, and the idiom is Hebrew or Syriac, though the words be Greek, which renders ſome knowledge of this language the more neceſſary. I might add, that it requires a good knowledge of the Jewiſh ſtate, at the time of our Saviour's coming; a knowledge of their government, Sanhedrim, ſynagogue worſhip, cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, traditions, opinions, ſects, &amp;c. A farther dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty ariſes from the ſublimity of ſome of its peculiar doctrines, and the excellency of ſome of its precepts, as appearing incongruous to their antient maxims, principles, and prepoſſeſſions
<note n="*" place="bottom">Abſtracts from Biſhop Hare's Difficulties, &amp;c. that attend the ſtudy of the ſcriptures.</note>.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As to the difficulties ariſing from the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, a common critic will make ſome allowances for the deficiencies and redundancies that might be pointed out in books of ſuch great antiquity, as the books of the Old Teſtament confeſſedly are: and when ſeveral of thoſe books treat of the ſame matters, and relate the ſame facts, a candid reader will ſupply what appears deficient in one, by what appears com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in the other; and more eſpecially when we can attain to the general view and deſign, make the moſt favourable conſtruction of ſuch as appears harſh and difficult, and content ourſelves with being unable to account for ſome ſeeming contradictions, as in many caſes it may be ſeen to be an omiſſion in the tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Thus, 2 Sam. xxiv. 1. it is written, The anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael, and he moved David againſt them to ſay, Go number Iſrael and Judah. And 1 Chron. xxi. 1. it is ſaid, And Satan
<pb n="lxxxiii" facs="tcp:0010800101:82"/>ſtood up againſt Iſrael, and provoked David to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Iſrael; and God was diſpleaſed with the thing; v. 7. therefore he ſmote Iſrael. And ſome of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of ſcripture, with their application, ſeems to ſtand in need of the ſame candid compariſon of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and other circumſtances, to come at the right knowledge of them. The relation given of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in our Saviour's life and doctrine, are in ſome minute circumſtances differently related by the Evangeliſts; but in no material and eſſential points.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is plain the orthodox faith is not founded on a nice and critical knowledge of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; many of the primitive Chriſtians were no great critics, but argued very much in a myſtical way. Origen in particular, who was the greateſt ſcholar chriſtianity had bred to that time, perpetually turns the letter of ſcripture into allegory; from whence we may reaſonably conclude, that the knowledge of the pure literal ſenſe was, in the judgment of many, even in thoſe times, thought to be of little uſe.</p>
               <p>But it is certain, that the original language of the Old Teſtament was known to very few for the firſt ſix centuries, in which thoſe general councils were held, wherein all the articles of the orthodox faith were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled; they governed themſelves, and determined all their points by the Greek verſion. Now, if an exact and critical knowledge of the ſcriptures was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the ſettling the faith, it cannot be neceſſary to the underſtanding it, or to the underſtanding thoſe who have wrote in the explication of it: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſuch a knowledge tends to leſſen our eſteem of the fathers of the church, by diſcovering their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, and muſt weaken our regard to the deciſion of councils, by expoſing the falſeneſs of the ground they ſeem to be built on. A man well ſkilled in the fathers and councils, will often find texts of ſcripture are very inſufficiently or improperly applied; which ſuggeſt
<pb n="lxxxiv" facs="tcp:0010800101:83"/>to us another reaſon why it may ſeem that ſuch a ſtudy can do no good
<note n="*" place="bottom">Hare's Difficulties and Diſcouragements, p. 9.</note>.</p>
               <p>Our learned author likewiſe enumerates many other arguments againſt an exact and careful ſtudy of the ſcriptures, as, 1. That the ſubſtance of the orthodox faith is compriſed in the liturgy and articles of the church of England; which is a ſhort way as could be wiſhed for, knowing all that is neceſſary to be known, eſpecially as this will lead to the knowledge of all uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful truths, without the hazard of falling into any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous opinions. 2. As it is a fundamental principle among Proteſtants, that whatever is neceſſary to be believed is plainly revealed in the ſcriptures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently what is not plainly and clearly revealed in them, cannot be neceſſary: now if what is plain and clear in ſcripture, is the only part neceſſary to be known; then a laborious ſearch into the obſcurer parts may ſeem unneceſſary, to the obtaining a true orthodox faith. 3.

That where perſons have attempted a free and impartial ſearch into the literal ſenſe of the ſcriptures, above the reſt of the Chriſtian world, they have ſometimes purchaſed their pretended knowledge of the ſcriptures at the expence of their reputation; and their ſtudy has deſtroyed their orthodoxy, and you will be cenſured as a heretic, a term which there is a ſtrange magic in; though it has no determinate meaning in the mouth of the people; whilſt the orthodox man lives quiet and at eaſe, unmoleſted and unenvied

<pb n="lxxxv" facs="tcp:0010800101:84"/>taken, and that he is all his life bound by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions made in his firſt years, as if a man was as wiſe at twenty-four, and knew as much of ſcripture and antiquity, as at fifty; and yet if he continues the ſtudy of the ſcriptures, he is not ſure he ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a year together in the ſame ſentiments. Our author farther enlarges on the danger of diſſenting from the eſtabliſhed doctrines of chriſtianity, even in thoſe times of toleration: and he concludes with ſaying, Do not flatter yourſelf, that temper, prudence and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can, in religious controverſies, get the better of indiſcreet zeal, bigotry and ſuperſtition; in ſhort, be not raſh in eſpouſing opinions, which can have no other effect, but to lay the beſt men at the mercy of the worſt. Every mean perſon, who has nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him but his orthodoxy, and owes that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps wholly to his ignorance, will think he has a right to trample on you with contempt, and aſperſe your character with violent reflections, without your having the leaſt hopes of being heard in your own defence.</p>
               <p>Our worthy prelates, after theſe remarks, and more to the ſame purpoſe, by way of reprehenſion of thoſe miniſters whoſe conduct have run counter to their duty and profeſſion, make theſe candid conceſſions.</p>
               <p>After all that has been ſaid, I am perſuaded that many readers will ſtill think what is here advanced, a ſtrange paradox, or perhaps be ſcandalized at it as a very wicked one; and will on no terms allow, that clergymen ſhould lay aſide what ought to be their chief ſtudy. And, to be ingenuous, I will confeſs I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely of the ſame mind; I am as unwilling as they can be, to admit the concluſion, that the ſtudy of the ſcriptures ſhould be deſerted; and yet cannot deny, but, humanly ſpeaking, this muſt be the conſequence from the premiſſes. If therefore we will not allow the concluſion, we muſt ſhow the premiſſes to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, and that this ſtudy will not be attended with ſo
<pb n="lxxxvi" facs="tcp:0010800101:85"/>much danger. But this we in vain attempt, if we do not our parts at leaſt, that theſe may not be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. For as long as they are, the ſtudy of the ſcriptures will certainly continue to be neglected, as it now is, and all men who contribute to theſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences in any degree, do ſo far diſcourage the ſtudy of the ſcriptures, whatever they pretend.</p>
               <p>In truth, there is nothing more abſurd, than to ſay the glorious things we do daily of the Scriptures; and, at the ſame time, make the ſtudy of them, to men of ſincere and honeſt minds, ſo extremely hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous and inconvenient. If then we would not be guilty of diſcouraging a ſtudy, which we acknowledge to be the great duty of the clergy, as we are Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; if we would be true to the fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the reformation, as Proteſtants, that the ſcriptures are the only rule of faith; let us uſe our beſt endeavours to remove the great obſtacles that lie againſt the ſtudy of them; let us do what we can, that learned men may have full liberty to ſtudy the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures freely and impartially; good encouragement given them to go through the labour and difficulties of ſuch a ſtudy, not ſlightly and ſuperficially, but with ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and diligence as the nature of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; and have leave to ſpeak their ſenſe with all manner of ſafety: that their opinions may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined fairly and with temper: that their names be not unjuſtly loaded with calumny and ſlander: that their words and actions may be interpreted with the ſame candour, as is ſhown to thoſe that differ from them: that, if what they advance be right, it may be received; if wrong, their errors may be refuted, as the miſtakes of learned men on other ſubjects; if doubtful, and the ſcriptures ſay ſo little, or ſpeak ſo obſcurely, that nothing can certainly be decided either way, that then no body may be obliged to take either ſide as neceſſary: that, whether their notions be right or wrong, their perſons may in all events be fafe, and
<pb n="lxxxvii" facs="tcp:0010800101:86"/>their maintenance not affected by it: that, as long as they live virtuouſly, and write with all due modeſty, good manners, and advance nothing that breaks in upon morality and government, they be treated in all reſpects as thoſe are or ought to be who employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any other part of uſeful learning.</p>
               <p>I muſt add, let them be never ſo much in the wrong, I can apprehend no danger from it to the church; or that the errors of a few men, can have any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able influence in oppoſition to a great body of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and learned clergy, who will be always able and ready to defend the received notions, if they can be defended; and if they cannot, it muſt be allowed they ought not. But if ſome inconveniences would ariſe from the liberty I contend for, they are nothing in compariſon of thoſe that muſt follow from the want of it.</p>
               <p>Till there is ſuch a liberty allowed to clergymen, till there is ſuch a ſecurity for their reputations, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and perſons, I fear I muſt add, till ſo difficult a ſtudy meets with proportionable encouragement; it is impoſſible a ſincere, impartial and laborious appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to it, ſhould generally prevail: and till it does, it is as impoſſible the ſcriptures ſhould be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; and till they are, they are a rule of faith in name only. For it is not the word of ſcripture, but the ſenſe, which is the rule; and ſo far as that is not underſtood, ſo far the ſcriptures are not our rule, whatever we pretend, but the ſenſe that men have put on them; men fallible as ourſelves, and who were by no means ſo well furniſhed, as the learned at preſent are, with the proper helps to find out the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſcripture. And while we take the ſenſe of the ſcriptures in this manner upon content, and ſee not with our own eyes; we inſenſibly relapſe into the principle of popery, and give up the only ground on which we can juſtify our ſeparation from the church of Rome. It was a right to ſtudy and judge of the
<pb n="lxxxviii" facs="tcp:0010800101:87"/>ſcriptures for themſelves, that our firſt reformers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted with ſo good effect; and their ſucceſſors can defend their adherence to them on no other principle.</p>
               <p>If then we are concerned for the ſtudy of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, further than in words; if we in earneſt think them the only rule of faith; let us act as if we thought ſo, let us heartily encourage a free impartial ſtudy of them; let us lay aſide that malignant, arbitrary, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting, popiſh ſpirit; let us put no fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ters on mens underſtandings, nor any other bounds to their inquiries, but what God and truth have ſet. Let us, if we would not give up the Proteſtant principle, that the ſcriptures are plain and clear in the neceſſary articles, declare nothing to be neceſſary, but what is clearly revealed in them.</p>
               <p>Then may we hope to ſee the ſtudy of theſe divine books ſo happily cultivated by the united labours of the learned, when under no diſcouragements, that all may in the main agree in the true meaning of them. Places that can be underſtood, they will agree in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding alike; ſuch at leaſt as are of conſequence to the faith. And for ſuch as are too obſcure to be cleared up with any certainty, thoſe likewiſe they will agree about, and unanimouſly confeſs they are ſuch as no article of faith can be grounded upon, or proved from. Next to underſtanding a text of ſcripture, is to know it cannot be certainly underſtood. When the clear and dark parts of ſcripture are thus diſtinguiſhed, an unity may then reaſonably be hoped for among Proteſtants in neceſſary points; and a difference of opinion in ſuch as are not neceſſary, can have no manner of ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, nor any way diſturb the peace of the church; ſince there will then be nothing left in its doctrines, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="lxxxix" facs="tcp:0010800101:88"/>or neither, or may change, as he ſees reaſon, without offence.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, a free and impartial ſtudy of the ſcriptures, either ought to be encouraged, or it ought not. There is no medium; and therefore thoſe who are againſt one ſide, which ever it be, are neceſſarily eſpouſers of the other. Thoſe who think it ought not to be encouraged, will, I hope, think it no injury to be thought to defend their opinion upon ſuch reaſons as have here been brought for it, till they give better. On the other hand, thoſe who think theſe reaſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluſive, and cannot find better, will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to confeſs, that ſuch a ſtudy ought to be encouraged; and conſequently muſt take care how they are acceſſary to ſuch practices, as in their natural conſequence cannot but tend to its diſcouragement; leſt they come into the condemnation of thoſe who love darkneſs rather than light, and for their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be finally adjudged to it. There is in this caſe no other medium between encouraging, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, but what there is between light and darkneſs. Every degree of darkneſs, is a want of ſo much light, and all want of light, is a certain degree of darkneſs. To refuſe then a greater degree of light where it can be had, is in truth to prefer darkneſs; which, in my humble opinion, can never be reaſonable or excuſable. Thoſe who are of another mind, plainly diſtruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their cauſe. Which if it can bear the light, why ſhould it not be ſhown in it? but if it cannot, it is not the cauſe of God, or of the Son of God; for God is light, and in him is no darkneſs; and the Son of God is the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world

               <p>The queſtion therefore is not in general about a difference in opinion, which in our preſent ſtate is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable; but about the very weight and importance of the things wherein Chriſtians differ, and the things wherein they agree; and it will appear that the ſeveral denominations of Chriſtians agree, both in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of religion, and in the neceſſary enforcements to the practice of it: "That the world, and all things in it, were created by God, and are under the direction and government of his powerful hand and all-ſeeing eye; that there is an eſſential difference between good and evil, virtue and vice; that there will be a ſtate of future rewards and puniſhments, according to our behaviour in this life; that Chriſt was a teacher ſent from God, and that the apoſtles were divinely
<pb n="xcii" facs="tcp:0010800101:91"/>inſpired; that all Chriſtians are bound to profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be his diſciples; that not only the exerciſe of the ſeveral virtues, but belief in Chriſt, is neceſſary in order to their obtaining the pardon of ſin, the favour of God, and eternal life; that the worſhip of God is to be performed chiefly by the heart in prayers, praiſes and thankſgiving; and as to all other points, that they are bound to live by the rules which Chriſt and his apoſtles have left them in the holy ſcriptures. Here, ſays this right reverend prelate, is a fixed, certain uniform rule of faith and practice, containing all the moſt neceſſary points of religion, eſtabliſhed by a divine ſanction, embraced as ſuch by all denominations of Chriſtians, and in itſelf abundantly ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the knowledge and practice of religion in the world.</p>
               <p>Profeſſor Turretin, of Geneva, has laid down the following principles to diſtinguiſh fundamentals,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That we are not under a neceſſary obligation to know, or believe any truth, but what is clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us, and for the belief of which God hath endowed us with neceſſary abilities.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That he alone who is Lord of life and death, that is, God, has power to determine what is neceſſary to be believed, in order to obtain ſalvation; and what error ſhall exclude men from it.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Thoſe things likewiſe which flow from theſe principles, by plain and neceſſary conſequence, muſt be added to the catalogue of fundamentals, or things neceſſary to be known.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Fundamentals are plain, adapted to common capacities.</p>
               <p n="5">V. They muſt be few in number.</p>

               <p>Dr. Foſter, in his definition of fundamentals, ſays, No article can be fundamental, but what is ſo clearly and diſtinctly revealed, as that an ordinary Chriſtian, ſincere in his inquiries, cannot miſs of the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it is not ſufficient that a propoſition be clearly revealed to make it a fundamental, but the belief of it muſt alſo be made an expreſs term of happineſs in the ſacred writings
<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Foſter's Diſcourſe of Fundamentals, p. 4.</note>.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No doctrine is a fundamental, but what is ſo plainly and diſtinctly revealed, as that an ordinary Chriſtian, ſincere in his inquiries, cannot miſs of the knowledge of it. This may be argued from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, and the relations he ſtands in to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: for certainly their kind Creator and Preſerver cannot but delight in, and ſincerely deſire their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and therefore it is not to be doubted but that he has done every thing to promote it, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his illuſtrious excellence and perfection, and with the wiſdom of his government over free crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He cannot have fixed it upon ſuch infinite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, as that they may fail of obtaining it after the moſt ſincere and diligent uſe of all the means they are capable of uſing, but muſt have made it certainly and infallibly attainable by every one who ſeeks it in the integrity of his heart. What can induce us to think the moſt good-natured Being in the univerſe to be ſuch a hard maſter? Has there been any want of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="xciv" facs="tcp:0010800101:93"/>in his diſpenſations towards mankind, which might tempt us to entertain ſuch unworthy and injurious thoughts of him? Again, can he who has been at ſuch amazing expence to redeem the human race from that deſtruction which their ſins had merited, and to raiſe our nature to its higheſt perfection of excellence and happineſs; who, that he might be juſt to his being and attributes, and yet juſtify and ſave us, delivered up his Son to death for us all; can he, I ſay, have left it ſo abſolutely precarious, whether poor, illiterate men, (who are the far greateſt part of the world) to whom eſpecially the goſpel was preached, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to whoſe capacities it ought to have been peculiarly adapted, ſhall, doing their beſt, be happy or miſerable? How then can the grand end of the life, death, reſurrection, and goſpel of his Son be anſwered? Or finally, has he ever been found falſe to his word, or failed of the accompliſhment of his promiſes, that his moſt ſolemn and ſacred declarations of his willingneſs, that all men ſhould be ſaved and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, ſhould be looked upon as inſincere, and he be repreſented as having promiſed happineſs to the greateſt part of mankind, if not upon abſolutely impoſſible conditions, upon conditions next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not ſufficient that a doctrine be clearly revealed to make it a fundamental; but an explicit belief of it muſt be made an expreſs term of happineſs in the ſacred writings. For, without doubt, there are a great many clear propoſitions, which many ſincere, honeſt Chriſtians have no explicit belief of: nor is it neceſſary they ſhould, ſince they are purely incidental, and occaſional; and either do not at all affect chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in any important points of doctrine, or practice; or if they are of conſequence, it is only as they ſerve to illuſtrate the eſſential, fundamental parts of it, which yet may be believed, though they are never obſerved, or attended to. I grant indeed, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="xcv" facs="tcp:0010800101:94"/>a Chriſtian ſees them to be clearly revealed, he is obliged to believe them: but then it is not becauſe the points of doctrine are in themſelves ſo important, as that mens ſalvation, or damnation, will be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined abſolutely by their knowledge, or ignorance of them; but becauſe they are (as he thinks) in the word of God, who is omniſcient, and ſo cannot be deceived himſelf, juſt and faithful, and ſo cannot impoſe upon his creatures; and there is ſtill this difference between any of theſe propoſitions, and thoſe which are, in the ſenſe above-mentioned, fundamental, that a man may be ſaved without explicit and particular belief of theſe; whereas the others are indiſpenſably neceſſary to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly believed, as being the eſſential, conſtitutive parts of the new covenant.</p>
               <p>And now, methinks, it ſhould be paſt diſpute, not only that Chriſt alone, as ſole king of his church, has a right to ſettle, upon what terms thoſe who are willing to become his ſubjects, muſt expect to be protected and rewarded by him; but that theſe terms are expreſsly determined; and particularly, that our Lord, out of his gracious and kind concern for <hi>his church, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood, Acts</hi> xx. 28. hath fully and clearly revealed what thoſe truths are, which are of ſuch vaſt importance, as that the happineſs of immortal ſouls depends upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit belief of them, and which therefore it ſo nearly concerns all the members of it to be apprized of. So that we may reſt ſatisfied, that whenever this is not expreſsly ſaid, with relation to any particular doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of chriſtianity, miſapprehenſions of that part of the revelations, which contains it, (if we have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it with ſincerity) will never be brought into the account againſt us at the day of judgment; but if we can be charged with nothing elſe, we ſhall be able to lift up our heads with joy and confidence in that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and awful day of trial, and ſhall be found per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and entire, in a goſpel-ſenſe wanting nothing.</p>

And what is contrary to the fundamental principles of the reformation, without which it could never have been at firſt, and now cannot conſiſtently be, defended, will not, cannot be received by any true Proteſtant, becauſe it deſtroys his very title to that name, and in the very thing which, as a Proteſtant, he receives

               <p>None therefore can have any right to impoſe their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſenſe of, or authoritatively explain thoſe articles of faith and terms of ſalvation, which Chriſt himſelf hath made. Our inquiries are to determine our aſſent to what appears truth, or to be founded upon rational and ſcripture evidence. This is the Chriſtian's rule, in oppoſition to the receiving or admitting doctrines upon the foot of human authority; in which reſpect we are to call no man maſter upon earth, ſince he is our maſter, even Chriſt. This will evidently appear,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From its being inconſiſtent with the dignity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as head of his church. As ſuch he hath given us laws, and reſerved to himſelf a right of judging our behaviour under them. There is one law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, who is able to ſave or deſtroy; who art thou that uſurpeſt this authority, and judgeſt another?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is deſtructive to the nature of religion, as religion ought to be the reſult of ſuch conceptions as we are able to form of God, and his laws in our minds. An action indeed may look ſpecious; but if it doth not flow from a real conviction of its excellence, if it be not governed by right motives, it loſes both the nature and reward of a religious action. All the expreſſions of our piety, of our reverence, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="xcviii" facs="tcp:0010800101:97"/>to God, unleſs they ſpring from an inward ſenſe of our obligation, could ſignify nothing in a right eſtimation. They could not amount to a reaſonable ſervice, becauſe not directed by reaſon and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: to ſubmit blind-fold therefore to the dictates of others, will not conſiſt with the nature of religion. Under this direction it muſt vary with cuſtoms and climates, with prevailing factions, and other incidents of life, i. e. will be juſt nothing beſides a faſhionable dreſs, and an outward form. Neither can we well expect that a religion taken up in ſuch a careleſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhould be laſting, when it has no other foundation than that of human authority; it will be liable to be ſhaken by every objection, and to be given up with as little reaſon as it was at firſt received: every little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty thrown in the way will be apt to bias an indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent mind to reſign it, and the apprehenſion of one error ſhall be taken for a preſumption of more, till an indifference comes on to all religion. This will, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, be the caſe when a profeſſion of religion is founded upon any thing but a full conviction of its truth and importance. When we have examined im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, and embraced religion upon proper princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we are moſt likely to remain ſtedfaſt, and hold faſt that which is good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An abſolute ſubmiſſion of our underſtanding to the ſenſe, which others put upon the words of Chriſt, is ſuch a voluntary neglect of thoſe powers and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, with which we are endowed, as muſt incur ſome degree of guilt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to what purpoſe have we underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reaſon, and a capacity of diſtinguiſhing truth from error, unleſs it be to direct our choice? Why ſhould we be qualified for moral agency, if we are not allowed to exert it in the moſt intereſting affairs of life, viz. our religion? How much ſoever we may pleaſe men, by being ſo obſequious and reſigned, ſurely we cannot pleaſe God, who will expect us to be and do what he has fitted us for. The account
<pb n="lcix" facs="tcp:0010800101:98"/>we muſt render at laſt to our judge, will be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal one; for every man muſt give an account of himſelf to God: there is no pleaſing God then by another man's faith and piety, no appearing at our laſt tribunal by our deputies, we muſt anſwer for ourſelves, and conſequently have a right to direct thoſe meaſures we are ſo ſtrictly accountable for. It is an unalien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able right, reſulting from the very frame of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and religion. The apoſtles, though they enjoyed extraordinary gifts, aſſumed no ſuch power over the conſciences of men; they left them to the free exerciſes of their own faculties, and commended the Bereans for ſearching the ſcriptures, to ſee what foundation their doctrine had in it
<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 12.</note>. And St. Paul, in the caſe of ſymbolizing with idolaters, appeals to the Corinthians themſelves, as capable judges, of what (he ſaid) I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge ye what I ſay

<note n="‡" place="bottom">Col. ii. 20.22.</note>. The ſame liberty they allowed to others, they claimed for themſelves; they refuſed to comply with the injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the council, not to preach any more in the name of Jeſus, and herein governed themſelves by that important and immutable principle, that they ought to obey God rather than man
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts v. 29.</note>. In this they went upon a principle, which wiſe men and philoſophers have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acknowledged. Socrates declares to his judges, that if they would give him his life, on this condition, that he ſhould teach philoſophy no more, he would refuſe it: "I love and honour you, O Athenians; but in this I chuſe rather to obey God than you

<pb n="c" facs="tcp:0010800101:99"/>to religion than to friendſhip." It is an avowed maxim, amongſt Proteſtants eſpecially, that a law iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing from an inferior authority obliges not, when it claſhes with a ſuperior. This alone can juſtify a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the eſtabliſhed church, when it is done upon principles of better information. For ſince there is a divine law, importing that every man is to take the beſt care he can of his own ſoul, and muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himſelf to God; whoever is verily perſuaded that he beſt anſwers this end, by worſhipping God in a Proteſtant diſſenting congregation, not only may, but is obliged to follow that courſe, which upon trial he finds moſt for his ſpiritual advantage. Again, this condemns thoſe who make the civil law, or the law of the country where they live, the rule of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in matters of right and wrong; for the thing to be conſidered is not what the law of men permit; but what the law of God, natural or revealed, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines in any caſe
<note n="*" place="bottom">Grove's Syſtem, vol. II. p. 112.</note>. So likewiſe we find that in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things St. Paul claimed a right to judge of their expediency in reſpect to time, or the effect his conduct might have upon others: wherein he declares he would ſubmit himſelf to the direction and judgment of no man but himſelf; all things are lawful but one, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any
<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. vi. 12.</note>. This was the principle he went upon both with regard to himſelf and others; let every man be fully perſuaded in his own mind
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. xiv. 5.</note>. Thus the apoſtles conſidered the religion of Jeſus, as the cauſe of God and of truth, that needed no colouring to heighten its beauty, no mean arts and diſguiſe to ſupport its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; they went forth to propagate the goſpel, armed with truth, integrity and patience; and preached the goſpel with ſuch an open freedom, as ſhewed they feared no inquiry and examination, that was fair and
<pb n="ci" facs="tcp:0010800101:100"/>impartial; and ever ſince we ſee that chriſtianity hath ſtood the teſt, and preſerved its credit againſt all the attempts of art and violence.</p>
               <p>Again, an implicit regard to the interpretations and dictates of others is not conſiſtent with that veneration and eſteem we ought to have for the holy ſcriptures. Nothing appears more evident than that they were deſigned for common uſe and inſtruction. This par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity appears from their being written in their then vulgar tongue; from their addreſs to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, and the expreſs acknowledgment of the perſons concerned in them. With reſpect to the Old Teſtament, our Saviour encouraged the reading of them, and imputed the errors of the Sadducees about the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to their ignorance of the ſcriptures
<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xxii. 29.</note>. St. Paul aſſerts, that what were written aforetime were written for our learning
<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. xv. 4.</note>. With reſpect to the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, St. John declares, that he wrote his goſpel, that we might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt
<note n="‡" place="bottom">John, xx. 31.</note>; St. Luke his for the inſtruction of Theophilus
<note n="§" place="bottom">Luke i. 34.</note>. St. Paul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes his epiſtles to whole churches, and directs that his epiſtles be read to all the brethren; and injoins the Coloſſians, that the epiſtles he wrote to them and the Laodiceans might be communicated to one another for their mutual comfort
<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Theſ. v. 17.</note>: and St. Peter informs us, that his deſign in writing his epiſtles was to ſtir up the minds of Chriſtians, by way of remembrance, that they might be mindful of the words which were ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apoſtles of the Lord and Saviour
<note n="**" place="bottom">2 Peter, iii. 12.</note>. And it is evident from the epiſtles themſelves, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch doctrines as are expreſsly mentioned in the goſpels, or fairly conſiſtent with them, i. e. ſuch as we might expect from thoſe who were deſigned by our Saviour to give a fuller account of his religion. From hence it appears, that the ſcriptures were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="cii" facs="tcp:0010800101:101"/>for common uſe; and this evidently implies, that God has revealed his will there with ſufficient plainneſs in all important points, or believe what is more abſurd, that he has given us a revelation that wants another to explain it; and of conſequence it muſt be every man's right to have the free uſe of the ſcriptures, and a liberty of judging of the true meaning of them, and of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrines and principles or Chriſtianity from an inward conviction and full perſuaſion of their truth, reaſonableneſs, and excellency, and not received as the effect of chance, cuſtom, intereſt, implicit faith, or any other motive beneath the dignity of the Chriſtian religion
<note n="*" place="bottom">Conſult on this ſubject Dr. Watts's Logic, p. 225. &amp; ſeq.</note>.</p>
               <p>From hence we may reaſonably draw ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in favour of free and candid debate on matters of inquiry on religion. The great author of nature having given us certain powers and faculties, whereby we are enabled to judge between truth and error, we conceive it is a duty incumbent on us to apply theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers to that generous purpoſe for which they were deſigned, eſpecially as we may reaſonably expect that this very inquiry after truth ſhould be of ſome ſervice to us, in order to our advancement in virtue, as it has a moſt apparent tendency to promote a ſpirit of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and impartiality, and, above all, a ſpirit of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For it ſhould be obſerved, that there is not only a natural inquiſitiveneſs in mankind, but alſo a natural ſanguineneſs to ſupport their reſpective tenets; and hence, for want of attending to that common right, which every one has of thinking for himſelf, infinite uncharitableneſs, harſh cenſure, moroſe or ſhy beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, have unhappily prevailed. Now, whatever tends to baniſh this narrow and unſocial ſpirit out of the world, muſt be allowed greatly beneficial to mankind in common. And ſince the ſame reaſons that prove inquiry reaſonable, implies that we ought to uſe all the means within our power for information, I am inclined
<pb n="ciii" facs="tcp:0010800101:102"/>to think every unbiaſſed reader will admit a free friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debate is one proper expedient for the acquiſition of truth; eſpecially as oftentimes it affords an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of hearing ſuch objections advanced by our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, as we were not only ignorant of before, but often furniſh us with the proper anſwer to thoſe objections, by another hand, which our then preſent ſuperficial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into that point had not ſuggeſted to us. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in his ordinary connections and intercourſe with others, will ſometimes unhappily fall into the company of perſons, where he may have his faith perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of its proper ſupports, by means of ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til reflections, and probably be hardly able to ſtand the ſhock; whilſt the diligent inquirer after truth, from the advantages he has reaped from converſation with the judicious, and frequent debate on the ſubject of inquiry, will be able to vindicate the cauſe of truth, and not only anſwer the ſubtil objections of his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, but ſilence, and perhaps convince his opponent. This may be illuſtrated by an application of it to the right of private judgment, the eſtabliſhing rational religion in the room of ſuperſtition and enthuſiaſm, but will be found of equal uſe to aſcertain and enforce the genuine principles and duties of our holy religion againſt ſceptics and deiſts. This will be farther conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered under the advantages of free inquiry

               <p>The reaſon of man is as little able to ſtand by itſelf, or proceed alone through the ſeveral branches of uſeful ſcience, as his perſonal ſtrength is to defend himſelf againſt the violence of every invader: for both theſe ends he ſtands in need of the counſel and aſſiſtance of others. The commerce of ſcience and learning is as naturally advantageous for defence, ornament or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, as any of the common conveniencies of life. Nature ſeems to point out to us the neceſſity of ſuch a communication of knowledge, by diſtributing to different perſons, taſtes and capacities for different
<pb n="civ" facs="tcp:0010800101:103"/>inquiries and ſcience, which through the imperfect na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man cannot be compleated at once, owes its progreſſion to theſe very cauſes, that not being obliged continually to renew the labour of invention, we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove upon the ſtock of others, and daily increaſe the precious depoſit. This is the only patrimony which can deſcend from one mind to another; and which, whatever it is that we derive from our anceſtors, if we are not unjuſt or idle managers, we ſhall tranſmit with freſh improvements to poſterity. It is likewiſe what we impart to others without envy, and grow richer by an exchange of thoughts and conceptions.

               <p>It is the obſervation of Dr. Foſter, that there is not a more valuable bleſſing in human life than liberty. Civil liberty is the baſis of all ſocial happineſs; and liberty of conſcience, the only foundation of a rational religion. When the latter is reſtrained, we are treated rather like brutes than men, i. e. creatures endowed with moral powers, and accountable for actions: and therefore, it is one of the chief excellencies of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, and very far from the air and ſpirit of an impoſture, that it preſerves the rights of conſcience ſacred and inviolable. But, becauſe the world is apt to run into extremes, the writers of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like perſons who had a thorough knowledge of human nature, have taken care in this reſpect, as well as in all others, to guard againſt exceſs and irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Thus St. Paul adviſes the Galatians not to
<pb n="cv" facs="tcp:0010800101:104"/>miſtake licentiouſneſs for Chriſtian liberty; or in other words, not to imagine, that becauſe they were freed from the expenſive and burthenſome obſervances of the Moſaic inſtitution, which are elegantly deſcribed as a ſtate of ſervitude, they were diſcharged likewiſe from moral obligations, which are an eternal and immut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able law to all rational beings. I ſhall enquire into ſome of the chief abuſes of <hi>free-thinking,</hi> by which it happens, that what is really the peculiar <hi>honour</hi> and greateſt advantage of our intelligent nature, becomes a reproach to it, and is attended with moſt injurious conſequences. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Embracing the principle of liberty, has ended with many in infidelity, or a disbelief of all religion. It is moſt evident, that infidelity never more abounded than in this age of <hi>free inquiry:</hi> and thoſe who are moſt looſe in their ſentiments with reſpect to the obligations of religion in general, and of Chriſtianity in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, are, in profeſſion at leaſt, enemies to bigotry and implicit faith. Nay, it may be allowed further, that it is likely they would never have gone ſuch a length as to throw off all religion, if they had continued in a blind attachment to the principles of their education, and to eſtabliſhed and popular opinions. Whence now can this ariſe? We who believe, that religion, in all the parts of it, is ſtrictly rational, can never allow that it is the natural conſequence of a free and impartial examination of it; but muſt ſuppoſe, on the contrary, that the more thoroughly it is conſidered, and the more nicely weighed in the balance of true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed reaſon, it will be the more heartily believed and ſubmitted to. This melancholy event may however be ſufficiently accounted for from other cauſes; and that it not only may, but oftentimes does proceed, not from a ſuperior underſtanding, or more adequate and enlarged views of things, but from ignorance, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial inquiry, and even from that prejudice and impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit faith, which the monopolizers of reaſon and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
<pb n="cvi" facs="tcp:0010800101:105"/>ſo loudly diſclaim. I would not be thought, by any thing I am now advancing, to diſcourage the moſt rational and free examination of all religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, be they ever ſo ſacred and venerable, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted down with ever ſo much awe and ſolemnity by our forefathers; nor would I be thought to aſſert, that any man is obliged to receive a revelation, which, upon mature deliberation, appears to be unworthy of God, and repugnant to the reaſon and nature of things: for my only deſign is to point out ſome falſe principles, which are all an abuſe of the true principle of liberty; and by which it is highly probable, many of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed admirers, and zealous eſpouſers of it, have been led to a diſregard both of revealed and natural religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another abuſe of the principle of liberty is this, that ſome men ſeem to think, that becauſe they have a right to reject all pretended principles of religion, which are contrary to reaſon, to the perfections of the ſupreme Being, and the eternal laws of piety and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, they may likewiſe throw off the belief of every thing that they cannot fully account for; and are no more obliged, for example, to believe a Providence, becauſe the viſible courſe of things is perplexed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, full of diſorder and ſeeming injuſtice, and not ſuch as they imagine it would be, if the univerſe was governed by an abſolutely wiſe and good Being; than they are to receive ſuch doctrines as aſſert that God is a rigorous, ſevere, and inexorable Sovereign, one that delights in the miſery of his creatures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the neceſſary and unalterable diſtinction between moral good and evil. This, I ſay, is another too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon abuſe of the principle of liberty, leading to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief even of the firſt principles of natural religion; an abuſe that argues great <hi>narrowneſs</hi> of mind, and is what perſons of any <hi>compaſs</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> of thought cannot be guilty of
<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Foſter of the Abuſes of Free-thinking, vol. I. p. 127 &amp; ſeq.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="cvii" facs="tcp:0010800101:106"/>3. Some again ſeem to miſtake liberty for a right to diſpute every thing, and cavil at all religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which are commonly received, merely to ſhew that they are free-thinkers; the great delight of theſe people, who are often to be met with, is to puzzle a controverſy, and ſtart objections againſt ſome point or other of revealed religion; not from a deſire of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them <hi>conſidered</hi> and <hi>ſolved,</hi> but either to ſhew their <hi>parts,</hi> or for the ſake of embarraſſing and diſtreſſing weak minds, who having, perhaps, neither capacity nor leiſure for cloſe thinking, cannot ſee through the ſophiſtry of their pretended arguments. Such perſons are, generally ſpeaking, the furtheſt that can be from <hi>freedom</hi> and largeneſs of mind: for either they will not ſtay to hear their objections confuted, which is the leaſt that can be expected from a <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>ingenious</hi> ſpirit; or, if they are gravelled and confounded, make a ſhift to forget it ſoon, and repeat the ſame empty ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils over again to the next company they meet, with as much unconcernedneſs and aſſurance as if they had never received any anſwer to them. Whether theſe men are really in <hi>ſentiment</hi> againſt religion, or whether they diſpute only for their <hi>diverſion,</hi> or from a <hi>talkative</hi> humour, or an odd affectation of an uncommon ſpirit of liberty, I will not take upon me to determine. However this be, they cannot take it amiſs, if they are ranked on the ſide of <hi>infidelity,</hi> becauſe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways talking againſt religion, but never defending it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is an abuſe of liberty to proſtitute it to the mean and narrow view of a party-ſpirit. If the right of judging for ourſelves was the only concern, why could not men be content to uſe it for themſelves, and encourage the impartial exerciſe of it in others? But to urge it only with a view to procure attention, and thereby gain an opportunity of ſtarting difficulties, and of recommending a particular ſet of writers; to urge it on purpoſe to unſettle mens principles, diſturb ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, or ſecure ſome private ends, this is to act a low
<pb n="cviii" facs="tcp:0010800101:107"/>ungenerous part. If any thing honourable was aimed at, why could this not be done without abuſe? Is it not perfectly abſurd to contend for the right of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ourſelves, and at the ſame time to reproach thoſe who uſe that right (and happen to differ from us) with weakneſs, impartiality, and implicit faith; as if nobody was free, but in a particular way of thinking, and no other evidence could be given of it, but the cavilling at received opinions, and renouncing the principles of Chriſtianity; as if every one was enſlaved by prieſts, who reaſoned in favour of the mediatorial ſcheme, or deſerved to be ridiculed, who adhered to his Bible? This is not reaſoning, but raving, the true ſpirit of faction, and the very eſſence of bigotry. To contend for liberty in this manner is quite to miſtake it, and make the plea for it an introduction only to a new and worſe ſervitude
<note n="*" place="bottom">Milner's Religious Liberty aſſerted.</note>.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another abuſe of the principle of liberty is this, that it has led many who have not proceeded ſo far as a downright disbelief of all religion, to pay no regard, or at moſt but a ſlight and trifling regard to <hi>inſtrumental</hi> and poſitive duties. But from hence it has been infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the inſtrumental duties of piety are not only <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> but <hi>hurtful;</hi> and that an inward venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſteem of the Deity, improved by frequent and ſerious meditation, is ſufficient, without any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtated acts of worſhip, and all that is fit for us to peform, or our Maker to expect: but how does this follow, is it a juſt concluſion, that becauſe ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and enthuſiaſm are miſchievous things, therefore a rational devotion, that is allowed to have no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, but as it is ſubſervient to moral purpoſes, cannot be helpful to us in purſuit of virtue. By no means: To preſerve a ſenſe of God and his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the world, is a deſign that I ſhould think ought to be approved by all wiſe and good men. The giving thoſe publick honours to the Deity, has a direct
<pb n="cix" facs="tcp:0010800101:108"/>tendency this way, and is as really the concern of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural as revealed religion: to neglect theſe publick te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of our reverence and gratitude, on a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of liberty, doth not imply an exemption from the obligations of the divine authority and law. We then act freely, in every ſenſe of the word, when we act on the ſide of reaſon and piety. When we adore the Author of our beings, and aſpire in the offices of religion, to a reſemblance of his perfect purity and happineſs: if this conduct proceeds from an opinion of our ſuperior knowledge and goodneſs, we muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly forget what is the preſent condition of human nature. The beſt furniſhed mind, I apprehend, is not ſo equally attentive in all ſeaſons, as to want no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition; nor the ſtrongeſt virtue ſo perfect as to be above advice and encouragement. We may therefore infer, that the right of judging for ourſelves is not inconſiſtent with the uſe of any help or aſſiſtance; nor is inſtruction impoſition, but a ſuitable means of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving our faculties in the acquiſition of truth.</p>
               <p>Again, freedom of thought, and impartial inquiry into the principles of religion, have been abuſed and perverted, in the preſent age, by degenerating into a light, trifling frame of mind, and a humour of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacred things with <hi>ridicule.</hi> With people who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this way, liberty is nothing elſe but a free, bold manner of treating all ſubjects ludicrouſly, and turning them into a jeſt. They have a great inclination to ſhew their wit, eſpecially upon points that afford the leaſt room for it: for this diſcovers an uncommon genius; and therefore becauſe religion is the graveſt thing in the world, they reſolve to be merry with it; and think it a moſt meritorious action to laugh at what the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the world eſteem and reverence, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to put all the wiſe and virtuous part of mankind out of countenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="cx" facs="tcp:0010800101:109"/>in itſelf good, uſeful and venerable, fixes a certain reproach upon him that attempts it, either upon his underſtanding or his morals; that jeſting with things of the higheſt conſequence is folly and madneſs; that it is an eaſy matter, by miſrepreſenting, to make any thing appear ridiculous; and conſequently, that this talent is ſo far from being a demonſtration that the perſon who poſſeſſes it is a wit, as it is from being an evidence of his good-breeding, that, in violation of all the rules of decency, he banters and treats with ſcurrility the eſtabliſhed religion of his country, and that which all around him have a high value for.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the greateſt abuſe of free inquiry, is when it degenerates into licentiouſneſs, or is the occaſion of ſin. Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty, only uſe not your liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh, Gal. v. ver. 13. The apoſtle had aſſerted the Gentiles right to the bleſſings of the goſpel, without being under any obligation to ſubmit to circumciſion. But when he declared their liberty in one point, he would not have them extend it to every other; that becauſe they were free from ritual laws, they ſhould preſently conclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free from moral obligations, and under that pretence run themſelves into licentiouſneſs and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. No more ought the liberty we claim againſt the impoſitions of men, weaken our regards for the commandments for God: no notion of liberty ſhould ever tempt us to break through the obligations of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the reſtraint of divine fear: no pretence of reaſoning for ourſelves, ſhould be carried ſo far as to reaſon ourſelves out of our religion. This would be a ſad caſe indeed, as it would plunge us into the worſt of ſlaveries, that of ſin; and <hi>while they promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves liberty, they themſelves are the ſervants of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 2 Pet. ii. 19

               <p>The knowledge of religion is without diſpute and compariſon the moſt uſeful knowledge, both with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſociety in general, and to every particular member thereof, as conducing moſt to the happineſs of every individual, as well as the public good; and conſequently the ſtudy of this knowledge muſt be of the moſt importance. Nor can religious truth be at all injured by ſubmitting it to a free and open im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial inquiry
<note n="‖" place="bottom">See Dr. Lowth's Viſitation Sermon at Durham, 1758.</note>, even thoſe which are moſt difficult and abſtruſe in their nature; but inquiry will enable us to diſcover and detect the cunning and ſophiſtry by which they are miſrepreſented.</p>
               <p>It is a natural conſequence of inquiry, that it opens the mind, and prepares it for the impreſſions of truth;
<pb n="cxii" facs="tcp:0010800101:111"/>for it often happens that it diſcovers the ſprings and means of right judgment, and produces a conviction of truths, new, intereſting and ſublime; he only that ſeeks and ſearches after truth ſincerely, can with any good reaſon hope to find it, and that faith which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from inquiry will be the moſt conſiſtent and ſtable, as well as the moſt ſatisfactory and influencing. The ſcriptures always repreſent it as the duty of every reaſonable being, even with reſpect to points of faith, which are the ſubject of divine revelation, the moſt ſublime in their nature, and the moſt important as to their end, an employment honourable in the ſight of God, and worthy the Chriſtian character.</p>
               <p>There is a ſecret mental pleaſure in reſearches after truth, and eſtabliſhing our faith upon a ſolid founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is a ſanction which God has annexed to his laws, ariſing from the very conſtitution of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo much the more powerful, becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and conſtant: this thirſt after knowledge, like other appetites increaſes by being gratified, but with this happy difference, that it increaſes by being indulged, and the pleaſure it leaves behind, is as grateful as the appetite was eager before.</p>
               <p>The field of knowledge is large and ſpacions; there is room enough for every genius to exert itſelf upon objects ſuitable to its taſte; it helps us to ſpend our time agreeably, and ſweetens the cares of life with many pleaſing thoughts and reflections; it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of knowledge that feeds the mind with new and agreeable repaſts, and furniſhes it with ſuch infinite variety of pleaſing views, that time never ſeems bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome or tedious; hence it was that Africanus ſaid, he was never leſs alone, than when alone.</p>
               <p>The purſuit and acquiſition of truth is a natural and proper means of regulating our paſſions, and of avoiding thoſe diſcompoſures which are too apt to ruffle and perplex the ſoul; it tends to introduce a calm ſerenity of mind, which is itſelf one of the greateſt
<pb n="cxiii" facs="tcp:0010800101:112"/>enjoyments of life, and gives a grateful reliſh and ſtability to all our other enjoyments.</p>
               <p>A man of an extenſive knowledge, the natural reſult of inquiry, is beſt qualified to be uſeful and beneficent to his fellow creatures, to aſſiſt them under doubts and difficulties, to ſet them right with regard to points of real importance, and to inſpire them with ſentiments of equity, probity, generoſity, and love of their country.</p>
               <p>Again, the pleaſures of converſation, which is one principal means for the acquiſition of knowledge, where it is conducted with freedom, friendſhip, eaſe, and improvement, is one of the greateſt ſocial amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of which human nature is capable; but which ever receive an additional ſatisfaction, as it partakes of all theſe advantages, which ſeldom fail to unite, where our own abilities qualify us for imbibing the mental ſatisfactions, and we are ſo happy as to converſe with thoſe whoſe diſpoſitions and talents form them for communicating their ſuperior ideas with clearneſs and perſpicuity.</p>
               <p>It was a free and candid inquiry that at firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the reformation, and gave it ſuch remarkable ſucceſs, progreſs, and eſtabliſhment, freed us from many of the groſs errors and ridiculous ceremonies of the church of Rome; and hence the duty and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of free inquiry was always recommended by the firſt reformers as the baſis and ſupport of liberty and truth; judging very rightly, that ignorance can never be the mother of devotion in any religion, which is a reaſonable ſervice.</p>
               <p>Error, ſuperſtition, and bigotry, can never be rooted out but by perſuading men to look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as rational creatures, and to implant in their minds rational notions of religion. Religion there can be none without a moral difference of things, a moral dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of things there cannot be where there is no place for action, and action there can be none without liberty

                  <pb n="cxiv" facs="tcp:0010800101:115"/>A free and impartial inquiry after truth, wherever it is to be found, is indeed a noble and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable diſpoſition; which every man ought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to labour after, and to the utmoſt of his power encourage in all others. It is the great foundation of all uſeful knowledge, of all true virtue, and of all ſincere religion. But when a man in his ſearches into the nature of things find his inquiries leading him into ſuch notions as, if they ſhould prove true, would manifeſtly ſubvert the very eſſences of good and evil, the leaſt that a ſober minded man can in ſuch a caſe be ſuppoſed to owe to God, to virtue, to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a rational nature, is, that he ought to be in the higheſt degree fearful and ſuſpicious of himſelf, leſt he be led away by any prejudice, leſt he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any erroneous argument, leſt he ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be impoſed upon by any wrong inclination.</p>
               <p>Our author concludes, that all ſincere lovers of truth, and liberty of free and impartial examination, are under the higheſt obligations, in reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, always to make uſe of that freedom which we ſo greatly eſteem, and ſo juſtly boaſt of, in ſuch a manner only as may give no occaſion for ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men, and lovers of darkneſs, to endeavour to retrench that liberty of inquiring after truth, upon which all valuable knowledge, and all true religion, eſſentially depend.</p>

                  <hi>Of the Diſadvantages of</hi> IGNORANCE <hi>and</hi> ERROR.</head>
               <p>It is the opinion of a late philoſopher, and I think pretty generally received, that the mind of man is at firſt but a fair unwritten paper, till it has received ſome impreſſions from without, and improved upon them by its faculties of reflection; and conſequently that it is only wiſdom and inſtruction that fills it with fair and excellent characters; that write things upon it in their natural ſhape and order; that draw them to
<pb n="cxv" facs="tcp:0010800101:116"/>the life in their true colours and poſture; and deſcribe upon it the greateſt concerns that are or have been in the world; and, by their means, it becomes a delightful ſtorehouſe of the richeſt truths and moſt valuable knowledge.</p>
               <p>Reaſon is the great perfection of human nature; but, like a diamond, it is naturally rough till education po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes it, and ſets it well; and as nothing is ſo perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of our beings, ſo much worth our care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, as a wiſe and well-improved mind; ſo a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of reaſon and underſtanding is looked upon as one of the greateſt blemiſhes of human nature. Nay, many had rather you impeach their morals than their wiſdom and underſtanding; and what is wiſdom and underſtanding, but a mind with true conceptions and lively ideas, ſtored and enriched with the knowledge of the beſt things, the opening it to the nobleſt truths? in letting it ſee and behold all things that God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſet around it, and making uſeful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by proper reflections upon them?</p>
               <p>Errors may be conſidered as more or leſs crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as they are in a higher or lower degree volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; and all error is voluntary where the cauſes of it are voluntary; as, in the firſt place, imperfect and ſuperficial inquiry, which is evidently unbecoming reaſonable creatures, who ought in all points of importance, in which their higheſt intereſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, to proceed with the utmoſt caution, or not to act with raſhneſs and preſumption; or, 2dly, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute indifference and inattention, which directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the original deſign of our peculiar and more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faculties. But, 3dly, The cauſes of religious error may ſometimes be pride, prejudice, obſtinacy, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual paſſions, darkening and controuling the judgment, and often biaſſing the will to evil.</p>
               <p>But this is to be underſtood with much reſtriction and limitation. I am ſenſible the cauſes of error are frequently involuntary. Many are under great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for want of abilities, leiſure, or opportunity,
<pb n="cxvi" facs="tcp:0010800101:117"/>and other proper and neceſſary helps for the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of knowledge; and many, I am well ſatisfied, have made very conſiderable improvements under great diſcouragements and difficulties, which, where-ever it happens, redounds much to their reputation.</p>
               <p>There are a great number of other perſons, who readily acknowledge a fitneſs and propriety in being acquainted with religious ſubjects; but perhaps they have more darling ſtudies that engage their thoughts, ingroſs their affections, and employ their time. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the ear has been captivated with muſic, or the mathematics better ſuited to their genius; or, they have made choice of ſome other learned profeſſions, upon which to employ their future ſtudies: and they have for this reaſon bid adieu to whatever is not in their nature ſubſervient to them.</p>
               <p>I would by no means undervalue other ſciences, or ſpeak of them in diminutive terms; but then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after truth, and judging for ourſelves in matters of religion, may certainly throw in its claim, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port its right to a part of our time, upon all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſolid reaſon, and the moſt ſubſtantial intereſt. For, as an ingenious author obſerves
<note n="†" place="bottom">Employment of Time, p. 64.</note>, "If by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties we enjoy, we are ſo greatly advanced above the brute creation, our ideas, our purſuits, ought to bear proportion to thoſe ſuperior capacities with which we are diſtinguiſhed from them; and how induſtrious ſhould we be to improve every opportunity, is evident from their uncertainty.

               <p>This naturally ſuggeſts to us, that there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent methods to be purſued for the attainment of truth, according to their different natures, and the evidences of which they are capable

               <p>Some of the rules and directions neceſſary to direct our inquiries, are as follow:</p>
               <p n="1">1. An humble and ſincere addreſs to the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of your being, for his favourable aſſiſtance and concurrence with you.</p>

Raſh concluſions, without duly weighing the reaſons upon which they are founded, and what evidence there may be on the oppoſite ſide, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of intelligent nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Make ſuch inferences from them as your ſober

               <p n="5">5. Never drop the inquiry till you have brought it to ſome determinate iſſue.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let your perſuaſion be unprejudiced, free as poſſible from prepoſſeſſion, and an undue attachment to the ſentiments of others, tho' under the ſanction of public authority. Nothing ought to be the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing predominant principle to direct our inquiries, but the evidence of its being the mind and will of God: and in judging of points of faith, that depends on the authority of the inſpired books, the expreſſions ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the ſcriptures ſhould be made the meaſure of interpreting ſuch as are not taken from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not the contrary.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſervation</hi> is the notice that we take of all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and concerns of human life, whether they are ſenſible or intellectual, whether relating to perſons or things, to ourſelves, or others: all things which we ſee, which we hear, or feel, which we perceive by ſenſe or conſciouſneſs, or which we know in a direct manner, with ſcarce any exerciſe of our reaſoning pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, may be included under the general name of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>

                  <pb n="cxix" facs="tcp:0010800101:120"/>
                  <hi>Reading</hi> is another and very conſiderable means or method of knowledge, whereby we acquaint ourſelves with what other men have written or publiſhed to the world in their writings; by this means we partake of the ſentiments, reaſonings, and improvements of all the learned world, in the moſt remote nations, and in former ages, almoſt from the beginning of mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Converſation</hi> is another method of improving our minds; wherein, by mutual diſcourſe and inquiry, we learn the ſentiments of others, as well as communicate our ſentiments to them in the ſame manner, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times between a teacher and learner; but the profit is frequently mutual. Under this head we may alſo rank diſputes of various kinds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Public</hi> or <hi>private lectures,</hi> are ſuch verbal inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are given by a teacher, while the learner at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends in ſilence. Thus religion is learnt from the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit-philoſophy, or theology from the profeſſor's chair, mathematics by a teacher, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meditation,</hi> or ſtudy, includes all thoſe exerciſes of the mind, whereby we render all the former methods uſeful for our increaſe in true knowledge and wiſdom. It is by meditation we come to confirm our memories of things that paſs through our thoughts in the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of life, in our own experiences, and in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations we make. It is by meditation that we draw va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inferences, and eſtabliſh in our minds general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of knowledge. It is by meditation that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the various ideas which we derive from our ſenſes, or from the operations of our ſouls, and join them in propoſitions. It is by meditation, that we fix in our memory whatſoever we learn, and form our own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth or falſhood, the ſtrength or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what others write. It is meditation or ſtudy that draws out long chains of argument, and ſearches and finds deep and difficult truths, which before lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>It would be a needleſs thing to prove, that our own
<pb n="cxx" facs="tcp:0010800101:121"/>ſolitary meditations, together with the few obſervations that the moſt part of mankind are capable of making, are not ſufficient of themſelves to lead us to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of any conſiderable proportion of knowledge, at leaſt in an age ſo much improved as ours is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of converſation and reading, and other proper inſtructions that are to be attained in our days; yet each of theſe five methods have their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar advantages, whereby they aſſiſt each other, and contribute to increaſe our knowledge.</p>

Did they diſſent without inquiring? and, if they made free to examine for themſelves, did they not, by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence, aſſert the right of every man to do the ſame for himſelf? And if this be done with care and ſincere veneration for truth, if we honeſtly endeavour to avoid every error, we may be aſſured, whatever may be the reſult of our inquiry, we ſhall not at the bar of God ſtand chargeable with voluntary ignorance and criminal miſtake.</p>
               <p>One principal part of our inquiry, as Proteſtants, is, how we ſhall ſtrip Popery of its ſtrongeſt bulwark, the pretended infallibility and authority of the church, explode their pretended miracles, and vindicate the principles of Proteſtantiſm againſt all their attempts to blacken and vilify it; vindicate the authority of Scripture as the rule of a Chriſtian's faith and worſhip, in oppoſition to tradition; point out their various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and ſuperſtitions in worſhip and diſcipline; ſhew the novelty and abſurdity of many of their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
<pb n="cxxi" facs="tcp:0010800101:122"/>diſplay the abſurdity of their pretended doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of tranſubſtantiation, the groſs preſumption of abſolution, and the immoral tendency of indulgences; and, above all, convince them of the repugnancy of perſecution to the ſpirit and practice of genuine Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: and, to do this the more effectually, acquaint yourſelf with the moſt authentic proofs of their groſs corruptions; the commencement and confirmation of them from the beſt hiſtorians of their church; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of councils and ſynods; and be able to prove the hypotheſes you advance by unqueſtionable authorities: for they will roundly deny, or artfully evade, whatever they are not qualified to vindicate; and deſpiſe the proofs brought by Proteſtants, however well ſupported. 'Tis, methinks, a laudable acquiſition to be able well to defend and ſupport the Chriſtian religion againſt the ſubtilty and artifice of thoſe enemies of our holy religion; and though I cannot point out in what part of England it is at preſent prevailing, Ireland abounds with them; and I am well informed, that in ſome counties of England their numbers are very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which ſhould animate Proteſtants to be upon their guard againſt the deluſive ſpirit of popery.</p>
               <p>A late worthy prelate obſerves
<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſtimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times.</note>, "That popiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition is a more active principle, with regard to conqueſt, than rational proteſtantiſm. The firſt piques itſelf on deſtroying and extirpating the enemies of God; the latter, regarding none as the enemies of God on account of error, aims only at a rational defence. While proteſtantiſm therefore retains its proper influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the minds of men, it may be a match for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſuperſtition; what it wants in fury, it makes up in ſteadineſs. This truth our forefathers have twice experienced in our own country." However, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, upon the whole of ſuch arguments, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſm calmly preſents herſelf to the reaſon, while popery ſeizes the paſſions of men; and hence modern
<pb n="cxxii" facs="tcp:0010800101:123"/>popery, ſet againſt modern proteſtantiſm, is in danger of overwhelming it.</p>
               <p>With regard to our own country, the ſame author remarks, that the principles of proteſtantiſm have loſt their influence or ruling-power; inſomuch that it is no injuſtice to the higher ranks of this kingdom to ſay, that the main ſecurity of the church ariſeth from its alliance with the ſtate. There is now among the Great ſuch a general indifference and ſupineneſs in, not to ſay contempt of, every thing that regards religion only, as may well alarm thoſe few who look forward to poſterity. How different a ſtate of religion is this from that which prevailed in the reign of Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, when, as Bolingbroke obſerves, the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was eſtabliſhed, not only in the outward form, but in the hearts of men!—How different from that which prevailed at the grand period of the abdication of James II. when proteſtant principles took the lead even of the ſpirit of civil liberty, and effected the moſt glorious revolution that hiſtory hath yet recorded; a revolution that might juſtly be ſtiled religious rather than political. That great religious ſpirit, which at thoſe illuſtrious periods ſhone ſo bright, is now, as it were, quenched in darkneſs!</p>
               <p>Popery advances with dreadful ſtrides in America, while proteſtantiſm lies as it were indolent and inactive; and he aſſerts, that on the continent of Europe, the Proteſtant crowns are divided one againſt each other. The popiſh crowns unite in open and ſecret confederacy. The Empreſs Queen has thrown off the maſk, and baſely deſerted thoſe who had long and often ſaved her from deſtruction. France is purſuing its old game, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing its eſtabliſhed plan of power, and is as tenacious of the popiſh doctrines and practices, as is ſubſervient to it; and, if Voltaire may be credited, theiſm is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prevailing
<note n="*" place="bottom">Voltaire's Diſcourſe on Theiſm.</note>. Their ſentiments are diſperſed thro' all religions, both abroad and at home, looking on the
<pb n="cxxiii" facs="tcp:0010800101:124"/>law of nature only as religion, and regarding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form of religion, however it may be agreeable to the preſcribed rules of the Chriſtian revelation, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant. The manifeſt inference is this, as it appears that the genius of popery is active, inſinuating, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, permanent, and unalterable; the genius of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtaniſm, calm, rational, indolent, fluctuating; at the ſame time the enemies of Chriſtianity are artful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating, and vigilant, to oppoſe its genuine doctrines; Proteſtants ought to be more watchful in the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the invaluable privileges they enjoy, and be active in the ſupport of them, by endeavouring to ſupport thoſe whom, next to God, are its bulwark and defence. It was obſerved by the late biſhop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in his ſermon on the laſt rebellion, that we are apt to boaſt of the purity of our religion, and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from the errors and corruptions of the church of Rome, and to flatter ourſelves we are the peculiar people of God, and ſet up by providence to be the bulwark of the Proteſtant religion. "But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſtill, ſays his lordſhip, that we are choſen to profeſs the truth of God's holy goſpel, and to bear our teſtimony againſt the corruptions which have prevailed over great part of the Chriſtian world. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet a true value upon the bleſſings that are beſtowed on us, and walk worthy of the light of the goſpel, which has ſhone upon us, that our conduct and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour may bear teſtimony to the truth we profeſs."</p>
               <p>Another great point of our inquiry ſhould be, the defence of the Chriſtian religion againſt the bold attacks or ſecret inſinuations of DEISTS; and it is now pretty well known, that their chief ſtrength lies not ſo much in oppoſing the ſcripture-doctrine, as thoſe miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which ſome profeſſors of chriſtianity them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have put upon it. And in this point it behoves us to call off unbelievers from their falſe ideas, and give them to underſtand the true ſtate of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy between them and us, which is too often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked
<pb n="cxxiv" facs="tcp:0010800101:125"/>by the profeſſed writers on that ſide of the queſtion. And in proof of this I need only refer my reader to <hi>Chriſtianity as old as the creation,</hi> and to a later book, called <hi>Chriſtianity not founded on argument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a truth that I believe few will deny, however to be regretted (in a land of ſo much learning, and where the Chriſtian religion has been ſo well defended) that infidelity or deiſm has become faſhionable; and this is by no means owing to the cogency of their arguments, but rather to the pains they take in making proſelytes; for which they truſt not to books alone for propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their opinions, but that in converſation they will (and actually do) endeavour to ſeduce others; the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of which if poſſible ſhould be prevented by the abilities and aſſiduity of profeſſed Chriſtians; and whilſt they cavil at revealed religion, it is our buſineſs to put them to the proofs, that mere natural religion contain more eſſential, fixed, and permanent principles, and as ſuch a wiſer and better ſyſtem; call upon them likewiſe to ſhew that they have more ſubſtantial motives to virtue, ſupported upon better evidence. Many of them at leaſt heſitate about a future ſtate; others diſcard the notion of it, and many of thoſe who profeſs to believe in a future ſtate, are in great perplexity and uncertainty about the nature and duration of the happineſs or miſery which will be aſſigned to the virtuous or the wicked. We may eaſily demonſtate to them, that the evidences of the ſanctions of the Chriſtian religion are not ſo precarious and uncertain; that we have a more ſure word of prophecy, whereunto we ſhall do well if we take heed, as unto a light ſhining in a dark place, 2 Pet. i. 19.</p>
               <p>I have occaſionally mentioned many of our eminent prelates and divines, whoſe defences of chriſtianity have done honour to their names, their country and their religion, and ſufficient, a Chriſtian would readily imagine, to ſatisfy every unprejudiced opponent. But if this is not ſo, ſomething more becomes our duty; we
<pb n="cxxv" facs="tcp:0010800101:126"/>are not to give up with indifferency the great articles of our holy religion; but, as far as in us lies, ſhew our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves always ready, and always able to confute their ſtrongeſt arguments, and explode their ludicrous cavils.</p>
               <p>But it would be no difficult matter, if we would give ourſelves time to deliberate on the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſome of their tenets, ſuch as the doctrine of materiality, that God is nature, nature God, &amp;c. to ſhew that deiſm, of which this is one of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite ſentiments, has a direct tendency to ſap the foundation of our happy conſtitution, both in church and ſtate, and directly repugnant to the eſtabliſhed and tolerated religion, and municipal laws of this kingdom, and particularly in the teeth of an act of parliament, now in force againſt prophaneneſs and immorality, made not only ſince the reformation, but alſo ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, and toleration of liberty of conſcience, by confeſſedly a number of as wiſe men, and great abilities as ever graced a ſenate. See 9 &amp; 10 of K. William III. Seſſ. 20. cap. 32
<note n="*" place="bottom">P. S. We ſhall have occaſion to treat of the different ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of deiſts in another place.</note>.</p>
               <p>But beſides thoſe peculiar obligations to acquaint ourſelves with the principal arguments, in defence of the Chriſtian religion, againſt the objections of modern deiſts, and on every proper occaſion to vindicate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and authority of the Chriſtian revelation, the ſcripture not only requires that every man be fully perſuaded in own mind, but that he is able to give an account of the faith that is in him, with meekneſs and fear, and reaſon coincide with it, as it is not only the juſt foundation of our ſtability in the Chriſtian principles, but a conſcious evidence of our having embraced them upon ſuitable authority.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who make profeſſion of the religion eſtabliſhed by law, ought at all times, not only to be acquainted with the principles of that religion, but at the ſame time
<pb n="cxxvi" facs="tcp:0010800101:127"/>be able to offer ſomething pertinent, and convincing that they have not undertaken that profeſſion in complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to eſtabliſhed articles only; but from their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be founded on arguments more ſubſtantial and influencing, ſuch as to them appear agreeable to the ſacred ſcriptures, which is allowed the ſtandard of truth to all proteſtants, according to the ſixth article of the church of England, and many of the canons of that church. This may be applied to the principal doctrines contained in their articles, diſcipline, mode of worſhip, ceremonies, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To ſuch as profeſs to differ from the eſtabliſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it behoves them in a particular manner to ſhew the reaſonableneſs of their ſeparation, that no falſe bias, no contempt of the authority of the legiſlator, a love of ſingularity or novelty, but a thorough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that the tenets they profeſs are more agreeable to Scripture and reaſon; that the worſhip they engage in is more ſimple, ſpiritual, and edifying; that the diſcipline practiſed in thoſe churches is more conducive to the purity of faith, the regularity of conduct, and the peace and good order of ſociety. If the tenets or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that ſociety of which they profeſs themſelves members, though few in number, are the peculiar characteriſtics of that ſociety or denomination, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them more eſpecially to be able to ſhew their ſignificance and importance, as having their immediate foundation in the ſacred writings, and therein declared to be of indiſpenſible obligation

                  <p>When the kingdom of the Meſſiah approached, John the Baptiſt was appointed and ſent by God, to preach and exhort his hearers to repentance, and to forſake every courſe of vice, and thereby to prepare their minds for the reception of that diſpenſation, and the fit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that kingdom, in which eternal and immutable righteouſneſs ſhould be chiefly and ultimately recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>

                  <p>And if we examine the writings of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhall find that one end and deſign of our Lord, in laying a foundation for thoſe friendly ſocieties,
<note>Nature and deſign of the Chriſtian Church.</note> was, that his diſciples being united, and living under the power and influence of his goſpel, might be actuated by a friendly and brotherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to encourage, ſupport and comfort each other under every difficulty, and, by a good example, to provoke one another to love and to good works.</p>
                  <p>Another valuable purpoſe intended to be anſwered hereby, was, that thoſe ſocieties might be lights to the world, become public examples of virtue, and thereby recommend the goſpel to more general accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

Lord! ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doth the will of my Father, which is in Heaven.</hi> And our Lord, ver. 24, 25, ſays, <hi>Therefore, whoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him to a wiſe man who built his houſe upon a rock;</hi> hereby intimating, that it was the Chriſtians beſt ſecurity in times of trial, not merely profeſſing Chriſt, or giving him the higheſt appellation, nor even propheſying in his name, would recommend them to the rewards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in his goſpel, without a temper of mind and courſe of life conformable thereto.</p>
                  <p>To believe in, and ſubmit to be governed by the laws of Chriſt, are what denominate a Chriſtian, and contract the relation betwixt him and them, and which conſtitute him the head, and they the members of his body; ſo that Chriſtians, as Chriſtians, have no other head, that is, they have no other authoritative power or governor over them, but their one common head or governor, viz.

                  <p>Chriſt is therefore repreſented as the Chriſtian's patern, an excellent and worthy example of every good word and work.
<note>Chriſt the Chriſtian's Patern.</note> Chriſt preached his own life, and lived his own doctrine, and thereby he was at once a ſtanding monument of the practicableneſs of virtue, and of the preſent peace and happineſs that flows from it; in him we have an example of a quiet and peaceable ſpirit of modeſty and uprightneſs, of benevolence and charity towards men, and of devotion and piety towards God, in which, ſo far as his diſciples are careful to imitate their lord and maſter, they would recommend his doctrines to the world.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt did not lay a foundation by his doctrine, or encourage by his example, that, among his Diſciples and followers, ſome ſhould be ſingled out from their brethren, to be poſſeſſed of great revenues, live in ſtately palaces, wallow in luxury and eaſe, and lord it over thoſe by whoſe labours they are maintained; placed on thrones, or garniſhed ſtalls, and ſeats of honour, aſſuming and exerciſing dominion over their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0010800101:136"/>brethren; and that others ſhould be ſubject to them, bow down to them, and call them Rabbi! Rabbi! as though they were inveſted with divine authority and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, that, on the contrary, he has ſtrictly forbid it, Matt. xx. 25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>But Jeſus called them</hi> (viz. his diſciples) <hi>unto him, and ſaid, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exerciſe dominion over them, and they that are great exerciſe authority upon them; but it ſhall not be ſo among you; but whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your miniſter, and whoſoever will be chief among you, let him be your ſervant; even as the Son of Man came not to be miniſtered unto, but to miniſter,</hi> chap. xxiii. 8, 9, 10. <hi>But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your maſter, even Chriſt; and all ye are brethren.

                  <p>As Chriſt propoſed his own example for his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to imitate; ſo, in a particular and ſpecial manner, he recommended humility, and gave them an example of his own great condeſcenſion, in performing the meaneſt office to his diſciples, in the inſtance of waſhing their feet, which is related at large, and with the plaineſt injunction to his diſciples, to go and do likewiſe, John xiii. 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>But as our Lord foreſaw, from the moſt probable circumſtances, that there would be ſome difference of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, ſome whoſe principles and conduct would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the genuine ſimplicity of his goſpel,

                  <p>And as if our Lord had particularly intended to guard all thoſe who called themſelves his diſciples, againſt perſecution for conſcience ſake, and of deſtroying mens lives under the pretence of promoting the cauſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his goſpel, he ſtrictly commands that the tares and the wheat grow together till the harveſt.</p>
                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt hath likewiſe given Chriſtian ſocieties ſome cautions and directions, with reſpect to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, Matt. vi. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>But when ye pray, uſe not vain repetitions, as the heathens do,

Here Chriſtians are taught to direct their prayers to God the Father, whoſe paternal kindneſs diſpoſes him to do more abundantly for his dutiful children than they can aſk or think.— Another encouraging motive to prayer, which our Lord gave to his diſciples, was, that they ſhould aſk the Father in his name, John xvi. 23. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall aſk the Father in my name, he will give it you;</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by aſſuring them that God the Father had dignified his own Son,

                  <p>Thus we ſee the foundation of the Chriſtian church, as it was laid by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf: what were the qualifications requiſite to conſtitute the members of it; what were the ends to be propoſed and anſwered by ſuch ſocieties; and what were the benefits that would ariſe from thence; namely, that his voluntary and faithful perſevering followers, ſhould enter into the kingdom of heaven, and enjoy eternal life.</p>
                  <p>And that the goſpel might be preached to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, might be brought under its influence, and conſequently might ſhare in its benefits,
<note>The apoſtles commiſſioned.</note> Chriſt choſe twelve men, (of which one proved a traitor to him, and to fill up whoſe place Matthias was choſen) to be with him in his preaching and miniſtry among the Jews, to be witneſſes of what he both taught and did, and whom he intended to appoint and qualify to preach the ſame goſpel to the reſt of mankind. And accordingly Chriſt, after he was put to death by the Jews and Romans, roſe again from the dead, on purpoſe that he might ſtrictly charge and command, and that he might excite and enable theſe his apoſtles to preach his goſpel as aforeſaid, and thereby purſue the great end and purpoſe of his coming. Luke xxiv. 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and ariſe from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0010800101:139"/>all nations, beginning at Jeruſalem. And ye are witneſſes of theſe things; and behold I ſend the promiſe of my Father unto you, but tarry ye in the city of Jeruſalem until ye ſhall be endued with power from on high.</hi> This promiſe of the Father, or the enduing them with power from on high, was made good to them at the feaſt of Pentecoſt. Matt. xxviii. 18, 19. <hi>And Jeſus came and ſpake unto them, ſaying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth: go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> To the perſons before-mentioned were afterwards added two more, viz. Paul and Barnabas, that in the exerciſe of their miniſtry, up and down the world, theſe fourteen apoſtles might offer to all, without diſtinction, the goſpel of Chriſt, and by their preaching and example encourage others voluntarily to become Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>The publication of the goſpel being ordained as the means to call, and engage, and prevail with ſinners, in conſideration of the proofs thereby given, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits therein offered, to believe in Chriſt as the promiſed Meſſiah, and to take him with their whole hearts to be their ſole teacher, lawgiver, and judge; to make open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of that faith and ſelf-dedication to him, and to love unfeignedly all his diſciples, as they would be the members of Chriſt's church or kingdom:

                  <p>And accordingly we find that, purſuant to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which our Lord gave to the apoſtles, <hi>ſaying, As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> (which, by the way, ſhews the extent of the apoſtolic commiſſion) they went forth to different parts to eſtabliſh the kingdom of the Meſſiah, and to preach the goſpel to all, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether Barbarian, Scythian, bond or free. Thus St. Andrew principally preached the goſpel

                  <p>It may here be proper, though it may ſeem a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, to take notice of the peculiar as well as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural qualifications of the apoſtles to their ſpecial of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and dignity; for beſides their extraordinary call and commiſſion, of which we have already taken notice, theſe were more eſpecially ſtiled the ambaſſadors of God to men, for which they were qualified by the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſpiritual gifts, and of miraculous powers. They had, indeed, ſeen our Lord, and were ſufficiently qualified to be witneſſes of the truth and reality of his reſurrection from the dead, upon which grand fact they were to found the evidence of the Chriſtian doctrines, which they had, in great meaſure, learnt from him, as eye and ear witneſſes of his doctrines, life, and miracles. But beſides this, they had the effuſion of the ſpirit, whereby they were qualified to preach the goſpel in the different parts of the world, and to work miracles in atteſtation of their miſſion and doctrine. Theſe ſpiritual gifts and powers are mentioned, 1 Cor. xii. 8, 9, 10, 28, 29, 30. To them was committed, by the ſame ſpirit, the word of wiſdom—the word of knowledge— the gift of diſcerning ſpirits

                        <p>The aſſuming power of the Romiſh church, or the pope, is in no inſtance more remarkable, than in claiming the power of abſolution and indulgences, founded on thoſe words, John xx. 23. <hi>Whoſe ſins ſoever ye remit, they are remitted, and whoſe ſins ſo ever ye retain, they are retained,</hi> addreſſed to the apoſtles; but evidently relate to, and muſt be underſtood of, ſuch conditions whereon God hath promiſed pardon. And the form of abſolution, made uſe of in the three firſt centuries, was this—<hi>Almighty God, be merciful unto thee, and forgive thee thy ſins</hi>

And in the Greek church, this prayer of Damaſcen is ſtill cited: "O Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our God, who hath power to forgive ſins, in thy goodneſs and loving-kindneſs paſs by all offences of thy ſervants; for thou art the God of mercies, and able to forgive ſins."—In this ſenſe, the office of the prieſt is to declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent, the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and remiſſion of their ſins; and, ſurely, what they are to declare and pronounce, muſt actually be done before they can really declare and pronounce it to be done.</p>
                        <p>Here it is objected, that, if this be the import of the words, and they were ſpoken to the apoſtles in that ſenſe, that they cannot, in the ſame ſenſe, belong to any of their ſucceſſors, Why do we, in our ordination, retain this form of words? "Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt; whoſe ſoever ſins ye remit, thay are remitted, and whoſe ſins ſoever ye retain, they are retained."—No more is intended by it than this: "Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt for the office of a biſhop, or receive ye the Holy Ghoſt for the office of a preſbyter, declaring the remiſſion of ſins upon the terms of the goſpel."

The ſenſe, therefore, of the proteſtant church, ſtands evidently oppoſed to the claims of the Romiſh church; though it were much to be wiſhed, that the compilers of the offices of ordination had been more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit with reſpect to the true ſcriptural and rational ſenſe, in which they were therein appointed to be uſed.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0010800101:141"/>—the gift of tongues—the gift of interpretation of tongues, and the gift of fortitude is generally reckoned with the former. By theſe, and the like ſupernatural gifts, with which they were indued, by the effuſion of the ſpirit, on the day of Pentecoſt, or communicated to them ſometimes inſtantaneouſly, they were enabled to give ſuch proofs of their miſſion and doctrine, as might tend to the furtherance of the goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Thus St. Peter and St. John cured a man who was forty years old, and had been lame from his birth, Acts ii.4. And St. Peter raiſed Dorcas from the dead, and St. Paul raiſed Eutychus, which power did not extend to other apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>And we no where find, that this power was inherent in, or capable of being wantonly exerted by them; but abſolutely dependent on the power and pleaſure of the Supreme Giver.</p>

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0010800101:142"/>It is likewiſe obſervable that, though purſuant to our Lord's promiſe, infinite wiſdom ſaw fit to add ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural qualifications, for the great ends and purpoſes of their office, beſides the privilege of being cotemporaries with Chriſt, and learning from him the great doctrines and duties of the Chriſtian religion; yet our Lord cautions his apoſtles againſt an abſolute dependence on ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary communications. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I ſend you forth as ſheep among wolves; be ye therefore wiſe as ſerpents and harmleſs as doves,</hi> intimating that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their ſpecial call and commiſſion, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary aſſiſtance they ſhould receive, they were, nevertheleſs, to remember they were dependent on the divine energies, and had no claim to infallibility, as they were men, and ſhould therefore conduct themſelves with care, prudence, and circumſpection.</p>
                  <p>One of the moſt diſtinguiſhing miraculous powers communicated to the apoſtles, was the ability of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring on others ſome ſpiritual gifts; and it has been often aſſerted, that they did this to ſome of the adult converts wherever they came; though what particular gifts or powers thoſe converts ſhould receive, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their prayer and impoſition of their hands, was not ſolely at their choice, but dependent on the will and direction of the Divine Spirit, who knew beſt what was proper, both for particular perſons, and for the common intereſt of Chriſtianity
<note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. Benſon of the Propagation of Chriſtianity.</note>. This extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manifeſtation of the ſpirit, which attended the public miniſtration of the goſpel, is ſometimes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a plenteous and viſible effuſion of the divine ſpirit

                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0010800101:146"/>The general doctrine of the church of Rome is, that Peter was not only appointed by our Saviour the chief of the apoſtles; but that he was conſtituted the firſt biſhop of Rome, and head of the univerſal church, and that after having been ſeven years biſhop of Antioch, he was, in the modern phraſe, tranſlated to Rome, and continued to be biſhop there twenty-five years, and then ſuffered martyrdom under the emperor Nero. A. D. 64, according to Blair, 68; according to Whiſton.</p>
                     <p>But it is not certain which of the apoſtles firſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goſpel at Rome; ſome aſſert, that St. Peter came to Rome only occaſionally to viſit that church, and was, by order of the Emperor Nero, crucified with St. Paul, who was charged with having made many proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes to Chriſtianity there.</p>
                     <p>But that Peter never was biſhop of Rome, is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by many credible hiſtorians and divines
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>The Papiſts indeed ſay, that St. Peter was the firſt named an apoſtle by Chriſt to begin the goſpel church, that he wrought the firſt miracle after Chriſt's aſcenſion, and preached the firſt ſermon, and that this apoſtle received the firſt commiſſion to begin the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Chriſtian church, &amp;c. but this is by no means a proof of his being biſhop of Rome. Firſt, from the ſilence of St. Luke, who records many things concerning Peter: he write<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> of his journey to Lydda, Joppa, Caeſarea, Jeruſalem, and Antioch; but not one word of his going to Rome to ſound the papal chair.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, When the apoſtle Paul, in his epiſtle to the Romans, ſalutes the Chriſtians and his fellow-labourers by name, he ſays not one word of Peter; and when even commending the faith of the Church, he never mentions one word of the ſuppoſed founder of it.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, St. Peter himſelf ſpeaks not one word of what the Papiſts aſſert or alledge in this matter. If he had founded the Roman church, why does he no where mention it? why does he, when writing to the diſperſed Jews, no where aſſert his claim and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive?</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, The aſſertion of his being biſhop of Rome twenty-five years, is inconſiſtent with the ſacred chronology of thoſe times; for from the time of Chriſt's death, which was in the 18th year of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius, to the 13th year of Nero, when Peter was crucified, was only thirty-ſix years, viz. five in Tiberius's reign, four in Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula's, fourteen in Claudius's, and thirteen in Nero's. Now Peter did not go out of Judea till twelve years after our Lord's death; then he was caſt into priſon by Herod, Acts, c. xii. which was the fourth year of the Emperor Claudius, and the laſt of King Agrippa; ſix years after that, or the eighteenth year after Chriſt's crucifixion, we find him preſent at a ſynod at Jeruſalem, Acts xv. and according to the catholic church, he was ſeven years at Antioch; ſo there remains only eleven years in which he could poſſibly be at Rome, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no evidence of his ever being there in that capacity.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, Peter being an apoſtle of the circumciſion, Gal. ii. 7, 8. we have reaſon to believe, that when Paul was carried to Rome, Peter viſited the Jews, who were diſperſed in Greece, Thracia, the Leſſer Aſia, Babylon, and the Eaſt, and reaped a good harveſt amongſt them, till he went to viſit the church of Rome near the cloſe of his life. When therefore the apoſtle, 1 Peter, v. 13. ſays, <hi>The church that is at Babylon ſaluteth you,</hi> he plainly writes of Babylon in the eaſt, once the head of the Aſſyrian empire, where there was ſo great a concourſe of Jews: and if it be granted that Peter had been at Rome, or reſided there ſome time, or ſuffered martyrdom there, this is no reaſon for aſſerting his primacy or epiſcopacy in that city more than at Joppa, Antioch, or Babylon.</p>

The word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a dwelling one by another; thus, according to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius, lib. iv. c. xv. p. 228. the church of Smyrna writ to the church that pariſhed in Philomelium; and the epiſtle of Clemens Romanus is, to the church of God pariſhing at Corinth.

                     <p>Thus we have not only taken a view of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Chriſtian church, as it was laid by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, but likewiſe of the peculiar qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, duty, and buſineſs of the apoſtles, for propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel and eſtabliſhing Chriſtian churches throughout the world, in the firſt century of the Chriſtian church; and hitherto the apoſtles, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their dignity, did not pretend to infallibility, did not aſſume authority over the conſciences of their fellow Chriſtians, but gave many inſtances of their zeal, diligence, and faithfulneſs; the more venerable and praiſe-worthy, as it was always accompanied with modeſty and humility. As the apoſtles received this commiſſion from Chriſt, they were bound to confine
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0010800101:156"/>themſelves wholely to it, and not to exceed the limits of it: they were his ſervants who ſent them, and the meſſage they received from him, that, and that only, were they to deliver to the world. Thus St. Paul ſays of himſelf, that <hi>God had committed to him the word of reconciliation,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 20. <hi>and that he was an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador for Chriſt, that he preached not himſelf, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and himſelf the ſervant of others for Jeſus ſake; that he had no dominion over others faith,</hi> 2 Cor. i. 24. no power to impoſe upon them arbitrary things or articles of faith, which he had not received from Chriſt; and that this was the principal matter of his comfort, that <hi>he had not ſhunned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> all the council of God. Acts xx. 27.</p>
                     <p>The apoſtles recommends a free and impartial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after truth, and enjoins it on his fellow Chriſtians to ſearch the ſcriptures; and it is evident, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome paſſages of the evangeliſts with their epiſtles, that the canon of the books of the Old Teſtament was aſcertained by them

                     <p>Indeed we have no full and certain account of the doctrine taught by Chriſt and his apoſtles, but from the records of the New Teſtament;

                     <p>The diſcipline they obſerved was no other than the execution of thoſe laws preſcribed by the apoſtles, for the correction and prevention of ſuch offences as were incident to the members of the church of Chriſt, in which great regard was had to the nature of the offence, and, except in the moſt criminal inſtances, was always exerciſed with much lenity and gentleneſs, in the conſciouſneſs of their own imperfection and liability to err.</p>
                     <p>It is indeed obſervable, that notwithſtanding the ſimplicity of doctrines, worſhip, and ceremonies, that was preſerved in the apoſtolic age, there were ſome different apprehenſions amongſt the Jewiſh proſelytes to Chriſtianity, touching ſome of the Jewiſh rites; and, for the ſake of truth and peace, we find the apoſtles thought it requiſite to conſult together, and accordingly aſſembled at Jeruſalem, A.

                     <p>There is no mention made in the New Teſtament, nor any other authentic proof in this century, that any council was called to compile canons for the order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or creeds and ſummaries of ſaith, for uniformity of ſentiments in the Chriſtian churches. Decrees of this kind much better ſuit with the ambition and authority aſſumed by ſome eccleſiaſtics in later time: though I am ſenſible a work of this kind has long ſince made its appearance in the world under that ſpecious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>This book is ſaid to be compiled by Clement, biſhop of Rome, who was choſen to that office in the year 67, and died in 88: it is entitled Apoſtolical Conſtitutions, digeſted in eight books; conſiſting of 70 canons relating to the laity, and 85 with reſpect to the dignity, office, and duty of eccleſiaſtics: and the late Rev. and learned Mr. Whiſton has, with much pains, endeavoured to eſtabliſh their authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity; in which he has likewiſe pointed out the order and method of the ſeveral matters therein contained, reſpecting doctrine, worſhip, diſcipline, and manners; in which is likewiſe inſerted the canon of ſcripture, approved and recommended by the apoſtles, which were extant before the year 63, together with the Baptiſmal Creed, and one other formulary or creed, chiefly calculated to promote the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Arius with regard to the ſubordination of the Son to the Father.</p>
                           <p>Then follows an Eſſay on the Apoſtolical Conſtitutions, wherein our author endeavours to ſhew their conſiſtency with the doctrines taught by Chriſt and his apoſtles; quotes a variety of teſtimonies from the fathers and hiſtorians of ſeveral ſucceeding centuries, in proof of ſome or other of thoſe conſtitutions, or whoſe ſentiments coincided with them. That they are of great antiquity, will not be denied; but that they have no juſt claim to the authority contended for, will, I preſume, be readily admitted by any one who compares the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of them with the doctrines contained in the New Teſtament.</p>
                           <p>For beſides the entire ſilence of the New Teſtament concerning them, which, to me, is no ſmall proof that they are ſpurious, ſeveral of thoſe canons carry with them apparent marks of mere modern in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. The dignity and power of the clergy is here, like the hierarchy of the church of Rome, ſtretched to ſuch an exorbitant height, as could hardly be conſiſtent with Chriſtian liberty, or with the ſafety of Chriſtians, eſpecially under heathen governors.—To them was to be committed the care of the eccleſiaſtical revenue, for which they were accountable to none but God.—Moreover, the titles given the prieſts, in ſome places, are impious: they are not only ſtiled prophets, rulers, kings, and governors, but alſo mediators between God and his faithful people, and in chap. xxvi. and chap. xxix. ſtiled gods.— They mention the uſing holy oil for anointing the candidates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and of ointments for ſealing them after, baptiſm—of uſing water with the wine in the Lord's ſupper.—They recommend pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary fines for ſin, prayers, or offerings and feſtivals for the dead— eſteem and honour for the reliques of ſaints, and other ceremonies equally ſuperſtitious and unſcriptural: for which me muſt refer the reader to Mr. Whiſton's Primitive Chriſtianity Revived, book iii. to which is added his defence.</p>
                           <p>But ſo incongruous did the general tenour of them appear to the New Teſtament, and ſo unſatisfactory his defence, that they were cenſured by the convocation at Canterbury, A. D. 1711. The form of which is as follows:</p>
                           <p>Whereas the ſaid William Whiſton, the better to ſupport his heretical opinions, ſpeaking of a book commonly called the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolical Conſtitutions, hath theſe words: "I have, I think, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly found, that thoſe Apoſtolical Conſtitutions, which the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian church hath ſo long laid aſide as ſpurious and heretical, are no other than the original laws and doctrines of the goſpel, the new covenant, or moſt ſacred ſtandard of Chriſtianity, equal in their authority to the four goſpels themſelves, and ſuperior in authority to the epiſtles of ſingle apoſtles; ſome parts of them being our Saviour's own original laws, delivered to the apoſtles; and the other parts the public acts of the apoſtles themſelves, met in council at Ceſarea and Jeruſalem, a little before their death; and that this was the conſtant opinion and teſtimony of the earlieſt ages of the goſpel:" We cannot but declare theſe aſſertions concerning a book, <hi>which was never yet acknowledged as part of the canon of ſcripture by any general council, nor received as ſuch in any Chriſtian church,</hi> to be highly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and impious, tending to create in the minds of Chriſtians great uncertainties, as to their rule of faith, and to ſubvert that faith which was once delivered to the ſaints, and which is preſerved in the books of the New Teſtament, received in our church.</p>

The Chriſtians of Aſia the Leſs kept it on the 14 day after the firſt new moon that followed the vernal equinox, on what day ſoever it happened. On the contrary, the churches of Rome, France, Corinth, &amp;c. held, that Eaſter day ought always to be on a Sunday. Victor, who could not eaſily decide the controverſy, without more a-do excommunicated all the Chriſtian churches of Aſia—at leaſt ſo far as to withdraw from, and refuſe communion, with the Aſiatic churches on that account, according to Euſebius, to whom we refer the reader.</p>

<note n="§" place="bottom">Having mentioned the apoſtles creed, it may be proper to give a general account thereof. The learned author of the Critical Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of this creed very juſtly acknowledges, that this creed was not the work of one man, or of a day, (he might have ſaid, nor of one century). The ancient fathers never indeed called it by the name of the apoſtles creed, but ſay it was agreeable to what they taught. Moſt of the articles are indiſputably ſo; ſome of them are ſaid to be derived from Philip's requiring of the eunuch a profeſſion of his faith in Chriſt, as the Son of God, as a pre-requiſite to his being baptized: and, for a conſiderable time, the chriſtian biſhops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with ſome ſuch general form of words, without any particular explication of the nature and action of God, or the ſtate of the Son. The reaſon of the additional articles ſeems to be this: not long after the apoſtles time, ſeveral hereſies ſprung up in the church, ſubſerſive of the fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and even of all religion. Thus the firſt article, <hi>I believe in God the Father,</hi> was introduced in oppoſition to the Manichaeans, who aſſerted two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent deities, A. D. 276. The word Almighty was alſo added to this article, againſt ſome Manichaeans, who aſſerted, that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, were but one perſon. The ſecond article, <hi>and in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> was introduced about the ſame time, in oppoſition to Sabellianiſm, who made the Son and Holy Spirit to be only virtues or emanations of the deity. The words, <hi>he deſcended into hell,</hi> were neither in the Roman nor oriental creeds. The phraſe, <hi>communion of ſaints,</hi> was not in any creed till above 400 years after Chriſt, and then not immediately received in all. The clauſe of <hi>life everlaſting</hi> was omitted in ſeveral; and whoever ſhall compare the Grecian or the French creed, recorded by Iraeneus, thoſe of Carthage cited by Tertullian, that of Aquila, Hippo, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna, or Turin, will find them all to vary; which, with other conſiderations, ſufficiently evidence the apoſtles could not be the authors of the creed that paſſes in their name

                  <p>In the third century the biſhops exalted themſelves highly above other paſtors, and drew many dangerous conſequences from the doctrine of one catholic church. Some biſhops even claimed a ſuperiority to others, but

                  <p>Sir Peter King gives us the following account of the worſhip and ceremonies of the primitive church, viz. that they began their ſervice with reading the ſcriptures. Then every one ſang a hymn or pſalm out of the Bible, or of their own compoſing—that they ſometimes ſang alternately, and ſometimes conjointly. Then began their ſermon by way of expoſition of the leſſon and exhortation, generally by the biſhop of the pariſh. Afterwards all the congregation roſe up to prayers, which were offered through Chriſt. They uſed the Lord's prayer at the beginning of their devotions; yet they did not uſe that only, but ſuch other ſupplications to God, as the variety of their circumſtances required. They uſually prayed ſtanding with their hands and eyes lifted up to heaven, the miniſter exerciſing his gifts in ſuitable matter and apt expreſſion. Baptiſm,

                  <p>The fourth century furniſhes us with many tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of an intereſting nature. Though hitherto Chriſtianity appears to have been propagated with tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſimplicity, and the Chriſtian church retained much of its primeval purity, eſpecially with reſpect to manners, and in a great regard for the ſcriptures, the canon of which was ſettled about this time; and by theſe means the darkneſs of paganiſm was in a good meaſure baniſhed from a great part of the known world. We are nevertheleſs informed, that "ſoon after, the Chriſtian world fell into endleſs ſchiſms and contentions, and had deſtroyed, in great meaſure, that peace, love and charity, which the goſpel was intended to promote; and, inſtead thereof, provoked one another to malice.

After the Roman empire became Chriſtian it was greatly corrupted, till the empire fell, and made way for the dominion and grandeur of the biſhop of Rome, under whom the corruption aroſe to an amazing height, and true Chriſtianity was almoſt loſt for ſeveral ages
<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Benſon's Hiſtory of the firſt planting of Chriſtianity, p. 6.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Early in this century, in which the fathers Cyril, Baſil, Gregory, and Ambroſe, flouriſhed, was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the monaſtic life; but, notwithſtanding this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and the pretence of ſanctity to countenance it, the love of power and riches appears from the conſequences to be predominant, or that it was at beſt founded in ſuperſtition.</p>
                  <p>From this time the church became modelled by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming prieſts; the divines attempted to explain the myſteries of religion by the rules of logic, and impoſing articles of faith by authority, rather than convincing by argument.</p>
                  <p>In this century, the popes of Rome laid the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of that monarchical power and grandeur to which they afterwards roſe.</p>
                  <p>One of the firſt and moſt eſſential ſteps was the erection of the dignity of patriarch, afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Nicene council; and thus the hierarchy or government of the church became modelled; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtitution of the Roman empire. This being the deſign of their meaſures, another funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principle was added to it, viz. that the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and authority of biſhops over others, ſhould be determined by the rank of the cities where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided; and of conſequence, in proceſs of time, as it could be effected, the biſhop of Rome muſt have the ſupremacy; and this was managed with ſo much art, as to be confirmed in the next council, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to have previouſly made a point of it

                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0010800101:174"/>Conſtantine, who, for his gallant acts, was ſurnamed the Great, was the firſt emperor that declared himſelf a Chriſtian, A. D. 312, and conſtituted the croſs his banner: he reſtored peace and tranquillity to the Chriſtians, he built many noble churches and oratories, wherein he ſuffered no Gentile altars or images to be placed, nor any heatheniſh feſtivals to be ſolemnized
<note n="§" place="bottom">See Spanhemius and the Theodoſian Cedex.</note>. He alſo wrote a large pathetic epiſtle to the provincial governors of the eaſt; where, with great wiſdom and piety, he exhorts all his ſubjects to embrace Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: but, when he had uſed many gentle methods to reclaim the Gentile world, he proceeded by more ſevere methods to quell the pagan idolatry; unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their temples, and expoſed their idols; and at the ſame time took great care, that biſhops or paſtors were ſettled every where in the Chriſtian churches. Though this great prince was not baptiſed till a little before his death, which was May 22, A. D. 338.'</p>
                  <p>But when the church, under Conſtantine and his ſucceſſors, enjoyed the protection of the civil powers, the Chriſtians compared their preſent with their paſt condition, and called to mind the ſufferings of their predeceſſors, and the patience and fortitude which they had exerted, particularly in the laſt and ſevereſt perſecution. Theſe conſiderations raiſed in them an high, and indeed, in ſome meaſure, a juſt veneration for the martyrs. But it did not ſtop here, it ran into exceſs, and produced bad effects. Every rumour concerning the behaviour of thoſe ſaints was received without examination, and repreſented as meritorious, inſomuch that certain monks found their account in going about, under the pretence of ſelling their bones and reliques.</p>
                  <p>The fathers of thoſe times, as Athanaſius, Gregory, Nazianzen, but particularly Chryſoſtom, with his popular eloquence, contributed to the utmoſt of their power to encourage the ſuperſtitious veneration and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0010800101:175"/>invocation of ſaints, the love of monkery, and the belief of miracles, wrought by monks and reliques. Some of thoſe fathers, particularly Gregory, were in other reſpects valuable men: but this was the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of thoſe times, and they were not free from it
<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Chryſoſtom, l. i. Orat. xl. p. 485.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Thence aroſe religious addreſſes to the martyrs, who were conſidered as patrons and interceſſors, which tended to leſſen the reliance and gratitude due to Chriſt, and to ſubſtitute new expedients in the room of rational piety and ſtrict morality.</p>
                  <p>Some inſtances during Conſtantine's reign are an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable proof where the government of the church was veſted, and how the biſhops of Rome were eſteemed as to their authority in thoſe days.</p>
                  <p>When Donatus ſtood condemned as a heretic by the churches of Afric, Conſtantine left him not to be judged by the biſhop of Rome, at that time Miltiades, but appointed the biſhops of Colen, Anthun, and Arles, to hear his cauſe; who not agreeing, he joined with them the ſaid Miltiades; and after that, upon an appeal from their order, the emperor heard and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it himſelf, pronouncing the biſhop of Carthage innocent, and his adverſaries deſerving cenſure

                  <p>The ſentiments of Arius, commonly called the Arian hereſy, (which we have before explained) began to prevail. Alexander, biſhop of Alexandria, oppoſed himſelf againſt him, and ſent epiſtles to all the churches, and among the reſt to Rome; but, without waiting for advice from them, excommunicated Arius. This kindling a great fire, Conſtantine was applied to, and the famous council of Nice was aſſembled by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate command or precept of Conſtantine; and by this and other inſtances it appears by whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority councils were convened, at that time, and for ſome hundreds of years afterwards, but, if you aſk Bellarmine, he ſays only by the pope,

When this council was called by the ſole order of Conſtantine, he alſo ſat amongſt them as preſident; the biſhop of Rome was not there, but ſent two depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſtiled preſbyters. But ſo far was he, by his depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, chief there, that the firſt biſhop, who opened the matter and gave his opinion, was Euſtathius biſhop of Antioch; and in the ſixth canon of that council for ranking and ordering of biſhops in their places, no mention is made of the pre-eminence of Rome to any other city, but this general phraſe uſed, <hi>That every church ſhall retain her due honour</hi>

                  <p>The number of biſhops in this council were 318, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides vaſt numbers of preſbyters, deacons, acolothiſts, &amp;c. Euſebius tells us, that ſome came to the council with worldly views of gain; and Theodoret, that others were ſubtle and crafty, and of a quarrelſome, malicious temper, which appeared immediately upon the opening of the council; for, notwithſtanding the emperor was preſent, who admoniſhed them to lay aſide all their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and to enter into meaſures of union and peace, they fell to groſs reflections on each other, and raiſed great diſturbances, inſomuch that he was obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe his authority, and with much perſuaſion ſilenced them.</p>
                  <p>When the emperor had brought them to ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they fell in good earneſt to creed-making, and drew up and ſubſcribed that which, from the place where they were aſſembled, was called the Nicene
<note n="‖" place="bottom">This creed was compoſed at this firſt general council of Nice, A.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0010800101:177"/>By the accounts of the tranſactions in this aſſembly, given by Athanaſius himſelf in his letter to the African biſhops, it appears, that they were determined to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert in the creed ſuch words as were moſt obnoxious to the Arians, and thus to force them to a public ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the church
<note n="*" place="bottom">Theod. E. H. l. I. c. viii.</note>: and when thoſe of the Arian party propoſed in writing to the ſynod the form of faith they had drawn up, the biſhops of the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox ſide no ſooner read it than they gravely tore it in pieces, and called it a ſpurious and falſe confeſſion, and after they had filled the place with noiſe and confuſion, univerſally accuſed them of betraying the doctrine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to godlineſs; and when the Arians would have conſented to forms of expreſſion that were general and leaſt exceptionable, the orthodox party would admit of no other phraſes than, <hi>That the Son was conſubſtantial and of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father;</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Arians urged, that this expreſſion was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural, the orthodox would not admit of any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and all the council ſubſcribed the creed, (except five biſhops, who, beſide other objections, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the word Conſubſtantial;) and the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox even proceeded ſo far as to cut off from communion all who would not agree to, and ſubſcribe this creed. In this public manner did the biſhops aſſert a dominion over the faith and conſciences of others, and aſſumed a power not only to dictate to them what they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but even to anathematize and expel from the Chriſtian church all who refuſed to ſubmit to their deciſions, and own their authority; for after they had
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0010800101:178"/>carried their creed, they proceeded to excommunicate Arius, and his followers, and baniſhed Arius from Alexandria. They alſo condemned his book, called Thalia, which contained his explication of his own doctrine. After this they ſent letters to Alexandria, and to the brethren in Egypt, Lybia, and Pentapolis, to acquaint them with their decrees; and to inform them, that the holy ſynod had condemned the opinions of Arius, and exhort them to rejoice for the good deeds they had done, in cutting off all manner of hereſy. Conſtantine, after this, diſmiſſed the council, (not without ſome donations to gratify their avarice) recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them peace and harmony, and to avoid am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity againſt ſuch as might excel, or be inferior to them: he likewiſe wrote to ſeveral churches, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending and enjoining an univerſal conformity to the council's decrees, both in doctrine and ceremonies, uſing this, among other arguments, that what they had decreed was the will of God, and that the agreement of ſo great a number of biſhops was by inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt. But it is very natural to remark, after the anathemas and depoſitions agreed on by this council, which were the beginning of all the perſecutions that afterwards raged, with how little propriety the dignity of inſpiration was applied to them.</p>
                  <p>Many unhappy conſequences very ſoon took place; for when the Emperor's recommending to the churches a ſubmiſſion to their decrees was not effectual, more violent meaſures were made uſe of; for out of his great zeal to extinguiſh hereſy, he put forth public edicts againſt the authors and maintainers of it; againſt the Novatians, Valentinians, Marcionites, and others; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that the books written by any of them ſhould be burnt; and if any kept them in their poſſeſſion, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to counteract his edict, they ſhould, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction thereof, ſuffer death.</p>
                  <p>Thus the orthodox firſt brought in the puniſhment of hereſy with death, and perſuaded the emperor to deſtroy thoſe whom they could not eaſily convert. The
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0010800101:179"/>ſcriptures were now no longer the rule and ſtandard of the Chriſtian faith; orthodoxy and hereſy were from henceforward to be determined by the deciſions of councils and fathers, and religion to be propagated no longer by the apoſtolic methods of perſuaſion, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the virtues of an holy life, but by imperial edicts and decrees; and heretical gainſayers not to be convinced, that they may be brought to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the truth and be ſaved, but to be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and deſtroyed. It is no wonder, that after this there ſhould be a continual fluctuation of the public faith, juſt as the prevailing parties had the imperial authority to ſupport them; or that we ſhould meet with little elſe in eccleſiaſtical hiſtory but violence and cruelties, committed by men, who had left the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Chriſtian faith and profeſſion, enſlaved themſelves to ambition and avarice, and had before them the enſnaring views of tomporal grandeur, high preferments, and large revenues.</p>
                  <p>If one reads the complaints of the orthodox writers againſt the Arians, one would think the Arians the moſt execrable ſet of men that ever lived: but Socrates tells us, this was the practice of the biſhops towards all they depoſed, to accuſe and pronounce them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, but not to tell others the reaſons why they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed them as ſuch
<note n="‡" place="bottom">E. H. l. 1. c. xiv.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Soon after theſe tranſactions, Arius died; and the manner of his death, as it was reported by the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, Athanaſius thinks of itſelf ſufficient, fully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Arian hereſy, and an evident proof that it was hateful to God. The Chriſtians, however, being bleſſed with Chriſtian emperors, were of opinion, that the divine providence had, in a ſignal manner, raiſed up and protected Conſtantine, for deſtroying the enemies of the church; but there is uſually much of raſhneſs and preſumption, in ſuppoſing the calamities of finners in this world are particular judgements of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0010800101:180"/>God. Nor did Conſtantine himſelf long ſurvive him. He was ſucceeded by his three ſons, Conſtantine, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius, and Conſtans. Conſtantine, the eldeſt, recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Athanaſius from baniſhment, and reſtored him to his biſhopric; upon which account there aroſe moſt grievous quarrels and ſeditions, many being killed, and ſeveral publicly whipped, by Athanaſius's order, according to the accuſations of his enemies. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius, after his elder brother's death, convened a ſynod at Antioch in Syria, where Athanaſius was again depoſed for theſe crimes, and Gregory put into the ſee of Alexandria. In this council a new creed was drawn up, in which the word <hi>Conſubſtantial</hi> was wholely omitted, and the expreſſions made uſe of ſo general, as that they might have been equally agreed to by the orthodox and Arians. In the cloſe of it ſeveral anathema's were added, and particularly upon all who ſhould teach, or preach, otherwiſe than what this council had received, becauſe, as they themſelves ſay, <hi>They did really believe and follow all things delivered by the holy ſcriptures, both prophets and apoſtles.</hi> So that now the whole Chriſtian world was under a ſynodical curſe, the oppoſite councils having damned one another, and all that differed from them; and if councils, as ſuch, have any authority to anathematize all who will not ſubmit to them, this authority equally belongs to every council; and therefore it was but a natural piece of revenge, that as the council of Nice had ſent all the Arians to the devil, the Arians, in their turn, ſhould take the orthodox along with them for company, and thus repay one anathema with another.</p>
                  <p>Conſtantius II. was warmly on the Arian ſide, and favoured the biſhops of that party only, and ejected Paul, the orthodox biſhop, from the ſee of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, as a perſon altogether unworthy of it. Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius being ſubſtituted in his room, who was in a different ſcheme, or at leaſt expreſſed himſelf in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent words, both from the orthodox and Arians, aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Son was not conſubſtantial, not of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0010800101:181"/>ſame, but of a like ſubſtance with the Father, and openly propogated this opinion after he had thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the biſhopric of Paul; this the orthodox party highly reſented, and perſecuted thoſe who favoured that opinion.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, that the Chriſtian clergy were now become the chief incendiaries and diſturbers of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and the pride of the biſhops, and the fury of the people on each ſide, were now grown to ſuch a height, as that there ſcarce ever was an election or reſtoration of a biſhop in the larger cities, but it was attended with ſlaughter and blood, as it is evident from the accounts given by the eccleſiaſtical hiſtorians of Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius, Macedonius, and others, that they treated one another with the ſame implacable bitterneſs and ſeverity as ever their common enemies, the heathens, treated them, as though they thought that perſecution for conſcience ſake had been the diſtinguiſhing precept of the Chriſtian religion
<note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor Chandler's Hiſt. of Perſecution, p. 36.</note>.</p>
                  <p>This was the unhappy ſtate of the church in the reign of Conſtantius, which affords us little more than the hiſtory of councils and creeds differing from, and contrary to, each other; biſhops depoſing, cenſuring, and anathematiſing their adverſaries; and the Chriſtian people, divided into factions under their reſpective leaders, for the ſake of words they underſtood nothing of the ſenſe of, and ſtriving for victory, even unto bloodſhed and death.</p>
                  <p>This occaſioned much debate about the authority of councils and their liability to err in their deciſions. It was ſuggeſted, that in a council convened by a Chriſtian emperor, wherein ſome hundreds of prelates are aſſembled to deſide a theological diſpute, many are liable to be influenced by fear or dread of ſuperiors of greater juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, either of falling under their diſpleaſure of being reviled as heretics, or perhaps beggared and ruined by their refuſing to be influenced by ſome active and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0010800101:182"/>ſpirits; by a deference to the majority; by a love of applauſe and reſpect; by vanity and ambition; by a total ignorance of the queſtion in diſpute, or a total indifference about it; by private friendſhip; by enmity and reſentment; by an indolent diſpoſition; by an averſion to diſputes, or love of peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c. which whoever conſiders will be ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there is no great deference to be paid to the authority of councils. Even the authority of councils themſelves were zealouſly aſſerted by the council of Conſtance and Baſil, and condemned by the Lateran; nevertheleſs the diſpute turned in favour of councils, and it was in general deemed heretical to ſpeak againſt their authority. They who diſclaim private judgement, and believe the infallibility of the church, act conſiſtent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in holding the infallibility of councils; but they who take their faith from the ſcriptures, and not from the church, ſhould be careful not to require nor to yield too much regard to ſuch aſſemblies
<note n="*" place="bottom">Jortin's Remark on Eccleſ. Hiſt. vol. iii. p. 55.</note>.</p>
                  <p>We have a rule, by which we may with ſafety, and with ſatisfaction, judge of their authority; a rule given us by our Maſter, <hi>By their fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> We need only ſurvey their acts and monuments, their behaviour, doctrines, decrees, and cenſures, and compare them impartially with the morality, the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, the prudence, the charity of the goſpel; and by this we may judge of the authority of councils and fathers.</p>
                  <p>The forming of creeds or ſummary accounts of the Chriſtian faith, till this century, were but few, and thoſe conciſe, expreſſive only of the principal articles, and thoſe not impoſed on the churches; but in proceſs of time, when the empire became Chriſtian, and the deciſions of aſſembled biſhops were made under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the court, and then enforced by the ſecular arm, the creeds they drew up were no longer mere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the principal doctrines for preſerving a unity of faith, &amp;c. but obtained the nature of decrees and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0010800101:183"/>laws, henceforth precluding all private judgement, and under one ſhape or other binding the main body of the clergy, if not the whole Chriſtian world. And indeed, what St. Gregory Nazianzen thought of the councils held in his time, that is to ſay, in the latter half of the fourth century, appears ſufficiently from his letter to Procopius—that he never ſaw a good ending of any ſynod—the ſpirit of contention, or the ſpirit of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and love of rule, ſtill gaining the aſcendancy over reaſon: nor does he except that council to which we are ſo far indebted for the Nicene creed, and at which he himſelf, to his ſorrow, was preſent. They fall, ſaith he, into factions, and fight for the ſake of thrones, i. e. of epiſcopal fees, and divide the whole world in a lawleſs or irreligious manner

                  <p>In the beginning of Julian's reign, A. D. 361. he behaved himſelf with great moderation towards the Chriſtians; yet his hatred to them ſoon afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo, that they were not permitted the education of their children, nor to be inſtructed in the Grecian lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and learning. He taxed them very heavily, and exacted fines from ſuch as would not ſacrifice; and when the governors of the provinces took occaſion, from thence, to increaſe the oppreſſion, inſomuch that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ranks could not but complain of their cruelty, Julian anſwered, with a ſneer, Your God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you to ſuffer perſecution. And one of the reaſons aſſigned for his ſeverity was, that the Chriſtian biſhops ſhewed ſuch a turbulent ſpirit, that he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to have a jealous eye over them, and bear a ſtrict hand toward them.

                  <p>Jovian ſucceeded him, who was a Chriſtian both by principle and profeſſion. But the biſhops were ſoon for tampering with him: Athanaſius writes to him in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Nicene creed, and endeavoured to prevail
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0010800101:184"/>upon him to perſecute the Arians. A ſynod alſo of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain biſhops met at Antioch, who, though they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oppoſed the Nicene doctrine, finding that Jovian favoured it, with great obſequiouſneſs readily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it, and in a very complaiſant letter repreſented that this true orthodox faith was the center of unity, while the followers of Macedonius, who rejected the word Conſubſtantial, ſought to recommend themſelves to his favour by the beſt repreſentation they could give of their tenets. Jovian, who ſaw through the craft of thoſe temporiſing biſhops, anſwers, "I hate contention, and love thoſe that ſtudy for peace;" declaring, he would trouble none on account of their faith, but would favour and eſteem thoſe who contributed to reſtore and preſerve peace in the church.

                  <p>Valentinian and Valens, who ſucceeded him, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced different parties in religion: the former, of the orthodox ſide, the latter, of the Arians. However, they both declared for liberty; but Valens ſoon ſuffered himſelf to be prevailed upon, by Eudoxus, biſhop of Conſtantinople, to forſake both his opinion and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. They obtained leave from him to hold a ſynod at Lampſacus, where the orthodox carried their point, and depoſed all the biſhops of the Arian party
<note n="†" place="bottom">Sozimus, lib. vi. c. vii.</note>. This was ſo contrary to the moderation of Valens, that he was highly exaſperated, who thereupon called a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Arian biſhops, and commanded thoſe, who formed the council of Lampſacus, to embrace the opinions of Eudoxus the Arian, and upon their refuſal ſent them into baniſhment, and gave their churches to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſparing only Paulinus for the remarkable ſanctity

                  <p>In the mean time great diſturbances happened at Rome upon Liberius's dying, who was biſhop of that city. Urſinus, a Dean of that church, and Damaſus, were nominated to ſucceed him; the party of Damaſus prevailed, and got him choſen and ordained: Urſinus being enraged at it ſet up a ſeparate meeting, got him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ordained by ſome other biſhops; and this occaſioned great diſputes among the citizens for the epiſcopal dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the matter was carried to ſuch a height, that great numbers were murdered in the quarrel on both ſides, no leſs than 137 perſons being deſtroyed in the church itſelf, according to Ammianus
<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. xxvii. c. iii.</note>, who adds, "That it was no wonder to ſee thoſe, who were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of human greatneſs, contending with ſo much heat and animoſity for that, becauſe, when they had obtained it, they were ſure to be enriched by the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the matrons; of appearing abroad in great ſplendor; of being admired for their coſtly coaches; ſumptuous in their feaſts, outdoing ſovereign princes in the expences of their tables, &amp;c." This is ſaid to be the firſt quarrel for the ſee of Rome, A. D. 366.</p>
                  <p>Gratian, who ſucceeded Valens, was of the orthodox party, and recalled thoſe biſhops he had baniſhed, and particularly favoured and promoted the orthodox faith.</p>
                  <p>Theodoſius, who ſucceeded him, was a zealous abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the orthodox party, and wrote a letter from Theſſalonica to Conſtantinople, wherein he tells them that it was his pleaſure that all his ſubjects ſhould worſhip the Trinity as equal in divine honour: and where he could not perſuade, he endeavoured to compel the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to aſſent to, and declare their faith in the Nicene creed, under the threats of expulſion frem their churches: and the more effectually to extinguiſh the hereſy, he ſummoned a council of biſhops, in A.

                  <p>Arcadius and Honorius, who were the ſons and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of Theodoſius, embraced the orthodox religion and party, and confirmed the decrees of the former emperor.

                  <p>Thus we find the Arian doctrine was alternately (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſpoſition of the court) approved and condemned by many different councils.

                  <p>In the fifth century we find the church of Rome made very conſiderable efforts to enlarge her power. Till about the year 432 the hiſtory of the popes was merely eccleſiaſtical, but from hence the affairs of the church were ſo interwoven with thoſe of the ſtate, that their hiſtory is both eccleſiaſtical and civil. The popes ſoon made a different figure from that which they had hitherto made: no longer mere biſhops, but biſhops and princes, and the biſhop almoſt entirely loſt in the prince; no longer contending only with their collegues for ſpiritual power and juriſdiction, but at the ſame time with the greateſt monarchs for dominion; nay, employing the ſword as well as the keys, and heading, as directed by their ambition or intereſt, both councils and armies

                  <p>During theſe tranſactions, Neſtorius the perſecuted biſhop of Conſtantinople, though tolerably ſound in the doctrine of the real Deity of the Logos, yet excepted againſt the Virgin Mary being called the Mother of God. This occaſioned a council to be convened at Epheſus, A. D. 434, of which Cyril was preſident,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0010800101:190"/>and, as he hated Neſtorius, he perſuaded the biſhops of his party to decree, that the Virgin was, and ſhould be the Mother, and to anathematize all who ſhould not confeſs her in this character.</p>
                  <p>Marcian, the ſucceſſor of Theodoſius in the empire, embraced the orthodox party and opinions, and was very deſirous to bring about an entire uniformity in the worſhip of God.

Marcian conſented, and ordered the biſhops to meet firſt at Nice, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at Chalcedon. This was the fourth general council, A. D. 454, conſiſting of near 600 prelates: the principal cauſe of their aſſembling was the Eutychian hereſy, viz. That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt conſiſted of two natures he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his incarnation, but that after this he had one nature only: he alſo denied that the body of Chriſt was of the ſame ſubſtance with ours.</hi> This council condemned his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as heretical, and expelled him from the biſhopric of Alexandria, and proceeded to ſettle the faith accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Nicene creed, the opinions of the fathers, and the doctrine of Athanaſius, Cyril, Celeſtine, Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Baſil, Gregory, and Leo; and decreed that Chriſt was truly God and truly man, conſubſtantial to the Father as to his deity, and conſubſtantial to us as to his humanity; and that it ſhould not be lawful for any perſons to utter or write, or compoſe, or think, or teach, any other faith whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Leo ſucceeded Marcian, and zealouſly endeavoured to promote the orthodox faith.—But, under Zeno, the ſon-in-law and ſucceſſor to Leo, notwithſtanding his uniting and pacifying edict, great differences aroſe, and perſecutions were commenced againſt the orthodox.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0010800101:191"/>Anaſtaſius, who ſucceeded Zeno, was himſelf a great lover of peace, and endeavoured to promote it both amongſt the clergy and laity, and therefore ordered that there ſhould be no innovation in the church what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. But this moderation was by no means pleaſing to the monks and biſhops: ſome of them were great ſticklers for the council of Chalcedon, and would not allow a ſingle word of their decrees to be altered, nor communicate with thoſe who did not receive them: others were ſo far from ſubmitting to this ſynod, that they anathematized it; whilſt others adhered to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific edict, and maintained peace with one another, even though they were of different judgement concerning the nature of Chriſt. Hence the church was divided into factions, ſo that the biſhops would not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with each other: not only the Eaſtern biſhops ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Weſtern, but thoſe of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince had ſchiſms among themſelves. The emperor, to prevent as much as poſſible theſe quarrels, baniſhed thoſe who were moſt remarkably troubleſome from their ſees: but the monks and biſhops fruſtrated all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for peace, by forcing one another to make new confeſſions and ſubſcriptions, and by anathematizing all who differed from them, as heretics: they alſo treated the emperor himſelf with great inſolence, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated him as an enemy to the ſynod of Chalcedon

One of the council immediately obſerved, they were convened for that purpoſe, and he was for that end ſummoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before them.</p>
                  <p>Juſtin, who aſcended the imperial throne, A. D. 518, revived the perſecutions, as a mark of his greater zeal for orthodoxy than his predeceſſor: Anaſtaſius Severus, biſhop of Antioch, being warm againſt the council of Chalcedon, the emperor ordered his tongue to be cut out. Platina alſo tells us, that he baniſhed the Arians, and gave their churches to the orthodox. Hormiſda alſo, biſhop of Rome, after the example of Symmachus, baniſhed the remainder of the Manichees, and cauſed their writings to be burnt.</p>
                  <p>Juſtinian, his ſucceſſor, ſucceeded him alſo in his zeal for the council of Chalcedon, and baniſhed the biſhops of Conſtantinople and Antioch, becauſe they would not obey his orders.—He publiſhed a law, that there ſhould
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0010800101:195"/>be no pagan or heretic in his empire, allowing three months only for their converſion: by another, he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them incapable of being witneſſes in any trial againſt Chriſtians: he likewiſe prohibited the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing any heretical book, upon the puniſhment of loſing both their hands. Theſe laws were principally enacted at the inſtigation of the orthodox biſhops. Thus Agapetus, biſhop of Rome, who had condemned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thimus, and depoſed him from his ſee of Conſtantinople, perſuaded Juſtinian to baniſh all thoſe whom he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for hereſy. But notwithſtanding all his zeal for orthodoxy, and the cruel edicts he publiſhed for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of hereſy, he was infamouſly covetous; ſold the provinces of the empire to plunderers and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, ſtripped the wealthy of their eſtates upon falſe accuſations. Evagrius
<note n="*" place="bottom">Evagrius, lib. iv. ch. xxxii. Platina. Dr. Chandler's Hiſtory of Perſecution, p. 52.</note> likewiſe charges him with a variety of other unheard-of cruelties, and unnatural vices.</p>
                  <p>During the reign of Juſtinian, in the 24th year of it, was held the fifth general council at Conſtantinople, A. D. 553, conſiſting of about 165 fathers. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their meeting was the oppoſition that was made to the four former general councils, and particularly the writings of Origen, which Euſtochius, biſhop of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, accuſed, as full of many dangerous errors. In the firſt ſeſſions it was debated, whether <hi>thoſe, who were dead, were to be anathematized?</hi> One Eutychius looked with contempt on the fathers for their heſitation in ſo plain a matter, and told them, that there needed no deliberation about it; for that king Joſias formerly did not only deſtroy the idolatrous prieſts who were living, but dug alſo thoſe, who had been dead long before, out of their graves. So clear a determination of the point, who could reſiſt? The fathers were immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and Juſtinian cauſed him to be conſecrated biſhop of Conſtantinople, in the room of Menas, juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, for this his ſkill in ſcripture and caſuiſtry. The conſequence was, that the decrees of the four preceding
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0010800101:196"/>councils were all confirmed; thoſe who were condemned by them, re-condemned and anathematized; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Theodorus, biſhop of Mopſueſtia, and Ibas, with their writings, as favouring the impieties of Neſtorius; and finally, Origen, with all his deteſtable and execrable principles, and all perſons whatſoever, who ſhould think or ſpeak of them, or dare to defend them. After theſe tranſactions the ſynod ſent an account of them to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, whom they complimented with the title of <hi>the Moſt Chriſtian King, and with having a ſoul partaker of the heavenly nobility;</hi> and yet ſoon after theſe flatteries, his moſt chriſtian majeſty turned heretick himſelf, and endeavoured, with as much zeal, to propagate hereſy, as he had done orthodoxy before: he publiſhed an edict, by which he ordained, That <hi>the body of Chriſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, and incapable even of natural and innocent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; that before his death he eat in the ſame manner as he did after his reſurrection, receiving no converſion or change from his very formation in the womb, neither in his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or natural affections, nor after his reſurrection.</hi> But as he was endeavouring to force the biſhops to receive his creed, God was pleaſed, as Evagrius obſerves, to cut him off.</p>
                  <p>But after the year 560, the biſhops being become the abſolute diſpenſers of the fourth part of the goods of the church, they began to employ more of their care in their temporal affairs, and to make parties in the cities; ſo that elections were no longer carried on with a view to the ſervice of God, but managed by faction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, which often proceeded to open violence. This gave the firſt alarm to princes, who had hitherto little concerned themſelves in the choice of the miniſtry. Moved, therefore, partly by religious conſiderations, and partly by reaſons of ſtate, they now began not to ſuffer the clergy and people to determine elections by themſelves, and according to their own paſſions: for ſeeing men no longer avoiding and flying from biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics, but even making intereſt for them by all the courtſhip and ſkilful ſollicitations they could uſe, ſo
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0010800101:197"/>great a conteſt opened the way to ſeditions. Theſe proceedings produced an edict, that no perſon elected ſhould be conſecrated without the approbation of the prince, reſerving to themſelves the right of confirming the great biſhoprics, ſuch as thoſe in Italy, of Rome, Ravenna, and Milan. In this manner, that is, with the imperial ſanction, the popes and biſhops continued to be choſen. Through all the hiſtory of Gregory of Tours, from the time of Clowis, the firſt Chriſtian king of France, until the year 590, we find no inſtance of any one biſhop being made in any other manner, than by the nomination or conſent of the king. It was eaſy for thoſe biſhops, when once they were made without the authority of the people, to exclude the people alſo from the choice of prieſts and deacons, and other eccleſiaſtical miniſters, and to transfer that right to the emperor or prince alone: and thus the ſucceſſion of biſhops and clergy became greatly irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and, inſtead of being choſen and ſet apart to their reſpective offices by the people, whom they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to watch over and miniſter unto, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reaſon and ancient uſage, they were ſet apart by thoſe inveſted with civil power.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding this order and method was broke through in after-times by arbitrary meaſures, it appears that, ſo late as the year 590, the pope was not deemed lawful pope till his election was confirmed by the emperor: hence Gregory the Great, being choſen by a great majority, but deſirous to decline that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, wrote to the emperor Mauritius, intreating him to refuſe his conſent, that the electors might thereby be obliged to chuſe another. The perſon choſen was alſo ſtiled Elect, not Biſhop, and yielded the firſt place in the church to the arch prieſt
<note n="*" place="bottom">Bower's Hiſtory of the Popes, vol. II. p. 265.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Under Mauritius, John, biſhop of Conſtantinople, in a council held in that city, ſtiled himſelf Oecumenical Biſhop, by the conſent of the fathers there aſſembled;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0010800101:198"/>and the emperor himſelf ordered Gregory to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him in that character. Gregory abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it, and replied, that the power of binding and looſing was delivered to Peter and his ſucceſſors, and not to the biſhops of Conſtantinople; admoniſhing him to take care, that he did not provoke the anger of God againſt himſelf, by raiſing tumults in his church. This pope was the firſt who ſtiled himſelf, <hi>Servus Servorum Dei,</hi> Servant of the Servants of God; and had ſuch an abhorrence of the title of Univerſal Biſhop, that he ſaid, "I confidently affirm, than whoſoever calls himſelf Univerſal Prieſt, is the fore-runner of Antichriſt, by thus proudly exalting himſelf above others."</p>
                  <p>But however modeſt Gregory was in refuſing and condemning this arrogant title, Boniface III. thought better of the matter; and, after great ſtruggles, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with Phocas, who murdered Mauritius, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, to declare, that the ſee of the bleſſed apoſtle Peter, which is the head of all churches, ſhould be ſo called and accounted by all, and the biſhop of it Oecumenical or Univerſal Biſhop. The church of Conſtantinople had claimed this precedence and dignity, and was ſometimes favoured herein by the emperors, who declared, that the firſt ſee ought to be in that place which was the head of the empire. The Roman pontiffs, on the other hand, affirmed that Rome, of which Conſtantinople was but a colony, ought to be eſteemed the head of the empire; becauſe the Greeks themſelves, in their writings, ſtile the emperor, Roman Emperor, and the inhabitants of Conſtantinople are called Romans, and not Greeks; not to mention that Peter, the prince of the apoſtles, gave the keys of the kingdom of heaven to his ſucceſſors, the popes of Rome. On this foundation was the ſuperiority of the church of Rome, to that of all other churches, built: and Phocas, who was guilty of all villainies, was one of the fitteſt perſons that could be found to gratify Boniface in this requeſt. Boniface alſo called a council
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0010800101:199"/>at Rome, where this ſupremacy was confirmed, and by whom it was decreed, that biſhops ſhould be choſen by the clergy and people, approved by the prince of the city, and ratified by the pope with theſe words, <hi>volumus et jubemus,</hi> for this is our will and command. To reward Phocas for the grant of the primacy, he approved the murder of Mauritius, and very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably received his images, which he ſent to Rome; and, having thus wickedly poſſeſſed themſelves of this unrighteous power, the popes as wickedly uſed it, ſoon brought almoſt the whole Chriſtian world into ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, and became the perſecutors general of the church of God, proceeding from one uſurpation to another, till at laſt they brought emperors, kings, and princes, into ſubjection, forcing them to ratify their unjuſt decrees, and to puniſh, in the ſevereſt manner, all that ſhould preſume to oppoſe and contradict them, till ſhe became <hi>drunken with the blood of the ſaints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jeſus; Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth</hi>

                  <p>The cuſtom of anathematizing perſons after death was introduced from apreſumption, that all thoſe whom they anathematized, and condemned as heretics, their ſentence would be confirmed by the Supreme Being; but others more modeſtly pleaded only for its being their duty to ſhew their diſapprobation of heretics, as well dead as living.</p>
                  <p>This was one part of the conteſt called the Three Chapters, which occaſioned the meeting of ſeveral coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils in this century.

                  <p>The dignity of the clergy of all ranks was a point much inſiſted on. Pope Felix, A. D. 528, aſſerted,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0010800101:200"/>that the clergy were by divine right exempted from the power of the civil magiſtrate, and their miſconduct only cognizable by, and liable to, the cenſure of the church, and the ſynods of each dioceſe and province

                  <p>It likewiſe became a diſpute, whether a pope, who is not true (that is, rightly elected and conſtituted) can be infallible. This was occaſioned by two popes being choſen at the ſame time, viz. Boniface II. and Dioſcorus, A. D. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>CENTURY THE SEVENTH.</head>
                  <p>In this century we meet with many remarkable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences.—At the beginning of it, Mellitus, the firſt biſhop of London, in conſequence of the high dignity to which he was advanced, went to Rome, as Bede in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, to conſult with the pope concerning the affairs of the Engliſh church; on which occaſion Boniface called a council of the Italian biſhops, at which the biſhop of London attended or aſſiſted, and when it broke up, returned to London with the decrees of that court.</p>
                  <p>Pope Boniface ſhewed no ſmall zeal in propagating the Chriſtian religion in Great Britain; but, at the ſame time, he took care to introduce an undue veneration for the papal robes, for the authority and dignity of the ſovereign pontiff, and for a variety of ceremonies which defaced the ſimplicity of the goſpel. This pope's pall was firſt ſent into England to Juſtus, who, in the year 624, ſucceeded Mellitus in the ſee of Canterbury; and the number of biſhops were greatly increaſed, as well as of inferior clergy, who received their ordination from the biſhop of Canterbury, by virtue of that great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which had been delegated to him by the pope.</p>
                  <p>Another point aimed at was, to increaſe a veneration for the clergy, inſomuch that pretty early in this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0010800101:202"/>the clergy acquired a very great aſcendancy over the people, and they voluntarily imparted a conſiderable ſhare of their worldly ſubſtance, eſpecially in ſome of the capital cities, as well as Rome, which in each city made one capital ſtock; and this was not divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the poor, but was appropriated to the prieſt, and other collections were made for the poor: theſe capital ſtocks were called Patrimonies; a name not denoting any dominion or juriſdiction belonging to the Roman church, or the pope, but to ſignify the eſtate of every church, and was diſtinguiſhed from the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of private men, as we find in many places of the 12th book of the Code
<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Paul of Beneficiary Matters, p.</note>.</p>
                  <p>And to create a greater reſpect for the eſtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the church, it was uſual to annex the name of ſome favourite ſaint which that church held in great veneration; ſo the eſtates of the church of Ravenna were called the patrimony of St. Apollinare; that of Milan, the patrimony of St. Ambroſe; and the eſtates of the Roman church, the patrimony of St. Peter in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruzzo.</p>
                  <p>The bulk of eccleſiaſtical hiſtorians fix the year 606 for the title of univerſal biſhop, being conferred by way of pre-eminence on the pontiff of Rome; a dignity which had been aſſumed by the biſhop of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and by others in the laſt century, but was now confirmed to pope Boniface III. who, being elected pope, prevailed on the emperor Phocas to take the title of univerſal biſhop from the biſhop of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, and to grant it to him, and his ſucceſſors, by his abſolute decree, which paſſed for that purpoſe. His taking upon him this authority, or dignity, was thought the more extraordinary, as his immediate predeceſſor but one, and probably, the beſt and the greateſt, ſo often condemned it in any biſhop whatſoever, and rejected it with indignation, when offered to himſelf, as vain, proud, impious, blaſphemous and antichriſtian, But
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0010800101:203"/>no ſooner had they brought that eccleſiaſtical power to its higheſt pitch, than they began to extend their views, to join inſenſibly the temporal and the ſpiritual power; nor did their boundleſs ambition allow them, or the world, any reſt, till they got themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for univerſal monarchs, as well as univerſal biſhops, over all where they had any juriſdiction

                  <p>The church of Scotland were much divided in their ſentiments concerning the time of keeping Eaſter, and were with much difficulty reduced to the celebration of it according to the practice of the church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>About the year 634 commenced that grand diſpute, which made ſo much noiſe in the Eaſt, whether there were in Chriſt two operating wills, the one human, the other divine, or only one will and one operation: this occaſioned a general diſſention, and the convention of ſeveral councils, and in the fifth and laſt ſeſſion of the Lateran, A. D. 637, under the more immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of pope Honorius, it was concluded in favour of one will. But this did not terminate the diſpute.</p>
                  <p>However, about the year 646 another diſpute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervened in regard to the titles and authority of the pope, the African biſhop having addreſſed Theodore the pope in a very high ſtile, calling him father of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and the ſupreme pontiff of all biſhops: the new primate of Conſtantinople wrote to him as his brother, and concluded with ſaying, the apoſtles had all an equal ſhare of power and of honour. This diſpute ſubſided for a time, and gave place to the revival of the former.</p>
                  <p>In 649 a council was called by Martin, biſhop of Rome, concerning the two natures and two opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Chriſt, and the doctrine of one will and one operation condemned and anathematized
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. vol. iii. p. 49.</note>. The form as follows: — "I Martin, by the mercy of God, biſhop of the holy catholic and apoſtolic church of the city of Rome, have ſigned as judge this definition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0010800101:204"/>the orthodox faith, and condemning Theodorus, formerly biſhop of Pharan, Cyrus of Alexandria, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, Pyrrhus, and Paul of Conſtantinople, and their heretical writings, with the impious ectheſis and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious type."</p>
                  <p>This authoritative definition and decree gave great umbrage, and did not ſoon ſubſide; for it appears, that the authority of the pope, ſo late as the year 669, was a matter of diſpute: it was not acknowledged in Italy itſelf without the limits of the Suburbicarian provinces, the ancient limits of the juriſdiction of the biſhop of Rome. Maurus, biſhop of Ravenna, being ſoon after ſummoned by Vitalianus, to Rome, to give an account of his faith and his conduct, not only refuſed to obey the ſummons, but let the pope know, that he had no authority over him or his ſee. This unexpected anſwer provoked Vitalianus to ſuch a degree, that he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately thundered againſt Maurus the ſentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; but of his excommunication he made no more account than he made of his ſummons; nay, thinking he had as good a right to excommunicate the pope as the pope had to excommunicate him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted the ſentence, and excommunicated him in his turn, which was thought a crime of ſo atrocious a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he was ſtripped of his prieſthood and reduced to the ſtate of a layman: but the biſhop of Ravenna being ſupported by the exarch, he continued, in ſpite of the pope to exerciſe all the functions of his office till his death, and then left it in charge with his laſt breath, never to ſubmit to the undue power aſſumed by the pope, which was ſtrictly adhered to by his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor

It was moved at their firſt ſeſſion, that the opinions of the fathers ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and diligently conſulted, in order to determine this point with greater certainty; and accordingly the ten firſt ſeſſions were ſpent in examining paſſages out of the fathers and approved councils; and in the 18th ſeſſion was read, and approved, and ſigned, the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and decree of the council, firſt acknowledging they received the five general councils; then they ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized the impious and execrable doctrine of one will, and the abettors of it, among whom was Honorius, biſhop of Rome, Cyrus of Alexandria, Macarius of Antioch, and others; and in the concluſion the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial edict was read, requiring all the ſubjects of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to conform in their belief to the preſent edict, on pain of being depoſed, if eccleſiaſtics; forfeiting their honour and eſtates, if laymen of rank and diſtinction; and if private perſons, to be baniſhed the city of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople and all other cities in the empire. This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere edict was founded on that doctrine being repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the faith of the holy catholic and apoſtolic church, and the opinion of the fathers.</p>
                  <p>Such was the conduct and concluſion of the ſixth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral council, declared to be of equal authority with the council of Nice, or any other council, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; according to pope Gregory the Great, equal with the goſpels themſelves; but by this council the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the pope is irreconcilable with that of the council, Honorius the pope being thereby condemned as a heretic, his books ordered to be burnt, and he over and over anathematized. Hence it is obſerved by ſome authors, that one would think the papal infallibility would be given up by all who pretend to acknowledge the authority and infallibility of this council.</p>

                  <p>In the ninth century, the papal dignity received a remarkable increaſe, with reſpect to the church. The pope of Rome aſſumed the title of univerſal biſhop, or head of the church; and ſtrenuouſly laboured to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

                  <p>Though the eaſtern patriarchs were not wanting in a vigorous oppoſition, yet the biſhops of Rome were very ſucceſsful in ſubjecting moſt of the weſtern churches to themſelves. The means made uſe of for this purpoſe, and the principal cauſes of it, were the ſuperſtitious veneration for the pretended chair of St. Peter; — the diviſions amongſt the clergy, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the cuſtom of appealing to the popes — the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation laid on the miſſionaries employed for preaching the goſpel among the pagans, to inſtruct them in the authority and dignity of the pope—their zeal likewiſe in aſſerting and vindicating his pre-eminence to thoſe of all other eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics, which was confirmed by grant of privileges, and particularly by ſending the pallium—the fantaſtical deſire of ſome prelates to be conſecrated by the pope himſelf — the ſeparation from the eaſtern churches, which was always decried as heretical—the ſtrict care taken to attach the body of the monks to the ſervice of the ſee of Rome—the collections of the papal decretals, and of the canon laws of Rome, &amp;c. were compiled for the direction of churches in general.</p>

                  <p>Nevertheleſs, in this century, the biſhops of Rome became poſſeſſed of territories and ſubjects, which at firſt proceeded from the princes and kings of France of the Carlovingeian line, who, in a great meaſure owing their promotion to the friendſhip of the pope, in the warmth of their gratitude, beſtowed poſſeſſions in Italy on the ſee of Rome: but, then, they conveyed to the pope no more than an uſufructuary enjoyment of certain territories, ſtill retaining the ſovereignty. In like manner the popes were inveſted with certain prerogatives, yet were ſubject to Charlemagne, as they had been before to the Greek emperors.</p>
                  <p>But the poſterity of Charlemagne having been driven out of Italy in the year 884, pope Hadrian III. ordained, that the popes ſhould, for the future, be conſecrated without applying to the emperor at all

                  <p>However, we may, in the laſt place, mention that, about the cloſe of this century, the kiſſing of the foot of the pope took place, as a token of reſpect, which had before been paid to the high prieſt among the pagans.</p>
                  <p>From this time, to about the middle of the next century, wherein Italy laboured under the extremeſt

                  <p>Popes were then excommunicated by their ſucceſſors, and their acts cancelled and annulled, not excepting the very adminiſtration of the ſacraments. Six popes were driven out, and dethroned, by thoſe who aſpired to their places.</p>

                  <p>Otho obliged the Roman people, and pope Leo VIII. who had been put in the place of pope John, to give up to the emperors the right of electing popes for thirty-ſix years, and within that ſpace, out of twelve two were elected peaceably, but the others not without tumult and diſorder, which occaſioned Benedict V. to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried priſoner by Otho I.

                  <p>The appellation of pope, which originally ſignifies papa, was firſt appropriated to the biſhop of Rome by Gregory VII. A. D. 1050.</p>
                  <p>The cardinals had the red hat now given them as an enſign of their dignity, and the election of the popes was limited to the cardinals, beſides other ſingular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges which they now enjoy.</p>
                  <p>Pope Gregory VII. forced the biſhops to take an oath
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0010800101:217"/>of fealty to the popes, and by a decree enacted, that none ſhould dare to condemn any one who had appealed to the pope.—Having firſt openly avowed, that as pope, he had an inherent and abſolute power over all ſovereigns, he took upon him to cite the emperor Henry to appear and anſwer for his conduct at Rome. Henry deſpiſed thoſe citations, for which he was excommunicated by Gregory, who threatened the ſame to Philip I. of France, and iſſued his fulminations againſt moſt of the princes of Europe. He governed all the Weſtern churches with an abſolute authority, and did all that was in his power to get himſelf made the ſovereign monarch of the univerſe.—The <hi>dictatus papae,</hi> which contains twenty-ſeven propoſitions in behalf of the higheſt pretenſions of the court of Rome, was wrote by this pope. The papiſts confeſs they are aſhamed of thoſe propoſitions; and particularly the twenty-third, which declares, that the Roman pontiff being canonically or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, becomes undoubtedly holy by the merits of St. Peter

                  <p>Pope Gregory VII. beſides his repeated excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, and the frequent rebellions which he ſtirred up and fomented, prevailed even with the emperor's eldeſt ſon to join in rebellion againſt his father, who, by this means, was almoſt driven out of Italy; and the ſucceeding pope, Victor III. purſued the ſame methods in carrying on the war, poured out his excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions afreſh upon the Emperor, plyed him with frequent rebellions, urged his ſon Henry againſt him, and at length induced him to take arms; ſo that at laſt, after great viciſſitudes of fortune, he came to an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but was deceived in the conditions, and in the end reduced to a private life, by a reſignation of his empire to his ſon, whom he cauſed to be crowned king.</p>
                  <p>This unnatural ſon, when his father came to the diet, held at Mentz, with a numerous army, not long after, went to meet him, and caſting himſelf at his feet,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0010800101:218"/>begged pardon with all the outward marks of a ſincere repentance: the emperor was wrought upon by this feigned ſubmiſſion, and they both went together to Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, where the ſon deluded the father, raiſing a jealouſy in him, that the archbiſhop of Mentz might keep him priſoner, if he entered that city before he was abſolved from his excommunication: therefore, adviſing him to ſtay at Bingen, while he went to diſpoſe the princes of the adverſe party, at that diet, to a reconciliation, the emperor ſwallowed the bait. The ſon went to the diet without him, and by the inſtigation of the pope, got him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf proclaimed emperor.</p>
                  <p>Paſcal II. the fourth pope from Gregory VII. took up the ſpiritual arms of excommunication, to wreſt the inveſtiture of biſhops and abbots out of the hands of the emperors, held a council at Guaſtalla in Mantua, and another at Troyes in France, and renewed the decrees of Gregory VII. that no laick ſhould intermeddle with the collation of benefices. Violent quarrels, conteſts, and wars, enſued, which extended to the next cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Paul, p. 92.</note>. But the emperor came to Italy with a powerful army, and obtained a revocation of that decree.</p>
                  <p>Some fathers of the council made uſe of this dilemma. "If the decree, by which the pope conſented to yield up the inveſtitures to the emperor, was lawful, it ought to be obſerved: but if it be unjuſt, and, as ſome ſay, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, the pope, as the author of it, is therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and heretical alſo

                  <p>In this century the pope of Rome and other eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics attempted with great vigour to ſubject to themſelves princes, and their kingdoms and ſtates, urging, that the ſplendor of their dignity was to that of the majeſty of emperors and kings as the effulgence of the ſun to the borrowed light of the moon; and therefore they demanded from crowned heads the moſt extravagant marks of reſpect:—they then claimed the right of conferring royal dignity, and particularly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to conſider the imperial crown as abſolutely at their diſpoſal, and by the pretenders they ſet up, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of entire kingdoms, provinces, and countries: they excommunicated emperors, kings, and princes, on the ſlighteſt occaſions; laid their dominions under an interdict; diſcharged their ſubjects from their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and even diſſolved the ſacred bonds of marriage

<note n="†" place="bottom">Dupin, Century XII.</note>, much to the ſame purpoſe, tells us, that the church of Rome was diſturbed by obſtinate ſchiſms; the popes at war with the emperors; the kings and biſhops diſputing about their temporal rights; the immunities of the church, and of eccleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſtrenuouſly oppoſed, and in conſequence, were as vigorouſly ſupported by the biſhops, and maintained by the decrees of councils; the church over-ſtocked with monaſtic and other orders of monks; ſcholaſtic divinity made the common ſtudy of the clergy; and the dignity of the ſacraments, and the external worſhip, were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected by many prevailing hereſies. The ſtruggles and contentions betwixt the pope and the emperor were not confined to Italy and Germany alone, which were the kingdoms and dominions of the emperor; but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral biſhops in France took occaſion to oppoſe the king; but, as they were not enough united to enter all into the ſame league with the pope, the king generally carried his point
<note n="§" place="bottom">Dupin's Preface to the twelfth Century, folio edit.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In England, where the king had hitherto conferred the biſhopricks and abbies, Anſelm, archbiſhop of Canterbury, in the year 1102, in obedience to the pope's decrees, began to refuſe to conſecrate biſhops nominated by the king. This conteſt held for many years, the king, viz. Henry I. maintaining his right, and the archbiſhop, ſupported by the pope, oppoſing it: the king, in hopes to bring the pope to hear reaſon, ſent an ambaſſador to Rome, who, provoked by the rough an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers and menaces of the pope, declared, that his maſter would never yield up his authority, though he loſt his kingdom in its defence; to which the pope, with no leſs boldneſs, replied, he would never ſuffer the king to nominate to the benefices if he loſt his head. The king, on the ambaſſador's return, exerted his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and Anſelm, the archbiſhop, was obliged to quit the kingdom; nor could he return without
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0010800101:221"/>complying with the king's pleaſure.—But this prince dying, and a civil war enſuing, it was eaſy for the clergy to introduce into England what the pope had done in his empire.</p>
                  <p>In that ſpace of time, between the years 1122, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Henry renounced the inveſtiture by the pope, and 1145, it became a rule almoſt every where in Germany, that, upon the death of a biſhop, his ſucceſſor ſhould be choſen by the chapter, and confirmed by the metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan; that the abbots ſhould be choſen by the monks, and then confirmed by the biſhop, if the monaſtery were not exempted and if it were, then the pope was to be applied to for his confirmation; that the other benefices, which were <hi>de jure patronatus,</hi> ſhould be conferred by the biſhops upon the preſentation of the patron; and that all the reſt ſhould be at the entire diſpoſal of the biſhop. — Nevertheleſs, the election of the popedom came under no new regulation
<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Paul of Beneficiary Matters, p. 106.</note>.</p>
                  <p>However, the emperor held a right with reſpect to ſome churches; and the pope, unwilling to revive the old quarrel, as it were, ſhared ſnacks with him under various pretences.</p>
                  <p>France, however, retained the royal prerogative (call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Regale) of conferring all ſimple benefices vacant upon the biſhops death, until a ſucceſſor was appointed. — But near the cloſe of the next century we find Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face VIII. had a ſharp conteſt with Philip of France, and ruined the kingdom, in great meaſure, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications, interdicts, &amp;c. and, at length, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived the king of his throne, and for ſome time gave it to the emperor Albert, depriving thoſe of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, who held them under the king
<note n="†" place="bottom">Abſtract from Father Paul of Beneficiary Matters, ibid.</note>. This proved one conſiderable means of enlarging the power of the pope.</p>
                  <p>Another conſiderable means of increaſing the papal power was the buſineſs of tythes, firſt fruits, &amp;c. which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0010800101:222"/>was made to extend to fiſheries, hay, wool, bees, &amp;c. which were exacted under the ſevereſt cenſures. — And in order the better to promote their wealth and power, they revoked a law that had been made, that the church ſhould reject the donations and legacies of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſinners; but this obſtacle was removed, and the pope and clergy endeavoured to prove thoſe donations a kind of extenuations where they could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced meritorious.</p>
                  <p>The large opportunities which the court of Rome had in their hands, of obliging by the diſpoſal of ſo many benefices, drew thither a concourſe of the clergy of all ſorts; of thoſe who had no beneficies, to obtain them; and thoſe who had, to get them exchanged for better: and this occaſioned frequent abſence, they were obliged to purchaſe indulgence or abſence of leave from their cures. — Commendams was alſo another pretty device: when an elective benefice became vacant ſuch as a biſhopric abby, — the care of it was recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſuperior to ſome perſon of merit, or of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, till another was choſe: afterwards it was given for a certain time

                  <p>But among other meaſures that contributed to render the pope ſupreme governor of all Chriſtendom, and to center the riches of the world in the treaſury of the church, were the cruſades or martial expeditions againſt infidels, eſpecially as the clergy were fond of preaching againſt heretics, as they called them and their protectors. "This device," ſays Mezeray, "was a very ſucceſsful means to aggrandize the pope; for they ordered princes to enroll themſelves in thoſe expeditions; they retained the ſovereign command of thoſe armies by their legates; and they became, in ſome ſort, lords in chief of all who went to the cruſade, not only becauſe the pope exacted obedience from them, but becauſe they took the other under their protection till their return, which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0010800101:223"/>was like letters of ſtate, and ſuſpended all civil and criminal proceedings
<note n="§" place="bottom">Mezeray's Life of Philip Auguſtus.</note>."</p>
                  <p>But the greateſt ſupport of all this uſurpation was the eſtabliſhment of the inquiſition in Italy, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Gratian's collection of canon laws. — Add to this the practice of canonization as an excellent means to ſecure conſtancy in the faith of the Romiſh church; to enrich the papal treaſury; and to extend that power not only to the diſpoſal of temporal crowns and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but even of celeſtial crowns too, when it was ſubſervient to their ambition or intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Pope Celeſtine III. was a remarkable inſtance of this boundleſs ambition, who having been formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by Henry with ſeveral favours, was more inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to crown him, in order to which the young empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror haſtened to Rome with his empreſs, and they were both crowned by this holy father in an unprecidented and moſt remarkable manner.

                  <p>The ninth general council was held at Lateran, A.

                  <p>In this century ſeveral inſtitutions took place: two military orders of monks were appointed, viz. thoſe of St. John of Jeruſalem, who were to take care of the pilgrims who went to that city: — the other were the templers, whoſe office it was to provide for the ſafety of pilgrims, by fighting in their defence againſt ſuch as oppoſed or moleſted them

That ſummit of power ſeems to terminate with pope Boniface the VIIIth, towards the cloſe of this century, who arrogated to himſelf the power of depoſing princes by divine right—publiſhed a bull, by which he forbid all princes to exact any thing out of the eccleſiaſtical revenues.—He likewiſe inſtituted a jubilee, whereby he granted plenary indulgences to all who ſhould viſit the church of St. Peter and St. Paul at Rome, and ordained the ſame ſhould be obſerved every century.

                  <p>Father Paul gives us a compendium of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: he ſays, "By various methods the popes drew to themſelves a great part of the collation of benefices in all the Chriſtian kingdoms in the weſt; but, in the eaſtern churches, they were not allowed to diſpoſe of one benefice. In Italy, indeed, they met with ſuch great ſucceſs, that they flattered themſelves they ſhould impoſe on all Europe.</p>
                  <p>In England, where the benefices are very rich, the Roman courtiers made ſuch mighty acquiſitions, that,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0010800101:226"/>in the year 1232, the clergy and military men of the kingdom formed a confederacy or aſſociation, and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged all the goods and revenues of the beneficed Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man clergy throughout the iſland. The pope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the king, under pain of excommunication, to chaſtiſe them with his temporal arms, and the biſhops to excommunicate them; but the confederacy was too ſtrong, either for the king to puniſh, or the biſhops to excommunicate them.</p>

                  <p>As for cardinals, nothing can be ſurpriſing that is ſaid of them, when one conſiders the ſtile of the court of Rome, <hi>regibus aequi parantur</hi>

But is there any thing in this that exceeds the ordinary terms of ſpeaking on this ſubject, ſeeing it is the tenet of every canoniſt, that the pope can grant diſpenſations for holding as many benefices as he pleaſes? and this was ſometimes done contrary to the letter of the law, and therefore, in ſome parts of Europe, treated with marks of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation.</p>

                  <p>The popes themſelves gave many flagrant inſtances of their fallibility, even in doctrine, crowned heads oppoſed their inſolence, and publicly declared them heretics, and that too with the approbation of many eminent divines.

                  <p>The firſt is, that the pope has no authority or right to command or order any thing, either in general or particular, in which the temporalities or civil rights of the kingdom are concerned.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, that, notwithſtanding the pope's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy is owned in matters purely ſpiritual, this is to be underſtood as under the regulation, and ſubordinate to, the decrees of councils, canons, &amp;c. and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and preſent privileges of that nation

                  <head>CENTURY THE FOURTEENTH.</head>
                  <p>This century affords many dreadful examples of the popes and biſhops exciting and inflaming catholic princes againſt the Albigenſes, and all others, whom they ſtigmatiſed with the name of heretics, either by public cruſades, or private tribunals before inquiſitors, to deſtroy them. Accordingly ſeveral religious orders were inſtituted in this century, viz. of the preaching brothers, whoſe office and buſineſs was to be zealous declaimers againſt the Albigenſes. They had a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery at Paris, in St. James's houſe, thence called Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins—another order of minims—of Auguſtine her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits—Carmelites—the order of Maria de la Merci— of ſervites and celeſtins: theſe grew ſo numerous, that Gregory X. at the general council, forbid eſtabliſhing any new ones

                  <p>The thirteenth general council was held at Lyons, 1245, as well for civil as eccleſiaſtical affairs. Three points were aimed at by the pope, viz. to relieve the empire of Conſtantinople againſt the Greeks, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Germany againſt the Tartars, and the Holy Land againſt the Saracens: for theſe purpoſes, they decreed the twentieth part of the revenues of all eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical benefices, and the tenth of the revenues of the pope; but exempted the croiſado prieſt from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions in this council. The pope excommunicated the emperor Frederic, and diſpoſſeſſed him of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, on ſuſpicion of his having been dilatory in ſupply of the papal chair, and, to ſhew his own great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity now, he poſſeſſed it

                  <p>The fourteenth general council was held at Lions, A. D. 1274, for the relief of the Holy Land, for the reunion of the Greek church, and for the reforming the church diſcipline. In the fourth ſeſſion, the union of the Greek church was attempted, but on ſuch points of faith as were of an indeterminate nature, particularly relating to the Trinity, and the union propoſed could not be effected.</p>
                  <p>The fourteenth century further evinces, that the popes could not longer enjoy that vaſt degree of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0010800101:230"/>to which they had aſpired, nor ſupport their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable uſurpation in quiet: their authority was often called in queſtion, till they were obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in part from their pretenſions. Philip, king of France, gave ſeveral great blows to the papal authority; and from the enſuing ſchiſms of double elections, when the oppoſite factions choſe different popes at the ſame time, an occaſion was taken to bridle the popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by calling councils, which often proceeded ſo far as to depoſe the holy fathers. To this may be added, that the tranſlation of the papal chair, by Clement V. from Rome to Avignon, where the popes conſtantly reſided for ſeventy years together, carried along with it ſeveral inconveniencies, which proved greatly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the eccleſiaſtical monarchy. Among others, the popes authority being founded upon this belief, that St. Peter had been at Rome, and by his preſence had communicated a particular prerogative and holineſs to that chair, it was very much queſtioned whether the ſame could be transferred to Avignon

                  <p>Boniface IX. was the firſt who exacted annates, i. e. one year's revenue of every biſhopric and abby, at each inſtallment
<note n="†" place="bottom">Dupin's Hiſt. ch. v. 4. p. 265.</note>; had publiſhed a bull, and declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſovereign lord, both in temporals and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals. King Philip of France burnt this bull, and ſent the following anſwer to the pope: <q>Philip, by the grace of God, king of the Franks, to Boniface, who ſets up for ſovereign pontiff, little or no health. Be it known to your great extravagance, that we are not ſubject to any perſon whatſoever as to what regards temporals; that the collation of churches and prebendſhips belongs to us by a royal right, and that we have a power to appropriate the fruits of it to ourſelves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the popes had aſſumed great part of the power to themſelves, of which they had ſtripped the emperor, John XXII. in the year 1316, made a decree,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0010800101:231"/>that for three years, whoever obtained a benefice of more that twenty-four ducats of yearly rent, ſhould pay one year's value, for the expedition of his bull.</p>
                  <p>Some few years after the inſtitution, or reſervation of annates, king Edward, in the year 1373, ſent an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to pope Gregory XI. then at Avignon, to preſs him to annul the reſervations entirely, which, after it had been in agitation, were the next year totally abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by this pope.</p>
                  <p>But a great ſchiſm ariſing in the church upon his death, which happened in the year 1378, and produced two popes, and confequently two courts, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary expences to ſupport them were alſo doubled. Thus all inventions for fleecing the people were ſet on work with freſh vigour. Simony appeared no where ſo bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, the two courts holding an open market for benefices; and every eſſay was made that was poſſible to ſtrip the ordinary collators of the right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto the court of Rome had not taken off the maſk, nor had ſo avowedly owned that paſſion ſhe had for money; but pope Urban VI. left it no longer to conjecture, why he concerned himſelf with the collation of benefices, when he declared, that no preſentation ſhould be good, where the value was not expreſſed
<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Paul.</note>.</p>
                  <p>By theſe methods the apoſtolic chamber came to a juſter knowledge of the value of the annates. This was thought by ſome to be no better than putting up the benefices to auction: but on the other hand, it was inſinuated, that it was only to prevent the holy chamber being defrauded of their right.</p>
                  <p>No body can deny, but that the diſorders were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious in the Roman courts on this occaſion; and that many neighbouring kingdoms were ſo greatly alarmed and diſguſted at the variety of tricks and ſhifts they ſaw practiſed, that they came at laſt to acknowledge neither of the competitors for pope. Germany refuſed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0010800101:232"/>to ſubmit to the reſervations. Innocent VII. ſent his legate into Germany, to grant new bulls for certain ſums to ſuch as had come in by epiſcopal collation, and to compound for the firſt fruits. But the emperor Charles IV. forbad the levying them, ſaying it was neceſſary to reform the manners of the clergy, but not their purſes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe confuſions received a conſiderable increaſe by the addition of a third pope, which, with the king of France's meaſures, will be related in the hiſtory of the next century.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the Greek church, ſays Dupin, was diſturbed by frivolous queſtions; the order of franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can monks torn in pieces by odd opinions, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant practices; diverſe errors taught by divines, condemned by the biſhops, or univerſities; and ſeveral diſorders ſuppreſſed by the inſtitutions of councils and biſhops. The divines which flouriſhed in this age, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the methods of the ſchools, as their predeceſſors had done. The commentators upon holy ſcripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced nothing great nor excellent; and the hiſtorians, nothing exact or perfect.

                  <head>CENTURY THE FIFTEENTH.</head>
                  <p>The Fifteenth Century of the church is full of great tranſactions: the ſchiſm of the popes, which appeared at the beginning of it, was, for many years, the great care and buſineſs of the prelates and Chriſtian princes of the weſt; beſides this, the difference between the council of Baſil and pope Eugenius IV. and the project of the re-union of the Greeks to the Latin church, were the great concerns of Chriſtendom: but the former had not thoſe miſchievous conſequences which were feared, nor the latter the ſucceſs which was hoped for. Among many other remarkable events, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made in ſeveral parts of Germany to the errors and enormities of the church of Rome had this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, to put men upon the ſtudy of uſeful learning, upon ſearching the ſcripture and tradition; and it obliged the prelates to labour after a reformation of the clergy, ſo generally and ſo juſtly complained of; as alſo to make many regulations in the diſcipline of the church; in which the church of France more particularly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed

<note n="‖" place="bottom">Abſ. from the Preface of Monſ. Dupin, to Century XV.</note>.</p>
                  <p>This ſchiſm is generally conſidered with regard to the meaſures they had taken, and the effects of them; the buſineſs of collation, of benefices, the reſervation of annates, &amp;c. had very much incenſed ſome of the neighbouring princes, who were jealous of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects property. One of the firſt ſteps taken by the king of France was, his letters of ſubtraction, as they were called, which is a declaration of withdrawing from his obedience, publiſhed in the year 1408, which had a very good effect. But in the year 1409, a third pope was elected, to whom, though France paid obedience, yet ſhe ſtood firm in maintaining the king's edict by which all reſervations, annates, and other exactions of the court of Rome, were forbid, until they were ſettled by a lawful general council; and it happened at that time, that the parliament of Paris were in part compoſed of counſellors that were well eſtabliſhed in the eccleſiaſtical laws; and thoſe made a noble ſtand againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments attempted to be made by the pope's eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical judges.</p>
                  <p>In the ſixteenth general council, held at Conſtance, the ſchiſm of the popes was extinguiſhed, by one of the popes having renounced, after he had fled from the council and been brought back again and depoſed, viz. John XXIII. And the two others having been depoſed, viz. Gregory XII. and Benedict XIII. in the year 1417. Martin V. was elected pope at the general council.</p>
                  <p>Great hopes were entertained, that the council and the pope together, the two moſt powerful concurrents upon earth, would ſet themſelves to reform the many abuſes that had crept into the church; and, indeed, the council recommended it to the pope: but from their deſire of returning home, and ſome difficulties which they found attended it, it was put off for a more convenient ſeaſon,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0010800101:235"/>under the direction of a future council; ſo that council terminated April 12, 1418
<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Paul of Beneſices and Revenue, p. 196.</note>.</p>
                  <p>But they firſt condemned the errors of John Huſs and Wickliffe, and in which John Huſs was condemned to be burnt.</p>
                  <p>The French not being willing to ſtay ſo long, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was made in the parliament of Paris, that no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhould be paid to the pope, unleſs he firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and acknowledged the king's edict
<note n="†" place="bottom">Conſerence of Ordinances, lib. I. tit. iiii. p. 283.</note>, which ſuppreſſed the reſervations and exactions of money in France.</p>
                  <p>The pope, being apprized of this by his nuncios, agrees to it for that time; but having gained ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the univerſity to his party, in the year 1422, he again attempted to make the reſervations: however, he failed in the attempt, and they proceeded to the impriſonment of all his adherents, the rector of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and divers others of the members and fellows; and upon the pope's putting the city of Lyons under interdiction, becauſe that city obeyed the king's edict, the parliament ſtrictly forbad their obedience to it.</p>
                  <p>This diſpute laſted till the year 1424, when matters were compromized betwixt them; they had, as it were, divided the power, and the advantages: but it did not prove to the ſatisfaction of either parties, ſo it laſted but a little while. However, at the end of about ſeven years, Martin died, to whom ſucceeded Eugene IV. during whoſe popedom, in 1431, the council of Baſil took in hand the reformation ſo neceſſary. All reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations were prohibited, except of thoſe benefices which were vacant in curia, the annates, and many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions peculiar to that court.</p>
                  <p>The pope finding ſuch a check given to his power, after many attempts to obtain an alteration, came to an open rupture with them. The pope diſſolved the council—the council deprived the pope, and choſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.—This
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0010800101:236"/>bred another ſchiſm in the church.—France and Germany received the decrees of this council; and in the year 1438, the famous Pragmatic Sanction, which Mezeray calls the bulwark of the Gallican church, was publiſhed in France, which reſtored the elections to the chapters, the collations to the ordinaries, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the reſervations.</p>
                  <p>In this century, viz. at the council of Bourges, 1438, their decrees were principally taken out of thoſe of the council of Baſil: for when pope Eugenius uſed his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to diſſolve the council of Baſil, and to deſtroy its authority, the fathers of the council ſent their deputies into France to preſent the decrees and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions which they had made for the reformation of, eccleſiaſtical, diſcipline to Charles VII. and the church of France. The king, not willing to do any thing in a matter of that importance, immediately convened a council of biſhops to examine thoſe decrees. The reſult was, giving a blow to the ſupremacy, by that maxim, firſt reduced to practice by the councils of Piſa, Conſtance, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil, and by the two laſt eſtabliſhed, as an article of faith, "That the pope is ſubject to a general council;" which doctrine proved the more fatal at Rome, as it has been received by the Gallican church as a mark of diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>But all the regulations made by them againſt thoſe innovations in their dominion, ſerved but to ſharpen the induſtry of the court of Rome, to find out other expedients which might prove effectual for theſe ends, under other pretexts, as well as to ſupply, by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of new rights, their defect of power in matters wherein the interpoſition of princes had reſtrained them.</p>
                  <p>It was about this time reſignations took place, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never before allowed to churchmen to quit the cure that had been aſſigned them; and till now it was thought incumbent on the miniſter, who had undertaken a charge, and received a recompence for it, that he ſhould continue to perform it to the end of his life: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this being permitted and encouraged, it turned to the advantage of the court of Rome, as it made
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0010800101:237"/>the more frequent, and enlarged the ſum ariſing from annates.</p>
                  <p>When the reſources of this kind began to dry up, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences and remiſſion of ſins were thought of in their room, to be beſtowed on ſuch perſons who ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute money for the holy war, or any other pious uſes: and this matter was carried ſo high, that every one knows, that the changes, that were made in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of thoſe indulgences, in Germany and many other parts of Europe, and which commenced pretty early in the next century, make no ſmall part of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>In Italy, where the council of Baſil never was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the adherence to the pope was more ſtrong, the reſervations had taken deeper root, every pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing them with eaſe, and introducing new preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and impoſitions, and ſhewing no inſtance of miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in the rigour of any of them, except where ſome expedient had been found to work the ſame effect an eaſier way.</p>
                  <p>In Germany, where the council of Baſil was by ſome admitted, by others not, there was great diverſity in the deciſions concerning beneficiary cauſes. To provide againſt and reconcile theſe differences, Nich. V. and the emperor Frederic III. in the year 1448, made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordat, concluded in the pope's name, to the following tenor: — That the benefices vacant in court ſhould be reſerved to the pope, and that the reſt of the elective benefices ſhould go by election
<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Paul of Beneficiary Matters, p. 206.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In France there were warm diſputes ſubſiſting for a conſiderable time, ſometimes the pope ſeeming to get the better in the controverſy, and ſometimes the king of France.</p>
                  <p>At length Leo X. framed a concordat with king Francis I. of France, that the pragmatic ſanction ſhould be aboliſhed, and the election of biſhops and abbots ſhould be taken from the cathedral and colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0010800101:238"/>churches, and given to the king, who was to name a fit perſon, and the pope to confer the benefice; it was farther concluded, that the pope could not give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectatives, nor make any reſervations, general or ſpecial: though there was great difficulty in getting this concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat to be received, the univerſity appealing to a general council lawfully convened, yet the king's authority and intereſt prevailed, and it was put in execution throughout.</p>
                  <p>Thus, after ſeveral popes, had between 1076 and 1150, thundered out ſo many excommunications, and occaſioned much rebellion and bloodſhed, in order to wreſt from princes the collation of biſhoprics, and to give the election to the chapters: on the contrary, the quarrel ſeems now inverted, and Pius II. and five of his ſucceſſors have, with the ſame zeal and conſtancy, been ſtruggling to take the election from the chapter, and give it to the king, which Leo the Tenth at laſt accompliſhed: ſo true it is, that a change in intereſts draws along with it both a change, and even a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in doctrines.</p>
                  <p>In a council held at Rouen, 1445, we have forty conſtitutions chiefly relating to the diſcipline of that church: there is one of them againſt the ſuperſtion of thoſe who gave particular names to the images of the Virgin, ſuch as our lady of recovery, our lady of pity, conſolation and grace: — they forbid the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the relics of ſaints in order to get money: clandeſtine marriages were likewiſe prohibited: others related to the morals and habits of eccleſiaſtics, the celebration of holy days, the payment of tenths, orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of churches, &amp;c. Theſe regulations are taken from the councils of Baſil, Lateran, the pragmatic ſanction, decretals, and other provincial councils

                  <p>M. Dupin in (the preface to) his hiſtory of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century obſerves, that the eccleſiaſtical hiſtory of this age deſerves the particular attention of all who have any concern for religion, there being no century in which there have been greater revolutions in the church. — The pope of Rome ſaw, with grief, a great part of Europe forſake their allegiance to his holineſs; ſeveral provinces of Germany, England, and Scotland, and ſeveral kingdoms of the North, were departed from his authority; and France, which till then had been free from ſuch monſters, as he calls them
<note n="*" place="bottom">Allowance muſt here be made for the religious tenets of this author. I have therefore made ſome variations.</note>, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome who were not leſs hurtful to the ſtate than to the church:—"But, ſays he," "if the church catholic loſt a good deal of its extent this way, it endeavoured to recompence the loſs in ſome ſort, by the reformation of manners and diſcipline, putting a ſtop to the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing clandeſtine marriages, and by puniſhing ſcandalous crimes, according to the rights of the eccleſiaſtical laws. For this purpoſe ſo many decrees and regulations were made in eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies, and eſpecially in the council of Trent, which, Dupin likewiſe, tells us, were to condemn errors to preſerve the purity of the faith, and to labour after the reformation of diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>Father Walch has given us a more particular, and I preſume impartial, view of this remarkable period. — He ſays, That in the firſt part of it, the internal corruption of the church of Rome was
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0010800101:240"/>become ſuch, as to exclude all external order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: — in the middle it received ſuch a ſhock, as it had never before felt, by the amazing progreſs of the reformation; and the latter part of this period was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in preſerving the wreck, and reſtoring, or reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, what had been loſt. This has been attended with many remarkable conſequences, ſome of which follow.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſpiritual monarchy of the pope, it was at firſt greatly endangered by thoſe who bore teſtimony to the truth, in ſpite of the baſe example of pope Pius II. and particularly by the proceedings of king Lewis XII. of France, and of the council of Piſa againſt pope Julius II.</p>
                  <p>But the advantage became irreparable, when gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually a conſiderable part of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Hungary, and Poland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, and Pruſſia, received the doctrine of the reformation, and withdrew entirely from their obedience to the ſee of Rome.—Beſides this, thoſe nations, which ſtill adhered to the doctrine of the church of Rome, not only admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted principles quite irreconcilable with the doctrine of an infallible head of the whole church, but alſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, by the frequent complaints againſt the ſee of Rome, and their earneſt ſolicitations for a council, threatened it with no ſmall danger; and Charles V. was even actually employed, at leaſt in Germany, in decide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religious points judicially.</p>
                  <p>Adrian VI. in 1522, ſent a letter to the duke of Saxony and other princes, to extirpate the heretics, the Lutherans, by fire and ſword, notwithſtanding he confeſſed to them, that there were great abuſes in the church of Rome, and that the eccleſiaſtics themſelves ſtood greatly in need of reformation: and even while the council of Trent were convened 1546, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing their anathemas againſt the proteſtants, the pope and emperor prepared another ſort of arms againſt them, in order to deſtroy their lives, as the ſureſt means
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0010800101:241"/>to ſuppreſs hereſy: but in this the emperor was too politic for the pope, for he took care to ſell ſome of the churches patrimony to defray the expence.</p>
                  <p>All this incited the ſee of Rome to ſtudy expedients for the better ſupport of the Roman catholic religion, and more eſpecially of the authority of the pope, and to ſecure it from further declenſion. About this time the order of Jeſuits, by the approbation and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pope, received its entire eſtabliſhment, and became a pillar, of which the papacy ſtood greatly in need, in 1540.</p>
                  <p>The council of Trent was very artfully made uſe of to anſwer theſe ends, quite contrary to its original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. The Roman legates were ſuffered to preſide in it, and they had not the liberty of agreeing to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or reſolutions, of the fathers, without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious conſent of the pope. All the doctrines, which contradicted the Romiſh errors, were condemned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing the proteſtants; and all the doctrines, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the church of Rome, were ſolemnly confirmed; a majority of votes was influenced to ſuppreſs the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines aſſented to by the greateſt part of the doctors then preſent, or they were decided by an authoritative ſentence from Rome, if they had the leaſt tendency to the prejudice of the papal court: thoſe queſtions, for inſtance, ſo fruitful in altercation, whether epiſcopacy be of divine original, and whether the pope was to be accounted the head of all churches, or of the univerſal church, were concluded in the affirmative without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; and the papal court reſerved and confirmed to itſelf, the amendment of its own abuſes; and in the laſt place, it was deemed the prerogative of the pope to interpret all the decrees; and it muſt be owned, that theſe methods had their

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0010800101:242"/>to find that whole nations, eſpecially France, Spain, and Hungary, either abſolutely refuſed their compliance, or by their exceptions, or reſervations, plainly ſhewed, that their oppoſition aroſe from the very doctrine therein contained of the ſupremacy of the pope: and hence, that very important diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>perfectly</hi> and <hi>partially</hi> obedient ſons of the holy father.</p>

                  <p>The pattern or method of proceeding in the council of Trent was taken from the latter occidental councils, and eſpecially from the laſt council of Lateran, by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral matters and things laid before ſeveral perſons appointed, which were denominated particular congregations; and then it was reported to the general aſſembly of biſhops: and this was done with great ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and the decrees read at the concluſion by one of them, each of the other ſignifying his ſentiments, by ſaying <hi>placet,</hi> or <hi>non placet.</hi> — We likewiſe find, that many of the biſhops met with a deſign to eſtabliſh the ſuperiority of the church, and general councils over the pope; to promote a reformation in the church; and likewiſe with moderate diſpoſitions towards ſuch as might differ from them in ſentiments, and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their collegues humility and charity: but this will not hold true of the majority: the pope's legates were preſent, and had an undue influence, as will appear in the ſequel. — One inſtance appeared even in the ſecond ſeſſion, when many of the council were for opening that ſeſſion, with ſome propoſals for a general reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the pope's legates oppoſed it, and after ſome
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0010800101:243"/>debate, cardinal Pool obtained, as a proper expedient, that the ſymbol of the Nicene, or creed of the church of Rome, ſhould be confirmed; ſome made a jeſt of that, as it had been received in the church for twelve hundred years; however, the more penetrating ſaw through the policy of that ſcheme, viz. that nothing might afterwards be propoſed in oppoſition to it. — The third ſeſſion was principally taken up with the progreſs that the reformation made in Germany; the elector Palatine having re-eſtabliſhed the communion under both kinds, the marriage of prieſts, and the ſervice in the vulgar tongue; which gave great offence to the pope's legates. — In the fourth ſeſſion, purſuant to the order given by the pope, they proceeded to take under their conſideration the <hi>ſcriptures.</hi> This was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to four heads, chiefly relative to ſuch points as were intended to be condemned in the proteſtants, viz. the ſufficiency of holy ſcripture, and the neceſſity of traditions; the ſecond, of the canonical books and their number; the third was about the authority of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tranſlation, and the neceſſity of having recourſe to the originals; and the fourth related to the proper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of ſcripture: and it was concluded, that all matters and things condemned ſhould be by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth ſeſſion they alſo entered upon the doctrine of original ſin, to which there was a great oppoſition: they diſcuſſed ſome of the ſubtleties of that queſtion, as, How Adam's ſin, which conſiſted in the tranſgreſſion of a law, could be conveyed or tranſmitted to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? and nine articles of the Zuinglans were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as not expreſſive, or conſiſtent, with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of original ſin, though they admitted a depravity or corruption of nature. The prelates diſpute much, but appear to be ignorant of the point, or the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the Zuinglans. This introduced a diſpute concerning the immaculate conception of the Bleſſed Virgin. — The fifth ſeſſion related to preachers, in which the mendicant monks took poſſeſſion of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0010800101:244"/>but reſidencies enjoined upon them. — In the ſixth ſeſſion the ſubjects of grace and juſtification, in which the point of abſolute predeſtination, final perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, were taken into their conſideration; and at length the decrees were made with great ambiguity, and with ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſoes, as permitted the pope, or the church, finally to determine it. — In the ſeventh ſeſſion the council diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed the points of baptiſm and extreme unction: their ordinances on theſe points were merely trifling, notwithſtanding they beſtowed anathema's on ſuch who did not deem them ſacred; ſome abuſes from plurality of benefices were mentioned, but it terminated in the authority of diſpenſations. — The eighth ſeſſion was concerning the removal of the council to Bologna, which paſſed in the affirmative.</p>
                  <p>The ninth ſeſſion, and firſt of Bologna, ſettled only the formularies of the aſſembly. In 1547, a diet at Augſburg was held, in which they promiſed to ſubmit to that council; nevertheleſs, when the council did not coincide with their principles, they acted in oppoſition it, more from policy than regard to truth, and though much in favour of proteſtants, and liberty of conſcience, was not regarded by many of them as ſubſtantial and laſting.</p>
                  <p>In 1549 pope Paul died. Julius III. ſucceeded him, who was prevailed on, by the emperor, to re-eſtabliſh the council at Trent, wherein the emperor was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and the proteſtants of Augſbug have free liberty to be heard concerning the points of faith in which they differed from the church of Rome: but we meet with no ſuch happy conſequences ariſing from it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the eleventh nor twelfth ſeſſion. However, in the thirteenth ſeſſion, the council enters upon buſineſs, chuſes the point of the euchariſt for doctrine, and the juriſdiction of biſhops for reformation; the firſt of theſe was debated for ſome time: at length, decreed, that communion in one kind was ſufficient, and pronounced
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0010800101:245"/>anathema's againſt ſuch as denied the real preſence, tranſubſtantiation, the adoration, of the hoſt, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In 1521 was held the congregation, conſiſting only of doctors of the canon law, for handling the matter of diſcipline, which is the original of the juriſdiction of the tribunals of the church. This congregation was held at Trent, but did not interfere with the council of prelates. Gropper votes for the aboliſhing an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical tribunal, and wrote againſt it. This introduced the original of degradations, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The thirteenth ſeſſion of the council of Trent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the decrees and anathemas of the council, in the former ſeſſion, againſt thoſe who denied the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in one kind, the real preſence, &amp;c. Penance, extreme unction, and the reformation in favour of the epiſcopal juriſdiction, were points determined; but they could not agree with reſpect to decrees, which were therefore referred to ſome future time; afterwards was re-aſſumed in the third convocation of the council under pope Pius IV.</p>
                  <p>The fourteenth ſeſſion, the council refuſe to hear the proteſtants, notwithſtanding the emperor's promiſe; however, a new, ſafe conduct was obtained for ſome of the proteſtants of Wirtenberg and Bohemia, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was given to the ambaſſadors of Saxony, which principally engaged the attention of the council the fifteenth, ſixteenth, ſeventeenth, and eighteenth ſeſſions: however. in Auguſt, 1552, the landgrave of Heſſe was enlarged, liberty of conſcience granted under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reſtrictions, and baniſhed miniſters recalled.</p>
                  <p>In 1553, another remarkable event intervened. Edward VI. king of England died, July 6, and Mary, his ſiſter, ſucceeded to the throne, who pretended at firſt, that ſhe would alter nothing in religion, though ſhe was a Roman catholic; but this promiſe was ſoon counteracted by her attempts to introduce the Roman catholic religion into theſe kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>In 1555, a diet was called at Augſburg, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the troubles in religion, during which the pope
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0010800101:246"/>died. Paul IV. ſucceeded him, whoſe character was that of proud and inſolent. The diet made a decree in favour of liberty of conſcience, which ſo diſpleaſed the pope, that he liſtened to the perſuaſions of ſome, to ſupport his authority by the ſword; but party quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with princes ſeem to have diverted him from the intention he had formed.</p>
                  <p>In 1558, Mary, queen of England, died, and her ſiſter, Elizabeth. ſucceeded, which was looked upon as a mortal blow to the ſee of Rome. She thought it to no purpoſe to diſſemble, with reſpect to her princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and therefore ſent advice to her ſiſters ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador at Rome, and ordered him to acquaint the pope of her advancement to the throne. The pope anſwered, that ſhe had been very bold to take the crown and name of queen without his leave.</p>
                  <p>In 1561, the pope, by his bull, invites not only catholic but proteſtant princes to the council of Trent, and diſpatches the abbot Martimengo to the queen of England; but, as ſoon as it was known to her, ſhe forbad him to enter her dominions. A conference was likewiſe appointed at Poiſſy, between the Roman ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics and the proteſtants. The council at Trent met in 1562, called the ſeventeenth ſeſſion, or the firſt of the third convocation, in which the books written in ſupport of hereſy, as they termed it, were ordered to be ſuppreſſed, and an edict publiſhed for the ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the German proteſtants. In the eighteenth ſeſſion, they enter upon the point of the reſidence of biſhops, and the queſtion, If it be of divine right? was ſtarted and argued with great warmth, which laſted the nineteenth ſeſſion. In the twentieth, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumed the diſpute of communion in both kinds, and concluded it again in the negative; and it was confirmed in the twenty-firſt ſeſſion, then the matter of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the maſs was choſen for their deliberation. This head was divided into thirteen articles, wherein were comprehended all the controverſies about that ſubject, which are at this day argued between the church of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0010800101:247"/>Rome and the proteſtants, viz. Whether the maſs be a propitiatory ſacrifice? Whether it derogates from the ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt? Whether Jeſus Chriſt, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Do this,</hi> hath appointed the ſacrifice of his body? Whether private maſſes be lawful and good? Whether it be lawful to celebrate maſſes in honour of ſaints? Whether the ceremonies of the maſs are good and holy? Whether there be errors in the canon of the maſs? Whether the words of conſecration ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with a low voice? with other queſtions of little importance.</p>
                  <p>The French ſtayed at the council with very little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; for they ſaw that matters of the higheſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were determined with very little regard to the prelates of their nation, and by the Spaniſh, Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe, and Italian biſhops, and that all propoſals to a reformation were over-ruled by a number of penſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary biſhops, aſſerting, that the court of Rome was miſtreſs of all deliberations, as well as propoſitions: ſo that the giving or with-holding the cup from the laity was referred to the deciſion of the pope.</p>
                  <p>The twenty-ſecond ſeſſion affords us further proof, that the biſhops were ill ſatisfied of the infallibility of the council; and the ambaſſadors of France received new orders from their court, for aſſerting their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the meaſures taken by the council. The ſacrament of orders was handled, and whether the Holy Ghoſt be given in ordination; which was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the affirmative. The Germans queſtion the divine right of epiſcopacy, which occaſioned very warm debates.</p>
                  <p>The French begin the new year, 1563, with thirty-four new demands, relating to abuſes, which greatly alarmed the pope when communicated to him. A decree is ſent from Rome concerning the pope's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which met with much contradiction. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe debated the ſubject of marriages and divorce, and of the celibacy of prieſts; wherein it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that it could not be ſaid, without hereſy,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0010800101:248"/>that a prieſt could marry notwithſtanding their vow. The pope, much diſſatisfied with the conduct of ſome of the French, ordered the tribunal of the inquiſition to proceed againſt them.</p>
                  <p>The twenty-third and twenty-fourth ſeſſion turned upon ſome difference that had ariſen between the pope and the king of France, and with the queen of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre, on the ſuſpicion of hereſy.</p>
                  <p>The twenty-fifth and laſt ſeſſion of this council, held Dec. 3, 1563, the prelates and ambaſſadors went to church with the uſual ceremonies, when Jerome Ragaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone, titular biſhop of Nazianzo, made a ſermon in praiſe of the council, recapiculated the good laws and ordinances which were made in it, and read the decrees concerning purgatory, the interceſſion and invocation of ſaints, images, and their worſhip; they alſo read the decree for reformation of monks, containing twenty chapters, and one was added to ſhield the pope's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to leave him in full liberty to diſpenſe with all the canons. — The ſecond day they alſo read the decrees concerning indulgences, the choice of meats, faſts, and holy days; they made an act of reference to the pope about the index expurgatorius, miſſals, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viaries, ceremonials, and the care of making a cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm.</p>
                  <p>This laſt ſeſſion of the council gave as little ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the reſt had done; for after all the fair promiſes of ſetting about a reformation, there was nothing of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance effected, except ſome regulations that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonged to civil government. Germany ſlighted the council to the higheſt degree; for the prelates of this nation had not been preſent in the laſt convocation; very few biſhops from Hungary or Poland; none at all from England, Swedeland, Denmark, or the Low Countries; the French biſhops came only at the latter end; and including the Spaniards, they did not exceed the number of forty: all the reſt were Italians, to the number of 150, and therefore it had the name of the Council of the Pope and the Italians. The pope, on
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0010800101:249"/>the 26th of December, gave the bull of confirmation, wherein he forbids, under pain of excommunication, the publiſhing of any commentaries, or obſervations, upon the councils, ordaining, in all doubtful caſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to be had to the holy ſee.</p>
                  <p>What regard was paid to this council by the French, is evident from the following citation: for, at the cloſing of the council of Trent, Du Ferrier, the king's ambaſſador, entered his proteſt againſt every thing of a civil nature, that had been tranſacted in that aſſembly. We find, by a letter of John de Mervilliers to his nephew, the biſhop of Rennes, ambaſſador to the court of Vienna, dated from Fontainebleau the third of March, that "As ſoon as the cardinal was returned from the council, the preſidents of the parliament and the king's council, were ſummoned to court to ſee the decrees and acts of that aſſembly; and the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debated, the attorney general ſaid, That with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the doctrine, the parliament did not intend to meddle with it, but held every thing as ſound and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, that was determined in a general and lawful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: but, as for the decrees of diſcipline and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they had found in ſeveral things, derogatory to the rights and privileges of the Gallican church, and therefore to be rejected
<note n="*" place="bottom">Henault, abridged by Nugent, p. i. p. 416.</note>."</p>
                  <p>Further means for promoting the grand point of the pope's ſupremacy, were the inquiſition of Italy, the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, the Miſſions prohibiting books, and other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to diveſt all temporal ſovereigns from any juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in ſpiritual affairs. — Theſe things ſufficiently ſhew the pope's deſign to erect an univerſal ſupremacy; yet, in the exerciſe of it; the pope's hands have been tied by the cardinals and congregations. — This power ſeemed to increaſe, and the popes became more and more ſhackled, which no pope better underſtood than Sixtus V. who firſt conceived that proteſtantiſm might accidentally be turned to the advantage of the pope; but this project was defeated by the general conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Europe, the pragmatic ſanction.</p>

                  <p>In this century we find the popes have been more concerned for the preſervation than the increaſe of their power and authority, and they ſeem to have been thoroughly ſenſible of the neceſſity of ſuch conduct.</p>
                  <p>Their ſpiritual monarchy, in its external limits, has, doubtleſs, been rather contracted then extended, though the perſecutions of the proteſtants in Germany, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, and France, have not indeed been totally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect. The ſeveral acceſſions of great princes to the church of Rome have not been detrimental to the pope; and the miſſions, among the heathens and Eaſtern nations, have unqueſtionably contributed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the propagation of the Romiſh faith.</p>
                  <p>But it would be no difficulty to ſhew, that all theſe means have been far from anſwering their end in the manner expected; that the endeavours uſed for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the proteſtants under the old yoke, eſpecially in England, have miſcarried; that the proteſtants, by a cloſer union, and the progreſſive increaſe of their power, have gradually, in effect, weakened Roman ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic houſes; and the propagation of popery has been not a little reſtrained by public laws

                  <p>It is only in the writings of the bigots of Rome, and in the proſſeſſorial chains of the Jeſuits, that the inward conſtitution of this ſupremacy remains unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; for if, inſtead of looking into the Roman cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm for what ought to take place, we conſider the actual ſtate of things, we muſt admit the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Monſieur Voltaire, though made ſome time ſince, "That in the opinion of the great, at leaſt, the infallibility of the pope, with the power founded in it, is a chimera, not believed even at Rome, and yet

                  <p>The juſtice of this idea of the pope and his infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility appears from all the tranſactions with the crowns of France, Spain, Sardinia, Naples, the republic of Venice, and even the houſe of Auſtria.</p>
                  <p>It is ſtill more evident, that in church affairs, and even in caſes relating to the perſons of eccleſiaſtics and church-lands, the temporal princes and ſtates have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and aſſerted their ancient rights; that in France thoſe obnoxious decrees of the councils of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Baſil have not been admitted as articles of fsith; that the papal bulls are no further ſubmitted to, than as they correſpond with the prevailing maxims of the ſtate; that, on theſe accounts, the popes are very cautious of hazarding a deciſion in doctrinal controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; that none prove more refractory ſons of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man father than the Jeſuits, when his will and their's happen to claſh.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0010800101:254"/>of Madrid and Rome, than at Verſailles or any other court.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to doctrine and ceremonies, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the council of Trent adjuſted matters of this nature, for the moſt part, not only by decrees of the council, but in all difficult matters referred to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deciſion of the pope; yet we find, very early in this century, many diſputes were agitated, viz. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy concerning grace and free-will, held at Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain before Clement VIII. and Paul V. the pope publiſhed a decree in 1611, by which he ordered, that nothing ſhould be publiſhed, relating to theſe matters, upon any pretence whatſoever. This decree was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by Urban VIII. 1625, but thoſe prohibitions had no effect; for there appeared a variety of treatiſes of both ſides upon theſe matters.</p>
                  <p>Another diſpute was revived concerning eccleſiaſtical and political authority. This was chiefly managed between the lawyers and the divines. It was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the pope's interdict of the republic of Venice, and was calculated to maintain, on one hand, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the ſenate, to make ſuch laws as concerned the civil ſtate of that republic; and that the pope had no right to publiſh an interdict on that account. This diſpute terminated in favour of the rights of princes, in oppoſition to the pretended authority of the pope.</p>
                  <p>Janſeniſm prevailed greatly in France about the middle of this century, which occaſioned three aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the clergy at Paris, in 1653, 1654, and 1655, who drew up a formulary, in order to terminate the diſpute, which was confirmed by the king's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus.</p>
                  <p>Another diſpute in this century was concerning the frequency of receiving the communion, which was managed with ſome warmth, but admitted of no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory deciſion.</p>
                  <p>But a controverſy of more importance took place about the year 1680, between the clergy of France
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0010800101:255"/>and the court of Rome, about the regale. The regale is a right, by which the king enjoys the revenues of the archbiſhoprics and biſhoprics of the kingdom, and confers benefices during the vacancy of the ſees, till ſuch time as the incumbent has taken the oath of allegiance; and this the king claimed as a right that did belong to him univerſally throughout his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, except two or three provinces. Pope Innocent XI. ſeemed determined to oppoſe his claim: at length, in 1681, was held a national council, or general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the clergy, to regulate this diſpute, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his majeſty's right of the regale over all churches of the kingdom, and compriſed the whole matter in four articles: 1. That kings and princes are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the eccleſiaſtical power, as to their temporals. 2. That the decrees of the council of Conſtance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the authority of general councils, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in full force and virtue. 3. That the uſe of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical power ought to be moderated by the canons. 4. That, although the ſovereign pontiff has the firſt place in matters of faith, though his decrees regard all churches, and each church in particular, yet his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not infallible, unleſs it be followed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the church.

                  <head>CENTURY THE EIGHTEENTH.</head>
                  <p>The hiſtory of this century we ſhall attempt in a general way, by enquiring a little further into the nature of the papal power, the prerogatives and influence of this ſpiritual monarchy, as it was exerciſed immediately preceding the reformation, and which the preſent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that church direct and countenance them in the exerciſe of.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider, that the popes riſe to that dignity from very inferior ſtations, were heretofore frequently, and are ſtill ſometimes, of mean families, without any
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0010800101:256"/>ſupport from kindred or relations, deriving a great part of their revenues from the ſubjects of other princes, and this in virtue of their claiming a greater ſhare in their allegiance, exerciſing an authority grounded only in opinion, and frequently aſſuming a ſuperiority over thoſe, to whom they have not been themſelves in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; when this is duly conſidered, we cannot help wondering, that this eccleſiaſtical empire has ſtood ſo long, grown up to ſo great a height, and continues yet to enjoy a green old age, that does not ſeem to betray any ſymptoms of a ſpeedy diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>But, upon a nearer and cloſer inſpection, we ſhall find, that this ſpiritual monarchy, like ſome of the leaning towers that have been ſo famous in hiſtory, tho' it ſeems to carry evident marks of weakneſs, is, in fact, a ſtructure very ſtrong in itſelf, contrived with great ſkill, as well as erected with much art. If in other monarchies princes have pretended to a divine right, the pope goes ſtill further, and claims a kind of divine power, by which he is raiſed as much above other princes, as thoſe princes are above their people. This claim, together with the title of Holineſs, having the recommendation of a long preſcription, cannot but excite an high veneration in the minds of ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, the papal character being given with the greateſt ceremony, by thoſe who are preſumed to be the beſt judges of religion; and the religious intereſt ſeem, in the opinion of the multitude, to alter the very nature of him who is adorned therewith, and to transform him, from a man of like paſſions with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, into a ſacred perſon. It is true, that, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant countries, as nothing of this is believed, ſo it is very hard to be underſtood; yet the fact is beyond diſpute: and, whatever wiſer perſons in popiſh king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms may conceive, the bulk of the people have the higheſt reverence for the holy father.</p>
                  <p>The cloſe connection between the clergy in all popiſh countries and the court of Rome, joined to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional benefits that monarchs themſelves may receive by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0010800101:257"/>bulls from the holy ſee, makes them unwilling to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe or break off that commerce which their ſubjects have with Rome, that, upon certain occaſions, they may derive favours from thence, which may eaſily procure what otherwiſe might with difficulty be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by their own authority. The ſubjection of the clergy to a foreign head, makes them ſometimes more tractable to their natural ſovereigns than they otherwiſe would be, ſince the good-will and friendſhip of a ſingle perſon is more eaſily attained than the direction of many; and beſides, in thoſe caſes, there can be no appeal to the people; becauſe, in all ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, they think an entire ſubmiſſion the duty of the clergy. We may add to this another reaſon, which is, that the popiſh princes cheriſh the ſpiritual power of the pope, as the means of preſerving unity in religious diſputes, which very ſeldom diſturb the church without diſturbing the ſtate alſo. Thus it appears that, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of enthuſiaſm and ſuperſtition, political prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples have no ſmall ſhare in promoting that adherence to the ſee of Rome, which, at firſt ſight, ſeems ſo irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable to the abſolute authority of ſovereign princes, and which, notwithſtanding, by their dexterous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, is often made to co-operate therewith.</p>
                  <p>As to the interior ſtrength of the papal government, we need only reflect, that the advantages of birth are well ſupplied by the great parts, and other qualifications, with which a man muſt be neceſſarily endowed, who is promoted to this dignity. His being obliged to celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy is another point of great conſequence, inaſmuch as it prevents the changing this elective into an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary ſovereignty, which would be entirely repugnant to the fundamental maxims of this conſtitution. We may add to this, the precautions taken in electing a perſon far advanced in years, which leaves no room for attempting to alter the ſettled principles of the government; and all great politicians allow, that it is the ſacrificing theſe to the intereſt of a family, or to the private advantage of the reigning prince, that opens a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0010800101:258"/>way to the ruin of the beſt-digeſted ſyſtems. It has alſo been an old rule in the conclave, never to elect two popes of the ſame family or faction, or even of the ſame diſpoſition, in immediate ſucceſſion, for the ſame reaſon. In ſhort, it would be endleſs to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate particulars; but the character of the church of Rome, in reſpect to policy, has always ſtood ſo high, as to be thought the beſt ſchool for training miniſters in all the popiſh monarchies, from whence alſo it draws great advantages.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not, however, imagine from hence, that becauſe the fundamental maxims of the ſee of Rome have been always the ſame, the adminiſtration of the government has been exactly uniform, ſince, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vaſt variations in mens temper's and habits in different ages, this muſt appear a thing abſolutely impoſſible: neither ought we to imagine, that any conſtitution could be ſo framed, as to extinguiſh in the minds of princes all natural regard to their families: but on the one hand, ſuch has been the ſkill and capacity of theſe ſpiritual monarchs, that from time to time they have made ſuch prudent alterations in their exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior conduct, as hath perfectly kept up that relation between the church and the court of Rome, upon which their authority depends: they have likewiſe, on the other, reduced their family tenderneſſes into a kind of ſyſtem, by which the nepotiſm of the Roman pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs has been in many reigns ſubſervient to the intereſt of the ſtate, as well as agreeable to the inclination of the popes, who thought they could never truſt their affairs in ſo ſafe hands for themſelves, as with thoſe who muſt be conſcious, that their wealth, their influence, and their power, muſt, in a great meaſure, determine with the life of him from whom they were received, and that, beſides, they muſt, from that moment, lie open to the ſtricteſt enquiries poſſible into their paſt conduct.</p>
                  <p>One may, with great truth and impartiality, venture to aſſert, that the whole ſcheme of the Romiſh religion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0010800101:259"/>is admirably well adjuſted to maintain, in every reſpect, the power of the ſupreme head: he is reputed infallible, that his deciſions may have the greater weight: the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the church, which, with the members of it, paſs for a rule of faith, are ſubject to his controul; all religious doctrines are liable to his cenſure; the power of abſolution, even in the higheſt caſes, is attributed to him; he diſpenſes the treaſures of the church, I mean ſpiritual treaſures, ſuch as pardons and indulgences; he grants diſpenſations of all kinds; he regulates faſts and feaſts at his pleaſure: in a word, being reputed the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of St. Peter, and the viſible head of the Chriſtian church, he has prerogatives without bounds, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number; ſo that it is no ſurpriſing thing at all, that ſo much power, directed by ſo great policy, ſhould be able to perform ſuch mighty things, and to preſerve it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ſo many ages.</p>
                  <p>But our eſtimate of this power would be extremely imperfect, if we did not take notice of the ſeveral ranks and orders of men ſubject, in an eſpecial manner, to the holy ſee; and which, without any great impropriety in the term, may be ſtyled the ſpiritual forces of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In the firſt claſs of theſe ſtand the cardinals, who are acknowledged princes of the church, and pretend to the next in dignity to crowned heads; they were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally no more than the pariſh prieſts of Rome, and their number ſometimes greater, ſometimes leſs; but now it is fixed to ſeventy-two, in alluſion to Chriſt's diſciples: heretofore a cardinal was content to be ſtyled his excellency; but now they aſſume the title of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, which was formerly given to princes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the latter took the title of highneſs; the cardinals are of all nations, that the influence ariſing from the hopes of this dignity may be the more extenſive: the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hats by crowned heads is a new ſtroke of Romiſh policy, which heightens the dependence upon the holy ſee, while it ſeems to leſſen the papal authority; the majority, however, are chiefly Italians, to prevent the throne from being filled by a ſtranger; and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0010800101:260"/>that in all elections the perſon choſen ſhall have the voices of two thirds of thoſe who enter the conclave, that there may never be a ſtrong faction againſt the pope amongſt the cardinals, which might be attended with ill conſequences. All the ſubordinate dignities of the church may be conſidered as the nobility in the pope's ſpiritual empire.</p>
                  <p>But as in all others, ſo in this, the ſtrength of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy conſiſts in the number of its ſubjects; and if we take into our view the ſecular and regular clergy in the church of Rome, the former bound by the moſt ſacred ties, and the latter not by vows only, but by their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts to the obedience of the holy ſee, we cannot but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a high opinion of its power; ſince long ago it was the calculation of a certain ſovereign, that in Europe he had three hundred thouſand pariſhes, and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand convents, ſubject to his juriſdiction, who, more or leſs, upon different occaſions, reſort to Rome, and carry thither an immenſe treaſure. And it is very eaſy to diſcern, that nothing has been neglected which could poſſibly contribute to render the foundations of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy firm and ſtrong: the moſt important truſt of educating youth is entirely in their hands who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the ſervice of the holy ſee; the Jeſuits are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly famous for their application in this reſpect, and when they have received the firſt tincture of literature, ſuch as are ſent to compleat their ſtudies at the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, meet with the ſame doctrine and diſcipline; and whatever the ſcience be to which they apply, venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the pope is a thing ſo frequently inſiſted on, and ſo ſtrongly impreſſed, that it is almoſt impoſſible they ſhould ever loſe it while they remain at thoſe ſeminaries of learning, and attend the offices of the church. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, the number of inferior clergy, who enjoy eccleſiaſtical benefices of all ſorts, are ſo numerous, and afford ſuch ample maintenance, and ſuch agreeable proſpects to men of all ranks and tempers, in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the canon law, which is peculiar to this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual monarchy, that the moſt effectual proviſion is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0010800101:261"/>made for a conſtant ſucceſſion of perſons, bound to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that intereſt, which is the ſupport of themſelves and all their pretenſions.</p>
                  <p>As theſe are bound by affection, and by finding their own account, to a conſtant ſubmiſſion, ſo the proper methods have been taken for ſubjecting the laics in that church alſo to ſuch an obedience as they cannot well break through. Amongſt theſe we may reckon auricular confeſſion, maſſes for the dead, the direction of female conſciences, the opportunities they have of working upon perſons in their dying moments; and many more circumſtances that might be mentioned, favourable to their intereſt, afford us a reaſonable probability that the papal authority will not decline much more than it has already done, eſpecially if ſucceeding popes imitate the moderation of their immediate predeceſſors, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſupport their influence rather by addreſs than by the force of eccleſiaſtical cenſures, which is a ſort of artillery that no longer does the execution it did in the darker ages, when the little learning there was remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed entirely among the prieſts and the monks.</p>
                  <p>The reader will apprehend this more clearly, if he takes a ſhort view of the European powers, that ſtill profeſs obedience to the ſee of Rome. In Poland the clergy are numerous and well provided for, having a great ſhare of power allotted them by the conſtitution, and are for the moſt part compoſed of the younger ſons of the nobility.—In Germany it is viſible, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh religion rather prevails than declines, and the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical electors and other prelates are ſo formidable a body in the diet, as not to be apprehenſive of any future ſecularizations. It is, beſides, the intereſt of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great houſes to ſupport the church, as it is now conſtituted, on the ſcore of the preferments, which are in a manner entailed on the younger ſons of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſo as not only to afford them noble eſtabliſhments, but alſo render them capable of ſupporting the head of their houſe, inſtead of being a burthen upon him, as would be the caſe if thoſe dignities were ſecularized.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0010800101:262"/>—The hereditary countries of the houſe of Auſtria re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtrictly attached to the ſee of Rome.—The French, or Gallican church has, indeed, always claimed a kind of freedom, which having been improved by the ſtruggles that have been heretofore made againſt them, the modern popes have wiſely had recourſe to another method, which ſeems to have had a better effect, and whilſt the courts of Rome and Verſailles agree, both will find their account in the reciprocal ſupport of each other's power.—In Spain and Portugal the papal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſtands upon a much ſtronger foundation, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the amazing wealth of the clergy in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the joy with which the ſovereign of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accepted very lately, from the pope, the title of <hi>Moſt Faithful,</hi> (conferred by a bull from the pope, Jan. 1749) as well as many inſtances of a ſuperſtitious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the doctrines and practices of that church.— In Italy the influence of the pope extends every where, and he is ſo able to make either his favour or his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure felt, that all the princes and ſtates of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, find it their intereſt to live upon good terms with his holineſs, and as none underſtand their own intereſt better, are like to continue in the ſame incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, received from their anceſtors, in that reſpect.</p>
                  <p>It has been generally ſuppoſed, that one of the maxims of the ſee of Rome has been, attaching itſelf to the ſuperior intereſt, and always courting that power moſt which is uppermoſt; and, in proof of this, much has and may be ſaid: but at the ſame time it is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the true intereſt of the holy ſee conſiſts in ſupporting the balance of power, becauſe its influence depends chiefly upon an equality among the princes of that communion; and if any of theſe ſhould gain an entire aſcendency, the ſee of Rome could not fail of feeling the firſt effects of it. This is not only evident in ſpeculation, but from experience likewiſe.—The truth is, that while the court of Rome continues famous for policy, we can never expect her falling from this maxim; for as, in decency, it imports the holy
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0010800101:263"/>father to ſhew an equal affection for all who profeſs themſelves his children, whereby he may beſt ſecure their reciprocal affection, duty and confidence
<note n="*" place="bottom">Abſtract from the preſent State of Europe, p. 423.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Theſe points may be further illuſtrated, were we to conſider his temporal authority, which the Roman pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff enjoys in conſequence of his dominions in Italy and elſewhere. He is lord of conſiderable territories, and poſſeſſed of gold and ſilver, which St. Peter, even admitting him to have been biſhop of Rome, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did not bequeath to the ſee. What the dominions of the pope are, what his revenues and riches, nor whether theſe are lawful poſſeſſions, is not my province to enquire. It is not only probable, but unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that theſe are more the ſupport of his ſupremacy and authority in the church, than any real perſuaſion of his infalibillity and divine right; though to eſtabliſh ſuch ſentiments hath been made the ſtudy and buſineſs of the Jeſuits.</p>
                  <p>1713. Pope Clement XI. was prevailed with by the Jeſuits at Paris, to iſſue the bull Unigenitus, which chiefly relates to points of diſpute between the Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts and the Dominicans, and for eſtabliſhing the pope's authority. This bull, beſides being an evidence that the pope may err, both in matters of faith and hiſtorical facts, proved the means of greatly endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authority of the pope; it kindled a flame in France which ſpread over the whole Romiſh church: broke out more violently after the death of Lewis XIV. The new king of Sicily would not part with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; and the zeal which the pope manifeſted, ſerved only to increaſe the papal penſioners, among whom was now the Pretender, as he could no longer ſtay in France; for the bull, which begins with the paſtoral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, made no impreſſions in France; and from the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſition that was made to it, not only in France, but in the Low Countries and Germany, he found it neceſſary to uſe his beſt efforts in its defence; but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0010800101:264"/>finding himſelf unequal to the taſk, he conſented at length to ſome overtures.</p>
                  <p>Benedict XIII. diſcovered a more pacific diſpoſition, and was much diſappointed in the great good he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Jeſuits; for he found them more active in ſupport of the bull Unigenitus than he could have wiſhed. However, notwithſtanding cardinal de Noailles, and cardinal Fleury, &amp;c. ſubſcribed it, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict always continued a ſtaunch Dominican. He pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the bull Petioſus, which the Jeſuits will hardly admit to be a juſt expoſition of the doctrine of grace. We muſt not omit this pope's pacific diſpoſition, to reconcile the Roman, Greek, Lutheran, and reformed parties; and is more famous for perſonal endowments, eſpecially learning, than for the proſperity of his pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate.</p>
                  <p>The intrigues and claſhings among the ſeveral Roman catholic courts, and the ambitious ſchemes of the cardinals (who now obtained the title of Eminences), the artifice and induſtry of the Jeſuits and other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of prieſts, ſerved to weaken the power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the popes. The occurrences of latter times convince us, that the meaſures, particularly of the Jeſuits, rendered them ſuſpected of being ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the emiſſaries of the pope, as to diſturb the peace and tranquillity of kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>The late extirpations of the order of Jeſuits, in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal and in France, are undeniable proofs that the pope's authority is no longer abſolute, but limited and reſtrained, where the Jeſuits have attempted an undue influence, or their principles, and their numbers, riches, and unconſtitutional meaſures, have been found inconvenient, or prejudicial to the civil ſtate of the kingdom.</p>
                  <p>In latter times the progreſs of arts and ſciences, and of learning in general, may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be a very conſiderable means of limiting that unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed power and authority of the pope, ſo long uſurped, and to weaken and deſtroy ſuch attempts as were made
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0010800101:265"/>upon the rights of princes; and at the ſame time to remove that unreaſonable ſuperſtition that too generally prevailed in the minds of the common people for whatever had the ſanction of papal authority; and this is equally applicable to thoſe errors and corruptions in doctrine, worſhip, and ceremonies, that have in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time prevailed in that church; many of the groſſeſt of them ſprung up in the darkeſt and moſt barbarous ages of chriſtianity, when learning degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into fabulous legends and monkiſh ſtories, when to underſtand Greek, and other languages, was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and to believe the Antipodes was eſteemed hereſy; then was the time to impoſe on an undiſcerning age, and to obtrude upon their underſtanding the belief of miracles performed by the relics of departed ſaints, and many doctrines, ſuch as purgatory, tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, &amp;c. which are not only unſcriptural, but repugnant both to reaſon and common ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>In the two laſt centuries the increaſe of knowledge, hath produced various effects among perſons of different ranks: thoſe, whoſe intereſt or prepoſſeſſions have not rendered them the friends and abettors of papal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and impoſitions on the conſciences of men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der various pretenſions, and have ſeen the inconſiſtency of many of their doctrines, practices, and ceremonies, with genuine Chriſtianity, have paid only an external regard to their ceremonies, to avoid eccleſiaſtical or civil penalties: ſome have looked with indifference on all the outward forms and modes of religion, whilſt many have fallen into direct infidelity; and deiſm is now too general among the politer part of the inhabitants both in Italy and France.</p>
                  <p>This may ſuffice as a preliminary to the preſent ſtate of religion in the church of Rome, conſtitution, doctrine, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>But though this is in general admitted, we ought here to obſerve, there are diverſity of ſentiments with reſpect to veſting this power ſolely in the perſon of the pope. The Jeſuits, and almoſt all the ſeveral orders of monks, in Italy, profeſs to believe, I.

               <p>The CANON law is a collection of eccleſiaſtical conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, deciſions, and maxims, taken partly from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, partly from the ancient councils, and partly from the decrees of popes, and the reports and the ſayings of the primitive fathers, whereby all matters of polity in the Romiſh church are regulated.</p>
               <p>The common law, that obtained throughout the Weſt till the twelfth century, was the collection of canons made by Dionyſius Exiguus in 520; the capitularies of Charlemaign, and the decrees of the popes from Sircius
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0010800101:271"/>to Anaſtaſius.—No regard was had to any thing not compriſed in theſe; and the French ſtill maintain the rights of the Gallican church to conſiſt in their not being obliged to admit any thing elſe; but to be at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to reject all innovations made in the canonical juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence ſince that compilation, as well as all papal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees before Sircius.</p>
               <p>Indeed, between the eighth and eleventh centuries, the canon law was mixed and confounded with the papal decrees from St. Clement to Sircius, which till then had been unknown: this gave occaſion to a new reform or body of the canon law, which is the collection ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant under the title of the Concordance of the Diſcarding Canons, made in 1151, by Gratian, a Benedictine monk, from texts of ſcripture, councils, and ſentiments of the fathers in the ſeveral points of eccleſiaſtical polity. This work he divided according to the order of matters, not of times and councils, as had been done before; ſo that, upon the appearance of this, all the ancient col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections immediately ſunk.—It is divided into three parts; the firſt into an hundred and eight diſtinctions; the ſecond into thirty-ſix cauſes, and the third into five diſtinct parts: the ſecond part of the canon law conſiſts of the decrees of the popes from 1150, to pope Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry IX. in 1229.</p>
               <p>In 1297, pope Boniface continued the papal decrees as far as his time: this part the French make particular exception to, by reaſon of that pope's differences with their king, Philip the Fair. To theſe pope John XXII. added the Clementines, or the five books of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of his predeceſſor Clement V. And to all theſe were after added twenty conſtitutions of the ſaid pope John, called the Extravagantes; and ſome other conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of his ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>All theſe compoſe the body, or corpus, of the canon law, to this time, which, including the comments, makes (three volumes in folio) the rule and meaſure of church government
<note n="*" place="bottom">Chambers's Dictionary.</note>. There are a variety of other collections of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0010800101:272"/>the canons and decrees of councils, which make up the body of the canon law; which canons and eccleſiaſtical laws it is the buſineſs and profeſſion of the canoniſts, or eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical lawyers, to ſtudy, explain, and apply with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs; and to vindicate their authority, and maintain an inviolable regard to them, by all the ſanctions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them.</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe eccleſiaſtical laws and canons, which are the bulwark of the conſtitution of the Romiſh church, there are other inſtitutions of that church more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially calculated for preſerving an uniformity of faith among Chriſtians. Theſe formularies or creeds are chiefly three, viz. that called the Apoſtles, of which we have given account, p. 30; the Nicene, p. 41; and the Athanaſian, p. 56, of which a repetition is unneceſſary. I ſhall only obſerve, that the Nicene creed has been ever held in great eſteem by that church, and conſtitutes the firſt twelve articles of that ultimate rule of their faith and practice, pope Pius IV. creed.</p>
               <p>The creed itſelf contains the ſubſtance of the decrees and canons of the council of Trent, and being uſually divided into twenty-four articles, is ſo plauſible as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the firſt twelve in the very words of that creed called the Nicene, the greateſt part of which moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtants profeſs to believe and acknowledge: but there is this great difference, as was before obſerved, between the manner wherein the Nicene creed is impoſed in popiſh countries, and wherein they, who adhere to true proteſtant principles, receive it, or any part of it; that the one require it to be received upon an equal footing with the holy ſcriptures; the other believe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the things contained in it, not becauſe the fathers of the Nicene council ſo believed and ſo decreed; but becauſe they apprehend, that the things themſelves are contained in the holy ſcriptures, and ſo far only as they are therein contained; ſo that their faith is ultimately reſolved into the word of God, and not into the commandments of men: herein they aſſert their liberty as becomes proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

               <p>The orthodox faith does not depend upon the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures conſidered abſolutely in themſelves, but as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by catholic tradition.

               <p>It may here be proper to obſerve the manner in which the articles of pope Pius's creed are connected with thoſe of the Nicene. The Nicene creed makes mention of one holy catholic and apoſtolic church; and the creed of pope Pius begins with a profeſſion of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and embracing the traditions, &amp;c. of the ſame church; inſinuating that all the traditions of the church of Rome are traditions of the one holy catholic and apoſtolic church: and it is certain, that the Romaniſts do pretend, that all theſe characters belong to their church, and to that alone; they make themſelves the whole church of Chriſt, and exclude all others from being ſo much as a part of it; they confine holineſs to themſelves, and confidently affirm, that their church alone is derived from the apoſtles

               <p>The papiſts define penance to be, "A ſacrament conſiſting in ſome outward ſign or ceremony, by which grace is given to the ſoul of the worthy receiver, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt when, breathing upon the diſciples, he gave them the Holy Ghoſt to remit and retain ſins; that is, to reconcile the faithful fallen into ſin after baptiſm: it differeth from baptiſm not only in matter and form, but alſo, becauſe the miniſter of baptiſm is not a judge in that ordinance; whereas after baptiſm the ſinner preſents himſelf before the tribunal of the prieſt as guilty, to be ſet at liberty by his ſentence: — it is, however, as neceſſary as baptiſm: the form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the words, "I do abſolve thee." Contrition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and ſatisfaction, are parts of penance, and the effect of it is reconciliation with God.—Contrition is grief of mind for ſins committed with purpoſe to ſin no more, and was ever neceſſary at all times, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſuch as ſin after baptiſm: it is a preparation

               <p>The church of Rome requires that due worſhip and veneration be given to them, ſuch as kiſſing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the head, and falling down before them, and denounces a curſe againſt thoſe who think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

<note n="*" place="bottom">* Grounds of the Catholic Doctrine, p. 37, 38.</note>, What is the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic doctrine touching the veneration and invocation of ſaints?</p>
               <p>The anſwer is, We are taught, 1ſt, That there is an honour and veneration due to the angels and ſaints; 2d, That they offer prayers to God for us; 3d, That it is good and profitable to invoke them, that is, to have recourſe to their interceſſion and prayers; 4th, That their relics are to be had in veneration.</p>

                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0010800101:298"/>When the reaſon of it is aſked, the anſwer is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the church, in all ages, has paid this honour and veneration to the ſaints, by erecting churches and keeping holidays in their memory: a practice which the Engliſh proteſtants have alſo retained.</p>
               <p>The church, ſays Boſſuet, in his Expoſition on the Creed, in telling of us, that it is beneficial to pray to the ſaints, teaches us to pray to them in that ſpirit of charity, and according to that order of brotherly love, which inclines us to requeſt the aſſiſtance of our brethren living upon earth; and the catechiſm of the council of Trent teaches us to beg of them to be our advocates, only uſing this phraſe, <hi>Pray for us.</hi> And in vindication of this their ſentiment and practice they alledge, that the church of England ſtill retains this collect upon the day of St. Michael and All Angels: "O! everlaſting God, who haſt ordained and conſtituted the ſervice of angels in a wonderful order, mercifully grant, that as thy holy angels always do thee ſervice in heaven, ſo by thy appointment they may ſuccour and defend us on earth

               <p>Art. XXI. <hi>I do firmly believe that the images of Chriſt, of the bleſſed Virgin, the mother of God, and of other ſaints, ought to be had and retained, and that due honour and veneration ought to be paid unto them</hi>

               <p>The miniſter ſhall teach the people, that images of ſaints are to be placed in churches, that they may be likewiſe worſhipped
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cat. ad Paroch. part iii. ſect. 4.</note>. If any doubt ariſes about the meaning of the word Worſhip, when applied to images, he, the miniſter, ſhall teach them, that images were made to inſtruct them in the hiſtory of both Teſtaments, and to refreſh their memories; for being excited by the remembrance of divine things, they excite more ſtrongly to worſhip God himſelf
<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>It muſt be owned, that the papiſts contend, that images are not to be worſhipped as God; and that you
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0010800101:299"/>are not to imagine there is divinity in them. The honour, or worſhip, they ſay, is to be referred to the prototype; and with reſpect to the virgin Mary, they are not charged with worſhipping her, or putting their truſt in her, as much as in God, but, ſtrictly ſpeaking, with paying her divine worſhip. The breviaries are full of examples of ſuch honours paid to her. In the little office of the bleſſed Mary, ſhe is deſired to looſe the bonds of the guilty—drive away evils from us— demand all good things for us—make us chaſte—pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect us from the enemy—receive us at the hour of death. She is ſet forth in the expreſs language of their liturgies, miſſals, and breviaries at Rome, as the mother of mercy, hope of the world, and the only truſt of ſinners; and the ſaints addreſſed under the title of interceſſors, protectors, and diſpenſers of grace.</p>
               <p>Biſhop Stillingfleet ſays, the council of Nice defined true and real worſhip to be given to images, i. e. that images were not only to be ſigns and helps to memory, to call to mind, and repreſent to us, the object of worſhip, but that the acts of worſhip were to be paid to the images themſelves. The former uſe of images doth ſuppoſe them to be only of the nature of books, which repreſent things to our minds, without any act of adoration performed to that, which is only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of intellection, although the thing repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the mind be a proper object of adoration

But thoſe who go no farther ſtand condemned and anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized by the ſecond council of Nice. For images are not only to be placed in temples, but alſo to be worſhipped as if the perſons repreſented thereby were preſent

               <p>All the devotion paid to their ſaints extends no farther than to deſire their prayers, and that the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and images of them, which we ſee in their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0010800101:300"/>churches, are no more than mere memorials, deſigned to expreſs the eſteem which they retain for the perſons ſo repreſented, or as helps to raiſe their affections to heavenly things, and that every child amongſt them knows this to be true

               <p>Art. XXII. <hi>I do affirm, that the power of indulgences was left by Chriſt in the church, and that the uſe of them is very beneficial to Chriſtian people</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pope Pius's Creed, art. xxii.</note>.</p>
               <p>The council of Trent propoſes nothing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to indulgences, according to Monſ. Boſſuet; but that the church had the power of granting them from Jeſus Chriſt, and that the practice of them is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; which cuſtom, that council adds, ought ſtill to be preſerved, though with moderation, leſt eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical diſcipline ſhould be weakened by too great a toleration.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How do you prove theſe propoſitions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By the unanimous conſent of the fathers, and the tradition of the church, the biſhops of Rome are the ſucceſſors of St. Peter, who tranſlated his chair from Antioch to Rome, and died biſhop of Rome. Hence the ſee of Rome, in all ages, is called the ſee of Peter, the chair of Peter, and abſolutely the ſee apoſtolic; and in that quality has, from the beginning, exerciſed juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over all other churches, as appears from the beſt records of ancient church hiſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why do you call the Romiſh church the mother and miſtreſs of all churches?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe her biſhop is St. Peter's ſucceſſor, and Chriſt's vicar upon earth, and conſequently the father and paſtor of all the faithful; and therefore this church, as being St. Peter's ſee, is the mother and miſtreſs of all churches.</p>
               <p>Under this explanation we find the belief of it declared to be neceſſary to ſalvation. So ſays the concluſion of this creed, confirmed by pope Pius V. And to the ſame purpoſe, Boniface VIII. in his canon law, aſſerts and decrees; "Moreover we declare, and ſay, and define, and pronounce to every human creature, that it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary to ſalvation, to be ſubject to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pontiff

               <p>Though it is not immediately under my notice to examine the real merit of tranſubſtantiation, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this article with the mention of one argument, urged by the catholic Chriſtians for it, which, if it has any force, muſt be allowed indeed to be concluſive. "That the unerring authority of the church has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to be true, and enjoined the belief of it, (and

               <p>Art. XXIV. <hi>I do undoubtedly receive and profeſs all others things that have been delivered, defined, by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred canons and oecumenical councils, and eſpecially by the holy ſynod of Trent, and all other things contrary hereunto; and all hereſies condemned, rejected, and anathematized, by the church, I do likewiſe condemn, reject, and anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This bull (as they call it) bears date on the ides of November 1564, and concludes in the uſual manner, with threats of the indignation of God, and of his bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed apoſtles St. Peter and St. Paul, againſt all that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe or oppoſe it.</p>
               <p>And every reader, I ſuppoſe, diſcerns, that this is not merely a confeſſion of faith, but likewiſe a ſolemn oath; and ſo the title of it bears, <hi>A bull concerning the form of an oath of profeſſion of faith;</hi> which faith all eccleſiaſtical perſons, whether ſecular or regular, as they diſtinguiſh them, and all military orders, are obliged to take—As follows: "This true catholic faith, without which no one can be ſaved, which at this preſent time I do, of my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, profeſs, and ſincerely hold, I, the ſame N. N. do promiſe and vow, and ſwear, God aſſiſting me, moſt conſtantly to retain and confeſs, entire and unviolated, to the laſt breath of my life, and ſo far as in me lies. I will likewiſe take care, that it ſhall be held, taught, and preached by my ſubjects, or thoſe the care of whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to me, in the diſcharge of my office."—And it is as eaſy to obſerve, that this is perfectly new, both as an oath and as a profeſſion of faith, never was there any ſuch creed impoſed before, or ſo much as framed, much leſs tied upon men by an oath. For when theſe fathers met at Trent, and were to make a profeſſion of faith by rehearſing the creed, which the Roman church uſes,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0010800101:304"/>ſo the words are
<note n="*" place="bottom">Seſſ. 3.</note>, they could find none to profeſs, but the Nicene creed: no larger creed was in uſe, no, not even in the Roman church; but theſe very men, who afterwards turned new creed-makers, were forced to be content with that.</p>
               <p>Though this creed is aſſerted to be the true catholic faith, it is in no ſenſe catholic, as to place, nor time; for it was no where uſed till they made it, no not there, nor is now every where believed, and was not, in the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional articles to the Nicene creed, believed in any church for above 1500 years; nor now uſed in that church itſelf, when they admit members into the catholic church by baptiſm; but they are ſaid to be put into a ſtate of ſalvation, by their profeſſing to believe the Nicene creed alone: which is a direct contradiction to the terms of this creed, wherein are included the doctrines of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, worſhipping images, the ſeven ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, traditions, and other conſtitutions of the Romiſh church, there declared to be neceſſary to ſalvation
<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Patrick's (ſince biſhop of Ely) Pillar and Ground of Faith.</note>.</p>
               <p>The council of Conſtance declares, that they being a general council, lawfully congregated in the Holy Ghoſt, and repreſenting the catholic church, it has power immediately from Chriſt, which every one, of whatſoever ſtate, or dignity, even the papal, is obliged to obey in things appertaining to faith, &amp;c. or ſuffer condign puniſhment
<note n="§" place="bottom">Seſſ. v.</note>.</p>
               <p>This creed is peculiarly adapted to the genius and ſpirit of popery, and to the particular views of this council, requiring, <hi>That all things which have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, defined, and declared, by the ſacred canons of this ſynod he received and believed without doubting;</hi> an aſſent ſo full and implicit can ſcarce be complied with by any reaſonable agent. But even this believing is not enough; if you do not condemn and anathematize all, that under the character of unbelievers are condemned, and anathematized by the church. And what is the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0010800101:305"/>conſequence of that? Why, if he is a heretic, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the church, he muſt be treated as an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, and ſubjected to all the puniſhments which the church decrees ſhould be inflicted on them

Thus left at the mercy of the prieſt, who for want of receiving ſuch ſatisfaction as he ſhall judge proper, can direct and oblige the magiſtrate to deprive them of ſubſtance and liberty, and even life itſelf.</p>
               <p>The following judicious reflections on pope Pius's creed, by the Rev. Mr. Burroughs, may not be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to our readers. "Let any man, who has ever read the New Teſtament, judge what likeneſs there is, between the doctrine of pope Pius's creed, and that which was taught by our bleſſed Lord and his apoſtles, Nay, let any man of ſober thought, whether he has read the ſcriptures or not, judge whether it is poſſible, that ſuch a religion ſhould ever come from God, as that which the church of Rome tells you is neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of Chriſt and his apoſtles teaches us the higheſt veneration of the one living and true God, the wiſe and righteous and gracious governor of the world, and the moſt ardent affection to him as our beſt friend and benefactor: and directs and encourages us to ſeek of him, with a full aſſurance of faith, every needful bleſſing, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, the only media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and men. It requires of us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and equity in our whole conduct towards thoſe with whom we have to do; and very particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends a mutual forbearance and affectionate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs among Chriſtian brethren, with regard to the miſapprehenſions and miſtakes into which they may fall. And, as any religion muſt do which comes from God, it lays a very great ſtreſs upon a ſober, temperate courſe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0010800101:308"/>of life; excluding from the kingdom of heaven thoſe who allow themſelves in the contrary courſe.</p>
               <p>But in the preceding papers we have ſeen, that the religion of the church of Rome oppoſes that of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in all theſe reſpects, though it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends in every one of them to adhere to it. The papiſts profeſs indeed to acknowledge one only living and true God: yet at the ſame time it is notorious, that they pay more real worſhip and adoration to angels and ſaints, and even to images, than to him. And to keep up this practice, ſuch thoughts are ſuggeſted to the people's minds concerning the divine being, as are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of him, and inconſiſtent with the honour of the one and only mediator, in whoſe name we are directed to addreſs him. Nay, the multiplicity of the prayers themſelves, which are addreſſed to ſaints and angels, begging for their interceſſion, tends to make the people think concerning the kindeſt and moſt benevolent being in the world, that he is almoſt inexorable, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but continual importunity will prevail with him for any favour: whereas the mediation of Chriſt, as ſtated in the New Teſtament, teaches no ſuch thing; but encourages us, ſinners as we are, to go directly to God in <hi>his</hi> name, <hi>in whom</hi> he has declared himſelf to be <hi>well pleaſed.</hi> But this one mediator is by the church of Rome overlooked, in a croud of others of her own making.</p>
               <p>Then, inſtead of a ſtrict regard to righteouſneſs, and ſobriety, the doctrines of indulgences and purgatory, and ſo likewiſe that of abſolution, upon confeſſion and ſatisfaction at the will and pleaſure of the prieſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage all manner of vice and wickedneſs: ſince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe doctrines, a man may buy off any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, if he ſurvives the wicked actions he reſolves upon; or, at the worſt, can have them bought off when he is dead, if he has but money enough to leave behind him.</p>
               <p>As to forbearance and brotherly kindneſs; the church of Rome is a ſworn enemy to theſe Chriſtian virtues.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0010800101:309"/>She will not bear the leaſt deviation from her own tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, decrees, and canons. She makes them all <hi>neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> both in this life, and that which is to come; preſumptuouſly denouncing eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe who do not punctually obſerve and obey them; and cruelly deſtroying ſuch of them as ſhe can get into her own power.</p>
               <p>What good pretenſions the church of Rome has to be the church of Chriſt, ſhe ſhews by ſetting up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head over the church beſides Chriſt, inconſiſtently with his legiſlative authority, and contrary to his own expreſs direction.</p>
               <p>How little value ſhe has for the ſcripture, ſhe ſhews by ſetting up her own traditions upon an equal footing with it. And by the ſame means, and by claiming the ſole authority of interpreting ſcripture, ſhe prevents, as much as in her lies, its being of any uſe to the people, even when they can get a ſight of their Bibles, which for the moſt part is forbidden. She will not ſuffer them to exerciſe their reaſon in judging of that revelation, which ſhe tells them God has given for their direction. No: if you will be a true member of this church, you muſt give up your reaſon, and even the teſtimony of your ſenſes too; as appears notoriouſly in the affair of tranſubſtantiation. And yet it is evident, that our bleſſed Lord himſelf frequently appealed to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſcience of his hearers, concerning the goodneſs and divine original of his doctrine; and always to their ſenſes, as often as he wrought any miracles.</p>
               <p>How deſtructive to all the views of true religion is the ſtreſs which popery lays upon external ſervices, to the neglect of what is inward and pertaining to the conſcience; and how fatally this tends to harden men in their ſins, and to make them reſolve againſt the irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome work of ſubduing ill habits, and labouring after thoſe which are truly good; is too viſible to need a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>
               <p>How abſolutely this corrupt church is reſolved upon maintaining a dominion over mens conſciences, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0010800101:310"/>what cruel meaſures ſhe takes for that purpoſe, has been ſufficiently ſhewn. How contrary this domineering and cruel ſpirit is to the humble and peaceful ſpirit of Chriſtianity, needs no proof, to thoſe who have any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the books of the New Teſtament. And how inconſiſtent it is with the peace of civil government, and even with the ſafety of thoſe, whether governors or people, who refuſe to put themſelves entirely into the prieſts power; is not only evident in the nature of the thing, but notorious from hiſtory, in all thoſe caſes where the prieſts have thought it worth their while to try their ſtrength

               <p>It is farther neceſſary to obſerve, that as the Roman catholics are ſenſible how juſtly theſe articles in their plain and obvious ſenſe are objected to, and cenſured by proteſtants, with the expoſitions and confirmations of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They have endeavoured to evade their literal ſenſe, and to give a more plauſible and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous form of expreſſion in their room. The moſt remarkable piece of this kind is entitled, "A Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Roman Catholics," being a moſt ſolemn declaration of their utter abhorrence of the following tenets, vulgarly laid at their door, printed at London at the beginning of king James's reign, and reprinted in 1743, when an invaſion was deſigned againſt England by the pretender. It was calculated to introduce po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, by making it appear, that popery was not that horrid antichriſtian thing, but in its own nature mild and gentle, and as fair as truth itſelf. The author, and the preſent editor, ſay, that if the enſuing curſes be added to thoſe appointed to be read on the firſt day of Lent, "they will ſeriouſly and heartily anſwer <hi>Amen</hi> to them all."</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Curſed is he that commits idolatry, that prays to images or relicks, or worſhips them for gods.</hi>

               <p>Notwithſtanding the readineſs of the Roman catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics to oblige themſelves to anſwer <hi>Amen</hi> to this curſe, yet it may be worth enquiring how far they are guilty
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0010800101:311"/>of this crime. Idolatry conſiſts in the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of authority and dominion in ſome inviſible being or beings over us, which they have not. If this be attributed to ſaints and angels, it is idolatry.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Curſed is every goddeſs worſhipper, that believes the Virgin Mary to be any more than a creature; that honours her, worſhips her, or puts his truſt in her as much as in God; that believes her above her Son, or that ſhe can in any thing command him.</hi>

               <p>You are not charged with believing the Virgin Mary to be more than a creature, nor with worſhipping her, or putting truſt in her, as much as in God, but with worſhipping her. Whether it be more or leſs, or as much as God, is not the point; but whether ſhe ought at all to be worſhipped. The papiſts are charged with giving undue honour and worſhip to, and truſt in her; an honour which has not the countenance of one ſingle paſſage in ſcripture, much leſs command to do it.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Curſed is he that believes the angels or ſaints in heaven to be his redeemers, that prays to them as ſuch, or that gives God's honour to them, or to any creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>

               <p>I do not, I would not, charge the papiſts with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving angels or ſaints to be their redeemers, nor do I imagine that they pray to them as ſuch; what they are to be charged with is, praying to ſaints, praying to beings who are ſuppoſed ready and able to help them, without any grounds from revelation, without knowing that they have authority over us, without knowing that they can hear us, without knowing that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to help us, or intercede for us.</p>

               <p>In this, as in all the other preceding points, there is an equivocation. May we not word the curſe thus—
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0010800101:312"/>
                  <hi>Curſed is he that worſhips that which before it was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated was bread and wine, and after conſecration ſeems to all our ſenſes to retain the ſubſtance of bread and wine?</hi> If this were the caſe, it would be worſhipping a breaden god. What then is the difference between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated bread, and the ſame bread unconſecrated? You tell us of a change made in the elements by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and that what before was bread is now Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Curſed is he that believes that prieſts can forgive ſins, whether the ſinner repents or no; or that there is any power in earth or heaven that can forgive ſins, without a hearty repentance and ſerious purpoſe of amendment.</hi>

               <p>Reſp. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to this I obſerve, that our author ſuppoſes that prieſts can forgive ſins, if the ſinner does repent; he ſuppoſes likewiſe, that the ſinner is a believer in Chriſt, and that the prieſt can forgive ſuch a ſinner if he repents: now a prieſt that pretends to forgive the ſins of a repenting Chriſtian, aſſumes to himſelf a power or privilege which can never be proved to be given to him. Who can forgive ſins but God alone, againſt whom they are committed? If therefore any prieſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to themſelves a power over Chriſtians to forgive them their ſins, they tranſgreſs the law of Chriſt under the cover of his words, which they pervert to uſes of their own.</p>

               <p>"This curſe, I ſuppoſe, is added by the editor, that it is an article of the catholic faith, to believe that no power on earth can licence men to lye, forſwear, and perjure themſelves, to maſſacre their neighbours, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their native country, on pretence of promoting the catholic cauſe or religion." But this is far from being clear. Suppoſe your neighbour, or thoſe of your native country, to be heretics, what is the catholic faith, or catholic practice, in this caſe? Is it not

The council of Trent did this, when it profeſſed to "receive and reverence all the books of both the Old and New Teſtament, ſince God is the one author of both, and alſo traditions, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to either faith or manners, as if they were dictated either by word of mouth, by Chriſt, or by the Holy Spirit, and preſerved in a conſtant ſucceſſion in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic church." It received them, I ſay, with equal affection of piety and reverence: nay, it pronounced an anathema to all who willingly and wittingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned traditions." Now, if the ſcripture alone, and by itſelf, contains the rule of faith, they who join tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to it to form the rule of faith, undervalues the word of God as not ſufficient of itſelf to give us the rule of faith; and that equal tradition to the ſcriptures
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0010800101:315"/>undervalue the ſcriptures, becauſe they treat human traditions juſt with the ſame regard as they do the word of God.</p>

He may indeed be devout, and liſt up his heart to God, whilſt the prieſt reads ſomething which is not underſtood.

               <p>The point which ſhould be made good by <hi>Papiſts</hi> is, that their ſacraments of <hi>abſolution</hi> and <hi>extreme unction</hi> do not naturally tend to <hi>encourage ſins,</hi> and lead men to <hi>defer amendment on preſumption of their good effects on a death-bed Abſolution</hi> pronounced in form, as from <hi>the minſters of God,</hi> and a ſuppoſed power <hi>in every prieſt to free every one from all kind of ſin, when danger of death appears,</hi> cannot but be an <hi>encouragement</hi> to defer amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till the laſt hour.</p>

               <p>As I never heard of any body that pretended to teach men that they may be lawfully drunk on any day, I look upon this curſe as a mere fally of zeal: it is enough to remark, that the eating any fleſh is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden <hi>abſolutely</hi> by the church; the drinking wine is not ſo, upon their faſting days. The thing I would recommend to the conſideration of all Papiſts is, their departure from ſcripture. Why do they command abſtinence from <hi>fleſh</hi> on ſo many days in every week? Why abſtain from <hi>meats,</hi> which <hi>God hath ordained to be received by all with thankſgiving?</hi> Why is ſuch a faſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, as may be kept with drinking of <hi>wine,</hi> and other even <hi>ſtronger liquors?</hi> I do not charge them with allowing exceſſes in liquors, but with enjoining to many faſt and meagre days, on a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> not <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal</hi>

               <p>Here again is a ſad inſtance of chicane.

                  <p>But that this is a novel impoſition of that church, will appear from a variety of inſtances of the Popes, and of the fathers, who have aſſerted the right of all Chriſtians to the uſe of the Bible, as Pope Gregory, St. Chryſoſtom, and St. Auſtin

                  <p>If the reader deſires to know when, and upon what occaſion, this liberty was firſt taken from laymen, I will now tell him. The firſt ſynodical prohibition was that of the ſynod of Tholouſe, in the year 1228, in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0010800101:326"/>theſe words: "We forbid that laymen be permitted to have the books of the Old and New Teſtament, unleſs ſome one out of devotion deſire to have the pſalter or breviary for divine offices, and the hours of the Bleſſed Virgin Mary; but even thoſe now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, they may not have tranſlated in the vulgar tongue
<note n="*" place="bottom">D'Acherii, tom. II. p. 624.</note>." The ſpecial occaſion of this decree, was the preaching of the Waldenſes, who taught, that, in articles of faith, the holy ſcriptures were the rule by which men were to judge; that whatſoever was not agreeable to the word of God ought to be rejected; that the reading and knowledge of the ſcriptures was free and neceſſary to all men, both laity and clergy. But when the church of Rome had got a variety of new articles of faith as would not abide the old teſt, it was prudently done to deprive the people of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they might not be able to diſcover the errors into which they led them
<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Stratford's Diſcourſe of the People's Right to read the Scriptures.</note>. And it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the like motive occaſioned this privilege of reading the ſcriptures to be limited to licenſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the 22d ſeſſions of the council of Trident, and have been ſince more ſtrictly confirmed by the authority of other councils, and the decrees of Pope Clement VIII. about the year 1592. This was indeed, ſays another reverend prelate
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Dr. Grove, late Biſhop of Chicheſter's Diſcourſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant and Popiſh way of interpreting Scripture.</note>, a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of caution, but not a jot more than ſhe ſtood in need of; for when ſhe had for a long time perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all her public offices in an unknown tongue, and robbed the laity of half the communion; when ſhe had introduced a ſtrange worſhip of relicks and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and ſet up to herſelf many mediators for interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; when ſhe had maintained, that Chriſt was offered every day in the ſacrifice of the maſs, and taught and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0010800101:327"/>done many things apparently repugnant to the word of God: then, to ſecure herſelf in the poſſeſſion of theſe doctrines and practices, it was but neceſſary ſhe ſhould diveſt the common people of the ſcriptures, and claim to herſelf the ſole right of interpreting. This, and nothing but this, could ſufficiently guard her againſt all contradiction; for whatever expoſition ſhe gives of any controverted place, none muſt dare to call it in queſtion, though ſhe may have frequent occaſion to frame gloſſes directly contrary to the expreſs letter of the text. She is got into that impregnable fortreſs, and will never be forced to yield to the cleareſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that can be brought, while ſhe is able to make good this unlimited power of underſtanding every thing in her own ſenſe. No wonder that the Romaniſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends with ſo much zeal, to bear down all with the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church; and if he can gain this one point, he makes himſelf maſter of all the reſt.

                  <p>But there is another artifice made uſe of, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed for the ſake of evading this charge; which is occaſionally producing verſions of the ſcriptures into the mother tongue, or in the modern tongues; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have contrived, by various falſifications, to make them ſpeak the language of their miſſals and breviaries, in order to ſanctify their novel rites by the authority of the apoſtles, and make the people believe they had been practiſed from the times even of the goſpel. Thus, to countenance the practice of cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing, or beatifying, or making ſaints in the church, they have rendered a paſſage of St. James v. 11. not as it ought to be, Behold how we count them happy or bleſſed, but Behold how we <hi>beatify</hi> thoſe who have ſuffered with conſtancy: and in favour alſo of their proceſſions, where is ſaid, Heb. xi. 30.

                  <head>Of Indulgences.</head>
                  <p>Indulgences are the ſureſt touchſtones which his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs makes uſe of to try the faith of true believers. A vaſt number of devotees imagine that they infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly ſecure the attainment of paradiſe. The origin of theſe means, this ſalutary inſtitution, which has ſince degenerated into an abuſe, ſeems particularly hinted at in a paſſage of St. Cyprian: but be that as it will, the releaſe from torments was not known till a long time after by the name of indulgence. It was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enough indeed in the ſeventh and eighth centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Pope Sergius, in the 884, gave three forty days indulgences at once to ſuch as ſhould viſit the church of St. Martin on the Hills, on the feſtival peculiarly devoted to the ſervice of that ſaint.</p>
                  <p>If the term <hi>Indulgence</hi> be defined, we mean a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from temporal pains, which are due to actual ſins. It will be comprehended with eaſe, that acceſs to heaven is not therefore the freer to ſuch devotees as have obtained it, unleſs by acts of virtue they concur to make it effectual; and yet every one is conſcious of the exceſſive power aſcribed to indulgences, and of the vaſt ſervices they have done to avarice, miſguided zeal, and ambition. No one however ought to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that our intent is to overthrow the real advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of them by this expreſſion; for we are no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the miracles wrought by St. Bernard, who,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0010800101:329"/>whilſt he was preaching up the indulgences of Pope Eugenius III. inflamed the hearts of the believers of his age at once with a ſpirit of war and contrition, and ſhewed the atonement of their crimes, and the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their torments, annexed to thoſe croſſes and ſwords wherewith he perſuaded them to arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the infidels. We are very ſenſible like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that St. Bridget declares, in her revelations, the viſion ſhe had of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who informed her, "That the moſt infallible way to atone for all ſins, was to procure indulgences; that with reſpect to himſelf, whenever he was inclined to treat any ſoul with tenderneſs and affection, he would adviſe it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide conſtantly at Rome, there being no place in the world where ſo many indulgences could be procured." To this we might add, that there is no city more commodious than this for devotees, who would turn their piety towards this object. The Baſilicas have indulgences for every day in the year, and on feſtivals they are redoubled.</p>

                  <p>The Pope claims a right to abſolve men from their oaths, and they have frequently done it. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Conſtance has given us a remarkable inſtance of abſolution from oaths, in the caſe of Frederic Duke of Auſtria; where they ſay, notwithſtanding any oaths
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0010800101:331"/>actually taken to the contrary, from which we abſolve them, that they, and every one of them, ſhall effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obey, &amp;c.

                  <p>This has given occaſion to a late judicious enquiry, how far Papiſts ought to be treated as good ſubjects? Of which I preſume my readers will approve the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing abſtract.</p>
                  <p n="1">I.

                     </gap> I ſay this, I cannot but obſerve, that the Papiſts never have at any time, in any country where they could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, given or profeſſed to give a toleration to ſuch as diſſented from their notions: they never have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any man any where to profeſs opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſentiments which they profeſs.

Now, ſurely the protection of a government is not due to any, but ſuch as are ready to give the ordinary teſts of their allegiance to that government.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. It is well known to all Proteſtants, that Pope Paul V. has abſolutely forbid all Papiſts, or, if the term be more agreeable, all Roman Catholics, to take the oath of allegiance. He inſiſts they cannot take it <hi>ſalva fide Catholica, &amp; ſalute animarum veſtrarum,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Catholic faith, and the ſalvation of their ſouls. Should I add the authority of a cardinal, I mean Bellarmine, to the authority of the Pope, it may be thought I add a notion only of a particular divine. Why now ſhould any one employ his endeavours to have the Roman Catholics enjoy the protection of good ſubjects, when they will not, they <hi>cannot,</hi> they <hi>dare not,</hi> give the ordinary teſt of <hi>allegiance</hi> to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The oath of allegiance is only an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King to be rightful and lawful King of this kingdom, and that the Pope has no power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to depoſe him; and that the perſon who takes ſuch oath will continue to bear faith and true allegiance to him, notwithſtanding any declaration of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication made or granted by the Pope. Now, if the Pope expreſsly forbids all Papiſts to take this oath, and declares his brief to be drawn by his <hi>ſpecial direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

What right then have Roman Catholics to protection under this government
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>See the caſe of Archpreſbyter Blackwell, who was here in England in King James I.'s time, who was committed to priſon, and obtained his liberty by taking the oath of allegiance; and the conſequence was, that he was removed from his office for taking of it, and one Birchett put in his place.</p>

                     </note>?</p>
                  <p>Now the Papiſts have gone on ever ſince in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal to take the oath of allegiance, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ought to be treated as enemies to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Protection and allegiance, in all ſtates, in all governments, are reciprocal. The reaſon of men's entering into ſociety is, by uniting ſtrength, to ſecure themſelves, ſince otherwiſe they might be too weak to reſiſt the attacks of thoſe that might invade them: every particular private man therefore is protected by the ſtrength of the whole, and every one that claims the advantage of this ſecurity, is under obligation to join with the ſociety againſt its enemies. Hence it is, that all governors have a right to demand teſts of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance from the people; and all thoſe who refuſe to give them, when called upon, in effect, declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves enemies of that ſociety. When therefore Papiſts refuſe the teſt of allegiance, they have a right to be refuſed protection. Nor have they any reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of injuſtice, hardſhip, oppreſſion, or by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever name they may call the execution of the laws of this land; ſince an enemy of any ſociety is by the law of ſelf-preſervation to be guarded againſt, and enemies are not to be treated as friends.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Imagine that the legiſlative power in any ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has fixed the perſon who ſhall govern them on the throne; now, if the community conſents to, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of, and readily gives the teſt of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0010800101:337"/>and ſubmiſſion to the perſon fixed by the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and any ſect, or the men of any profeſſion, who refuſe to take the uſual oath for the proof of their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, is it not natural for the government under which they live, to have a jealous eye over them, to guard againſt the increaſe of their ſtrength, to obſerve whether they tamper with the people to corrupt them, to enquire who they are that endeavour to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to ſuch an oppoſition, and to inflict ſome puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on ſuch as miſbehave themſelves in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Now, if any convert to Popery is made an enemy by principle to our government, the government is thereby in proportion ſo much weakened.</p>
                  <p>When therefore our editor tells us, "unanimity can never be expected, unleſs all the <hi>ſubjects</hi> are equally protected,"—he ſhould have ſaid,—"unleſs <hi>friends</hi> and enemies are equally protected,"—and then he had ſpoke what he wanted to be done. But are ſuch as refuſe the common teſts of friendſhip, to be equally protected with thoſe that are friends?—The word <hi>ſubject,</hi> indeed, is a good term, that comprehends all who live under any government, be they what they will, friends or not friends; and if they behave themſelves as good ſubjects, ſhould have a right to protection. But while they acknowledge a ſupremacy in a foreign perſon, and an abſolute ſubmiſſion to him, and own a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance ſo much upon his power, as not to think it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſubmit to our laws, but ſo far only as that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power permits, who, as their governor, pronounce it unlawful to take the oath of allegiance to our King; they cannot juſtly be looked upon as a ſect that ought to be indulged as good friends and good ſubjects; but as profeſſed ſubjects of a foreign power, and an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to that ſtate under which they have long enjoyed peace and quiet

<note n="†" place="bottom">Limborch's Hiſt. of the Inquiſition, p. 318.</note>, glory that the inquiſition is the moſt certain remedy to extirpate hereſies; eſpecially, <hi>Ludovicus à Paramo</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Lib. II. 3.4, 5.</note>, takes a great deal of pains to ſhow that hereſies have, in ſeveral places, been extinguiſhed by the help of the inquiſition, and at laſt concludes in theſe words: "Theſe are ſome of the faireſt fruits, which the moſt fertile field of the holy office hath produced to the church in all kingdoms, where it hath not been obſtructed. But amongſt all provinces and countries, the kingdoms of Spain do every day receive the nobleſt ſruits; for as in theſe countries the holy office of the inquiſition is maintained with greater ſeverity, and is in greater honour and eſteem with the nobles and princes, ſo
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0010800101:347"/>it flouriſhes in greater authority and power, whereby the judges of the earth carry on more diligent inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt hereſies, and more effectually pull them up by the very roots." And becauſe the inquiſition is ſo effectual a method to extirpate hereſies, he gathers from thence, that it was ordained for this purpoſe by the moſt wiſe providence of God. But what is really unjuſt in itſelf, and carried on by unjuſt methods, cannot have God for its author. Nor is ſucceſs any argument that the inquiſition is from God; the firſt inquiry is, whether it be ſuitable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Chriſtian doctrine? If it be not, 'tis then unjuſt and antichriſtian; many things are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſly undertaken by men, and accompliſhed by violence and cruelty, by which innocence is oppreſſed, which although God, in his juſt and wiſe counſel permits, he is far from approving. Even in Japan, a cruel perſecution hath extinguiſhed the Chriſtian religion, as preached by the Roman prieſts, ſo that the Roman Catholic religion is equally extinguiſhed there, by the violence of perſecution, as theſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines are in Spain, which are contrary to the church of Rome, and which they render odious by the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous name of hereſy; and yet they will not allow that any juſt argument can be drawn from hence to prove, that that perſecution was directed by the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as a moſt effectual remedy for the extirpation of their religion. If other parties of Chriſtians would uſe the ſame diligence and cruelty of inquiſition againſt them, I may venture to affirm, that they themſelves could not withſtand it; but that, within a few years, the Popiſh religion would be extinguiſhed in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant countries, and ſcarce a ſingle perſon left who would dare to profeſs it. But God forbid that the Chriſtian religion ſhould ever be propagated this way, which does not conſiſt in a feigned and hypocritical profeſſion, but in a ſincere and undiſſembled faith. And therefore, as no one ought to aſſume to himſelf
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0010800101:348"/>the power of judging concerning it but God, the ſearcher of hearts, to him only let us leave it to paſs the true judgment concerning every man's belief. Let us in the mean while deteſt the tyranny of the Papiſts, and ſtrive to reduce thoſe who in our judgment hold errors in the way of truth, by the good oſſices of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and benevolence, without arrogating to ourſelves a judgment over the conſciences of others. And, out of a ſerious regard to the laſt great day of judgment, let us approve our conſciences to God, and every one of us, expecting from his mercy an equitable and righteous judgment, pray without ceaſing, ARISE, O LORD, AND JUDGE THY CAUSE.</p>

                  <p>This device is ſaid to be firſt hatched by that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious hermit named Peter of Picardy.</p>
                  <p>Pope Urban very opportunely made uſe of for his advantage, and under the pretence of ſympathiſing with the unhappy Chriſtians at Jeruſalem, raiſed an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to favour the purpoſes of dominion and authority, and, in a long harangue in a general council of the weſt, at Cleremont, in the year 1095, he concluded his oration in the following words: "We therefore releaſe all faithful Chriſtians that ſhall bear arms againſt heretics and infidels of great and wonderful penance for their ſins, and receive them under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the church, and the protection of St. Peter and St. Paul.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the particular deſigns of Urban in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, it frequently was made to ſerve other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as their ambition or their reſentment inclined them, as we find they were afterwards againſt the Albigenſes or Waldenſes.</p>
                  <p>Here it may be very proper to ſpeak a little of the perſecutions carried on againſt the Albigenſes or Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes, their principles being the ſame, the former
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0010800101:349"/>name being given them from their inhabiting the town Albigium; the latter as having embraced the principles in general of <hi>Peter Waldo;</hi> and this is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply confirmed by the Popes proceſſes, and ſentence againſt them, it being always in the name of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt perſecution was raiſed againſt them by Pope Innocent III. about the year 1198, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at firſt to reduce them by reaſon and argument, and for that purpoſe ſent two men amongſt them, who found them ſo well eſtabliſhed in their principles, that they offered a free and public diſputation. In the mean time Pope Innocent ſtrengthened himſelf, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to deſtroy or conquer them. Upon this footing the Pope likewiſe ſent out his ſpiritual thunder-bolts, or anathemas, and in the ſame or following year erected the inquiſition; an office peculiarly intended for the finding out and puniſhing ſuch as they pleaſed to call heretics, in which monks were principally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and chiefly they of the order of St. Dominic, inſtituted by the Pope; and by theſe means, together with the invitations and promiſes given by the Popes bulls of full pardon of ſin and paradiſe to all that would come and bear arms againſt them for forty days; ſo that the army increaſed to near 100,000

                  <p>The ſervice conſiſts of prayers and holy leſſons, which the church has appointed to be read every day by the clergy at particular hours. This ſervice is called by the church the canonical hours; becauſe it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the canons of the church, which not only preſcribed the hours in which it is to be ſaid, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the particular circumſtances in which it is to be ſaid. This office is in general called the <hi>breviary,</hi> which has its name from being an abridgment of a longer ſervice, that was formerly uſed, than is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>This office is to be ſaid in a ſtanding poſture, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to the ancient cuſtom of the church, and upon the knees on the days of penance.</p>
                  <p>The office conſiſts of ſeven hours, if mattins and lauds are to be reckoned one, but eight in caſe they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. In the more early ages it was compoſed but of ſix parts, which were <hi>Tierce, Sexte,</hi> and <hi>None,</hi> for the day, and for night, the evening, the midnight, and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayers. At preſent they are divided into ſeven or eight, viz. mattins for night, lauds for the morning, prime, tierce, ſexte, none for the day, veſpers for the evening, and compline for the beginning of the night. The hour of ſaying prime, is directly after ſun-riſing, tierce is fixed to the third hour of the day, ſexte at the ſixth, none at the ninth hour, veſpers towards the evening, and compline after ſun-ſet; and due care is

<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. I. p. 324. &amp; ſeq. See alſo the Explanation of the Maſs.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The prieſt goes to the altar, in alluſion to our Lord's retreat with his Apoſtles to the garden of Olives.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Before he begins maſs, he ſays a preparatory prayer. The prieſt is then to look on himſelf as one abandoned of God, and driven out of paradiſe for the ſin of Adam.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The prieſt makes confeſſion for himſelf, and for the people, in which it is required that he be free from mortal and from venial ſin.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The prieſt kiſſes the altar, as a token of our reconciliation with God, and our Lord's being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by a kiſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The prieſt goes to the epiſtle ſide of the altar, and thurifies or perfumes it. Jeſus Chriſt is now ſuppoſed to be taken and bound.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The <hi>Introite,</hi> ſaid or ſung, <hi>i. e.</hi> a pſalm or hymn, applicable to the circumſtance of our Lord's being carried before Caiaphas the high-prieſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. The prieſt ſays the <hi>Kyrie Eloiſon,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, Lord have mercy upon us, three times, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to Peter's denying our Lord thrice.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. The prieſt turning towards the altar, ſays, <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> i. e. The Lord be with you: the people return this ſalutation, <hi>cum Spiritu tuo,</hi> and with thy Spirit, Jeſus Chriſt looking at Peter.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. The prieſt reads the epiſtle relating to Jeſus being accuſed before Pilate.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. The prieſt bowing before the altar, ſays, <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cor,</hi> i. e. Cleanſe our hearts. The gradual is ſung. This pſalm is varied according as it is the time of Lent or not. The devotion is now directed to our Saviour's being accuſed before Herod, and making no reply.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0010800101:356"/>XI. The prieſt reads the goſpel wherein Jeſus Chriſt is ſent from Herod to Pilate. The goſpel is carried from the right ſide of the altar to the left, to denote the tender of the goſpel to the Gentiles after refuſal by the Jews.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. The prieſt uncovers the chalice, hereby to repreſent our Lord was ſtripped in order to be ſcourged.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. The oblation of the hoſt, the creed is ſung by the congregation. The prieſt then kiſſes the altar, then the prieſt offers up the hoſt, which is to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or import the ſcourging of Jeſus Chriſt, which was introductory to his other ſufferings.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. The prieſt elevates the chalice, then covers it. Here Jeſus's being crowned with thorns is thereby figured to the mind, ſhewing that he was going to be elevated a victim; and it is well known the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims of the Pagans were crowned before they were ſacrificed to their idols.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. The prieſt waſhes his fingers, as Pilate waſhed his hands, declares Jeſus innocent, bleſſes the bread and the wine, bleſſes the frankincenſe, and perfumes the bread and wine, praying that the ſmell of this ſacrifice may be more acceptable to him than the ſmoke of victims.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. The prieſt turning to the people, ſays, <hi>Oratre Fratres,</hi> i. e. let us pray. He then bows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the altar, addreſſes himſelf to the Trinity, and prays in a very low voice. This is one of the ſecretums of the maſs, and the imagination of the devout Chriſtian is to find out the conformity between this and Chriſt being cloathed with a purple robe; but we ſhall be cautious of adding more on this head, that we may not loſe ourſelves in the boundleſs ocean of alluſions.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. The prieſt ſays the preface at the cloſe of the <hi>Secretum.</hi> This part of the maſs is in affinity to Jeſus Chriſt being condemned to be crucified. The prieſt uſes a prayer to God the Father, which is
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0010800101:357"/>followed by the <hi>Sanctus,</hi> holy, holy, holy is the Lord, &amp;c. which the people ſing.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. The prieſt joining his hands, prays for the faithful that are living. This is ſaid to be in alluſion to Jeſus Chriſt bearing the croſs to die upon, that we might live.</p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. The prieſt covers with a cloth the hoſt and chalice, St. Veronica offering her handkerchief to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="20">XX. The prieſt makes the ſign of the croſs upon the hoſt and chalice, to ſignify that Jeſus Chriſt is nailed to the croſs.</p>
                  <p n="21">XXI. The prieſt adores the hoſt before elevated, and then he raiſes it up, in the beſt manner, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our Saviour lifted up upon the croſs. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats the Lord's prayer, with his arms extended, that his body might repreſent the figure of a croſs, which is the enſign of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p n="22">XXII. The prieſt likewiſe conſecrates the chalice, and elevates it, to repreſent the blood of Jeſus Chriſt ſhed upon the croſs.</p>
                  <p n="23">XXIII. The prieſt ſays the <hi>Memento</hi> for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that are in purgatory. This prayer is in alluſion to that which our Lord made for his enemies; but this alluſion would be forced and unnatural, unleſs the devotees looked upon themſelves as his enemies.</p>
                  <p n="24">XXIV. The prieſt then raiſes his voice, ſmiting his breaſt, begs God's bleſſing on himſelf and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, for the ſake of ſuch ſaints as he enumerates, and implores the divine Majeſty for a place in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, to imitate the thief upon the croſs.</p>
                  <p n="25">XXV. The prieſt elevates the hoſt and cup, and ſays the <hi>per omnia.</hi> then the Lord's prayer The ſign of the croſs, which he makes on the hoſt, the chalice, and the altar, is to repreſent to God that bleeding ſacrifice which his ſon offered up to him of himſelf; then the devout Chriſtian becomes the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0010800101:358"/>child of God, and is in alluſion to the virgin Mary's being bid to look on St. John as her ſon.</p>
                  <p n="26">XXVI. After the Lord's prayer, the prieſt ſays a private one to God, to procure his peace by the mediation of the Virgin Mary and the ſaints, then puts the ſacred hoſt upon the paten, and breaks it, to repreſent Jeſus Chriſt giving up the ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="27">XXVII. The prieſt puts a little bit of the hoſt into the chalice. The true Chriſtian is now with an eye of faith to behold Jeſus Chriſt deſcending into <hi>Limbo,</hi> i. e. hell.</p>
                  <p n="28">XXVIII. Then the prieſt ſays, and the people ſing, <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> &amp;c. thrice over, and the prieſt ſmites his breaſt. This action is an alluſion to thoſe who, having ſeen our Lord's ſufferings, returned home ſmiting their breaſts.</p>
                  <p n="29">XXIX. After the <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> is ſung, the prieſt ſays a private prayer for the peace of the church. He then kiſſes the altar, and the inſtrument of peace called the paxis, which being received at his hands by the deacon, it is handed about to the people to be kiſſed, and paſſed from each other with theſe words, <hi>peace be with you;</hi> and whilſt the paxis is kiſſing, the prieſt prepares himſelf for the communion by two other prayers, when he adores the hoſt, and then ſays with a low voice, <hi>I will eat of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. of the 115th pſalm according to the Vulgate. When the prieſt has received the communion, he adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it to the people. The application of theſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies is to the death and burial of Jeſus Chriſt, and his deſcent into hell.</p>
                  <p n="30">XXX. After this the prieſt, putting the wine into the chalice, in order to take what is called the ablu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, repeats a ſhort prayer; then he cauſeth wine and water to be poured out for the ſecond ablu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0010800101:359"/>accompanied with another ſhort prayer, and then ſalutes the congregation. Theſe ablutions alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically repreſent the waſhing and embalming the body of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="31">XXXI. The prieſt ſings the poſt communion, or prayer for a good effect of the ſacrament then received, expreſſed by the glorious reſurrection of the regenerate Chriſtians, and is to be looked upon as the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord's reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="32">XXXII. The prieſt turning to the people, ſays, <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> ſalutes the congregation, as the ambaſſador of Chriſt, with the meſſage of peace.</p>
                  <p n="33">XXXIII. The prieſt reads the beginning of St. John's goſpel, and particularly of Jeſus's appearing to his mother and diſciples, and uſes ſome ſhort prayers.</p>
                  <p n="34">XXXIV. The prieſt diſmiſſes the people with theſe words, <hi>Ite, miſſa eſt,</hi> depart, the maſs is concluded: to which they anſwer, God be thanked. This, they ſay, points to the aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the eternal reward of that ſacrifice, both as prieſt and victim.</p>
                  <p n="35">XXXV. The people receive the benediction of the prieſt or biſhop, if he is preſent, to repreſent the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings promiſed, and poured down upon the apoſtles by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>This benediction muſt be given after kiſſing, with eyes erected to heaven, and their arms ſtretched out, and then gently brought back to the ſtomach, that the hands may join in an affectionate manner for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the faithful. The extenſion of the arms, and joining of the arms, are both myſterious, and ſhew the charity with which the prieſt calls his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual brethren to God. When he pronounces the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, he muſt lean in an engaging poſture towards the altar, as preſcribed by the Italian ſymbolical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, viz. Piſcara, Baudry, and others.

                  <p>The hoſt, or conſecrated wafer, among the Roman Catholics, they worſhip with the profoundeſt reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; of which Dr. Middleton relates as follows. "This celebrated act of Popiſh idolatry, the adoration of the hoſt, I muſt confeſs that I cannot find the leaſt reſemblance of it in any part of the Pagan worſhip; and as oft as I have been ſtanding by at maſs, and ſeen the whole congregation proſtrate on the ground in the humbleſt poſture of adoring at the elevation of this conſecrated piece of bread, I could not help reflecting on that paſſage of Tully, when ſpeaking of the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Heathens in the choice of their Gods. But, ſays he, was any man ever ſo mad as to take that which he feeds upon for a God? This was an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance reſerved for Popery alone, and is now become the principal part of worſhip, and the diſtinguiſhing article of faith in the creed of modern Rome

                  <p>The general diviſion of maſſes is into <hi>high</hi> and <hi>low. High maſs,</hi> called alſo <hi>grand maſs,</hi> is that ſung by the choriſters, and celebrated with the aſſiſtance of a dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con and a ſubdeacon. <hi>Low maſs</hi> is that wherein the prayers are barely rehearſed, without any ſinging, and performed without much ceremony, or the aſſiſtance of a deacon and ſubdeacon. As to ordinary maſſes, there are ſome which are ſaid for the Chriſtian's ſoul, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing it from purgatory, or mitigating its puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there. A ſufficient ſum muſt be left to the prieſt for this purpoſe. The dying man ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathes 20 or 30,000 maſſes to his ſoul, charging the paſtor, on whom he principally relies, toremit this ſtock to him in the other world. There are likewiſe <hi>private maſſes</hi> for the recovery of ſtolen goods, for health, and for travellers, or for returnning God thanks for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mercies; theſe are called <hi>votive maſſes.</hi> The
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0010800101:361"/>maſs uſed at ſea, where the cup is omitted, leſt the wine ſhould be ſpilt by the ſhip's motion, is called the <hi>dry maſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral ſorts of ſolemn maſſes; ſuch are the collegiate, the pontifical, thoſe celebrated before the Pope, cardinals, or biſhops, at Chriſtmas, Paſſion week, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>When HIGH MASS is performed epiſcopally, or by a biſhop, it is attended with more ceremony and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence. As ſoon as the biſhop is obſerved to come in ſight, the bells are rung; on his ſetting his foot within the church-doors, the organs begin to play. The maſter of the ceremonies gives the ſprinkler to the head canon, who preſents it, after he has kiſſed both that and his ſacred hand. His lordſhip ſprinkles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and then the canons, with it, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; and then goes and ſays a prayer before the altar, on which ſtands the holy ſacrament, at a deſk prepared for that particular purpoſe, and does the ſame at the high altar; from whence he withdraws into the veſtry, and there puts on his peculiar ornaments, in the following order.</p>
                  <p>The ſubdeacon goes to a little cloſet contiguous to the altar, and takes from thence the epiſcopal ſandals and ſtockings, which he elevates and preſents to the biſhop. Then the deacon kneels down, and pulls off his lordſhip's ſhoes and ſtockings, who is in the midſt of ſeven or eight acolites, or readers, all upon their knees, as well as the deacon, in their reſpective habits, who ſpreads the prelate's robes. Two acolites, after they have waſhed their hands, take the ſacred habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, holds them up, and gives them to the two dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con aſſiſtants, to put upon the biſhop as ſoon as he has waſhed his hands. The deacon ſalutes the biſhop, takes off his upper garment, and puts on his <hi>amiot,</hi> the croſs whereof he kiſſes; then they give him the albe, the girdle, the croſs for his breaſt, the ſtole, and pluvial. He kiſſes the croſs upon receiving each of them, thereby
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0010800101:362"/>to teſtify his veneration of the croſs; the deacons and aſſiſtants likewiſe kiſs theſe ſacred veſtments. As ſoon as the biſhop is ſeated, they put his mitre on, and a prieſt preſents him with the paſtoral ring. The dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con gives him his right glove, and the ſub-deacon his left, which each of them kiſs, as alſo the hand they have the honour to ſerve in all theſe circumſtances. There are ſome pretry ceremonies to be obſerved, which thoſe who are fond of myſteries may endeavour to account for. It is more material to acquaint our readers, that ejaculatory prayers have been adapted to each individual piece o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then the incenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer with the cenſer, and a prieſt with the navet, out of which the biſhop takes incenſe, puts it into the cenſer, and gives it his benediction. After this he

The incenſe-bearer walks at the head of the proceſſion; two wax-candle bearers, with lighted tapers in their hands, march next on each ſide of him who bears the croſs; all the clergy follow them; the ſubdeacon who is to ſing the epiſtle, carries before his breaſt the New Teſtament ſhut, with the biſhop's maniple in it; a deacon and prieſt march juſt before the biſhop; the biſhop carrying his ſhepherd's crook in his left hand, to diſpenſe his bleſſings to thoſe good Chriſtians he paſſes in the way.

<note n="†" place="bottom">Apion's Account, in his Tableau de la Cour de Rome, and Picart's Cer. vol. I. p. 339.</note>. A pontifical ſolemn maſs prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally differs in two reſpects, always obſerved, when his holineſs himſelf officiates. The firſt is this, the two goſpels are ſung, one in Greek, and the other in Latin; the ſecond, that the communion is different in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal maſs, and performed after the following manner: after the <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> is ſung, his holineſs goes to his throne; the cardinal deacon of the goſpel ſtands in ſuch a manner on the epiſtle ſide, with his hands clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0010800101:364"/>together, that he cannot only ſee the ſacrament on the altar, but the Pope likewiſe going to his throne. When his holineſs is ſeated, the deacon goes and takes the conſecrated hoſt upon the paten, covered with a veil, and, turning to the people, elevates it three times ſucceſſively, that is to ſay, in the middle and at each end of the altar. After that he gives it to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, who carries it to his holineſs; in the mean time, the ſame deacon takes the chalice, in which is the conſecrated wine, and having elevated it three times as he did the water before, carries it to the Pope, who adore Jeſus Chriſt under both kinds, as ſoon as they are brought to him, which he performs with a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately low bow of half his body in a ſtanding poſture; and when the deacon and ſub deacon are come cloſe to him, they place themſelves one on his right hand, and the other on his left hand; his holineſs takes the large hoſt which is upon the paten, and communicates, putting it into his mouth: he then gives two ſmall ones to the deacon and ſubdeacon, who are kneeling, and kiſſes his hand before they receive them. The deacon how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtill holds the chalice, till the aſſiſtant cardinal biſhop, dreſſed in his cope, comes up to the pontifical throne, when the Pope's veſtry-keeper preſents him with a ſmall gold Pope, one end whereof he dips into the chalice, and his holineſs at the ſame time takes hold of the other, and inclining his head a little, ſucks up a part of the conſecrated wine, leaving the reſt to the deacon, who carries the chalice to the altar, and there ſucks up a part of it, and leaves a little for the ſubdeacon, who drinks it without the Pipe, as alſo that which is poured out for the ablution of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, which he wipes with the purificatory, or white linen cloth: in the mean time his holineſs gives the kiſs of peace only to the deacon, and the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion only under one kind to the other cardinals, ambaſſadors, princes, prelates, and ſometimes to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, who have deſired to receive that mark

                  <p>We might here relate the peculiar ceremonies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending high maſs at Chriſtmas, when his holineſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiates, who, being dreſſed in all his pontifical orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (the moſt remarkable whereof on this occaſion are the white pluvial and precious mitre) by the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal deacons already in their robes, bleſſes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe preſented to the thurifier; after that the pontiff is preceded by the Roman and other prelates, who all wear white mitres.</p>
                  <p>The incenſe-bearer, and ſeven acolites, each with a wax-taper in his hands, walk before the croſs-bearer, and a clerk of the chamber before the incenſe-bearer, who holds a ſword lifted up, with a cap upon it, which is a repreſentation perhaps of the irreſiſtible power and efficacy of the pontifical ſword, which Chriſt's vicar has inherited from St. Paul, with that of freeing Chriſtians from the bondage of the devil, by a right acquired by the ſon of God, whoſe nativity is then ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated. It is conſidered likewiſe as an emblem of the church's dignity and freedom under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Pope. Many of the ſuperior clergy make up this holy proceſſion; and ſhould the Emperor, or any other ſovereign prince, happen to be at Rome at that time, he muſt carry the train of the Pope's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; two cardinals likewiſe hold up the two ends of it. His holineſs walks in a very ſtately and majeſtic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, under a canopy ſupported by eight gentlemen of the firſt rank.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Pope is got into the church, he paſſes on to a chapel, and then ſits down. The cardinals come and bow to him, and kiſs the hem of the holy father's pluvial on the right ſide; then comes the other prelates in order, and kiſs his right knee. The Latin and Greek deacons, who aſſiſt his holineſs, ſtand
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0010800101:366"/>in readineſs at the altar. After ſome anthems are ſung, a veſtry-keeper puts on the arms of a Latin ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, a ſmall napkin, whereon are laid his holineſs's ſandals and ſtockings. The ſubdeacon carries alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the Pope, with his hands held up to his eyes. The acolites follow him, and whilſt the fub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon and a gentleman of the privy chamber get un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the holy father's pluvial, to put on his ſtockings and his ſandals, the acolites take care to ſpread the borders of the pluvial whilſt the ſubdeacon is putting them on. The aſſiſtant biſhops who are preſent at this religious ceremony hold before his holineſs a book and a wax-taper, who, with his aſſiſtant deacons, ſings an anthem and a pſalm. The choir ſing tierce, during which the Pope riſes, and an aſſiſtant biſhop goes up to him with the pontifical; two taper-bearers attend with lights in their hands. The pontiff takes off his mitre, which is done frequently in this ceremony, and puts it on again. Then an aſſiſtant biſhop lays the pontifical on his own head, that his holineſs may read the office of the day, and another aſſiſtant ſupports the book in one hand, and holds a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His holineſs having waſhed, the goſpel deacon, aſſiſted with two others, takes off his mitre, pluvial, and ſtole, in order to put on ſeveral other robes, which the acolites bring him from the altar, viz. the girdle, the breaſt-croſs, the dalmatica, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0010800101:367"/>then the ceremony of the ſervice begins; during which there is the ceremony of delivering to the Pope a purſe with twenty-five julio's in it of antique money; and the ſubdeacons and the maſter of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies kiſs the Pope's feet, with ſome other inſignificant ceremonies.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe the beads being a devotion particularly inſtituted to commemorate the incarnation of Chriſt, and to honour him in his bleſſed mother, it was thought proper to repeat ſo much the oftener that prayer, which is particularly adapted to theſe ends. In the mean time, it may be proper ſo take notice, 1. That if in the beads there be ten <hi>hail Maries</hi> ſaid for one <hi>our father,</hi> in the maſs and office of the church, almoſt all the prayers are directed to God alone. 2. That every <hi>hail Mary,</hi> both by the nature of the prayer, and the intention of the church, is directed more to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the ſon than of the mother, as well becauſe the church, in honouring the mother, has principally in view the honour of the ſon, as alſo becauſe this prayer particularly relates to the incarnation of Chriſt; and if withal it begs her prayers, then ſhe is only deſired to pray for us.</p>
                  <p>To which if we add, that her prayers are ten times better and more acceptable to God than ours, it will appear no ways abſurd that we ſhould ſo frequently deſire her prayers; for as to the repetition of the ſame prayer, it is what is recommended to us by the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0010800101:371"/>example of our Lord, St. Matt. xxvii. 42, 44, &amp;c. and has nothing of abſurdity in it.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>On all common, but public occaſions, the croſs is carried before the ſovereign Pontiff. At the end of a pike about ten palms or ſpans long, the image of our Saviour is turned towards the Pope; and the chaplain, who carries it, walks bareheaded, when his holineſs goes in public, or is carried on mens ſhoulders; but when he goes in a coach or chair the chairman carries the crucifix on horſeback bareheaded. But on all ſolemn and religious occaſions where the Pope attends in his ſacred robes, an auditor of the rota carries the crucifix at the ſolemn proceſſion, on horſeback, dreſſed in a rocket and capuche, or ſort of cope, purple-coloured; but there are three days in Paſſion week on which he and the ſacred college go to the chapel in mourning, without the croſs being borne before him.</p>

                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0010800101:376"/>We find likewiſe even as early as the ſourth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, the croſs was in great veneration among Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; to countenance which the Papiſts have formed many ſabulous ſtories and pretended miracles. It has however been an increaſing ſuperſtition ever ſince, ſo that feſtivals have been invented in honour of the croſs. The invention of the croſs is celebrated on the third day of May; the exaltation of it on the fourteenth day of September; and one of the principal relicks is the pretended parts of the croſs on which Chriſt was crucified. The rituals preſcribe the proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>form</hi> and manner in which they ſhould be made, and in which at our devotion it ſhould be figured on the breaſt.

The Litany follow it, and then an anthem; he then ſprinkles the croſs with holy water, and afterwards perfumes it with frankincenſe; then the candles are placed on the arms of the croſs, to which, if high, he aſcends by a ladder, and concludes with muſic, ſinging of pſalms and prayer

                  <p>St. Chryſoſtom, towards the cloſe of the fourth century, diſplays alſo the miraculous cures wrought by the uſe of conſecrated oil, and by the ſign of the croſs; which laſt he calls a defence againſt all evil, and a medicine againſt all ſickneſs, and affirms it to have been miraculouſly impreſſed in his own time in peoples garments

                  <p>Bellarmine, to juſtify this device of the ſign of the croſs, or of croſſing themſelves, and the wonderful virtue and benefits thence ariſing, urges the ſprinkling of the blood of the paſchal lamb on the poſts of their doors, Exod. xii. 7. God's commanding in a viſion to the prophet a mark to be ſet on ſuch of the inhabitants of Jeruſalem as had not wallowed in the ſame tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion with the reſt, but wept for all the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that had been done in the midſt thereof, Ezek. ix. 4. What is this to the Papiſt's croſſing himſelf,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0010800101:379"/>to keep the devil from him, to make him lucky in his buſineſs, to preſerve him from ſin, to guard him from danger, &amp;c.?</p>
                  <p>This ſuggeſts the following reflections, 1. That the ſigning one's ſelf with the croſs hath neither command nor example in ſcripture, nor any promiſe of any ſpecial grace or benefit to be thereupon conferred; therefore there is no reaſon to expect any ſuch extraordinary virtues or aſſiſtance from uſing the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the ſign of the croſs was firſt inſtituted by men only to be an external mark of Chriſtians from others, then it is no ſuch ſacred and venerable ſign as to be able to convey to or operate in us ſuch bleſſings; but the firſt is plain, as well from the ſilence of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as from the voice of hiſtory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If therefore external ſigns, inſtituted by God himſelf, when they become the inſtruments or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuperſtition or idolatry, are to be taken away, then much more ſigns of human inſtitution, as this of the croſs is.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, ſince Papiſts have ſo horribly abuſed this ſign, every Proteſtant juſtly diſowns and proteſts againſt the ſuperſtitious and idolatrous conceits which they have introduced relating thereunto; amongſt whom the ſign of the croſs makes void the croſs of Chriſt, they attributing to the croſs that which ſolely and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly belongs to Chriſt, and is the effect of his death through faith in him, but not effected by the ſign of the croſs

                  <p>This cuſtom appears to have had its riſe about the ſeventh century. The church of Rome probably borrowed is from the Pagans or Mahomedans; the former indeed not only bowed their body, but fell down poſtrate, or upon their knees, before their idols.

Juſtin Martyr ſays, it was invented by daemons. However, the Roman Catholic church adopt the uſe of holy water, on pretence of ſecuring mankind againſt the deluſions of the devil, and many of their learned writers reckon up ſeveral virtues and benefits derived from the uſe of it, both to the ſoul and the body, and to aſſert the atteſtation of the ſame by miracles.

                  <p>It was a remarkable part of the Heathen ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, on ſome particular days, they had proceſſions in honour of the God whoſe feſtival they were celebrating, wherein they were attended by prieſts in ſurplices, with wax-candles in their hands, carrying upon a pageant the images of their Gods; according to the account of <hi>Apuleius</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>Tournefort,</hi> in his travels through Greece, reflects upon the Greek church for having retained in their worſhip many of the rites of heatheniſm: But the reflection was full as applicable to his own as to the Greek church, in the very inſtance of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the pictures of their ſaints, as the Pagans did thoſe of their Gods.</p>
                  <p>Thus, ſays our author Dr. Middleton, in one of thoſe proceſſions lately made to St. Peter's in the time of Lent, I ſaw that ridiculous penance of the flagellantes, or ſelf-whippers, who march with whips in their hands, and laſh themſelves on the bare back till they bled, in the ſame manner as the fanatical prieſts of Bellona uſed to cut and flaſh themſelves of old, in order to pleaſe that Goddeſs.</p>
                  <p>And in the Romiſh church they have another exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the ſame kind, and in the ſeaſon of Lent; for, on a certain day appointed annually for this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,

                  <p>THE Greek church may (at leaſt) for ſeveral centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be conſidered as a part of the Roman church, having the ſame apoſtolical foundation (nay, the church of Jeruſalem was eſtabliſhed by the apoſtles much

They likewiſe adhered pretty much to the doctrine of <hi>Arius,</hi> acknowledged the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of the Father to the Son; and as it was the cuſtom of many of the biſhops to draw up a creed for his own church, moſt of their articles were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the canons and creed called the apoſtles, which in ſubſtance is of the greateſt antiquity; and did alſo admit of the Nicene creed, drawn up A. D. 318: but in proceſs of time the Nicene creed was new-modelled by the general council of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, A. D. 381, when that part of it relating to the conſubſtantiality of the Son with the Father was reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, and from this time we find ſome unchriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian animoſity ſubſiſted between the eaſtern and weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern churches, each cenſuring and anathematizing each other. Many points merely ſpeculative diſtracted and divided the churches, pelagianiſm, and the authority of particular counc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ls, &amp;c. and theſe not only conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, but increaſed to the ſixth century; councils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in the eaſt, in oppoſition to thoſe in the weſt; the remarkable diſputes (before mentioned) called the three chapters, and about the corruptibility or uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, and whether we may or ought to ſay that one of the <hi>Trinity</hi> ſuffered, upon which many of the eaſtern churches ſeparated in their communion from the church of Rome; and it is certain the Greek church made ſome good regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>In the ſeventh century they convened a council, which fixed the diſcipline of the Greek church, made 102 canons, or eccleſiaſtical laws, although they were
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0010800101:394"/>never received in the weſt, approving the canonical letters of St. Baſil, appointed the myſteries of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be received raſting; they gave the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in both kinds; mixed water with wine; forbad the eating cheeſe or eggs in Lent, that there ſhould be no faſting on Saturdays, and prohibited the eating of blood.</p>
                  <p>Other matters of diſpute contributed to widen their difference; and in the ninth century there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between the Pope of Rome, and the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, about Bulgaria. The P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pe's legates affirmed it belonged to the Pope, and that the Bulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians ought to ſubmit themſelves to the church of Rome. The eaſtern patriarchs aſſerted, that Bulgaria having been taken from the Greeks, and formerly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Greek biſhops, ought to be ſubject to the patriarch of Conſtantinople: the Emperor likewiſe favoured the patriarch's party, and a diviſion conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently enſued, A. D. 878. The Greeks ſoon after preferred ten articles of accuſation againſt the Latins; the firſt was againſt the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt; the Greeks denying that the Holy Ghoſt proceeded from the Father and the Son, and aſſerted his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Father only. They found fault with the Latins for not having eight weeks in their Lent, with the Latin prieſts ſhaving their beards, with their being obliged to celibacy, with their forbidding to anoint with the holy chriſm the foreheads of thoſe they baptiſed. They charged them with making biſhops of deacons, without firſt conferring on them the order of prieſt; they oppoſed the primacy of Rome, and would have preferred the Patriarchs of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, or at leaſt made them equal; they likewiſe charged the Latins with making the holy chriſm with river water, and with offering a lamb at Eaſter, together with the body and blood of Chriſt, after the manner of the Jews.</p>

                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0010800101:395"/>From this time we may with ſome propriety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>Greek church</hi> as diſtinct from the church of Rome, notwithſtanding ſo great an agreement as there ſubſiſts between the eaſtern and weſtern churches, both in their principles and practices, eſpecially as the conſtitution of the Greek church differs from that of Rome.</p>
                  <p>The Greek church, according to their original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, is governed by four patriarchs, viz. thoſe of Alexandria, of Jeruſalem, of Antioch, and of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople; the latter of which aſſumes to himſelf the title of <hi>Univerſal,</hi> or <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Patriarch, on account of his reſiding in the imperial city, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a larger juriſdiction than the reſt. This title was confirmed by a council convened in that capital in the year 518. This Patriarch likewiſe aſſumes the title of holineſs, in the abſtract; and Cyril Lucar, at the beginning of one of his letters, aſſumes the title of oecumenical judge of the Chriſtian churches dependant on the imperial throne of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople

                  <p>The Emperor of the Turks may indeed with truth be ſtiled the ſupreme head of the Greek church, as the Patriarch himſelf, the biſhops, &amp;c. are obliged to procure his letters-patent before they can act in their reſpective functions.</p>

                     <hi>The following is a</hi> SUMMARY <hi>of the</hi> BELIEF <hi>and</hi> PRAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICE <hi>of the</hi> GREEK CHURCH.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. They believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things, viſible and inviſible.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In one lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the only begotten ſon of God, begotten of his Father before all worlds, God of Gods, light of lights; very God of very God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, not made, being one ſubſtance with the Father,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0010800101:396"/>by whom all things were made: who for us men, and for our ſalvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and was made man, and was crucified for us; alſo under Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate; he ſuffered and was buried, (or deſcended into the grave) and the third day he roſe again accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſcriptures, and aſcended into heaven, and fitteth at the right-hand of the Father; and he ſhall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead, of whoſe kingdom there ſhall be no end.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That the Holy Ghoſt proceeds only from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not from the ſon; yet they believe him to be God.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. They do not acknowledge the Pope's ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, nor infallibility, nor conſequently that the church of Rome is the true mother-church; they even prefer their own to that of Rome, as the moſt apoſtolical; and on Holy Thurſday excommunicate the Pope, and all the Latin prelates, as heretics and ſchiſmatics.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. They believe no other ſacraments than baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper. Baptiſm they perform, by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the perſon three times under water diſtinctly, at the name of the FATHER, the SON, and of the HOLY GHOST. They uſe a kind of anointing, croſſing, &amp;c. in baptiſm. They baptiſe infants, and have one god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father or godmother, according to the ſex of the child. But baptiſm is often deferred by them, till their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are five, ten, or fifteen years of age, or longer, and they rebaptiſe all the Latins who are admitted to their communion.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. That the Lord's ſupper ought to be adminſtered in both kinds, even to infants, before they can be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſtinguiſhing the ſpiritual food from any other. The laity are indiſpenſibly obliged to receive the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in both kinds. They ſeal the bread in the euchariſt with the form of a croſs. Their bread is lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened. They receive both the bread and wine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a ſpoon, from the hands of a prieſt, and always faſting. Whether they acknowledge tranſubſtantiation or not, which is diſputed, they pay a ſuperſtitious
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0010800101:397"/>veneration to their conſecrated bread. They do not indeed carry it in proceſſion, but after the prieſt has conſecrated it, he elevates it, and ſays, <hi>Thou art my God; thou art my King, I adore thee; Lord have mercy upon me, miſerable ſinner,</hi> and in the whole of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice are extremely ſuperſtitious.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. They exclude confeſſion, confirmation, extreme unction, and matrimony, from being ſacraments. Though they recommend a confeſſion four times a year; yet they deny that auricular confeſſion is a divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and at beſt regard it only as an injunction of the church, and inſiſt that it ought always to be free and voluntary; but is in no wiſe neceſſary to make a full diſcovery of all their ſins, or of all the circumſtances attending them.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Confirmation is adminiſtered immediately after baptiſm. This has always been eſteemed by them a part of the prieſt's office, and is not deferred to be performed by a biſhop, in any of the Greek churches.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Extreme unction, as uſed by the Papiſts, is practiſed in ſome degree; but they diſclaim that name, or calling it a ſacrament: the Greeks adminiſter it to all ſick perſons, and as often as a perſon in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances might deſire it, without waiting till the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is at the point of death.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. They maintain likewiſe, that matrimony is no ſacrament; but, on the contrary, an union that may be diſſolved, and that, in the caſe of adultery, or other provocations, it may be lawful to ſeparate. Their prieſts are equally approved, if married before the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy orders; but they don't indulge them in that reſpect afterwards. They think marriage a fourth time unlawful. They deny that fornication is a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Though they diſbelieve the notion of purgatory, they offer up prayers for the dead. The words of their office, cranſlated, run thus, "Grant, O Lord, that his ſoul may be at reſt, in thoſe manſions of light, conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0010800101:398"/>and repoſe, from whence all grief and ſorrow are for ever excluded."</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. They are divided as to their ſentiments of hell, as of a different nature and duration. They, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, favour the notion, that the torments of hell will not be eternal.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. The Greeks, and all the eaſtern nations in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, are of opinion, that departed ſouls will not be immediately and perfectly happy; that the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe will be a ſtate of repoſe, and the next of eternal felicity.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. They enjoin the obſervation of diverſe faſts and feſtivals: they have four lents; the firſt begins on the fourteenth of November; the ſecond, the great lent before Eaſter; the third, the week after Pentecoſt; and the fourth, on the firſt of Auguſt. At theſe times they eat nothing that has blood, or oil, nor milk-meats, but herbs, and ſhell-fiſh, and are ſo extremely ſuperſtitious, that they ſcarce allow an egg or fleſh-broth to a ſick perſon. Yet they diſdain the Latins for their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the vigils before the nativity of Chriſt, and the feſtivals of the Virgin Mary and the apoſtles, as well as for their faſting in Ember-Week; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit all faſting on Saturdays, except on the Saturday preceding Eaſter.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. They ſtrictly abſtain from eating ſuch things as have been ſtrangled, and ſuch other meats as are prohibited in the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. They reject the religious uſe of graven images, and ſtatues, although they admit of pictures in their churches, and have a great veneration for them.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. They worſhip angels, and pray to the Virgin Mary, pray and ſing hymns to the ſaints, and are very ſuperſtitious in the hiſtories of them.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. They attend prayers, morning and evening, and enjoin prayers for Kings, and all civil and eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical magiſtrates, and for the converſion of ſchiſmatics and heretics.</p>
                  <p n="19">
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0010800101:399"/>XIX. They enjoin obedience and honour to the prieſt,</p>
                  <p n="20">XX. They forbid the laity to invade the rights and benefits of the clergy, and all kinds of ſacrilegious acts.</p>
                  <p n="21">XXI. They forbid marrying in Lent, or on other faſts.</p>
                  <p n="22">XXII. They prohibit the frequenting theatres, and other Gentile cuſtoms.</p>
                  <p n="23">XXIII. They forbid the laity to read the books of heretics.</p>
                  <p n="24">XXIV. Though they reject the Apocrypha, as being uncanonical; yet they hold ſome traditions of equal authority with the ſcripture; and greatly venerate the writings of Baſil, Chryſoſtom, Damaſcene, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="25">XXV. Of all the general councils that have been held in the Catholic church by the Popes at different times, they pay no regard to any after the ſixth; and reject the ſeventh, which was the ſecond held at Nice.</p>
                  <p n="26">XXVI. Their excommunications are often made on very frivolous occaſions.</p>
                  <p n="27">XXVII. They hold juſtification by faith and works conjointly.</p>
                  <p n="28">XXVIII. They deny that the office of ſubdeacon is at preſent an holy order.</p>
                  <p n="29">XXIX. They have a great number of monks, all of St. Baſil's order; theſe have their abbots. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, Metropolian, and biſhops, are of this order.</p>
                  <p n="30">XXX. They have ſour liturgies or maſſes; St. James's, St. Chryſoſtom, St. Baſil's, (which they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally eſteem) and Gregory the Great, which laſt is uſed by the Latins, and they celebrate the maſs in the old Greek tongue
<note n="*" place="bottom">Notwithſtanding from the preceeding articles it appears, that the conſtitution and doctrine of the Greek church is in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects modelled more agreeable to ſcripture than the church of Rome; yet their extreme ſuperſtition in the obſervation of their I eats, in the performance of the ſacraments, their conſecrated places, veſtments, utenſils, and even the hollowed ground, ſhew they come very little behind the church of Rome in ſuperſtitious ceremonies.</note>.</p>

                  <p>The French church, by acknowledging the Pope's ſupremacy, and by perſevering inflexibly in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and (with very little exception) to the numerous train of ſuperſtitious ceremonies of that holy mother church, may be conſidered as one of her perfectly obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſons. It is true, the French nation ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the Pope's claim was unlimited, and would affect not only the royal prerogative, but the liberty and property of his ſubjects; and therefore, in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth century, the French King not only objected to, but refuſed compliance with ſome claims of the Pope relating to the right of conferring benefices. And though this diſpute, in the cloſe of the twelfth century, between Boniface VIII. and Philip I. King of France, produced ſome dreadful effects, the French never loſt ſight of their point, but aſſerted the King's preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to what what was called the regale; and in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century, when the council of Trent had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the authority of the Pope, in oppoſition to the prerogative of the King of France, he ordered his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to proteſt againſt it; and in the year 1680, when Pope Innocent XI. ſeemed determined to oppoſe his right, there was held a national council of the clergy to regulate this diſpute, who confirmed his right of the regale over all the churches of the kingdom. Yet ſoon after Lewis XIV. to diſcover his ſuperſtitious venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope, and his bigotted attachment to the perſecuting ſpirit of popery, or in complaiſance to the Pope, repealed the edict of Nantz, and baniſhed his Proteſtant ſubjects, or treated them with cruel ſeverities.</p>

                  <p>The following articles point out wherein they conſiſt.</p>

                  <p n="5">V. The Pope has no authority to levy any tax or impoſition upon the eccleſiaſtical preferments, upon any pretence either of loan, vacancy, annates, tythes, procurations, or otherwiſe, without the King's order, and the conſent of the clergy.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The Pope has no authority to depoſe the King, or grant away his dominions to any perſon whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. His holineſs can neither excommunicate the King, nor abſolve any of his ſubjects from their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.</p>

               <p>WE ſhall now take a retroſpective view of thoſe dark and babarous ages of the world, when paganiſm and the groſſeſt idolatry had overſpread theſe iſles, and ſuccinctly point out ſome remarkable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and circumſtances that intervened, and at length made way for the introduction and prevalence of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, though for a long time after incumbered with a variety of Romiſh ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>The antient inhabitants of Britain, not only at firſt ſettling here, but for a conſiderable time, were in a ſtate of ignorance and barbarity; nor indeed could it from the nature of things be otherwiſe, unleſs countries ſhould happen to be peopled by large colonies from ſocieties that have already arrived to a conſiderable proficiency of knowledge and government, which could not poſſibly be the caſe in early periods. The perſons who originally ſettled in theſe remote parts of Europe, being rude and unpoliſhed themſelves, were able to carry nothing along with them but their own ſavage manners, and their own groſs conceptions.</p>
               <p>The firſt inhabitants of an uncultivated region generally apply themſelves to ſuch employments and exerciſes as the want of proviſion may urge them to; probably to hunting as the moſt ſpeedy means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; the next ſtage is paſturage, and a third agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture; the laſt ſtep is regulated governments: all theſe
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0010800101:405"/>muſt, as it were, make way for the introduction of knowledge, the trueſt ſource of religion.</p>
               <p>Though England might be peopled ſeveral centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries before the firſt accounts we have of it, yet the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous condition in which we perceive it to have been, is no more than might reaſonably be expected. At the time when Caeſar invaded the iſland, even huſbandry itſelf does not ſeem to have been univerſally followed: our anceſtors however do not appear to have been without ſome ſkill in war; for tho' in this reſpect they were greatly inferior to the Romans, yet they conducted their oppoſition to Caeſar in a manner that redounds highly to their credit, conſidering the amazing abilities of that general, and the excellent diſcipline of his army. Ambition and reſentment ſeemed at this time to have gained the aſcendancy of their reaſon and humanity; that they had brought the wretched arts of mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction much ſooner to perfection than thoſe which refine the ſoul, and are cultivated to adorn, improve, and bleſs ſociety. To rectify this great diſorder and unhappineſs, ſome perſons were pretty early diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, by a ſuperior penetration into the difference of principles and actions, whoſe diſpoſitions likewiſe led them to compaſſionate the unhappy ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind at that time, ſo far ſunk in ignorance and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm. Some of the firſt thus diſtinguiſhed and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, famous in hiſtory, were the <hi>Druids</hi>

               <p>The DRUIDS,
<note>Hiſtory of the Druids.</note> according to the general hiſtory of them, we are apt to look upon as perſons of very extraordinary accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments. This deception has been aſſiſted by our poets, who have ſpread a glory round them, and have painted them in a manner that diſpoſes us to regard them as almoſt divine. No one has more charmingly contributed to carry on the deluſion than the ingenious and elegant Maſon, in his Caractacus. But if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0010800101:406"/>our ideas to the teſt of ſober reaſon, we ſhall not find much in the Druids that was particularly excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and valuable. They were the prieſts of the time, and, like other prieſts, had addreſs and ſubtility enough to acquire a vaſt authority, and to keep the people in abſolute ſubjection. They were likewiſe magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates as well as prieſts, and had the determination of civil cauſes; a circumſtance which was the natural effect, both of their ſuperior quality, and ſuperior knowledge; for what knowledge then prevailed, was principally confined to them. However, the remains we have of the Druids do not give us a very high opinion of the progreſs they had made, though undoubtedly they went far beyond the reſt of their countrymen, and it is probable that individuals among them might be men of great wiſdom.</p>
               <p>They entertained the notion of tranſmigration; a notion which has ſpread from the fartheſt eaſt to the remoteſt weſt, and which has been ſo widely embraced, that a philoſophical perſon cannot help looking on this fact as a ſingular phaenomenon in the hiſtory of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and imagine that either there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it very natural to the unenlightened mind of man, or that it proceeded from an antient and general tradition. The beſt principles advanced by the Druids were, that the Deity is one, and infinite, and that his worſhip ought not to be confined within walls; that all things derive their origin from heaven; that the ſoul is immortal; and that children ſhould be educated with the utmoſt care. But their prodigious veneration for the miſletoe, and the great effects they attributed to it, their opinion that the moon is a ſovereign remedy for diſeaſes, with others of their ſentiments and cuſtoms, ſhewed a ſtrong ſuperſtition; as their prohibiting an intercourſe with ſtrangers, if not merely a political law, teſtified a ſavageneſs of manners; and their allowance, nay, command, of human ſacrifices carries in it the evidence of the moſt
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0010800101:407"/>ſhocking cruelty. In truth, they were little more than the barbarous prieſts of a barbarous and unle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered people. Their knowledge is ſaid to have reached to phyſics, to the mathematics, to aſtronomy, and to medicine; but as it was never committed to writing, it could not be very extenſive: indeed it chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of the arcana of their doctrines and worſhip, and had a ſpecial relation to magic. Whatever their wiſdom was, if we may give credit to the teſtimony of Caeſar, it was found here in greater perfection than in Gaul; from whence children were ſent into Britain, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the diſcipline of the Druids. The ſame author informs us, that it had its original in this country; but that is a circumſtance much diſputed.</p>
               <p>There were likewiſe prieſts of an inferior order, called Bards, whoſe principal buſineſs was to celebrate the praiſes of the gods and departed heroes, in odes and verſes, and to ſing them to their harps, at their religious aſſemblies, public feſtivals, and private en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments. Theſe men were, in fact, the heralds, the chronologers, and the hiſtorians, as well as the poets of the land, for they kept up the memory of illuſtrious tranſactions; and by their compoſitions, which tradition handed down to poſterity, they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from age to age the names and characters of patriots and warriors

               <p>The divine <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf can be conſidered as no other than one of them, whoſe conſummate excellency, and a number of circumſtances, contributed to preſerve his works from oblivion, and to raiſe him to the higheſt ſeat in the temple of Fame. Bards have been found in many countries, and continued in Scotland and Ireland nearly to our own time. As to the antient Britiſh ones, we have few remains of their productions; but we may venture to aſſert that many of them were truly valuable.</p>

But all this time, wherever they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, they were for poliſhing and reforming the manners of the inhabitants, and diffuſing the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of arts and ſciences; though it muſt be owned, that, during the warm conteſts which ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Romans and the Britons, when the latter ſo gloriouſly, ſo bravely, though ſo unſucceſſively, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled to maintain their independence, little progreſs could be made in literature: but when the country was peaceably ſettled into provinces, then civility began to ſpread itſelf, and knowledge more generally diffuſed, inſomuch that many of the Britiſh nobles ſtudied the Roman learning, and valued themſelves on their magnificence and politeneſs, becoming pleaſed with what was in fact the badges of their ſlavery.</p>
               <p>During this time there were, no doubt, ſchools of philoſophy, and ſeveral eminent men; but who were moſt celebrated, or what ſciences were moſt cultivated, we are not able to ſay, no traces of them being now
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0010800101:409"/>to be found. The confuſion that ſucceeded deſtroyed all the remains of learning, and left a blank in this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod which cannot be filled up.</p>
               <p>But there is one event belonging to this aera,
<note>A. D. 314.</note> which, beſides its own immenſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in other views, comes more immediately under my notice, viz. the propagation of chriſtianity in theſe iſles. It is not neceſſary to inquire who was the perſon by whom the religion of Jeſus was firſt preached, or the exact time when it was introduced: ſuppoſing we reject all conjectures of its being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged by the apoſtles, or their immediate diſciples, it is probable that it was very ſoon communicated to the Britons. It might be gaining ground, and ſpread greatly, before it received a civil eſtabliſhment, as we are informed of many martyrs who witneſſed to the truth, under the perſecution raiſed by the Emperor Diocleſian, of whom St. Albian is reckoned the proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martyr of North Britain; and from the days of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine the goſpel would no doubt be much diffuſed, and generally embraced: accordingly we are aſſured, that three Britiſh biſhops aſſiſted at the council of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, A. D. 314. and ſubſcribed the acts of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.

               <p>Now, ſo illuſtrious an event as the propagation of chriſtianity in this country, could not take place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bringing along with it a mighty change in the ſtate of knowledge; all thoſe who embraced our holy religion were turned from groſs idolatry and abſurd ſuperſtition, to the belief and worſhip of one God. The reception of it was a vaſt acquiſition of wiſdom, as it contributed in many reſpects to expand the mind, and ſoften the manners of our anceſtors; it would not in thoſe ſimple times, when human reaſon was more imperfect than it now is, produce ſuch noble and extended views of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0010800101:410"/>things as we can at preſent attain, eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ſoon errors and ſuperſtitions began to be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the goſpel; nevertheleſs it had not then been corrupted ſo much as it hereafter was, and during the purer ages it might greatly promote juſt and rational ſentiments in general
<note n="*" place="bottom">Abſtract from the Library, p. 76.</note>.</p>
               <p>What the particular ſtate of religion was, it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to aſcertain; but we find doctrinal diſputes agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated men in thoſe days, as well as in ſucceeding pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods. The notions of Arius are ſaid to have been embraced in this country, and it is an undoubted fact, that Pelagianiſm was very prevalent. It was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent as to occaſion ſharp controverſies, and ſome biſhops were ſent over from Gaul to recover the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons to the oppoſite opinions, though without any laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>From about this time,

<note>445</note> He was originally chieftain of the Silures, ſettled in Radnorſhire, and had acquired ſome reputation by his warlike atchievements againſt the enemies of his country; tho' his martial genius by no means appeared at this juncture, when, inſtead of exerting the natural ſtrength of the kingdom, which, if properly applied, would have been ſufficient to ſecure it from the deſigns of the enemy, he placed his dependance upon foreign auxiliaries. By his weakneſs or knavery he betrayed his country into the hands of the Saxons, who had for a century and a half infeſted the coaſt of Britain to ſuch a degree, that the Roman Emperors, from the reign of Diocleſian, maintained a conſiderable military force under the count of the Saxon ſhore, on purpoſe to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

               <p>Vortigern,
<note>447</note> not a little agitated by his fears, which were the more predominant from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiouſneſs of his demerit, employed his emiſſaries to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm the nobility with the exaggerated accounts of the ſtrength, deſtination, and malevolence of their old enemies the Scots and Picts. Having thus artfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared their minds for the propoſal, he ſummoned them to a general council, on pretence of deliberating on the neceſſity of the ſtate, and there managed their paſſions with ſuch dexterity, that they inveſted him with full power to invite the Saxons into England, and aſſign to them the iſle of Thanet for their habitation.</p>
               <p>The Saxons did not long remain inactive:
<note>452</note> Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigern being preſſed by his enemies from the north, they marched againſt the Scots and Picts, who had advanced as far as Stamford in Lincolnſhire, when a battle enſued, in which the Saxons and Britons ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a complete victory; after which the Saxons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the place of their deſtination, where they were ſupplied with food and raiment at the expence of Vortigern, who would have had no cauſe perhaps to repent of their arrival, which were only about 1500; but their own country being populous, and withal ſo barren, and the fertile lands of Britain ſo agreeable and alluring, that, in a very little time, they were reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with 5000 men, formed the ambitious view of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſole maſters of England, and induſtriouſly ſought an occaſion of quarrel, and, after ſome ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles for victory,
<note>477</note> the laſt of which was an incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Saxons under Hengiſt and Eſca, the Britons were defeated, and became the ſubjects of the Saxons. This was an event not only prejudicial in general to the liberties and properties of Britain, but to ſcience and religion in particular. Vortigern was
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0010800101:412"/>by this time become a contemptible partiſan of the Saxons, and ſo immerſed in vice and debauchery, that St. Germanus, deputy of the Gallican church in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, reprimanded him for his diſſolute life; that he was anathematiſed in a council of the Britiſh clergy, and his ſubjects diſcharged of their allegiance.</p>
               <p>And whatever the ſtate of knowledge might be in this iſland before the introduction of the Saxons, it certainly received a great change for the worſe at that period. The repeated invaſions of thoſe barbarians, the wars they raiſed, and the deſolations they occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, ſpread a general conſuſion, diſperſed the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons to the remoteſt parts of the country, deſtroyed the monuments of learning, and left no room for the improvement and cultivation of the mind.</p>

The ſchools founded by Dubricius and Iltutus in North Wales, produced ſeveral men whoſe names have been tranſmitted with honour to poſterity; though in fact we are but little acquainted with their real attainments. Among theſe were Patrick and David, who exerted themſelves much in preaching the goſpel, and whom the ſuperſtition of latter ages hath advanced into tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary ſaints, the firſt of Ireland, and the ſecond of Wales. The monaſtery of Bangor was particularly famous for the education of youth. A number of ſcholars were brought up in it, who made ſome figure in their days; and among the reſt Gildas, who wrote a treatiſe upon the deſtruction of Britain, and from whom we principally derive our information concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of things during the latter end of the fifth, and part of the ſixth century.</p>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0010800101:413"/>groſſeſt idolatry, and they ſacrificed priſoners of war to the Gods. The firſt circumſtance of any note among them, was, the reception of the goſpel by Ethelbert, the King of Kent, and his ſubjects. His Queen Bertha, who was daughter or niece to Chilperic, King of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, and a Chriſtian, had, together with Lindhard, a biſhop, as it is ſaid, of piety and learning, who attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her from France, prepared the way for this great event, by converting ſeveral perſons, and by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a favourable diſpoſition in the mind of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. But the grand work was carried on by Auſtin, and other monks, ſent by Pope Gregory from Rome. One thing in this affair deſerves to be taken notice of, which is, that Ethelbert, whether it was owing to the good impreſſions of his lady, or the natural dictates of reaſon working in his own rude, but unprejudiced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, allowed to his people the utmoſt liberty of conſcience. He treated the miſſionaries with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, heard them with attention, and permitted them to propagate their doctrines without interruption; both before and after he had embraced chriſtianity, he left his ſubjects to an entire freedom of judging and acting for themſelves. His converſion, however, was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by that of the whole nation; a fact the leſs to be wondered at, when we conſider that the barbarians, having no ſettled ſentiments, are in general ready to receive any which are offered by ſuch as excel them in knowledge, and eſpecially when encouraged by their own prince. This is confirmed by a variety of inſtances in the hiſtory of the world; for we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always find, that the ignorant and upoliſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors of a civilized country ſubmitted, without much heſitation, to the religion of the people they had ſubdued.</p>
               <p>As to the change that was produced by Auſtin and his attendants in the principles and manners of the Saxons, it was not, to ſpeak the moſt favourably of it, by any means ſo happy an alteration as would have
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0010800101:414"/>been brought about, had the goſpel been preached in purer ages. The truth at that age was mixed with ſo much error and ſuperſtition, that the underſtanding of our anceſtors could not be ſo greatly enlarged, by the reception of chriſtianity, as at firſt we might be apt to ſuppoſe; for, however upright the intentions of Auſtin might be, it is evident by many inſtances that he was a very weak man.</p>
               <p>Auſtin, otherwiſe called Auguſtin, arrived in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the year 591 as a ſimple monk and miſſionary; ſoon after which he was honoured with the Pope's pall, and created biſhop of Canterbury. In this character he obtained no ſmall influence over Ethelbert, and was the inſtrument of his converſion to chriſtianity. He very ſoon after aſſumed the pomp and authority of a patriarchal metropolian, or apoſtle of the Engliſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was indeed conſecrated as ſuch at Arles, to which he made a voyage for that purpoſe; and at his return to Britain he ſent Laurentius, with a monk cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Peter, to make the Pope acquainted with the ſucceſs of his labours, and deſire his opinion and direction touching certain points relating to the behaviour of the biſhops and clergy. His holineſs having conſidered and replied to the queſtions, which with their anſwers may be ſeen in Bede's hiſtory of the church, ſent over Melitus, Paulus, Juſtus, Melinus, and Ruſinianus, to aſſiſt him in converting the Saxons; at the ſame time he tranſmitted directions about erecting ſees among the new convents, with a pall for Auguſtin, which is an undyed piece of woollen cloth, laid upon St. Peter's tomb by the Pope's own hand, and worn over the ſhoulders by the metropolitans when they officiate. Auguſtin was likewiſe permitted by his maſter to convert the Pagan temples into Chriſtian churches, after due purification, and to inſtitute anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſeſtivals of ſaints and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some have aſſerted, that Auſtin and ſome others, with more probability than Paulinus, baptiſed ten thouſand in one day. To which ſoever of them this fact is attributed, it is probable that theſe numerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions were too much like thoſe ſince carried on by popiſh miſſionaries, and conſiſted more in a change of outward profeſſion, than any real alteration of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, diſpoſitions, and manners. This is farther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from the Saxons being allowed to retain many of their Pagan cuſtoms and rites of worſhip, provided they applied them to other objects; a permiſſion which, though calculated to anſwer political purpoſes, was directly contrary to the practice of the apoſtles, and in its very nature deſtructive to the progreſs of true religion.</p>
               <p>As for Ethelbert, he was become ſo zealous a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, that he bequeathed his own palace to the church, and retired to Reculver, that Auguſtin might be more at his eaſe at Canterbury. Notwithſtanding all theſe favours, and the princely magnificence in which he lived, this pious apoſtle could enjoy no content while the Britiſh clergy lived independent of his authority, and unſubjected to the ſee of Rome.</p>
               <p>Independent, therefore, of the deſire which Auſtin had to diffuſe the light of the goſpel in general, we find he was particularly zealous for his own authority, and extremely ſolicitous to ſubject the Britiſh Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, in the remote parts of the iſland, to his metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan juriſdiction, and to the doctrines and diſcipline of the ſee of Rome. This is a circumſtance the more remarkable, as the Britiſh biſhops of that age had more enlarged views of things: accordingly they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed all ſubmiſſion to the Roman church, and nobly aſſerted their independence

<note n="†" place="bottom">Spelman in conciliis.</note>, who ſays, that Auſtin, by the aid of Ethelbert, King of Kent, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a council of Saxon and Britiſh biſhops, to meet in the confines of the Mercians, on the borders of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire and Herefordſhire, who met under an oak, in imitation of the pagan Britons, and performed their ſuperſtitions, as an imitation, and yet a correction, of their idolatry. He inſiſted upon their keeping the feſtival of Eaſter, and adminiſtering the ſacraments after the manner of the Roman church, and this with all the haughtineſs of a Roman Emperor. The Britiſh biſhops, and many learned men, differing from the Romiſh prieſt, rejected his traditions which he brought from Rome, and deteſted his pride, renounced his authority, and would not accept of him for their archbiſhop, as he deſired to be, and for the ſpace of an hunderd years at leaſt refuſed to communicate with thoſe that had received theſe traditions and devices. Then the biſhops and churches of Scotland joined with the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons againſt thoſe new obſervances, which the ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin brought from Rome. At that time there were near a thouſand monks at the monaſtery at Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor in Wales, who diſtinguiſhed themſelves for their ſobriety, ſupporting themſelves by labour, and ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their leiſure hours in prayer and meditation. Over that church at Auſtin's coming was Dinochus, a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, who, when Auſtin required the Britiſh biſhops to be ſubject to his Romiſh authority, proved, by many arguments, that they did not owe him any ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; whereat Auguſtin, being highly offended, is ſaid to have ſpoken to the following effect: "That if they would not accept of peace with their brethren, they ſhould receive war from their enemies; and ſeeing they would not join with him, in preaching the way of life to the Saxons, they ſhould feel the weight of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſword."

               <p>Auguſtin did not long ſurvive this ineffectual effort; but, before his death, he conſecrated his fellow miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries Melitus and Juſtus; the firſt of whom was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained biſhop of London, and the other promoted to the ſee of Rocheſter:

<note>619.</note> yet it was in a great meaſure owing to others. The Weſt Saxons were converted to chriſtianity by Berinius, who was inveſted by the Pope with the epiſcopal dignity for that purpoſe, independent of Auguſtin and his coadjutors; and particularly in the kingdom of Eaſt Anglia, Northumberland and Mercia. For before this period Paulinus had begun to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate chriſtianity among the inhabitants of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, by the aſſiſtance of Ethelburga the wiſe of King Edwin; but the ſlaughter of that Prince ſoon overturned all that had been done, and the nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted back to idolatry; afterwards when, Oſwald, one of his ſucceſſors, was deſirous of converting his ſubjects, he ſent to the Scotch monaſtery, from whence at length he received Aidan; a perſon who deſerves to be raiſed from the obſcurity of the times, and to be mentioned with ſingular veneration and eſteem, ſince he was not only learned as any of his cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, but took peculiar care to have ſchools erected for the education of youth: he likewiſe earneſtly recommended, both to the clergy and laity, a diligent and conſtant ſtudy of the ſcriptures; being ſenſible that this was the only way of promoting a genuine and rational knowledge of divine truths, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent practice of religion.

They continued in force a conſiderable time, and at length became the foundation of the code eſtabliſhed by Alfred. But excellent as Ina was in ſeveral reſpects, he diſgraced himſelf by an abſurd ſuperſtition, and introduced into his dominions the tax called Peter's pence, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards extended through all England.</p>
               <p>Urged by miſtaken notions of religion, he reſigned his crown, and took a journey to Rome, in order to confer with Pope Gregory II.

               <p>A little before the reign of Ina there flouriſhed in Kent, Theodore, a native of Tarſus, and archbiſhop of Canterbury.

There is ſomething in the ſtile and manner of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who lived at that period, which is ſuperior to the authors who preceded or came after them for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ages; and then flouriſhed a ſet of men, who, all things conſidered, deſerved a large ſhare of reputation. Egbert, archbiſhop of York, was famous as a great collector of books, a ſcholar, and a patron of literature. Eddius compoſed the life of biſhop Wilfrid in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taſte of language than had hitherto been cuſtomary. Acca produced a number of theological pieces.</p>
               <p>But of all the eminent perſons that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned this aera,

                  </note> Bede was the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious; and indeed, notwithſtanding the defects of his works, which are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to the defects of the times, he was really an extraordinary man. He was the firſt who wrote a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular eccleſiaſtical hiſtory; and though it is too full of fables and falſe miracles, it ſtill continues to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable. Nor was his knowledge confined to divinity and the annals of the church, but reached to the arts and ſciences in general; to grammar, aſtronomy, chronology, natural philoſophy, and ethics. It is true, his treatiſes on theſe ſubjects will be ſound very imperfect, when compared with the enlightened pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of modern ages; nevertheleſs, they prove him to have had an uncommon genius and application. He obtained when young the appellation of Venerable, and will always be regarded as a character that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to peculiar honour and eſteem.</p>
               <p>Bede was the luminary of the north, where he conſtantly lived; and next to him in reputation was Aldhelm, who was ſomething before him in point of

It is univerſally agreed he was the firſt Engliſhman who compoſed in Latin; none having heretofore done it, in this iſland, but ſuch as were either foreigners from the continent, or Iriſh, or Scots, or Britons: he has likewiſe himſelf aſſured us, that he was the firſt who introduced poetry among the Saxons, and who wrote upon the meaſure of verſes.

However ſuch was the zeal of Wilfred, that the merit of converting the South Saxons is aſcribed to him, after his expulſion from the ſee of York; and though he is ſaid to have confirmed his doctrines by miracles, his great ſucceſs ſeems to have been owing to the favourable diſpoſition of Adel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walch, who had already embraced the Chriſtian faith, and to the great influence Wilfred acquired among the common people.</p>
               <p>The archbiſhop of Canterbury not only endeavoured to extend his juriſdiction over the Britiſh church, but alſo to reduce the Scottiſh clergy to the dominion of the Pope.

This was a ſtroke aimed at the Britons and Scots, who celebrated that feſtival by another rule; and two biſhops from Icolm-kill had prevailed upon the Northumbrians to adopt their uſage in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, though they had been converted by Roman
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0010800101:426"/>miſſionaries. Oſwy, King of that country, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference as a ſubject of great importance, propoſed a conference at Whitby in Yorkſhire, between Colman, one of the Scottiſh prelates, ſupported by ſeveral monks of his nation, and Wilfred, who had already brought over the Queen to his opinion. The diſpute was of conſequence decided in favour of this courtly abbot; while Colman and his party recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their preferment, and retired to Scotland.</p>
               <p>About the year A. D. 709, a ſynod was held at Alanceſter, in Worceſterſhire, to promote the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Eveſham abbey, which was done accordingly; and the ſame was bountifully endowed by Offa, and other Mercian kings, with large revenues. Not long after another ſynod was called at London, to introduce into England the practice of image-worſhip, which as yet was no public practice. Much about the ſame time it became faſhionable for the Kings and Queens of England to turn monks and nuns, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into convents; ſo that in the ſpace of a few years nine diſtinguiſhed themſelves by this monkiſh practice. From hence we may likewiſe aſſert, that the Romiſh power and ſuperſtition gained ground in the Engliſh nations. Aldhelm, biſhop of Sherborn, wrote a book in favour of the Romiſh time, and manner of celebrating Eaſter, which had no ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the minds of the people.</p>
               <p>The ſee of Canterbury was at the death of Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert filled with Bridwin, a noble Saxon, of remarkable piety and diſcretion. But he ſurvived but three years, when Adulph being elected archbiſhop, received the pall from Pope Paul V. This prelate exerted all his intereſt and induſtry to prevent Offa, King of the Mercians, from erecting an archiepiſcopal ſee within his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, by which his own metropolitanical power would be diſmembered; but Pope Adrian, to whom the diſpute was referred, decided in favour of Offa, whom he empowered to erect Litchfield into an archbiſhopric,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0010800101:427"/>to which all the Mercian biſhops were declared ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragans.</p>
               <p>This was the laſt blow given to the independency of the Britiſh church, for it fixed Offa and his new elected archbiſhop Adulph, in the intereſt of Rome, which was ſo ſenſible of the great influence it had gained by this compliance with Offa's ambition, that the Pope ſent Gregory biſhop of Oſtia, and Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact, another prelate, in quality of legates to England. Theſe came on pretence of reforming the diſcipline of the Engliſh church, and executing the partition of the metropolitanical power of Canterbury. A ſynod was accordingly held in Northumberland, and gave an aſſent to all the articles which had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prepared by the legates. Theſe were in effect little more than a confirmation of canons, which had formerly received the ſanction of the church, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing however two new articles, one of which is an admonition to kings to reſpect the clergy, and the other a caution to the people againſt chuſing illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſovereigns. The decrees of this ſynod were afterwards confirmed by another, held at Calcluith, which was more frequent and full than the other, and Adulph received the pall from Rome, without Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert's daring to murmur, for fear of being impeached of treaſonable practices.</p>
               <p>Offa having exerted himſelf ſo much in favour of the church, was conſidered in other countries as a very religious Prince, and received from Charlemagne the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the ſecond councils of Nice, recommending image-worſhip, againſt which the famous Alcuin, who was an Engliſhman, and a tutor to Charlemagne, had writ with great energy and learning. Indeed his performance had a remarkable effect among the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, for by means of it image-worſhip was ſolemnly condemned at the council of Frankfort

               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0010800101:428"/>Several ſynods were ſucceſſively held at Canterbury, at Cloveſhoo, at Calcluith, and another afterwards at Cloveſhoo, all relating to matters of a beneficiary nature, and to the prerogative of the Pope or Princes.</p>
               <p>In the year of our Lord 747,
<note>Decrees of the ſynod of Cloveſhoo, A. D. <hi>747.</hi>
                  </note> there was a famous ſynod held at Cloveſhoo, or Clyff, near Rocheſter in Kent. The matter of the debate related to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcipline of the church. This ſynod was compoſed of twelve Engliſh prelates; Ethelbald like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe King of the Mercians, and the temporal nobility, were preſent at it, and many of the clergy. The following compendium of the decrees of this ſynod will afford us an idea of the ſtate of religion at that time.</p>
               <p>At the opening of the ſynod, Pope Zachary's letters were firſt read in the original by archbiſhop Cuthbert, and then tranſlated to the audience. In theſe letters, as <hi>Malmsbury</hi> relates, the Pope admoniſhed the Engliſh clergy to reform their lives, and threatened thoſe with excommunication that continued in their irregularities.</p>
               <p>This preliminary being over, the biſhops proceeded to draw up a body of canons, ſome of which I ſhall mention.</p>
               <p>1ſt, It was decreed, that every biſhop ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſupport his character, execute every part of his office, and maintain the canons and conſtitutions of the church, againſt all ſort of liberty or encroachment. And that thoſe of this order ſhould anſwer the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of their ſtations, nor engage in ſecular affairs ſo far as to be diſabled for their functions; but to be remarkably eminent for their probity, ſelf-denial, and learning; that by this means they may be qualified to make an impreſſion upon the people, both by their inſtructions, and by their practice.</p>
               <p>2dly, That the prelates and clergy ſhould be careful to keep a good correſpondence with each other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any flattering applications to any perſon; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are the ſervants of the ſame maſter, and intruſted with the ſame commiſſion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0010800101:429"/>though they are divided by diſtance of place and country, they ought to be united in affection, and pray for each other, that every one may diſcharge his office with integrity and conſcience.</p>
               <p>Theſe two canons, but eſpecially the laſt, ſeem to be drawn on purpoſe to guard the liberties of the Engliſh church againſt the pretenſions of Rome, and to throw off that precedent of ſervitude, which <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> had ſet them in his letter to archbiſhop <hi>Cuthbert.</hi> It is true, they do not mention the Pope; but by obliging the biſhops to ſtand up in defence of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient canons, not to flatter any perſon upon the ſcore of his eccleſiaſtical diſtinction, becauſe the biſhops have all of them the honour of the ſame commiſſion and employment; theſe general glances, with the grounds, upon which they ſtand, ſeem plainly deſigned to fence againſt that ſubmiſſion to the papal chair which Boniface recommended.</p>
               <p>3dly, That the reſpective biſhops ſhould viſit their dioceſe every year, call the people of all ranks and conditions together, and be particularly careful to preach to thoſe, who lie moſt out of the way of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and not ſuffer any unwarrantable and heatheniſh cuſtoms, ſuch as divination, amulets, charms, &amp;c. to continue in the dioceſe.</p>
               <p>The fourth, fifth, and ſeventh, relate to the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of monaſteries. The ſixth orders the biſhops not to ordain any prieſt, without a previous exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon the points of learning and morals.</p>
               <p>The eighth puts the prieſts in mind of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their character, and the buſineſs for which they were ordained. That they ought to abſtract themſelves from the world as much as may be, and ſpend their time in reading, prayer and exhortation, and other exerciſes of religion; and, more particularly in the next canon, they are enjoined to preach, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and inſpect the manners of the laity in thoſe precincts and diviſions aſſigned them by their reſpective
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0010800101:430"/>biſhops. From hence it appears, that the ſubdiviſions of the dioceſes were in ſome meaſure formed, and the lines of pariſhes ſtruck out.</p>
               <p>The tenth canon orders the prieſts to be thoroughly acquainted with the doctrine and ſervice of the church; to teach the creed and Lord's prayer in Engliſh, and explain the ſacraments to the people. This direction is agreeable to Bede's advice to <hi>Egbert</hi> biſhop of York; where he tells him, that both the clergy and laity ought to have the creed and Lord's prayer by heart; and that himſelf had tranſlated them into Engliſh for the advantage of the common people, and thoſe that did not underſtand Latin.</p>
               <p>In the eleventh canon, the prieſts are enjoined to be uniform in the exerciſe of their function, and to baptiſe, preach and govern with the ſame rules and meaſures.</p>
               <p>The twelfth regulates the church-muſic, provides for the ſolemnity of the performance, and forbids the clergy to profane the ſervice with the air of the theatre. And in the cloſe of the canon, the prieſts are enjoined to keep within the bounds of their order, and not to do any thing which belongs to the biſhop.</p>
               <p>By the thirteenth, the holy days are to be kept every where on the ſame day, and the time to be governed by the Roman martyrology.</p>
               <p>The fourteenth provides for the religious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Sunday or Lord's day, that it ought to be wholly dedicated to God's ſervice; that all ſecular buſineſs and travelling, unleſs in caſe of neceſſity, ought to be forborn; that the people are to be called to church to hear the word of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſacraments.</p>
               <p>The fifteenth orders the ſeven canonical hours of prayer ſhould be conſtantly obſerved according to cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and that nothing ſhould be introduced but what
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0010800101:431"/>is warrantable by the authority of ſcripture, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the practice of the Roman church.</p>
               <p>By the ſixteenth, the litanies or rogations are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to be kept with great ſolemnity by the clergy and people; that which is called the great litany, by the Romiſh church, is ordered to be kept the twenty-fourth day of April.</p>
               <p>The other, which ſtands upon the antient practice of the iſland, falls three days before our Saviour's aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; on which divine ſervice is to be performed, and the people to faſt till three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>By the ſeventeenth, the days on which St. Gregory the Great, and Auguſtin, archbiſhop of Canterbury, died, are to be made holy-days; and that in ſinging the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, the name of Auguſtine ſhall be mentioned after St. Gregory.</p>
               <p>The eighteenth canon provides for the ſolemn times of faſting in Ember-weeks: and that the people ſhould have notice given to provide themſelves.</p>
               <p>The nineteenth and twentieth relate to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and behaviour of monaſteries, with reſpect to habit, company and employment.</p>
               <p>The twenty-firſt is levelled againſt drunkenneſs, luxury, and inſobriety of converſation.</p>
               <p>The twenty-ſecond, enjoins the religious to live in a conſtant preparation for the receiving the ſacrament of the holy euchariſt, or the body and blood of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as the canon words expreſs it.</p>
               <p>From hence I ſhall paſs to the twenty-fifth, by which the biſhops, at their coming from their ſynod, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to convene the prieſts and abbots of their dioceſes, to publiſh the canons of the council, and command their obſervance. And if any diſorder proves too ſtrong for the biſhop's correction, he is to acquaint the archbiſhop with it at the meeting of the next ſynod. But not a word of carrying the complaint farther to Rome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0010800101:432"/>The twenty-ſixth ſtates the right uſe of charity, and provides againſt wrong views and miſapplications in this duty; and here the ſynod declares, that alms are not given to commute for <hi>penance,</hi> to diſpenſe with the diſcipline of the church, or procure us a liberty for ſinning: that thoſe who think the juſtice of God can be bribed in this manner, make their charity inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and bring an addition to their guilt: that alms ſignifies <hi>mercy</hi> both in the name and thing; and that they are no leſs a charity to the giver than to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. And therefore he that has a true compaſſion for his own ſoul, ſhould always give that which is his own, and not circumvent or oppreſs one neighbour to be charitable to another.</p>
               <p>The twenty-ſeventh dilates upon the uſefulneſs, and directs in the manner and qualifications, of ſinging pſalms. That this part of divine ſervice ought to be performed with due recollection, with pious diſpoſitions and poſtures of reſpect; and, after the ſinging is ended, there are prayers mentioned both for the living and the dead; and thoſe that do not underſtand Latin, are to pray in the vulgar tongue. The prayer for the dead runs thus: <hi>O Lord, we beſeech thee, for thy great mercy, grant that the ſoul of</hi> ſuch a perſon <hi>may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in a ſtate of indiſturbance and repoſe; and that he may be admitted, with the reſt of thy ſaints, into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of light and happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This canon, like the laſt, puts the people in mind not to depend upon the performance of one branch of duty, to the neglect of another. It ſeems ſome people began to believe that one good action was a ſort of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation in other caſes; and, which was ſtill more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, they fancied they might perform their duty by proxy, built upon foreign merit, and be good by the virtue of their neighbours. The canon is the larger in expoſing the vanity and danger of this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, becauſe they had a large inſtance of ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable expectation in a layman of condition.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0010800101:433"/>This perſon, it ſeems, had forfeited the communion of the church, and was put under diſcipline for ſome great crime: now he deſired the rigour of his penance might be taken off, and that he might be reconciled upon the ſuggeſtion following. He acquainted thoſe ſpiritual directors he belonged to, that he had procured ſeveral perſons to faſt, ſing pſalms, and diſtribute cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity on his account; ſo that if he was to live three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, there was enough done for him by other good people, though he ſhould do little or nothing himſelf: but the canon declares, with great indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, againſt the folly of ſuch a preſumption.</p>
               <p>The laſt <hi>canon</hi> enjoins, That Kings and Princes, and the whole body of the commonwealth, ſhall be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly prayed for in the church.</p>
               <p>The biſhops names that ſat in this ſynod were, Cuthbert, archbiſhop of Canterbury; Dunnus, biſhop of Rocheſter, &amp;c.; and Podda, biſhop of Leiceſter, &amp;c. Linſey, who governed the ſees of Wincheſter, Sherborne, &amp;c. in the kingdom of the Weſt Saxons; Herdulp, biſhop of Dunwich and Helman; Egwulf, biſhop of London; Milred, of Worceſter; Alwi, of Lindſey; and Sigga, of Selcey in Suſſex: but Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, being of the royal family and brother to King Eadbert, was not there.</p>
               <p>When the ſynod broke up, archbiſhop Cuthbert diſpatched his deacon to give Boniface, archbiſhop of Mentz, an account of what was done, purſuant to the true intent and deſign thereof by Ethelbald, and thoſe biſhops who acceded to its convention, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the decrees by their ſubſcription

               <p>About the year 755, Kenulphus, King of the Weſt Saxons, conferred large privileges on the monaſtery of Abingdon, in Berkſhire, A. D. 758, and dead bodies were firſt admitted to be buried in churches, which by degrees brought in great ſuperſtition

                  </note> the Danes firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded England with a conſiderable army. Lindesfern or holy iſland was the firſt that felt the fury of theſe Pagans, but ſoon after no place was ſecure from their cruelty.</p>
               <p>ETHELBERT VI. King of the Eaſt Saxons, went to marry the daughter of Offa, and Offa perfidiouſly cauſed him to be murdered, after which to commute for his ſin he gave the tenth part of all he had to the church, and ſeveral lands to the ſee of Hereford, and then he went to Rome, repaired, beautified and richly endowed the Engliſh monaſtery, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to Pope Adrian the gift of Peter pence; then was the corps of St. Alban, in a pompous manner, taken up, inſhrined and adored by the ſpectators. Offa likewiſe procured the canonization of St. Alban, the abſolution of his own ſins and many murders, and then returning home founded the monaſtery of St. Alban, beſtowed great riches upon it in lands, exempted it from paying Peter-pence, epiſcopal juriſdiction, and the like, and died the next year.</p>

                  <head>EGBERT, <hi>the Firſt King of England,</hi> A. D. 800.</head>
                  <p>Egbert, King of the Weſt Saxons, in the year 800, having vanquiſhed Mercia, Kent, Eſſex, and Northumberland, received a general invitation to accept the ſovereignty of England, both in church and ſtate; in conſequence of which he returned and mounted the throne of Weſſex, and began to reign over a people both rich and powerful, in whoſe affluence and affection he foreſaw his own future greatneſs. He had, in all probability, already planned the union of the heptarchy; but before he would impart the leaſt hint of that deſign to the other Saxon nations, he reſolved to humble the Britons in ſuch a manner that they ſhould be in no condition
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0010800101:435"/>to interfere with the execution of his grand project. Mean while, in order to avert the ſuſpicion of the Saxons, he acted as a mediator in all the differences ſubſiſting between the princes of the heptarchy, and in particular effected a reconciliation between Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulf King of Northumberland, and Kenulf King of Mercia, who had taken the field againſt each other, and were on the eve of terminating their quarrel by the ſword.</p>
                  <p>Theſe good offices; employed with ſuch moderation, the prudence he manifeſted in his own government, and known capacity in the affairs of war and peace, raiſed his character to ſuch a degree of reputation, that he was conſidered as the father of the Engliſh nation, and choſen chief of the Saxon heptarchy.</p>
                  <p>Egbert having united the heptarchy, was ſo engaged by continual wars, that he had very little time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to eccleſiaſtical affairs; and theſe troubles detached the people ſo much from the practice and ſtudy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties, that the whole nation was overſpread with ignorance, and a total relaxation of morals enſued. During this reign, however, Withlaf, the tributary King of Mercia, granted to the abbey of Croyland a famous charter, which was confirmed by the ſtates of the kingdom. Among other privileges and exemptions contained in this charter, it ordained that the monaſtery of Croyland ſhould be held as a ſanctuary, which no officer of juſtice ſhould preſume to violate, on pain of loſing his right foot; and that the abbots and monks ſhould be entertained through all parts of Mercia, with all the honours and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion due to a prince of the blood. This deed was confirmed by Egbert, and ſeems to have been the only eccleſiaſtical tranſaction of his reign: but his ſucceſſor Ethelwulf, who was entirely governed by the clergy, and left the adminiſtration to Swithin, biſhop of Wincheſter, extended his compliance to the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0010800101:436"/>church farther than it had ever been carried by any of his predeceſſors, and beſtowed upon it the tythes of all England, in an authentic charter, confirmed in a general aſſembly at Wincheſter, and ſigned by the ſubſtituted kings of Mercia and Eaſt Anglia.</p>
                  <p>It might naturally be expected, that when the ſeven kingdoms came under the dominion of one Prince, the ſtate of things would grow better, and knowledge begin to revive in England: but the fact was far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and if we enquire into the cauſes of it, ſeveral circumſtances will be found that contributed to the production of the contrary event; the wars carried on by Egbert againſt his neighbours gave riſe to much confuſion and deſolation, and when he had reduced the nation under his government, it would be ſtill a conſiderable time before affairs would be brought into ſo peaceable and flouriſhing a condition, as was neceſſary to the progreſs of learning. Moreover, the ſpirit of the age was directly oppoſite to literary improvement, an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ignorance prevailed, and there was no thought about the cultivation and improvement of human nature. To this concurred the abſurd ſentiments that were propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with regard to religion, and the enormous power and influence of the clergy, which could only be ſupported by the ignorance and ſtupidity of the people. Indeed the ſituation of the whole world, during this period, and for many centuries, afford a ſtrong proof, that where the ſcriptures are neglected, and rational prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples concerning religious matters totally excluded, the other branches of ſcience, and the faculties of the mind in general, will greatly ſuffer. It may perhaps be ſuppoſed that the monaſteries had a tendency to preſerve and favour literature: but whatever their tendency was, they had in reality rather a contrary effect; they were not examples of piety, or ſeats of the muſes; the perſons who reſided in them did not ſix upon them as retreats to awaken their devotion, and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0010800101:437"/>enlarge their underſtanding, but as places where they might live exempt from military ſervice, and ſecurely indulge their luſt and vices; ſo that monaſteries were little elſe than the abodes of wickedneſs. Bede com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of them again and again in his writings, and he has told us they were in ſo corrupt a ſtate, that ſuch as deſired to be ſincerely pious were obliged to go abroad for education
<note n="*" place="bottom">Library, p. 180.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Bede likewiſe informs us, that the Chriſtian church at that time was far gone from its original purity; for the monks had introduced ſeveral practices into the church, which were not of apoſtolic inſtitution, making uſe of every means in their power to inſpire people with great reverence for the Pope of Rome, and to an high veneration for monaſteries, ſo that it is ſurpriſing how many was erected, and how richly they were endowed even in the infancy of the church.</p>
                  <p>The reigns of <hi>Ethelbald, Ethelbert,</hi> and <hi>Ethelred</hi> I. are very barren of all eccleſiaſtical matter; except the deſtruction of monaſteries by the Danies, which the hiſtorians in thoſe days have deſcribed in very pathetic terms; regretting in particular the three famous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of Croyland, Ely, and Maderhamſtede, in which the monks were maſſacred, and their libraries burned. We have already obſerved that the cruelty of the Danes was ſo inveterate againſt every perſon apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the culture of the Chriſtian religion, that thoſe few monks who eſcaped their barbarity, either quitted the kingdom, or had recourſe to other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments for a livelihood, when they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deprived of the revenues upon which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſubſiſted; ſo that <hi>Alfred</hi> the Great, when he triumphed over thoſe invaders, could find no monks in England, and was obliged to repleniſh the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries he built with eccleſiaſtics invited from foreign countries. This great prince, who contributed ſo
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0010800101:438"/>much to the reſtoration of learning and religion, enacted many eccleſiaſtical as well as civil inſtitutions. The firſt part of theſe is little more than a tranſcript of the decalogue, omitting the ſecond commandment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe repugnant to image-worſhip, which had by this time gained footing in England. Theſe are followed by an abridgment of the regulations inſtituted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as recorded in the book of Exodus; and a recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the goſpel-diſpenſation; after which we find a ſhort introduction to his code of civil laws, collected from thoſe of <hi>Ina, Offa,</hi> and <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> the firſt of all the Saxon Kings who were converted to chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity.</p>
                  <p>Another hiſtorian gives us much the ſame account. Introductory to the character of Alfred, he obſerves, that the grand circumſtance which deſtroyed the very traces of knowledge, and cut it up by the roots, was the invaſion of the Danes, which ſo ſoon ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the abolition of the heptarchy, that there was no time to bring the kingdom into order and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. In conſequence of the numerous and repeated attacks of that people, who were more barbarous than the Saxons, an almoſt univerſal ruin was ſpread through the iſland, and the monks were totally diſperſed, ſo that the few among them that had applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to uſeful learning, were driven away or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; the wiſdom they poſſeſſed, whatever it was, periſhed with them. Hence, with reſpect to the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of religion and learning, little can be recorded from the reign of Egbert to the reign of Alfred, who, when he came to the crown, found ſcience in ſo deplorable a condition, that he has himſelf aſſured us that he ſcarce remembered one man on the ſouth ſide the Humber who underſtood his prayers in the Engliſh tongue, or could tranſlate a piece of Latin into his native language

                  <head>ALFRED, A. D. 872.</head>
                  <p>When the Danes had already ſubdued Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland and Eaſt Anglia, and gained footing in the very heart of Weſſex, all the churches and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries burnt, and the whole country depopulated, Alfred ſeaſonably and ſucceſsfully aſſumed the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of King, and merited that of father to his people
<note n="*" place="bottom">Smollet, p. 249.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Were it not for Alfred the period we are writing of would hardly deſerve to be mentioned;
<note>Alfred's character.</note> but he has thrown a mighty luſtre upon it, for in him we meet with abilities and accompliſhments that are truly aſtoniſhing. If we had materials, it would be very delightful to trace the ſteps by which ſuch a mind advanced to maturity, to mark the incidents that awakened the vigour of his genius, and rendered him ſo diſtinguiſhed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened in a barbarous age, and amidſt a ſcene of general diſcord. We are informed, that when he was very young, he was twice at Rome, and perhaps a perſecuting impreſſion might be made upon him, while in that famous city: for though Rome itſelf was then in an exceeding low ſtate of ſcience, compared with what it had formerly been; yet it was vaſtly ſuperior in this reſpect to the dark and frozen regions of the north. But whatever impreſſions Alfred might receive at that place, no immediate advancement in knowledge ſeems to have been the reſult of them; for we are told his education was ſo far neglected, that he did not learn to read till he was twelve years of age; but when he had made a beginning, his capacity and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity was ſuch, that his progreſs was equally ſurpriſing.</p>
                  <p>He was undoubtedly in every inſtance one of the moſt illuſtrious characters recorded in hiſtory, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly remains to this day the peculiar favourite of the Engliſh nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0010800101:440"/>With regard to his perſonal character, we ſhall find that he was ſuperior to any man of his time; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a poet and mathematician, ſuch was his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire for the cultivation of his mind, that he always retained about him the moſt accompliſhed ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars he could meet with, with whom he perpetually engaged in literary enquiries and purſuits.</p>
                  <p>Nor was his wiſdom locked up in his own breaſt, and reſerved merely for his private entertainment, but was diffuſed around him in a plentiful manner. He was extremely ſolicitous to have his ſubjects enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and improved; and ſought out methods that could contribute to ſo deſirable an effect. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, one of his firſt ſteps was to invite from the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh monaſteries, and from the continent, as many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men as poſſible, whom he received and treated with great marks of friendſhip, and in concurrence with them erected a number of ſchools for the inſtruction of his people.</p>
                  <p>Among the learned ſtrangers who aſſiſted <hi>Alfred</hi> in his great work of reſtoring the luſtre of the church, and reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the arts and ſciences, the principal were, Johannes Scotus Erigena, an Iriſh Scot, who had ſtudied at Athens and other foreign countries, and made himſelf maſter of the Greek and oriental languages; he then repaired thro' Italy to France, where he acquired an eminent degree of favour and familiarity with Charles the Bald; and the fame of his talents extending to England, he was invited hither by Alfred, whom he inſtructed in the liberal arts, and whoſe friendſhip he enjoyed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his oppoſition to the doctrine of tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, which rendered him obnoxious to the ſee of Rome. Towards the latter part of his life, he opened a ſchool in the monaſtery of Malmeſbury, where his ſcholars murdered him with their penknives; though we are ignorant of the occaſion. Another foreigner, for whom <hi>Alſred</hi> conceived a very early affection, was one <hi>Grimbald,</hi> who entertained him ſo hoſpitably in
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0010800101:441"/>his journey to Rome, that he afterwards created him abbot of Wincheſter. He was a learned divine, well ſkilled in muſic, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf for his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents in oratory. The firſt abbot of the new abbey, founded in the iſle of Ethelney, was a native of Old Saxony, and almoſt all the monks, prieſts, and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were foreigners; not but that his own country produced a number of men who diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their piety and erudition, namely, <hi>Aſſer Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevenis,</hi> a monk of St. David's, ſo attached to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, that all the careſſes and favours of Alfred could not prevail upon him to forſake it entirely, though he conſented to live one half-year with the King, who promoted him to the biſhopric of Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, and beſtowed upon him many other marks of his particular regard. Yet he muſt not be confounded with his name-ſake and uncle, Aſſerius, archbiſhop of St. David's, who wrote part of Alfred's life. <hi>John,</hi> the monk, belonging to the ſame monaſtery, to whoſe inſtruction the King owed his knowledge of the Latin tongue. <hi>Werefred,</hi> biſhop of Worceſter, who had been driven by the Danes into baniſhment; from whence he was recalled by Alfred, who had employed him to tranſlate Gregory's Dialogues. <hi>Plegmund,</hi> arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury; and <hi>Dunwulf,</hi> biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, who is ſaid by ſome authors to have been the very cow-herd whom <hi>Alfred</hi> ſerved in diſguiſe. That prince it ſeems diſcovered in him a genius far above his ſtation in life, which he exalted in proportion to his merit.</p>
                  <p>But of all the eccleſiaſtics who dignified the court of <hi>Alfred, Neotus,</hi> or St. <hi>Neot,</hi> was the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for his learning, piety, and example: in being deſcended from the blood royal of the Eaſt-Angles, he was reſpected as a prince as well as a prelate; and is ſaid, by his perſonal authority and admonitions, to have reſtricted the ſallies of Alfred's youth. He was buried at St. Guerer's church, at Gainſbury, in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0010800101:442"/>Cornwall; and ſuch at that time was the general opinion of his ſanctity, that he ſupplanted the Corniſh ſaint, and gave his own name to the church, which was thenceforward called <hi>Neotſtow.</hi> The palace of Earl Alric, in Huntingdonſhire, was afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a monaſtery, and dedicated to this ſaint, whoſe body was tranſlated thither; though not ſuffered to remain in this place neither, for, in the reign of King John, his bones were removed from this St. Neot to the abbey of Croyland. This eccleſiaſtic, and the greateſt part of thoſe above-mentioned, taught together in the univerſity of Oxford, which was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and endowed by Alfred, who frequently aſſiſted in perſon at their exerciſes, until ſome diſputes aroſe between the native and foreign profeſſors, and then Grimbald retired to the monaſtery at Wincheſter, which the King had lately founded
<note n="*" place="bottom">Smollet.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that the path of knowledge might be rendered ſtill eaſier to the Engliſh nation, Alfred em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the ableſt perſons who were about him, in writing ſuch books as were calculated for the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the multitude; a moſt judicious and uſeful ſcheme! and as there were but very few who were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of putting it into execution, he commenced au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf, and compoſed a variety of pieces; ſo great a variety, that we are aſtoniſhed at his finding leiſure to produce them in the midſt of the dangerous wars, and important public concerns, in which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually engaged.</p>
                  <p>The motive from which his literary performances took their riſe, does him honour: he did not write from a principle of vanity, but from a laudable view for the improvement and happineſs of mankind; and accordingly we find the matter of them were worthy of his character, as the prince and father of his country. Many of his compoſitions relate to the principles of government and laws; and others of them were calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0010800101:443"/>for the inſtruction of his people in general, adapted to inſpire them with devotion, to excite their attention to the moral virtues, and to provide for them innocent and inſtructive entertainment. Nor ſhould his method of doing it paſs unnoticed, as he employed the learned about him to give the general ſenſe of an author, and then gave it a dreſs beſt adapted to the taſte and to the apprehenſions of the public.</p>
                  <p>Nor did he confine his ſubjects to his own times, but in moſt of his undertakings extended his views to the welfare of poſterity: beſides the ſchools erected by him in different places, he prohibited any one from aſſuming the truſt and dignity of a magiſtrate who was not verſed in learning; and, that there might not be wanting a ſupply of men qualified to diſcharge the ſeveral offices of government, he compelled, by law, thoſe who had competent fortunes to give their children a proper education.</p>
                  <p>One principal object which ſhewed his regard to learning,
<note>Univerſity of Oxford founded by King Alfred.</note> and has rendered his name peculiarly illuſtrious, was his being the FOUNDER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD. We ſay the founder, though we are not inſenſible that ſome writers have contended for a higher antiquity, but, we think, not ſupported by ſufficient authority.</p>
                  <p>Alfred erected three halls, in each of which twenty-ſix ſcholars were educated. The ſciences taught were divinity, logic, muſic, geometry, aſtronomy, gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, and rhetoric; and the ableſt men of the age were appointed the teachers. Such was the beginning of Oxford as a ſeat of letters, and the reſidence of the muſes; and ſince that time it hath riſen to its utmoſt degree of ſplendor, and has become the largeſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in the world: it has no equal for the number and magnificence of its colleges and public buildings, the ſize and value of its libraries, the multitude of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors and pupils, and the variety of its endowments. It hath produced perſons eminent in all branches of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature;
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0010800101:444"/>claſſical and polite learning have appeared in it with peculiar luſtre; and it continues the habitation of ſubſtantial knowledge, true taſte, and national in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Alfred ſhines with equal, perhaps with greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as a legiſlator, than he doth as the friend and patron of letters in general; and not one of our Engliſh princes deſerve to be named with him in this reſpect: for, in order to provide for his ſubjects a full body of laws, he ſearched into the inſtitutions of foreign nations, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the regulations of the Britiſh Kings, and of his Saxon anceſtors, and drew from them what was moſt valuable and uſeful. It is much to be lamented that the code eſtabliſhed by him has not been tranſmitted to us entire; but enough of it remains to fill us with the warmeſt veneration for his memory, and to convince us that he had the nobleſt views for the happineſs of poſterity, as well as of his own times; and the natives of this iſland muſt owe him peculiar eſteem, ſince to him we are indebted for many of the moſt important privileges which, at the preſent day, conſtitutes the dignity and felicity of our political conſtitution
<note n="*" place="bottom">Library, p. 183. Rapin's Hiſt. vol. I. p. 14.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, with relation to his ſkill in the arts, and his attention to commerce, he was ſuperior to any monarch of the age: he erected cities, repaired pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, and applied himſelf diligently to the ſtudy of ſhip-building, ſo as to reduce it to a ſcience, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented veſſels of ſuch a conſtruction as enabled him to obtain the victory in ſeveral engagements with the Danes. From a motive of piety, and to relieve the Chriſtians of Malabar, he ſent perſons to the Eaſt-Indies, and his ſhips returned home with precious ſtones, perfumes, and other valuable commodities. It is likewiſe a certain fact, that he attempted the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a north-eaſt paſſage, and employed <hi>Octhar,</hi> a Dane, and <hi>Wolſtan,</hi> an Engliſhman, for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:0010800101:445"/>If we conſider the religion of Alfred, though no doubt it partook of the temper of the times, yet we have no reaſon to believe that it was remarkably ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious: there is nothing recorded of him which favours of the mean and monkiſh ſpirit obſervable in many preceding and ſucceeding princes; his piety was ever ſincere and fervent, and as rational as the period in which he lived would admit.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Alfred</hi> we may behold what amazing effects may be produced by the genius and abilities of one man. Such was the influence he had upon the nation, that, in a few years, it was transformed into quite another people: the Engliſh, from being cowardly, poor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable, and ignorant, became brave, rich, reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and, comparatively ſpeaking, knowing and polite; but they were governed by a prince who was almoſt a prodigy in every reſpect, and we muſt travel through ſeveral centuries before we ſhall find a character on which we can expatiate with equal pleaſure, and which does ſo much honour to human nature.</p>
                  <p>Though Alfred was a prodigy, yet his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements were much limited by the ignorance of the age; and he muſt neceſſarily be unacquainted with a thouſand things that are at preſent known by perſons of very moderate capacities. This too was the caſe with regard to the profeſſors and tutors appointed by him at Oxford and other places; they had not accurate and extenſive views of any ſcience, and therefore could not communicate ſuch views to their diſciples. Indeed it was not poſſible, in ſo dark a period, to make a large progreſs in philoſophy and ſound learning; the ſtate of religion, the prevailing manners of the world, the want of good examples, all ſtood in oppoſition to the advancement of real wiſdom: add to this, that the repeated invaſions of the Danes put a ſtop to the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of knowledge, and at length brought back an univerſal barbariſm. This great prince died in the fifty-ſecond year of his age, October 26, A. D. 900.</p>

                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:0010800101:446"/>As it would exceed the limits of this work to give a detail of the civil and eccleſiaſtical laws of this prince, the curious reader may refer to Collier's Eccleſ. Hiſt. Vol. I. book. iii. p. 163 to 169.</p>

                  <head>EDWARD, A. D. 900.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward, Alfred</hi>'s ſucceſſor, imitated the virtues of his father in a number of benefactions to the church; yet his reign is remarkable for a very particular exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the authority of the Roman ſee. Pope For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſus being informed that the biſhopric of Weſſex had been many years vacant, ſent over a bull, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the King, and all his ſubjects; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publickly read at a general aſſembly of the ſtates, by Plegmund, archbiſhop of Canterbury, the vacant ſees were immediately filled, and three new biſhoprics erected in Weſſex: then Plegmund ſet out for Rome, where the ſentence was revoked, and, at his return to England, he conſecrated ſeven prelates in one day.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding this inſtance of weakneſs, all hiſtorians agree in beſtowing high encomiums upon EDWARD, and in repreſenting him as not much inferior to his father. It is, however, but little which is ſaid of his literary character; though enough to convince us that he was a man of abilities and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Perhaps we may conſider as ſome proof of it, an uſeful and remarkable regulation he made, that if a ſervant was guiſty of theft, the perſon who recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him ſhould be anſwerable for his crime, and reſponſible for his right behaviour. We read alſo, that Edward was particularly careful in the education of his children: that, in conſequence of his attention in this reſpect, they were diſtinguiſhed by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements; and that his daughters were ſo celebrated for their accompliſhments, as to be ſought after, and obtained in marriage, by the greateſt foreign princes, kings, and emperors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0010800101:447"/>But the grand point which intitles him to a place in the hiſtory of letters, is his being generally looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the founder of the univerſity of Cambridge. The fact, however, like other ancient facts, is not ſo clear as to be wholly free from diſpute; while ſome go back to the fabulous ages, for the original of this famous ſeminary; and ſome contend that it had no exiſtence as a ſchool of learning, till the year 1110, in the reign of Henry I. But, without entering into theſe controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, we ſhall only embrace the preſent opportunity of obſerving, that, from ſmall beginnings, Cambridge is become, in a courſe of time, exceedingly illuſtrious, and, in rank, the ſecond univerſity in the world. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to Oxford in magnitude, beauty, the number of colleges, buildings, profeſſors, and ſtudents, it is, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, capable of boaſting many noble edifices and foundations. But though Cambridge muſt yield the palm, in theſe reſpects, to her ſiſter, we ſuppoſe ſhe will be unwilling to do it in the valuable attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſcience and literature. She, as well as Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, hath produced a number of eminent men, ſeveral of whom we ſhall have occaſion to mention in the courſe of our work; not, indeed, as members of a ſingle ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary, but as the ornaments of their country, and the glory of human nature. It has often been ſaid, that Oxford has excelled in the knowledge of the claſſics, belles lettres, and the languages; while Cambridge hath made a ſuperior progreſs in philoſophy, mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics, and the ſeverer ſtudies.

                  <head>ATHELSTAN, A. D. 925.</head>
                  <p>After the death of King Edward, his eldeſt ſon ATHELSTAN was crowned at Kingſton upon Thames, by Athelm, archbiſhop of Canterbury. This ceremony of crowning and anointing the Engliſh Kings by ſome prelate was, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>cording to Malmeſbury, firſt uſed in the reign of King Alfred. Athelſtan ſoon after his coronation began to enter upon action, and ſhewed himſelf ſuch an enterpriſing and ſucceſsful prince, as gave great terror to many of his enemies, and to be eſteemed and careſſed by foreigners, acquired ſome very advantageous alliances, procured honourable matches for his ſiſters; nay exceeded the bounds of the Engliſh limits, for he obliged the Kings of Scotland and Wales to reſign their crowns to him; which he ſoon after, as a prince of generoſity, reſtored to them, upon doing him homage. Thus in civil affairs he gained applauſe; but all the glory of his atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was eclipſed by one act of inhumanity towards his brother Edwin; who being accuſed of diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his Majeſty, he too eaſily gave credit to it, baniſhed his brother, with circumſtances of cruelty highly aggravating, by putting him into a ſhip with only one ſervant, without rigging or crew to ſail the veſſel; and was driven by a ſtorm, which ſoon after befel him, to ſuch great diſtreſs, that he threw himſelf into the ſea. This precipitate act of Athelſtan ſoon after ſtung him with great remorſe, ſo that to ſilence the accuſations of his conſcience, he executed the perſon who informed him againſt his brother, and ſubmitted himſelf to ſeven years penance.</p>
                  <p>But nevertheleſs Athelſtan is confeſſed to have been a very illuſtrious and accompliſhed prince, and is juſtly ranked among the lawgivers of England. His eloquence is, likewiſe, highly extolled by hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who have been pleaſed to aſſert that he was equal, in this reſpect, to the Roman orators. There
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0010800101:449"/>was a regulation made during this reign, that ſhews an enlargement of mind much above the times, and which even more civilized ages have not been able to reach: it was, that a merchant who had effected three voyages to the Streights, on his own account, ſhould be put on a footing with a gentleman. There is one fact related concerning Athelſtan, which, if ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently authentical, would appear of peculiar impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in a ſurvey of literature. We are confidently told by ſeveral modern writers, that he ordered the Bible to be tranſlated out of the Hebrew into the Saxon language, for the benefit of his ſubjects. If this be true, it was a work of the utmoſt uſefulneſs and value, and ſhews the inſtitutions of Alfred to have produced very happy effects. But, notwithſtanding the improvements introduced by that prince, it is much to be queſtioned whether there were any perſons in the kingdom capable of executing ſo grand a deſign; for, in the period we are ſpeaking of, the beſt ſcholars Europe afforded ſeem to have been totally unacquainted with the oriental tongues.</p>
                  <p>There were ſeveral ſynods, or rather mixed conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of church and ſtate held in this prince's reign. Sir Henry Spelman mentions four, but the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable was the ſynod at Graetly, A. D. 928. The principal conſtitutions of which were,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To enjoin the payment of tythes, both perſonal and praedial; and requiring the biſhops and others of the clergy to ſet a good example. The ſecond, for preſcribing acts of charity. The third, regulates ſome proceedings in law, againſt ſacrilege, idolatrous ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, witchcraft, robberies, &amp;c. The fourth and fifth, for aſcertaining the value of coins, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving one fixed ſtandard. The ſixth, prohibits buying and ſelling on Sundays. The ſeventh, preſcribes ſundry penalties againſt perjury, as that the perjured perſon ſhould never more give evidence, nor be buried in conſecrated ground, unleſs ſevere penance be
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0010800101:450"/>performed. By the ſeventh, the ſtandard of weights and meaſures were to be regulated by the biſhops ſtandard; magiſtrates are enjoined to preſerve peace, and to exerciſe lenity and forbearance towards ſervants.</p>
                  <p>By the preamble of theſe conſtitutions it appears that the legiſlature in civil matters lay wholly on the King, and that the biſhops and other great men were convened for their advice, and not to give any force or authority to the laws. But it is a ſad inſtance of the deficiency in their laws, and of the weakneſs of the legiſlature, that the fine for killing men was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their rank; thus that of a duke was valued at 3000 thrimſa's

                  <p>From the days of Athelſtan, down to the conqueſt, the ſtate of knowledge evidently went backward, and the nation ſunk into the depth of ignorance and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. Europe in general, during the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries, was over-run with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and barbarity; and England, if poſſible, was ſtill in a worſe condition. It is really painful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that, in the courſe of ſeveral hundred years, we meet with little worthy to be recorded. Like travellers in the deſerts of Arabia, we often ſee nothing for a long time together, but barren ſands; and if now and then we come to a verdant ſpot, though that ſpot is extremely beautiful, compared with the dreary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect around it, yet it partakes of the ſterility of the ſoil by which it is encompaſſed.</p>
                  <p>The diſputes that agitated the world were of too low and trifling a nature to merit a place in our work. The inſolent and fiery Dunſtan occaſioned much buſtle about the celibacy of the clergy; and how little they were engaged in literary purſuits, appears from a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0010800101:451"/>canon, enjoining every prieſt to learn ſome occupation as a handicraftſman; a regulation which, was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſtood, might be exceedingly proper and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. Another decree preſcribes, that they ſhall be capable of repeating the Creed and the <hi>Pater noſter.</hi> In the reign, however, of Ethelred II. it is ſaid, a miſſion was ſent to Norway, at the requeſt of the King of that country, to convert the Norwegians and the Swedes to the Chriſtian religion. The archbiſhop of York and other divines went over upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and had great ſucceſs, though ſome of them afterwards received the crown of martyrdom. What their real qualifications were, and what influence they had, we are not able to ſay; but may be well aſſured their inſtructions were tinctured with the defects of the times.</p>
                  <p>While ſo much darkneſs prevailed in the kingdom and every thing was gradually giving way to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of the Roman ſee, it ought not to be omitted, that the church of England had not as yet embraced the abſurd and monſtrous doctrine of tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. This is evident from ſeveral teſtimonies, and particularly from the writings of Alfric, who is the ſole perſon that deſerves to be mentioned for more than a century; and who is alſo remarkable for having drawn up a ſet of homilies for the uſe of the clergy, now ſo generally and totally ignorant, as to be utterly incapable of compoſing diſcourſes for the benefit of their people. With reſpect, likewiſe, to the princes who ſucceeded Athelſtan, we meet with nothing but the reduction of the ſeveral Saxon ſtatutes and cuſtoms into one body, by Edward the Confeſſor; and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the ſame monarch, that ſtudious men ſhould be ſecure in their eſtates and properties: an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution which contributed very little to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of literature.</p>

                  <p>Edmund ſucceeded Athelſtan, when he was but eighteen years of age. The Northumbrians, perhaps deſpiſing this prince's youth, broke their articles made with Athelſtan, and notwithſtanding the mediation made uſe of to reconcile the difference, Edmund was obliged to vindicate his right by the ſword, and in the year 944 obtained a compleat victory over the Northumbrians, and ſo far conquered the country as to annex it to his crown; the next year he gave Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland to Malcolm King of the Scots upon the terms of homage, and that he ſhould aſſiſt him in the field, when oceaſion required.</p>
                  <p>The ſame year Dunſtan, who was preferred to the abbey of Glaſtonbury, publiſhed his book of Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, divided into ten chapters, relating to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and diſicipline of the church, as well clergy as laity

                  <p>In the reign of Edmund a great ſynod was convoked at London,
<note>Synod at London, A. D. <hi>944.</hi>
                     </note> in which the biſhops were enjoined to repair their churches, and the King required to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh funds for their ſupport. In the courſe of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing year, another aſſembly enacted conſtitutions for the advancement of the Chriſtian religion, and the maintainance of concord among the people. Here alſo churches and royal palaces were made places of ſanctuary; and it was ordained, that no mulct for breaking the peace, or ſatisfaction for murder, ſhould be accepted. About this period the famous Dunſtan began to ſignalize himſelf in the church and ſtate. He
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0010800101:453"/>was by birth a Weſt-Saxon, deſcended of a noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and educated at Glaſtonbury, under a learned Iriſh monk, who inſtructed youth in that monaſtery. Having made extraordinary progreſs in his ſtudies, he was recommended by Adhelm, archbiſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, to King Athelſtan, who took him under his protection; but no ſooner perceiving his ambitious views, and meddling diſpoſition, than he diſcarded him from his court. It was then that Dunſtan retired in diſguſt from the world, and conceived that affection for the monks which he ſo cordially expreſſed in the whole courſe of his future greatneſs. Edmund, at his acceſſion to the throne, invited him from his retreat, and made him his confeſſor; but he was for ſome miſdemeanor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed from this office, which, however, he regained by dint of intereſt, and acquired amazing influence under this monarch and his brother Edred. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtic life was at the ſame time dignified by an illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous member in the perſon of Turketyl, who was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſoldier and ſound politician, and quitted the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of chancellor to embrace the life of a recluſe, at Croyland, of which he was made abbot, after having received the habit, together with the epiſcopal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and paſtoral ſtaff. He was no ſooner eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the eccleſiaſtical office, than he reſigned the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, with all its deeds, to Edred, who afterwards reſtored them to Turketyl and his monks, in a full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the ſtates at London, whom he exempted from all ſervice and incumbrances, and confirmed all the former privileges of the monaſtery, except that of its being a ſanctuary, which the abbot wiſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.</p>

                  <p>Edred, brother to Edmund, and third ſon to Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Elder, ſucceeded to the crown. This was an interruption to the right line, for the late King left two ſons, Edwy and Edgar; but being both very
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0010800101:454"/>young, they were ſet aſide, and Edred being likewiſe a good benefactor to the monks, the crown was given to him without much oppoſition, and he was crowned by Odo, archbiſhop of Canterbury. Edred is deſcribed as a prince of great courage and enterprize: in the firſt year of his reign he reduced the Northumbrians, who had revolted; his next expedition was againſt the Scots, whom he brought to terms merely by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his arms.</p>
                  <p>With regard to religion, Edred's conſcience was in a manner governed by Dunſtan, inſomuch that he ſubmitted to great auſterities at his direction, and was ſent for as his confeſſor, in his laſt illneſs, to give him abſolution. He died A. D. 955.</p>
                  <p>He is ſaid to be the firſt of all the Saxon monarchs who aſſumed the title of King of Great Britain, a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that favours the opinion of thoſe who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the King of Scotland held his crown as a fief depending upon England.

                  <head>EDWY, A. D. 955.</head>
                  <p>Edwy was elected King by the ſuffrages of the clergy and nobility. This young monarch was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably handſome, that he acquired the ſurname of <hi>Pancalus,</hi> or, the Fair, and at his acceſſion was ſo much in favour with Odo, archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, that he crowned him with his own hands at Kingſton. The King had married a very beautiful lady, named Aelgivia; but the match was ſo contrary to the opinion of the biſhops and nobles, as gave riſe to a ſeries of troubles, and his foundneſs for her
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0010800101:455"/>greatly weakened the authority of the biſhops over him; for after dinner, on the day of his coronation, Edwy withdrew to an apartment where his wife was, which gave great offence to the biſhops and the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the archbiſhop commanded him to be fetched back again, and, though every body elſe refuſed, Dunſtan was ready enough to obey Odo's order, who, reproaching him for his fondneſs, dragged him to his company. Such an outrage could not fail to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the reſentment of the young monarch and the King's friends, who were offended at the overbearing pride of the abbot; and ſoon after Edwy demanded a reſtitution of the ſums which Edred had committed to his charge, and ſtrongly inſinuated that he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzled the public money. Dunſtan haughtily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the money had been app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Odo, the archbiſhop, thinking the dignity of the prieſthood degraded by the exile of Dunſtan, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented a diſaffection: the Mercians and Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians entered into meaſures with the archbiſhop; they rebelled, ſet up Edwy's younger brother Edgar, a boy of thirteen years of age, for their King, who recalled Dunſtan, and immediately ordained him a biſhop, to give him a ſeat in that aſſembly, who made it their buſineſs to gloſs over this oppoſition, or rebellion, with the name of religion, for which many pretended miracles were atteſted to ſupport their unwarrantable proceedings. I mention theſe inſtances, though a digreſſion, to ſhew what exorbitant power and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the biſhops had acquired at that time; ſo that ſome hiſtorians ſpeak of him as having, by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent meaſures, forfeited his crown and his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that if he had been leſs reſolute, he might have ſoothed his enemies.

                  <p>Edwy dying without iſſue, the whole kingdom was reunited under Edgar, who, though in the prime of his youth, had already given undeniable proofs of a ſhining genius, and the moſt ſolid underſtanding. He had manifeſted his ability in making himſelf maſter of a part of his brother's dominions; and he afterwards demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the extenſiveneſs of his capacity, by keeping his ſubjects in ſubmiſſion, and his enemies in fear, without ſtraining the regal authority, or engaging in any mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial enterprize: but he awed his neighbours by taking ſuch meaſures, for the defence of his kingdom, as diſabled them from invading it with any proſpect of ſucceſs. He divided Northumberland into two go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and conſtantly maintained a ſtrong body of forces in the northern provinces, that they might be at hand to quell any inſurrection that ſhould happen among the turbulent people; and in order to ſecure his dominions from the diſcontents of foreign Danes, he equipped a very ſtrong fleet, amounting to two thouſand five hundred veſſels, divided into dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſquadrons, and ſtationed in ſuch a manner that they were continually cruiſing round the iſland, which was thus effectually covered from inſult. Such wiſe precautions could not fail to eſtabliſh peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity among his people, which, in order to fix be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any probability of interruption, he engaged Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett, King of Scotland, in his intereſt, by ceding to him the whole county of Lothian, extending from the Tweed to the Forth, for which, and the northern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties already beſtowed upon Malcolm, that prince cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly did homage. It was, in all probability, owing to this ceſſion and treaty, which ſecured the Scottiſh King as an ally, that Maccuſe, King of Man and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0010800101:457"/>the iſles, ſome monarchs of Galloway, and the Prince of Wales, ſubmitted ſo peaceably to the government of Edgar.</p>
                  <p>The next year Edgar, being at Cheſter, ſummoned all the tributary knights to attend him at that place, who rowed his barge down the river Dee, in his way to the monaſtery of St. John the Baptiſt, while he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſat at the helm. Smollet conſiders this circumſtance as no more than a compliment, or frolic, acted in an excurſion of pleaſure; when it is evident, from the King's behaviour, that it was a real act of homage: nor can his remark, that his ſucceſſors might juſtly boaſt of themſelves to be Kings of England, when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in that manner, be underſtood in any other light.</p>
                  <p>Edgar did not think it ſufficient to protect England from the inſults of foreigners, but he turned his thoughts to ſome regulations that were neceſſary in the ſtate, and then in the church. The firſt was in reſpect to the magiſtrates, of whom there was a general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; and that he might be better effect his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he every year made a viſit to ſome part of his kingdom, to have the beſt accounts he could obtain of the conduct of his judges, &amp;c.; and to remove the abuſes complained of, he enacted, that every magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, convicted of giving a ſentence contrary to law, if through ignorance, ſhould be fined one hundred and twenty ſhillings; but if knowingly, ſhould be turned out, and rendered incapable of acting for the future. We muſt acknowledge this care worthy of a prince, as it was a proper expedient for reſtoring ſuch a regard to juſtice as is the ſecurity of the rights of ſubjects, and the authority of government
<note n="*" place="bottom">Rapin, vol. I. p. 127.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Another wiſe regulation was, the reducing all weights and meaſures to one ſtandard: this he found neceſſary to ſupport the credit of the kingdom in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign markets, in which reſpect he acquired the praiſes
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0010800101:458"/>beſtowed on him by ancient hiſtorians: nay, we may go further; we may boldly ſay, that he ſurpaſſed them, inaſmuch as they obtained their fame by acts of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, and the deſtruction of their ſpecies; whereas Edgar's fame was built upon a noble foundation, that of juſtice and benevolence
<note n="†" place="bottom">Rider, vol. I. p. 22.</note>.</p>
                  <p>But, beſides every inſtance of his great wiſdom in regard to civil affairs, he appears to be piouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: it is ſaid he founded forty monaſteries; that he repaired and embelliſhed a great number, among others that of Glaſton, founded by Edred his uncle. Ingul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, in his hiſtory of Croyland, ſays the treaſure of that monaſtery, in the reign of Edgar, amounted to no leſs than ten thouſand pounds, beſides the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſhrines, and other things. Edgar not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched the monaſteries, but undertook to eſtabliſh the monks a ſecond time in the poſſeſſion of eccleſiaſtical benefices, which he performed with a high hand. This was ſaid to be effected principally at the perſuaſion of Dunſtan, whom Edgar had made archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury; and it is highly probable that Edgar himſelf thought he did a ſignal ſervice to the church by putting it under the direction of monks. Dunſtan, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with him, profeſſed to bring about a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the inferior clergy; for this purpoſe a council was convened, and Edgar himſelf was preſent. At this council, the ſpeech he made plainly ſhews how much he was biaſſed in favour of the monks, and diſcovered his great diſlike of the ſecular clergy, on account of their immoralities. However, as it appears to flow from ſentiments of piety, and is one of the moſt remarkable tranſactions of his reign, though it cannot find place in this hiſtory, we refer the reader to Rapin's hiſtory
<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. I. b. iv. p. 129.</note>.</p>
                  <p>We cannot wholly omit ſome of the principal canons of that convention. They confirm the civil privileges and immunities of the church; preſcribe the religious
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0010800101:459"/>obſervation of the Lord's day; enjoin the clergy to attend conſtantly at their devotion; forbid the prieſts changing their cures. It enjoins every prieſt to learn ſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, to prevent indigence in caſe of misfortune; it ſtrictly requires parents to inſtruct their children in the Chriſtian faith; orders that no perſons be buried in a church, excepting perſons of known probity; forbids the eating of blood: laſtly, the prieſt is to preſs the people, under his cure, to confeſſion, penance, and ſatisfaction; laſtly, to the uſe of oil in baptiſm, and for the anointing of the ſick
<note n="*" place="bottom">Collier's Eccleſ. Hiſt. vol. I. b. xi. p. 187.</note>.</p>
                  <p>After theſe canons there follows a form of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherein are directions for the confeſſarians; and here the prieſts are obliged to a thorough examination of the penitent, and the penance to be proportioned to the nature and degree of the crime, and the condition, temper, age, and capacity of the perſon. And in caſe of infirmity, or weakneſs of conſtitution, the rigour of faſting was to be diſpenſed with. And it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what remarkable, that where the <hi>Pater noſter</hi> is enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſaid threeſcore times a day, there is not the leaſt mention of one <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> which is an argument that the modern applications to the Bleſſed Virgin were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practiſed by the church.</p>

                  <p>Immediately after the deceaſe of Edgar, Elfser, Duke of Mercia, ſworn enemy to the monks, expelled them from all the benefices in his country, which he filled again with ſecular prieſts. Some other noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men followed his example in different parts of the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0010800101:460"/>kingdom; but the Duke of Eaſt-Anglia, and many other perſons of the firſt rank, adhered to Dunſtan and his party, which was likewiſe eſpouſed by almoſt the whole body of the commons, who looked upon that prelate as a ſaint and an apoſtle. This diverſity of ſentiments produced a conteſt concerning the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. Elfrida, their queen-dowager, a woman of an ambitious ſpirit, had, by her emiſſaries, circulated ſome doubts about the validity of Edgar's marriage with the mother of Edward, in hopes of raiſing her own ſon, Ethelred, to the throne; and as the other was ſupported by Dunſtan, all that prelate's enemies declared for the ſon of Elfrida. Though by theſe means there was a very powerful faction formed in his favour, the archbiſhop, confiding in his great popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, aroſe from the aſſembly of the ſtates, while they were deliberating upon the choice of a ſucceſſor to Edgar, and taking prince Edward by the hand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to the church, where he was anointed and conſecrated, in the twelfth year of his age, amidſt a vaſt concourſe of people, who teſtified their joy in loud acclamations.</p>
                  <p>Whatever inclinations the oppoſite party felt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert this irregular way of proceeding, they would not run the riſk of diſobliging the multitude, but left Edward in quiet poſſeſſion of the throne; while his ſtepmother, Elfrida, retired to Corf-Caſtle, in Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire, which was aſſigned her dowry, and there in ſecret hatched ſchemes for his deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Dunſtan having thus ſecured the continuance of his own power, exerted all his endeavours to maintain the monks in the benefices they had acquired in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding reign, which he endeavoured to ſupport by pretended miracles.</p>
                  <p>Edward however called a ſynod at Ameſbury, in Wiltſhire, in which ſeveral canons were made with a deſign to bring the province to a nearer conformity with the Roman church. Beſides theſe eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0010800101:461"/>affairs, no tranſaction of conſequence diſtinguiſhed the reign of Edward, which laſted but four years, and was concluded in a very tragical manner. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning one day from the chace in Dorſetſhire, rode up to the gate of Corf-Caſtle, to pay a compliment to his ſtep-mother Elfrida, who invited him to alight; but being in a hurry to be gone, ſhe prevailed with him to drink a glaſs of wine on horſeback, and while he was ſwallowing the liquor was ſtabbed in the back by one of her domeſtics.</p>

The Danes took advantage of it to renew their depredations on the kingdom, and Ethelred ſeeing his realm reduced to a miſerable ſituation, obeyed the dectates of his fears and deſpondence, and ſubmitted to pay thirty thouſand pounds to thoſe invaders; upon which many of the Danes retired to their own country.

After the Dane had taken an oath, that he would govern them faithfully in matters, both ſecular and religious, after many conteſts and ſtruggles for the crown, Edmund was induced to open a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference on the ſubject of peace, in order to prevent any farther effuſion of blood. This propoſal being eagerly embraced by both parties, a treaty was concluded, in which this kingdom was divided between the two competitors; all the country to the ſouth of the Thames and part of Weſſex was aſſigned to Edmund, and all the reſt of the iſland ceded to Canute. After the ratification of the treaty, by the perfidy of Edric, or ſome other perſon, in which hiſtorians are not agreed, Edmund was aſſaſſinated before he had opportunity to diſplay his virtues. However; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been a perſon of ſtrict juſtice, great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, ſublime generoſity, intrepid courage, and invincible patience; though theſe virtues were obſcured by the weakneſs he ſhewed in admitting Edric into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, notwithſtanding he had been the ruin of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his treachery.</p>

                  <p>As ſoon as Canute heard of the murder of Edmund, he convened a general council of all the nobility and clergy at London, in order to ſecure the ſucceſſion of the whole kingdom. When the aſſembly was met, he artfully availed himſelf of the laſt treaty he had made with the late King, and it was not without much difficulty he preſerved his kingly authority. We ſhall not enter upon the civil part of his hiſtory and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; it is acknowledged by ſome hiſtorians, that no King ever deſerved a more contradictory character, nor that any adminiſtration produced a greater variety of conduct: he diſcovered an ambition that regarded nothing but the accompliſhments of his wiſhes: even the acts of ſuperſtition, which he performed to atone for his former cruelties, may be ſuſpected to be incited by policy, and tinctured with ambition. The gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of his expedition to Rome, and the large ſums he expended there, may be charged with oſtentation, if not with profuſion. Yet, with all his faults, it muſt be confeſſed he was poſſeſſed of great virtues, and was certainly a perſon of great abilities. He ſeemed to have been well acquainted with mankind, and able to turn the various diſpoſitions of his ſubjects to his advantage. Scarce any monarch ever raiſed popular odium ſo high, or allayed it ſo effectually as Canute; but in the latter part of his reign he paid a much greater regard to the intereſt and to the eſteem of his ſubjects. The variety of his victories did not ſo entitle him to the epithet of Great, as the virtues which he practiſed during the peaceable interval of his adminiſtration. It was in that period that he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted his piety, his charity, and his equity: his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence was great, his addreſs engaging, his affability remarkable, his mercy extenſive: his love of peace manifeſted itſelf in his encouragement of thoſe who
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0010800101:464"/>were of a pacific diſpoſition, and his ſtrict regard to juſtice in his ſeverity to thoſe who were guilty of any acts of robbery or violence. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>der concern he had for the welfare and proſperity of the meaneſt of his ſubjects, is evident from many of his letters to his officers; and, during the calm of peace, he applied his thoughts to the ſublime ſtudy of legiſlation, and, by the number of his laws, ſeemed to have made it his ſtudy to leave no grievance without redreſs. For the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice, he ordered that no diſtinction ſhould be made between rich and poor, and recommends mercy in all deciſions; that no perſon ſhould be put to death for a ſmall offence; and in caſe any judge perverted judgment out of prejudice, or for the ſake of lucre, he was to be fined the value of his head

Perſons guilty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt the King were puniſhed with loſs of life; and the demoliſhing or burning houſes, theft, and murder, were declared to be ſuch offences for which no ſatisfaction could be made by way of mulct and compenſation. The regulations he preſcribed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to married perſons, were highly conducive to make that ſtate reſpectable, and to prevent incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence.</p>
                  <p>The eccleſiaſtical laws, enacted by this monarch, are not leſs curious than the civil, and ſhew that he extended his concern, not only to the ſecular, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the ſpiritual welfare of his kingdom; and with this view he enacted, that no fairs, markets, or other ſecular affairs, ſhould be practiſed on the Lord's day. All Chriſtians were obliged to receive the euchariſt, or the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper, three times a year. And in order to oblige his clergy to live ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their character, and to ſhew they were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted by their order from the civil juriſdiction, he enacted, that if a prieſt was guilty of murder, or

                  <head>EDWARD <hi>the</hi> Confeſſor, A. D. 1042.</head>
                  <p>The Engliſh had ſuffered ſo much from the Danes, during the reign of ſome late kings, that there was a general inſurrection, and they intended to drive all the Danes out of the kingdom; but at length a council was held at Gillingham for the election of a king; and Earl Godwin, a perſon of great influence, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering his promiſe to Edward, took him along with him incog. to the meeting. After a long harrangue which the Earl made in favour of the prince, he raiſed him in the midſt of the aſſembly, ſaying at the ſame time, "Behold your King." The aſſembly being ſtaggered at ſo unexpected an event, after a ſhort pauſe, they agreed to elect Edward for their ſovereign; and, to give ſanction to their choice, Earl Godwin was the firſt who did him homage.</p>
                  <p>Edward, being thus ſettled upon his throne, could not help ſhewing the fondneſs he had contracted for the Norman cuſtoms; during his exile he invited over ſeveral of that nation, and behaved towards theſe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners with a partiality that gave great diſguſt to the Engliſh nobility: he even carried his regard to ſuch a height as was both impolitic and unjuſt; the moſt important fortreſſes, and the greateſt poſts in the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0010800101:467"/>kingdom, were conferred on the Normans; and the ſee of Canterbury being vacant, it was filled by one Rodbert a monk; he ſoon poſſeſſed Edward with a high opinion of his capacity and integrity, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed his confidence. Godwin finding the ear of the King poſſeſſed by a foreigner, was apprehenſive that his maſter might be led to ſuch meaſures as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the good of the kingdom; he therefore endeavoured, but in vain, to remove the prelate from the place he held in the King's eſteem; but the King was not a little exaſperated at the conduct of Godwin. The Iriſh taking advantage of the unſettled ſtate of the nation, meditated a deſcent, which was attended with ſome dreadful conſequences. At length a council was convened, and Godwin and his ſons, who had fled to Ireland, and promoted the animoſity of the Iriſh, were nevertheleſs acquitted of every crime laid to their charge, reinſtated in their honours and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and reſtored to the King's favour. Many other quarrels and conteſts took place in this King's reign, which being foreign to my deſign I ſhall omit. The King at length, worn out with years, and unable to perform the vow which he had made of going a pilgrimage to Rome, obtained the Pope's diſpenſation, on condition of his building the abbey of Weſtminſter. This noble ſtructure, which ſtill goes by the ſame name, was originally the temple of Apollo, and was by King Sebert turned into a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church; during the devaſtations of the Danes, it was deſtroyed and laid in ruins, till Edward rebuilt it, for the reaſon already aſſigned. A general council of the nation was called to confirm the King's charter, who exempted it from all epiſcopal juriſdiction, and granted it the privilege of a ſanctuary. The dedication of this ſacred edifice engroſſed all Edward's thoughts, and the officiouſneſs he ſhewed on that occaſion very probably threw him into the fever, which was the occaſion of his death. The monks gave him the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0010800101:468"/>glorious titles of Saint and Confeſſor; but it would have been with much better grace, if his public or private virtues had ever been ſo conſpicuous as to deſerve them. The tranquillity of his reign was certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, if we conſider the factions which ſubſiſted among his nobles; ſome have repreſented him as void of all paſſion, and attribute much to that evenneſs and ſerenity of temper; but they ſhould rather have ſaid he was void of all the ſocial affections; his treatment of his wife and mother would juſtify ſuch a charge, nay they even extort it. His chaſtity, which the monks have applauded ſo highly as to found his merits of being canonized thereupon, was it not owing to natural frigidity, is ſuch a violation of the marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow as ought to tranſmit eternal infamy on his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<note n="*" place="bottom">Voltaire obſerves on this occaſion, that one of the great faults, or great misfortunes of this King, was his having no children by his wife, daughter to one of the moſt powerful noblemen of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: he hated his wife as well as his own mother, and for reaſons of ſtate had them both removed from court. However the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the marriage-bed proved the occaſion of his canonization, for it was pretended that he had made a vow of chaſtity; a raſh vow ſurely, for a married man, and highly abſurd for a King, who ſtood in need of an heir to his dominions; but by this vow, real or pretended, he forged new chains for his country." See Smol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let's elegant tranſlation of Voltaire, vol. I. p. 268.</note>. Though honoured with the title of ſaint, and ranked by the flattery of ſuperſtition among the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, his irraſcibility and inexorable reſentment were ſhewn ſo flagrantly in the affair of Euſtace, and in his antipathy to Godwin's family, that it would be a ſtretch of equity to deem him inculpable. The nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous miracles he is ſaid to perform, deſerve to be ranked among the legendary accounts of papal heroes; nor do the pretended cures of the ſcrophulous humour, called the <hi>King's evil,</hi> by touching, which this King pretended to, in imitation of thoſe of France, deſerve more credit.</p>

All cauſes in which the church was concerned were to have the preference to any others, and every perſon who was a tenant to the church was obliged to bring his action in the eccleſiaſtical court. The clergy were likewiſe exempted from the civil juriſdiction; the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of ſanctuaries were confirmed, and no fugitive was allowed to be taken from thence, unleſs by the biſhop and his officers: every offence againſt the peace of the church was left to the cognization of the biſhop of the dioceſe in which it was committed, and the offender was obliged to give ſecurity, that he would make ſatisfaction to God, the King, and the church, within forty days, and in caſe he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded was to be outlawed; the payment of Rome Scot, and of ſmall tithe, he ſtrictly enjoined, and if refuſed, it was levied by the King's juſtice, becauſe it was the King's alms

If any one was murdered, inqueſt was to be made after the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, in the village or town where the body was found; in caſe the murderer was diſcovered, he was to be delivered up to juſtice; in caſe he could not be immediately found, a month and a day was allowed for that purpoſe; and in caſe he was not found by that time, the town was obliged to pay forty-ſix marks, and if unable to pay that ſum, the fine was to be levied on the hundred, and the money was to be kept ſealed up for one year; and in caſe the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0010800101:470"/>was not diſcovered, ſix marks were to be paid to the relations of the deceaſed, and the other forty were to go to the King. Thoſe ſtatutes which more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concern the office and prerogative of the King, are compiled with great judgment. In deſcribing the office of a King, the ſtatute informs us he is the vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent of the ſupreme King, and is appointed to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and defend this earthly kingdom, and the people of the Lord, and above all things ſhould reverence his holy church, and diſcourage all evil doers, which unleſs he do, he forfeits his title and dignity. The King had a prerogative to pardon life and loſs of member, on condition that the malefactor made the beſt ſatisfaction he could to the perſons injured. Every act of extortion and oppreſſion ſeemed peculiarly to demand this monarch's notice; he remitted the tax of Danegelt, and could not endure the collecting of taxations by exciſemen; nor were uſurers tolerated at that time in England.</p>
                  <p>This is a ſummary of the laws which Edward' the Confeſſor collected from thoſe which had been enacted by former Kings, and afterwards enforced by William the Conqueror, of which we ſhall treat in its proper place.</p>

                     </gap>ing in this requeſt, the King turning his face to the wall, replied, "When
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0010800101:471"/>I am dead, let the Engliſh make either the Duke or the Earl King
<note n="*" place="bottom">This author wrote in the time of Edward I. his hiſtory is now in manuſcript in the Cottonian collection, marked Cleopatra, A12, cited by Ryder.</note>."</p>
                  <p>Harold however uſed his intereſt with ſuch dexterity, as to get himſelf crowned, and began his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with many popular acts of government; he paid great deference to the clergy, without ſhutting his eyes to the irregularities of that order, ſeverely chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the guilty, while he beſtowed marks of his favour upon the innocent, by confirming their charters and extending their immunities; he took the moſt effectual meaſures for the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice, ordered the laws to be revived and reformed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amplary puniſhments to be inflicted on robbers and diſturbers of the public peace; and being alarmed with the news of the pretenſions of William Duke of Normandy to the crown, he fortified ſome of his territories and ports.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of Normandy, though well informed of all theſe popular tranſactions of Harold, would not deſiſt from his enterprize; and even ſent ambaſſadors to demand that Harold would relinquiſh the crown in his favour, and to denounce war in caſe of refuſal. To this peremptory demand Harold replied, that William had no ſort of right to the crown of England; for, granting that the late King had diſpoſed of it in his favour, ſuch a diſpoſition (if any ſuch there was) could not take place, inaſmuch as it was diametrically oppoſite to the laws of the kingdom; which reſtricted Kings from beſtowing their crowns according to their own caprice, eſpecially to ſtrangers. With reſpect to himſelf, he had been fairly elected by thoſe who had a right to confer the ſovereignty; nor could he yield the crown to any other, without betraying the confidence repoſed in him by his ſubjects; finally, he gave him to underſtand, that he knew how to defend his right
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0010800101:472"/>againſt any perſon by whom he ſhould be invaded: an anſwer, that referred the diſpute to the determination of war; for which both parties prepared with the utmoſt diligence.</p>
                  <p>William the Norman accordingly embarked at St. Valery towards the latter end of September, and after a ſhort paſſage landed at Pevenſey in Suſſex; after having refreſhed his men, he advanced along the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to Haſtings, where he ordered a fort to be built, and publiſhed a manifeſto. But though he pretended that he came to revenge the death of Alfred, reſtore the archbiſhop of Canterbury, aſſiſt the Engliſh in puniſhing Harold, who had ſeized the crown without having any right to it (but made no mention of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward's will) theſe reaſons appeared ſo triſling, that no Engliſhman would inliſt under his banner; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he forbad his people to ravage the country, or inſult the inhabitants, whom he was pleaſed to term his ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>Harold was at York when he received the news of this invaſion, and forthwith began his march to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don with the troops that had returned from the north; and whilſt he was in London, waiting for ſome troops that were on their march to join him, and receiving the profeſſions of the nobility in his favour, William ſent ambaſſadors to him with another threatening meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which Harold retorted by another embaſſy of the ſame nature. Some propoſals were made for the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle being conducted by his brother Gurth. But Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold bravely replied in the negative, and that he would by his perſonal behaviour convince his ſubjects he was worthy of the crown they had ſet upon his head.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh monarch having aſſembled all his forces, advanced againſt the Norman army, and encamped within ſeven miles of Haſtings, where they remained at ſome little diſtance from each other; and the Duke made ſome overtures, by one of his monks, to refer the diſpute to the determination of the Pope, to quit the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0010800101:473"/>kingdom, if he would do him homage for the crown, or decide it by a ſingle combat. To theſe propoſitions Harold replied, that he was not ſo ſimple as to ſubmit to the arbitration of the Pope, who had already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf a party; that he ſcorned to hold the crown of England dependent on any prince whatſoever, nor would he put his kingdom on the iſſue of a ſingle combat, in which, though he ſhould obtain the victory, he could reap no ſolid advantage; he therefore told the meſſenger, God would next day decide between him and his adverſary.</p>
                  <p>The fatal day being come, the fourteenth of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, both armies appeared in array, each of them conſiſting of about ſixty thouſand, both commanded by men of intrepid valour; and ſeveral ſkirmiſhes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that day, without any remarkable advantage gained on either ſide. William perceiving the night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and unwilling to leave the battle undecided, made another deſperate effort to diſlodge the enemy; and in this attack Harold was ſhot dead with an arrow that pierced his brain.</p>
                  <p>Thus fell the brave, but unfortunate prince Harold II. with his ſword drawn in defence of Engliſh liberty, and was with his brother Gurth and Lewin ſent to their mother Githa, and were honourably interred in the abbey at Waltham, which Harold himſelf had founded.</p>
                  <p>Some hiſtorians have endeavoured to blacken Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold's character, particularly for ſuperſeding prince Edgar, who had the greateſt right to the throne. The impartial will, perhaps, acknowledge Harold would have been more worthy of the crown, had he been leſs anxious to obtain it; for while he was a private man, he won the love and eſteem of his fellow-ſubjects: nor could any action of his reign, which was not a year, forfeit that eſteem and affection, eſpecially as he had ſhewn a regard to the Britiſh liberties and intereſt by two battles, which he fought in a ſhort ſpace. By one
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0010800101:474"/>of them he obtained a ſignal victory over the Norwegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the unhappy iſſue of the laſt was never attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to his want of courage or conduct. In fine, he was as far, perhaps as the nature and perplexity of his affairs permitted, well diſpoſed with reſpect to religion, always liberal to the church, and the friend of the clergy: but in the ſocial and relative virtues few exceeded him; he was humane, mild, affable, and generous, ſuch as made his character amiable, as a huſband, a parent, and a friend.</p>

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0010800101:475"/>corner of the iſland, where they continued till the year 1212, before they were incorporated with England.</p>
                  <p>The Saxon form of government was rather ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical than monarchical; and they were diſtinguiſhed into the three ranks of noblemen, freemen, and ſlaves. Hengiſt eſtabliſhed the kingdom of Kent in 455; and the heptarchy, after ſome confuſion, was formed in 582. Theſe ſeven kingdoms were conſidered as one grand ſtate or confederacy; and the command of their armies was given to one prince, choſen out of the reſt, on whom ſome hiſtorians have peculiarly beſtowed the title of monarch, as having the precedence and ſome ſuperiority over the others. The Saxon revolution was entire, as far as it extended: they introduced their language with their government; and theſe together with their cuſtoms have deſcended to their poſterity, increaſed by other engraftments on the original ſtock. Their <hi>Wittenagemot</hi> was like our parliament, of which it is the ſource, where they deliberated upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affairs of the ſeven kingdoms; and every king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was ſubject to the reſolutions of the general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. But it is hard to trace how regularly they moved as to civil affairs, how cloſely they followed their country-cuſtoms, or where they innovated or varied from their German forms and policy. Some footſteps are however diſcoverable, which have remained to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; as the diviſions of the country into hundreds; the appointing of ſheriffs, and electing annual magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates by the people; as alſo the juriſdiction and power of life and death by juries. The whole fabric of this government was ſolid and magnificent, equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the honour of the prince, and the ſecurity of the ſubjects: but it is in England only that this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient generous manly government of Europe ſurvives, and continues in its original perfection.</p>
                  <p>After the formation of the heptarchy, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of the different kingdoms, each in their turn, aſpired at the government of the whole, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0010800101:476"/>ſeveral wars among the Saxons, who freely ſhed their bloods, but carefully preſerved their liberties. It is remarkable, that the Saxons who ſettled in Britain acknowledged an hereditary right in the female line; while thoſe who ſettled in France, aboliſhed it there by the Salique law: but Pharamond ſubdued Gaul by conqueſt, and Hengiſt planted himſelf in Britain by policy.</p>
                  <p>The kingdom of the Weſt Saxons was the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable among the heptarchy, and was founded by Cerdic in 495. Sexburgha, an excellent princeſs, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned this kingdom in 672; and Ina began his reign in 690, who publiſhed a body of laws, intitled, <hi>Weſt Saxon Lege,</hi> or the laws of Weſt Saxons, whereby he diſtinguiſhed himſelf as the firſt Saxon prince, who regularly ſummoned a great council or parliament, to enact laws for the better government of his kingdom; for none of their Kings had the power of making laws, without the conſent of the general aſſembly of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, compoſed of the chief nobility. It then conſiſted of nine articles, and ſerved for the foundation of the laws publiſhed in the next century by Alfred. His ſucceſſor, Sigebert, ſhewed himſelf a tyrant; and he was dethroned by his ſubjects, who were a free people; while the Saxon heptarchy was ſoon after diſſolved, and the Engliſh monarchy founded by Egbert.</p>
                  <p>The great Egbert was of the blood royal of the line of Cerdic; but the crown was granted to him by the election of the people, who, in the language of the beſt hiſtorian, William of Malmeſbury, commanded him to reign in the year 800. He found the Saxon ſtrength was degenerated, and their common liberty endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the potency of Charlemagne, who had cauſed himſelf to be crowned Emperor of the Weſt. But in 829, Egbert became the ſole monarch of all the hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchy, and was crowned King of Britain by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

                  <p>About this time the Danes and Normans became terrible to England and France; nor were their depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations abated, till they made ſettlements in both countries: indeed they were another ſwarm of the old northern hive, and were only a remoter branch of the Saxons. The Danes were formidable at ſea, and the naval glory of the Saxons had ſubſided; but Alfred revived it in 882, and Edgar compleated it in 959; which for many years preſerved the liberty of England. Alfred was juſtly called the father of the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; but he could not prevent the Danes from ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling in his dominions, while he was forming the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of thoſe laws which have preſerved the glory of England, and the liberties of Engliſhmen; beſides, he founded, or at leaſt greatly augmented, the univerſity of Oxford, and the ſciences flouriſhed under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
                  <p>The ſucceſſors of Alfred bravely oppoſed the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Danes till the reign of Ethelred II. who gave his enemies an opportunity of rendering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more formidable than ever; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bravery of his ſucceſſor Edmund Ironſide, the Danes ſucceeded in their attempts; for on his death Canute became the firſt. Daniſh King of England in 1016.</p>
                  <p>The Daniſh conqueror governed England like a Saxon monarch: the Danes, in a courſe of two hundred years, had intermarried with the Engliſh families, and were ſo much incorporated as to become one people. The Saxon laws were confirmed, and the Danes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them. But the two ſucceeding monarchs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0010800101:478"/>like tyrants, which renewed the Engliſh ſpirit, and recovered the liberty of England; for the Saxon line was reſtored in 1041, in the perſon of Edward the Confeſſor, who reduced the Weſt Saxon, Mercian and Daniſh laws into one body, which are ſtill in force as the common law of the land.</p>
                  <p>Harold II. was an uſurper, but was deprived both of his crown and life by an invader. This was Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the Conqueror, who defeated Harold in 1066, and aſcended the throne which he claimed by the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Edward the Confeſſor, without any mention of conqueſt, as he was conſcious that the Engliſh were tenacious of their liberty.</p>
                  <p>The Normans very probably had the ſame original with the Danes, and eſtabliſhed themſelves under Rollo, in 876, in that part of France to which he gave the name of Normandy. A potent kingdom was now enſlaved by a ſmall dukedom; for, after the battle of Haſtings, the Engliſh thought no more of ſtriving for their liberties, becauſe the Conqueror ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the crown on the pretence of election, inſtead of aſſerting his right by conqueſt; he ſwore to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ancient laws of the kingdom, promiſed to protect the liberties of the people; but he ſoon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to make England a land of ſlavery, while the Engliſh poſſeſſions became the property of Normans, and a new race of people ſpread themſelves over the nations. William introduced the feodal law, and ſome Norman cuſtoms, which he engrafted on thoſe of the Saxons. The introduction of military tenures was a violent blow upon Engliſh liberty, and all public acts were made in the Norman tongue; ſo that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſeemed as if ſhe was going to be deprived of every thing precious and valuable. But the union of the Norman and Saxon lines under Henry I. promiſed better days to England; for this prince, in 1100, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his coronation-oath by his charter, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the royal authority within its ancient bounds, and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0010800101:479"/>guarded the ſubjects from arbitrary power; beſides, he married the Princeſs Matilda, the niece of Edgar Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who was the immediate heir of the line of Cerdic, whereby the Saxons and Normans conſidered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only as one united body of Engliſhmen.</p>
                  <p>The conqueſt is indeed a great epocha in the civil hiſtory of our country, but none at all in the hiſtory of literature, the ſame darkneſs continued in the nation, and ſeems for a time to have rather increaſed. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the Conqueror was wholly employed in eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his authority in his newly acquired dominions, with which view he endeavoured to aboliſh the Engliſh laws, and changed the methods of proceeding in the courts of judicature. He was alſo extremely ſolicitous to bring in the general uſe of the Norman, upon the ruins of the Saxon tongue; this however he could not effect; the conſequences of which attempt was, that both languages degenerated from their orginal ſtate, and became in ſome meaſure mixed with each other.</p>
                  <p>The Saxon <hi>Wettenagemot</hi> was turned into the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man parliament, and arbitrary power was bound by legal right. Stephen was elected King, on condition of reſtoring the kingdom to its liberties, aboliſhing the foreſt laws, and receiving thoſe of Edward the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor; but the ambition of the clergy, and the power of the barons, were too great for the prerogative of the King, and England became a prey to the fury of civil wars. When King John obtained the crown, he was informed by Hubert, archbiſhop of Canterbury, "That he aſcended the throne by election, and not by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary ſucceſſion; to the end that he might always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that thoſe who gave him the crown, had likewiſe the power to take it away." All the Kings from William the Conqueror ſwore to the ſtrict obſervance of the laws, though that oath was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by none. John wanted to render himſelf ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute; and his people wanted as much to preſerve their liberty: he levied ſeveral oppreſſive taxes; the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0010800101:480"/>Pope abſolved his ſubjects from their oath of allegiance, and the King paid a ſhameful ſubmiſſion to the papal nuncio; the barons entered into a confederacy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the conſtitution, and formally demanded the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of the laws of Edward the Confeſſor, with the removal of the charter of Henry I. The King ſwore he would never grant his ſubjects ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, as would make himſelf a ſlave; but the barons took to their arms, and compelled the monarch to meet them in Runemead, or the mead of Council, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Staines and Windſor; where, on the fifth of June 1215, they obtained the ſacred charter of their liberties called Magna Charta, as alſo the charter of the liberties of the foreſt.</p>
                  <p>The charters are the foundation of the Engliſh liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the bulwark of the Britiſh conſtitution. Some princes have imprudently attempted to break this ſacred barrier; but they found the ſpirit of the people above ſuch an innovation, and they ſuffered for their temerity. However, the bill of rights, made in conſequence of the revolution, is declaratory of thoſe liberties to which Engliſhmen are entitled, and which God grant may never be violated.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the ſtate of religion juſt before the conqueſt; although at this time many corruptions had crept into the church, and divine worſhip began to be clogged with ſuperſtitious ceremonies; yet it appears that the Britiſh church, in ſome material points, had not conformed to the errors of the Romiſh ſee.</p>
                  <p>For, firſt, both clergy and laity were required to exerciſe themſelves in reading the ſacred ſcriptures, ſinging pſalms, &amp;c. The biſhops and teachers were recommended to the ſtudy of the Old Teſtament, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the original Hebrew, and the New accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the oriental Greek. And though we find prayers for the dead, yet they were not in the nature of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for their ſins, or to procure relaxation from their torments, but were only an honourable comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration

<note n="*" place="bottom">Fuller's Church Hiſtory, who cites Bede Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib. 3. cap. 5. Hiſtory of the Church of Great Britain, p. 37.</note>." And Bede likewiſe relates, that the communion was received under both kinds. Cuthbert himſelf, a little before his deceaſe, received the communion of the Lord's body and blood; and though the word maſs was frequent in this age, yet it was not known to be offered as a propitiatory ſacrifice for the quick and the dead.</p>
                  <p>There were nevertheleſs ſuch a prevalence of many of the Popiſh principles and ceremonies, that the more ſerious and diſcerning among the Engliſh began to be greatly alarmed, eſpecially as it was become a cuſtom at this time in the Roman Catholic countries to impoſe the belief of the Catholic faith, and a conformity to their ceremonies, under the ſanction of penal laws or eccleſiaſtical cenſure.</p>
                  <p>Some who were zealous for a reformation in France about this time, expoſed themſelves to great difficulty and hazard.

That province, and many of his adherents, were obliged to deſiſt from public worſhip, according to what they thought their duty; but as yet any other attempts to a reformation were unſucceſsful, through the overgrown power of the Romiſh church. See Dupin, Cent. XI.</p>

                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:0010800101:484"/>About this time the antient ſect of the Albigenſes, or Waldenſes, were animated with freſh vigour, to ſtand up for the truth. Theſe owe their rights to Peter Waldens, in the province of Languedoc, in the time of Pope Sylveſter, in the fourth century. Their diſcriminating tenets were, the belief of one God, or of the unity of God; baptiſm of adult believers, by dipping, faſting and abſtinence, as thoſe of Aſiatics, mentioned by Origen

               <div type="part">
                  <head>WILLIAM, <hi>ſurnamed the</hi> Conqueror, A. D. 1066.</head>
                  <p>IF we impartially conſider the Duke of Normandy's attempt upon England, we ſhall find it difficult to determine, whether the ground of his pretenſions, the boldneſs of his undertaking, or the ſucceſs attending it, is moſt ſurpriſing: the conſequence was a dreadful anarchy of perplexity and conſternation, from different motives of intereſt, terror, and deſpair, which this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction occaſioned in London. The Conqueror con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the loſs of a battle might aſtoniſh, but not terrify the Engliſh; that they might have conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of men and arms, before he could be much rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced from Normandy. However, he concluded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his march for London, in three diviſions; ordering his men, if attacked, to deſtroy the country with fire and ſword. As he approached the capital in this manner, the terrors of the people waxed ſtronger and ſtronger, and the clergy uſed all their induſtry and inſinuation to diſſuade them from making reſiſtance. But, in oppoſition to theſe perſuaſions, Morcar and Edwin, the two brothers of Harold, took an opportunity to ſally out with their party from London, thinking to find him unprepared: but they were ſo warmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they retired with great precipitation; and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0010800101:490"/>even this attempt was attended with no ſmall diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, for it occaſioned his ſetting fire to ſome parts of the ſuburbs of London; ſo that at this time the nobles and prelates aſſembled at London, would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger delay to ſeize the only opportunity they might have, to plead the merit of a voluntary ſubmiſſion. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly went forth, attended by the magiſtrates of London, and meeting the Duke at the head of his troops, made a ſolemn tender of the crown: he received them with great courteſy, and, after having taken time to deliberate upon the propoſal, accepted the offer they had made, and aſſured them they would have no cauſe to repent of their choice

                  <p>The Norman having thus acknowledged the power of election in the people of England, in deigning to receive the crown as a preſent, was immediately proclaimed King, and appointed the day for his coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at London; and purſuant to his own deſire the ceremony was performed by Aldred archbiſhop of York; who upon that occaſion addreſſed himſelf to the Engliſh, aſſembled in great numbers, aſked if they choſe William Duke of Normandy for their King? and was anſwered in the affirmative, with loud acclamations. The biſhop of Conſtance having put the ſame queſtion to the Normans, and received the like reply, Aldred ſet the crown on his head; and then the Norman took the accuſtomed oath, importing that he would protect the church and its miniſters, govern his people with equity, enact juſt laws, and cauſe them to be punctually obſerved
<note n="†" place="bottom">Malmeſbury.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The firſt act of ſovereignty he exerciſed after his coronation, was the ſeizure of Harold's treaſure, which he found amaſſed at Wincheſter, part of which he diſtributed among the principal officers of his army, part was given to churches and monaſteries; and a large ſhare ſent to the Pope, as a mark of his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0010800101:491"/>for the countenance of that pontiff, to whom he in great meaſure owed the ſucceſs of his late enterprize.</p>
                  <p>He granted a new charter to the city of London, confirming the privileges which the citizens enjoyed in the reign of Edward the Confeſſor. He preſerved the Saxon laws and conſtitution, and put the laws in force againſt robbers, who then infeſted the country; and in order to add to the ſafety of his kingdom, he built two caſtles, one at Cheſter, and the other at Stafford, which he ſtrengthened with garriſons.</p>
                  <p>The firſt act of his arbitrary power was manifeſted, in renewing the odious tax of <hi>danegelt,</hi> a quit-rent out of all the lands of England, wardſhips, reliefs, fines, &amp;c.
<note n="*" place="bottom">This was one ſhilling on every hide of land, that is, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred acres; but every manurer of land paid if he had but a tenth part. Rapin, vol. I. b. v. p. 141.</note>. This occaſioned a general diſcontent through the kingdom, and made ſome inſurrections, which William very ſeverely puniſhed. After all the ſources of rebellion were quaſhed, William endeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the laws, cuſtoms, and language of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; loading his countrymen with benefits, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the nobles and barons of this realm. Nor was his oppreſſions confined to the nobility, but extended alſo to the clergy, whoſe charters he violated without ſcruple; ordained that the church-lands ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to military ſervice, and furniſh a certain number of horſemen: beſides, he lodged great part of his army in monaſteries. Where he could get any information of any riches hid or depoſited in them, he ordered them to be ſearched, and ſeized upon every thing that was valuable. He likewiſe depoſed Stigand, archbiſhop of Canterbury, and ſeveral other prelates, and promoted to their dignity ſtrangers from different climes, and ſome of his Norman chaplains, and ſeized on many of the abbey-lands. By theſe means he ſtrengthened his intereſt, increaſed his revenues, and made himſelf the terror of the country, where they were too weak to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0010800101:492"/>Many of the Engliſh nobility fled to Scotland. This ſo exaſperated William, that he picked a quarrel with Malcolm King of Scotland, A. D. 1072, who was too well prepared to be immediately intimidated; both parties prepared for war, and both armies ready for action, but not eager to begin the attack. William found them well entrenched, and knew Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm had been trained to arms, ſo that both parties inclined to an accommodation; and on Malcolm's ſending an embaſſy to William, a peace was made on the following terms: "That the boundaries of the two nations ſhould be ſettled; that he ſhould ſwear fealty to him, or do him homage; and that William ſhould reſtore the Engliſh exiles to their eſtates.</p>
                  <p>After William had made things a little eaſy at home, he retired to Normandy, when a conſiderable revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happened in the church. At the death of Allexander there was no ſmall diſſention in the conclave, which flamed ſo high, that two Popes were elected, viz. Hildebrand and Guibert, who were each of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by different powers. However, the former, named Gregory VII. was recognized by the Kings of France and England; but Hildebrand was no ſooner ſettled in the chair, than he diſcovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a perſon of inordinate ambition and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inſolence: determined to make William pay for the countenance and favour he had ſhewn him while he was cardinal, ſoon after his return to England, he ſent one of his nuncios to him with letters, wherein he inſiſted on his doing homage to him for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of England, as a fief of the Roman ſee, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the arrears of Rome Scot, which had not been paid for ſome years.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer which William made to this inſolent demand, was worthy of the King of England. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do fealty to the Pope, and ſtrengthened his refuſal, by appealing to the conduct of his anceſtors,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0010800101:493"/>who had never left him a precedent. The following is a tranſlation of the original
<note n="*" place="bottom">Selden, p. 1631.</note>.</p>
                  <p>"To the moſt excellent Gregory, paſtor of the holy church, William, by the grace of God, King of England, and Duke of Normandy, ſendeth, greeting. Hubert, your nuncio, coming unto me in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, adviſed me to do fealty to you and your ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and to take more care in making good the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of money, which my predeceſſors uſed to remit to the church of Rome. One of theſe I have conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, but have refuſed the other. As for fealty, it is what I never have done, nor will do; becauſe I neither obliged myſelf to perform it by any promiſe made by myſelf, nor do I find my predeceſſors ever performed it to yours. As for the money, it was col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in a very bad manner, for almoſt three years, during my abſence in France. But now I am, by God's mercy, returned to my kingdom, I have ſent by the nuncio above-mentioned, what is already collected: as for the remainder, it ſhall be ſent, when convenient, by the legate of Lanfranc, our truſty archbiſhop. We beg your prayers for ourſelves, and the welfare of our kingdom, having born a great regard for your prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and being deſirous of approving our affections and obedience to you above all others."</p>
                  <p>And although this politic Prince was thus compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarily courteous to the Pope, yet he retained the ancient cuſtom of inveſting biſhops and abbots, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them a ring, and a ſtaff, whereby, without more ado, they were put into plenary poſſeſſion of the power and the profits of their benefice; for he always declared he would keep the paſtoral ſtaves in his own hands. Nor would the King ſuffer any in his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to acknowledge the biſhop of Rome for apoſtolical without his command, or to receive the Pope's letters, except they were firſt ſhewn unto him; nor did the King permit the biſhops to paſs ſentence of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0010800101:494"/>againſt any of his barons or officers, although it was for the commiſſion of the moſt heinous crimes, except leave was firſt had and obtained from the King. However, the King did grant to the biſhops the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in religious matters, and the grant of tithes, as well ſmall as great.</p>
                  <p>The King likewiſe made an act for the uniformity of the liturgy, which was to be regulated by that then in uſe at Saliſbury, compoſed by Oſmond biſhop of that ſee.</p>
                  <p>About this time the King had conteſts with the Welch and the Scotch; he levied a numerous army, and marched with reſolution to chaſtiſe and reduce them to obedience. The peace being ſettled, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mind to putting his finances in a condition to ſupply all his neceſſities; and in this no prince, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, had ever greater penetration or invention than he diſcovered in the various means made uſe of for this end, eſpecially as he ſtuck at nothing he judged ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to this point, on which his ſafety ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. The Saxons were already fleeced to gratify his avarice, the Normans were grown opulent by their ſpoils; and as they had for a conſiderable time enjoyed the benefit of his government, he thought it but juſt they ſhould pay their ſhare towards its ſupport; and that he might know what impoſitions they could bear, he ordered an eſtimate to be taken of all the lands in his kingdom. Commiſſioners were appointed, who had a right to make inqueſt, upon oath, upon or near the premiſſes, of the extent and value of the arable, meadow, and paſture land, every individual had. This ſurvey was no leſs than ſix years in making, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in two books. This regiſter was ſometimes called the roll of Wincheſter, becauſe it was depoſited there. It was alſo named Domboc, which name was not given it becauſe it decides any dubious matters, but becauſe it is illegal to depart or appeal from its deciſions. It is now called DOMESDAY-BOOK.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0010800101:495"/>This ſcheme ſucceeded ſo well, that perſons of all ranks were included, and the value of their eſtates pretty well known, ſo as to receive a proportionable taxation. The next year, which was 1084, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for nothing ſo much as the oppreſſive tax of ſix ſhillings upon every hide of land throughout his kingdom. Whether avarice or policy might have given riſe for this oppreſſion, is very uncertain. He applied part of it for building the Tower of London. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection and jealouſies, it occaſioned, are much better conceived than deſcribed. It was very natural for him to fear the reſentment of his ſubjects, if any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity preſented. An invaſion of the Danes indeed ſoon after happened; but the Engliſh did not care to join them, and it was ſoon ſuppreſſed: however, it pleaſed God at length to put a ſtop to his tyrannical reign; for he went to Normandy, A. D. 1087, and died, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a fall from his horſe.</p>
                  <p>From the tranſactions of William's reign, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been a prince of great courage, capacity, and ambition, politic, cruel, vindictive and rapacious, ſtern and haughty in his deportment, reſerved and jealous in his diſpoſition; but though ſudden and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous in his enterpriſes, he was cool and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable in time of danger and difficulty. A late ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous author calls him a <hi>glorious tyrant;</hi> an epithet I ſhall leave my readers to judge of its propriety.</p>

                  <head>WILLIAM II. <hi>ſurnamed</hi> Rufus, A. D. 1087.</head>
                  <p>The Conqueror was ſucceeded by William, his ſecond ſon, called Rufus, from his ruddy complexion, who owed his elevation to that dignity, to Langfranc, arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury. Some oppoſition was indeed agitated, and the nation ſeemed to be in ſome commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but Langfranc wiſely adviſed him to conciliate the affections of the Engliſh: and he accordingly amuſed them with magnificent promiſes to eaſe them
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0010800101:496"/>of their burthenſome tolls and taxes, and allow them the free liberty of hunting. Cajoled by theſe profeſſions, which were void of all ſincerity, the Engliſh adhered to his intereſt; and the Londoners raiſed an army of 30,000 men for his ſervice. But it was not long after, when William began to ſhow ſo much of his father's diſpoſition, as even to procure a new ſurvey of many of the lands in England, and laid heavier taxes upon them. By this and other methods, which diſcovered his rapacious diſpoſition, great conteſts enſued both in Scotland and Wales. A treaty was however brought about, and peace concluded, with Malcolm of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: but William by his inſolence and perfidy ſoon broke the treaty; and when Malcolm ſent ambaſſadors, demanding the performance of the articles in the late treaty, he deſired the Scottiſh King to come in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to his court at Glouceſter, where he ſhould have juſtice done him. Accordingly he came, where he was treated very imperiouſly, and was told he muſt ſubmit the affair to the deciſion of the Engliſh peers. Malcolm rejecting this, returned to his own country; and, glowing with indignation, forthwith aſſembled an army, and invaded Northumberland, which he ravaged as far as Alnwick; when he had ſo far redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the gariſon, that the governor demanded a capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, on pretence of preſenting him the keys on the point of his ſpear, thruſt his weapon into his eye, and killed him on the ſpot.</p>
                  <p>But this is contradicted by Aderic. Vital. Eccleſ. Hiſt. l. 8. p. 701. who ſays that Malcolm was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized under the ſecurity of a treaty, and unexpectedly attacked by Molbray
<note n="*" place="bottom">Collier's Eccleſ. Hiſt. vol. I. p. 263.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Rufus being freed from a powerful enemy, in the perſon of Malcolm, he turned his thoughts to invading his brother Robert's dominions in Normandy; which neither was for the credit nor the advantage of William.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:0010800101:497"/>About this time Langfranc, archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, dying, William the King ſeized the profits of the ſee into his own hands, and kept the church vacant for ſome years, as likewiſe the biſhoprics of Wincheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Durham, and appropriated the profits of thirteen abbeys to his own uſe; by which means he brought immenſe treaſure into his exchequer, and all benefices which he parted with was upon the preſent payment of large ſums
<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the Church of Great Britain, p. 39.</note>.</p>
                  <p>About the year A. D. 1088 began the holy war, and Robert Duke of Normandy, to fit himſelf for ſuch an important expedition, ſold his dukedom for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ten thouſand marks, to his brother William. To pay this money, King Rufus laid a grievous tax over all the realm; extorting it with ſuch ſeverity, that the monks were obliged to ſell their church-plate, and even their chalices; and when the clergy deſired to be eaſed of their burdens, he bid them ſearch for their coffins of gold and ſilver, and dead mens bones.</p>
                  <p>At this time there was a contention at Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Popes, Urban and Clement III. Rufus took part with Clement; but Anſelm acknowledged Urban, and deſired of the King leave to fetch his pall off Urban: all the reſt of the biſhops were againſt him; mean while the King had ſent two meſſengers to the Pope, for the pall; who returned with the Pope's legate, with the pall, to be given to Anſelm: this legate ſo far perſuaded the King, that he acknowledged Urban for Pope. But upon his delivering Anſelm the archbiſhop's pall, thereby making void the inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titure he received from King William, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him afterward to acknowledge his right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture, it gave great diſpleaſure to the King; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he expelled Anſelm his kingdom, confiſcated the lands of the archbiſhopric, and declared that his biſhops did and ſhould hold their ſees of him, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the Pope. Anſelm compromiſed this affair
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0010800101:498"/>by the intervention of friends: upon which he returned to England; but was ſo zealous for maintaining and propagating the opinion of the Pope's ſole right of inveſtiture, that he was again obliged to fly from the kingdom.</p>
                  <p>William the Conqueror having rendered the new Foreſt in Hants, by his devaſtation of towns and churches, a wilderneſs for men, and a paradiſe for deer; King Rufus went there on a party of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, when the King was ſlain by the glance of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſhot by Sir Walter Tirrell.</p>
                  <p>Thus fell William, after the reign of thirteen years, during which he oppreſſed his people in every form of tyranny and inſult. He was equally void of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, principles and humanity; haughty, paſſionate, profligate and ungrateful; a ſcoffer at religion, a ſcourge to the clergy, vain-glorious, rapacious and diſſolute, and an inveterate enemy to the Engliſh, though he owed his crown to their valour and fidelity; when the Normans attempted to deprive him of the crown, ſcarce poſſeſſed of one ſingle virtue, to compenſate for his vices; and, in the words of the celebrated Mr. Pope, DAMNED TO EVERLASTING FAME.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>HENRY I. <hi>ſurnamed</hi> BEAUCLERK, A. D. 1100.</head>
                  <p>Henry, the youngeſt ſon of the Conqueror (ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Beauclerk, which ſignifies a good ſcholar) ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the crown, though, had his brother been in England at the time of Rufus's death, the Engliſh ſeemed more biaſſed in his favour, and he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have acceded to the crown. However, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances favoured Henry's advancement to the throne, though not without ſome tumultuous oppoſition at the election, and he was immediately proclaimed King. And as the people had too much reaſon during the two laſt reigns, to think that a King is very apt to diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his coronation-oath, Henry, for the farther ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0010800101:499"/>of his ſubjects, granted the ſame day a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, confirming their privileges, and redreſſing ſome greivances under which they laboured. By this deed, which was authenticated in the moſt ſolemn manner, and tranſcribed into a great number of copies, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed all over the kingdom, he eſtabliſhed the churches in poſſeſſion of all their immunities, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted them from all the hardſhips they had ſuſtained from the tyranny of Rufus, eſpecially that of being kept vacant for the King's uſe, and afterwards put up to public ſale, without any regard to merit or capacity. He aboliſhed the exceſſive fines which uſed to be exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the heirs of noblemen for the livery of their lands; permitted the natives in general to diſpoſe of their children in marriage, according to their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without paying for a licence from the crown. He ſuppreſſed the duty of moneyage, paid once in three years, in conſideration of the King's preſerving the coins unaltered. He remitted all fines, mulcts, and debts in the exchequer, ariſing from vexatious proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions; allowed the barons to bequeathe their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal eſtates; exempted the lands poſſeſſed by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary tenants of the crown from gelds, talliages and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolences; reſtored the laws of Edward III. relative to murders, thefts, &amp;c. and forgave all rapine and depredation committed to that time, on condition the offenders would make immediate reſtitution.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance of the ſame laudable ſcheme of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and redreſs, he expelled from court all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and inſtruments of his brother's debauchery and arbitrary power, and publiſhed a ſevere edict againſt delinquents and adulterers; he aboliſhed the odious curfew, requiring every man at the ring of a bell at eight o'clock to put out his fire.</p>
                  <p>As Henry had been greatly obliged to the citizens of London in his acquiſition of the crown, he gratified them with another charter of very ample privileges; and, in order to crown the ſatisfaction of the people, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0010800101:500"/>Anſelm, archbiſhop of Canterbury, who was become exceeding popular in England through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the monks. The prelate accepted the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation with tranſport, and ſoon after landed at Dover; but the King was greatly diſappointed when he found that Anſelm refuſed to do him homage, adhering to the canons of the council of Bari, which forbad eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics to receive inveſtitures from the laity, or to pay them homage on any account; and the conditions of their living together in a good underſtanding were, that the king ſhould relinquiſh the prerogative of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting biſhops and abbots, and pay an implicit obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Pope. Henry, though ſhocked at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent propoſals of this arrogant prieſt, who wanted to curtail his authority, was forced to temporize. For about this time his brother Robert aſſerts his claim to the Engliſh crown, and if Anſelm's intereſt were to have been thrown in that ſcale, it might preponderate on that ſide; and even, notwithſtanding, the king's moderation, when Robert his brother made a deſcent at Portſmouth, he found the people's mind fluctuating, and the King was obliged to depend, in ſome meaſure, on the eloquence and intereſt of Anſelm, to preſerve peace and loyalty to his majeſty; ſo that at length af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were compromiſed. Henry now proceeded with rigour againſt many of the nobles who had promoted the invaſion by his brother: ſome were baniſhed, their eſtates ſeized, &amp;c. while he rewarded others for their zealous attachment to his royal perſon.</p>
                  <p>But all the nobles in the land were more eaſily managed than the archbiſhop of Canterbury, who was a true monk and bigot to the church of Rome. For his deſign was to accompliſh two projects: the firſt was to eſtabliſh celibacy among eccleſiaſtics; (Anſelm called a council at Weſtminſter, where firſt he excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated all married prieſts, though half the clergy at that time were married;) and the ſecond, to hinder biſhops and abbots from receiving the inveſtiture of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0010800101:501"/>their benefices from the King. The Pope had given his orders for inſiſting upon the execution of the canons againſt lay inveſtiture; nevertheleſs, the King refuſed to part with his prerogative, and Anſelm refuſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the biſhops whom Henry had appointed. This produced a quarrel, which at length Anſelm reſolved to go and lay before Pope Paſcal II. A. D. 1103; and he was accompanied by ſome biſhops, who had quitted their benefices, rather than acknowlege the King's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy; and the King ſent two ambaſſadors at the ſame time to defend his cauſe. But notwithſtanding their remonſtrance the Pope remained inflexible, and would not make any conceſſions, though he wrote a letter to the King in mild terms, telling him, "He ſhould be glad to oblige him in any thing that was conſiſtent with juſtice; that he had no deſign of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon his prerogative; but the granting the right of inveſtiture to a layman was not in his power, as it was an eſſential property of church-government."</p>
                  <p>The King was not well pleaſed with the Pope's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and ordered his ambaſſadors to acquaint Anſelm, that he did not deſire to ſee him in England, unleſs he was reſolved to conform to the example of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt Henry was abroad in Normandy, he received an expoſtulatory letter from the Pope, by the hand of Anſelm, and the King allowed him to return to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
                  <p>When Anſelm arrived here, he was received very joyfully; and repairing to Canterbury with the pall in a ſilver box, the archbiſhop went bare-footed to meet him, attended by all the monks of St. Auguſtine and Chriſt-church.</p>
                  <p>A legate was likewiſe ſent by, Pope Henorius II. to go to England and Scotland in the quality of legate <hi>à latere,</hi> and on his arrival was received by the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury with all the honours due to his character. The legate being commiſſioned to enquire
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0010800101:502"/>into the diſſentions between the archbiſhop of York and the Scotch prelates, who refuſed to acknowledge his primacy, went to Roxburgh, where he held a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with David, King of Scotland, on that ſubject. On his return, he preſided at a general convocation of the prelates and clergy, where, to ſhew his authority, he was ſeated on an eminence above the ſeats of the archbiſhops and temporal lords, who attended the council, which was very diſagreeable to many of the Engliſh, and the council ended with no important ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
                  <p>We might enlarge in the hiſtory of the reign of Henry I. by a variety of tranſactions of a civil nature; but as that is not my province, ſhall conclude with only obſerving, that he died of a fever, A. D. 1135, and ſhall ſum up his character in a few words. He was too fond of foreigners, too vindictive to his enemies, too ſenſible to be an enthuſiaſt, too cautious to be ſurpriſed, too valiant to be conquered, too good to deſerve the calumnies caſt on him by the monks, and too bad to be generally applauded.</p>

                  <head>STEPHEN, A. D. 1135.</head>
                  <p>Stephen aſcending the throne, after being elected, rather by a cabal of prelates and noblemen, than by a general conſent of the nation, reſolved to ſecure the favour of the nation by ſome extraordinary conceſſions; and therefore over and above his promiſe of ruling with equity and moderation, he ſolemnly ſwore that he would not retain vacant ſees and benefices in his hands, but fill them immediately with perſons cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically elected; that he would not diſturb the clergy or laity in the enjoyment of their woods; that he would not ſue any perſon for hunting in the royal fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; that he would never exact the tax of danegelt. The Engliſh were ſo credulous as to believe he would pay a greater regard to it, than was evident from his future conduct. However, partly through his own
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0010800101:503"/>treachery and miſconduct, his whole reign was a ſcene of war and conteſt, both abroad and at home. We meet with very few tranſactions relative to learning or religion. There were however many religious founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions built and endowed in the troubleſome reign of King Stephen; as the monaſtery of St. Mary de Pratis, founded by Robert, Earl of Leiceſter; the hoſpital of St. Catherine, near London, founded by Maud, wife of King Stephen; and St. Stephen's chapel at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, founded by himſelf; as alſo the Ciſtertian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtry at Feverſham, with an hoſpital near the Weſt-gate at York, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He died after a ſhort illneſs in 1154. His character is that of humane and generous: he ſeems to have been poſſeſſed of many great qualities; and, had he lived in happier times, he might probably have been reckoned one of the moſt illuſtrious monarchs that ever filled the Engliſh throne.</p>

                  <head>HENRY II. A. D. 1154.</head>
                  <p>Henry came to the crown with an indiſputable title. He was a prince, wiſe, valiant, and generally fortunate. Soon after his acceſſion to the throne, he choſe a privy-council of clergy and temporality, and refined the common laws. He parcelled England into ſix di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and appointed three judges to every circuit. He eraſed many of the caſtles to the ground, as he found they were held by perſons in a kind of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the crown, and derogatory to the authority of it. Theſe regulations ſeem firſt and principally to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs his attention, but he afterwards found others to demand his concern. The groſs impoſitions of the Pope highly threatened the diminution of his royal prerogatives; ſo that he diſclaimed the Pope's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, refufed to pay Peter-pence, and interdicted all appeals to Rome. But he only, or chiefly, regarded his temporal prerogatives; for had not they been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0010800101:504"/>by the prelates, under the direction of the Pope, they might have continued their influence in the church in all ſpiritual affairs. However, the King was not ſufficiently upon his guard in the choice of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites.</p>
                  <p>Thomas Becket, doctor of canon law, was, by the King, made chancellor of England; and four years after he was, by the King, made archbiſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury; and this, in proceſs of time, proved highly prejudicial to his majeſty's authority. One of the firſt matters of diſpute was, that the King having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that juſtice ſhould be impartially executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men in his court, Becket inſiſted on the clergy being exempt from the juriſdiction of the civil magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, and judged in the eccleſiaſtical court. This incenſed the King againſt him. To adjuſt matters of importance, the King called a parliament at Clarenden, to confirm the antient laws and cuſtoms; to which Becket and the reſt of the biſhops conſented, and ſubſcribed to them; but Becket afterwards recanting, renounced the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The ſame year, A. D. 1160, the King required that the law ſhould be put in execution for ſome crimes committed by the clergy, which the archbiſhop would not permit; and, without the King's knowledge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to repair to Rome and lay the affair before the Pope. And this was a matter of debate for ſome years.</p>
                  <p>Matthew Paris recites a variety of letters between this Pope and the King, and between the Pope and the King of France. By the mediation of the latter, Becket had leave to return to England; however the King ſtill retained his temporal authority.</p>
                  <p>Upon Becket's return to England, he excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ſeveral Biſhops. The next year he excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated lord Sackville, who had been appointed by the King vicar of the church of Canterbury, as he had
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0010800101:505"/>derogated, as he called it, from the rights of the church to pleaſe the King.</p>
                  <p>The King being then in Normandy, complained greatly, to ſome of his domeſtics, of the inſolent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of Becket, whom he had raiſed from abject circumſtances to ſuch dignity, and yet by ſuch unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled ingratitude became the continual diſturber of his government. Authors vary greatly in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, and hiſtory affords us nothing certain with reſpect to the motives of the perſons who came over to aſſaſſinate Becket. Whether they were incited to it by the King, and received any promiſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for ſo raſh an action; or whether they were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by principle only, and a regard to the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the nation; be this as it will, William de Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Reginald Fitzurſe, Hugh de Moreville, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Brito, mutually engaged to revenge the King's quarrel. They withdrew from court, and taking ſhipping at different ports, arrived in England, and met at the caſtle of Saltwode, within ſix miles of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury. The next day they went to Canterbury, and advanced to Becket's apartment, where they warmly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated with him about the raſhneſs and inſolence of his conduct in his ſtation as chancellor, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as archbiſhop; which making no impreſſion upon him, it is ſaid, they retired to put on their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ſoon returned to execute the aſſaſſination, which they did with many circumſtances of cruelty.</p>
                  <p>Collier ſays
<note n="*" place="bottom">Collier's Eccleſ. Hiſt. vol. I. p. 375.</note>, "That, upon the news of the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop's death, the King and the people were extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled; though it may be eaſily conjectured to proceed from different motives. The King was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive that the archbiſhop's murder would occaſion reflection and diſhonour to his highneſs; and ſo, in fact, it did ſoon. The King of France wrote to his holineſs, in which he made no ſcruple to charge him as culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in that act; and intimated, that the Pope ſhould
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0010800101:506"/>draw St. Peter's ſword againſt King Henry, and even to think of ſome new and exemplary puniſhment for a crime in which the univerſal church was concerned. This was likewiſe followed with another from the Earl of Blois, and another from the archbiſhop of Sens, in which he moves for an interdict upon his dominions.</p>
                  <p>King Henry proteſted his innocence, and ſent an embaſſy to Rome, upon his arrival in England, about that time, to compromiſe matters; and either from a conſciouſneſs of his fault, or motives of policy, agreed to purchaſe his abſolution upon very ſevere terms. The Pope enjoined him to ſuffer appeals from England to Rome; to quit his right and claim to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtitures; to keep 200 men in arms for the holy war; and to pay forty thouſand marks of ſilver, and five thouſand of gold. Some add, that he ſubmitted to ſtrip himſelf naked at Canterbury, and to he laſhed by divers monks, ſome of whom gave him five, others three ſtripes. This was in A. D. 1170, and the Pope canonized Becket for a ſaint.</p>
                  <p>During this reign, a conſiderable number of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans came over to England, to attempt a reformation from ſome of the groſs errors of Popery. Authors differ as to their number. The ſentiments and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of theſe men but agree in this, that they were ſeverely treated, by branding them with hot irons, and by other methods of cruelty; ſome were even put to death, which they bore with great fortitude.</p>
                  <p>The reign of Henry abounds with many acts which redound to his honour, notwithſtanding his foibles, which derogate from it. He was educated with high notions of the kingly prerogative, for which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted the moſt inviolable attachment; and he guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the liberties of his ſubjects by many excellent laws and regulations. So that, upon the whole, he is rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the moſt powerful and illuſtrious of the Engliſh monarchs.</p>
