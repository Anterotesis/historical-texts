            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FROM the very eminent line you are ranked in as a vocal performer, and the great pleaſure I have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived when I have heard you ſing ſome of the following Songs, I thought there would be no impropriety, truſting at the ſame time that you would not take it amiſs, were I to inſcribe the following little work to you. I have been the more particularly urged to publiſh my ſongs in this manner, from hearing of the frequent applications which have been made for them to almoſt every bookſeller in town, who have not had it in their power until now, to gratify their different cuſtomers. There are more people
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0751700800:3"/>
capable of reading than ſinging a ſong, therefore, thoſe that have not ſtudied mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic ſufficiently, may have the opportunity of looking over the words in the cloſet; many of them have been ſet by ſome of the moſt able compoſers, and many alſo by the moſt moderate ones; which have often been the cauſe of putting the reader out of humour with the words, from the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician's miſconception of the ſubject, or his deficiency in reſpect to effect and harmony. Many an author has had the mortification of ſeeing his words martyred by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of the muſic, who has evidently ſhewn, by his emphaſis (if I may be allowed that phraſe) being wrongly placed, that although he might be full maſter of his ſcience, ſo far as to know a crotchet from a minim, yet if you had ſet him to read, perhaps, he did not know a ſubſtantive from a verb, and a total ſtranger altogether of antitheſis or inflection; in ſuch caſe, good words are often proſtituted through ignorance, which is as mortifying as if any body were to put a valuable piece of broad cloth into the hands of an unſkilful Taylor, who having no taſte, in reſpect to faſhion or ſhape,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0751700800:4"/>
often produces a coat not only unfit to be worn, but unfit to be ſeen alſo, from which reaſon, it has diſguſted, and been thrown upon the ſhelf to rot in oblivion. And on the other hand, many a ſong which has been meerly <hi>meaſure,</hi> without the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the name of Poetry, diveſted at the ſame time of inſtructive matter as well as of figure or incident, has become a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ditty with the Public, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of the compoſer of the muſic, who may have been lucky enough to give it a good tune.</p>
            <p>In the above inſtance we are told the Italian compoſers do often excel; and the late ingenious Bonnel Thornton, joint writer of the Connoiſieur, has, in ſome part of his works, given us a tranſlation of one of their popular airs, which we alſo find to be ſtrictly <hi>meaſure,</hi> and runs thus:
<q>
                  <l>" Where, which, and wherefore,</l>
                  <l>" There, this, and therefore!!!"</l>
               </q>
This is a kind of faſhionable <hi>ſcaffolding</hi> for the muſic, which the compoſer <hi>builds</hi> upon,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0751700800:5"/>
and finiſhes his part by <hi>line</hi> and <hi>rule,</hi> like a good maſon or bricklayer, who never conſiders, or looks into the imperfection of the architect, but is perfectly contented that he has finiſhed <hi>his</hi> part of the buſineſs well, let the ſuperſtructure be ever ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible; but you are a better judge of muſic than I am, and if this metaphor ſhould not hold good, you will be kind enough to pardon,</p>
