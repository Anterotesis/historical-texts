            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>EXPLANATION OF THE ANNEXED PLAN.</head>
            <p>THE town (diſtinguiſhed by being coloured red) is contained in a ſquare, each ſide of which is 4 furlongs, or half a mile; having a ſquare furlong, or 10 acres, in the centre, appropriated to public offices (<hi>viz.</hi> a church, town-hall, guard-houſe, ſeparate penitentiary lots (or priſons) for males and females; alſo ſchools for each ſex, and a public caravanſera for ſtrangers and travellers, under the control of the conſtable on guard by rotation). The Breadth of the ſtreets and highways is propoſed to be the 8th part of a furlong, or 82 feet 6 inches; which will allow room for aquaducts wherever ſtreams of water can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced from ſuperior levels, and alſo room for planting ranges of ſpreading trees to ſhelter the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths. And as the bounds of each ſquare furlong meet in the centre of the ſtreets, meaſured from the 4 external edges or ſides of the town (coloured red), which are diſtant, each from its oppoſite ſide, 4 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete furlongs, or half a mile (4 inches by the ſcale), theſe external edges or lines of the town and the ſtreets muſt be firſt laid out, that the remaining ſpace, in each ſquare furlong of the town, may be divided into <hi>town-lots</hi> in equal proportions, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 oppoſite ſides of the town are appropriated to large town-lots of nearly one acre each for PLANTERS or FARMERS;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0806200600:4"/>and as theſe <hi>large town-lots</hi> commence from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal edge of the town (and not from the centre of the ſtreets, like the <hi>ſmall town-lots</hi>), their length will be a complete half furlong, or 330 feet: In their breadth there will be ſome variation: The uppermoſt and undermoſt diviſions of ſquare furlongs, being meaſured from the external edges, or red lines, at the top and bottom of the town (as repreſented in this Plan), have a deduction of 41 feet 3 inches for half the width of the ſtreet on one ſide only; which, ſubtracted from 660 feet, the breadth of the furlong, leaves a ſpace of 618 feet 9 inches for the breadth of 5 lots: Which ſpace divided by 5 allows the breadth of each PLANTER'S TOWN-LOT, in the uppermoſt and lowermoſt diviſions to be 123 feet 9 inches includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fences; and the PLANTERS <hi>town-lots,</hi> in the 4 central diviſions (as the central diviſions have a ſtreet on 2 ſides), muſt loſe 82 feet 6 inches from the width of each furlong, which being firſt deducted from the 660 feet leave a breadth of only 577 feet 6 inches to be divided into 5 equal parts, whereby the width of the PLANTERS <hi>lots</hi> in the 4 central diviſions, is reduced to 115 feet 6 inches each, including the fences.</p>
            <p>The ſize of the ſmall town-lots will alſo unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably vary, and be of two different dimenſions as to their <hi>breadth,</hi> though all are of equal <hi>length:</hi> For as they are meaſured from the centre of each ſquare furlong to the centre of the ſtreets, a deduction of 41 feet 3 inches (half the width of the ſtreets) muſt be made from the <hi>length</hi> of half a furlong, or 330 feet, which reduces the length of each lot to 288 feet 9 inches. And 41 feet 3 inches being alſo deducted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0806200600:5"/>from the <hi>breadth</hi> of the uppermoſt and loweſt ranges of ſquare furlongs, for half the width of the ſtreet, on one ſide of each furlong, the ſpace for the width of 6 lots is thereby reduced to 618 feet 9 inches, which divided by 6 gives 103 feet 1 inch and half, for the width of each lot, including the fences: And 82 feet 6 inches being deducted from the central diviſions, for half the width of the ſtreets on 2 ſides of each diviſion, or ſquare furlong, reduce the ſpace for 6 lots to 577 feet 6 inches, which divided by 6 gives only 96 feet 3 inches for the width of the <hi>ſmall town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi> in the <hi>central</hi> diviſions, including their reſpective fences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> In old ſettled countries, where land is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready of conſiderable value, it is not to be ſuppoſed that the proprietors of land can be induced to <hi>give gratis</hi> more than the <hi>ſmall town-lots</hi> of half an acre and a few poles each, which with the roads and ſtreets will amount to about 120 acres to be given <hi>gratis</hi> out of 2560 acres, or leſs than 4 ¾ per cent.; and the improved value of the remaining eſtate, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, will amply repay the donation; as the value of land is generally doubled by the proximity of a town.</p>
            <p>And as even this laſt propoſed donation of 120 acres will be much too large a venture for land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders in general to riſque in ſuch an experiment; it is neceſſary to remark, that they may proceed on the half of this plan, quite as effectually, by dividing the town and townſhip in the centre, whereby the land to be <hi>given gratis,</hi> or granted in <hi>freehold</hi> to the ſettlers, will not exceed 60 acres: And even with this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0806200600:6"/>large reduction of the plan, ſpace will be reſerved for the families of 20 farmers or planters and of 68 ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers or labourers; and as the line of diviſion in this latter mode will paſs through the centre ſquare of the preſent plan, 6 additional ſmall town-lots may be formed in the ſpace of half the ſquare, and half of the public lots around it, which will enable the town, upon the whole, to contain 94 houſeholds. And if 6 cottages for labourers be added at the outer gates or avenues of the eſtate, the community will form a complete <hi>hundred</hi> of houſeholders, which is a very reſpectable body of people for maintaining peace and good order according to the common law of England.</p>
            <p>Whenever only <hi>one half</hi> of the plan is adopted, the ſide where the central line of diviſion is made muſt be placed next to the water (whether the ſea or river, creek or canal), and care muſt be taken that a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>ſtrand,</hi> or ſpace of <hi>common land,</hi> be reſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the town and the water, that all the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants may have equal acceſs to the water-ſide.</p>

               <head>A DESCRIPTION OF FRANKPLEDGE.</head>
               <p>FRANKPLEDGE is an ancient patriarchal mode of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranging the families, or rather <hi>houſeholds,</hi> of a nation,

                     <p>See Deut. i. 13-15. <hi>"Take ye"</hi> (or rather, according to the Hebrew, "CHUSE YE <hi>to</hi> YOURSELVES") <q>

                        </q> (which neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that the tribes were to nominate), <hi>"and I"</hi> (ſaid Moſes) <hi>"will make them rulers over you"</hi> (i. e. the returns of the elections were to be made to Moſes, and he was to inveſt the elected with public authority); <hi>"and ye"</hi> (ſaid Moſes) <q>

                        </q> (Thus Moſes, like a good politician, and faithful public miniſter under God, declared the <hi>free aſſent</hi> of the people, whereby the important meaſure he himſelf had propoſed of eſtabliſhing Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pledge by the advice of Jethro, was enacted, and became a public law, or ſtatute, of that nation (Iſrael), as much as it has been enacted to Engliſhmen by MAGNA CHARTA). <hi>"So I took"</hi> (ſaid Moſes) <hi>"the chief of your tribes, wiſe men and known"</hi> (that is, <hi>"known among the tribes,"</hi> as expreſſed in the 13th verſe) which neceſſary qualification could not fairly be aſcertained, unleſs the <hi>known men</hi> were really returned, or named, to Moſes, as ſuch, by the tribes themſelves), <hi>"and made them heads over you, captains"</hi> (or heads) <hi>"over</hi> THOUSANDS, <hi>and captains over</hi> HUNDREDS" (what we call <hi>hundreders,</hi> or high conſtables), <q>

                     <p>Thus it appears that the officers in general, from the colonel or captain of a thouſand (whether of individuals or families), down to the ſerjeant, conſtable, or tythingman, were recommended, or rather nominated by the people, before they were inveſted with authority by Moſes.</p>

            <head>EXTRACT OF A <hi>LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR,</hi> TO A GENTLEMAN IN THE EAST INDIES.</head>
            <p>FROM ſome late determinations in the courts of Bengal againſt Slave Dealers, and oppreſſors of the poor labouring natives (accounts of which have been publiſhed in our Engliſh newſpapers), the Public here, in general, are well ſatisfied that the poor natives in India are <hi>free,</hi> and receive <hi>wages for their labour:</hi> And, conſequently, all the moſt ſteady friends to the meaſure of <hi>aboliſhing the Slave Trade</hi> are ſolicitous to promote the uſe and ſale of <hi>Eaſt India Sugar,</hi> in preference to that which is cultivated <hi>by Slaves</hi> elſewhere: So that you may be aſſured that the <hi>Sugar Trade from India</hi> may be immenſely increaſed, and the value of the new-acquired lands in India may be amply advanced for the benefit of the Hon. Eaſt India Company (or of the proprietors of Eaſt Indian lands in general), if due care be taken by the Company's agents and ſervants to ſatisfy Europeans that the Eaſt India Sugar continues to be really the produce of <hi>free labour:</hi> And care muſt alſo be taken to prevent <hi>Weſt Indian</hi> adventurers, or others, from forming plantations in any of the new-acquired
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0806200600:17"/>Indian lands (now become Britiſh territory) on any other plan, than that of <hi>free labour;</hi> that the baneful and iniquitous practice of <q>
                  <hi>exacting la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour without wages</hi>
               </q> may be effectually prevented, and be duly deemed as deteſtable among men, as it is, certainly, abominable in the ſight of God! All impoſing contracts for labour ſhould alſo be vigilantly guarded againſt by the adminiſtrators of government in the ſeveral Indian departments; for, next after the <hi>abolition of the Slave Trade</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> the moſt important conſideration certainly is, how to place the poor labouring natives of India in ſuch a happy ſtate of permanent eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as may inſure to them a general ſubſiſtence independent of the caprice and injuſtice of mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizers, and the graſping ſpeculations of merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary adventures; and yet, with ſuch moderation in this little elevation of their condition, that they may ſtill feel ſufficient inducement to prompt their <hi>induſtry</hi> for the public good. To this point I have lately turned my thoughts, and have reaſon to think, that it may eaſily be effected, not only to the advantage and ſecurity of the induſtrious poor, and to the general promotion of trade in the numerous articles which the labourers, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> little elevation of their condition, will be enabled to purchaſe; but alſo, at the ſame time, to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>very great advantage and profit of the rich.</hi> I mean thoſe that have much <hi>landed property,</hi> and have thereby the power of carrying ſuch a plan into execution. For by granting a very ſmall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

And, by the ſame means (I am perſuaded), the value of the new-acquired lands in India may be exceedingly enhanced, as well for the advantage of the natives as for the Hon. Eaſt India Company, and of all their agents and ſervants, in caſe the latter ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to realize their fortunes (acquired in India) by inveſtments of <hi>landed property,</hi> purchaſed either of the Company, or of the native proprietors; eſpecially as the increaſing demand for <hi>Eaſt Indian Sugar</hi> affords great encouragement for cultivating lands in India; and there are many other branches of huſbandry, hitherto neglected in India, as the planting of <hi>ſago trees,</hi> and a variety of other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable <hi>productive vegetables,</hi> which would enrich the occupiers of land; and amply aſſord a due compence to the induſtrious labourers.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0806200600:19"/>the <hi>Indian nations,</hi> will be charged with objections too commonly deemed <hi>inſuperable</hi> by Europeans that have dwelt among them, and who, therefore, ought to be beſt acquainted with their diſpoſitions. The inveterate prejudices of the Gentoos, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the (imaginary) inſcrutable antiquity of the Braminical traditions, and their (ſuppoſed) <hi>unalienable</hi> attachment to their religion, will be alleged. But how ſhall we venture to rely on the experience and conſequent opinions of moſt of the Europeans that have lived among them, in a point, which they are ſo far from having attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inveſtigate with candour, that many of them, through a lamentable neglect or ignorance of chriſtianity and ancient hiſtory, have rather been inclined blindly to adopt, than to confute, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities of Gentooiſm?</p>
            <p>One Engliſh gentleman, though he is neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in underſtanding nor in experience and knowledge of the manners and diſpoſitions of the Gentoos, has very gravely informed us of a great ſimilarity between the <hi>Moſaical Laws</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Gentoos.</hi> But this gentleman (whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nevolent intentions I do not at all queſtion, or even ſuſpect) has not been ſufficiently aware o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Satan will always endeavour to appear as an Angel of Light,</hi>
               </q> and all his votaries wear a maſk of very oppoſite features from thoſe that are hid by it! But ſome even of the very laws which are included in this gentleman's publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which are, thereby, expoſed to the light of truth and common ſenſe, afford ample confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his own remark; for by theſe it appears, that <hi>the Gentoo laws</hi> proceed by a <hi>ſeven-fold</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of IN-EQUITY (i. e. a <hi>numerical perfection</hi> of IN-IQUITY), extorting from the poor <hi>Sooders</hi> fines of <hi>ſeven times</hi> the value that are required of the Bramins for <hi>the very ſame offences;</hi> though the <hi>Laws of God,</hi> declared by Moſes (to which they have been very injudiciouſly compared), abſolutely prohibit <hi>any reſpect of perſons in judgment.</hi> And notwithſtanding the pretended <hi>mildneſs</hi> of theſe laws, yet the cloven foot is apparent; for the Sooder is doomed to be <hi>burned alive</hi> for <hi>fornication</hi> with a Bramin woman, even though ſhe ſhould have been proved the firſt ſeducer; whereas the Bramin, for the abominable and irreparable injury to a female Sooder, even of a <hi>violent rape,</hi> is let off for a <hi>ſmall fine!</hi> And this deteſtable and enormous iniquity is even eſtabliſhed by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged law! Nay there is an expreſs law to inſure to the <hi>Bramins</hi> the groſs privilege (which they claim for the indulgence of their luſt) that <q>
                  <hi>it is lawful for a Bramin to tell a lie to deceive a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0806200600:21"/>woman.</hi>
               </q> And yet with all theſe <hi>abominable</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, bad as they are, their iniquity is ſtill aggravated by the <hi>blaſphemous</hi> falſehood, that their deceitful caſt <q>
                  <hi>proceeded from the mouth of the Creator, other caſts from inferior parts of his body, and the Sooders from the ſoles of his fect.</hi>
               </q> Satan could not ſuggeſt a more malicious calumny againſt, the <hi>divine juſtice!</hi> It is ſo evident a token of <hi>"the myſtery of iniquity</hi>
and <hi>"working of Satan,"</hi> that we need not ſearch farther in the <hi>Gentoo Laws</hi> for the declared <hi>"Doctrines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,"</hi> the two revealed marks of <hi>"the myſtery of iniquity"</hi> by which Chriſtians are warned to know <hi>"the man of ſin,"</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

For as the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>"deluding ſpirits"</hi> is manifeſted, in the apoſtate church of the Roman Empire, by the open aſſumption of a <hi>pagan title of prieſthood,</hi> PONTIFEX, and, ſtill more eſpecially, by that moſt preſumptuous title of pretended <hi>infallibility,</hi> and <hi>univerſal dominion,</hi> PONTIFEX MAXIMUS, through which this dangerous uſurper of unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited power (under the maſque of religion) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the <hi>true "image of the beaſt,"</hi> the former IMPERIAL PONTIFICES, or <hi>Heathen Emperors,</hi> who did not more haughtily ſuppreſs the natural rights of mankind than did their ſucceſſors the PAPAL
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0806200600:22"/>PONTIFICES, in proclaiming <hi>Cruſades,</hi> and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing lawleſs Princes to wage <hi>bloody</hi> and <hi>deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> wars againſt all perſons that oppoſed their <hi>image</hi> worſhip, and other <hi>antichriſtian</hi> corruptions; and in eſtabliſhing bloody <hi>inquiſitions</hi> to maintain this horrible tyranny! So the ſame unnatural <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition</hi> may as evidently be traced to its <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſource by the baneful fruits and bloody track of <hi>inquiſitorial</hi> cruelty and tyranny manifeſted in the Laws of the Bramins lately publiſhed; as the <hi>cutting off the</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>buttock of a Sooder,</hi> for <hi>ſitting on the carpet of a Bramin!</hi> the <hi>cramming a red-hot iron</hi> into their mouths for repeating any words of the Beads or Shaſter!</q> and the <hi>pouring hot wax into their ears</hi> for ſitting to hear them read! If the Beads contained any good, it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate <hi>Popery,</hi> thus to prohibit the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of what is <hi>good from the vulgar,</hi> like the univerſal prohibition of the Scriptures in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacular tongues wherever <hi>the beaſt</hi> prevails! But there can be no doubt, if the Sooders were duly protected by government from the fear of ſuch <hi>frightful penalties,</hi> that they would not be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to acknowledge their <hi>juſt and equal claims</hi> to <hi>all the rights of mankind.</hi> And I need only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>theſe ſevere laws</hi> as ample and ſufficient proofs to confute the prejudices of gentlemen infallibly experienced (as they ſuppoſe) by their reſidence in India, reſpecting the imaginary <hi>unalienable</hi> attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Hindoos to their falſe religion; for unleſs the Bramins themſelves had known that the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0806200600:23"/>other Hindoos were <hi>much inclined</hi> to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>equally men</hi> with the Bramins, and to be, thereby, entitled to all <hi>equal rights</hi> and <hi>natural juſtice,</hi> they would not have diſgraced their code of laws with ſuch enormities! <hi>Frankpledge</hi> is the only ſafe mode of reſtoring theſe poor people to their <hi>juſt rights,</hi> and it was neceſſary for me, <hi>thus far,</hi> to guard againſt the obvious objections that would be made by many gentlemen who preſume much on their own experimental knowledge of the Gentoos.</p>
