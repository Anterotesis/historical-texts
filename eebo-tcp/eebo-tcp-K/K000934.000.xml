            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>GENERAL GAGE's Proclamation lies before
me, though it is not a ſubject for criticiſm, yet
it deſerves notice; we may overlook the ſtyle, but
muſt deteſt the doctrine; with what judgment the
General may command, with what ſpirit he
may fight, with what prudence he may retreat, is
yet unknown; but if his conduct in the field is
equal to his compoſition in the cloſet, the ſucceſs
of his majeſty's arms muſt be owing more to fate
than judgment. This murderous proclamation
opens with great ſolemnity, bold aſſertions, and
notorious falſehoods; it proceeds with the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
ſpirit of the times; but, alas! its imperious
offers of clemency, and its conceited menaces,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1058401600:4"/>
are vain alike. The one will make no converts
for want of confidence; and the other can make
no cowards for want of power. To ſubjugate
America entirely, by means of our fleet and
ſtanding army, is impoſſible; the thought only
proves that adminiſtration is as weak as it is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
ſhould they be determined, like their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided
maſter, to perſevere, they will, ere long,
find it impracticable either to go forward, or to
retreat; they will (let them mark the words of an
unknown writer) oblige the people, throughout
the empire of Great Britain, to take the power
again into their own hands; even anarchy is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
to deſpotiſm, eſpecially while the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is in the hands of fools, madmen, knaves,
and tyrants; hard uſage juſtifies hard names.—Let
us now proceed to this alluring proclamation, this
flimſy, political trap for antiquated Roman vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>The General thought fit to arraign the conduct
of the Americans as incendiaries and traitors
againſt the conſtitutional authority of the ſtate; if
the word incendiary has any meaning in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
language, it can only be applied with propriety
to one who is the firſt kindler of commotions in a
ſtate; according to our conſtitution, the very head
that wears the crown may be an incendiary, by
encouraging a faction, which may as well originate
in the court as in the cottage, if the King and his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1058401600:5"/>
Parliament, devoted to a vile adminiſtration, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
to perſevere in carrying any one point againſt
the conſtitution, they are from that moment a fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(incendiaries) and not a government; they
are traitors, traitors to the people. Let me now
aſk, whether faction firſt took riſe in America, or
the mother country? In that ſpot (wherever it
may be) we muſt look for theſe incendiaries and
traitors. I have put the queſtion fairly; it is ſimple,
plain, and determinative.—I pauſe for a reply—
not from the mouth of a haughty penſioner, a
Scotch placeman, or a fawning courtier; but by
the deciſion of a true conſtitutionaliſt I am willing
to abide. In the interim, I ſhall declare my own
opinion—That the mother country, repreſented
as ſhe is by a corrupt majority, firſt formed a fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
herſelf againſt the laws and liberties of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;
nay, ſhe has done more, ſhe has artfully
formed even a religious faction (the worſt of all
others) upon that great continent. Her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
has of late been adminiſtered upon ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
narrow, rotten principles, that ſhe did not
think herſelf ſecure till ſhe had eſtabliſhed Popery
by act of Parliament at Quebec, by way of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
diſſentions and enmity in thoſe dominions
ſhe would enſlave, or adminiſtration knew and
feared the principles of the people upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.
They had read that their anceſtors were
Puritans, and no friends to tyranny or popery;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1058401600:6"/>
they knew their deſigns, and planted Papiſts in
their rear to keep their rebellious ſubjects, as they
call them, between two fires, and to deter them
from taking refuge in the back ſettlements; but
they have numbers and virtue ſufficient to enable
them to keep, or at leaſt to recover their ground.
Thus have a corrupt majority, falſely called the
Great Council of the Nation, themſelves departed,
and encouraged Government to depart, in this as
well as numberleſs other inſtances, from the line
of right laid down at the Revolution, a period but
little reverenced by our State-pilots, Bute and
Mansfield; theſe two men, with their lacqueys in
and out of Parliament, are the real and only incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries
of America. The wretched Americans,
unjuſtly branded by every hireling with the name
of traitors, are only buſied, and juſtly buſied, in
extinguiſhing thoſe flames, which ſuch a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(if it deſerves the name of one) has kindled;
whether the Americans are traitors, or unhappy
ſubjects making a lawful reſiſtance to repeated
tyrannies, muſt be determined, not by hirelings,
who aſſaſſinate for pay, but by thoſe who pay
them with reluctance, by the collective body of
the people, in whom all power virtually reſides,
from whom it originates, and to whom it muſt
perhaps ſhortly diſſolve again. What the General
calls treaſon, this collective body (an awful tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal)
will pronounce conſtitutional reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1058401600:7"/>
The Americans are next accuſed of a fatal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
of crimes againſt the conſtitutional autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the ſtate.—By the term conſtitutional, if the
General means an authority conſtitutionally exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
I deny his aſſertion; it is as little founded
on truth, as our miniſterial meaſures are upon
ſound policy, juſtice and humanity; when the
principles of the conſtitution are abandoned (as
they have lately been) the ſtate may proceed au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritively,
or rather deſpotically, but it cannot
be ſaid to act conſtitutionally.—That the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
avow rebellion, I deny likewiſe; that they
avow reſiſtance (as their brave anceſtors once did,
and as all true Revolutioniſts will do) every Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
as an enemy to ſlavery, muſt rejoice.</p>
            <p>For the patience and lenity of the King's (in
truth of Lord Bute's and Lord Mansfield's) go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
I appeal to facts. Thoſe, who are
maſters of the diſputes between England and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
and ſtand unbiaſſed by corruption, will paſs
an impartial judgment between the oppreſſors and
oppreſſed; we doubt not but the Sovereign's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
is equal to his other godlike attributes; but
we know that the patience of America has been
ſeverely tried; among other invaſions ſhe has been
ſtripped of the moſt valuable privilege, the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
of a Britiſh ſubject, trial by juries. In many
other inſtances government has attempted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave
them; and ſhall the aggreſſors preſume to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1058401600:8"/>
boaſt thus of their patience and lenity? At what time,
in what particulars, were they exerted? Were the
humble ſupplications and remonſtrances of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica
received by either, and by which of the three
great eſtates of this kingdom? If ſo, a Norton
and Apſley, or ſome miniſterial paricide, can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us; but if they were (and they really were)
rejected with contempt by all, what pretence, what
effrontery have the tools and ſycophants of power,
to inſult the underſtandings of mankind with
ſounds? What hopes (for ſuch the General talks
of) could America ever entertain of ſuch an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
ſuch a Parliament, and ſuch a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign?
She has, alas! been driven to deſpair by
all; nay, her ſupplications have been finally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
by thoſe divine effects of patience and
lenity—Famine and the ſword. Thus have thoſe
who are entruſted (as the General ſays) with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
rule, manifeſted to all the world, that they
bear not the ſword in vain. Could George the
Third, that mirror of perſeverance, that idol of
an abandoned Miniſtry, preſent the ſword of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
like the old heathen emperor, to the people,
and bid them uſe it for him, or againſt him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his deſerts? If he could, he then bears
not the ſword in vain, but in defiance of heaven
and earth, in defiance of all laws human and
divine; nor can he bear it long.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1058401600:9"/>
But the moſt ſacred rights of the crown and
people of Great Britain (ſays the General) have
been infringed. It is a moſt audacious piece of
military inſolence, after the late act of tyranny
aſſented to by the ſteady Sovereign, to join the
names of crown and people together, as if their
views and intereſt were ſtill, as in truth they ought
to be, the ſame. Blind to its own intereſt, to its
honour, to its eſtabliſhment, to its ſacred engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at the altar, has the crown, whoſe ſole aim
is plainly deſpotic power, conſulted the intereſts of
the people in its diſputes with America? The rights
of the crown and people were ſtipulated anew at
the Revolution. But has the crown kept its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
with the people of America? If not, by whom
have the rights of the people been infringed?—As
to the rights of the crown, as ſtipulated at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
they are well known, and have been reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
ſubmitted to both at home and abroad,
even in rebellious America; but when it begins to
ſtretch out the arm of uſurpation, it is time that
its deſpotic ſinews ſhould be ſhrunk.</p>
            <p>That the Americans have been guilty (and
bravely guilty) of premeditation and conſpiracy is
moſt true. They have been provoked to action,
and they were too wiſe to act without thinking.
They have moſt virtuouſly conſpired againſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
and diſdained to wear the chains of the moſt
pious King, the wiſeſt Adminiſtration, and moſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1058401600:10"/>
incorrupt Parliament that Great Britain ever
knew.—For theſe demerits the fulneſs of chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is threatened. But ſuppoſe the chaſtiſers
ſhould be chaſtiſed? I have always underſtood
that true courage was ever accompanied by the
greateſt modeſty. Hiſtory is full of theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
But our Miniſtry (like their Sandwich and
their Denbigh) have idly thought that America may
be ſubdued by gaſconade. Such corrupt wretches
are ſtrangers to the great effects of virtue. Sad
experience will inform them ſoon that all human
ſouls are not as abject as their own.</p>
            <p>The Americans are next accuſed of an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
revolt. If by this expreſſion is meant a revolt
againſt their natural allegiance, I anſwer, that
when protection is firſt unjuſtly withdrawn on the
Sovereign's part, all allegiance ceaſes on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject's.
The ſubject muſt then recur to the rights
of nature; reſiſtance may enſue, but no revolt;
for the Sovereign, by breaking his compact, has
ſet the ſubject free. A politician would reaſon
thus; but a ſoldier has no idea of any mode of
government but by the ſword.—We are then told
that our coloniſts dared not truſt their cauſe to the
impartial judgment of the public, or even to the
diſpaſſionate reflection of their followers.—But
with what truth? Were not the General Congreſſes
throughout the continent of America ſo many open
appeals to the judgment of an impartial public?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1058401600:11"/>
Were not the flagitious prints, the popular ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues,
the declamation from the pulpits (which
the General complains of) ſo many incitements to
the cool, diſpaſſionate reflection of their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
Indeed, General, you ſhould always reaſon
ſword in hand. The pen is not your fort. You
are loſt upon paper, and muſt at laſt ſubmit to be
vanquiſhed in the field. Putnam is in earneſt.</p>
            <p>The poor Americans are charged in the next
place with a ſuppreſſion of truth; with obſtructing
every appeal to the real intereſt of the people;
with the groſſeſt forgeries, calumnies, and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.
To ſay that the Americans have been
guilty of ſuppreſſing truth, forging falſehoods,
venting calumnies, and impoſing abſurdities upon
their party, is but a kind of petulant recrimination.
Theſe diſhonourable proceedings, if true, are but
the common ſtratagems of war. They are not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to one ſide only, for the King's party has
practiſed them; all the inſidious ſpies of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
have practiſed them; General Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
has practiſed them moſt baſely; you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
General Gage, have practiſed them as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourably;
but after all, is this malicious
ſplenetic recrimination a proof of treaſon and
rebellion againſt theſe injured people? In ſpite
of all this foul language, the world will think
that there is as much veracity, virtue, candour,
honour, and true courage on the part of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1058401600:12"/>
who defend, as on the part of tyrants who
invade their liberties. I now wiſh to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of theſe appeals which have been made
(if the General ſays true) to the real intereſt of
America.</p>
            <p>Through what channels have they paſſed? Have
either of the three great eſtates of this kingdom,
or has the Miniſter, or even a ſingle tool or lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey
of Adminiſtration, has a North, a Sandwich,
or a Denbigh, once condeſcended to adviſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh,
or expoſtulate with America? Has the
Secretary of State for that department ever had
orders to write in ſuch a ſtrain? Have not all
Lord Bute's ſervile clan endeavoured, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
to carry every thing with a high hand, and
a menacing audacious front? Have they not ſhut
their eyes, ears and hearts, againſt every humble
approach, every filial interceſſion of America?
Theſe inſolent invaders of royal charters, human
rights, and eſtabliſhed laws, have been too much
ſluſhed with the hopes of conqueſt, to wiſh cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially
for a reconciliation with America. They
have induſtriouſly ſtopped up every opening to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it. The mouths of our patriots and our
citizens have been ſtopped by corrupt votes and
majeſtic inſults; as to the propoſal made by Lord
North in his Houſe of Commons, it was calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
for the contempt it met with. His Lordſhip
was not quite fool enough to think it could take
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1058401600:13"/>
place. By whom then has any appeal to the real
intereſt of America been made by thoſe who would
exterminate the people?</p>
            <p>The proſtitution of the preſs makes the next
item in the General's catalogue of complaints. If
the American preſs has been proſtituted, I pray
that Doctor Johnſon may be called upon to declare,
upon the honour of a court-penſioner, how glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
the Engliſh preſs has been employed in the
cauſe of truth by his brother Garreteers; even the
eloquence of the laity and clergy has been exerted
(ſays the General) to excite and juſtify devaſtation
and maſſacre. Can a ſoldier, who ſhould be a
man of honour, aſſert ſo groſs a falſehood? It is
notorious that no one popular harangue, as the
General calls them, has been made in America,
with any other view than that of animating their
gallant countrymen to a juſt defence of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
properties, and lives; the nobleſt purpoſe of
which the diſtinguiſhed gift of the ſpeech can ſerve.
That the brave and virtuous Americans have
animated each other in ſupport of their national
rights, will be recorded in hiſtory to their immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
honour; that our perfidious government has
armed the Papiſts, whom they patronize at Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec,
with a view of deſtroying their Proteſtant
ſubjects, is a circumſtance which will make a
figure of a different caſt in hiſtory, and will moſt
aſſuredly bring the adviſers of that meaſure to an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1058401600:14"/>
ignominious death, in ſpite of the ſtanding army
employed and paid at preſent for no other purpoſe
than that of protecting tyrants; whether popular
harangues made in one caſe, or arms ſupplied in
the other, is moſt characteriſtic of national honour
and virtue, may eaſily be determined. And to
this the baſe, the cowardly, the traiterous deſign of
government, after all the parade and military bluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
of ſurrendering Canada to the French, a vaſt
province acquired laſt war, at the expence of ſo
much blood and treaſure. This puſillanimous
thought has been ſuggeſted to gratify a deſpairing
tyrant. I now accompany the General to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he gives of the 19th of April laſt, reſpecting
an attack upon the King's troops from behind
walls, and lurking holes. Be it ſo; yet who can
believe that the King's troops ſhould have been
unprepared for ambuſcade, or any acts of hoſtile
frenzy, as the General calls it? Have not the
Americans been driven to this frenzy? Is it not
common for an enemy to take every advantage?
Is it not uncommon, nay impoſſible, that troops,
charged with vengeance, ſhould be unprepared to
take it? They could not be unprepared for taking
it, if they were armed; nor would they decline
taking it, if they were Scotchmen. Their not
taking it, therefore, muſt be owing either to a want
of ſpirit or want of conduct, or a want of power.
Since that period (of the 19th of April) ſays the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1058401600:15"/>
General, the rebels have derived confidence from
impunity.—Is it a matter of merit then, with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
ſoldiery, that they did not execute what
they were unable to effect? This is talking like a
driveller, General! But theſe rebels, theſe traiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Revolutioniſts in America, have dared to fire
upon the King's ſhips and ſubjects—Granted—but
have not theſe ſhips invaded them, have not theſe
ſubjects (why did you not ſay ſoldiers and marines)
threatened their deſtruction? Is the doctrine of
paſſive obedience, and non-reſiſtance to the divine
will of tyrants, to be obſerved by the inſulted and
enſlaved Americans, till they felt their Sovereign's
bayonet in their boſoms?—Theſe rebels have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
even farther; they have affected (ſays our
General) to hold the King's army beſieged—Have
they? May heavens proſper ſuch a glorious piece
of affectation! Every conſtitutionaliſt throughout
the Britiſh empire hopes they will not only affect
it, but effect it: every true born Briton longs to
ſee the final triumph of America marked as an
epocha in the future annals of his country; nor
would their joy be checked by the appearance of
another bleſſed martyrdom in the calendar. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and martyrdom, like repreſentation and tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
ſhould go together.</p>
            <p>The charge of invaſion upon private property,
and a wantonneſs of cruelty, is not only indecent,
but imprudent, from that mouth which commands
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1058401600:16"/>
the King's banditti in America, who have ſo dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
themſelves invaded the liberties, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the laws and lives of a free people with the
ſword, merely becauſe they claim, and will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
the rights of Engliſhmen.</p>
            <p>As to the actions of the nineteenth of April laſt,
which ſo often haunt the General's mind, they
ought to ſtand for ever recorded in the calendar,
to the eternal honour of America, who that day
not only totally diſappointed, but bravely reſiſted
no conſiderable party of the King's military aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins.
If any improprieties were committed on that
nineteenth of April by the American troops, which
cannot eaſily be pardoned by ſo conſummate a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
as General Gage; yet their gallant behaviour
on the ſeventeenth of June following muſt ſurely
have deſerved his admiration. They did not fire
then from behind walls and lurking holes, but
bravely faced, attacked and defeated the tyrant's
forces. This appears ſufficiently, even from the
letter which has been artfully impoſed on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
for General Gage's genuine account of that
action; but let the Miniſter ſhew forth the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's
real letter, if he dares. His maſter loſt his
colour when he read it; and I verily believe that
even Lord North (the oſtenſible Miniſter) is not
himſelf entruſted with the true contents of it. His
Lordſhip is but the drudge. He has the name
without the confidence of a Miniſter, and meanly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1058401600:17"/>
ſubmits to be reſponſible for iniquities not his own
The real genuine letter (ſo dreadful are its tidings)
is a ſecret to all but the tyrant, and his gemini,
the Caſtor and Pollux of his cabinet, Bute and
Mansfield. They dare not publiſh it.</p>
            <p>I am now come to the laſt effort within the
bounds of the General's duty, to ſpare the effuſion
of blood, which he is ſtrictly charged to ſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mercy or reluctance. The General, according
to his orders, moſt dutifully diſpatched his bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Colonel Smith to commence the intended car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.
This bully failed; yet blood was unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and unjuſtifiably drawn by our hireling cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats
at Concord; and then the General, in
commiſeration of the calamities which his murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
army had occaſioned, moſt humanely offers,
two months afterwards (when he found himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
to the taſk of conqueſt) his Majeſty's moſt
gracious pardon to theſe unhappy ſufferers. Your
treacherous offer is diſdained—away with it!—
and maſſacre (if you can) but without an inſult,
the braveſt men in the Britiſh empire. Did not
the anceſtors of theſe brave ſpirits ſpurn the inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
proclamation of that tyrant Charles, and
ſhall their ſons fall a prey to the deluſive orders
of a weaker tyrant, and a more conſummate hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite?
—Will not the gallant Adams, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
Hancock fall with their country, if it is her
fate to fall? Or ſhould they be unfortunately taken
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1058401600:18"/>
priſoners, will they not caſt an indignant ſmile
upon the wretch who ſhould affect to pardon them,
after he had enſlaved their country? The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
all America (except the King's Roman
Catholic ſubjects, and good allies at Quebec)
traitors, is but a contemptible echo of that act of
parliament which declared them ſo long ſince, for
conſulting and preparing only againſt an intended
maſſacre by ſword and famine.—America deſpiſes
your threats, your clemency, and all naval and
military terror and parade, thou impotent tyrant!
This General concludes his gaſconade with a moſt
notorious falſehood, by aſſerting that the preſent
unnatural rebellion of the Americans (as he calls
it) has ſtopped the adminiſtration of juſtice in that
country.—For ſhame, for ſhame, General! A
ſoldier, and guilty of a lye (—Your maſter knows,
you know, the whole world knows, that the rotten
Parliament of this nation not only ſtopped the
courſe, but extinguiſhed every benefit of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
law (the ſubjects great inheritance) when they
dared take away the privilege of juries. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was baſe, atrocious, glaring, perfidious, and
tyrannical; but why does this unthinking tool of
military power call the royal charter of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
to his aid; that charter, which his maſter
and his parliamentary junto has ſo groſsly violated?
Is that charter unfavourable to freedom, and can
it now ſerve the cauſe of ſlavery? Has it hitherto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1058401600:19"/>
been ſlighted, and is it now made uſe of to betray
the people for whoſe protection it was granted?
Has it been ſo often diſallowed, with an indignant
ſneer, when America petitioned for redreſs, and is
it now ſet up againſt her by the ſhallow tools of
power, when ſhe is defending thoſe rights and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which it gives her? Is this royal charter now
called in aid of deſpotic meaſures, through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
inſolence, or inadvertency? Why, General!
General! Your haughty unrelenting maſter tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
on the royal charters of his wiſer predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>I tell thee, Homicide, that the faith of Kings
is now no more. Our very laws muſt ſhortly
truckle to the ſword. The law martial which you
have juſt proclaimed, and of which you may ſhortly
taſte yourſelf, will, if you ſucceed in America,
be at length the only law of England. Mansfield
is an advocate for ſummary proceedings.</p>
            <p>The die is caſt in the great divan (the wiſe
council of this nation) and thoſe who would RISE
AGAIN to the STATE and LIBERTIES of
ENGLISHMEN muſt RISE through BLOOD.
The parricides of this conſtitution, General, are
to be found in England, NOT IN AMERICA,
nor can HAPPINESS, PEACE, LIBERTY,
and LAW, be now reſtored (unleſs Providence
miraculouſly intervenes) but by ANOTHER
REVOLUTION.</p>

that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows
how to ſet a proper price upon its goods; and it
would be ſtrange, indeed, if ſo celeſtial an article
as freedom ſhould not be highly rated. Britain,
with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared
that ſhe has a right, not only to tax, but "to bind
us in all caſes whatſoever:" and if being bound in

Whether the independence of the continent was
declared too ſoon, or delayed too long, I will not
now enter into as an argument: my own ſimple
opinion is, that had it been eight months earlier,
it would have been much better. We did not
make a proper uſe of laſt winter; neither could
we, while we were in a dependent ſituation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the fault, if it were one, was all our own:
we have none to blame but ourſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">The preſent winter is worth an age, if rightly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but if loſt, or neglected, the whole continent will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the evil: and there is no puniſhment that man does not deſerve, be he who, or what, or where he will, that may be the means of ſacrificing a ſeaſon ſo precious and uſeful.</note>. But no
great deal is loſt yet: all that Howe has been doing
for this month paſt, is rather a ravage than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
which the ſpirit of the Jerſeys a year ago,
would have quickly repulſed, and which time and
a little reſolution will ſoon recover.</p>
            <p>I have as little ſuperſtition in me as any man
living: but my ſecret opinion has ever been, and
ſtill is, that God will not give up a people to mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
deſtruction, or leave them unſupportedly to
periſh, who had ſo earneſtly and ſo repeatedly
ſought to avoid the calamities of war, by every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
method which wiſdom could invent. Neither
have I ſo much of the infidel in me, as to ſuppoſe
that he has relinquiſhed the government of the
world, and given us up to the care of devils: and
as I do not, I cannot ſee on what grounds the king
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1058401600:22"/>
can look up to heaven for help againſt us. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
murderer, a highwayman, or a houſebreaker,
has as good a pretence as he.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſurpriſing to ſee how rapidly a panic will
ſometimes run through a country. All nations and
ages have been ſubject to them. Britain has trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
like an ague, at the report of a French fleet of
flat-bottomed boats: and in the fourteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
the whole Engliſh army, after ravaging the
kingdom of France, was driven back, like men
petrified with fear: and this brave exploit was
performed by a few broken forces, collected and
headed by a woman, Joan of Arc. Would that
heaven might inſpire ſome Jerſey maid to ſpirit up
her countrymen, and ſave her fair fellow ſufferers
from ravage and raviſhment! Yet panics, in ſome
caſes, have their uſes: they produce as much good
as hurt. Their duration is always ſhort: the mind
ſoon grows through them, and acquires a firmer
habit than before. But their peculiar advantage
is, that they are the touchſtones of ſincerity and
hypocriſy, and bring things and men to light,
which might otherwiſe have lain for ever undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
In fact, they have the ſame effect upon
ſecret traitors, which an imaginary apparition would
upon a private murderer. They ſift out the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
thoughts of man, and hold them up in public
to the world. Many a diſguiſed tory has lately
ſhown his head, that ſhall penitentially ſolemnize
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1058401600:23"/>
with curſes the day on which Howe arrived upon
the Delaware.</p>
            <p>As I was with the troops at Fort Lee, and
marched with them to the edge of Pennſylvania, I
am well acquainted with many circumſtances, which
thoſe, who lived at a diſtance, know but little
or nothing of. Our ſituation there was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
cramped, the place being on a narrow neck
of land, between the North river and the Hackin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack.
Our force was inconſiderable, being not one
fourth ſo great as Howe could bring againſt us. We
had no army at hand to have relieved the garriſon,
had we ſhut ourſelves up, and ſtood on the defence.
Our ammunition, light artillery, and the beſt part
of our ſtores, had been removed, upon the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
that Howe would endeavour to penetrate
the Jerſeys, in which caſe Fort Lee could have been
of no uſe to us: for it muſt occur to every think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man, whether in the army or not, that theſe kinds
of field-forts are only fit for temporary purpoſes,
and laſt in uſe no longer than the enemy directs
his force againſt the particular object which ſuch
forts were raiſed to defend. Such was our ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and condition at Fort Lee, on the morning
of the twentieth of November, when an officer
arrived with information, that the enemy, with two
hundred boats, had landed about ſeven or eight
miles above. Major-general Green, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the garriſon, immediately ordered them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1058401600:24"/>
under arms, and ſent expreſs to his Excellency
General Waſhington, at the town of Hackinſack,
diſtant, by way of the ferry, ſix miles. Our firſt
object was to ſecure the bridge over the Hackin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack,
which lay up the river, between the enemy
and us, about ſix miles from us, and three from
them. General Waſhington arrived in about three
quarters of an hour, and marched at the head of
the troops to the bridge, which place I expected
we ſhould have a bruſh for: however, they did
not chooſe to diſpute it with us: and the greateſt
part of our troops went over the bridge, the reſt
over the ferry, except ſome which paſſed at a mill,
on a ſmall creek, between the bridge and the ferry,
and made their way through ſome marſhy grounds,
up to the town of Hackinſack, and there paſſed the
river. We brought off as much baggage as the
waggons could contain: the reſt was loſt. The
ſimple object was to bring off the garriſon, and to
march them on till they could be ſtrengthened by
the Jerſey or Pennſylvania militia, ſo as to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to make a ſtand. We ſtaid four days at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark,
collected in our out-poſts, with ſome of the
Jerſey militia, and marched out twice to meet the
enemy, on information of their being advancing,
though our numbers were greatly inferior to theirs.
General Howe, in my opinion, committed a great
error in generalſhip, in not throwing a body of ſorces
off from Staten Iſland through Amboy, by which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1058401600:25"/>
means he might have ſeized all our ſtores at Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,
and intercepted our march into Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.
But if we believe the power of hell to be
limited, we muſt likewiſe believe that their agents
are under ſome providential controul.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not now attempt to give all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of our retreat to the Delaware. Suffice it for
the preſent to ſay, that both officers and men,
though greatly harraſſed and fatigued, frequently
without reſt, covering, or proviſion, the inevitable
conſequences of a long retreat, bore it with a
manly and a martial ſpirit. All their wiſhes were
one; which was, that the country would turn out,
and help them to drive the enemy back. Voltaire
has remarked, that king William never appeared to
full advantage, but in difficulties and in action.
The ſame remark may be made on General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,
for the character fits him. There is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
firmneſs in ſome minds, which cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked
by trifles; but which, when unlocked, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
a cabinet of fortitude: and I reckon it
among thoſe kind of public bleſſings which we do
not immediately ſee, that God hath bleſſed him
with uninterrupted health, and given him a mind
that can even flouriſh upon care.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this paper with ſome miſcella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
remarks on the ſtate of our affairs; and ſhall
begin with aſking the following queſtion: Why
is it that the enemy hath left the New England pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1058401600:26"/>
and made theſe middle ones the ſeat of
war? The anſwer is eaſy: New England is not
infeſted with Tories, and we are. I have been
tender in raiſing the cry againſt theſe men, and uſed
numberleſs arguments to ſhow them their danger:
but it will not do to ſacrifice a world to either their
folly or their baſeneſs. The period is now arrived,
in which either they or we muſt change our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
or one or both muſt fall. And what is
a tory? Good God! what is he? I ſhould not be
afraid to go with an hundred Whigs againſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Tories, were they to attempt to get into arms.
Every Tory is a coward; for a ſervile, ſlaviſh,
ſelf-intereſted fear is the foundation of toryiſm;
and a man under ſuch influence, though he may be
cruel, never can be brave.</p>
            <p>But before the line of irrecoverable ſeparation
may be drawn between us, let us reaſon the matter
together: your conduct is an invitation to the
enemy; yet not one in a thouſand of you has heart
enough to join him. Howe is as much deceived
by you, as the American cauſe is injured by you.
He expects you will all take up arms, and flock to
his ſtandard with muſkets on your ſhoulders. Your
opinions are of no uſe to him, unleſs you ſupport
him perſonally; for it is ſoldiers, and not tories,
that he wants.</p>
            <p>I once felt all that kind of anger, which a man
ought to feel, againſt the mean principles that are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1058401600:27"/>
held by the Tories. A noted one, who kept a
tavern at Amboy, was ſtanding at his door, with
as pretty a child in his hand, about eight or nine
years old, as moſt I ever ſaw; and after ſpeaking
his mind as freely as he thought was prudent, finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this unfatherly expreſſion, "Well, give
me peace in my days." Not a man lives on the
continent, but fully believes that ſeparation muſt
ſome time or other finally take place, and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
parent would have ſaid, "if there muſt be
trouble, let it be in my days, that my child may
have peace;" and this ſingle reflection, well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
is ſufficient to awaken every man to duty.
Not a place upon earth might be ſo happy as Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.
Her ſituation is remote from all the wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
world, and ſhe has nothing to do but to trade
with them. A man may eaſily diſtinguiſh in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
between temper and principle, and I am as
confident as I am that God governs the world, that
America will never be happy till ſhe gets clear of
foreign dominion. Wars, without ceaſing, will
break out till that period arrives, and the continent
muſt, in the end be conqueror; for, though the
flame of liberty may ſometimes ceaſe to ſhine, the
coal never can expire.</p>
            <p>America did not, nor does not want force; but
ſhe wanted a proper application of that force.
Wiſdom is not the purchaſe of a day and it is no
wonder we ſhould on at firſt ſetting off. From an
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1058401600:28"/>
exceſs of tenderneſs, we were unwilling to raiſe
an army, and truſted our cauſe to the temporary
defence of a well meaning militia. A ſummer's
experience has now taught us better; yet with thoſe
troops, while they were collected, we were able to
ſet bounds to the progreſs of the enemy; and,
thank God! they are again aſſembling. I always
conſidered a militia as the beſt troops in the world
for a ſudden exertion, but they will not do for a long
campaign. Howe, it is probable, will make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
on this city; ſhould he fail on this ſide the
Delaware, he is ruined; if he ſucceeds, our cauſe
is not ruined. He ſtakes all on his ſide againſt a
part on ours; admitting he ſucceeds, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
will be, that armies from both ends of the
continent will march to aſſiſt their ſuffering friends
in the middle ſtates; for he cannot go every where:
it is impoſſible. I conſider Howe as the greateſt
enemy the tories have; he is bringing a war into
their own country, which, had it not been for him
and partly for themſelves, they had been clear of.
Should he now be expelled, I wiſh, with all the
devotion of a chriſtian, that the names of whig and
tory may never more be mentioned; but ſhould the
tories give him encouragement to come, or aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
if he come, I as ſincerely wiſh that our next
year's arms may expel them from the continent,
and the congreſs appropriate their poſſeſſions to
the relief of thoſe who have ſuffered in well-doing.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1058401600:29"/>
A ſingle ſucceſsful battle next year will ſettle the
whole. America will carry on a two-years war by
the confiſcation of the property of diſaffected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and be made happy by their expulſion. Say
not that this is revenge: call it rather the ſoft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
of a ſuffering people, who, having no
object in view but the good of all, have ſtaked
their own all upon a ſeemingly doubtful event.
Yet it is folly to argue againſt determined hardneſs:
eloquence may ſtrike the car, and the language of
ſorrow draw forth the tear of compaſſion, but
nothing can reach the heart that is ſteeled with
prejudice.</p>
            <p>Quitting this claſs of men, I turn, with the
warm ardour of a friend, to thoſe who have nobly
ſtood, and are yet determined to ſtand the matter
out. I call not upon a few, but upon all; not on
this ſtate, or that ſtate, but on every ſtate. Up
and help us. Lay your ſhoulders to the wheel.
Better have too much force than too little, when
ſo great an object is at ſtake. Let it be told to the
future world, that in the depth of winter, when
nothing but hope and virtue could ſurvive, that
the city and the country, alarmed at one common
danger, came forth to meet and to repulſe it. Say
not that thouſands are gone: turn out your tens of
thouſands: throw not the burden of the day upon
providence, but ſhow your faith by your good
works, that God may bleſs you. It matters not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1058401600:30"/>
where you live, or what rank of life you hold; the
evil or the bleſſing will reach you all. The far
and the near, the home counties and the back,
the rich and the poor, ſhall ſuffer or rejoice alike.
The heart that feels not now, is dead. The blood
of his children ſhall curſe his cowardice, who
ſhrinks back at a time when a little might have
ſaved the whole and made them happy. I love
the man that can ſmile in trouble—that can gather
ſtrength from diſtreſs, and grow brave by reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It is the buſineſs of little minds to ſhrink;
but he, whoſe heart is firm, and whoſe conſcience
approves his conduct, will purſue his principles
unto death. My own line of reaſoning is to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as ſtrait and clear as a ray of light. Not all
the treaſures of the world, ſo far as I believe,
could have induced me to ſupport an offenſive
war; for I think it murder: but if a thief break
into my houſe—burn and deſtroy my property,
and kill, or threaten to kill me and thoſe that are in
it, and to "bind me in all caſes whatſoever," to his
abſolute will, am I to ſuffer it? What ſignifies it
to me, whether he who does it, is a king or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
man; my countryman, or not my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
whether it is done by an individual villain,
or an army of them? If we reaſon to the root of
things we ſhall find no difference; neither can any
juſt cauſe be aſſigned, why we ſhould puniſh in the
one caſe and pardon in the other. Let them call
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1058401600:31"/>
me rebel, and welcome; I feel no concern from it;
but I ſhould ſuffer the miſery of devils, were
I to make a whore of my ſoul, by ſwearing allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to one whoſe character is that of a ſottiſh,
ſtupid, ſtubborn, worthleſs, brutiſh man. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
likewiſe, a horrid idea in receiving mercy
from a being, who at the laſt day, ſhall be ſhriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the rocks and mountains to cover him, and
fleeing with terror from the orphan, the widow, and
the ſlain of America.</p>
            <p>There are caſes which cannot be overdone by
language; and this is one. There are perſons too,
who ſee not the full extent of the evil that threatens
them. They ſolace themſelves with hopes, that
the enemy, if they ſucceed, will be merciful. It
is the madneſs of folly, to expect mercy from thoſe
who have refuſed to do juſtice: and even mercy,
where conqueſt is the object, is only a trick of
war. The cunning of the fox is as murderous as
the violence of the wolf, and we ought to be
equally on our guard againſt both. Howe's firſt
object is partly by threats, and partly by promiſes,
to terrify or ſeduce the people to give up thei
arms, and receive mercy. The miniſtry recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the ſame plan to Gage: and this is what
the tories call making their peace—"a peace
which paſſeth all underſtanding," indeed. A
peace which would be the immediate forerunner o
a worſe ruin than any we have yet thought of. Ye
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1058401600:32"/>
men of Pennſylvania, do reaſon upon thoſe things!
Were the back counties to give up their arms, they
would fall an eaſy prey to the Indians, who are
all armed. This, perhaps, is what ſome tories
would not be ſorry for. Were the home counties
to deliver up their arms, they would be expoſed
to the reſentment of the back counties, who would
then have it in their power to chaſtiſe their defection
at pleaſure. And were any one ſtate to give up
its arms, that ſtate muſt be garriſoned by all Howe's
army of Britons and Heſſians, to preſerve it from
the anger of the reſt. Mutual fear is a principal
link in the chain of mutual love, and woe be to
that ſtate that breaks the compact. Howe is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
inviting you to a barbarous deſtruction, and
men muſt be either rogues or fools that will not ſee
it. I dwell not upon the vapours of imagination,
I bring reaſon to your ears; and in language as
plain as A, B, C, hold up truth to your eyes.</p>
            <p>I thank God, that I fear not. I ſee no real
cauſe for fear. I know our ſituation well, and can
ſee the way out of it. While our army was col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
Howe dared not riſk a battle: and it is no
credit to him, that he decamped from the White
Plains, and waited a mean opportunity to ravage
the defenceleſs Jerſeys: but it is great credit to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that, with an handful of men, we ſuſtained an
orderly retreat for near an hundred miles, brought
off our ammunition, all our field pieces, the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1058401600:33"/>
greateſt part of our ſtores, and had four rivers to
paſs. None can ſay, that our retreat was precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for we were near three weeks in performing
it, that the country might have time to come in.
Twice we marched back to meet the enemy, and
remained out till dark. The ſign of fear was not
ſeen in our camp: and had not ſome of the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
and diſaffected inhabitants ſpread falſe alarms
through the country, the Jerſeys had never been
ravaged. Once more, we are again collected and
collecting. Our new army, at both ends of the
continent, is recruiting faſt; and we ſhall be able
to open the next campaign with ſixty thouſand men,
well armed and cloathed. This is our ſituation—
and who will, may know it. By perſeverance
and fortitude, we have the proſpect of a glorious
iſſue; by cowardice and ſubmiſſion, the ſad choice
of a variety of evils—a ravaged country—a depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated
city—habitations without ſafety—and
ſlavery without hope—our homes turned into bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks
and bawdy-houſes for Heſſians—and a future
race to provide for, whoſe fathers we ſhall doubt
of! Look on this picture, and weep over it! and if
there yet remains one thoughtleſs wretch, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
it not, let him ſuffer it unlamented.</p>

            <p>UNIVERSAL empire is the prerogative of a
writer. His concerns are with all mankind, and
though he cannot command their obedience, he
can aſſign them their duty. The republic of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is more ancient than monarchy, and of far
higher character in the world than the vaſſal court
of Britain; he that rebels againſt reaſon is a real
rebel, but he that in defence of reaſon, rebels
againſt tyranny, has a better title to "defender
of the faith" than George the third.</p>
            <p>As a military man, your lordſhip may hold out
the ſword of war, and call it the <hi>"ultima ratio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi>;"
the laſt reaſon of kings; we in return can
ſhew you the ſword of juſtice, and call it, "the
beſt ſcourge of tyrants." The firſt of theſe two
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1058401600:35"/>
may threaten, or even frighten, for a while, and
caſt a ſickly langour over an inſulted people, but
reaſon will ſoon recover the debauch, and reſtore
them again to tranquil fortitude. Your Lordſhip,
I find, has now commenced author, and publiſhed
a Proclamation; I too have publiſhed a Criſis;
as they ſtand, they are the antipodes of each other;
both cannot riſe at once, and one of them muſt
deſcend: and ſo quick is the revolution of things,
that your Lordſhip's performance, I ſee, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
fallen many degrees from its firſt place, and
is now juſt viſible on the edge of the political ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</p>
            <p>It is ſurpriſing to what a pitch of infatuation blind
folly and obſtinacy will carry mankind, and your
Lordſhip's drowſy Proclamation is a proof that it
does not even quit them in their ſleep. Perhaps
you thought America too was taking a nap, and
therefore choſe, like Satan to Eve, to whiſper the
deluſion ſoftly, leſt you ſhould awaken her. This
continent, Sir, is too extenſive to ſleep all at
once, and too watchful, even in its ſlumbers, not
to ſtartle at the unhallowed foot of an invader.
You may iſſue your proclamations, and welcome,
for we have learned to "reverence ourſelves,"
and ſcorn the inſulting ruffian that employs you.
America, for your deceaſed brother's ſake, would
gladly have ſhewn you reſpect, and it is a new
aggravation to her ſeelings, that Howe ſhould be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1058401600:36"/>
forgetful, and raiſe his ſword againſt thoſe, who at
their own charge raiſed a monument to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But your maſter has commanded, and you
have not enough of nature left to refuſe. Surely
there muſt be ſomething ſtrangely degenerating in
the love of monarchy, that can ſo completely wear
a man down to an ingrate, and make him proud to
lick the duſt that kings have trode upon. A few
more years, ſhould you ſurvive them, will beſtow
on you the title of an old man, and in ſome hour
of future reflection you may probably find the
fitneſs of Wolſey's deſpairing penitence, "Had
I ſerved my God as faithfully as I have ſerved
my king, he would not thus have forſaken me
in my old age."</p>
            <p>The character you appear to us in is truly ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.
Your friends, the tories, announced your
coming with high deſcriptions of your unlimited
powers; but your Proclamation has given them
the lie, by ſhewing you to be a commiſſioner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
authority. Had your powers been ever ſo
great, they were nothing to us, farther than we
pleaſed; becauſe we had the ſame right which
other nations had, to do what we thought was
beſt. "The United States of America," will
found as pompouſly in the world, or in hiſtory, as
"the Kingdom of Great Britain;" the character of
General Waſhington will fill a page with as much
luſtre as that of Lord Howe; and the congreſs
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1058401600:37"/>
have as much right to command the king and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of London to deſiſt from legiſlation, as
they or you have to command the congreſs. Only
ſuppoſe how laughable ſuch an edict would appear
from us, and then, in that merry mood, do but
turn the tables upon yourſelf, and you will ſee
how your Proclamation is received here. Having
thus placed you in a proper poſition, in which you
may have a full view of folly, and learn to deſpiſe
it, I hold up to you, for that purpoſe, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quotation from your own lunarian Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
"And we (Lord Howe and General Howe)
do command (and in his Majeſty's name for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth),
all ſuch perſons as are aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
under the name of general or provincial
congreſſes, committees, conventions, or other
aſſociations, by whatever name or names known
or diſtinguiſhed, to deſiſt and ceaſe from all
ſuch treaſonable actings and doings."</p>
            <p>You introduce your Proclamation by referring
to your declarations of the 14th of July and 19th
of September. In the laſt of theſe, you ſunk
yourſelf below the character of a private gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
That I may not ſeem to accuſe you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly,
I ſhall ſtate the circumſtance: By a verbal
invitation of yours, communicated to congreſs by
General Sullivan, then a priſoner on his parole,
you ſignified your deſire of conferring with ſome
members of that body as private gentlemen. It
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1058401600:38"/>
was beneath the dignity of the American congreſs
to pay any regard to a meſſage that at beſt was
but a genteel affront, and had too much of the
miniſterial complexion of tampering with private
perſons; and which might probably have been the
caſe, had the gentlemen, who were deputed on that
buſineſs, poſſeſſed that eaſy kind of virtue which
an Engliſh courtier is ſo truly diſtinguiſhed by.
Your requeſt, however, was complied with, for
honeſt men are naturally more tender of their civil
than their political fame. The interview ended
as every sensible man thought it would; for your
Lordſhip knows, as well as the writer of the Criſis,
that it is impossible for the King of England to
promiſe the repeal, or even the reviſal, of any
acts of parliament; wherefore, on your part you
had nothing to ſay, more than to requeſt, in the
room of demanding the entire ſurrender of the
continent; and then, if that was complied with,
to promise the that the inhabitants ſhould eſcape with
their lives. This was the upſhot of the conference.
You informed the conferees that you were two
months in ſoliciting theſe powers. We aſk, what
powers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, as commiſſioner, you have none. If
you mean the power of pardoning, it is an oblique
proof, that your maſter was determined to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
all before him; and that you were two months
in diſſuading him from his purpoſe. Another evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his ſavage obſtinacy! From your own
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1058401600:39"/>
account of the matter, we may juſtly draw theſe
two concluſions: firſt, that you ſerve a monſter;
and ſecondly, that never was a commiſſioner ſent
on a more fooliſh errand than yourſelf. This
plain language may perhaps ſound uncoothly to an
ear vitiated by courtly reſinements; but words
were made for uſe, and the fault lies in deſerving
them, or the abuſe in applying them unfairly.</p>
            <p>Soon after your return to New-York, you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
a very illiberal and unmanly hand bill againſt
the congreſs; for it was certainly ſtepping out of
the line of common civility, firſt to ſcreen your
national pride by ſoliciting an interview with them
as private gentlemen, and in the concluſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to deceive the multitude by making an
hand-bill attack on the whole body of the congreſs;
you got them together under one name, and abuſed
them under another. But the king you ſerve, and
the cauſe you ſupport, afford you ſo few inſtances
of acting the gentleman, that out of pity to your
ſituation, the congreſs pardoned the inſult by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no notice of it.</p>
            <p>You ſay in that hand-bill, "that they, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
diſavowed every purpoſe for reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not conſonant with their extravagant and
inadmiſſible claim of independence."</p>
            <p>Why, God bleſs me! what have you to do with
our independence? we aſked no leave of yours to
ſet it up; we aſk no money of yours to ſupport it;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1058401600:40"/>
we can do better without your fleets and armies
than with them; you may ſoon have enough to do
to protect yourſelves without being burthened with
us. We are very willing to be at peace with you,
to buy of you and ſell to you, and, like young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners
in the world, to work for our own living;
therefore, why do you put yourſelves out of caſh,
when we know you cannot ſpare it, and we do not
deſire you to run into debt? I am willing, Sir,
you ſhould ſee your folly in every view I can
place it, and for that reaſon deſcend ſometimes to
tell you in jeſt what I wiſh you to ſee in earneſt.
But to be more ſerious with you, why do you ſay
"their" independence? To ſet you right, Sir,
we tell you, that the independency is ours, not
theirs. The congreſs were authoriſed, by every
ſtate on the continent, to publiſh it to all the world,
and in ſo doing are not to be conſidered as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors,
but only as the heralds that proclaimed
it, or the office from which the ſenſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
received a legal form; and it was as much as
any or all their heads were worth, to have treated
with you, on the ſubject of ſubmiſſion, under any
name whatever. But we know the men in whom
we have truſted;—can England ſay the ſame of
her parliament?</p>
            <p>I come now more particularly to your Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the 30th of November laſt. Had you
gained an entire conqueſt over all the armies of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1058401600:41"/>
America, and then put forth a proclamation, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
(what you call) mercy, your conduct would
have had ſome ſpacious ſhew of humanity; but to
creep by ſurpriſe into a province, and there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to terrify and ſeduce the inhabitants from
their juſt allegiance to the reſt, by promiſes which
you neither meant nor were able to fulfil, is both
cruel and unmanly: cruel in its effects; becauſe,
unleſs you can keep all the ground you have
marched over, how are you, in the words of your
Proclamation, to ſecure to your proſelytes "the
enjoyment of their property?" What are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
either of your new-adopted ſubjects, or your
old friends the tories, in Burlington, Bordentown,
Trenton, Montholly, and many other places, where
you proudly lorded it for a few days, and then fled
with the precipitation of a purſued thief? What,
I ſay, are to become of thoſe wretches? What
are to become of thoſe who went over to you from
this city and ſtate? What more can you ſay to
them than "ſhift for yourſelves?" Or what more
can they hope for than to wander like vagabonds
over the face of the earth? You may now tell
them to take their leave of America, and all that
once was theirs. Recommend them, for conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to your maſter's court: there perhaps they
may make a ſhift to live on the ſcraps of ſome dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
paraſite, and chuſe companions among thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1058401600:42"/>
like themſelves. A traitor is the fouleſt fiend
on earth.</p>
            <p>In a political ſenſe we ought to thank you for
thus bequeathing eſtates to the continent; we ſhall
ſoon, at this rate, be able to carry on a war with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
expence, and grow rich by the ill policy of
Lord Howe, and the generous defection of the
tories. Had you ſet your foot into this city, you
would have beſtowed eſtates upon us which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought of, by bringing forth traitors we were
unwilling to ſuſpect. "But theſe men" you will
ſay, "are his majeſty's moſt faithful ſubjects;" let
that honour then be all their fortune, and let his
majeſty take them to himſelf.</p>
            <p>I am now thoroughly diſguſted with them; they
live in ungrateful caſe, and bend their whole minds
to miſchief. It ſeems as if God had given them
over to a ſpirit of infidelity, and that they are open
to conviction in no other line but that of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It is time to have done with tarring, feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
carting, and taking ſecurities for their future
good behaviour. Every ſenſible man muſt feel a
conſcious ſhame at ſeeing a poor fellow hawked for
a ſhew about the ſtreets, when it is known, that he is
only the tool of ſome principal villian, blaſſed into
his offence by the force of falſe reaſoning, or bribed
thereto through ſad neceſſity. We diſhonour our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by attacking ſuch trifling characters, while
greater ones are ſuffered to eſcape. 'Tis our duty
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1058401600:43"/>
to find them out, and their proper puniſhment
would be to exile them from the continent for ever.
The circle of them is not ſo great as ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
The influence of a ſew has tainted many
who are not naturally corrupt. A continual circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of lies among thoſe who are not much in the
way of hearing them contradicted, will in time paſs
for truth: and the crime lies not in the believer,
but the inventor. I am not for declaring war
againſt every man that appears not ſo warm as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Difference of conſtitution, temper, habit of
ſpeaking, and many other things, will go a great
way in ſixing the outward character of a man, yet
ſimple honeſty may remain at bottom. Some men
have naturally a military turn, and can brave hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
and the riſk of life, with a chearful face: others
have not; no ſlavery appears to them ſo great as
the fatigue of arms, and no terror ſo powerful as
that of perſonal danger. What can we ſay; We
cannot alter nature; neither ought we to puniſh
the ſon becauſe the father begot him in a cowardly
mood. However, I believe moſt men have more
courage than they know of, and that a little at firſt
is enough to begin with. I knew the time when
I thought that the whiſtling of a cannon ball would
have frightened me almoſt to death: but I have
ſince tried it, and find I can ſtand it with as little
diſcompoſure, and (I believe) with a much eaſier
conſcience than your Lordſhip. The ſame dread
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1058401600:44"/>
would return to me again, were I in your ſituation:
for my ſolemn belief of your cauſe, is, that it is
helliſh and damnable: and under that conviction,
every thinking man's heart muſt fail him.</p>
            <p>From a concern, that a good cauſe ſhould be
diſhonoured by the leaſt diſunion among us, I ſaid
in my former paper, No. II. that, "ſhould the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
now be expelled, I wiſh, with all the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a chriſtian, that the names of whig and
tory might never more be mentioned:" but there
is a knot of men among us, of ſuch a venomous
caſt, that they will not admit even one's good wiſhes
to act in their favour. Inſtead of rejoicing that
heaven had, as it were, providentially preſerved
this city from plunder and deſtruction, by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
ſo great a part of the enemy into our hands,
with ſo little effuſion of blood, they ſtubbornly
affected to diſbelieve it, until within an hour, nay
half an hour of the priſoners arriving: and the
quakers<note n="*" place="bottom">I have ever been careful of charging offences upon whole ſocieties of men, but as the paper referred to is put forth by an unknown fet of men, who claim to themſelves the right of repreſenting the whole; and while the whole ſociety of Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers admit its validity by a ſilent acknowledgment, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any diſtinction can be made by the public; and the more ſo, becauſe the New-York paper, of the 30th of December, printed by permiſſion of our enemies, ſays, that "the Quakers begin to ſpeak openly of their attachment to the Britiſh conſtitution." We are certain that we have many friends among them, and wiſh to know them.</note> put forth a teſtimony, dated the twentieth
of December, ſigned John Pemberton, declaring
their attachment to the Britiſh government. Theſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1058401600:45"/>
men are continually harping on the great ſin of our
bearing arms: but the king of Briton may lay waſte
the world in blood and famine, and they, poor
fallen ſouls, have nothing to ſay.</p>
            <p>In ſome future paper, I intend to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the different kinds of perſons who have been
denominated tories: for this I am clear in, that all
are not ſo, who have been called ſo, nor all men
whigs, who were once thought ſo: and as I mean
not to conceal the name of any true friend, when
there ſhall be occaſion to mention him; neither
will I that of an enemy, who ought to be known,
let his rank, ſtation, or religion be what it may.</p>
            <p>Much pains have been taken by ſome to ſet your
Lordſhip's private character in an amiable light:
but as it has chiefly been done by men who know
nothing about you, and who are no ways remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for their attachment to us, we have no juſt
authority for believing it. George the Third was
impoſed upon us by the ſame arts: but time has
at length done him juſtice: and the ſame fate may
probably attend your Lordſhip. Your avowed
purpoſe here, is, to kill, conquer, plunder, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and enſlave: and the ravages of your army,
through the Jerſeys, have been marked with as
much barbariſm, as if you had openly profeſſed
yourſelf the prince of ruffians. Not even the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of humanity has been preſerved either on
the march or the retreat of your troops. No ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1058401600:46"/>
order, that I could ever learn, has ever been
iſſued to prevent or even forbid your troops from
robbery, wherever they came: and the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of juſtice, if it can be called ſuch, which
has diſtinguiſhed you for impartiality, is, that you
treated and plundered all alike. What could not
be carried away, have been deſtroyed: and maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gany
furniture has been deliberately laid on the fire
for fuel, rather than the men ſhould be fatigued
with cutting wood<note n="*" place="bottom">As ſome people may doubt the truth of ſuch wanton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, I think it neceſſary to inform, that one of the people called Quakers, who lives at Trenton, gave me this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the houſe of Mr. Michael Hutchinſon (one of the ſame profeſſion), who lives near to Trenton ferry, on the Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania ſide, Mr. Hutchinſon being preſent.</note>. There was a time, when the
whigs confided much in your ſuppoſed candour,
and the tories reſted themſelves on your favour.
The experiments have now been made, and failed:
and every town, nay every cottage, in the Jerſeys
where your arms have been, is a teſtimony againſt
you. How you may reſt under this ſacrifice of
character, I know not: but this I know, that you
ſleep and riſe with the daily curſes of thouſands
upon you. Perhaps, the miſery which the tories
have ſuffered by your proffered mercy, may give
them ſome claim to their country's pity, and be in
the end the beſt favour you could ſhew them.</p>
            <p> In a folio general order book belonging to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
Rahl's battalion, taken at Trenton, and now
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1058401600:47"/>
now in the poſſeſſion of the council of ſafety for
this ſtate, the following barbarous order is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
repeated: "His excellency the commander
in chief orders that all inhabitants which ſhall be
found with arms, not having an officer with them,
ſhall be immediately taken and hung up." How
many you may thus have privately ſacrificed, we
know not; and the account can only be ſettled in
another world. Your treatment of priſoners, in
order to diſtreſs them to enliſt into your infernal
ſervice, is not to be equalled by any inſtance in
Europe. Yet this is the humane Lord Howe, and
his brother, whom the tories, and their three-quarter
kindred, the quakers, or ſome of them at leaſt, have
been holden up for patterns of juſtice and mercy!</p>
            <p>A bad cauſe will ever be ſupported by bad means,
and bad men: and whoever will be at the pains of
examining ſtrictly into things, will find that one and
the ſame ſpirit of oppoſition and impiety, more or
leſs, governs through your whole party in both
countries. Not many days ago, I accidentally fell
in company with a perſon of this city, noted for
eſpouſing your cauſe; and on my remarking to him,
that it appeared clear to me, by the late providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
turn of affairs, that God Almighty was viſibly
on our ſide; he replied, we care nothing for that;
you may have him, and welcome; if we have but
enough of the devil on our ſide, we ſhall do.
However careleſsly this be ſpoken, matters not;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1058401600:48"/>
'tis ſtill the inſenſible principle that directs all your
conduct, and will at laſt moſt aſſuredly deceive
and ruin you.</p>
            <p>If ever a nation was mad and fooliſh, blind to
its own intereſt, and bent on its own deſtruction, it
is Britain. There are ſuch things as national ſins:
and though the puniſhment of individuals may be
reſerved to another world, national puniſhment can
only be inflicted in this world. Britain, as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is, in my inmoſt belief, the greateſt and moſt
ungrateful offender againſt God, on the face of the
whole earth. Bleſſed with all the commerce ſhe
could wiſh for, and furniſhed by a vaſt extent of
dominion, with the means of civilizing both the
eaſtern and weſtern world, ſhe has made no other
uſe of both, than proudly to idolize her own
"thunder," and rip up the bowels of whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
for what ſhe could get. Like Alexander,
ſhe has made war her ſport, and inflicted miſery
for prodigality ſake. The blood of India is not
yet repaid, nor the wretchedneſs of Africa yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited.
Of late, ſhe has enlarged her lift of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
cruelties, by her butcherly deſtruction of
the Caribbs of St. Vincent's, and in returning an
anſwer by the ſword, to the meek prayer for "peace,
liberty, and ſafety." Theſe are ſerious things:
and whatever a fooliſh tyrant, a debauched court,
a trafficking legiſlature, or a blinded people, may
think, the national account with heaven muſt ſome
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1058401600:49"/>
day or other be ſettled. All countries have ſooner or
later been called to their reckoning. The proudeſt
empires have ſunk, when the balance was ſtruck:
and Britain, like an individual penitent, muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
her day of ſorrow, and the ſooner it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to her the better. As I wiſh it over, I wiſh
it to come, but withal wiſh that it may be as light
as poſſible.</p>
            <p>Perhaps your Lordſhip has no taſte for ſerious
things. By your connexions in England, I ſhould
ſuppoſe not: therefore I ſhall drop this part of the
ſubject, and take it up in a line in which you
will better underſtand me.</p>
            <p>By what means, may I aſk, do you expect to
conquer America? If you could not effect it in
the ſummer when our army was leſs than yours,
nor in the winter, when we had none, how are
you to do it? In point of generalſhip, you have
been outwitted; and in point of fortitude, outdone:
your advantages turn out to your loſs, and ſhew us
that it is in our power to ruin you by gifts. Like
a game of drafts, we can move out of one ſquare,
to let you come in, in order that we may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
take two or three for one; and as we can
always keep a double corner for ourſelves, we can
always prevent a total defeat. You cannot be ſo
inſenſible, as not to ſee that we have two to one
the advantage of you, becauſe we conquer by a
drawn game, and you loſe by it. Burgoyne might
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1058401600:50"/>
have taught your Lordſhip this knowledge; he has
been long a ſtudent in the doctrine of chances.</p>
            <p>I have no other idea of conquering countries
than by ſubduing the armies which defend them:
have you done this, or can you do this? If you
have not, it would be civil in you to let your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
alone for the preſent; otherwiſe, you
will ruin more tories by your grace and favour than
you will whigs by your arms.</p>
            <p>Were you to obtain poſſeſſion of this city, you
would not know what to do with it, more than to
plunder it. To hold it, in the manner you hold
New York, would be an additional dead weight
upon your hands: and if a general conqueſt is
your object, you had better be without the city
than with it. When you have defeated all our
armies, the cities will fall into your hands of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
but to creep into them in the manner you
got into Princetown, Trenton, &amp;c. is like robbing
an orchard in the night, before the fruit be ripe,
and running away in the morning. Your experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Jerſeys is ſufficient to teach you that
you have ſomething more to do than barely to get
into other people's houſes; and your new converts
to whom you promiſed all manner of protection,
and ſeduced into new guilt by pardoning them
from their former virtues, muſt begin to have a
very contemptible opinion both of your power and
policy. Your authority in the Jerſeys is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1058401600:51"/>
to the ſmall circle which your army occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
and your Proclamation is no where elſe ſeen,
unleſs it be to be laughed at. The mighty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duers
of the continent are retreated into a nutſhell,
and the proud forgivers of our ſins are fled from
thoſe they came to pardon; and all this at a time
when they were diſpatching veſſel after veſſel to
England, with the great news of every day. In
ſhort, you have managed your Jerſey expedition
ſo very dexterouſly, that the dead only are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
becauſe none will diſpute the ground with
them. In all the wars you have formerly been
concerned in, you had only armies to contend
with; in this caſe, you have both an army and a
country to combat with. In former wars, the
countries followed the fate of their capitals; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada
fell with Quebec; and Minorca, with Port
Mahon or St. Philips; by ſubduing thoſe, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
opened a way into, and became maſters
of the country: here it is otherwiſe: if you get
poſſeſſion of a city here, you are obliged to ſhut
yourſelves up in it, and can make no other uſe of
it, than to ſpend your country's money in. This
is all the advantage you have drawn from New-York;
and you would draw leſs from Philadelphia,
becauſe it requires more force to keep it, and is
much farther from the ſea. A pretty figure you
and the Tories would cut in this city, with a river
full of ice, and a town full of fire; for the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1058401600:52"/>
conſequence of your getting here would be,
that you would be cannonaded out again, and the
tories be obliged to make good the damage; and
this, ſooner or later, will be the fate of New York.</p>
            <p>I wiſh to ſee the city ſaved, not ſo much from
military, as from natural motives. It is the hiding-place
of women and children, and Lord Howe's
proper buſineſs is with our armies. When I put
all the circumſtances together which ought to be
taken, I laugh at your notion of conquering Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.
Becauſe you lived in a little country, where
an army might run over the whole in a few days,
and where a ſingle company of ſoldiers might
put a multitude to the rout, you expected to
find it the ſame here. It is plain that you brought
over with you all the narrow notions you were
bred up with, and imagined that a proclamation
in the king's name was to do great things; but
Engliſhmen always travel for knowledge, and your
Lordſhip, I hope, will return, if you return at all,
much wiſer than you came.</p>
            <p>We may be ſurpriſed by events we did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
and in that interval of recollection you may
gain ſome temporary advantage: ſuch was the caſe
a few weeks ago: but we ſoon ripen again into
reaſon, collect our ſtrength, and while you are
preparing for a triumph, we come upon you with
a defeat. Such it has been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuch it would be
were you to try it an hundred times over. Were
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1058401600:53"/>
you to garriſon the places you might march over,
in order to ſecure their ſubjection (for remember
you can do it by no other means), your army
would be like a ſtream of water running to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
By the time you reached from New York
to Virginia, you would be reduced to a ſtring of
drops not capable of hanging together; while we
by retreating from ſtate to ſtate, like a river turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back upon itſelf, would acquire ſtrength in
the ſame proportion as you loſt it, and in the end
be capable of overwhelming you. The country
in the mean time would ſuffer; but it is a day of
ſuffering, and we ought to expect it. What we
contend for is worthy the affliction we may go
through. If we get but bread to eat, and any
kind of raiment to put on, we ought, not only to
be contented, but thankful: more than that we
ought not to look for; and leſs than that, heaven
has not yet ſuffered us to want. He that would
fell his birth-right for a little ſalt, is as worthleſs
as he who ſold it for porrage without falt: and he
that would part with it for a gay coat, or a plain
coat, ought for ever to be a ſlave in buff. What
are ſalt, ſugar, and finery, to the ineſtimable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
of "Liberty and Safety?" Or what are the
inconveniences of a few months to the tributary
bondage of ages? The meaneſt peaſant in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
bleſſed with theſe ſentiments, is a happy man,
compared with a New York tory; he can eat his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1058401600:54"/>
morſel without repining, and when he has done,
can ſweeten it with a repaſt of wholeſome air; he
can take his child by the hand and bleſs it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feeling the conſcious ſhame of neglecting a
parent's duty.</p>
            <p>In publiſhing theſe remarks, I have ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in view. On your part they are, to expoſe
the folly of your pretended authority, as a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner—the
wickedneſs of your cauſe in general—
and the impoſſibility of your conquering us at any
rate. On the part of the public, my meaning is,
to ſhew them their true and ſolid intereſt; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them to their own good; to remove the
fears and falſities, which bad men had ſpread, and
weak men had encouraged; and to excite in all
men a love for union, and a chearfulneſs for duty.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſubmit one more caſe to you, reſpecting
your conqueſt of this country, and then proceed
to new obſervations.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe our armies in every part of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
immediately to diſperſe, every man to his
home, or where elſe he might be ſafe, and engage
to re-aſſemble again on a certain future day. It
is clear that you would then have no army to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with; yet you would be as much at a loſs as
you are now: you would be afraid to ſend your
troops in parties over the continent, either to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm,
or prevent us from aſſembling, leſt they ſhould
not return: and while you kept them together,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1058401600:55"/>
having no army of ours to diſpute with, you could
not call it a conqueſt. You might furniſh out a
pompous page in the London Gazette, or the New
York paper: but when we returned at the appointed
time, you would have the ſame work to do you had
at firſt.</p>
            <p>It has been the folly of Britain to ſuppoſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
more powerful than ſhe really is, and by that
means have arrogated to herſelf a rank in the
world ſhe is not entitled to: for more than this
century paſt ſhe has not been able to carry on a
war without foreign aſſiſtance. In Marlborough's
campaigns, and from that day to this, the number
of German troops and officers aſſiſting her, have
been about equal with her own. Ten thouſand
Heſſians were ſent to England laſt war, to protect
her from a French invaſion: and ſhe would have
cut but a poor figure in her Canadian and Weſt
Indian expeditions, had not America been laviſh
of her men and money to help her along. The
only inſtance, in which ſhe was engaged ſingly,
that I can recollect, was againſt the rebellion in
Scotland in 1745 and 1746, and in that, out of
three battles, ſhe was twice beaten, till by thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
their numbers (as we ſhall yours), and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſupply ſhip, that was coming to Scotland,
with clothes, arms, and money (as we have often
done), ſhe was at laſt enabled to defeat them.</p>
            <p>England was never famous by land. Her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1058401600:56"/>
have generally been ſuſpected of cowardice,
have more of the air of a dancing maſter than a
ſoldier; and by the ſample we have taken priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
we begin to give the preference to ourſelves.
Her ſtrength of late has laid in her extravagance:
but as her finances and her credit are now low, her
ſinews in that line begin to fail faſt. As a nation,
ſhe is the pooreſt in Europe: for were the whole
kingdom, and all that is in it, to be put up to ſale,
like the eſtate of a bankrupt, it would not fetch as
much as ſhe owes. Yet this thoughtleſs wretch
muſt go to war, and with the avowed deſign, too,
of making us beaſts of burden, to ſupport her in
riot and debauchery, and to aſſiſt her afterwards in
diſtreſſing thoſe nations who are now our beſt
friends. This ingratitude may ſuit a tory, or the
unchriſtian peeviſhneſs of a fallen quaker, but none
elſe.</p>
            <p>It is the unhappy temper of the Engliſh, to be
pleaſed with any war, right or wrong, be it but
ſucceſsful: but they ſoon grow diſcontented with
ill fortune: and it is an even chance, that they are
as clamourous for peace next ſummer, as the king
and his miniſters were for war laſt winter. In this
natural view of things, your Lordſhip ſtands in a
very ugly critical ſituation. Your whole charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is ſtaked upon your laurels: if they wither, you
wither with them. If they flouriſh, you cannot
live long to look at them: and at any rate, the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1058401600:57"/>
black account hereafter is not far off. What
lately appeared to us misfortunes, were only bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
in diſguiſe: and the ſeeming advantages on
your ſide have turned out to our profit. Even
our loſs of this city, as far as we can ſee, might
be a principal gain to us. The more ſurface you
ſpread over, the thinner you will be, and the eaſier
wiped away: and our conſolation, under that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
diſaſter, would be, that the eſtates of the
tories would be ſecurities for the repairs. In ſhort,
there is no old ground we can fail upon, but ſome
new foundation riſes again to ſupport us. "We
have put, Sir, our hands to the plough—and curſed
be he that looketh back."</p>
            <p>Your king, in his ſpeech to parliament, laſt
ſpring, declared to them, that "he had no doubt
but the great force they had enabled him to ſend
to America would effectually reduce the rebellious
colonies." It has not—neither can it. But it has
done juſt enough to ſay the foundation of its own
next year's ruin. You are ſenſible that you left
England in a divided diſtracted ſtate of politics, and,
by the command you had here, you became a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
prop in the court party: their fortunes reſt
on yours: by a ſingle expreſs, you can fix their
value with the public, and the degree to which
their ſpirits ſhall riſe or fall. They are in your
hands as ſtock, and you have the ſecret of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
with you. Thus ſituated, and connected, you
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1058401600:58"/>
become the unintentional, mechanical inſtrument
of your own and their overthrow. The king and his
miniſters put conqueſt out of doubt, and the credit
of both depended on the proof. To ſupport them
in the interim, it was neceſſary that you ſhould
make the moſt of every thing: and we can tell by
Hugh Gaine's New York paper, what the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
of the London Gazette is. With ſuch a
liſt of victories, the nation cannot expect you will
aſk new ſupplies; and to confeſs your want of them,
would give the lie to your triumphs, and impeach
the king and his miniſters of treaſonable decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If you make the neceſſary demand at home,
your party ſinks: if you make it not, you ſink
yourſelf. To aſk it now, is too late, and to aſk it
before, was too ſoon, and unleſs it arrive quickly,
will be of no uſe. In ſhort, the part you have to
act, cannot be acted: and I am fully perſuaded,
that all you have to truſt to is, to do the beſt with
what force you have got, or little more. Though
we have greatly excelled you in point of general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and bravery of men, yet, as a people, we
have not entered into the full ſoul of enterprize:
for I, who know England, and the diſpoſition of the
people well, am confident, that it is eaſier for us to
effect a revolution there, than you a conqueſt here.
A few thouſand men, landed in England, with the
declared deſign of depoſing the preſent king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
bringing his miniſters to trial, and ſetting up the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1058401600:59"/>
Duke of Glouceſter in his ſtead, would aſſuredly
carry their point, while you were grovelling here
ignorant of the matter. As I ſend all my papers
to England, this, like Common Senſe, will find its
way there: and though it may put one party on
their guard, it will inform the other, and the nation
in general, of our deſign to help them.</p>
            <p>Thus far, Sir, I have endeavoured to give you
a picture of preſent affairs: you may draw from it
what concluſion you pleaſe. I wiſh as well to the
true poſterity of England as you can, but I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
independence as America's natural right and
intereſt, and never could ſee any real diſſervice it
would be to Britain. If an Engliſh merchant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
an order, and is paid for it, it ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to him who governs the country. This is
my creed of politics. If I have any where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
myſelf over warmly, it is from a fixt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
hatred I have, and ever had, to cruel
men and cruel meaſures. I have likewiſe an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to monarchy, as being too debaſing to the
dignity of man; but I never troubled others with
my notions till very lately, nor ever publiſhed a
ſyllable in England in my life. What I write is
pure nature, and my pen and my ſoul have ever
gone together. My writings I have always given
away, reſerving only the expence of printing and
paper, and ſometimes not even that. I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
courted either fame or intereſt, and my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1058401600:60"/>
of life, to thoſe who know it, will juſtify what
I ſay. My ſtudy is, to be uſeful, and if your
Lordſhip love mankind as well as I do, you would,
ſeeing you cannot conquer us, caſt about and lend
your hand towards accompliſhing a peace. Our
independence, with God's bleſſing, we will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
againſt all the world: but as we wiſh to avoid
evil ourſelves, we wiſh not to inflict it on others.
I am never over inquiſitive into the ſecrets of the
cabinet, but I have ſome notion, if you neglect
the preſent opportunity, that it will not be in our
power to make a ſeparate peace with you after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
for whatever treaties or alliances we form,
we ſhall moſt faithfully abide by: wherefore you
may be deceived, if you think you can make it
with us at any time. A laſting independent peace
is my wiſh, end, and aim; and to accompliſh that,
"I pray God the Americans may never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
and I truſt while they have good officers,
and are well commanded, and willing to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
that they never will."</p>

            <head>No. IV.</head>
            <p>IN the progreſs of politics, as in the common
occurrences of life, we are not only apt to forget
the ground we have travelled over, but frequently
neglect to gather up experience as we go. We
expend, if I may ſo ſay, the knowledge of every
day on the circumſtances that produce it, and
journey on in ſearch of new matter and new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements:
but as it is pleaſant, and ſometimes
uſeful, to look back, even to the firſt periods of
infancy, and trace the turns and windings through
which we have paſſed, ſo we may likewiſe derive
many advantages by halting a while in our politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
career, and taking a review of the wonderous
complicated labyrinth of little more than yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
            <p>Truly, may we ſay, that never did man grow old
in ſo ſhort a time! We have crowded the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of an age into the compaſs of a few months,
and have been driven through ſuch a rapid ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of things, that, for the want of leiſure to
think, we unavoidably waſted knowledge as we
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1058401600:62"/>
came, and have left nearly as much behind us as
we brought with us: but the road is yet rich with
fragments, and, before we fully loſe ſight of them,
will repay us for the trouble of ſtopping to pick
them up.</p>
            <p>Were a man to be totally deprived of memory,
he would be incapable of forming any juſt opinion;
every thing about him would ſeem a chaos; he
would even have his own hiſtory to aſk from every
one; and by not knowing how the world went on
in his abſence, he would be at a loſs to know how
it OUGHT to go on when he recovered, or rather
returned to it again. In like manner, though in a
leſs degree, a too great inattention to paſt occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
retards and bewilders our judgment in
every thing; while, on the contrary, by comparing
what is paſt with what is preſent, we frequently
hit on the true character of both, and become wiſe
with very little trouble. It is a kind of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march,
by which we get into the rear of Time, and
mark the movements and meaning of things as we
make our return. There are certain circumſtances,
which, at the time of their happening, are kind of
riddles; and as every riddle is to be followed by
its anſwer, ſo thoſe kind of circumſtances will be
followed by their events, and thoſe events are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the true ſolution. A conſiderable ſpace of
time may lapſe between, and unleſs we continue
our obſervations from the one to the other, the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1058401600:63"/>
harmony of them will paſs away unnoticed: but
the misfortune is, that partly from the preſſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of ſome inſtant things, and partly from the
impatience of our tempers, we are frequently in
ſuch a hurry to make out the meaning of every
thing as faſt as it happens, that we thereby never
truly underſtand it; and not only ſtart new diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
to ourſelves by ſo doing, but, as it were,
embarraſs Providence in her good deſigns.</p>
            <p>I have been civil in ſtating this fault on a large
ſcale; for, as it now ſtands, it does not appear to
be levelled againſt any particular ſet of men; but
were it to be refined a little further, it might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
be applied to the Tories with a degree of
ſtriking propriety: thoſe men have been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for drawing ſudden concluſions from ſingle
facts. The leaſt apparent miſhap on our ſide, or
the leaſt ſeeming advantage on the part of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
have determined the fate of a whole cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign.
By this haſty judgment they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
a retreat into a defeat; miſtook generalſhip
for error: while every little advantage purpoſely
given the enemy, either to weaken their ſtrength
by dividing it, embarraſs their councils by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
their objects, or to ſecure a greater poſt
by the ſurrender of a leſs, has been inſtantly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
into a conqueſt. Thus, by quartering ill
policy upon ill principles, they have frequently
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1058401600:64"/>
promoted the cauſe they deſigned to injure, and
injured that which they intended to promote.</p>
            <p>It is probable the campaign may open before
this number comes from the preſs. The enemy
have long lain idle, and amuſed themſelves with
carrying on the war by proclamations only. While
they continue their delay, our ſtrength increaſes:
and were they to move to action now, it is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial
proof they have no reinforcement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
wherefore, in either caſe, the comparative
advantage will be ours. Like a wounded diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
whale they want only time and room to die in;
and though in the agony of their exit, it may be
unſafe to live within the flapping of their tail, yet
every hour ſhortens their date, and leſſens their
power of miſchief. If any thing happens while
this Number is in the preſs, it will afford me a
ſubject for the laſt pages of it. At preſent I am
tired of waiting; and as neither the enemy, nor
the ſtate of politics, have YET produced any thing
new, I am thereby left in the field of general
matter undirected by any ſtriking or particular
object. This Criſis, therefore, will be made up
rather of variety than novelty, and conſiſt more of
things uſeful than things wonderful.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs of the cauſe, the union of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the means of ſupporting and ſecuring both,
are points which cannot be too much attended to.
He who doubts of the former is a deſponding cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1058401600:65"/>
and he who wilfully diſturbs the latter is a
traitor. Their characters are eaſily fixed, and
under theſe ſhort deſcriptions I leave them for the
preſent.</p>
            <p>One of the greateſt degrees of ſentimental uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which America ever knew, was in denying the
right of the Britiſh Parliament "TO BIND THE
COLONIES IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER." The
declaration is in its form an almighty one, and
is the loftieſt ſtretch of arbitrary power that ever
one ſet of men, or one country claimed over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Taxation was nothing more than putting the
declared right into practice; and this failing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
was had to arms, as a means to eſtabliſh
both the right and the practice, or to anſwer a
worſe purpoſe, which will be mentioned in the
courſe of this Number. And in order to repay
themſelves the expence of an army, and to profit
by their own injuſtice, the Colonies were, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
law, declared to be in a ſtate of actual rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and of conſequence all property therein
would fall to the conquerors.</p>
            <p>The Colonies, on their part, firſt, denied the
right; ſecondly, they ſuſpended the uſe of taxable
articles, and petitioned againſt the practice of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation:
and theſe failing, they, thirdly, defended
their property by force, as ſoon as it was forcibly
invaded; and in anſwer to the declaration of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
and non-protection, publiſhed their decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1058401600:66"/>
of Independence, and right to ſelf-protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Theſe, in a few words, are the different ſtages
of the quarrel; and the parts are ſo intimately and
neceſſarily connected with each other, as to admit
of no ſeparation. A perſon, to uſe a trite phraſe,
muſt be a Whig or a Tory in the lump. His feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
as a man, may be wounded; his charity, as a
Chriſtian, may be moved: but his political prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
muſt go through all the caſes on one ſide or
the other. He cannot be a Whig in <hi>this</hi> ſtage, and
a Tory in <hi>that.</hi> If he ſays he is againſt the United
Independence of the Continent, he is, to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
and purpoſes againſt her in all the reſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
THIS LAST comprehends the whole. And
he may juſt as well ſay, that Britain was right in
declaring us rebels; right in taxing us; and right
in declaring her "RIGHT TO BIND THE COLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIES
IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER." It ſignifies
nothing what neutral ground, of his own creation,
he may ſkulk upon for ſhelter; for the quarrel in
no ſtage of it hath afforded any ſuch ground; and
either we or Britain are abſolutely right or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
wrong through the whole.</p>
            <p>Britain, like a gameſter nearly ruined, hath now
put all her loſſes into one bet, and is playing a
deſperate game for the total. If ſhe win it, ſhe
wins from me MY life; ſhe wins the Continent as
the forfeited property of rebels; the right of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1058401600:67"/>
thoſe that are left as reduced ſubjects; and the
power of binding them as ſlaves: And the ſingle die
which determines this unparalleled event is, whether
we ſupport our independence or ſhe overturn it.
This is coming to the point at once. Here is the
touch-ſtone to try men by. <hi>He that is not a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter
of the independent ſtates of America; in the
ſame degree that his religious and political principles
would ſuffer him to ſupport the government of any
other country, of which he called himſelf a ſubject,
is, in the American ſenſe of the word,</hi> A TORY<hi>;
and theinſtant that he endeavors to bring his toryiſm
into practice, he becomes</hi> A TRAITOR. The
firſt man can only be detected by a general teſt,
and the law hath already provided for the latter.</p>
            <p>It is unnatural and impolitic to admit men who
would root up our independence to have any ſhare
in our legiſlation, either as electors or repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
becauſe the ſupport of our independence
reſts in a great meaſure on the vigour and purity of
our public bodies. Would Britain, even in time
of peace, much leſs in war, ſuffer an election to be
carried by men who profeſſed themſelves not to be
her ſubjects, or allow ſuch to ſit in parliament? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
not.</p>
            <p>But there are a certain ſpecies of tories with
whom conſcience or principle hath nothing to do,
and who are ſo from avarice only. Some of the
firſt fortunes in the continent, on the part of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1058401600:68"/>
whigs, are ſtaked on the iſſue of our preſent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
And ſhall diſaffection only be rewarded with
ſecurity? Can any thing be a greater inducement
to a miſerly man, than the hope of making his
mammon ſafe? And though the ſcheme be fraught
with every character of folly, yet, ſo long as he
ſuppoſes, that by doing nothing materially crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
againſt America on one part, and by expreſſing
his private diſapprobation againſt independence, as
a palliative with the enemy on the other part, he
ſtands thereby in a ſafe line between both, while, I
ſay, this ground be ſuffered to remain, craft and
the ſpirit of avarice will point it out, and men will
not be wanting to fill up this moſt contemptible of
all characters.</p>
            <p>Theſe men, aſhamed to own the ſordid cauſe
from whence their diſaffection ſprings, and thereby
add meanneſs to meanneſs, by endeavouring to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themſelves under the maſk of hypocriſy; that is,
they had rather be thought to be tories from <hi>ſome
kind of principle,</hi> than tories by having <hi>no principle
at all.</hi> But till ſuch time as they can ſhow ſome
real reaſon, natural, political or conſcientious, on
which their objections to independence are founded,
we are not obliged to give them credit for being
tories of the firſt ſtamp, but muſt ſet them down as
tories of the laſt.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond number of the Criſis I endeavoured
to ſhew the impoſſibility of the enemy making any
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1058401600:69"/>
conqueſt of America that nothing was wanting on
our part but patience and perſeverance, and that,
with theſe virtues, our ſucceſs, as far as human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
could diſcern, ſeemed as certain as fate.
But as there are many among us, who, influenced
by others, have regularly gone back from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
they once held, in proportion as we have gone
forward; and as it is the unfortunate lot of many a
good man to live within the neighbourhood of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
ones; I ſhall therefore, for the ſake of
confirming the one and recovering the other, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
in the ſpace of a page or two, to go over
ſome of the leading principles in ſupport of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.
It is a much pleaſanter taſk to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
vice than to puniſh it; and however our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
may be gratified by reſentment, or our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
expences eaſed by forfeited eſtates, harmony
and friendſhip is nevertheleſs the happieſt condition
a country can be bleſt with.</p>
            <p>The principal arguments in ſupport of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
may be comprehended under the four fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
heads.<list>
                  <item>Firſt,—The natural right of the continent to
independence.</item>
                  <item>Secondly,—Her intereſt in being independent.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly—The neceſſity,—and</item>
                  <item>Fourthly,—The moral advantages ariſing
therefrom.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:1058401600:70"/>
I. The natural right of the continent to indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
is a point which never yet was called in
queſtion. It will not even admit of a debate. To
deny ſuch a right, would be a kind of atheiſm
againſt nature: And the beſt anſwer to fuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
would be, "<hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart,
there is no God.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="2">II. The intereſt of the continent in being inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
is a point as clearly right as the former.
America, by her own internal induſtty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to all the powers of Europe, was at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the diſpute, arrived at a pitch of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
trade and population, beyond which it was the
intereſt of Britain not to ſuffer her to paſs, leſt ſhe
ſhould grow too powerful to be kept ſubordinate.
She began to view this country with the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
malicious eye, with which a covetous guardian
would view his ward whoſe eſtate he had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
himſelf by for twenty years, and ſaw him
juſt arriving to manhood. And America owes no
more to Britain for her preſent maturity, than the
ward would to his guardian for being twenty-one
years of age. That America hath flouriſhed <hi>at the
time</hi> ſhe was under the government of Britain, is
true; but there is every natural reaſon to believe,
that had ſhe been an independent country from the
firſt ſettlement thereof, uncontrouled by any foreign
power, free to make her own laws, regulate and
encourage her own commerce, ſhe had by his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1058401600:71"/>
time been of much greater worth than now. The
caſe is ſimply this, The firſt ſettlers in the different
colonies were left to ſhift for themſelves, unnoticed
and unſupported by any European government;
but as the tyranny and perſecution of the old world
daily drove numbers to the new, and, as by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of Heaven on their induſtry and perſeverance,
they grew into importance, ſo, in a like degree,
they became an object of profit to the greedy eyes
of Europe. It was impoſſible in this ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
however thriving and promiſing, that they
could reſiſt the power of any armed invader that
ſhould ſeek to bring them under his authority. In
this ſituation Britain thought it worth her while to
claim them, and the continent received and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the claimer. It was, in reality, of no
very great importance who was her maſter, ſeeing
that from the force and ambition of the different
powers of Europe ſhe muſt, till ſhe acquired
ſtrength enough to aſſert her own right, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſome one. As well, perhaps, Britain as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and it might have been as well to have been
under the ſtates of Holland as any. The ſame hopes
of engroſſing and profiting by her trade, by not
oppreſſing it too much, would have operated
alike with any maſter, and produced to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the ſame effects. The clamour of protection
likewiſe, was all a farce; becauſe, in order to make
<hi>that</hi> protection neceſſary, ſhe muſt firſt, by her own
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1058401600:72"/>
quarrels create us enemies. Hard terms indeed!</p>
            <p>To know whether it be the intereſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to be independent, we need only aſk this
eaſy, ſimple queſtion: Is it the intereſt of a man
to be a boy all his life? The anſwer to one will be
the anſwer to both. America hath been one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſcene of legiſlative contention from the firſt
king's repreſentative to the laſt; and this was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
founded in the natural oppoſition of intereſt
between the old country and the new. A governor
ſent from England, or receiving his authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
ought never to have been conſidered in any
other light than that of a genteel commiſſioned ſpy,
whoſe private buſineſs was information, and his
public buſineſs a kind of civilized oppreſſion. In
the firſt of theſe characters he was to watch the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
ſentiments and diſpoſition of the people, the
growth of trade, and the increaſe of private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
and in the latter, to ſuppreſs all ſuch acts of
the aſſemblies, however beneficial to the people,
which did not directly or indirectly throw ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of power or profit into the hands of thoſe
who ſent him.</p>
            <p>America, till now, could never be called a <hi>free
country,</hi> becauſe her legiſlation depended on the
will of a man three thouſand miles diſtant, whoſe
intereſt was in oppoſition to ours, and who by a
ſingle "no," could forbid what law he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>The freedom of trade, likewiſe, is, to a trading
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1058401600:73"/>
country, an article of ſuch vaſt importance, that
the principal ſource of wealth depends upon it; and
it is impoſſible that any country can flouriſh, as it
otherwiſe might do, whoſe commerce is engroſſed
cramped and fettered by the laws and mandates of
another—yet theſe evils, and more than I can here
enumerate, the continent has ſuffered by being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the government of Great Britain. By an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
we clear the whole at once—put an end
to the buſineſs of unanſwered petitions and fruitleſs
remonſtrances—exchange Britain for Europe—
ſhake hands with the world—live at peace with
mankind—and trade to any market where we beſt
can buy and ſell.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The neceſſity, likewiſe, of being independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
even before it was declared, became ſo evident
and important, that the continent ran the riſk of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ruined every day ſhe delayed it. There were
reaſons to believe that Britain would endeavour to
make an European matter of it, and rather than loſe
the whole, would diſmember it like Poland, and
diſpoſe of her ſeveral claims to the higheſt bidder.
Genoa, failing in her attempts to reduce Corſica,
made a ſale of it to the French, and ſuch traffics
have been common in the old world. We had at
that time no Ambaſſador in any part of Europe, to
counteract her negociations, and by that means ſhe
had the range of every foreign court uncontradicted
on our part. We even knew nothing of the treaty
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1058401600:74"/>
for the Heſſians till it was concluded, and the troops
ready to embark. Had we been independent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we had probably prevented her obtaining them.
We had no credit abroad, becauſe of our rebellious
dependency. Our ſhips could claim no protection
in foreign ports, becauſe we afforded them no juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
reaſon for granting it to us. The calling
ourſelves ſubjects, and at the ſame time fighting
againſt the power we acknowledged, was a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
precedent to all Europe. If the grievances
juſtified our taking up arms, they juſtified our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;
if they did not juſtify our ſeparation,
neither could they juſtify our taking up arms. All
Europe was intereſted in reducing us as rebels, and
all Europe (or the greateſt part at leaſt) is intereſted
in ſupporting us as independent ſtates. At home
our condition was ſtill worſe: Our currency had
no foundation. and the fall of it would have ruined
whig and tory alike. We had no other law than a
kind of moderated paſſion; no other civil power
than an honeſt mob; and no other protection than
the temporary attachment of one man to another.
Had independence been delayed a few months lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
this continent would have been plunged into
irrecoverable confuſion: Some violent for it, ſome
againſt it, till in the general cabal the rich would
have been ruined, and the poor deſtroyed. It is
to independence that every tory owes the preſent
ſafety he lives in; for by <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>that only,</hi> we
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1058401600:75"/>
emerged from a ſtate of dangerous ſuſpenſe, and
became a regular people.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity likewiſe of being independent, had
there been no rupture between Britain and America,
would in a little time have brought one on. The
encreaſing importance of commerce, the weight
and perplexity of legiſlation, and the entangled ſtate
of European politics, would daily have ſhewn to
the continent the impoſſibility of continuing ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate;
for, after the cooleſt reflections on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
this muſt be allowed, that Britain was too jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of America, to govern it juſtly; too ignorant
of it, to govern it well; and too diſtant from it, to
govern it at all.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. But, what weigh moſt with all men of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
reflection are the MORAL ADVANTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GES
ariſing from independence: War and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are become the trades of the old world; and
America neither could nor can be under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Britain without becoming a ſharer of
her guilt, and a partner in all the diſmal commerce
of death. The ſpirit of duelling, extended on a
national ſcale, is a proper character for European
wars. They have ſeldom any other motive than
pride, or any other object than fame. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
and the conquered are generally ruined
alike, and the chief difference at laſt is, that the
one marches home with his honours, and the other
without them. 'Tis the natural temper of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1058401600:76"/>
Engliſh to fight for a feather, if they ſuppoſe <hi>that
feather</hi> to be an affront; and America, without the
right of aſking why, muſt have abetted in every
quarrel and abided by its fate. It is a ſhocking
ſituation to live in, that one country muſt be
brought into all the wars of another, whether the
meaſure be right or wrong, or whether ſhe will or
not; yet this, in the fulleſt extent, was, and ever
would be, the unavoidable conſequence of the
connection. Surely! the Quakers forgot their
own principles, when in their late teſtimony
they called <hi>this connection</hi> with theſe military and
miſerable appendages hanging to it, "<hi>The happy
conſtitution.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Britain, for centuries paſt has been nearly fifty
years out of every hundred at war with ſome power
or other. It certainly ought to be a conſcientious
as well as political conſideration with America, not
to dip her hands in the bloody work of Europe.
Our ſituation affords us a retreat from their cabals,
and the preſent happy union of the ſtates bids fair
for extirpating the future uſe of arms from one
quarter of the world; yet ſuch have been the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
politics of the preſent leaders of the Quakers,
that, for the ſake of they ſcarce knew what, they
would cut off every hope of ſuch a bleſſing by ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this continent to Britain, like Hector to the
chariot-wheel of Achilles, to be dragged through
all the miſeries of endleſs European wars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:1058401600:77"/>
The connection, viewed from this ground, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing
to every man who has the feelings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.
By having Britain for our maſter, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
enemies to the greateſt part of Europe, and
they to us; and the conſequence was war inevitable.
By being our own maſters, independent of any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
one, we have Europe for our friends, and the
proſpect of an endleſs peace among ourſelves.
Thoſe who were advocates for the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over theſe colonies, were obliged to limit both
their arguments and their ideas to the period of an
European peace only: The moment Britain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
plunged in war, every ſuppoſed convenience
to us vaniſhed away, and all we could hope for was
<hi>not to be ruined.</hi> Could this be a deſirable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for a young country to be in?</p>
            <p>Had the French purſued their fortune immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after the defeat of Braddock, laſt war this city
and province had then experienced the woeful ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
of being a Britiſh ſubject. A ſcene of the
ſame kind might happen again; for America, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as a ſubject to the crown of Britain, would
ever have been the ſeat of war and the bone of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
between the two powers.</p>
            <p>On the whole, if the future expulſion of arms
from one quarter of the world be a deſirable object
to a peaceable man;—if the freedom of trade to
every part of it can engage the attention of a man
of buſineſs;—if the ſupport or fall of millions of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1058401600:78"/>
currency can affect our intereſt;—if the entire poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of eſtates, by cutting off the lordly claims of
Britain over the ſoil, deſerves the regard of landed
property;—and if the right of making our own laws,
uncontrouled by royal or miniſterial ſpies or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,
be worthy our care as freemen;—then are
all men intereſted in the ſupport of independence;
and may he that ſupports it not, be driven from the
bleſſing, and live unpitied beneath the ſervile ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of ſcandalous ſubjection!</p>
            <p>We have been amuſed with the tales of ancient
wonders; we have read, and wept over, the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of other nations; applauded, cenſured or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied,
as their caſes affected us.—The fortitude and
patience of the ſufferers—the juſtneſs of their cauſe
—the weight of their oppreſſions and oppreſſors—
the object to be ſaved or loſt—with all the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of a defeat or a conqueſt—have, in the
hour of ſympathy, bewitched our hearts and chained
it to their fate: But where is the power that ever
made war upon petitioners? Or where is the war
on which a world was ſtaked till now?</p>
            <p>We may not, perhaps, be wiſe enough to make
all the advantages we ought of our independence;
but they are, nevertheleſs, marked and preſented
to us with every character of GREAT and GOOD
and worthy the hand of Him who ſent them. I
look through the preſent trouble to a time of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
when we ſhall have it in our power to ſet
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1058401600:79"/>
an example of peace to all the world. Were the
Quakers really impreſſed and influenced by the quiet
principles they profeſs to hold, they would, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they might diſapprove the means, be the firſt
of all men to approve of INDEPENDENCE,
becauſe, by ſeparating from the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah, it affords an opportunity, never given
to man before, of carrying their favourite principle
of peace into general practice, by eſtabliſhing go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
that ſhall hereafter exiſt without wars.
Oh ye fallen, cringing prieſt and Pemberton-rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
people! what more can we ſay of ye than that
a religious Quaker is a valuable character, and a
political Quaker a real Jeſuit.</p>
            <p>Having thus gone over ſome of the principal
points in ſupport of independence, I muſt now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
the reader to return back with me to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
when it firſt began to be a public doctrine, and
to examine the progreſs it has made among the
various claſſes of men. The aera I mean to begin
at, is the breaking out of hoſtilities, April 19th,
1775. Until this event happened, the continent
ſeemed to view the diſpute as a kind of law-ſuit for
a matter of right, litigating between the old coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and the new; and ſhe felt the ſame kind and
degree of horror, as if ſhe had ſeen an oppreſſive
plantiff, at the head of a band of ruffians, enter the
court, while the cauſe was before it, and put the
judge, the jury, the defendant and his council to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1058401600:80"/>
ſword. Perhaps a more heart-felt convulſion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reached a country with the ſame degree of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and rapidity before, and never may again. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the ſufferers, mixed with indignation at the
violence, and heightened with apprehenſions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing
the ſame fate, made the affair of Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington
the affair of the continent. Every part of it
felt the ſhock and all vibrated together. A gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
promotion of ſentiment took place: Thoſe who
had drank deeply into whiggiſh principles, that is,
the right and neceſſity not only of oppoſing, but
wholly ſetting aſide the power of the crown as ſoon
as it became practically dangerous (for in theory it
was always ſo) ſtept into the firſt ſtage of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
while another claſs of whigs, equally ſound
in principle, but not ſo ſanguine in enterprize, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
themſelves the ſtronger to the cauſe and fell
cloſe in with the rear of the former; their partition
was a mere point. Numbers of the moderate men
whoſe chief fault, <hi>at that time,</hi> aroſe from their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
a better opinion of Britain than ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
convinced now of their miſtake, gave her
up and publicly declared themſelves good whigs.
While the tories, ſeeing it was no longer a laughing
matter, either ſunk into ſilent obſcurity, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
themſelves with coming forth and abuſing
General Gage: Not a ſingle advocate appeared to
juſtify the action of that day; it ſeemed to appear
to every one with the ſame magnitude, ſtruck every
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1058401600:81"/>
one with the ſame force, and created in every one
the ſame abhorrence. From this period we may
date the growth of independence.</p>
            <p>If the many circumſtances, which happened at
this memorable time, be taken in one view, and
compared with each other, they will juſtify a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
which ſeems not to be attended to, I mean
a fixt deſign in the king and miniſtry of driving
America into arms, in order that they might be
furniſhed with a pretence for ſeizing the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
as the immediate property of the crown.
A noble plunder for hungry courtiers!</p>
            <p>It ought to be remembered, that the firſt peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the congreſs was at this time unanſwered
on the part of the Britiſh king. That the motion
called Lord North's motion, of the 20th of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,
1775, arrived in America the latter end of
March. This motion was to be laid by the ſeveral
governors, then in being, before the aſſembly of
each province; and the firſt aſſembly before which
it was laid, was the aſſembly of Pennſylvania in
May following. This being a juſt ſtate of the caſe,
I then aſk, why were hoſtilities commenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the time of paſſing the reſolve in the houſe
of commons, of the 20th of February, and the
time of the aſſemblies meeting to deliberate upon
it? Degrading and infamous as that motion was,
there is, nevertheleſs, reaſon to believe that the
king and his adherents were afraid the colonies would
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1058401600:82"/>
agree to it, and leſt they ſhould, took effectual care
they ſhould not, by provoking them with hoſtilities
in the interim. They had not the leaſt doubt at
that time of conquering America at one blow;
and what they expected to get by a conqueſt being
infinitely greater than any thing they could hope to
get either by taxation or accommodation, they
ſeemed determined to prevent even the poſſibility
of hearing each other, leſt America ſhould diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
their greedy hopes of the whole, by liſtening
even to their own terms. On the one hand they
refufed to hear the petition of the continent, and on
the other hand took effectual care the continent
ſhould not hear them.</p>
            <p>That the motion of the 20th of February and the
orders for commencing hoſtilities were both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
by the ſame perſon or perſons, and not the
latter by General Gage, as was falſely imagined at
firſt, is evident from an extract of a letter of his to
adminiſtration, read among other papers in the
houſe of commons; in which he informs his maſters,
<hi>That though their idea of his diſarming certain coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
was a right one, yet it required him to be maſter
of the country, in order to enable him to execute it.</hi>
This was prior to the commencement of hoſtilities
and conſequently before the motion of the 20th of
February could be deliberated on by the ſeveral
aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:1058401600:83"/>
Perhaps it may be aſked, why was the motion
paſt, if there was at the ſame time a plan to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the Americans not to liſten to it? Lord North
aſſigned one reaſon himſelf, which was, <hi>a hope of
dividing them.</hi> This was publicly tempting them
to reject it; that if, in caſe, the injury of arms
ſhould fail of provoking them ſufficiently, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of ſuch a declaration might fill it up. But by
paſſing the motion and getting it afterwards rejected
in America, it enabled them, in their wretched
idea of politics, among other things, to hold up the
colonies to foreign powers with every poſſible mark
of diſobedience and rebellion. They had applied
to thoſe powers not to ſupply the continent with
arms, ammunition, &amp;c. and it was neceſſary they
ſhould incenſe them againſt us by aſſigning on their
own part ſome ſeeming reputable reaſon why.
By dividing, it had a tendency to weaken the
ſtates, and likewiſe to perplex the adherents of
America in England. But the principal ſcheme,
and that which has marked their character in every
part of their conduct, was a deſign of precipitating
the colonies into a ſtate which they might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
deem rebellion, and under that pretence put
an end to all future complaints, petitions or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances,
by ſeizing the whole at once. They
had ravaged one part of the globe, till it could glut
them no longer; their prodigality required new
plunder, and through the Eaſt-India article TEA,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1058401600:84"/>
they hoped to transfer their rapine from that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the world to this.—Every deſigned quarrel
has its pretence; and the ſame barbarian avarice
accompanied the plant to America, which ruined
the country which produced it.</p>
            <p>That men never turn rogues without turning
fools, is a maxim, ſooner or later, univerſally true.
The commencement of hoſtilities, being in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of April, was, of all times the worſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen:
The congreſs were to meet the tenth of May
following, and the diſtreſs the continent felt at this
unparalleled outrage gave a ſtability to that body,
which no other circumſtance could have done. It
ſuppreſſed too, all inferior debates, and bound them
together by a neceſſitous affection, without giving
them time to differ upon trifles. The ſuffering
likewiſe, ſoftened the whole body of the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a degree of pliability, which laid the principal
foundation-ſtone of union, order and government;
and which, at any other time, might only have
fretted and then faded away unnoticed and unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:
But providence, who beſt knows how to
time her misfortunes as well as her immediate favors,
choſe this to be the time. And who dares diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it?</p>
            <p>It did not ſeem the diſpoſition of the people at
this criſis to heap petition upon petition, while the
former remained unanſwered: The meaſure, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
was carried in congreſs, and a ſecond petition
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1058401600:85"/>
was ſent; of which I ſhall only remark, that it was
ſubmiſſive even to a dangerous fault, becauſe the
prayer of it appealed ſolely to, what it called, the
prerogative of the crown, while the matter in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
was confeſſed to be conſtitutional. But even
this petition, flattering as it was, was ſtill not ſo
harmonious as the chink of caſh, and conſequently
not ſufficiently grateful to the tyrant and his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
From every circumſtance it is evident, that
it was the determination of the Britiſh court to have
nothing to do with America but to conquer it fully
and abſolutely. They were certain of ſucceſs, and the
field of battle was to be the only place of treaty.
I am confident there are thouſands and tens of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
in America who wonder now they ſhould
ever think otherwiſe; but the ſin of that day was
the ſin of civility, yet it operated againſt our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
good in the ſame manner that a civil opinion
of the devil would againſt our future peace.</p>
            <p>Independence was a doctrine ſcarce and rare even
towards the concluſion of the year ſeventy-five:
All our politics had been founded on the hope or
expectation of making the matter up—a hope,
which, though general on the ſide of America, had
never entered the head or heart of the Britiſh court.
Their hope was conqueſt and confiſcation. Good
Heavens! what volumes of thanks does America
owe to Britain! What infinite obligations to the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1058401600:86"/>
tool, that fills, with paradoxical vacancy, the
throne! Nothing but the ſharpeſt effence of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy,
compounded with the ſtrongeſt diſtillation of
folly, could have produced a menſtruum that
would have effected a ſeparation. The congreſs
in ſeventy-four adminiſtered an abortive medicine
to independence, by prohibiting the importation of
goods, and the ſucceeding congreſs rendered the
doſe ſtill more dangerous by continuing it. Had
independence been a ſettled ſyſtem with America
(as Britain has advanced) ſhe ought to have dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
her importation, and prohibited in ſome degree
her exportation. And this ſingle circumſtance is
ſufficient to acquit America, before any jury of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
of having a continental plan of independence
in view: A charge, which had it been true, would
have been honourable, but is ſo groſsly falſe, that
either the amazing ignorance, or the wilful diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty
of the Britiſh court, is effectually proved by
it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond petition, like the firſt, produced no
anſwer: it was ſcarcely acknowledged to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
the Britiſh court were too determined in their
villany even to act it artfully, and in their rage for
conqueſt, neglected the neceſſary ſubtilties for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
it. They might have divided, diſtracted,
and played a thouſand tricks with us, had they been
as cunning as they were cruel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:1058401600:87"/>
This laſt indignity gave a new ſpring to indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Thoſe who knew the ſavage obſtinacy of
the king and the jobbing gambling ſpirit of the court
predicted the fate of the petition, as ſoon as it was
ſent from America; for the men being known, their
meaſures were eaſily foreſeen. As politicians, we
ought not ſo much to ground our hope on the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
of the thing we aſk, as on the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
of the perſon of whom we aſk it; Who
would expect diſcretion from a fool, candor from
a tyrant, or juſtice from a villain?</p>
            <p>As every proſpect of accommodation ſeemed
now to fail faſt, men began to think ſeriouſly on the
matter; and their reaſon being thus ſtript of the
falſe hope which had long encompaſſed it, became
approachable by fair debate; yet ſtill the bulk of
the people heſitated; they ſtartled at the novelty
of independence, without once conſidering that our
getting into arms at firſt was a more extraordinary
novelty, and that all other nations had gone through
the work of independence before us. They doubted,
likewiſe, the ability of the continent to ſupport it,
without reflecting, that it required the ſame force
to obtain an accommodation by arms as an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.
If the one was acquirable, the other was
the ſame; becauſe to accompliſh either, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that our ſtrength ſhould be too great for
Britain to ſubdue; and it was too unreaſonable to
ſuppoſe, that with the power of being maſters, we
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1058401600:88"/>
ſhould ſubmit to be ſervants<note n="*" place="bottom">In this ſtate of political ſuſpenſe, the pamphlet <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe,</hi> made its appearance, and the ſucceſs it met with does not become me to mention. Dr. Franklin, Mr. Samuel and John Adams were ſeverally ſpoken of as the ſuppoſed author: I had not, at that time, the pleaſure either of perſonally knowing or being known to the two laſt gentlemen. The favor of Dr. Franklin's friendſhip I poſſeſſed in England, and my introduction to this part of the world was through his patronage. I happened, when a ſchool boy, to pick up a pleaſing natural hiſtory of virginia, and my inclination from that day of ſeeing the weſtern ſide of the Atlantic never left me. In Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſeventy-five, Dr. Franklin propoſed giving me ſuch materials as were in his hands, towards completing a hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the preſent tranſactions, and ſeemed deſirous of having the firſt volume out the next ſpring. I had then formed the outlines of Common Senſe, and finiſhed near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt part; and as I ſuppoſed the Doctor's deſign in getting out a hiſtory, was to open the new year with a new ſyſtem. I expected to ſurpriſe him with a production on that ſubject, much earlier than he thought of; and without informing him of what I was doing, got it ready for the preſs as faſt as I conveniently could, and ent him the firſt pamphlet that was printed off.</note>. Their caution at
this time, was exceedingly miſplaced; for if they
were able to defend their property and maintain their
rights by arms, they conſequently were able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
and ſupport their independence; and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as theſe men ſaw the neceſſity and righteneſs
of the meaſure, they honeſtly and openly declared
and adopted it, and the part they have acted ſince,
has done them honour, and fully eſtabliſhed their
characters. Error in opinion has this peculiar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
with it, that the foremoſt point of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ground may at any time be reached by the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1058401600:89"/>
ſudden exertion of a thought; and it frequently
happens in ſentimental differences that ſome ſtriking
circumſtance, or ſome forcible reaſon, quickly
conceived, will effect in an inſtant what neither ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
nor example could produce in an age.</p>
            <p>I find it impoſſible in the ſmall compaſs I am
limited to, to trace out the progreſs which inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
has made on the minds of the different
claſſes of men, and the ſeveral reaſons by which
they were moved. With ſome, it was a paſſionate
abhorrence againſt the king of England and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
as a ſet of ſavages and brutes; and theſe men
governed by the agony of a wounded mind, were
for truſting every thing to hope and heaven, and
bidding defiance at once. With others, it was a
growing conviction that the ſcheme of the Britiſh
court was to create, ferment and drive on a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
for the ſake of confiſcated plunder: Men of this
caſt ripened into independence in proportion as the
evidence increaſed. While a third claſs concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it was the true intereſt of America, internally
and externally, to be her own maſter, gave their
ſupport to independence, ſtep by ſtep, as they ſaw
her abilities to maintain it enlarge. With many, it
was a compound of all theſe reaſons; while thoſe
who were too callous to be reached by either, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
and ſtill remain tories.</p>
            <p>The legal neceſſity of being independent, with
ſeveral collateral reaſons, is pointed out in an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1058401600:90"/>
maſterly manner, in a charge to the grand
jury for the diſtrict of Charleſtown, by the Hon.
William Henry Drayton, Eſq. chief juſtice of
South-Carolina. This performance, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
of the convention of New-York, are pieces,
in my humble opinion, of the firſt rank in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>The principal cauſes why independence has not
been ſo univerſally ſupported as it ought, are fear
and indolence, and the cauſes why it has been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
are, <hi>avarice, downright villainy,</hi> and <hi>luſt of
perſonal power.</hi> There is not ſuch a being in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
as a tory from conſcience; ſome ſecret defect
or other is interwoven in the character of all thoſe,
be they men or women, who can look with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
on the brutality, luxury and debauchery of
the Britiſh court, and the violations of their army
here. A woman's virtue muſt ſit very lightly on
her, who can even hint a favourable ſentiment in
their behalf. It is remarkable that the whole race
of proſtitutes in New-York were tories; and the
ſchemes for ſupporting the tory cauſe, in this city,
for which ſeveral are now in gaol, and one hanged
were concerted and carried on in common baudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes,
aſſiſted by thoſe who kept them.</p>
            <p>The connection between vice and meanneſs is a
fit object for ſatire, but when the ſatire is a fact, it
cuts with the irreſiſtible power of a diamond. If a
Quaker, in defence of his juſt rights, his property,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1058401600:91"/>
and the chaſtity of his houſe, takes up a muſket,
he is expelled the meeting; but the preſent king
of England, who ſeduced and took into keeping a
ſiſter of their ſociety, is reverenced and ſupported
with repeated teſtimonies, while the friendly noo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
from whom ſhe was taken (and who is now in
this city) continues a drudge in the ſervice of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
as if proud of being cuckolded by a creature
called a king.</p>
            <p>Our ſupport and ſucceſs depend on ſuch a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of men and circumſtances, that every one, who
does but wiſh well, is of ſome uſe: There are men
who have a ſtrange auk wardneſs to arms, yet have
hearts to riſk every ſhilling in the cauſe, or in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of thoſe who have better talents for defending
it. Nature in the arrangement of mankind, has
fitted ſome for every ſervice in life: Were all ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
all would ſtarve and go naked, and were
none ſoldiers, all would be ſlaves. As diſaffection
to independence is the badge of a tory, ſo affection
to it is the mark of a whig; and the different ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of the whigs down from thoſe who nobly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
every thing, to thoſe who have nothing to
render but their wiſhes, tend all to the ſame centre,
though with different degrees of merit and ability.
The larger we make the circle, the more we ſhall
harmonize, and the ſtronger we ſhall be. All we
want to ſhut out, is diſaffection, and, that excluded,
we muſt accept from each other ſuch duties as we
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1058401600:92"/>
are beſt fitted to beſtow. A narrow ſyſtem of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics,
like a narrow ſyſtem of religion is calculated
only to ſour the temper, and live at variance with
mankind.</p>
            <p>All we want to know in America is ſimply this,
who is for independence, and who is not? Thoſe
who are for it will ſupport it, and the remainder
will undoubtedly ſee the reaſonableneſs of their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the charges; while thoſe who oppoſe or ſeek to
betray it muſt expect the more rigid fate of the
gaol and the gibbet. There is a baſtard kind of
generoſity, which, by being extended to all men,
is as fatal to ſociety, on one hand, as the want of
true generoſity is on the other. A lax manner of
adminiſtering juſtice, falſely termed moderation,
has a tendency both to diſpirit public virtue, and
promote the growth of public evils. Had the late
committee of ſafety taken cognizance of the laſt teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
of the Quakers, and proceeded againſt ſuch
delinquents as were concerned therein, they had,
probably prevented the treaſonable plans which have
been concerted ſince. When one villain is ſuffered
to eſcape, it encourages another to proceed, either
from a hope of eſcaping likewiſe, or an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that we dare not puniſh. It has been a matter
of general ſurpriſe, that no notice was taken of the
incendiary publication of the Quakers, of the 20th
of November laſt; a publication evidently intended
to promote ſedition and treaſon, and encourage the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1058401600:93"/>
enemy, who were then within a day's march of this
city, to proceed on and poſſeſs it. I here preſent
the reader with a memorial, which was laid before
the board of ſafety a few days after the teſtimony
appeared. Not a member of that board, that I
converſed with, but expreſſed the higheſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the perverted principles and conduct of the
Quaker junto, and that the board would take the
matter up; notwithſtanding which, it was ſuffered
to paſs away unnoticed, to the encouragement of
new acts of treaſon, the general danger of the
cauſe, and the diſgrace of the ſtate.<q>

ſtate of Pennſylvania.</head>
                           <p>At a meeting of a reputable number of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the city of Philadelphia, impreſſed with a
proper ſenſe of the juſtice of the cauſe which this
continent is engaged in, and animated with a
generous fervor for ſupporting the ſame, it was
reſolved, that the following be laid before the
board of ſafety:</p>
                           <p>"We profeſs liberality of ſentiment to all men;
with this diſtinction only, that thoſe who do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it, would become wiſe and ſeek to deſerve it.
We hold the pure doctrine of univerſal liberty of
conſcience, and conceive it our duty to endeavour
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1058401600:94"/>
to ſecure that ſacred right to others, as well as to
defend it for ourſelves; for we undertake not to
judge of the religious rectitude of tenets, but leave
the whole matter to Him who made us.</p>
                           <p>"We perſecute no man, neither will we abet in
the perſecution of any man for religion ſake; our
common relation to others, being that of fellow
citizens and fellow-ſubjects of one civil community;
and in this line of connection we hold out the right
hand of fellowſhip to all men. But we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ourſelves to be unworthy members of the
FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES OF
AMERICA, were we unconcernedly to ſee or ſuffer
any treaſonable wound, public or private, directly or
indirectly, to be given againſt the peace and ſafety of
the ſame. We enquire not into the rank of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
nor their religious perſuaſion; we have no
buſineſs with either, our part being only to find
them out, and exhibit them to juſtice.</p>
                           <p>"A printed paper, dated the 20th of November,
and ſigned "<hi>John Pemberton,</hi>" whom we ſuppoſe
to be an inhabitant of this city, has lately been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
abroad, a copy of which accompanies this.
Had the framers and publiſhers of that paper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it their duty, to exhort the youth, and others,
of their ſociety, to a patient ſubmiſſion under the
preſent trying viſitations, and humbly to wait the
event of heaven towards them, they had therein
ſhewn a Chriſtian temper, and we had been ſilent;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1058401600:95"/>
but the anger and political virulence with which
their inſtructions are given, and the abuſe with
which they ſtigmatize all ranks of men, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like themſelves, leave no doubt on our minds
from what ſpirit their publication proceeded: And
it is diſgraceful to the pure cauſe of truth, that men
can dally with words of the moſt ſacred import, and
play them as mechanically off, as if religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
only in contrivance. We know of no inſtance
in which the Quakers have been compelled to bear
arms, or do any thing which might ſtrain their
conſcience; wherefore their advice, "to withſtand
and refuſe to admit to the arbitrary inſtructions and
ordinances of men," appear to us a falſe alarm,
and could only be treaſonably calculated to gain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with our enemies, when they were ſeemingly
on the brink of invading this ſtate, or what is ſtill
worſe, to weaken the hands of our defence, that
their entrance into this city might be made practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and eaſy.</p>
                           <p>"We diſclaim all tumult and diſorder in the
puniſhment of offenders; and wiſh to be governed
not by temper but by reaſon, in the manner of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. We are ſenſible that our cauſe has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by the two following errors; firſt, by ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
lenity to traiterous perſons in ſome caſes;
and ſecondly, by only a paſſionate treatment of
them in others. For the future we diſown both,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1058401600:96"/>
and wiſh to be ſteady in our proceedings, and ſerious
in our puniſhments.</p>
                           <p>"Every ſtate in America has by the repeated
voice of its inhabitants, directed and authorized the
continental congreſs to publiſh a formal declaration
of independence of, and ſeparation from, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
king and parliament of great Britain; and
we look on every man an enemy who does not in
ſome line or other give his aſſiſtance towards ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the ſame; at the ſame time we conſider the
offence to be heightened to a degree of unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
guilt, when ſuch perſons, under the ſhew
of religion, endeavour, either by writing, ſpeaking,
or otherwiſe, to ſubvert, overturn, or bring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
upon the independence of this continent, as
declared by congreſs.</p>
                           <p>"The publiſhers of the paper, ſigned "John
Pemberton," have called in a loud and paſſionate
manner on their friends and connections, "to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
and refuſe" obedience to whatever "inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or ordinances" may be publiſhed, not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by (what they call) "that happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
under which they and others long
enjoyed tranquillity and peace." If this be
not treaſon, we know, not what may properly be
called by that name.</p>
                           <p>"To us it is a matter of ſurpriſe and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that men with the word "peace, peace"
continually on their lips, ſhould be ſo fond of living
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1058401600:97"/>
under, and ſupporting a government, and at the
ſame time calling it "happy," which is never bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pleaſed than when at war—that hath filled In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia
with carnage and famine—Africa with ſlavery—
and tampered with Indians and Negroes to cut the
throats of the freemen of America. We conceive
it a diſgrace to this ſtate, to harbour or wink at ſuch
palpable hypocriſy. But as we ſeek not to hurt the
hair of any man's head, when we can make our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſafe without, we wiſh ſuch perſons to reſtore
peace to themſelves and us, by removing themſelves
to ſome part of the king of Great Britain's domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
as by that means they may live unmoleſted
by us, or we by them; for our fixed opinion is, that
thoſe who do not deſerve a place among us, ought
not to have one.</p>
                           <p>"We conclude, with requeſting the council of
ſafety to take into their conſideration the paper
ſigned "John Pemberton; and if it ſhall appear to
them to be of a dangerous tendency, or of a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
nature, that they would commit the ſigner,
together with ſuch other perſons as they can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were concerned therein, into cuſtody, until
ſuch time as ſome mode of trial ſhall aſcertain the
full degree of their guilt and puniſhment; in the
doing of which, we wiſh their judges, whoever
they may be, to diſregard the man, his connections,
intereſt, riches, poverty, or principles of religion,
and to attend to the nature of his offence only."</p>

THE moſt cavilling ſectarian cannot accuſe the
foregoing with containing the leaſt ingredient of
perſecution. The free ſpirit on which the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
cauſe is founded, diſdains to mix with ſuch an
impurity, and leave it a rubbiſh fit only for narrow
and ſuſpicious minds to grovel in: Suſpicion and
perſecution are weeds of the ſame dunghill, and
flouriſh beſt together. Had the Quakers minded
their religion and their buſineſs, they might have
lived through this diſpute in enviable eaſe, and
none would have moleſted them. The common
phraſe with theſe people is, "<hi>Our principles are
peace.</hi>" To which may be replied, <hi>and your prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
are the reverſe</hi>; for never did the conduct of
men oppoſe their own doctrine more notoriouſly
than the preſent race of the Quakers. They have
artfully changed themſelves into a different ſort of
people to what they uſed to be, and yet have the
addreſs to perſuade each other they are not altered;
like antiquated virgins they ſee not the havoc de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
hath made upon them, but pleaſantly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
wrinkles for dimples, conceit themſelves yet
lovely, and wonder at the ſtupid world for not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
them.</p>
            <p>Did no injury ariſe to the public by this apoſtacy
of the Quakers from themſelves, the public would
have nothing to do with it: but as both the deſign
and conſequences are pointed againſt a cauſe in
which the whole community are intereſted, it is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1058401600:99"/>
therefore no longer a ſubject confined to the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of the meeting only, but comes as a matter of
criminality before either the authority of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ſtate <hi>in which</hi> it is acted, or of the continent
<hi>againſt which</hi> it operates. Every attempt now to
ſupport the authority of the king and parliament of
Great Britain over America, is treaſon againſt <hi>every</hi>
ſtate; therefore it is impoſſible that any <hi>one</hi> can
pardon or ſcreen from puniſhment, an offender
againſt <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed: While the infatuated tories of
this and other ſtates were laſt ſpring talking of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
accommodation, making the matter up,
and the Lord knows what ſtuff and nonſenſe, their
<hi>good</hi> king and miniſtry were glutting themſelves
with the revenge of reducing America to <hi>uncondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
ſubmiſſion,</hi> and ſolacing each other with the
certainty of conquering it in <hi>one campaign.</hi> The
following quotations are from the parliamentary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter
of the debates of the houſe of lords, March
5th, 1776.</p>
            <p>"The Americans," ſays Lord <hi>Talbot</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Steward of the king's houſhold.</note> "have
been obſtinate, undutiful and ungovernable from
the very beginning, from their firſt early and infant
ſettlements; and I am every day more and more
convinced that this people will never be brought
back to their duty, and the ſubordinate relation they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1058401600:100"/>
ſtand in to this country, till <hi>reduced to an uncondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
effectual ſubmiſſion</hi>; <hi>no conceſſion on our part,</hi>
               <hi>no lenity, no endurance,</hi> will have any other effect
but that of increaſing their inſolence."</p>
            <p>"The ſtruggle," ſays Lord <hi>Townſend</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Formerly General Townſend at Quebec, and late Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.</note> "is now
a ſtruggle for power; the die is caſt, and the ONLY
POINT which now remains to be determined, is,
in what manner the war can be moſt effectually
proſecuted and ſpeedily finiſhed, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that <hi>unconditional ſubmiſſion,</hi> which has been ſo
able ſtated by the noble Earl with the white ſtaff
(meaning lord Talbot); and I have no reaſon to
doubt that the meaſures now purſuing will put an
end to the war in the courſe of a SINGLE CAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PAIGN.
Should it linger longer, we ſhall then
have reaſon to expect that ſome foreign power will
interfere, and take advantage of our domeſtic trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and civil diſtractions."</p>
            <p>Lord <hi>Littleton.</hi> "My ſentiments are pretty
well known. I ſhall only obſerve now, that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
meaſures have had no other effect than to
produce inſult after inſult; that the more we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded,
the higher America roſe in her demands,
and the more inſolent ſhe has grown. It is for this
reaſon that I am now for the moſt effective and
deciſive meaſures; and am of opinion, that no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1058401600:101"/>
is left us, but to relinquiſh America for
ever, or finally determine to compel her to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the legiſlative authority of this country;
and it is the principle of an <hi>unconditional ſubmiſſion</hi>
I would be for maintaining."</p>
            <p>Can words be more expreſſive than theſe.
Surely the tories will believe the tory lords! The
truth is, they <hi>do believe them,</hi> and know as fully as
any whig on the continent knows, that the king and
miniſtry never had the leaſt deſign of an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
with America, but an abſolute unconditional
conqueſt. And the part which the tories were to
act, was, by downright lying, to endeavour to put
the continent off its guard, and to divide and ſow
diſcontent in the minds of ſuch whigs as they might
gain an influence over. In ſhort, to keep up a
diſtraction here, that the force ſent from England
might be able to conquer in "<hi>one campaign.</hi>"
They and the miniſtry were, by a dsifferent game,
playing into each others hands. The cry of the
tories in England was, "<hi>No reconciliation, no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,</hi>"
in order to obtain the greater military
force; while thoſe in America were crying nothing
but "<hi>reconciliation and accommodation,</hi>" that the
force ſent might conquer with the leſs reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>But <hi>this</hi> "<hi>ſingle campaign</hi>" is over, and America
not conquered. The whole work is yet to do, and
the force much leſs to do it with. Their condition
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1058401600:102"/>
is both deſpicable and deplorable: Out of caſh—out
of heart, and out of hope. A country furniſhed
with arms and ammunition, as America now is,
with three millions of inhabitants, and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
miles diſtant from the neareſt enemy that can
approach her, is able to look and laugh them in the
face.</p>
            <p>Howe appears to have two objects in view,
either to go up the North-river, or come to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia.
By going up the North-river, he ſecures
a retreat for his army through Canada, but the ſhips
muſt return if they return at all, the ſame way they
went; and as our army would be in the rear, the
ſafety of their paſſage down is a doubtful matter.
By ſuch a motion, he ſhuts himſelf from all ſupplies
from Europe, but through Canada, and expoſes
his army and navy to the danger of periſhing. The
idea of his cutting off the communication between
the eaſtern and ſouthern ſtates, by means of the
North-river, is merely viſionary. He cannot do it
by his ſhipping; becauſe no ſhip can lay long at
anchor in any river within reach of the ſhore; a
ſingle gun would drive a firſt rate from ſuch a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This was fully proved laſt October, at fort
Waſhington and Lee, where one gun only, on each
ſide the river, obliged two frigates to cut and be
towed off in an hour's time. Neither can he cut it
off by his army; becauſe the ſeveral poſts they
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1058401600:103"/>
muſt occupy, would divide them almoſt to nothing,
and expoſe them to be picked up by ours like peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
on a river's bank; but admitting he could,
where is the injury? Becauſe while his whole
force is cantoned out, as centries over the water,
they will be very innocently employed, and the
moment they march into the country, the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
opens.</p>
            <p>The moſt probable object is Philadelphia, and
the reaſons are many. Howe's buſineſs in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica
is to conquer it, and in proportion as he finds
himſelf unable to the taſk, he will employ his
ſtrength to diſtreſs women and weak minds, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to accompliſh through <hi>their</hi> fears, what he
cannot effect by his <hi>own</hi> force. His coming, or
attempting to come to Philadelphia, is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that proves his weakneſs: For no general,
that felt himſelf able to take the field and attack his
antagoniſt, would think of bringing his army into a
city in the ſummer time; and this mere ſhifting
the ſcene from place to place, without effecting any
thing, has feebleneſs and cowardice on the face of
it, and holds him up in a contemptible light to any
one who can reaſon juſtly and firmly. By ſeveral
informations from New York, it appears that their
army in general, both officers and men, have given
up the expectation of conquering America; their
eye now is fixt upon the ſpoil. They ſuppoſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1058401600:104"/>
to be rich with ſtores, and as they think
to get more by robbing a town, than by attacking
an army, their movement towards this city is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
We are not now contending againſt an
army of ſoldiers, but againſt a band of thieves, who
had rather plunder than fight, and have no other
hope of conqueſt than by cruelty.</p>
            <p>They expect to get a mighty booty and ſtrike
another general panic by making a ſudden move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and getting poſſeſſion of this city, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they can march <hi>out</hi> as well as <hi>in,</hi> or get the
entire command of the river, to remove off their
plunder, they may probably be ſtopt with the ſtolen
goods upon them. They have never yet ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
wherever they have been oppoſed but at
fort Waſhington. At Charleſton their defeat was
effectual. At Ticonderoga they ran away. In
every ſkirmiſh at Kingſbridge and the White-Plains
they were obliged to retreat, and the inſtant
our arms were turned upon them in the Jerſeys,
they turned likewiſe, and thoſe that turned not
were taken.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity of always fitting our internal police
to the circumſtances of the times we live in, is
ſomething ſo ſtrikingly obvious, that no ſufficient
objection can be made againſt it. The ſafety of all
ſocieties depend upon it; and where this point is
not attended to, the conſequences will either be a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1058401600:105"/>
general languor or a tumult. The encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and protection of the good ſubjects of any
ſtate, and the ſuppreſſion and puniſhment of bad
ones, are the principal objects for which all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is inſtituted, and the line in which it ought
to operate. We have in this city a ſtrange variety
of men and characters, and the circumſtances of
the times require they ſhould be publicly known;
it is not the number of tories that hurt us, ſo much
as the not finding out who they are; men muſt
now take one ſide or the other, and abide by the
conſequences: The quakers, truſting to their ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted
ſagacity, have, moſt unluckily for them,
made their declaration in their laſt teſtimony, and
we ought <hi>now</hi> to take them at their word. They
have voluntarily read themſelves out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental
meeting, and cannot hope to be reſtored
to it again, but by payment and penitence. Men
whoſe political principles are founded on avarice,
are beyond the reach of reaſon, and the only cure
of toryiſm of this caſt, is to tax it. A ſubſtantial
good drawn from a real evil, is of the ſame benefit
to ſociety, as if drawn from a virtue; and where
men have not public ſpirit to render themſelves ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,
it ought to be the ſtudy of government
to draw the beſt uſe poſſible from their vices. When
the governing paſſion of any man or ſet of men is
once known, the method of managing them is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1058401600:106"/>
eaſy; for even miſers, whom no public virtue can
impreſs, would become generous, could a heavy
tax be laid upon covetouſneſs.</p>
            <p>The tories have endeavoured to inſure their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
with the enemy, by forfeiting their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with us; from which may be juſtly inferred,
that their governing paſſion is avarice. Make them
as much afraid of loſing on one ſide as the other,
and you ſtagger their toryiſm; make them more
ſo, and you reclaim them; for their principle is to
worſhip any power they are moſt afraid of.</p>
            <p>This method of conſidering men and things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
opens into a large field for ſpeculation, and
affords me opportunity of offering ſome obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on the ſtate of our currency, ſo as to make the
ſupport of it go hand in hand with the ſuppreſſion
of diſaffection, and the encouragement of public
ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The thing which firſt preſents itſelf in inſpecting
the ſtate of the currency is, that we have too much
of it, and that there is a neceſſity of reducing the
quantity, in order to increaſe the value. Men are
daily growing poor by the very means they take to
get rich, for in the ſame proportion that the prices
of all goods on hand are raiſed, the value of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
laid by, is reduced. A ſimple caſe will make
this clear: Let a man have one hundred pounds
caſh, and as many goods on hand as will to-day ſell
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1058401600:107"/>
for 20l. but not content with the preſent market
price, he raiſes them to 40, and by ſo doing, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
others in their own defence to raiſe cent per
cent likewiſe; in this caſe, it is evident that his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds laid by is reduced fifty pounds in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue;
whereas, had the markets dropt cent per cent,
his goods would have ſold but for ten, but his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
pounds would have riſen in value to two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;
becauſe it would then purchaſe as many goods
again, or ſupport his family as long again as before.
And ſtrange as it may ſeem, he is one hundred and
fifty pounds the poorer for raiſing his goods, to
what he would have been had he lowered them;
becauſe the forty pounds his goods ſold for, is by
the general riſe of the markets, cent per cent, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of no more value than the ten pounds would
be, had the market fallen in the ſame proportion:
and conſequently the whole difference of gain or loſs
is on the different values of the hundred pounds
laid by, viz. from fifty to two hundred. This rage
for raiſing goods is, for ſeveral reaſons, much more
the fault of the tories than the whigs; and yet the
tories (to their ſhame and confuſion ought they to
be told of it) are by far the moſt noiſy and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.
The greateſt part of the whigs, by being
now either in the army, or employed in ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
ſervice, are <hi>buyers</hi> only, and not <hi>ſellers</hi>; and as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1058401600:108"/>
this evil has its origin in trade, it cannot be charged
on thoſe who are out of it.</p>
            <p>But the grievance is now become too general to
be remedied by partial methods, and the only effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
cure is to reduce the quantity of money; with
half the quantity we ſhould be richer than we are
now, becauſe the value of it would be doubled, and
conſequently our attachment to it increaſed; for it
is not the number of dollars a man has, but how far
they will go, that makes him either rich or poor.</p>
            <p>Theſe two points being admitted, viz. that the
quantity of money is too great, and that the prices
of goods can be only effectually reduced by redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the quantity of the money; the next point to be
conſidered is, the method how to reduce it?</p>
            <p>The circumſtances of the times, as before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
require that the public characters of all men
ſhould <hi>now</hi> be fully underſtood, and the only gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
method of aſcertaining it, is by an oath or affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
renouncing all allegiance to the king of
Great Britain, and to ſupport the independency of
the United States, as declared by Congreſs. Let,
at the ſame time, a tax of ten, fifteen or twenty per
cent per annum, to be collected quarterly, be levied
on all property. Theſe alternatives, by being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
voluntary, will take in all ſorts of people.
Here is the teſt; here is the tax. He who takes
the former, conſcientiouſly proves his affection to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1058401600:109"/>
the cauſe, and binds himſelf to pay his quota by
the beſt <hi>ſervices</hi> in his power, and is thereby juſtly
exempt from the latter; and thoſe who chuſe the
latter, pay their quota in money, to be excuſed
from taking the former, or rather 'tis the price
paid to us for their ſuppoſed, though miſtaken
inſurance with the enemy.</p>
            <p>But this is only a part of the advantage which
would ariſe by knowing the different characters of
men. The whigs ſtake every thing on the iſſue of
their arms, while the tories, by their diſaffection,
are ſapping and undermining their ſtrength, and,
of conſequence, the property of the whigs is the
more expoſed thereby; and whatever injury their
eſtates may ſuſtain by the movements of the enemy,
muſt either be borne by themſelves, who have done
every thing which has <hi>yet</hi> been done, or by the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
who have not only done nothing, but have, by
their diſaffection, invited the enemy on.</p>
            <p>In the preſent criſis, we ought to know ſquare by
ſquare, and houſe by houſe, who are in real allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the United Independent States, and who
are not. Let but the line be made clear and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
and all men will then know what they are to
truſt to. It would not only be good policy, but
ſtrict juſtice, to raiſe fifty or a hundred thouſand
pounds, or more, if it is neceſſary, out of the eſtates
and property of the king of England's votaries, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1058401600:110"/>
in Philadelphia, to be diſtributed, as a reward
to thoſe inhabitants of the city and ſtate, who ſhould
turn out and repulſe the enemy, ſhould they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
their march this way; and likewiſe, to bind
the property of all ſuch perſons to make good the
damages which that of the whigs might ſuſtain. In
the undiſtinguiſhable mode of conducting a war, we
frequently make repriſals at ſea, on the veſſels of
perſons in England who are friends to our cauſe,
compared with the reſidentary tories among us.</p>
            <p>In every former publication of mine, from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe down to the laſt Criſis, I have generally
gone on the charitable ſuppoſition, that the tories
were rather a miſtaken than a criminal people, and
have applied argument after argument with all the
candor and temper I was capable of, in order to ſet
every part of the caſe clearly and fairly before them,
and if poſſible, to reclaim them from ruin to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
I have done my duty by them, and have
now done with that doctrine, taking it for granted,
that thoſe who yet hold their diſaffection, are either
a ſet of avaricious miſcreants, who would ſacrifice
the continent to ſave themſelves, or a banditti of
hungry traitors, who are hoping for a diviſion of the
ſpoil. To which may be added, a liſt of crown
or proprietary dependants, who, rather than go
without a portion of power, would be content to
ſhare it with the devil. Of ſuch men there is no
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1058401600:111"/>
hope; and their obedience will only be according
to the danger that is ſet before them, and the power
that is exerciſed over them.</p>
            <p>A time will ſhortly arrive, in which by aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the characters of perſons now, we ſhall be
guarded againſt their miſchiefs then; ſo in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
as the enemy deſpair of conqueſt, they
will be trying the arts of ſeduction and the force
of fear, by all the miſchiefs they can inflict. But in
war we may be certain of theſe two things, viz.
that cruelty in an enemy, and motions made with
more than uſual parade, are always ſigns of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
He that can conquer, finds his mind too free
and pleaſant to be brutiſh; and he that intends to
conquer, never makes too much ſhow of his
ſtrength.</p>
            <p>We now know the enemy we have to do with.
While drunk with the certainty of victory, they
diſdained to be civil; and in proportion as diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
makes them ſober, and their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of an European war alarm them, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
cringing and artful; honeſt they cannot be.</p>
            <p>But our anſwer to them, in either condition they
may be in, is ſhort and full, "As free and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
ſtates, we are willing to make peace with
you to-morrow, but we can neither hear nor reply
in any other character."</p>

If Britain cannot conquer us, it proves, that ſhe
is neither able to govern or protect us, and our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſituation now is ſuch, that any connexion
with her would be unwiſely exchanging a half de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated

            <head type="sub">
               <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Sept. 12, 1777.</head>
            <p>THOSE who expect to reap the bleſſings of
freedom, muſt, like men, undergo the fatigues of
ſupporting it. The event of Yeſterday is one of
thoſe kind of alarms which is juſt ſufficient to rouſe
us to duty, without being of conſequence enough
to depreſs our fortitude. It is not a field of a few
acres of ground, but a cauſe we are defending, and
whether we defeat the enemy in one battle, or by
degrees, the conſequence will be the ſame.</p>
            <p>Look back at the events of laſt winter and the
preſent year; there you will find that the enemy's
ſucceſſes have always contributed to reduce them.
What they have gained in ground, they paid ſo
dearly for in numbers, that their victories have in
the end amounted to defeats. We have always
been maſters at the laſt puſh, and always ſhall, while
we do our duty. Howe has been once on the
banks of the Delaware, and from thence driven
back with loſs and diſgrace; and why not be again
driven from the Schuylkill? His condition and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1058401600:114"/>
ours are very different. He has every body to
fight, we have only his <hi>one</hi> army to cope with,
and which waſtes away at every engagement; we
can not only reinforce, but can redouble our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
he is cut off from all ſupplies, and muſt ſooner
or later inevitably fall into our hands.</p>
            <p>Shall a band of ten or twelve thouſand robbers,
who are this day fifteen hundred or two thouſand
men leſs in ſtrength than they were yeſterday, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
America, or ſubdue even a ſingle ſtate? The
thing cannot be, unleſs we ſit down and ſuffer them
to do it. Another ſuch a bruſh, notwithſtanding
we loſt the ground, would, by ſtill reducing the
enemy, put them in a condition to be afterwards
totally defeated.</p>
            <p>Could our whole army have come up to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
at one time, the conſequences had probably
been otherwiſe; but our having different parts of
the Brandywine-creek to guard, and the uncertainty
which road to Philadelphia the enemy would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to take, naturally afforded them an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of paſſing with their main body at a place
where only a part of ours could be poſted; for it
muſt ſtrike every thinking man with conviction,
that it requires a much greater force to oppoſe an
enemy in ſeveral places, than is ſufficient to defeat
in any one place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:1058401600:115"/>
Men who are ſincere in defending their freedom,
will always feel concern at every circumſtance
which ſeems to make againſt them; it is the natural
and honeſt conſequence of all affectionate attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the want of it is a vice. But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
laſts only for a moment; they ſoon riſe out
of it with additional vigour; the glow of hope,
courage and fortitude, will, in a little time ſupply
the place of every inferior paſſion, and kindle the
whole heart into heroiſm.</p>
            <p>There is a myſtery in the countenance of ſome
cauſes, which we have not always preſent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough to explain. It is diſtreſſing to ſee an
enemy advancing into a country, but it is the only
place in which we can beat them, and in which we
have always beaten them, whenever they made the
attempt. The nearer any diſeaſe approaches to
a criſis, the nearer it is to a cure. Danger and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
make their advances together, and it is
only the laſt puſh, that one or the other takes the
lead.</p>
            <p>There are many men who will do their duty
when it is not wanted; but a genuine public ſpirit
always appear moſt, when there is moſt occaſion for
it. Thank God! our army, though fatigued, is yet
entire. The attack made by us yeſterday, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
many diſadvantages, naturally ariſing from the
uncertainty of knowing which route the enemy
would take; and from that circumſtance, the whole
of our force could not be brought up together
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1058401600:116"/>
time enough to engage all at once. Our ſtrength
is yet reſerved; and it is evident that Howe does
not think himſelf a gainer by the affair, otherwiſe
he would this morning have moved down and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked
General Waſhington.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen of the city and country, it is in your
power, by a ſpirited improvement of the preſent
circumſtance, to turn it to a real advantage. Howe
is now weaker than before, and every ſhot will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to reduce him. You are more immediately
intereſted than any other part of the continent;
your all is at a ſtake; it is not ſo with the general
cauſe; you are devoted by the enemy to plunder
and deſtruction: It is the encouragement which
Howe, the chief of plunderers, has promiſed his
army. Thus circumſtanced, you may ſave your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by a manly reſiſtance, but you can have no
hope in any other conduct. I never yet knew our
brave general, or any part of the army, officers or
men, out of heart, and I have ſeen them in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
a thouſand times more trying than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
It is only thoſe that are not in action, that
feel languor and heavineſs, and the beſt way to rub
it off, is to turn out, and make ſure work of it.</p>
            <p>Our army muſt undoubtedly feel fatigue, and
want a reinforcement of reſt, though not of valour.
Our own intereſt and happineſs call upon us to give
them every ſupport in our power, and make the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1058401600:117"/>
burden of the day, on which the ſafety of this city
depends, light as poſſible. Remember, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that we have forces both to the northward
and ſouthward of Philadelphia, and if the enemy be
but ſtopt till thoſe can arrive, this city will be ſaved,
and the enemy finally routed. You have too
much at ſtake to heſitate. You ought not to think
an hour on the matter, but to ſpring to action at
once. Other ſtates have been invaded, have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
driven off the invaders. Now our time
and turn is come, and perhaps the finiſhing
ſtroke is reſerved for us. When we look back on
the dangers we have been ſaved from, and reflect
on the ſucceſs we have been bleſſed with, it would
be ſinful either to be idle or deſpair.</p>
            <p>I cloſe this paper with a ſhort addreſs to General
Howe. You, ſir, are only lingering out the period
that ſhall bring with it your defeat. You have
yet ſcarce began upon the war, and the farther you
enter, the faſter will your troubles thicken. What
you now enjoy is only a reſpite from ruin; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
to deſtruction: ſomething that will lead
on to our deliverance at your expence. We know
the cauſe we are engaged in, and though a paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
fondneſs for it may make us grieve at every
injury that threatens it, yet, when the moment of
concern is over, the determination to duty returns.
We are not moved by the gloomy ſmile of a worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1058401600:118"/>
king, but by the ardent glow of generous
patriotiſm. We fight not to enſlave, but to ſet a
country free, and to make room upon the earth for
honeſt men to live in. In ſuch a cauſe, we are
ſure we are right; and we leave to you, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing
reflection of being the tool of a miſerable
tyrant.</p>

               <head>To General Sir William Howe.</head>
               <p>TO argue with a man who has renounced the
uſe and authority of reaſon, and whoſe philoſophy
conſiſts in holding humanity in contempt, is like
adminiſtering medicines to the dead, or endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to convert an atheiſt by ſcripture. Enjoy, ſir,
your inſenſibility of feeling and reflecting. It is
the prerogative of animals. And no man will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
you thoſe honours, in which a ſavage only can
be your rival, and a bear your maſter.</p>
               <p>As the generoſity of this country, rewarded your
brother's ſervices laſt war with an elegant monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Weſtminſter Abbey, it is conſiſtent that
ſhe ſhould beſtow ſome mark of diſtinction upon
you. You certainly deſerve her notice, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
place in the catalogue of extraordinary
perſons. Yet it would be a pity to paſs you from
the world in ſtate, and conſign you to magnificent
oblivion among the tombs, without telling the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1058401600:120"/>
beholder why. Judas is as much known as
John, yet hiſtory aſcribes their fame to very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
actions.</p>
               <p>Sir William hath undoubtedly merited a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But of what kind? or of what inſcription?
where placed? or how embelliſhed? is a queſtion
that would puzzle all the heralds of St. James's, in
the profoundeſt mood of hiſtorical deliberation.
We are at no loſs, ſir, to aſcertain your real charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but ſomewhat perplexed how to perpetuate its
identity, and preſerve it uninjured from the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
of time or miſtake. A ſtatuary may
give a falſe expreſſion to your buſt, or decorate
it with ſome equivocal emblems, by which you may
happen to ſteal into reputation, and impoſe upon
the hereafter traditionary world. Ill nature, or
ridicule may conſpire, or a variety of accidents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
to leſſen, enlarge or change Sir William's
fame; and no doubt, but he who has taken ſo much
pains to be ſingular in his conduct, would chooſe
to be as ſingular in his exit, his monument and his
epitaph.</p>
               <p>The uſual honours of the dead, to be ſure, are
not ſufficiently ſublime to eſcort a character like
you to the republic of duſt and aſhes; for however
men may differ in their ideas of grandeur or
government here, the grave is nevertheleſs a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
republic. Death is not the monarch of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1058401600:121"/>
dead, but of the dying. The moment he obtains
a conqueſt, he loſes a ſubject, and, like the fooliſh
king you ſerve, will, in the end, war himſelf out of
all dominion.</p>
               <p>As a proper preliminary towards the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of your funeral honours, we readily admit
your new rank of <hi>knighthood.</hi> The title is perfectly
in character, and is your own, more by merit than
creation. There are knights of various orders
from the knight of the windmill, to the knight of
the poſt. The former is your patron for exploits,
and the latter will aſſiſt you in ſettling your accounts.
No honourary title could be more happily applied!
The ingenuity is ſublime! And your royal maſter
hath diſcovered more genius in fitting you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
than in generating the moſt finiſhed figure
for a button, or deſcanting on the properties of a
button mould.</p>
               <p>But how, ſir, ſhall we diſpoſe of you? The
invention of a ſtatuary is exhauſted, and Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
is yet unprovided with a monument. America
is anxious to beſtow her funeral favours upon you,
and wiſhes to do it in a manner that ſhall diſtinguiſh
you from all the deceaſed heroes of the laſt war.
The <hi>Egyptian method of embalming</hi> is not known
to the preſent age, and hieroglyphical pageantry
hath out lived the ſcience of decyphering it. Some
other method, therefore, muſt be thought of to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1058401600:122"/>
immortalize the new knight of the windmill and
poſt. Sir William, thanks to his ſtars, is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with very delicate ideas. He has no am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of being wrapt up and handed about in
myrrh, aloes, and caſſia. Leſs chargeable odours
will ſuffice; and it fortunately happens, that the
ſimple genius of America, hath diſcovered the art
of preſerving bodies, and embelliſhing them too,
with much greater frugality than the ancients. In
a balmage, ſir, of humble tar, you will be as ſecure
as Pharoah, and in a hieroglyphic of feathers, rival
in finery all the mummies of Egypt.</p>
               <p>As you have already made your exit from the
moral world, and by numberleſs acts both of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
and deliberate injuſtice engraved an "<hi>Here
Lyeth</hi>" on your deceaſed honour, it muſt be mere
affectation in you to pretend concern at the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
or opinions of mankind reſpecting you.
What remains of you may expire at any time.
The ſooner the better. For he who ſurvives his
reputation, lives out of ſpite to himſelf like a man
liſtening to his own reproach.</p>
               <p>Thus entombed and ornamented I leave you to
the inſpection of the curious, and return to the
hiſtory of your yet ſurviving actions.—The
character of Sir William hath undergone ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
revolutions ſince his arrival in America.
It is now fixed and known; and we have nothing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1058401600:123"/>
to hope from your candour or to fear from your
capacity. Indolence and inability have too large
a ſhare in your compoſition ever to ſuffer you to
be any thing more than the hero of little villanies
and unfiniſhed adventures. That, which to ſome
perſons appeared moderation in you at firſt, was
not produced by any real virtue of your own, but
by a contraſt of paſſions dividing and holding you
in perpetual irreſolution. One vice will frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expel another without the leaſt merit in the man,
as powers in contrary directions reduce each other
to reſt.</p>
               <p>It became you to have ſupported a dignified
ſolemnity of character; to have ſhewn a ſuperior
liberality of ſoul; to have won reſpect by an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
perſeverance in maintaining order, and to
have exhibited on all occaſions, ſuch an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
graciouſneſs of conduct, that while we beheld
in you the reſolution of an enemy, we might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
in you the ſincerity of a man. You came to
America under the high ſounding titles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
and commiſſioner; not only to ſuppreſs
what you called rebellion by arms, but to ſhame it
out of countenance by the excellence of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
Inſtead of which, you have been the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
of low and vulgar frauds, the encourager of
Indian cruelties, and have imported a cargo of
vices blacker than thoſe you pretend to ſuppreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:1058401600:124"/>
Mankind are not univerſally agreed in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of right and wrong; but there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
actions which the conſent of all nations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals
hath branded with the unchangeable name
of MEANNESS. In the liſt of human vices we
find ſome of ſuch a refined conſtitution, that they
cannot be carried into practice without ſeducing
ſome virtue to their aſſiſtance; but <hi>meanneſs</hi> hath
neither alliance nor apology. It is generated in
the duſt and ſweepings of other vices, and is of
ſuch a hateful figure that all the reſt conſpire to
diſown it. Sir William, the commiſſioner of
George the Third, hath at laſt vouchſafed to give
it rank and pedigree. He has placed the fugitive
at the council board, and dubbed it companion of
the order of knighthood.</p>
               <p>The particular act of meanneſs which I allude to
in this deſcription, is forgery. You, ſir, have abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and patronized the forging and uttering counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
continental bills. In the ſame New-York
newſpapers in which your own proclamation under
your maſter's authority was publiſhed, offering, or
pretending to offer, pardon and protection to the
inhabitants of theſe ſtates, there were repeated ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements
of counterfeit money for ſale, and
perſons who have come officially from you and
under ſanction of your flag, have been taken up in
attempting to put them off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1058401600:125"/>
A conduct ſo baſely mean in a public character
is without precedent or pretence. Every nation on
earth, whether friends or enemies, will unite in
deſpiſing you. 'Tis an incendiary war upon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
which nothing can excuſe or palliate—An
improvement upon beggarly villany—and ſhews an
inbred wretchedneſs of heart made up between the
venomous malignity of a ſerpent and the ſpiteful
imbecility of an inferior reptile.</p>
               <p>The laws of any civilized country would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
you to the gibbet without regard to your
rank or titles, becauſe it is an action foreign to the
uſage and cuſtom of war; and ſhould you fall into
our hands, which pray God you may, it will be a
doubtful matter whether we are to conſider you as
a military priſoner or a priſoner for felony.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is exceedingly unwiſe and impolitic in
you, or any perſons in the Engliſh ſervice, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
or even encourage, or wink, at the crime
of forgery in any caſe whatever. Becauſe, as the
riches of England, as a nation, are chiefly in paper,
and the far greater part of trade among individuals
is carried on by the ſame medium, that is, by notes
and drafts on one another, they, therefore, of all
people in the world ought to endeavour to keep
forgery out of ſight, and, if poſſible, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
the idea of it. It is dangerous to make men
familiar with a crime which they may afterwards
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1058401600:126"/>
practiſe to much greater advantage againſt thoſe
who firſt taught them. Several officers in the
Engliſh army have made their exit at the gallows
for forgery on their agents; for we all know, who
know any thing of England, that there is not a
more neceſſitous body of men, taking them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
than what the Engliſh officers are. They
contrive to make a ſhew at the expence of the
taylor, and appear clean at the charge of the
waſher-woman.</p>
               <p>England hath at this time nearly two hundred
million pounds ſterling of public money in paper,
for which ſhe hath no real property, beſides a large
circulation of bank notes, bank poſt bills, and
promiſſory notes and drafts of private bankers,
merchants, and tradeſmen. She hath the greateſt
quantity of paper currency and the leaſt quantity of
gold and ſilver of any nation in Europe; the real
ſpecie, which is about ſixteen millions ſterling,
ſerve only as change in large ſums, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
made in paper, or for payment in ſmall ones.
Thus circumſtanced, the nation is put to its wit's
end, and obliged to be ſevere almoſt to criminality,
to prevent the practice and growth of forgery.
Scarcely a ſeſſion paſſes at the Old Bailey, or an
execution at Tyburn, but witneſſeth this truth. Yet
you, ſir, regardleſs of the policy which her neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
obliges her to adopt, have made your whole
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1058401600:127"/>
army intimate with the crime. And as all armies,
at the concluſion of a war, are too apt to carry into
practice the vices of the campaign, it will probably
happen, that England will hereafter abound in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries,
to which art, the practitioners were firſt
initiated under your authority in America. You,
ſir, have the honour of adding a new vice to the
military catalogue; and the reaſon, perhaps, why
the invention was reſerved for you is, becauſe no
general before was mean enough even to think
of it.</p>
               <p>That a man whoſe ſoul is abſorbed in the low
traffic of vulgar vice, is incapable of moving in any
ſuperior region, is clearly ſhewn in you by the
event of every campaign. Your military exploits
have been without plan, object or deciſion. Can
it be poſſible that you or your employers can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the poſſeſſion of Philadelphia to be any ways
equal to the expence or expectation of the nation
which ſupports you? What advantages does En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
derive from any achievements of yours? To
<hi>her</hi> it is perfectly indifferent what place you are in,
ſo long as the buſineſs of conqueſt is unperformed,
and the charge of maintaining you remains the
ſame.</p>
               <p>If the principal events of the three campaigns be
attended to, the balance will appear ſtrongly againſt
you at the cloſe of each; but the laſt, in point of
importance to us, hath exceeded the former two.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1058401600:128"/>
It is pleaſant to look back on dangers paſt, and
equally as pleaſant to meditate on preſent ones,
when the way out begins to appear. <hi>That</hi> period is
now arrived, and the long doubtful winter of war is
changing to the ſweeter proſpects of victory and
joy. At the cloſe of the campaign in ſeventy-five,
you were obliged to retreat from Boſton. In the
ſummer of ſeventy-ſix, you appeared with a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fleet and army in the harbour of New York.
By what miracle the Continent was preſerved in
that ſeaſon of danger is a ſubject of admiration!
If inſtead of waſting your time againſt Long Iſland,
you had run up the North River, and landed any
where above New York, the conſequence muſt
have been, that either you would have compelled
General Waſhington to fight you with very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
numbers, or he muſt have ſuddenly evacuated
the city, with the loſs of nearly all the ſtores of the
army, or have ſurrendered for the want of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
the ſituation of the place naturally producing
one or other of theſe events.</p>
               <p>The preparations made to defend New York,
were, nevertheleſs, wiſe and military; becauſe
your forces were then at ſea, their numbers uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
ſtorms, ſickneſs, or variety of accidents might
have diſabled their coming, or ſo diminiſhed them
on their paſſage, that thoſe which ſurvived, would
have been incapable of opening the campaign with
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1058401600:129"/>
any proſpect of ſucceſs; in which caſe, the defence
would have been ſufficient, and the place preſerved;
for cities that have been raiſed from nothing with
an infinitude of labour and expence, are not to be
thrown away on the bear probability of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken. On theſe grounds, the preparations
made to maintain New York were as judicious as
the retreat afterwards. While you, in the interim,
let ſlip the <hi>very</hi> opportunity, which ſeemed to put
conqueſt in your power.</p>
               <p>Through the whole of that campaign you had
nearly double the forces which General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
immediately commanded. The principal
plan, at that time, on our part, was to wear away
the ſeaſon with as little loſs as poſſible, and to raiſe
the army for the next year. Long-Iſland, New-York,
Forts Waſhington and Lee, were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
after your ſuperior force was known, under
any expectation of their being finally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
but as a range of out works, in the attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which, your time might be waſted, your num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
reduced, and your vanity amuſed by poſſeſſing
them on our retreat. It was intended to have
withdrawn the garriſon from Fort Waſhington,
after it had anſwered the former of thoſe purpoſes,
but the fate of that day put a prize into your hands
without much honour to yourſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:1058401600:130"/>
Your progreſs through the Jerſesy, was accidental;
you had it not even in contemplation, or you would
not have ſent ſo principal a part of your force to
Rhode Iſland before hand. The utmoſt hope
of America in the year ſeventy ſix reached no
higher than that ſhe might not <hi>then</hi> be conquered.
She had no expectation of defeating you in that
campaign. Even the moſt cowardly tory allowed,
that, could ſhe withſtand the ſhock of <hi>that</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
her independence would be paſt a doubt. You
had <hi>then</hi> greatly the advantage of her. You were
formidable. Your military knowledge was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be complete. Your fleets and forces
arrived without an accident. You had neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
nor reinforcements to wait for. You had
nothing to do but to begin, and your chance lay in
the firſt vigorous onſet,</p>
               <p>America was young and unſkilled. She was
obliged to truſt her defence to time and practice;
and hath, by mere dint of perſeverance, maintained
her cauſe, and brought her enemy to a condition,
in which, ſhe is now capable of meeting him on
any grounds.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable in the campaign of ſeventy-ſix,
you gained no more notwithſtanding your great
force, than what was given you by conſent of
evacuation, except Fort Waſhington: while every
advantage obtained by us, was by fair and hard
fighting. The defeat of Sir Peter Parker was
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1058401600:131"/>
complete. The conqueſt of the Heſſians at Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
by the remains of a retreating army, which but
a few days before, you affected to deſpiſe, is an
inſtance of heroic perſeverance, very ſeldom to be
met with. And the victory over the Britiſh troops
at Princetown, by a harraſſed and wearied party,
who had been engaged the day before, and marched
all night without refreſhment, is attended with ſuch
a ſcene of circumſtances and ſuperiority of general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
as will ever give it a place on the firſt line in
the hiſtory of great actions.</p>
               <p>When I look back on the gloomy days of laſt
winter, and ſee America ſuſpended by a thread, I
feel a triumph of joy at the recollection of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,
and a reverence for the characters which
ſnatched her from deſtruction. To doubt <hi>now,</hi>
would be a ſpecies of infidelity, and to forget the
inſtruments which ſaved us <hi>then,</hi> would be ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>The cloſe of that campaign, left us with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of conquerors. The northern diſtricts were
relieved by the retreat of General Carleton over
the lakes. The army under your command were
hunted back, and had their bounds preſcribed. The
Continent began to feel its military importance,
and the winter paſſed pleaſantly away in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the next campaign.</p>
               <p>However confident you might be on your firſt
arrival, the courſe of the year ſeventy ſix, gave
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1058401600:132"/>
you ſome idea of the difficulty, if not impoſſibility
of conqueſt. To this reaſon, I aſcribe your delay
in opening the campaign in ſeventy ſeven. The
face of matters, on the cloſe of the ſormer year,
gave you no encouragement to purſue a diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
war as ſoon as the ſpring admitted the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the field: for, though conqueſt in that caſe,
would have given you a double portion of fame,
yet the experiment was too hazardous. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
had you ſailed, would have ſhifted the whole
blame upon you, charged you with having acted
without orders, and condemned at once, both your
plan and execution.</p>
               <p>To avoid thoſe misfortunes, which might have
involved you, and your money accounts in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity,
and ſuſpicion, you prudently waited the
arrival of a plan of operations from England,
which was, that you ſhould proceed to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia
by the way of Cheſapeak, and that Burgoyne,
after reducing Ticonderoga, ſhould take his route
by Albany, and, if neceſſary, join you.</p>
               <p>The ſplendid laurels of laſt campaign have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
in the north. In that quarter America hath
ſurprized the world, and laid the foundation of her
this year's glory. The conqueſt of Ticonderoga
(if it may be called a conqueſt) has, like all your
other victories, led on to ruin. Even the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
taken in that fortreſs, (which by General Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne's
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1058401600:133"/>
return was ſufficent in bread and flour for
nearly 5000 men, for ten weeks, and in beef and
pork for the ſame number of men for one month)
ſerved only to haſten his overthrow, by enabling
him to proceed for Saratoga, the place of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
A ſhort review of the operations of the
laſt campaign, will ſhew the condition of affairs on
both ſides.</p>
               <p>You have taken Ticonderoga, and marched into
Philadelphia. Theſe are all the events which the
year hath produced on your part. A trifling cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
indeed, compared with the expences of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and the conqueſt of the continent. On the
other ſide, a conſiderable part of your northern
force has been routed by the New York militia,
under General Herkemer. Fort Stanwix hath
bravely ſurvived a compounded attack of ſoldiers
and ſavages, and the beſiegers have fled. The
battle of Bennington has put a thouſand priſoners
into our hands, with all their arms, ſtores, artillery
and baggage. General Burgoyne in two engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
has been defeated; himſelf, his army, and all
that were his and theirs are now ours. Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga
and Independence are retaken, and not the
ſhadow of an enemy remains in all the northern
diſtricts. At this inſtant, we have upwards of
eleven thouſand priſoners, between ſixty and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
pieces of braſs ordnance, beſides ſmall arms,
tents, ſtores, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:1058401600:134"/>
In order to know the real value of thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we muſt reverſe the ſcene, and ſuppoſe
General Gates and the force he commanded, to be
at your mercy as priſoners, and General Burgoyne
with his army of ſoldiers and ſavages to be already
joined to you in Penſylvania. So diſmal a picture,
can ſcarcely be looked at. It hath all the traces and
colourings of horror and deſpair, and excites the
moſt ſwelling emotions of gratitude, by exhibiting
the miſeries we are ſo graciouſly preſerved from.</p>
               <p>I admire this diſtribution of laurels around the
continent. It is the earneſt of future union. South
Carolina has had her day of ſuffering and of fame;
and the other ſouthern ſtates have exerted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in proportion to the force that invaded or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
them. Towards the cloſe of the campaign
in ſeventy ſix, theſe middle ſtates were called upon,
and did their duty nobly. They were witneſſes to
the almoſt expiring flame of human freedom. It
was the cloſe ſtruggle of life and death. The line
of inviſible diviſion, and on which, the unabated
fortitude of a Waſhington prevailed, and ſaved the
ſpark, that has ſince blazed in the north with unri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valled
luſtre.</p>
               <p>Let me aſk, ſir, what great exploits have you
performed? Through all the variety of changes
and opporunities which this war hath produced, I
know no one action of yours, that can be ſtiled maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1058401600:135"/>
You have moved in and out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> backward and
forward, round and round, as if valour conſiſted in
a military jig. The hiſtory and figure of your
movements would be truly ridiculous could they be
juſtly delineated. They reſemble the labours of
a puppy purſuing his tail, the end is ſtill at the
ſame diſtance, and all the turnings round muſt be
done over again.</p>
               <p>The firſt appearance of affairs at Ticonderoga
wore ſuch an unpromiſing aſpect, that it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
in July, to detach a part of the forces to the
ſupport of that quarter, which were otherwiſe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined
or intended to act againſt you, and this, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
has been the means of poſtponing your down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
to another campaign. The deſtruction of one
army at a time is work enough. We know, ſir,
what we are about, what we have to do, and how to
do it.</p>
               <p>Your progreſs from Cheſapeak, was marked by
no capital ſtroke of policy or heroiſm. Your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
aim was to get General Waſhington between
the Delaware and Schuylkill, and between Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia
and your army. In that ſituation, with a
river on each of his flanks, which united about five
miles below the city, and your army above him,
you could have intercepted his reinforcements and
ſupplies, cut off all his communication with the
country, and, if neceſſary, have diſpatched aſſiſtance
to open a paſſage for General Burgoyne. This
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1058401600:136"/>
ſcheme was too viſible to ſucceed, for had General
Waſhington ſuffered you to command the open
country above him, I think it a very reaſonable
conjecture that the conqueſt of Burgoyne would not
have taken place, becauſe you could, in that caſe,
have relieved him. It was therefore neceſſary,
while that important victory was in ſuſpence, to
trepan <hi>you</hi> into a ſituation, in which you could only
be on the defenſive, without the power of affording
him aſſiſtance. The manoeuvre had its effect,
and Burgoyne was conquered.</p>
               <p>There has been ſomething unmilitarily paſſive in
you from the time of your paſſing the Schuylkill, and
getting poſſeſſion of Philadelphia, to the cloſe of the
campaign, You miſtook a trap for a conqueſt, the
probability of which had been made known to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
and the edge of your triumph taken off by
our own information long before.</p>
               <p>Having got you into this ſituation, a ſcheme for a
general attack upon you at Germantown, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into execution on the fourth of October, and
though the ſucceſs was not equal to the excellence
of the plan, yet the attempting it, proved the genius
of America to be on the riſe, and her power ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to ſuperiority. The obſcurity of the
morning was your beſt friend, for a fog is always
favourable to an hunted enemy. Some weeks
after this, you, likewiſe, planned an attack on Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1058401600:137"/>
Waſhington while at Whitemarſh. Marched
out with infinite paracle, but on finding him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
to attack you the next morning, you pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
cut about, and retreated to Philadelphia,
with all the precipitation of a man conquered in
imagination.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the battle of German town, the
probability of Burgoyne's defeat gave a new policy
to affairs in Penſylvania, and it was judged moſt
conſiſtent with the general ſafety of America, to
wait the iſſue of the northern campaign. Slow and
ſure is ſound work. The news of that victory
arrived in our camp on the 18th of October, and
no ſooner did the ſhout of joy, and the report of
the thirteen cannon reach your ears, than you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
upon a retreat, and the next day, that is,
on the 19th, withdrew your drooping army into
Philadelphia. This movement was evidently dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by fear; and carried with it a poſitive confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that you dreaded a ſecond attack. It was
hiding yourſelf among women and children, and
ſleeping away the choiceſt part of a campaign
in expenſive inactivity. An army in a city can
never be a conquering army. The ſituation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
only of defence. It is a mere ſhelter; and
every military power in Europe will conclude you
to be eventually defeated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:1058401600:138"/>
The time when you made this retreat, was the
very time you ought to have fought a battle, in
order to put yourſelf in a condition of recovering
in Penſylvania, what you had loſt at Saratoga.
And the reaſon why you did not, muſt be either
prudence or cowardice; the former ſuppoſes your
inability, and the latter needs no explanation. I
draw no concluſions, ſir, but ſuch as are naturally
deduced from known and viſible facts, and ſuch as
will always have a being while the facts which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
them remain unaltered.</p>
               <p>After this retreat, a new difficulty aroſe, which
exhibited the power of Britain in a very contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
light, which was the attack and defence of Mud
Iſland. For ſeveral weeks did that little unfiniſhed
fortreſs ſtand out againſt all the attempts of Admiral
and General Howe. It was the fable of Bendar
realized on the Delaware. Scheme after ſcheme,
and force upon force were tried and defeated. The
garriſon, with ſcarce any thing to cover them but
their bravery, ſurvived in the midſt of mud, ſhot
and ſhells, and were at laſt obliged to give it up
more to the powers of time and gunpowder, than
to the military ſuperiority of the beſiegers.</p>
               <p>It is my ſincere opinion, that matters are in much
werſe condition with you, than what is generally
known. Your maſter's ſpeech at the opening of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
is like a ſoliloquy on ill luck. It ſhews him to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1058401600:139"/>
be coming a little to his reaſon, for ſenſe of pain is
the firſt ſymptom of recovery in profound ſtupefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
His condition is deplorable. He is obliged
to ſubmit to all the inſults of France and Spain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
daring to know or reſent them, and thankful for
the moſt trivial evaſions, to the moſt humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances.
The time <hi>was</hi> when he could not
<hi>deign</hi> an anſwer to a petition from America, and the
time now <hi>is</hi> when he dare not <hi>give</hi> an anſwer to
an affront from France. The capture of Burgoyne's
army will ſink his conſequence as much in Europe
as in America. In his ſpeech, he expreſſes his ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions
at the warlike preparations of France and
Spain, and he has only the one army which you
command to ſupport his character in the world
with; it remains very uncertain when, or in what
quarter it will be moſt wanted, or can be beſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed;
and this will partly account for the great
care you take to keep it from action and attacks,
for ſhould Burgoyne's fate be yours, which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
will, England may take her endleſs farewel,
not only of all America, but of all the Weſt Indies.</p>
               <p>Never did a nation invite deſtruction upon itſelf
with the eagerneſs and ignorance with which Britain
has done. Bent upon the ruin of a young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offending
country, ſhe hath drawn the ſword that
hath wounded herſelf to the heart, and in the agony
of her reſentment, hath applied a poiſon for a cure.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1058401600:140"/>
Her conduct towards America is a compound of
rage and lunacy; ſhe aims at the government of it,
yet preſerves neither dignity nor character in her
methods to obtain it. Were government a mere
manufacture, or article of commerce immaterial by
whom it ſhould be made or ſold, we might as well
employ her, as another, but when we conſider it as
the fountain from whence the general manners and
morality of a country take their riſe, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
entruſted with the execution thereof, are by
their ſerious example, and authority to ſupport
theſe principles, how abominably abſurd is the idea
of being hereafter governed by a ſet of men who
have been guilty of forgery, perjury, treachery,
theft, and every ſpecies of villainy, which the loweſt
wretches on earth could practiſe or invent. What
greater public curſe can befal any country, than to
be under ſuch authority, and what greater bleſſing,
than to be delivered therefrom. The ſoul of any
man of ſentiment, would riſe in brave rebellion
againſt them, and ſpurn them from the earth.</p>
               <p>The malignant and venomous tempered General
Vaughan has amuſed his ſavage fancy in burning
the whole town of Kingſton, in York government,
and the late governor of that ſtate, Mr. Tryon, in
his letter to General Parſons, has endeavoured to
juſtify it, and declared his with to juſtify it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his wiſh to burn the houſes of every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee-man
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1058401600:141"/>
in the country. Such a confeſſion from
one who was once entruſted with the powers of
civil government, is a reproach to the character.
But it is the wiſh and the declaration of a man
whom anguiſh and diſappointment have driven to
deſpair, and who is daily decaying into the grave
with conſtitutional rottenneſs.</p>
               <p>There is not in the compaſs of language a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of words to expreſs the baſeneſs of your king,
his miniſtry, and his army. They have refined
upon villainy till it wants a name. To the fiercer
vices of former ages, they have added the dregs and
ſcummings of the moſt finiſhed raſcallity, and are
ſo completely ſunk in ſerpentine deceit, that there
is not left among them <hi>one</hi> generous enemy.</p>
               <p>From ſuch men, and ſuch maſters, may the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
hand of Heaven, preſerve America! And
though her ſufferings are heavy and ſevere, they are
like ſtraws in the wind, compared to the weight of
evils ſhe would feel under the government of your
king, and his penſioned parliament.</p>
               <p>There is ſomething in meanneſs which excites a
ſpecies of reſentment that never ſubſides, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in cruelty which ſtirs up the heart to the
higheſt agony of human hatred. Britain hath filled
up both theſe characters till no addition can be
made, and hath not reputation left with us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
credit for the ſlighteſt promiſe. The will of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1058401600:142"/>
God hath parted us, and the deed is regiſtered for
eternity. When ſhe ſhall be a ſpot ſcarcely viſible
among the nations, America ſhall flouriſh, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
of Heaven, and the friend of mankind.</p>
               <p>For the domeſtic happineſs of Britain, and the
peace of the world, I wiſh ſhe had not a foot of
land but what is circumſcribed within her own
iſland. Extent of dominion hath been her ruin,
and inſtead of civilizing others, hath brutalized
herſelf. Her late reduction of India, under Clive
and his ſucceſſors, was not ſo properly a conqueſt,
as an extermination of mankind. She is the only
power who could practiſe the prodigal barbarity of
tying men to the mouths of loaded cannon and
blowing them away. It happens that General
Burgoyne, who made the report of that horrid
tranſaction in the Houſe of Commons, is now a
priſoner with us, and though an enemy, I can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to him for the truth of it, being confident
that he neither can nor will deny it. Yet Clive
received the approbation of the laſt parliament.</p>
               <p>When we take a ſurvey of mankind, we cannot
help curſing the wretch, who, to the unavoidable
misfortunes of nature, ſhall wilfully add the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of war. One would think there were evils
enough in the world without ſtudying to increaſe
them, and that life is ſufficiently ſhort, without
thanking the ſand that meaſures it. The hiſtories of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1058401600:143"/>
Alexander, and Charles of Sweden, are the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of human devils; a good man cannot think of
their actions without abhorrence, nor of their deaths
without rejoicings. To ſee the bounties of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
deſtroyed, the beautiful face of nature laid
waſte, and the choiceſt works of creation and art
tumbled into ruin, would fetch a curſe from the
ſoul of piety itſelf. But in this country the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is heightened by a new combination of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
circumſtances. America was young, and,
compared with other countries, was virtuous. None,
but a Herod of uncommon malice would have
made war upon infancy and innocence; and none
but a people of the moſt finiſhed fortitude dared,
under thoſe circumſtances, have reſiſted tyranny.
The natives, or their anceſtors had fled from the
former oppreſſions of England, and, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
of bees, had changed a wilderneſs into a
habitable world. To Britain, they were indebted
for nothing. The country was the gift of Heaven,
and God alone is their Lord and ſovereign.</p>
               <p>The time, ſir, will come, when you, in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
hour, ſhall reckon up your miſeries by your
murders in America. Life, with you, begins to
wear a clouded aſpect. The viſion of pleaſurable
deluſion is wearing away, and changing to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
wild of age and ſorrow. The poor reflection
of having ſerved your king, will yield you no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1058401600:144"/>
in your parting moments. He will crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the ſame undiſtinguiſhed aſhes with yourſelf,
and have ſins enough of his own to anſwer for. It
is not the farcical benedictions of a biſhop, nor the
cringing hypocriſy of a court of chaplains, nor the
formality of an act of parliament, that can change
guilt into innocence, or make the puniſhment of
<hi>one</hi> pang the leſs. You may, perhaps, be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be ſerious, but this deſtruction of the goods
of Providence, this havock of the human race, and
this ſowing the world with miſchief, muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for to him who made and governs it. To
us they are only preſent ſufferings, but to him they
are deep rebellions.</p>
               <p>If there is a ſin ſuperior to every other, it is that
of wilful and offenſive war. Moſt other ſins are
circumſcribed within narrow limits, that is, the
power of <hi>one</hi> man cannot give them a very general
tenſion, and many kind of ſins have only a mental
exiſtence, from which no infection ariſes; but he
who is the author of a war, lets looſe the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion
of hell, and opens a vein that bleeds a nation
to death. We leave it to England and Indians to
boaſt of theſe honours; we feel no thirſt for ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
glory; a nobler flame, a purer ſpirit animates
America. She hath taken up the ſword of virtuous
defence; ſhe hath bravely put herſelf between ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and freedom, between a curſe and a bleſſing,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1058401600:145"/>
determined to expel the one, and protect the other.</p>
               <p>It is the object only of war that makes it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.
And if ever there were <hi>a juſt</hi> war ſince
the world began, it is this which America is now
engaged in. She invaded no land of yours. She
hired no mercenaries to burn your towns, nor
Indians to maſſacre their inhabitants. She wanted
nothing from you, and was indebted nothing to
you; and thus circumſtanced, her defence is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
and her proſperity certain.</p>
               <p>Yet it is not on the <hi>juſtice</hi> only, but likewiſe on
the <hi>importance</hi> of this cauſe, that I ground my ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enthuſiaſtical confidence of our ſucceſs. The
vaſt extenſion of America, makes her of too much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
in the ſcale of Providence, to be caſt like a
pearl before ſwine, at the feet of an European iſland;
and of much leſs conſequence would it be that
Britain were ſunk in the ſea, than that America
ſhould miſcarry. There has been ſuch a chain of
extraordinary events in the diſcovery of this
country at firſt, in the peopling and planting it, and
afterwards, in the rearing and nurſing it to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtate, and in the protection of it through the
preſent war, that no man can doubt, but Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
hath ſome nobler end to accompliſh than the
gratification of the petty Elector of Hanover, or
the ignorant and inſignificant King of Britain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:1058401600:146"/>
As the blood of the martyrs hath been the ſeed
of the chriſtian church, ſo the political perſecutions
of England, will, and hath already enriched America
with induſtry, experience, union and importance.
Before the preſent aera ſhe was a mere chaos of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemented
colonies, individually expoſed to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages
of the Indians, and the invaſion of any power
that Britain ſhould be at war with. She had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhe could call her own. Her felicity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon accident. The convulſions of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
might have thrown her from one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
to another, till ſhe had been the ſlave of
all, and ruined by every one; for until ſhe had
ſpirit enough to become her own maſter, there was
no knowing to which maſter ſhe ſhould belong.
<hi>That</hi> period, thank God, is paſt, and ſhe is no
longer the dependant, diſunited colonies of Britain,
but the Independent and United States of America,
knowing no maſter but Heaven and herſelf. You
or your king, may call this "Deluſion," "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,"
or what name you pleaſe. To us it is
perfectly indifferent. The iſſue will determine
the character, and time will give it a name as laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as his own.</p>
               <p>You have now, ſir, tried the fate of three cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns,
and can fully declare to England, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is to be got on your part, but blows and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
bones; and nothing on hers, but waſte of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1058401600:147"/>
trade and credit, and an encreaſe of poverty and tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
You are now only where you might have been
two years ago without the loſs of a ſingle ſhip, and
yet not a ſtep the forwarder towards the conqueſt
of the continent; becauſe, as I have already hinted,
"An army in a city can never be a conquering ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my."
The full amount of your loſſes ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the war, exceeds twenty thouſand men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
millions of treaſure, for which you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in exchange. Our expences, though great,
are circulated within ourſelves. Yours is a direct
ſinking of money, and that from both ends at once,
firſt, in hiring troops out of the nation, and in
paying them afterwards, becauſe the money in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caſe can return again to Britain. We are
already in poſſeſſion of the prize, you only in ſuit
for it. To us it is a real treaſure, to you it would be
only an empty triumph. Our expences will repay
themſelves with tenfold intereſt, while yours en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
upon you everlaſting poverty.</p>
               <p>Take a review, ſir, of the ground you have gone
over, and let it teach you policy, if it cannot ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.
You ſtand upon a very tottering foundation.
A change of the miniſtry in England, may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
bring your meaſures into queſtion, and your
head to the block. Clive, with all his ſucceſſes,
had ſome difficulty in eſcaping, and yours, being all
a war of loſſes, will afford you leſs pretenſions,
and your enemies more ground for impeachment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1058401600:148"/>
Go home, ſir, and endeavour to ſave the remains
of your ruined country by a juſt repreſentation of
the madneſs of her meaſures. A few moments
well applied, may yet preſerve her from political de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
I am not one of thoſe who wiſh to ſee
Europe in a flame, becauſe I am perſuaded ſuch an
event will not ſhorten the war. The rupture, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
is confined between the two powers of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica
and England. England finds ſhe cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
America, and America has no wiſh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
England. You are fighting for what you can
never obtain, and we defending what we mean
never to part with. A few words, therefore,
ſettle the bargain. Let England, mind her
own buſineſs, and we will mind ours. Govern
yourſelves and we will govern ourſelves. You may
then trade where you pleaſe unmoleſted by us, and
we will trade where we pleaſe unmoleſted by you;
and ſuch articles as we can purchaſe of each other
better than elſewhere, may be mutually done. If
it were poſſible that you could carry on the war for
twenty years, you muſt ſtill come to this point at
laſt, or worſe, and the ſooner you think of it the
better it will be for you.</p>
               <p>My official ſituation enables me to know the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
inſults which Britain is obliged to put up
with from foreign powers, and the wretched ſhifts
ſhe is driven to, to gloſs them over. Her reduced
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1058401600:149"/>
ſtrength, and exhauſted coffers in a three years war
with America, have given a powerful ſuperiority
to France and Spain. She is now a match for them.
—But, if neither counſels can prevail on her to
think, nor ſufferings awaken her to reaſon, ſhe muſt
e'en go on, till the honour of England becomes a
proverb of contempt, and Europe dub her the land
of fools.</p>

               <p>WITH all the pleaſure with which a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes
bad company for good, I take my leave of
Sir William and return to you. It is now nearly
three years ſince the tyranny of Britain received its
firſt repulſe by the arms of America. A period,
which has given birth to the New World, and
erected a monument of folly to the old.</p>
               <p>I cannot help being ſometimes ſurpriſed at the
complimentary references, which I have ſeen and
heard made to ancient hiſtories and tranſactions.
The wiſdom of civil governments, and ſenſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the States of Greece and Rome, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
held up as objects of excellence and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Mankind have lived for very little purpoſe,
if, at this period of the world, they muſt go two or
three thouſand years back for leſſons and examples.
We do diſhonourary injuſtice to ourſelves by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them in ſuch a ſuperior line. We have no juſt
authority for it, neither can we tell why it is that
we ſhould ſuppoſe ourſelves inferior.</p>
               <p>Could the miſt of antiquity be taken away, and
men and things viewed as they then really were,
it is more than probable that they would admire us,
rather than we them. America has ſurmounted a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1058401600:151"/>
greater variety and combination of difficulties, than,
I believe, ever fell to the ſhare of any one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the ſame ſpace of time, and has repleniſhed
the world with more uſeful knowledge, and ſounder
maxims of civil government than were ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in any age before. Had it not been for
America, there had been no ſuch thing as freedom
left throughout the whole univerſe. England hath
loſt hers, in a long chain of right reaſoning from
wrong principles, and it is from this now ſhe muſt
learn the reſolution to redreſs herſelf, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
how.</p>
               <p>The Grecians and Romans were ſtrongly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of liberty, but <hi>not</hi> the <hi>principle,</hi>
for at the time they were determined not to be
ſlaves themſelves, they employed their power to
enſlave the reſt of mankind. But this diſtinguiſhed
aera is blotted by no one miſanthropical vice. In
ſhort, if the principle on which the cauſe is founded,
the univerſal bleſſings that are to ariſe from
it, the difficulties that accompanied it; the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
with which it has been debated, the
ſortitude by which it has been ſupported, the
ſtrength of the power we had to oppoſe, and the
condition in which we undertook it, be all taken
in one view, we may juſtly ſtile it, the moſt virtuous
and illuſtrious revolution that ever graced the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of mankind.</p>
               <p>A good opinion of ourſelves is exceedingly
neceſſary in private life, but abſolutely neceſſary in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1058401600:152"/>
public life; and of the utmoſt importance in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
national character. I have no notion of
yielding the palm of the United States to any Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
or Romans that were ever born. We have
equalled the braveſt in times of danger, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
the wiſeſt in the conſtruction of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
<hi>no one in America excepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this agreeable eminence, let us take a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of preſent affairs. The ſpirit of corruption
is ſo inſeparably interwoven with Britiſh politics,
that their miniſtry ſuppoſe all mankind are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by the ſame motive. They have no idea of
people ſubmitting even to a temporary inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
from an attachment to rights and privileges.
Their plans of buſineſs are calculated <hi>by</hi> the hour,
and <hi>for</hi> the hour, and are uniform in nothing but
in the corruption which give them birth. They
never had, neither have they at this time, any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
plan for the conqueſt of America by arms.
They know not how to go about it, neither have
they the power to effect it, if they could know. The
thing is not within the compaſs of human practicabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
for America is too extenſive either to be fully
conquered, or <hi>paſſively</hi> defended. But ſhe may be
<hi>actively</hi> defended, by defeating or making priſoners
of the army that invades her. And this is the
only ſyſtem of defence that can be effectual in a
large country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:1058401600:153"/>
There is ſomething in a war carried on by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion,
which makes it differ in circumſtances
from any other mode of war, becauſe, he who
conducts it cannot tell whether the ground he gains,
be for him, or againſt him, when he firſt makes
it. In the winter of ſeventy ſix, General Howe,
marched with an air of victory through the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys,
the conſequence of which, was his defeat,
and General Burgoyne, at Saratoga experienced
the ſame fate from the ſame cauſe. The Spaniards,
about two years ago, were defeated by the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines
in the ſame manner, that is, their firſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
became a trap, in which they were totally
routed. And, whoever will attend to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and events of a war carried on by invaſion,
will find, that any invader, in order to be finally
conquered, muſt begin firſt to conquer.</p>
               <p>I confefs myſelf one of thoſe who believe the
loſs of Philadelphia to be attended with more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
than injuries. The caſe ſtood thus. The
enemy imagined Philadelphia to be of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to us, than it really was; for we all know
that it had long ceaſed to be a port, not a cargo
of goods had been brought into it for near a
twelvemonth, nor any fixed manufactories, nor
even ſhip-building carried on in it; yet, as the
enemy believed the conqueſt of it to be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable,
and, to that belief, added the abſurd idea,
that the ſoul of all America was centered there,
and would be conquered there, it naturally follows,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1058401600:154"/>
that their poſſeſſion of it, by not anſwering the end
propoſed, muſt break up the plans they had fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly
gone upon, and either oblige them to form a
new one, for which their preſent ſtrength is not
ſufficient, or to give over the attempt.</p>
               <p>We never had ſo ſmall an army to fight againſt,
nor ſo fair an opportunity of final ſucceſs as <hi>now.</hi>
The death wound is already given. The day is
our own, if we follow it up. The enemy by his
ſituation is within our reach, and by his reduced
ſtrength is within our power. The miniſters of
Britain may rage as they pleaſe, but our part is to
conquer their armies. Let them wrangle and
welcome, but let it not draw our attention from
the <hi>one</hi> thing needful. <hi>Here, in this</hi> ſpot is our
buſineſs to be accompliſhed; our felicity ſecured.
What we have now to do, is as clear as light, and
the way to do it is as ſtrait as a line. It needs
not to be commented upon, yet, in order to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
underſtood, I will put a caſe that cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of a miſtake.</p>
               <p>Had the armies under Generals Howe and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne
been united and taken poſt at Germantown,
and had the northern army, under General Gates,
been joined to that under General Waſhington, at
Whitemarſh, the conſequence would have been a
general action; and, if in that action, we had killed
and taken the ſame number of officers and men,
that is, between nine and ten thouſand, with the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1058401600:155"/>
ſame quantity of artillery, arms, ſtores, &amp;c. as have
been taken at the northward, and obliged General
Howe with the remains of his army, that is, with
the ſame number he now commands, to take ſhelter
in Philadelphia, we ſhould certainly have thought
ourſelves the greateſt heroes in the world; and
ſhould as ſoon as the ſeaſon permitted, have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
together all the force of the continent, and
laid ſiege to the city, for it requires a much greater
force to beſiege an enemy in a town, than to defeat
them in the field. The caſe <hi>now</hi> is juſt the ſame,
as if it had been produced by the means I have
here ſuppoſed. Between nine and ten thouſand
have been killed and taken, all their ſtores are in
our poſſeſſion, and General Howe in conſequence
of that victory, has thrown himſelf for ſhelter into
Philadelphia. He, or his trifling friend Galloway,
may form what pretences they pleaſe, yet no juſt
reaſon can be given for their going into winter
quarters ſo early as the 19th of October, but their
apprehenſion of a defeat if they continued out, or
their conſcious inability to keep the field with
ſafety. I ſee no advantage which can ariſe to
America, by hunting the enemy from State to
State. It is a triumph without a prize, and wholly
unworthy the attention of a people determined to
conquer. Neither can any State promiſe to itſelf
ſecurity, while the enemy remains in a condition to
tranſport themſelves from one part of the continent
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1058401600:156"/>
to another. Howe, likewiſe, cannot conquer where
we have no army to oppoſe, therefore any ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movals
in him are mean and cowardly, and reduces
Britain to a common pilferer. If he retreats from
Philadelphia, he will be deſpiſed; if he ſtays, he
may be ſhut up and ſtarved out, and the country,
if he advances into, may become his Saratoga. He
has his choice of evils, and we of opportunities. If
he moves early, it is not only a ſign, but a proof
that he expects no reinforcement, and his delays
will prove that he either waits for the arrival of a
plan to go upon, or force to execute it, or both:
in <hi>which</hi> caſe, our ſtrength will encreaſe more than
his, therefore, in <hi>any</hi> caſe, we cannot be wrong, if
we do but proceed.</p>
               <p>The particular condition of Penſylvania, deſerves
the attention of all the other States. Her military
ſtrength muſt not be eſtimated by the number of
inhabitants. Here are men of all nations, charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
profeſſions, and intereſts. Here are the firmeſt
whigs, ſurviving, like ſparks in the ocean, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenched
and uncooled, in the midſt of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and diſaffection. Here are men loſing their
all with cheerfulneſs, and collecting fire and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
from the flames of their own eſtates. Here
are others ſkulking in ſecret; many making a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
of the times; and numbers, who are changing
whig and tory with the circumſtances of every
day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:1058401600:157"/>
It is by mere dint of fortitude and perſeverance,
that the whigs of this ſtate, have been able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſo good a countenance, and do even what they
have done. We want help, and the ſooner it can
arrive, the more effectual it will be. The invaded
ſtate, be it which it may, will always feel an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
burthen upon its back, and be hard
ſet to ſupport its civil power with ſufficient
authority: and this difficulty will always riſe or
fall in proportion as the other ſtates throw in their
aſſiſtance to the common cauſe.</p>
               <p>The enemy will moſt probably make many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuvres
at the opening of this campaign, to amuſe
and draw off the attention of the ſeveral ſtates from
the <hi>one thing needful.</hi> We may expect to hear of
alarms, and pretended expeditions to <hi>this</hi> place,
and <hi>that</hi> place; to the ſouthward, the eaſtward, and
the northward, all intended to prevent our forming
into one formidable body. The leſs the enemy's
ſtrength is, the more ſubtleties of this kind will
they make uſe of. Their exiſtence depends upon
it, becauſe the force of America, when collected, is
ſufficient to ſwallow their preſent army up. It is
therefore our buſineſs to make ſhort work of it, by
bending our whole attention to <hi>this one principal
point,</hi> for the inſtant that the main body, under Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Howe is defeated, all the inferior alarms
throughout the continent, like ſo many ſhadows,
will follow his downfal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:1058401600:158"/>
The only way to finiſh a war with the leaſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
bloodſhed, or perhaps without any, is to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
an army, againſt the power of which, the enemy
ſhall have no chance. By not doing this, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the war, and double both the calamities and
the expences of it. What a rich and happy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
would America be, were ſhe, by a vigourous
exertion, to reduce Howe, as ſhe hath reduced
Burgoyne. Her currency would riſe to millions
beyond its preſent value. Every man would be
rich, and every man would have it in his power to
be happy. And why not do theſe things? What
is there to hinder? America is her own miſtreſs, and
can do what ſhe pleaſes.</p>
               <p>If we had not at this time a man in the field, we
could, nevertheleſs, raiſe an army in a few weeks,
ſufficient to overwhelm all the force which General
Howe at preſent commands. Vigour and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
will do any thing and every thing. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the war with this kind of ſpirit, why not end
it with the ſame? Here, gentlemen, is the enemy.
Here is the army. The intereſt, the happineſs of all
America is centered in this half ruined ſpot. Come
on and help us. Here are laurels, come and ſhare
them. Here are tories, come and help us to expel
them. Here are whigs that will make you wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and enemies that dread your coming,</p>
               <p>The worſt of all policy, is that of doing things by
halves. Penny wiſe and pound fooliſh, has been
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1058401600:159"/>
the ruin of thouſands. The preſent ſpring, if
rightly improved, will free us from all our troubles,
and ſave us the expence of millions. We have
now only one army to cope with. No opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
can be fairer; no proſpect more promiſing.
I ſhall conclude this paper, with a few outlines of a
plan, either for filling up the battalions with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
or for raiſing an additional force, for any
limited time, on any ſudden emergency.</p>
               <p>That in which every man is intereſted, is every
man's duty to ſupport. And any burthen which
falls equally on all men, and, from which every
man is to receive an equal benefit, is conſiſtent
with the moſt perfect ideas of liberty. I would
wiſh to revive ſomething of that virtuous ambition
which firſt called America into the field. Then
every man was eager to do his part, and perhaps
the principal reaſon why we have in any degree
fallen therefrom, is, becauſe we did not ſet a ſufficient
value by it at firſt, but left it to blaze out by itſelf,
inſtead of regulating and preſerving it by juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of reſt and ſervice.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe any ſtate, whoſe number of effective
inhabitants was 80,000, ſhould be required to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
3,200 men towards the defence of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
on any ſudden emergency.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let the whole number of effective inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
be divided into hundreds; then if each of thoſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1058401600:160"/>
hundreds turn out four men, the whole number of
3,200 will be had.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let the names of each hundred men be
entered in a book, and let four dollars be collected
from each man, with as much more as any of the
gentlemen whoſe abilities can afford it, ſhall pleaſe
to throw in, which gifts ſhall likewiſe be entered
againſt the donors names.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let the ſums ſo collected be offered as a
preſent, over and above the bounty of twenty
dollars, to any four who may be inclined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
themſelves as volunteers; if more than four
offer, the majority of the ſubſcribers preſent ſhall
determine which; if none offer, then four out of
the hundred ſhall be taken by lot, who ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
to the ſaid ſums, and ſhall either go, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
others that will, in the ſpace of ſix days.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As it will always happen, that in the
ſpace of ground on which an hundred men ſhall
live, there will be always a number of perſons, who,
by age and infirmity, are incapable of doing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
ſervice, and as ſuch perſons are generally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of the greateſt part of the property in any
county, their portion of ſervice, therefore, will be
to furniſh each man with a blanket, which will
make a regimental coat, jacket and breeches, or
cloaths in lieu thereof, and another for a watch cloak,
and two pair of ſhoes—for however choice people
may be of theſe things, matters not in caſes of this
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1058401600:161"/>
kind—Thoſe who live always in houſes, can find
many ways to keep themſelves warm, but it is a
ſhame and a ſin to ſuffer a ſoldier in the field to
want a blanket while there is one in the country.</p>
               <p>Should the cloathing not be wanted, the ſuperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
or infirm perſons poſſeſſing property, may,
in lieu thereof, throw in their money ſubſcriptions,
towards encreaſing the bounty; for though age will
naturally exempt a perſonal ſervice, it cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
him from his ſhare of the charge, becauſe the
men are raiſed for the defence of property and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
jointly.</p>
               <p>There never was a ſcheme againſt which objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
might not be raiſed. But this alone is not a
ſufficient reaſon for rejection. The only line to
judge truly upon, is, to draw out and admit all
the objections which can fairly be made, and
place againſt them all the contrary qualities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
and advantages, then by ſtriking a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
you come at the true character of any ſcheme,
principle or poſition.</p>
               <p>The moſt material advantages of the plan here
propoſed, are eaſe, expedition, and cheapneſs; yet
the men ſo raiſed, get a much larger bounty, than
is, any where, at preſent given; becauſe all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
extravagance, and conſequent idleneſs of
recruiting are ſaved or prevented. The country
incurs no new debt, nor intereſt thereon; the whole
matter being all ſettled at once, and entirely done
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1058401600:162"/>
with. It is a ſubſcription anſwering all the purpoſes
of a tax, without either the charge or trouble of
collecting. The men are ready for the field
with the greateſt poſſible expedition, becauſe, it
becomes the duty of the inhabitants themſelves, in
every part of the country, to find up their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, inſtead of leaving it to a recruiting
ſerjeant, who, be he ever ſo induſtrious, cannot
know always where to apply.</p>
               <p>I do not propoſe this as a regular digeſted plan,
neither will the limits of this paper admit any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remarks upon it. I believe it to be a hint ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of much improvement, and as ſuch ſubmit it
to the public.</p>

            <p>THERE is a dignity in the warm paſſions of a
whig, which is never to be found in the cold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of a tory. In the one, nature is only heated
—in the other ſhe is poiſoned. The inſtant the

the latter knows no relief but revenge. This ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
diſtinction, will, I believe, apply in all caſes,
and ſuit as well the meridian of England as
America.</p>
            <p>As I preſume your laſt proclamation will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the ſtrictures of other pens, I ſhall confine
my remarks to only a few parts thereof. All that
you have ſaid, might have been compriſed in half
the compaſs. It is tedious and unmeaning, and
only a repetition of your former follies, with here
and there an offenſive aggravation. Your cargo
of pardons will have no market—It is unfaſhionable
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1058401600:164"/>
to look at them Even ſpeculation is at an end.
They are become a perfect drug, and no way cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
for the climate.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of your proclamation, you ſay,
"The policy, as well as the BENEVOLENCE
OF GREAT BRITAIN, have thus far checked
the extremes of war, when they tended to diſtreſs a
people, ſtill conſidered as their fellow ſubjects, and
to deſolate a country ſhortly to become again a
ſource of mutual advantage." What you mean
by "the BENEVOLENCE of Great Britain,"
is to me, inconceivable. To put a plain queſtion:
Do you conſider yourſelves men or devils? For
until this point is ſettled, no determinate ſenſe can
be put upon the expreſſion. You have already
equalled, and in many places excelled the ſavages
of either Indies; and if you have yet a cruelty in
ſtore, you muſt have imported it unmixed with
every human material from the original warehouſe
of hell.</p>
            <p>To the interpoſition of Providence, and her
bleſſings on our endeavours, and not to BRITISH
BENEVOLENCE, are we indebted for the ſhort
chain that limits your ravages. Remember, you
do not at this time, command a foot of land on the
continent of America. Staten Iſland, York Iſland,
a ſmall part of Long Iſland and Rhode Iſland,
circumſcribe your power; and even thoſe you hold
at the expence of the Weſt Indies. To avoid a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1058401600:165"/>
defeat, and prevent a deſertion of your troops, you
have taken up your quarters in holes and corners
of inacceſſible ſecurity; and in order to conceal
what every one can conceive, you now endeavour
to impoſe your weakneſs upon us for an act of
mercy. If you think to ſucceed by ſuch ſhadowy
devices, you are but infants in the political world;
you have the A, B, C, of ſtratagem yet to learn,
and are wholly ignorant of the people you have to
contend with. Like men in a ſtate of intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you forget that the reſt of the world have eyes,
and that the ſame ſtupidity which conceals you
from yourſelves, expoſes you to their ſatire and
contempt.</p>
            <p>The paragraph I have quoted, ſtands as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
to the following: "But when that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
(America) profeſſes the unnatural deſign, not
only of eſtranging herſelf from us, but of mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
herſelf and her reſources to our enemies, the
whole conteſt is changed; and the queſtion is,
how far Great Britain may, by every means in her
power, deſtroy or render uſeleſs, a connection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
for her ruin, and the aggrandizement of
France. Under ſuch circumſtances, the laws of
ſelf-preſervation muſt direct the conduct of Britain,
and if the Britiſh Colonies are to become an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
to France, will direct her, to render that
acceſſion of as little avail as poſſible to her enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:1058401600:166"/>
I conſider you, in this declaration, like madmen
biting in the hour of death. It contains, likewiſe,
a fraudulent meanneſs; for, in order to juſtify a
barbarous concluſion, you have advanced a falſe
poſition. The treaty we have formed with France
is open, noble and generous. It is the true policy,
founded on ſound philoſophy, and neither a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or mortgage, as you would ſcandalouſly inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate.
I have ſeen every article, and ſpeak from
poſitive knowledge. In France, we have found an
affectionate friend, a faithful ally; from Britain
nothing but tyranny, cruelty, and infidelity.</p>
            <p>But the happineſs is, that the miſchief you
threaten, is not in your power to execute; and if it
were, the puniſhment would return upon you, in a
tenfold degree. The humanity of America, hath
hitherto, reſtrained her from acts of retaliation, and
the affection ſhe retains for many individuals in
England, who have fed, clothed, and comforted her
priſoners, has, to the preſent day, warded off her
reſentment, and operated as a ſcreen to the whole.
But even theſe conſiderations muſt ceaſe, when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
objects interfere and oppoſe them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
aggravations will provoke a retort, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
juſtify the meaſure. We mean now to take you
ſeriouſly up upon your own ground and principles,
and as you do, ſo ſhall you be done by.</p>
            <p>You ought to know, gentlemen, that England
and Scotland, are far more expoſed to incendiary
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1058401600:167"/>
deſolation than America in her preſent ſtate, can
poſſibly be. We occupy a country, with but few
towns, and whoſe riches conſiſt in land and annual
produce. The two laſt can ſuſſer but little, and
that only within a very limited compaſs. In Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
it is otherwiſe. Her wealth lies chiefly in
cities and large towns, the repoſitories of manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and fleets of merchantmen.—There is not a
nobleman's country ſeat but may be laid in aſhes
by a ſingle perſon. Your own, may probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the proof: In ſhort, there is no evil
which cannot be returned, when you come to incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary
miſchief.—The ſhips in the Thames, may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be eaſily ſet on fire, as the temporary
bridge was a few years ago; yet of that affair, no
diſcovery was ever made; and the loſs you would
ſuſtain by ſuch an event, executed at a proper ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
is infinitely greater than any you can inflict.
The Eaſt India houſe, and the bank, neither,
are, nor can be ſecure from this ſort of deſtruction,
and, as Dr. Price juſtly obſerves, a fire at the latter
would bankrupt the nation. It has never been
the cuſtom of France and England, when at war,
to make thoſe havocs on each other, becauſe the
eaſe with which they could retaliate, rendered it as
impolitic, as if each had deſtroyed his own.</p>
            <p>But think not, gentlemen, that our diſtance ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
you, or our invention fails us. We can much
eaſier accompliſh ſuch a point than any nation in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1058401600:168"/>
We talk the ſame language, dreſs in the
ſame habit, and appear with the ſame manners as
yourſelves. We can paſs from one part of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
to another unſuſpected; many of us are
as well acquainted with the country as you are, and
ſhould you impoliticly provoke our will, you will
moſt aſſuredly lament the effects of it. Miſchiefs
of this kind, requires no army to execute them.
The means are obvious, and the opportunities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guardable.
I hold up a warning piece to your
ſenſes, if you have any left, and "to the unhappy
people likewiſe, whoſe affairs are committed to
you<note n="*" place="bottom">General Clinton's letter to Congreſs.</note>." I call not with the rancour of an enemy,
but with the earneſtneſs of a friend, on the deluded
people of England, leſt, between your blunders and
theirs, they ſink beneath the evils contrived for us.</p>
            <p>"He who lives in a glaſs-houſe, ſays the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
proverb, ſhould never begin throwing ſtones."
This, gentlemen, is exactly your caſe, and you
muſt be the moſt ignorant of mankind, or ſuppoſe
us ſo, not to ſee on which ſide the balance of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
will fall. There are many other modes of
retaliation, which for ſeveral reaſons, I chooſe not
to mention. But, be aſſured of this, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
you put a threat in execution, a counter blow
will follow it. If you openly profeſs yourſelves
ſavages, it is high time we ſhould treat you as ſuch,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1058401600:169"/>
and if nothing but diſtreſs can recover you to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to puniſh, will become an office of charity.</p>
            <p>While your fleet lay laſt winter in the Delaware, I
offered my ſervice to the Penſylvanian navy-board,
then at Trenton, as one who would make a party with
them, or any four or five gentlemen, on an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
down the river, to ſet fire to it, and though it
was not then accepted, nor the thing perſonally
attempted, it is more than probable, that your own
folly will provoke a much more vulnerable part.
Say not, when the miſchief is done, that you had
warning, and remember that we did not begin it,
but mean to repay it. Thus much for your ſavage
and impolitic threat.</p>
            <p>In another part of your proclamation you ſay,
"But if the honours of a military life, are become
the object of the Americans, let them ſeek thoſe
honours, under the banners of their rightful ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
and in fighting the battles of the united Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
empire, againſt our late mutual and natural
enemies." Surely! The union of abſurdity with
madneſs, was never marked with more diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
lines than theſe. Your rightful ſovereign as
you call him, may do well enough for you, who
dare not enquire into the humble capacities of the
man; but we, who eſtimate perſons and things by
their real worth, cannot ſuffer our judgments to be
ſo impoſed upon; and, unleſs it is your wiſh to
ſee him expoſed, it ought to be your endeavour to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1058401600:170"/>
keep him out of ſight. The leſs you have to ſay
about him the better. We have done with him,
and that ought to be anſwer enough. You have
often been told ſo. Strange! that the anſwer muſt
be ſo often repeated. You go a begging with your
king as with a brat, or with ſome unſaleable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
you were tired of; and though every body
tells, no, no, ſtill you keep hawking him about.
But there is one who will have him in a little time,
and as we have no inclination to diſappoint you of a
cuſtomer, we bid you nothing for him.</p>
            <p>The impertinent folly of the paragraph I have
juſt quoted, deſerve no other notice than to be
laughed at, and thrown by, but the principle on
which it is founded, is deteſtable. We are invited
to ſubmit to a man who has attempted by every
cruelty to deſtroy us, and to join him in making
war againſt France, who is already at war againſt
him for our ſupport.</p>
            <p>Can Bedlam, in concert with Lucifer, form a
more mad and deviliſh requeſt; Were it poſſible a
people could ſink into ſuch apoſtacy, they would
deſerve to be ſwept from the earth, like the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Sodom and Gomorrah. The propoſition
is an univerſal affront to the rank which man holds
in the creation, and an indignity to him who
placed him there. It ſuppoſes him made up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſpark of honour, and under no obligation to
God or man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:1058401600:171"/>
What ſort of men or Chriſtians muſt you ſuppoſe
the Americans to be, who, after ſeeing their moſt
humble petitions inſultingly rejected, the moſt griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
laws paſſed to diſtreſs them in every quarter,
an undeclared war let looſe upon them, and Indians
and negroes invited to the ſlaughter; who after
ſeeing their kindred murdered, their fellow citizens
ſtarved to death in priſons, and their houſes and
property deſtroyed and buried; who after the moſt
ſerious appeals to heaven, the moſt ſolemn abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by oath of all government connected with you,
and the moſt heart-felt pledges and proteſtations
of faith to each other; and who, after ſoliciting
the friendſhip, and entering into alliances with other
nations, ſhould at laſt break through all theſe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
civil and divine, by complying with your
horrid and infernal propoſal. Ought we ever after
to be conſidered as a part of the human race? Or,
ought we not rather to be blotted from the ſociety
of mankind, and become a ſpectacle of miſery to
the world? But there is ſomething in corruption,
which, like a jaundiced eye, transfers the colour of
of itſelf to the object it looks upon, and ſees every
thing ſtained and impure; for unleſs you were
capable of ſuch conduct yourſelves, you could never
have ſuppoſed ſuch a character in us. The offer
fixes your infamy. It exhibits you as a nation
without faith, with whom oaths and treaties are
conſidered as trifles, and the breaking them, as the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1058401600:172"/>
breaking of a bubble. Regard to decency or to
rank, might have taught you better, or pride in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
you, though virtue could not. There is not
left a ſtep in the degradation of character to which
you can now deſcend; you have put your foot on
the ground floor, and the key of the dungeon is
turned upon you.</p>
            <p>That the invitation may want nothing of being a
complete monſter, you have thought proper to finiſh
it with an aſſertion which has no foundation, either
in fact or philoſophy; and as Mr. Ferguſon, your
ſecretary, is a man of letters, and has made
civil ſociety his ſtudy, and publiſhed a treatiſe on
that ſubject, I addreſs this part to him.</p>
            <p>In the cloſe of the paragraph which I laſt quoted,
France is ſtiled the "natural enemy" of England,
and by way of lugging us into ſome ſtrange idea, ſhe
is ſtiled the "late mutual and natural enemy" of
both countries. I deny that ſhe ever was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
enemy of either, and that there does not exiſt
in nature ſuch a principle. The expreſſion is an
unmeaning barbariſm, and wholly unphiloſophical,
when applied to beings of the ſame ſpecies, let their
ſtation in the creation be what it may. We have
a perfect idea of a natural enemy when we think of
the devil, becauſe the enmity is perpetual, unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and unabateable. It admits neither of peace,
truce, or treaty; conſequently the warfare is eternal,
and therefore it is natural. But man with man
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1058401600:173"/>
cannot arrange in the ſame oppoſition. Their
quarrels are accidental and equivocally created.
They become friends or enemies at the change of
temper, as the caſt of intereſt inclines them. The
Creator of man did not conſtitute them the natural
enemy of each other. He has not made any one
order of beings ſo. Even wolves may quarrel, ſtill
they herd together. If any two nations are ſo, then
muſt all nations be ſo, otherwiſe it is not nature,
but cuſtom, and the offence frequently originates
with the accuſer. England is as truly the natural
enemy of France, as France is of England, and,
perhaps, more ſo. Separated from the reſt of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
ſhe has contracted an unſocial habit of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and imagines in others the jealouſy ſhe creates
in herſelf. Never long ſatisfied with peace, ſhe
ſuppoſes the diſcontent univerſal, and buoyed up
with her own importance, conceives herſelf the
only object pointed at. The expreſſion has been
often uſed, and always with a fraudulent deſign;
for when the idea of a natural enemy is conceived,
it prevents all other enquiries, and the real cauſe of
the quarrel is hidden in the univerſality of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.
Men ſtart at the notion of a natural enemy,
and aſk no other queſtion. The cry obtains credi
like the alarm of a mad dog, and is one of thoſe
kind of tricks, which, by operating on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
paſſions, ſecures their intereſt through their
folly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:1058401600:174"/>
But we, ſir, are not to be thus impoſed upon.
We live in a large world, and have extended our
ideas beyond the limits and prejudices of an iſland.
We hold out the right hand of friendſhip to all the
univerſe, and we conceive there to be a ſociality in
the manners of France, which is much better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to peace and negociation than that of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and until the latter becomes more civilized,
ſhe cannot expect to live long at peace with any
power. Her common language is vulgar and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive,
and children, with their milk, ſuck in the
rudiments of inſult.—"The arm of Britain! The
mighty arm of Britain! Britain that ſhakes the
earth to its center and its poles! The ſcourge of
France! The terror of the world! That governs
with a nod, and pours down vengeance like a
God." This language neither makes a nation great
or little; but it ſhews a ſavageneſs of manners, and
has a tendency to keep national animoſity alive.
The entertainments of the ſtage are calculated to
the ſame end, and almoſt every public exhibition is
tinctured with inſult. Yet England is always in
dread of France. Terrified at the apprehenſion of
an invaſion. Suſpicious of being outwitted in a treaty
and privately cringing, though ſhe is publicly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending.
Let her therefore, reform her manners,
and do juſtice, and ſhe will find the idea of a natural
enemy, to be only a phantom of her own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:1058401600:175"/>
Little did I think, at this period of the war, to
ſee a proclamation which could promiſe you no one
uſeful purpoſe whatever, and tend only to expoſe
you. One would think you were juſt awakened
from a four years dream, and knew nothing of
what had paſſed in the interval. Is this a time to
be offering pardons, or renewing the long forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſubjects of charters and taxation? Is it worth
your while, after every force has failed you, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
under the ſhelter of argument and perſuaſion?
Or can you think that we, with nearly half your
army priſoners, and in alliance with France, are to
be begged or threatened into a ſubmiſſion by a
piece of paper? But as commiſſioners, at a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds ſterling a week each, you conceive
yourſelves bound to do ſomething, and the genius
of ill-fortune told you, you muſt write.</p>
            <p>For my own part I have not put pen to paper
theſe ſeveral months. Convinced of your ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
by the iſſue of every campaign, I was inclined
to hope, that that which all the reſt of the world
now ſee, would become viſible to you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
felt unwilling to ruffle your temper by fretting
you with repetitions and diſcoveries. There have
been intervals of heſitation in your conduct, from
which it ſeemed a pity to diſturb you, and a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to leave you to yourſelves. You have often
ſtopt, as if you intended to think, but your
thoughts have ever been too early or too late.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:1058401600:176"/>
There was a time when Britain diſdained to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
and even to hear a petition from America.
That time is paſt, and ſhe, in her turn, is petitioning
our acceptance. We now ſtand on higher ground,
and offer her peace; and the time will come, when
ſhe, perhaps in vain, will aſk it from us. The latter
caſe is as probable as the former ever was. She
cannot refuſe to acknowledge our independence
with greater obſtinacy than ſhe before refuſed to
repeal her laws; and if America alone could bring
her to the one, united with France ſhe will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
her to the other. There is ſomething in
obſtinacy which differs from every other paſſion,
whenever it fails it never recovers, but either breaks
like iron, or crumbles ſulkily away like a fractured
arch. Moſt other paſſions have their periods of
fatigue and reſt; their ſufferings and their cure;
but obſtinacy has no reſource, and the firſt wound
is mortal. You have already begun to give it
up, and you will, from the natural conſtruction
of the vice, find yourſelves both obliged and
inclined to do ſo.</p>
            <p>If you look back you ſee nothing but loſs
and diſgrace. If you look forward, the ſame
ſcene continues, and the cloſe is an impenetrable
gloom. You may plan and execute little miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
but are they worth the expence they coſt
you, or will ſuch partial evils have any effect
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1058401600:177"/>
on the general cauſe? Your expedition to Egg-Harbour,
will be felt at a diſtance like an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
upon a hen-rooſt, and expoſe you in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
with a ſort of childiſh phrenſy. It is well
worth while to keep an army to protect you in
writing proclamations, or to get once a year
into winter quarters? Poſſeſſing yourſelves of
towns is not conqueſt, but convenience, and in
which you will, one day or the other, be tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panned.
Your retreat from Philadelphia was
only a timely eſcape, and your next expedition
may be leſs fortunate.</p>
            <p>It would puzzle all the politicians in the univerſe
to conceive what you ſtay for, or why you ſhould
have ſtaid ſo long. You are proſecuting a war
in which you confeſs you have neither object
nor hope, and that conqueſt, could it be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
would not repay the charges: In the mean
while, the reſt of your affairs are running into
ruin, and a European war kindled againſt you.
In ſuch a ſituation, there is neither doubt or
difficulty; the firſt rudiments of reaſon will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the choice, for if peace can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
with more advantages than even a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
can be obtained, he muſt be an ideot indeed
that heſitates.</p>
            <p>But you are probably buoyed up by a ſet of
wretched mortals, who, having deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
are cringing with the duplicity of a ſpaniel
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1058401600:178"/>
for a little temporary bread. Thoſe men will
tell you juſt what you pleaſe. It is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
to amuſe, in order to lengthen out their
protection. They ſtudy to keep you amongſt
them for that very purpoſe; and in proportion as
you diſregard their advice, and grow callous to
their complaints, they will ſtretch into improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and pepper off their flattery the higher.
Characters like theſe are to be found in every
country, and every country will deſpiſe them.</p>

            <p>THERE are ſtages in the buſineſs of ſerious life
in which to amuſe is cruel, but to deceive is
to deſtroy; and it is of little conſequence in the
concluſion, whether men deceive themſelves or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
by a kind of mutual conſent, to the impoſitions
of each other. That England has been long under
the influence of deluſion or miſtake, needs no other
proof than the unexpected and wretched ſituation
ſhe is now involved in: And ſo powerful has been
the influence, that no proviſion was ever made or
thought of againſt the misfortune, becauſe the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of its happening was never conceived.</p>
            <p>The general and ſucceſsful reſiſtance of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
the conqueſt of Burgoyne, and a war with
France, were treated in parliament as the dreams
of a diſcontented oppoſition, or a diſtempered ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
They were beheld as objects unworthy
of a ſerious thought, and the bare intimation of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1058401600:180"/>
them afforded the miniſtry a triumph of laughter.
Short triumph indeed! For every thing which has
been predicted has happened, and all that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
have failed. A long ſeries of politics ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
diſtinguiſhed by a ſucceſſion of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
without one alleviating turn, muſt certainly
have ſomething in it ſyſtematically wrong. It is
ſufficient to awaken the moſt credulous into ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
and moſt obſtinate into thought. Either the
means in your power are inſufficient, or the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
ill-planned; either the execution has been
bad, or the thing attempted impracticable; or to
ſpeak more emphatically, either you are not able,
or Heaven is not willing. For, why is it that you
have not conquered us? Who, or what has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
you? You have had every opportunity
you could deſire, and ſuccceded to your utmoſt
wiſh in every preparatory means. Your fleets and
armies have arrived in America without an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
No uncommon misfortune hath intervened.
No foreign nation hath interfered until the time
you had allotted for victory was paſt. The oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
either in or out of parliament, neither diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
your meaſures, retarded or diminiſhed your
force. They only foretold your ſate. Every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial
ſcheme was carried with as high a hand as
if the whole nation had been unanimous. Every
thing wanted was aſked for, and every thing aſked
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1058401600:181"/>
for was granted. A greater force was not within the
compaſs of your abilities to ſend, and the time you
ſent it was, of all others, the moſt favourable.
You were then at reſt with the whole world beſide.
You had the range of every court in Europe uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
by us. You amuſed us with a tale of
commiſſioners of peace, and under that diſguiſe
collected a numerous army and came almoſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
upon us. The force was much greater
than we looked for; and that which we had to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it with was unequal in numbers, badly armed
and poorly diſciplined; beſides which, it was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied
only for a ſhort time, and expired within
a few months after your arrival. We had govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to form; meaſures to concert; an army to
raiſe and train, and every neceſſary article to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
or to create. Our non-importation ſcheme had
exhauſted our ſtores, and your command by ſea,
intercepted our ſupplies. We were a people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
and unconnected with the political world,
and ſtrangers to the diſpoſition of foreign powers.
Could you poſſibly wiſh for a more favorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of circumſtances? Yet all theſe have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
and paſſed away, and, as it were, left you
with a laugh. They are likewiſe events of ſuch an
original nativity as can never happen again, unleſs
a new world ſhould ariſe from the ocean.</p>
            <p>If any thing can be a leſſon to preſumption,
ſurely the circumſtances of this war will have their
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1058401600:182"/>
effect. Had Britain been defeated by any Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean
power, her pride would have drawn conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the importance of her conquerors; but in
the preſent caſe, ſhe is excelled by thoſe ſhe affected
to deſpiſe, and her own opinion retorting on herſelf,
become an aggravation of her diſgrace. Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and experience are loſt upon mankind, when
they produce neither reflection nor reformation.
Evils, like poiſons, have their uſes, and there are
diſeaſes which no other remedy can reach. It has
been the crime and folly of England to ſuppoſe
herſelf invincible, and that, without acknowledging
or perceiving that a full third of her ſtrength was
drawn from the country ſhe is now at war with.
The arm of Britain has been ſpoken of as the arm
of the Almighty, and ſhe has lived of late, as if ſhe
thought the whole world created for her diverſion.
Her politics, inſtead of civilizing, has tended to
brutalize mankind, and under the vain unmeaning
title of "Defender of the Faith," ſhe has made
war, like an Indian, againſt the religion of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Her cruelties in the Eaſt Indies, will NEVER,
NEVER be forgotten; and, it is ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that the produce of that ruined country,
tranſported to America, ſhould there kindle up a
war, to puniſh the deſtroyer. The chain is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
though with a kind of myſterious uniformity,
both in the crime and the puniſhment. The latter
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1058401600:183"/>
runs parallel with the former; and time and fate
will give it a perfect illuſtration.</p>
            <p>Where information is withheld, ignorance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a reaſonable excuſe; and one would charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
hope, that the people of England do not encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
cruelty from choice, but from miſtake. Their
recluſe ſituation, ſurrounded by the ſea, preſerves
them from the calamities of war, and keeps them
in the dark as to the conduct of their own armies.
They ſee not, therefore they feel not. They tell
the tale that is told them, and believe it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to no other news than their own, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, ſtript of its horrors, and prepared for the
palate of the nation, through the channel of the
London Gazette. They are made to believe
that their generals and armies differ from thoſe of
other nations, and have nothing of rudeneſs or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
in them. They ſuppoſe them what they
wiſh them to be. They feel a diſgrace in thinking
otherwiſe, and naturally encourage the belief from
a partiality to themſelves. There was a time when
I felt the ſame prejudices, and reaſoned from the
ſame errors; but experience, ſad and painful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
has taught me better. What the conduct
of former armies was, I know not, but what the
conduct of the preſent is, I well know. It is low,
cruel, indolent, and proſſigate: and had the people
of America no other cauſe for ſeparation than what
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1058401600:184"/>
the army has occaſioned, that alone is cauſe
enough.</p>
            <p>The field of politics in England is far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
than that of news. Men have a right to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for themſelves, and though they cannot contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the intelligence in the London Gazette, they
can frame upon it what ſentiments they pleaſe.
But the misfortune is, that a general ignorance has
prevailed over the whole nation reſpecting Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.
The miniſtry and the minority have both been
wrong. The former was always ſo; the latter,
only lately ſo. Politics to be executively right,
muſt have a unity of means and time, and a defect
in either overthrows the whole. The miniſtry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
the plans of the minority while they were
practicable, and joined in them, when they became
impracticable. From wrong meaſures, they got
into wrong time, and have now completed the
circle of abſurdity by cloſing it upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>It was my fate to come to America a few months
before the breaking out of hoſtilities. I found the
diſpoſition of the people ſuch, that they might have
been led by a thread, and governed by a reed.
Their ſuſpicion was quick and penetrating, but
their attachment to Britain was obſtinate, and it
was, at that time, a kind of treaſon to ſpeak againſt
it. They diſliked the miniſtry, but they eſteemed
the nation. Their idea of grievance operated
without reſentment, and their ſingle object was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1058401600:185"/>
Bad as I believed the miniſtry to be,
I never conceived them capable of a meaſure ſo
raſh and wicked as the commencing of hoſtilities;
much leſs did I imagine the nation would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
it. I viewed the diſpute as a kind of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,
in which I ſuppoſed the parties would find a
way either to decide or ſettle it. I had no thoughts
of independence, or of arms. The world could
not then have perſuaded me, that I ſhould be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a ſoldier or an author. If I had any talents
for either, they were buried in me, and might ever
have continued ſo, had not the neceſſity of the
times dragged and driven them into action. I had
formed my plan of life, and conceiving myſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
wiſhed every body elſe ſo. But when the
country into which I had juſt put my foot, was ſet
on fire about my ears, it was time to ſtir. It
was time for every man to ſtir. Thoſe who had
been long ſettled and had ſomething to defend;
thoſe who had juſt come had ſomething to purſue;
and the call, and the concern was equal and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.
For in a country where all men were once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers,
the difference of a few years in their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
could make none in their right.</p>
            <p>The breaking out of hoſtilities, opened a new
ſuſpicion in the politics of America, which, though
at that time very rare, has been ſince proved to be
very right. What I allude to, is, "A ſecret and
fixt determination in the Britiſh cabinet to annex
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1058401600:186"/>
America to the crown of England as a conquered
country." If this be taken as the object, then the
whole line of conduct purſued by the miniſtry,
though raſh in its origin, and ruinous in its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
is nevertheleſs uniform and conſiſtent in
its parts. It applies to every caſe, and reſolves
every difficulty. But if taxation, or any thing elſe
taken in its room, then there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the object and the charge. Nothing but the
whole ſoil and property of the country can be
placed as a poſſible equivalent againſt the millions
which the miniſtry expended. No taxes raiſed in
America could poſſibly repay it. A revenue of
two millions ſterling a year, would not diſcharge
the ſum and intereſt accumulated thereon, in twenty
years.</p>
            <p>Reconciliation never appears to have been the
wiſh or the object of adminiſtration, they looked on
conqueſt as certain and infallible, and under that
perſuaſion, ſought to drive the Americans into what
they might ſtile, a general rebellion, and then
cruſhing them with arms in their hands, reap the
rich harveſt of a general confiſcation, and ſilence
them for ever. The dependants at court were too
numerous to be provided for in England. The
market for plunder in the Eaſt Indies were over;
and the profligacy of government required that a
a new mine ſhould be opened, and that mine,
could be no other than America conquered and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1058401600:187"/>
forfeited. They had no where elſe to go. Every
other channel was drained; and extravagance with
the thirſt of a drunkard, was gaping for ſupplies.</p>
            <p>If the miniſtry deny this to have been their plan,
it becomes them to explain what was their plan.
For either they have abuſed us in coveting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
they never laboured for, or they have abuſed
you in expending an amazing ſum upon an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
object. Taxation, as I mentioned before,
could never be worth the charge of obtaining it by
arms; and any kind of formal obedience which
America could have made, would have weighed
with the lightneſs of a laugh againſt ſuch a load of
expence. It is, therefore, moſt probable, that the
miniſtry will at laſt juſtify their policy by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty,
and openly declare, that their original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was conqueſt: And in this caſe, it well becomes
the people of England, to conſider how far the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would have been benefited by the ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>In a general view, there are few conqueſts that
repay the charge of making them, and mankind
are pretty well convinced, that it can never be
worth their while to go to war for profit ſake. If
they are made war upon, their country invaded, or
their exiſtence at ſtake, it is their duty to defend
and preſerve themſelves, but in every other light,
and from every other cauſe, is war inglorious and
deteſtable. But to return to the caſe in queſtion—</p>
            <p>When conqueſts are made of foreign countries,
it is ſuppoſed that the COMMERCE and DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINION
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1058401600:188"/>
of the country which made them are
extended. But this could neither be the object
nor the conſequence of the preſent war. You en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
the whole commerce before. It could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no poſſible addition by a conqueſt, but on
the contrary, muſt diminiſh as the inhabitants were
reduced in numbers and wealth. You had the
DOMINION over the country which you uſed
to have, and had no complaint to make againſt her
for breach of any part of the compact between you
and her, or contending againſt any eſtabliſhed cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
commercial, political or territorial. The
country and commerce were both your own when
you BEGAN to conquer, in the ſame manner
and form as they had been your own an hundred
years before. Nations have ſometimes been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to make conqueſts for the ſake only of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the power of their enemies, or bringing it
to a balance with their own. But this could be no
part of your plan. No foreign authority was
claimed here, neither was any ſuch authority ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by you, or acknowledged, or imagined by
us. What then, in the name of heaven, could
you go to war for? or what chance could you
poſſibly have in the event, but either to hold the
ſame country which you held before, and that in a
much worſe condition, or to loſe with an amazing
expence, what you might have retained without a
farthing charges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:1058401600:189"/>
War never can be the intereſt of a trading nation,
any more than quarrelling can be profitable to a
man in buſineſs. But to make war with thoſe
who trade with us, is like ſetting a bull-dog upon
a cuſtomer at the ſhop door. The leaſt degree
of common ſenſe ſhews the madneſs of the latter,
and it will apply with the ſame force of conviction
to the former. Piratical nations, having neither
commerce or commodities of their own to loſe,
may make war upon all the world, and lucratively
find their account in it. But it is quite otherwiſe
with Britain. For, beſides the ſtoppage of trade in
time of war, ſhe expoſes more of her own property
to be loſt, than ſhe has the chance of taking from
others. Some miniſterial gentlemen in parliament
have mentioned the greatneſs of her trade, as an
apology for the greatneſs of her loſs. This is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
politics indeed! becauſe, it ought to have been
given as a reaſon for her not engaging in a war at
firſt. The coaſt of America commands the Weſt
India trade, almoſt as effectually as the coaſt of
Africa does that of the Streights, and England can
no more carry to the former, without the conſent
of America, than ſhe can the latter without a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean
paſs.</p>
            <p>In whatever light the war with America is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
upon commercial principles, it is evidently
the intereſt of the people of England not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it; and why it has been ſupported ſo long
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1058401600:190"/>
againſt the cleareſt demonſtrations of truth and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
advantage, is to me, and muſt be to all the
reaſonable world, a matter of actoniſhment. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
it may be ſaid, that I live in America, and
write this from intereſt. To this I reply, that my
principles are univerſal. My attachment is to all
the world, and not to any particular part, and if
what I advance is right, no matter where, or who
it comes from. We have given the proclamation
of your commiſſioners a currency in our newſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and I have no doubt but you will give this a
place in yours. To oblige and be obliged is fair.</p>
            <p>Before I diſmiſs this part of my addreſs, I ſhall
mention one more circumſtance in which I think
the people of England have been equally miſtaken;
and then proceed to other matter.</p>
            <p>There is ſuch an idea exiſting in the world, as
that of NATIONAL HONOUR, and this
falſely underſtood, is oftentimes the cauſe of war. In
a chriſtian and philoſophical ſenſe, mankind ſeem
to have ſtood ſtill at individual civilization, and
to retain as nations, all the original rudeneſs of
nature. Peace by treaty, is only a ceſſation of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
for a reformation of ſentiment. It is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
for a principle that is wanting, and ever will
be wanting till the idea of NATIONAL HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOUR
be rightly underſtood. As individuals,
we profeſs ourſelves chriſtians, but as nations, we are
heathens, Romans, and what not. I remember the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1058401600:191"/>
late Admiral Saunders declaring in the Houſe of
Commons, and that in the time of peace, "That
the city of Madrid laid in aſhes, was not a ſufficient
atonement for the Spaniards taking off the rudder of
an Engliſh ſloop of war." I do not aſk whether
this is chriſtianity or morality, I aſk whether it is
decency? whether it is proper language for a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to uſe? In private life we ſhould call it by the
plain name of bullying, and the elevation of rank
cannot alter its character. It is, I think, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
eaſy to define, what ought to be underſtood by
national honour, for that which is the beſt character
for an individual, is the beſt character for a nation;
and wherever the latter exceeds or falls beneath
the former, there is a departure from the line of
true greatneſs.</p>
            <p>I have thrown out this obſervation with a deſign
of applying it to Great Britain. Her idea of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
honour ſeems devoid of that benevolence of
heart, that univerſal expanſion of philanthropy,
and that triumph over the rage of vulgar prejudice,
without which, man is inferior to himſelf, and a
companion of common animals. To know whom
ſhe ſhall regard or diſlike, ſhe aſks what country
they are of, what religion they profefs, and what
property they enjoy. Her idea of national honour
ſeems to conſiſt in national inſult, and that to be a
great people, is to be neither a chriſtian, a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
or a gentleman, but to threaten with the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1058401600:192"/>
of a bear, and to devour with the ferocity of a
lion. This, perhaps, may found harſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtly,
but it is too true, and the more is the pity.</p>
            <p>I mention this only as her general character.
But towards America ſhe has obſerved no character
at all, and deſtroyed by her conduct what ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
in her title. She ſet out with the title of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
or Mother Country. The aſſociation of ideas
which naturally accompany this expreſſion, are
filled with every thing that is fond, tender, and
forbearing. They have an energy particular to
themſelves, and overlooking the accidental attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of common affections, apply with peculiar
ſoftneſs to the firſt feelings of the heart. It is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
term which every mother can feel the force
of, and every child can judge of. It needs no
painting of mine to ſet it off, for nature only
can do it juſtice.</p>
            <p>But has any part of your conduct to America
correſponded with the title you ſet up? If in your
general national character you are unpoliſhed and
ſevere, in this you are inconſiſtent and unnatural,
and you muſt have exceeding falſe notions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
honour, to ſuppoſe that the world can admire
a want of humanity, or that national honour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on the violence of reſentment, the inflexibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of temper, or the vengeance of execution.</p>
            <p>I would willingly convince you, and that with as
much temper as the times will ſuffer me to do,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1058401600:193"/>
that as you oppoſed your own intereſt by quarrelling
with us, ſo likewiſe your national honour, rightly
conceived and underſtood, was no ways called upon
to enter into a war with America; had you ſtudied
true greatneſs of heart, the firſt and faireſt ornament
of mankind, you would have acted directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all that you have done, and the world would
have aſcribed it to a generous cauſe; beſides which,
you had (though with the aſſiſtance of this country)
ſecured a powerful name by the laſt war. You
were known and dreaded abroad; and it would have
been wiſe in you to have ſuffered the world to have
ſlept undiſturbed under that idea. It was to you a
force exiſting without expence. It produced to you
all the advantages of real power, and you were
ſtronger through the univerſality of that charm
than any future fleets and armies may probably make
you. Your greatneſs was ſo ſecured and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
with your ſilence, that you ought never to
have awakened mankind, and had nothing to do
but to be quiet. Had you been true politicians
you would have ſeen all this, and continued to draw
from the magic of a name, the force and authority,
of a nation.</p>
            <p>Unwiſe as you were in breaking the charm, you
were ſtill more unwiſe in the manner of doing of
it. Samſon only told the ſecret, but you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the operation; you have ſhaven your own
head, and wantonly thrown away the locks. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1058401600:194"/>
was the hair from which the charm was
drawn that infatuated the world. You ought to
have quarrelled with no power; but with her upon
no account. You had nothing to fear from any
condeſcenſion you might make. You might have
humoured her, even if there had been no juſtice in
her claims, without any riſk to your reputation;
for Europe faſcinated by your ſame, would have
aſcribed it to your benovolence, and America, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated
by the great, would have ſlumbered in
her fetters.</p>
            <p>But this method of ſtudying the progreſs of the
paſſions, in order to aſcertain the probable conduct
of mankind, is a philoſophy in politics, which thoſe
who preſide at St. James's have no conception of.
They know no other influence than corruption,
and reckon all their probabilities from precedent.
A new caſe, is to them a new world, and while
they are ſeeking for a parallel, they get loſt. The
talents of Lord Mansfield can be eſtimated, at beſt,
no higher than thoſe of a ſophiſt. He underſtands
the ſubtleties, but not the elegance of nature? and
by continually viewing mankind through the cold
medium of the law, never thinks of penetrating
into the warmer region of the mind. As for Lord
North, it is his happineſs to have in him more phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
than ſentiment, for he bears flogging like a
top, and ſleeps the better for it. His puniſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
his ſupport, for while he ſuffers the laſh for
his ſins, he keeps himſelf up by twirling about. In
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1058401600:195"/>
politics, he is a good arithmetician, and in every
thing elſe, nothing at all.</p>
            <p>There is one circumſtance which comes ſo much
within Lord North's province as a financier, that I
am ſurpriſed it ſhould eſcape him, which is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
abilities of the two countries in ſupporting the
expence; for, ſtrange as it may ſeem, England is
not a match for America in this particular. By a
curious kind of revolution in accounts, the people
of England ſeem to miſtake their poverty for their
riches, that is, they reckon their national debt as
part of their national wealth. They make the ſame
kind of error which a man would do, who, after
mortgaging his eſtate, ſhould add the money bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
to the full value on the eſtate, in order to
count up his worth, and in this caſe, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
that he got rich by running into debt. Juſt
thus it is with England. The government owed
at the beginning of this war, one hundred and thirty
five millions ſterling, and though the individuals
to whom it was due, had a right to reckon their
ſhares as ſo much private property, yet to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
collectively, it was ſo much poverty. There
is as effectual limits to public debts as to private
ones, for when once the money borrowed is ſo great
as to require the whole yearly revenue to diſcharge
the intereſt thereon, there is an end to a farther bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing;
in the ſame manner as when the intereſt
of a man's debts amounts to the yearly income of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1058401600:196"/>
his eſtate, there is an end to his credit, This is
nearly the caſe with England; the intereſt of her
preſent debt being at leaſt equal to one half of her
yearly revenue, ſo that out of ten millions annually
collected by taxes, ſhe has but five ſhe can call her
own.</p>
            <p>The very reverſe of this was the caſe with Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;
ſhe began the war without any debt upon her,
and in order to carry it on, ſhe neither raiſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
by taxes, nor borrowed it upon intereſt, but
created it; and her ſituation at this time, continues
ſo much the reverſe of yours, that taxing would
make her rich, whereas it would make you poor.
When we ſhall have ſunk the ſum which we have
created, we ſhall then be out of debt, be juſt as
rich as when we began, and all the while we are
doing it, ſhall feel no difference, becauſe the
value will riſe, as the quantity decreaſes.</p>
            <p>There was not a country in the world, ſo capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of bearing the expence of a war, as America;
not only, becauſe, ſhe was not in debt when ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
but becauſe the country is young, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of infinite improvement, and has an almoſt
boundleſs tract of new lands in ſtore, whereas, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
has got to her extent of age and growth, and
has no unoccupied land, or property in reſerve.
The one is like a young heir, coming to a large im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable
eſtate, the other like an old man whoſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1058401600:197"/>
chances are over, and his eſtate mortgaged for half
its worth.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond number of the Criſis, which I find
has been re-publiſhed in England, I endeavoured to
to ſet forth the impracticability of conquering
America. I ſtated every caſe, that I conceived
could poſſibly happen, and ventured to predict its
conſequence. As my concluſions were drawn not
artfully, but naturally, they have all proved to be
true. I was upon the ſpot; knew the politics of
America, her ſtrength, and reſources; and, by a
train of ſervices, the beſt in my power to render, was
honoured with the friendſhip of the congreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and the people. I conſidered the cauſe a juſt one.
I know and feel it a juſt one, and under that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
never made my own profit or loſs an object.
My endeavour was to have the matter well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
on both ſides, and I conceived myſelf tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a general ſervice, by ſetting forth to the one
the impoſſibility of being conquered, and to the
other, the impoſſibility of conquering. Moſt of
the arguments made uſe of by the miniſtry for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the war, are the very arguments that ought
to have been uſed againſt ſupporting it; and the
plans, by which they thought to conquer, are the
very plans, in which they were ſure to be defeated.
They have taken every thing up at the wrong end.
Their ignorance is aſtoniſhing, and were you in my
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1058401600:198"/>
ſituation you would ſee it. They may, perhaps,
have your confidence, but I am perſuaded, they
would make very indifferent members of congreſs.
I know what England is, and what America is,
and from the compound of knowledge, am better
enabled to judge of the iſſue, than what the king or
any of his miniſters can be.</p>
            <p>In this number, I have endeavoured to ſhew the
ill policy and diſadvantages of the war. I believe
many of my remarks are new. Thoſe which are
not ſo, I have ſtudied to improve, and place in a
manner that may be clear and ſtriking, Your fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
is, I am perſuaded, as certain as fate. America
is above your reach. She is, at leaſt, your equal
in the world, and her independance, neither reſts
upon your conſent, or can be prevented by your
arms. In ſhort, you ſpend your ſubſtance in vain,
and impoveriſh yourſelf without a hope.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe you had conquered America, what
advantage collectively or individually, as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
manufacturers, or conquerors, could you
have looked for. This is an object you ſeem
never to have attended to. Liſtening for the
ſound of victory, and led away by the phrenzy of
arms, you neglected to reckon either the coſt or
the conſequences. You muſt all pay towards the
expence; the pooreſt among you muſt bear his
ſhare, and it is both your right and duty to
weigh ſeriouſly the matter. Had America been
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1058401600:199"/>
conquered, ſhe might have been parcelled out in
grants to the favourites at court, but no ſhare of
it would have fallen to you. Your taxes would not
have been leſſened, becauſe, ſhe would have been in
no condition to have paid any towards your relief.
We are rich by a contrivance of our own, which
would have ceaſed, as ſoon as you became maſters.
Our Paper money will be of no uſe in England, and
ſilver and gold we have none. In the laſt war you
made many conqueſts, but were any of your taxes
leſſened thereby? On the contrary, were you not
taxed to pay for the charge of making them, and
have not the ſame been the caſe in every war?</p>
            <p>To the parliament, I beg to addreſs myſelf in a
particular manner They appear to have ſuppoſed
themſelves partners in the chace, and to have hunted
with the lion from an expectation of a right in
the booty; but in this, it is moſt probably they
would, as legiſlators, have been diſappointed.
The caſe is quite a new one, and many unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
difficulties would have ariſen thereon. The
parliament claimed a legiſlative right over America,
and the war originated from that pretence. But
the army is ſuppoſed to belong to the crown, and
if America had been conquered through their
means, the claims of the legiſlature would have
been ſuffocated in the conqueſt. Ceded, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
countries, are ſuppoſed to be out of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1058401600:200"/>
of parliament. Taxation is exerciſed over
them by prerogative and not by law. It was attempted
to be done in the Grenades a few years ago, and the
only reaſon why it was not done, was, becauſe, the
crown had made a prior relinquiſhment of its claim.
Therefore, parliament have been all this while ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
meaſures for the eſtabliſhment of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
in the iſſue of which, they would have been
triumphed over by prerogative. This might have
opened a new and intereſting oppoſition between
the parliament and the crown. The crown would
have ſaid that it conquered for itſelf, and that to
conquer for parliament was an unknown caſe.
The parliament might have replied, that America
not being a foreign country, but a country in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
could not be ſaid to be conquered, but reduced;
and thus continued their claim, by diſowning the
term. The crown might have rejoined, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
America might be conſidered at firſt, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
foreign at laſt, by a declaration of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and a treaty with France; and that her caſe
being by that treaty, put within the law of nations,
was out of the law of parliament. The parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might have maintained, that as their claim
over America had never been ſurrendered, ſo neither
could it be taken away. The crown might have
inſiſted, that though the claim of parliament could
not be taken away yet being an inferior, might be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1058401600:201"/>
ſuperceded; and that, whether the claim was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
from the object, or the object taken from the
claim, the ſame ſeparation enſued; and that America
being ſubdued after a treaty with France, was to all
intents and purpoſes a regal conqueſt, and of courſe
the ſole property of the king. The parliament, as
the legal delegates of the people, might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt the term "inferior," and reſted the
caſe upon the antiquity of power; and this would
have brought on a ſet of very intereſting and ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
queſtions.<list>

            <p>In ſhort, the contention about the dividend
might have diſtracted the nation; for nothing is
more common than to agree in the conqueſt and
quarrel for the prize; therefore it is, perhaps, a
happy circumſtance, that our ſucceſſes have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the diſpute.</p>
            <p>If the parliament had been thrown out in their
claim, which it is moſt probable they would, the
nation likewiſe would have been thrown out in their
expectation; for as the taxes would have been laid
by the crown, without the parliament, the revenue
ariſing therefrom, if any could have aroſe, would
not have gone into the exchequer, but into the
privy purſe, and ſo far from leſſening the taxes,
would not even have been added to them, but
ſerved only as pocket money to the crown. The
more I reflect on this matter, the more I am aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed
at the blindneſs and ill-policy of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,
whoſe wiſdom ſeems to operate without
diſcernment, and their ſtrength without an object.</p>
            <p>To the great bulwark of the nation, I mean the
mercantile and manufacturing part thereof, I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
preſent my addreſs. It is your intereſt to ſee
America an independent country, and not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
one. If conquered, ſhe is ruined; and if
ruined, poor; conſequently the trade will be a
trifle, and her credit doubtful. If independent,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1058401600:203"/>
ſhe flouriſhes, and from her flouriſhing, muſt your
profits ariſe. It matters nothing to you, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
America, if your manufactures find a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
there. Some articles will conſequently
be obtained from other places, and right they ſhould;
but the demand of others, will increaſe by the great
influx of inhabitants which a ſtate of independence and
peace will occaſion, and on the final event you may
be enriched. The commerce of America is perfectly
free, and ever will be ſo. She will conſign away
no part of it to any nation. She has not to her
friends, and certainly will not to her enemies,
though it is probable that your narrow-minded poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,
thinking to pleaſe you thereby, may ſome
time or other make ſuch an unneceſſary propoſal.
Trade flouriſhes beſt when it is free, and it is weak
policy to attempt to fetter it. Her treaty with
France is on the moſt liberal and generous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and the French in their conduct towards her,
have proved themſelves to be philoſophers, politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
and gentlemen.</p>
            <p>To the miniſtry I likewiſe addreſs myſelf. You,
gentlemen, have ſtudied the ruin of your country,
from which it is not within your abilities to reſcue
her. Your attempts to recover are as ridiculous as
your plans, which involved her, are deteſtable.
The commiſſioners being about to depart, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
bring you this, and with it my ſixth number
to them; and in ſo doing they carry back more
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1058401600:204"/>
COMMON SENSE than they brought, and you
will likewiſe have more than when you ſent them.</p>
            <p>Having thus addreſſed you ſeverally, I conclude
by addreſſing you collectively. It is a long lane
that has no turning. A period of ſixteen years of
miſconduct and misfortune, is certainly long enough
for any one nation to ſuffer under; and upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
that war is not declared between France
and you, I beg to place a line of conduct before
you that will eaſily lead you out of all your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
It has been hinted before, and cannot be too
much attended to.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe America had remained unknown to
Europe till the preſent year, and that Mr. Banks
and Dr. Solander, in another voyage round the
world, had made the firſt diſcovery of her in the
ſelf ſame condition ſhe is now in, of arts, arms,
numbers, and civilization. What, I aſk, in that
caſe, would have been your conduct towards her,
for THAT will point out what it ought to be
now? The problems and their ſolutions are
equal, and the right line of the one is the parallel of
the other. The queſtion takes in every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that can poſſibly ariſe. It reduces politics to
a ſimple thought, and is moreover a mode of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation,
in which, while you are ſtudying your
intereſt, the ſimplicity of the caſe will cheat you into
good temper. You have nothing to do but to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you have found America, and ſhe appears
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1058401600:205"/>
found to your hand, and, while in the joy of your
heart you ſtand ſtill to admire her, the path of
politics riſes ſtraight before you.</p>
            <p>Were I diſpoſed to paint a contraſt, I could eaſily
ſet off what you have done in the preſent caſe
againſt what you would have done in THAT caſe,
and, by juſtly oppoſing them, conclude a picture
that would make you bluſh. But, as when any of
the prouder paſſions are hurt, it is much better phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
to let a man ſlip into a good temper, than
to attack him in a bad one; for that reaſon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I only ſtate the caſe, and leave yourſelves to
reflect upon it.</p>
            <p>To go a little back into politics, it will be found
that the true intereſts of Britain lay in propoſing and
promoting the independence of America immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after the laſt peace; for the expence which
Britain had then incurred by defending America,
as her own dominions, ought to have ſhewn her the
policy and neceſſity of changing the STILE of the
country, as the beſt probable method of preventing
future wars and expence, and the only method by
which ſhe could hold the commerce without the
charge of ſovereignty. Beſides which, the title
ſhe aſſumed of parent country, led to, and pointed
out, the propriety, wiſdom and advantage of a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
for as in private life, children grow into
men, and, by ſetting up for themſelves, extend and
ſecure the intereſt of the whole family, ſo in the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1058401600:206"/>
ſettlement of colonies large enough to admit of
maturity, the ſame policy ſhould be purſued, and
the ſame conſequences would follow. Nothing
hurts the affections both of parents and children
ſo much, as living too cloſely connected, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the diſtinction too long. Domineering will
not do over thoſe, who by a progreſs in life are
become equal in rank to their parents, that is, when
they have families of their own; and though they
may conceive themſelves the ſubjects of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
will not ſuppoſe them the objects of their
government. I do not, by drawing this parallel,
mean to admit the title of PARENT COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRY,
becauſe, if due any where, it is due to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
collectively, and the firſt ſettlers from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
were driven here by proſecution. I mean
only to introduce the term for the ſake of policy,
and to ſhow from your title, the line of your
intereſt.</p>
            <p>When you ſaw the ſtate of ſtrength and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and that by her own induſtry, which America
had arrived at, you ought to have adviſed her to
have ſet up for herſelf, and propoſed an alliance of
intereſt with her, and, in ſo doing, you would have
drawn, and that at her own expence, more real ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and more military ſupplies and aſſiſtance,
both of ſhips and men, than from any weak and
wrangling government you could exerciſe over her.
In ſhort, had you ſtudied only the domeſtic poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1058401600:207"/>
of a family, you would have learned how to
govern the ſtate; but, inſtead of this eaſy and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
line, you flew out into every thing which was
wild and outrageous, till by following the paſſion
and ſtupidity of the pilot, you wrecked the veſſel
within ſight of the ſhore.</p>
            <p>Having ſhown what you ought to have done, I
now proceed to ſhew the reaſon why it was not done.
The caterpillar circle of the court, had an intereſt
to purſue diſtinct from, and oppoſed to yours, for
though by the independence of America, and an
alliance therewith, the trade would have continued,
if not increaſed, as in many articles neither country
can go to a better market, and, though by defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and protecting herſelf, ſhe would have been no
expence to you, and conſequently your national
charges would have decreaſed, and your taxes might
have been proportionally leſſened thereby; yet the
ſtriking off ſo many places from the court calendar
was put in oppoſition to the intereſt of the nation.
The loſs of thirteen government ſhips, with their
appendages here and in England, is a ſhocking
ſound in the ear of a hungry courtier. <hi>Your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
king and miniſter will be the ruin of you; and
you had better riſk a revolution and call a congreſs,
than be thus led on from madneſs to deſpair, and
from deſpair to ruin. America has ſet you the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and may you follow it and be ſree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:1058401600:208"/>
I now come to the laſt part—a war with France.
This is what no man in his ſenſes will adviſe you to,
and all good men would wiſh to prevent. Whether
France will declare war againſt you, is not for me
in this place to mention, or to hint even if I knew
it, but it muſt be madneſs in you to do it firſt.
The matter is now come to a full criſis, and peace
is eaſy, if willingly ſet about. Whatever you may
think, France has behaved handſomely to you.
She would have been unjuſt to herſelf to have acted
otherwiſe than ſhe did; and having accepted our
offer of alliance, ſhe gave you genteel notice of it.
There was nothing in her conduct reſerved or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicate;
and, while ſhe announced her determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſupport her treaty, ſhe left you to give the
firſt offence. America, on her part, has exhibited
a character of firmneſs to the world. Unprepared
and unarmed, without form or government, ſhe
ſingly oppoſed a nation that domineered over half
the globe. The greatneſs of the deed demands
reſpect; and, though you may feel reſentment, you
are compelled both to WONDER and AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIRE.</p>
            <p>Here I reſt my arguments, and finiſh my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
ſuch as it is: it is a gift, and you are welcome.
It was always my deſign to dedicate a CRISIS to
you, when the time ſhould come that would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
MAKE IT A CRISIS; and when, likewiſe,
I ſhould catch myſelf in a temper to write it, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1058401600:209"/>
ſuppoſe you in a condition to read it. THAT
time is now arrived, and with it the opportunity of
conveyance. For the commiſſioners—POOR
COMMISSIONERS! having proclaimed, that
"YET FORTY DAYS AND NINEVEH
SHALL BE OVERTHROWN" have waited
out the date, and, diſcontented with their God, are
returning to their gourd. And all the harm I wiſh
them, is, that it may not WITHER about their
cars, and that they may not make their exit in the
belly of a whale.</p>

               <p>P.S. Though, in the tranquility of my mind, I
have concluded with a laugh, yet I have ſomething
to mention to the COMMISSIONERS, which to
them is ſerious, and worthy their attention. Their
authority is derived from an act of parliament,
which likewiſe deſcribes and LIMITS their OF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICIAL
powers. Their commiſſion, therefore,
is only a recital, and perſonal inveſtiture, of thoſe
powers, or a nomination and deſcription of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who are to execute them. Had it contained
any thing contrary to, or gone beyond the line of,
the written law from which it is derived and by
which it is bound, it would, by the Engliſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
have been treaſon in the crown, and the
king been ſubject to an impeachment. He dared
not, therefore, put in his commiſſion what you
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1058401600:210"/>
have put in your proclamation, that is, he dared not
have authoriſed you, in that commiſſion, to burn
and deſtroy, or to threaten to burn and deſtroy, any
thing in America. You are both in the ACT, and
in the COMMISSION, ſtiled COMMISSION<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERS
FOR RESTORING PEACE, and the
methods for doing it are there pointed out. Your
laſt proclamation is ſigned by you, as commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
UNDER THAT ACT. You make parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the patron of its contents. Yet in the body
of it, you inſert matters contrary both to the ſpirit
and letter of the act, and what likewiſe your king
dared not have put in his commiſſion to you. The
ſtate of things in England, gentlemen, is too tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
for you to run hazards. You are ACCOUNT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ABLE
TO PARLIAMENT FOR THE EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ECUTION
OF THAT ACT ACCORDING
TO THE LETTER OF IT. Your heads may
pay for breaking it, for you certainly have broke it
by exceeding it. And as a friend, who would wiſh
you to eſcape the paw of the lion as well as the
belly of the whale, I civilly hint to you, TO
KEEP WITHIN COMPASS.</p>
               <p>Sir Harry Clinton, ſtrictly ſpeaking, is as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
as the reſt; though a general, he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a commiſſioner, acting under a ſuperior autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
His firſt obedience is to the act; and his plea
of being a general, will not and cannot clear him as
a commiſſioner, for that would ſuppoſe the crown,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1058401600:211"/>
in its ſingle capacity, to have the power of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with a ſingle act of parliament. Your ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
gentlemen, are nice and critical, and the
more ſo, becauſe England is unſettled. Take
heed! Remember the times of Charles the Firſt!
For Laud and Stafford fell by truſting to a hope
like yours.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſhewn you the danger of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
I now ſhew you the folly of it. The
means contradict the deſign. You threaten to
lay waſte, in order to render America a uſeleſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
of alliance to France. I reply, that the
more deſtruction you commit, (if you could do it,)
the more valuable to France you make that alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
You can deſtroy only houſes and goods;
and by ſo doing you encreaſe our demand upon
her for materials and merchandize; for the wants
of one nation, provided it has FREEDOM and
CREDIT, naturally produces riches to the other;
and as you can neither ruin the land, nor prevent
the vegetation, you would encreaſe the exportation
of our produce in payment, which, to her, would
be a new fund of wealth. In ſhort, had you caſt
about for a plan on purpoſe to enrich your enemies,
you could not have hit upon a better.</p>

            <p>"TRUSTING, (ſays the king of England in
his ſpeech of November laſt) in the Divine
Providence, and in the juſtice of my cauſe, I am
firmly reſolved to proſecute the war with vigour,
and to make every exertion in order to compel
our enemies to equitable terms of peace and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation." To this declaration the United
States of America, and the confederated powers of
Europe, will reply, <hi>if Britain will have war, ſhe
ſhall have enough of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Five years have nearly elapſed ſince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
of hoſtilities, and every campaign, by
a gradual decay, has leſſened your ability to conquer,
without producing a ſerious thought on your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or your fate. Like a prodigal lingering in an
habitual conſumption, you feel the relics of life, and
miſtake them for recovery. New ſchemes, like
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1058401600:213"/>
new medicines, have adminiſtered freſh hopes, and
prolonged the diſeaſe inſtead of curing it. A
change of generals, like a change of phyſicians,
ſerved only to keep the flattery alive, and furniſh
new pretences for new extravagance.</p>

               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ode at the inſtallation of lord North, for chancellor of the Univerſity of Oxford.</note>," has been given
with the ſolemnity of prophetic confidence, and
though the queſtion has been conſtantly replied to
by diſappointment, and the prediction falſified by
misfortune, yet ſtill the inſult continued, and your
catalogue of national evils encreaſed therewith.
Eager to perſuade the world of her power, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
deſtruction as the miniſter of greatneſs, and
conceived that the glory of a nation, like that of an
Indian, lay in the number of its ſcalps, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
it inflicts.</p>
            <p>Fire, ſword and want, as far as the arms of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
could extend them, have been ſpread with
wanton cruelty along the coaſt of America; and
while you, remote from the ſcene of ſuffering, had
nothing to loſe, and as little to dread, the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
reached you like a tale of antiquity, in which
the diſtance of time defaces the conception, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1058401600:214"/>
changes the ſevereſt ſorrows into converſable amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>This makes the ſecond paper, addreſſed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in vain, to the people of England. That ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
ſhould be taken, wherever example has
failed, or precept be regarded, where warning is
ridiculed, is like a picture of hope reſting on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair:
But when time ſhall ſtamp with univerſal
currency, the facts you have long encountered with
a laugh, and the irreſiſtable evidence of accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
loſſes, like the hand writing on the wall, ſhall
add terror to diſtreſs, you will then, in a conflict of
ſufferings, learn to ſympathize with others by feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for yourſelves.</p>
            <p>The triumphant appearance of the combined
fleets in the channel, and at your harbour's mouth,
and the expedition of captain Paul Jones, on the
weſtern and eaſtern coaſt of England and Scotland,
will, by placing you in the condition of an endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
country, read to you a ſtronger lecture on the
calamities of invaſion, and bring to your minds a
truer picture of promiſcuous diſtreſs, than the moſt
finiſhed rhetoric can deſcribe, or the keeneſt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
can conceive.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, you have experienced the expences,
but nothing of the miſeries of war. Your diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments
have been accompanied with no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
ſuffering, and your loſſes came to you only
by intelligence. Like fire at a diſtance, you heard
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1058401600:215"/>
not even the cry; you felt not the danger, you ſaw
not the confuſion. To you, every thing has been
foreign, but the taxes to ſupport it. You knew
not what it was to be alarmed at midnight with an
armed enemy in the ſtreets. You were ſtrangers
to the diſtreſſing ſcene of a family in flight, and
the thouſand reſtleſs cares, and tender ſorrows that
inceſſantly aroſe. To ſee women and children
wandering in the ſeverity of winter with the broken
remains of a well furniſhed houſe, and ſeeking ſhelter
in every crib and hut, were matters you had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of. You knew not what it was to ſtand
by and ſee your goods chopt up for fuel, and your
beds ript to pieces to make packages for plunder.
The miſery of others, like a tempeſtuous night, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the pleaſures of your own ſecurity. You
even enjoyed the ſtorm, by contemplating the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of conditions, and that which carried ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
into the breaſt of thouſands, ſerved but to
heighten in you a ſpecies of tranquil pride.—Yet
theſe are but the fainter ſufferings of war, when
compared with carnage and ſlaughter, the miſeries
of a military hoſpital, or a town in flames.</p>
            <p>The people of America by anticipating diſtreſs,
had fortified their minds againſt every ſpecies you
could inflict. They had reſolved to abandon their
homes, to reſign them to deſtruction, and to ſeek
new ſettlements, rather than ſubmit. Thus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarized
to misfortune, before it arrived, they
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1058401600:216"/>
bore their portion with leſs regret: The juſtneſs
of their cauſe, was a continual ſource of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the hope of final victory, which never
left them, ſerved to lighten the load, and ſweeten
the cup allotted them to drink.</p>
            <p>But when their ſuffering ſhall become yours, and
invaſion be transferred to the invaders, you will
have neither an extended wilderneſs to fly to, their
cauſe to comfort you, nor their hopes to reſt
on. Diſtreſs with them was ſharpened with no
ſelf-reflection. They had not brought it on
themſelves. On the contrary, they had by every
proceeding endeavoured to avoid it, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
even below the mark of congreſſional
character to prevent a war. The national honour,
or the advantages of independence, were matters,
which, at the commencement of the diſpute, they
had never ſtudied, and it was only at the laſt moment
that the meaſure was reſolved on. Thus circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced,
they naturally and conſcientiouſly felt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon Providence. They had a clear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to it, and had they failed therein, infidelity
had gained a triumph.</p>
            <p>But your condition is the reverſe of theirs.
Every thing you ſuffer you have ſought; nay, had
you created miſchiefs on purpoſe to inherit them,
you could not have ſecured your title by a firmer
deed. The world awakens with no pity at your
complaints. You felt none for others; you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1058401600:217"/>
none for yourſelves. Nature doth not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
herſelf in caſes like yours, but, on the contrary,
turns from them with diſlike, and abandons them
to puniſhment. You may now preſent memorials
to what court you pleaſe, but ſo far as America is
the object, none will liſten. The policy of Europe,
and the propenſity there isin every mind to curb
inſulting ambition, and bring cruelty to judgment,
are unitedly againſt you; and where nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
reinforces each other, the compact is too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
to be diſſolved.</p>
            <p>Make but the caſe of others your own, and your
own theirs, and you will then have a clear idea of
the whole. Had France acted towards her colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
as you have done, you would have branded
her with every epithet of abhorrence; and had you
like her, ſtept in to ſuccour a ſtruggling people, all
Europe muſt have echoed with your own applauſes.
But entangled in the paſſion of diſpute, you ſee it
not as you ought, and form opinions thereon which
ſuit with no intereſt but your own. You wonder
America does not riſe in union with you to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
on herſelf a portion of your taxes, and
reduce herſelf to unconditional ſubmiſſion.
You are amazed that the ſouthern powers of Europe
do not aſſiſt you in conquering a country, which is
afterwards to be turned againſt themſelves; and
that the northern ones do not contribute to reinſtate
you in America, who already enjoy the market for
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1058401600:218"/>
naval ſtores by the ſeparation. You ſeem ſurprized
that Holland does not pour in her ſuccours, to
maintain you miſtreſs of the ſeas, when her own
commerce is ſuffering by your act of navigation,
or that any country ſhould ſtudy her own intereſts
while yours is on the carpet.</p>
            <p>Such exceſſes of paſſionate folly, and unjuſt, as
well as unwiſe reſentment, have driven you on,
like Pharoah, to unpitied miſeries, and while
the importance of the quarrel ſhall perpetuate your
diſgrace, the flag of America will carry it round
the world. The natural feelings of every rational
being will take againſt you, and wherever the ſtory
ſhall be told, you will have neither excuſe nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
left. With an unſparing hand, and an unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
mind, you have havocked the world, both to
gain dominion, and to loſe it; and while in a phrenzy
of avarice and ambition, the eaſt and the weſt are
doomed to tributary bondage, you rapidly earned
deſtruction as the wages of a nation.</p>
            <p>At the thoughts of a war at home, every man
amongſt you ought to tremble. The proſpect is far
more dreadful there than in America. Here the party
that was againſt the meaſures of the continent,
were, in general, a kind of neutrals, who added
ſtrength to neither army. There does not exiſt a
being ſo devoid of ſenſe and ſentiment as to covet
"UNCONDITIONAL SUBMISSION," and
therefore no man in America could be with you in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1058401600:219"/>
principle. Several, might, from a cowardice of
mind, PREFER it to the hardſhips and dangers
of OPPOSING it; but the ſame diſpoſition that
gave them ſuch a choice, unfitted them to act either
for or againſt. But England is rent into parties, with
equal ſhares of reſolution. The principle which
produced the war, divides the nation. Their ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities
are in the higheſt ſtate of fermentation, and
both ſides by a call of the militia are in arms. No
human foreſight can diſcern, no concluſion can be
formed, what turn a war might take, if once ſet on
by an invaſion. She is not now in a fit diſpoſition
to make a common cauſe of her own affairs, and
having no conqueſts to hope for abroad, and nothing
but expences ariſing at home, her every thing is
ſtaked upon a defenſive combat, and the further
ſhe goes, the worſe ſhe is off.</p>
            <p>There are ſituations a nation may be in, in which
peace or war, abſtracted from every other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may be politically right or wrong. When
nothing can be loſt by a war, but what muſt be loſt
without it, war is then the policy of that country;
and ſuch was the ſituation of America at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
of hoſtilities; But when no ſecurity can
be gained by a war, but what may be accompliſhed
by a peace, the cafe becomes reverſed, and ſuch now
is the ſituation of England.</p>
            <p>That America is beyond the reach of conqueſt,
is a fact which experience has ſhewn, and time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed;
and this admitted, what, I aſk, is now the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1058401600:220"/>
object of contention; If there be any honour in
purſuing ſelf-deſtruction with inflexible paſſion: if
national ſuicide be the perfection of national glory,
you may, with all the pride of criminal happineſs,
expire unenvied, and unrivalled.—But when the
tumult of war ſhall ceaſe, and the tempeſt of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
paſſions be ſucceeded by calm reflection, or
when thoſe, who ſurviving its fury, ſhall inherit
from you, a legacy of debts and misfortunes, when
the yearly revenue ſhall ſcarcely be able to diſcharge
the intereſt of the one, and no poſſible remedy be
left for the other: Ideas, far different to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
will ariſe, and embitter the remembrance of
former follies. A mind diſarmed of its rage, feels
no pleaſure in contemplating a frantic quarrel.
Sickneſs of thought, the ſure conſequence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
like yours, leaves no ability for enjoyment, no
reliſh for reſentment; and though, like a man in a
fit, you feel not the injury of the ſtruggle, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
between ſtrength and diſeaſe, the weakneſs,
will, nevertheleſs, be proportioned to the violence
and the ſenſe of pain, encreaſe with the recovery.</p>
            <p>To what perſons, or to whoſe ſyſtem of politics
you owe your preſent ſtate of wretchedneſs, is a
matter of total indifference to America. They
have contributed, however unwillingly, to ſet her
above themſelves; and ſhe, in the tranquillity of
conqueſt, reſigns the enquiry. The caſe now, is
not ſo properly, who began the war, as who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
it. That there are men in all countries to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1058401600:221"/>
whom a ſtate of war is a mine of wealth, is a fact ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be doubted. Characters like theſe, naturally
breed in the putrefaction of diſtempered times, and
after fattening on the diſeaſe, they periſh with it,
or impregnated with the ſtench, retreat into obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>But there are ſeveral erroneous notions, to
which you likewiſe owe a ſhare of your misfortunes,
and which, if continued, will only increaſe your
trouble and your loſſes. An opinion hangs about
the gentlemen of the minority, that America would
reliſh meaſures under THEIR adminiſtration,
which ſhe would not from the preſent cabinet.
On this rock lord Chatham would have ſplit had he
gained the helm, and ſeveral of his ſurvivors are
ſteering the ſame courſe. Such diſtinctions in the
infancy of the argument, had ſome degree of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
but they now ſerve no other purpoſe than
to lengthen out a war, in which the limits of the
diſpute, being fixt by the fate of arms, and guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
by treaties, are not to be changed, or altered
by trivial circumſtances.</p>
            <p>The miniſtry and many of the minority ſacrifice
their time in diſputing on a queſtion, with which,
they have nothing to do, namely, whether America
ſhall be independent or not? Whereas, the only
queſtion that can come under their determination,
is, whether they will accede to it or not? They
confound a military queſtion with a political one,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1058401600:222"/>
and undertake to ſupply by a vote, what they loſt
by a battle. Say, ſhe ſhall not be independent,
and it will ſignify as much, as if they voted againſt
a decree of fate, or ſay that ſhe ſhall, and ſhe will
be no more independent than before. Queſtions,
which when determined, cannot be executed, ſerve
only to ſhew the folly of diſpute, and the weakneſs
of the diſputants.</p>
            <p>From a long habit of calling America your own,
you ſuppoſe her governed by the ſame prejudices
and conceits which govern yourſelves. Becauſe
you have ſet up a particular denomination of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to the excluſion of all others, you imagine ſhe
muſt do the ſame; and, becauſe you, with an
unſociable narrowneſs of mind, have cheriſhed
againſt France and Spain, you ſuppoſe her alliance
muſt be defective in friendſhip. Copying her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the world from you, ſhe formerly thought
as you inſtructed, but now feeling herſelf free, and
the prejudice removed, ſhe thinks, and acts upon a
different ſyſtem. It frequently happens, that in
proportion as we are taught to diſlike perſons and
countries, not knowing why, we feel an ardour of
eſteem upon a removal of the miſtake: It ſeems
as if ſomething was to be made amends for, and
we eagerly give into every office of friendſhip, to
atone for the injury of the error.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:1058401600:223"/>
But, perhaps, there is ſomething in the extent
of countries, which, among the generality of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
inſenſibly communicates extenſion of the mind.
The ſoul of an iſlander in its native ſtate, ſeems
bounded by the foggy confines of the water's edge,
and all beyond, affords to him matters only for
profit or curioſity—not for friendſhip. His iſland
is to him, his world, and fixt to that, his every
thing centers in it; while thoſe, who are inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of a continent, by caſting their eye over a
larger field, take in likewiſe a larger intellectual
circuit, and thus approaching nearer to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the univerſe, their atmoſphere of
thought is extended, and their liberality fills a wider
ſpace. In ſhort, our minds ſeem to be meaſured
by countries when we are men, as they are by
places, when we are children, and until ſomething
happens to diſentangle us from the prejudice, we
ſerve under it without perceiving it.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, it may be remarked, that
men who ſtudy any univerſal ſcience, the principles
of which are univerſally known or admitted, and
applied without diſtinction to the common benefit
of all countries, obtain thereby a larger ſhare of
philanthropy than thoſe who only ſtudy national
arts and improvements. Natural philoſophy,
mathematics and aſtronomy, carry the mind from
the country to the creation, and give it a fitneſs
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1058401600:224"/>
ſuited to the extent. It was not Newton's honour,
neither could it be his pride, that he was an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman,
but that he was a philoſopher: The
Heavens had liberated him from the prejudices of
an iſland, and ſcience had expanded his ſoul as
boundleſs as his ſtudies.</p>

            <p>HAD America purſued her advantages with
half the ſpirit ſhe reſiſted her misfortunes, ſhe
would, before now, have been a conquering,
and a peaceful people; but lulled in the lap of
ſoft tranquillity, ſhe reſted on her hopes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
only has convulſed her into action. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſubtlety or ſincerity, at the cloſe of the laſt
year, induced the enemy to an appearance for
peace, is a point not material to know; it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
that we ſee the effects it has had on
our politics, and that we ſternly riſe to reſent the
deluſion.</p>
            <p>The war, on the part of America, has been a
war of natural feelings. Brave in diſtreſs; ſerene
in conqueſt; drowſy while at reſt; and in every
ſituation generouſly diſpoſed to peace. A danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
calm, and a moſt heightened zeal, have, as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
varied, ſucceeded each other. Every
paſſion, but that of deſpair, has been called to a
tour of duty; and ſo miſtaken has been the enemy,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1058401600:226"/>
of our abilities and diſpoſition, that when ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
us conquered, we roſe the conquerors. The
extenſiveneſs of the United States, and the variety
of their reſources; the univerſality of their cauſe,
the quick operation of their feelings, and the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of their ſentiments, have, in every trying ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
produced <hi>a ſomething,</hi> which favoured by
Providence, and purſued with ardour, has accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
in an inſtant the buſineſs of a campaign.
We have never deliberately ſought victory, but
ſnatched it; and bravely undone in an hour, the
plotted operations of a ſeaſon,</p>
            <p>The reported fate of Charleſtown, like the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of ſeventy-ſix, has at laſt called forth a
ſpirit, and kindled up a flame, which, perhaps, no
other event could have produced. If the enemy
has circulated a falſhood, they have unwiſely ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
us into life, and if they have told us a
truth, they have unintentionally done us a ſervice.
We were returning with folded arms from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
of war, and thinking and ſetting leiſurely
down to enjoy repoſe. The dependance that has
been put upon Charleſtown, threw a drowſineſs over
America. We looked on the buſineſs done—
The conflict over—the matter ſettled—or that all
which remained unfiniſhed would follow of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
In this ſtate of dangerous relax, expoſed to
the poiſonous inſuſions of the enemy, and having
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1058401600:227"/>
no common danger to attract our attention, we
were extinguiſhing by ſtages the ardour we began
with, and ſurrendering by piece meals the virtue
that defended us.</p>
            <p>Afflicting as the loſs of Charleſtown may be, yet
if it univerſally rouze us from the ſlumber of a
twelvemonths paſt, and renew in us the ſpirit of
former days, it will produce an advantage more
important than its loſs. America ever <hi>is</hi> what ſhe
<hi>thinks</hi> herſelf to be. Governed by ſentiment,
and acting her own mind, ſhe becomes, as ſhe
pleaſes, the victor or the victim.</p>
            <p>It is not the conqueſt of towns, nor the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
capture of garriſons, that can reduce a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
ſo extenſive as this. The ſufferings of one part
can ever be relieved by the exertions of another,
and there is no ſituation the enemy can be in, that
does not afford to us the ſame advantages ſhe ſeeks
herſelf. By dividing her force, ſhe leaves every
poſt attackable. It is a mode of war that carries
with it a confeſſion of weakneſs, and goes on the
principle of diſtreſs, rather than conqueſt.</p>
            <p>The decline of the enemy is viſible, not only in
their operations, but in their plans; Charleſtown
originally made but a ſecondary object in the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
of attack, and it is now become their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
one, becauſe they have not been able to ſucceed
elſewhere. It would have carried a cowardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1058401600:228"/>
in Europe, had they formed their grand
expedition in ſeventy-ſix, againſt a part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
where there was no army, or not a ſufficient
one to oppoſe them; but failing year after year in
their impreſſions here, and to the eaſtward and
northward, they deſerted their firſt capital deſign,
and prudently contenting themſelves with what
they can get, give a flouriſh of honour to conceal
diſgrace.</p>
            <p>But this piecemeal work is not conquering the
continent. It is a diſcredit in them to attempt it,
and in us to ſuffer it. It is now full time to put an
end to a war of aggravations, which, on one ſide,
has no poſſible object, and on the other, has every
inducement which honour, intereſt, ſafety and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
can inſpire. If we ſuffer them much longer
to remain among us, we ſhall become as bad as
themſelves. An aſſociation of vices will reduce us
more than the ſword. A nation hardened in the
practice of iniquity knows better how to profit by
it, than a young country newly corrupted. We
are not a match for them in the line of advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
guilt, nor they to us on the principles we bravely
ſet out with. Our firſt days were our days of honour.
They have marked the character of America
wherever the ſtory of her wars are told; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of this, we have nothing to do, but wiſely
and unitedly to tread the well known track.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:1058401600:229"/>
The progreſs of a war is often as ruinous to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals,
as the iſſue of it is to a nation; and it is
not only neceſſary that our forces be ſuch, that we
be conquerors in the end, but that by timely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions
we be ſecure in the interim. The preſent
campaign will afford an opportunity which has
never preſented itſelf before, and the preparations
for it are equally neceſſary, whether Charlſtown
ſtand or fall. Suppoſe the firſt, it is in that caſe
only a failure of the enemy, not a defeat. All the
conqueſt a beſieged town can hope for, is, not to be
conquered; and compelling an enemy to raiſe the
ſiege, is to the beſieged a victory. But there muſt
be a probability, amounting almoſt to certainty,
that would juſtify a garriſon marching out to attack
a retreat. Therefore, ſhould Charleſtown not be
taken, and the enemy abandon the ſiege, every
other part of the continent ſhould prepare to meet
them; and on the contrary, ſhould it be taken, the
ſame preparations are neceſſary to balance the loſs,
and put ourſelves in a condition to co-operate with
our allies, immediately on their arrival.</p>
            <p>We are not now fighting our battles alone, as
we were in ſeventy ſix. England, from a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
diſpoſition to America, has not only not declared
war againſt France and Spain, but the better to
proſecute her paſſions here, has afforded thoſe two
powers no military object, and avoids them, to
diſtreſs us. She will ſuffer her Weſt India iſlands
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:1058401600:230"/>
to be over-run by France, and her ſouthern ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
taken by Spain, rather than quit the object
that gratifies revenge. This conduct, on the part
of Britain, has pointed out the propriety of France
ſending a naval and land force to co - operate
with America on the ſpot. Their arrival cannot
be very diſtant, nor the ravages of the enemy long.
In the mean time the part neceſſary to us needs no
illuſtration. The recruiting the army, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſupplies, are the two things needful, and a
capture of either of the enemy's diviſions, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
to America peace and plenty.</p>
            <p>At a criſis, big, like the preſent, with expectation
and events, the whole country is called to unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and exertion. Not an ability ought now to
ſleep, that can produce but a mite to the general good,
nor even a whiſper to paſs that militates againſt it.
The neceſſity of the caſe, and the importance of
the conſequences, admit no delay from a friend,
no apology from an enemy. To ſpare now,
would be the height of extravagance, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
preſent eaſe, would be to ſacrifice it, perhaps,
for ever.</p>
            <p>America, rich in patriotiſm and produce, can want
neither men nor ſupplies, when a ſerious neceſſity
call them forth. The ſlow operation of taxes,
owing to the extenſiveneſs of collection, and their
depreciated value before they arrived in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,
have in many inſtances, thrown a burthen
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1058401600:231"/>
upon government, which has been artfully inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by the enemy into a general decline through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the country. Yet this, inconvenient as it may
at firſt appear, is not only remediable, but may be
turned to an immediate advantage; for it makes
no real difference, whether a certain number of
men, or company of militia (and in this country,
every man is a militia man) are directed by law to
ſend a recruit at their own expence, or whether a
tax is laid on them for that purpoſe, and the man
hired by government afterwards. The firſt, if
there is any difference, is both cheapeſt and beſt,
becauſe it ſaves the expence which would attend
collecting it as a tax, and brings the man ſooner into
the field, than the modes of recruiting formerly
uſed. And on this principle, a law has been paſſed
in this ſtate, for recruiting two men from each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of militia, which will add upwards of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
to the force of the country.</p>
            <p>But the flame, which has broke forth in this city
ſince the report from New York, of the loſs of
Charleſtown, not only does honour to the place,
but, like the blaze of ſeventy-ſix, will kindle into
action the ſcattered ſparks throughout America.—
The valour of a country, may be learned by the
bravery of its ſoldiery, and the general caſt of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
but confidence of ſucceſs is beſt diſcovered
by the active meaſures purſued by men of property;
and when the ſpirit of enterprize becomes ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1058401600:232"/>
as to act at once on all ranks of men, a war
may then, and not till then, be ſtiled truly popular.</p>
            <p>In ſeventy-ſix, the ardour of the enterpriſing
part was conſiderably checked, by the real revolt of
ſome, and the coolneſs of others. But in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
caſe, there is a firmneſs in the ſubſtance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of the country to the public cauſe. An aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
has been entered into by the merchants,
tradeſmen, and the principal inhabitants of this
city, to receive and ſupport the new ſtate money at
the value of gold and ſilver; a meaſure, which,
while it does them honour, will likewiſe contribute
to their intereſt, by rendering the operations of the
campaign convenient and effectual.</p>
            <p>Neither has the ſpirit of exertion ſtopt here. A
voluntary ſubſcription is likewiſe began, to raiſe a
fund of hard money to be given as bounties to fill
up the full quota of the Pennſylvania line. It has
been the remark of the enemy, that every thing
in America has been done by the force of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but when ſhe ſees individuals throwing in
their voluntary aids, and facilitating the public mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
in concert with the eſtabliſhed powers of the
country, it will convince her that the cauſe of
America ſtands not on the will of a few, but on the
broad foundation of property and popularity.</p>
            <p>Thus aided, and thus ſupported, diſaffection
will decline, and the withered head of tyranny ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1058401600:233"/>
in America. The ravages of the enemy will
be ſhort and limited, and like all their former ones,
will produce a victory over themſelves.</p>

CRISIS
EXTRAORDINARY.</head>
            <head type="sub">(On the Subject of Taxation.)</head>
            <p>IT is impoſſible to ſit down and think ſeriouſly on
the affairs of America, but the original principles
on which ſhe reſiſted, and the glow and ardour
they inſpired, will occur like the undefaced remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of a lovely ſcene. To trace over in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
the purity of the cauſe, the voluntary ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
made to ſupport it, and all the various turnings
of the war in its defence, is at once both paying and
receiving reſpect. The principles deſerve to be
remembered, and to remember them rightly, is
repoſſeſſing them. In this indulgence of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
recollection, we become gainers by what we
ſeem to give, and the more we beſtow the richer we
become.</p>
            <p>So extenſively right was the ground on which
America proceeded, that it not only took in every
juſt and liberal ſentiment which could impreſs the
heart, but made it the direct intereſt of every claſs
and order of men to defend the country. The war,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1058401600:235"/>
on the part of Britain, was originally a war of covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.
The ſordid, and not the ſplendid paſſions
gave it being. The fertile fields, and proſperous
infancy of America, appeared to her as mines for
tributary wealth. She viewed the hive, and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
the induſtry that had enriched it, thirſted for
the honey. But in the preſent ſtage of her affairs,
the violence of temper is added to the rage of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice;
and therefore, that, which at the firſt ſetting
out proceeded from purity of principle and public
intereſt, is now heightened by all the obligations of
neceſſity; for it requires but little knowledge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nature, to diſcern what would be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
were America again reduced to the ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Britain. Uncontrouled power, in the hands
of an incenſed, imperious, and rapacious conqueror,
is an engine of dreadful execution, and woe be to
that country over which it can be exerciſed. The
names of whig and tory would then be ſunk in the
general term of rebel, and the oppreſſion, whatever
it might be, would, with very few inſtances of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
light equally on all.</p>
            <p>Britain did not go to war with America for the
ſake of dominion, becauſe ſhe was then in poſſeſſion;
neither was it for the extenſion of trade and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
becauſe ſhe had monopolized the whole
and the country had yielded to it; neither was it to
extinguiſh what <hi>ſhe</hi> might call rebellion, becauſe,
before ſhe began, no reſiſtance exiſted. It could
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1058401600:236"/>
then be from no other motive than avarice, or a
deſign of eſtabliſhing, in the firſt inſtance, the ſame
taxes in America as are paid in England (which,
as I ſhall preſently ſhew, are above eleven times
heavier than the taxes we now pay for the preſent
year, 1780), or in the ſecond inſtance, to confiſcate
the whole property of America, in caſe of reſiſtance
and conqueſt of the latter, of which ſhe had then
no doubt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to ſhew what the taxes in
England are, and what the yearly expence of the
preſent war is to her,—What the taxes of this
country amount to, and what the annual expence of
defending it effectually will be to us; and ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
conciſely, to point out the cauſe of our
difficulties, and the advantages on one ſide, and the
conſequences on the other, in caſe we do, or do
not put ourſelves in an effectual ſtate of defence. I
mean to be open, candid and ſincere. I ſee a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
wiſh to expel the enemy from the country, a
murmuring becauſe the war is not carried on with
more vigour, and my intention is, to ſhew, as
ſhortly as poſſible, both the reaſon and the remedy.</p>

commence the war, how truly wretched and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
would the condition of this country be, were
ſhe, by her own remiſſneſs, to ſuffer an enemy of
ſuch a diſpoſition, and ſo circumſtanced, to reduce
her to ſubjection.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the revenues of America.</p>
            <p>I have already ſtated the number of ſouls in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
to be three millions, and by a calculation I have
made, which I have every reaſon to believe is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
right, the whole expence of the war and the
ſupport of the ſeveral governments, may be defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for two million pounds ſterling, annually; which,
on an average, is thirteen ſhillings and four pence
per head, men, women, and children, and the peace
eſtabliſhment at the end of the war, will be but three
quarters of a million, or five ſhillings ſterling per
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1058401600:240"/>
head. Now, throwing out of the queſtion every
thing of honour, principle, happineſs, freedom and
reputation in the world, and taking it up on the
ſimple ground of intereſt, I put the following caſe.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe Britain was to conquer America, and
as conquerors, was to lay her under no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
than to pay the ſame proportions towards
her annual revenue which the people of England,
pay; our ſhare in that caſe, would be ſix mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
pounds ſterling yearly; can it then be a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether it is beſt to raiſe two millions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the country and govern it ourſelves, and
only three quarters of a million afterwards, or pay
ſix millions to have it conquered, and let the enemy
govern it.</p>
            <p>Can it be ſuppoſed that conquerors would chuſe
to put themſelves in a worſe condition than what
they granted to the conquered. In England, the
tax on rum is five ſhillings and one penny ſterling
per gallon, which is one ſilver dollar and fourteen
coppers. Now would it not be laughable to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that after the expence they have been at, they
would let either whig or tory in America drink it
cheaper than themſelves. Coffee, which is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
an article of conſumption and ſupport here,
is there loaded with a duty, which makes the price
between five and ſix ſhillings ſterling a pound, and
a penalty of fifty pounds ſterling on any perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1058401600:241"/>
in roaſting it in his own houſe. There is
ſcarce an article of life you can eat, drink, wear,
or enjoy, that is not there loaded with a tax; even
the light from heaven is only permited to ſhine
into their dwellings by paying eighteen pence ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
per window annually; and the humbleſt drink
of life, ſmall beer, cannot there be purchaſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a tax of nearly two coppers a gallon, beſides a
heavy tax upon the malt, and another on the hops
before it is brewed, excluſive of a land tax on the
earth which produces them. In ſhort, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that country in point of taxation is ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive,
the number of her poor ſo great, and the
extravagance and rapaciouſneſs of the court ſo enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
that were they to effect a conqueſt of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
it is then only that the diſtreſſes of America
would begin. Neither would it ſignify any thing
to a man whether he be whig or tory. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of England, and the miniſtry of that country
know us by no ſuch diſtinctions. What they want
is clear ſolid revenue, and the modes they would
take to procure it, would operate alike on all.
Their manner of reaſoning would be ſhort, becauſe
they would naturally infer, that if we were able to
carry on a war of five or ſix years againſt them, we
were able to pay the ſame taxes which they do.</p>
            <p>I have already ſtated that the expence of conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the preſent war, and the government of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſtates, may be done for two millions ſterling,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1058401600:242"/>
and the eſtabliſhment in time of peace, for three
quarters of a million<note n="*" place="bottom">I have made the calculations in ſterling, becauſe it is a rate generally known in all the ſtates, and becauſe, likewiſe, it admits of an eaſy compariſon between our expences to ſupport the war, and thoſe of the enemy. Four ſilver dollars and an half is one pound ſterling, and three pence over.</note>.</p>
            <p>As to navy matters, they flouriſh ſo well, and
are ſo well attended in the hands of individuals,
that I think it conſiſtent on every principle of real
uſe and oeconomy, to turn the navy into hard mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
(keeping only three or four packets) and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to promote the ſervice of the army. We
ſhall not have a ſhip the leſs; the uſe of them, and
the benefit from them, will be greatly increaſed, and
their expence ſaved. We are now allied to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
naval power, from whom we derive the
aſſiſtance of a navy. And the line in which we
can proſecute the war, ſo as to reduce the common
enemy, and benefit the alliance moſt effectually,
will be, by attending cloſely to the land ſervice.</p>
            <p>I eſtimate the charge of keeping up, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
an army, officering them, and all expences
included, ſufficient for the defence of the country,
to be equal to the expence of forty thouſand men at
thirty pounds ſterling per head, which is one million
two hundred thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:1058401600:243"/>
I likewiſe allow four hundred thouſand pounds
for continental expences at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>And four hundred thouſand pounds for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the ſeveral ſtate governments, the amount
will then be,

            <p>I take the proportion of this ſtate, Pennſylvania,
to be an eighth part of the thirteen United States,
the quota then for us to raiſe will be two hundred
and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling; two hundred
thouſand of which, will be our ſhare for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and pay of the army and continental expences
at home and abroad, and fifty thouſand pounds for
the ſupport of ſtate government.</p>
            <p>In order to gain an idea of the proportion in
which the raiſing ſuch a ſum will fall, I make the
following calculation:</p>
            <p>Pennſylvania contains three hundred and ſeventy
five thouſand inhabitants, men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
which is likewiſe an eighth of the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the whole United States: therefore
two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling to
be raiſed among three hundred and ſeventy five
thouſand perſons, is, on an average, thirteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1058401600:244"/>
and four pence ſterling, per head, per annum,
or ſomething more than one ſhilling ſterling per
month. And our proportion of three quarters of
a million, for the government of the country, in
time of peace, will be ninety three thouſand ſeven
hundred and fifty pounds ſterling, fifty thouſand of
which will be for the government expences of the
ſtate, and forty three thouſand ſeven hundred and fifty
pounds for continental expences at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>The peace eſtabliſhment then, will, on an ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
be five ſhillings ſterling per head. Whereas,
was England now to ſtop, and the war to ceaſe, her
peace eſtabliſhment would continue the ſame as it
is now, viz. forty ſhillings per head; therefore, was
our taxes neceſſary for carrying on the war as much
per head, as her's now is, and the difference to be
only whether we ſhould, at the end of the war, pay
at the rate of five ſhillings per head, or forty
ſhillings per head, the caſe needs no thinking of.
But as we can ſecurely defend and keep the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
for one third leſs than what our burthen would
be if it was conquered, and ſupport the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
afterwards for one eighth of what Britain
would levy on us, and, could I find a miſer whoſe
heart never felt the emotion of a ſpark of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
even that man, uninfluenced by every love,
but the love of money, and capable of no attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but to his intereſt, would, and muſt, from the
frugality which governs him, contribute to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1058401600:245"/>
of the country, or he ceaſes to be a miſer, and
becomes an ideot. But when we take in with it,
every thing that can ornament mankind; when
the line of our intereſt becomes the line of
our happineſs; when all that can cheer and
animate the heart? when ſenſe of honour, fame,
character at home and abroad, are interwoven, not
only with the ſecurity, but the increaſe of property;
there exiſts not a man in America, unleſs he be a
hired emiſſary, who does not ſee that his good is
connected with keeping up a ſufficient defence.</p>
            <p>I do not imagine that an inſtance can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in the world, of a country putting herſelf to
ſuch an amazing charge to conquer and enſlave
another, as Britain has done. The ſum is too great
for her to think of with any tolerable degree of
temper; and when we conſider the burthen ſhe
ſuſtains, as well as the diſpoſition ſhe has ſhewn,
it would be the height of folly in us, to ſuppoſe
that ſhe would not reimburſe herſelf by the moſt
rapid means, had ſhe once more America within
her power. With ſuch an oppreſſion of expence,
what would an empty conqueſt be to her? what
relief under ſuch circumſtances could ſhe derive
from a victory without a prize! It was money, it
was revenue ſhe firſt went to war for, and nothing
but <hi>that</hi> would ſatisfy her. It is not the nature of
avarice to be ſatisfied with any thing elſe. Every
paſſion that acts upon mankind has a peculiar mode
of operation. Many of them are temporary and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1058401600:246"/>
fluctuating; they admit of ceſſation and variety.
But avarice is a fixed uniform paſſion. It neither
abates of its vigour, nor changes its object; and the
reaſon why it does not, is founded on the nature
of things, for wealth has not a rival, where avarice
is a ruling paſſion. One beauty may excel another,
and extinguiſh from the mind of a man the pictured
remembrance of a former one: But wealth is the
phoenix of avarice, and therefore cannot ſeek a new
object, becauſe there is not another in the world.</p>
            <p>I now paſs on to ſhew the value of the preſent
taxes, and compare them with the annual expence;
but this I ſhall preface with a few explanatory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</p>
            <p>There are two diſtinct things which make the
payment of taxes difficult; the one is the large and
real value of the ſum to be paid, and the other is,
the ſcarcity of the thing in which the payment is to
be made; and, although theſe appear to be one
and the ſame, they are in ſeveral inſtances, not
only different, but the difficulty ſprings from differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
cauſes.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a tax was to be laid, equal to one half
of what a man's yearly income is, ſuch a tax could
not be paid, becauſe the property could not be
ſpared; and on the other hand, ſuppoſe a very
trifling tax was laid to be collected in <hi>pearls,</hi> ſuch
a tax likewiſe could not be paid, becauſe it could
not be had. Now any perſon may ſee that theſe
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1058401600:247"/>
are diſtinct caſes, and the latter of them is a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of ours.</p>
            <p>That the difficulty cannot proceed from the
former, that is, from the real value or weight of
the tax is evident at firſt view, to any perſon who
will conſider it.</p>
            <p>The amount of the quota of taxes for this ſtate,
for the preſent year, 1780, (and ſo on in proportion
for every other ſtate) is twenty millions of dollars,
which at ſeventy for one, is but ſixty four thouſand
two hundred and eighty pounds three ſhillings ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and on an average, is no more than three ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and five pence ſterling, per head, per annum,
per man, woman, and child, or 3⅖ pence per head,
per month. Now here is a clear poſitive fact, that
cannot be contradicted, and which proves that the
difficulty cannot be in the weight of the tax, for in
itſelf it is a trifle, and far from being adequate to
our quota of the expence of the war. The quit-rents
of one penny ſterling per acre, on only one
half the ſtate, come to upwards of fifty thouſand
pounds, which is almoſt as much as all the taxes of
the preſent year, and as thoſe quit-rents made no
part of the taxes then paid, and are now diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
the quantity of money drawn for public ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
this year, excluſive of the militia fines, which
I ſhall take notice of in the proceſs of this work, is
leſs than what was paid, and payable in any year
preceding the revolution, and ſince the laſt war;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1058401600:248"/>
what I mean, is, that the quit-rents and taxes taken
together, came to a larger ſum then, than the
preſent taxes without the quit-rents do now.</p>
            <p>My intention by theſe arguments and calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
is, to place the difficulty to the right cauſe,
and ſhew that it does not proceed from the weight
or worth of the tax, but from the ſcarcity of the
medium in which it is paid: and to illuſtrate this
point ſtill farther, I ſhall now ſhew, that if the tax of
twenty millions of dollars, was of four times the real
value it now is, or nearly ſo, which would be about
two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling,
and would be our full quota, that this ſum would
have been raiſed with more eaſe, and leſs felt, than
the preſent ſum of only ſixty four thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and eighty pounds.</p>
            <p>The convenience or inconvenience of paying a
tax in money ariſes from the quantity of money that
can be ſpared out of trade.</p>
            <p>When the emiſſions ſtopt, the continent was
left in poſſeſſion of two hundred millions of dollars,
perhaps as equally diſperſed as it was poſſible for
trade to do it. And as no more was to be iſſued,
the riſe or fall of prices could neither increaſe nor
diminiſh the quantity. It therefore remained the
ſame through all the fluctuations of trade and
exchange.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:1058401600:249"/>
Now had the exchange ſtood at twenty for one,
which was the rate Congreſs calculated upon when
they quoted the ſtates the latter end of laſt year,
trade would have been carried on for nearly four
times leſs money than it is now, and conſequently
the twenty millions would have been ſpared with
much greater eaſe, and when collected would have
been of almoſt four times the value they now are.
And on the other hand, was the depreciation to be
ninety or one hundred for one, the quantity required
for trade would be more than at ſixty or ſeventy
for one, and though the value of them would be
leſs, the difficulty of ſparing the money out of
trade would be greater. And on theſe facts and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
I reſt the matter, to prove that it is not
the want of property, but the ſcarcity of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,
by which the proportion of property for tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is to be meaſured out, that makes the embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment
we lie under. There is not money
enough, and what is equally as true, the people
will not let there be money enough.</p>
            <p>While I am on the ſubject of the currency, I
ſhall offer one remark, which will appear true to
every body, and can be accounted for by nobody,
which is, that the better the times were, the worſe the
money grew; and the worſe the times were, the
better the money ſtood. It never depreciated by
any advantage obtained by the enemy. The trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1058401600:250"/>
of ſeventy-ſix, and the loſs of Philadelphia, in
ſeventy-ſeven, made no ſenſible impreſſion on
it, and every one knows, that the ſurrender of
Charleſtown did not produce the leaſt alteration in
the rate of exchange, which, for long before, and
for more than three months after, ſtood at ſixty for
one. It ſeems, as if the certainty of its being our
own, made us careleſs of its value, and that the moſt
diſtant thoughts of loſing it, made us hug it the
cloſer, like ſomething we were loth to part with;
or that we depreciate it for our paſtime, which,
when called to ſeriouſneſs by the enemy, we leave off
to renew again at our leiſure. In ſhort, our good
luck ſeems to break us, andour bad make us whole.</p>
            <p>Paſſing on from this digreſſion, I ſhall now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to bring into one view, the ſeveral parts I
have already ſtated, and form thereon ſome propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
and conclude.</p>
            <p>I have placed before the reader, the average tax
per head, paid by the people in England; which is
forty ſhillings ſterling.</p>
            <p>And I have ſhewn the rate on an average per
head, which will defray all the expence of the war
to us, and ſupport the ſeveral governments, without
running the country into debt, which is thirteen
ſhillings and four pence.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewn what the peace eſtabliſhment may
be conducted for, viz: an eighth part of what it
would be if under the government of Britain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:1058401600:251"/>
And I have likewiſe ſhewn what the average per
head of the preſent taxes are, namely, three ſhillings
and five pence ſterling, or 3⅖ per month; and that
their whole yearly value, in ſterling, is only ſixty
four thouſand two hundred and eighty pounds.
Whereas, our quota, to keep the payments equal
with the expences, is two hundred and fifty thouſand
pounds. Conſequently, there is a deficiency of one
hundred and eighty-five thouſand ſeven hundred and
twenty pounds, and the ſame proportion of defect,
according to the ſeveral quotas, happens in every
other ſtate. And this defect is the cauſe why the
army has been ſo indifferently fed, cloathed and
paid. It is the cauſe, likewiſe, of the nerveleſs
ſtate of the campaign, and the inſecurity of
the country. Now, if a tax equal to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
and four pence per head, will remove all
theſe difficuties, make people ſecure in their homes,
leave them to follow the buſineſs of their ſtores and
farms unmoleſted, and not only keep out, but drive
out the enemy from the country; and if the neglect
of raiſing this ſum will let them in, and produce the
evils which might be prevented—on which
ſide, I aſk, does the wiſdom, intereſt and policy lie;
Or, rather, would it not be an inſult to reaſon to
put the queſtion? The ſum, when proportioned out
according to the ſeveral abilities of the people, can
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1058401600:252"/>
hurt no one, but an inroad from the enemy ruins
hundreds of families.</p>
            <p>Look at the deſtruction done in this city. The
many houſes totally deſtroyed, and others damaged;
the waſte of fences in the country round it, beſides
the plunder of furniture, forage and proviſion. I
do not ſuppoſe that half a million ſterling would
reinſtate the ſufferers; and does this, I aſk, bear any
proportion to the expence that would make us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.
The damage, in an average, is at leaſt ten
pounds ſterling per head, which is as much as thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
ſhillings and four pence per head comes to for
fifteen years. The ſame has happened on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
and in the Jerſeys, New York, and other
places where the enemy has been—Carolina and
Georgia are likewiſe ſuffering the ſame fate.</p>
            <p>That the people generally do not underſtand the
inſufficiency of the taxes to carry on the war, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
not only from common obſervation, but
from the conſtruction of ſeveral petitions, which
were preſented to the aſſembly of this ſtate, againſt
the recommendation of Congreſs of the 18th of
March laſt, for taking up and funding the preſent
currency at forty for one, and iſſuing new money in
its ſtead. The prayer of the petition was, <hi>That the
currency might be appreciated by taxes</hi> (meaning the
preſent taxes) <hi>and that part of the taxes be applied
to the ſupport of the army, if the army could not be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1058401600:253"/>
otherwiſe ſupported.</hi> Now it could not have
been poſſible for ſuch a petition to have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
had the petitioners known, that ſo far from
<hi>part</hi> of the taxes being ſufficient for the ſupport of
the army, the <hi>whole</hi> of them falls three fourihs ſhort
of the year's expences.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to propoſe methods by which
a ſufficiency of money may be raiſed, I ſhall take a
ſhort view of the general ſtate of the country.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the weight of the war, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages
of the enemy, and the obſtructions ſhe has
thrown in the way of trade and commerce, ſo ſoon
does a young country outgrow misfortune, that
America has already ſurmounted many that once
heavily oppreſſed her. For the firſt year or two of
the war, we were ſhut up within our ports, ſcarce
venturing to look towards the ocean. Now our
rivers are beautified with large and valuable veſſels,
our ſtores filled with merchandize, and the produce
of the country has a ready market, and an advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
price. Gold and ſilver, that for a while
ſeemed to have retreated again within the bowels
of the earth, is once more riſen into circulation,
and every day adds new ſtrength to trade com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and agriculture. In a pamphlet written by
Sir John Dalrymple, and diſperſed in America in
the year 1775, he aſſerted, that, <hi>two twenty gun
ſhips, nay,</hi> ſays he, <hi>tenders of thoſe ſhips, ſtationed
between Albemarle ſound, and Cheſapeak bay would
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1058401600:254"/>
ſhut up the trade of America for</hi> 600 <hi>miles.</hi> How
little did Sir John Dalrymple know of the abilities
of America!</p>
            <p>While under the government of Britain, the
trade of this country was loaded with reſtrictions.
It was only a few foreign ports we were allowed to
ſail to. Now it is otherwiſe; and allowing that
the quantity of trade is but half what it was before
the war, the caſe muſt ſhew the vaſt advantage of
an open trade, becauſe the preſent quantity under
her reſtrictions, could not ſupport itſelf; from
which I infer, that if half the quantity without the
reſtrictions can bear itſelf up nearly, if not quite, as
well as the whole when ſubject to them, how proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
muſt the condition of America be when the
whole ſhall return open with all the world. By
trade, I do not mean the employment of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
only, but the whole intereſt and buſineſs of
the country taken collectively.</p>
            <p>It is not ſo much my intention, by this publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
to propoſe particular plans for raiſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
as it is to ſhew the neceſſity and the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to be derived from it. My principle deſign is
to form the diſpoſition of the people to ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
which I am fully perſuaded is their intereſt
and duty to adopt, and which needs no other force
to accompliſh them than the force of being felt.
But as every hint may be uſeful, I ſhall throw out
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1058401600:255"/>
a ſketch, and leave others to make ſuch improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon it as to them may appear reaſonable.</p>
            <p>The annual ſum wanted is two millions, and the
average rate in which it falls is thirteen ſhillings and
four pence per head.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe then, that we raiſe half the ſum, and
ſixty thouſand pounds over. The average rate
thereof, will be ſeven ſhillings per head.</p>
            <p>In this caſe, we ſhall have half the ſupply
we want, and an annual fund of ſixty thouſand
pounds, whereon to borrow the other million; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſixty thouſand pounds is the intereſt of a
million at ſix per cent. and if at the end of another
year, we ſhould be obliged by the continuance of
the war, to borrow another million, the taxes will be
increaſed to ſeven ſhillings and ſixpence, and thus
for every million borrowed, and an additional tax
equal to ſixpence per head muſt be levied.</p>
            <p>The ſum then to be raiſed next year, will be one
million and ſixty thouſand pounds; one half of
which I would propoſe ſhould be raiſed by duties
on imported goods and prize goods, and the other
half by a tax on landed property and houſes, or ſuch
other means as each ſtate may deviſe,</p>
            <p>But as the duties on imports and prize goods muſt
be the ſame in all the ſtates, therefore the rate per
cent, or what other form the duty ſhall be laid, muſt
be aſcertained and regulated by Congreſs, and
ingrafted in that form into the law of each ſtate;
and the monies ariſing therefrom carried into the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1058401600:256"/>
treaſury of each ſtate. The duties to be paid in
gold or ſilver.</p>
            <p>There are many reaſons why a duty on imports
is the moſt convenient duty or tax that can be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
one of which is, becauſe the whole is pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in a few places in a country, and it likewiſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
with the greateſt eaſe and equality, becauſe as
every one pays in proportion to what he conſumes,
ſo people, in general, conſume in proportion to
what they can afford, and therefore the tax is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by the abilities which every man ſuppoſes
himſelf to have, or in other words every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
his own aſſeſſor, and pays by a little at a time,
when it ſuits him to buy. Beſides, it is a tax
which people may pay or let alone, by not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the articles; and though the alternative may
have no influence on their conduct, the power of
chooſing is an agreeable thing to the mind. For
my own part, it would be a ſatisfaction to me, was
there a duty on all ſorts of liquors during the war,
as in my idea of things, it would be an addition to
the pleaſure of ſociety, to know, that when the
health of the army goes round, a few drops from
every glaſs become theirs. How often have I
heard an emphatical wiſh, almoſt accompanied with
a tear, "<hi>Oh, that our poor fellows in the field had
ſome of this!</hi>" Why then need we ſuffer under
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1058401600:257"/>
a fruitleſs ſympathy, when there is a way to enjoy
both the wiſh and the entertainment at once?</p>
            <p>But the great national policy of putting a duty
upon imports is, that it either keeps the foreign
trade in our own hands, or draws ſomething for the
defence of the country from every foreigner who
participates it with us.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the firſt half of the taxes, and as
each ſtate will beſt deviſe means to raiſe the other
half, I ſhall confine my remarks to the reſources of
this ſtate:</p>
            <p>The quota then of this ſtate, of one million and
and ſixty thouſand pounds, will be one hundred
and thirty three thouſand two hundred and fifty
pounds, the half of which, is ſixty ſix thouſand ſix
hundred and twenty five pounds; and ſuppoſing
one fourth part of Pennſylvania inhabited, then a
tax of one buſhel of wheat on every twenty acres
of land, one with another, would produce the ſum,
and all the preſent taxes to ceaſe. Whereas the
tythes of the biſhops and clergy in England, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
of the taxes, are upwards of half a buſhel of
wheat on <hi>every ſingle</hi> acre of land, good and bad,
throughout the nation.</p>
            <p>In the former part of this paper, I mentioned
the militia fines, but reſerved ſpeaking to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which I ſhall now do: The ground I ſhall
put it upon is, that two millions ſterling a year, will
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:1058401600:258"/>
ſupport a ſufficient army, and all the expences of
war and government, without having recourſe to
the inconvenient method of continually calling men
from their employments, which of all others is the
moſt expenſive and the leaſt ſubſtantial. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the revenues created by taxes as the firſt and
principal thing, and fines only as ſecondary and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
things. It was not the intention of the
militia law to apply the miltia fines to any thing elſe
but the ſupport of the militia, neither do they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any revenue to the ſtate, yet theſe fines amount
to more than all the taxes; for taking the muſter-roll
to be ſixty thouſand men, the fine on forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
who may not attend, will be ſixty thouſand
pounds ſterling, and thoſe who muſter, will give up
a portion of time equal to half that ſum, and if the
the eight claſſes ſhould be called within the year,
and one third turn out, the fine on the remaining
forty thouſand, would amount to ſeventy two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of dollars, beſides the fifteen ſhillings on every
hundred pounds property, and the charge of ſeven
and a half per cent for collecting, in certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
which on the whole, would be upwards of
two hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling.</p>
            <p>Now if thoſe very fines diſable the country
from raiſing a ſufficient revenue, without producing
an equivalent advantage, would it not be to the
caſe and intereſt of all parties, to encreaſe the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1058401600:259"/>
in the manner I have propoſed, or any better, if
a better can be deviſed, and ceaſe the operation of
the fines? I would ſtill keep the militia as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
body of men, and, ſhould there be a real
neceſſity to call them forth, pay them out of the
proper revenues of the ſtate, and encreaſe the taxes
a third or fourth per cent. on thoſe who do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.
My limits will not allow me to go farther
into this matter, which I ſhall therefore cloſe with
this remark, that fines are, of all modes of revenue,
the moſt unſuited to the mind of a free country.
When a man pays a tax, he knows the public ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
requires it, and therefore feels a pride in
diſcharging his duty; but a fine ſeems an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for neglect of duty, and of conſequence, is
paid with diſcredit, and frequently levied with
with ſeverity.</p>
            <p>I have now only one ſubject more to ſpeak to,
with which I ſhall conclude, which is, the reſolve
of Congreſs of the 18th of March laſt, for taking up
and funding the preſent currency at forty for one,
and iſſuing new money in its ſtead.</p>
            <p>Every one knows that I am not the flatterer of
Congreſs but in this inſtance <hi>they are right</hi>; and if
that meaſure is ſupported, the currency will acquire
a value, which, without it, it will not. But this is
not all: It will give relief to the finances until ſuch
time as they can be properly arranged, and ſave the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1058401600:260"/>
country from being immediately double taxed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the preſent mode. In ſhort, ſupport that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and it will ſupport you.</p>
            <p>I have now waded through a tedious courſe of
difficult buſineſs, and over an untrodden path. The
ſubject on every point it could be viewed, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
with perplexities, and enveloped in obſurity,
yet ſuch are the reſources of America, that ſhe
wants nothing but ſyſtem to inſure ſucceſs.</p>

               <head>On the preſent State of News.</head>
               <p>SINCE the arrival of two, if not three packets,
in quick ſucceſſion, at New York from England, a
variety of unconnected <hi>news</hi> has circulated through
the country, and afforded as great a variety of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</p>
               <p>That ſomething is the matter in the cabinet and
councils of our enemies, on the other ſide of the
water is certain—that they have run their length
of madneſs, and are under the neceſſity of changing
their meaſures may eaſily be ſeen into; but to what
this change of meaſure may amount, or how far
it may correſpond with our intereſt, happineſs and
duty, is yet uncertain; and from what we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1058401600:262"/>
experienced, we have too much reaſon to
ſuſpect them in every thing.</p>
               <p>I do not addreſs this publication ſo much to the
people of America as to the Britiſh miniſtry, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they may be, for if it is their intention to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
any kind of negociation, it is proper they
ſhould know before hand, that the United States
have as much honour as bravery; that they are no
more to be ſeduced from their alliance, than their
allegiance; that their line of politics is formed, and
not dependant, like that of their enemy, on chance,
and accident.</p>
               <p>On our part, in order to know, at any time,
what the Britiſh government will do, we have
only to find out what they ought <hi>not</hi> to do, and this
laſt will be their conduct. For ever changing, and
for ever wrong; too diſtant from America to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
circumſtances, and too unwiſe to foreſee
them; ſcheming without principle, and executing
without probability; their whole line of manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
has hitherto been blunder and baſeneſs.
Every campaign has added to their loſs, and every
year to their diſgrace; till unable to go on, and
aſhamed to go back, their politics have come to a
halt, and all their fine proſpects to the halter.</p>
               <p>Could our affections forgive, or humanity for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the wounds of an infant country—we might,
under the influence of a momentary oblivion, ſtand
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1058401600:263"/>
ſtill and laugh. But they are engraven where no
amuſement can conceal them, and of a kind for
which there is no recompence. Can ye reſtore
to us the beloved dead? Can ye ſay to the
grave, give up the murdered; Can ye obliterate
from our memories thoſe who are no more? Think
not then to tamper with our feelings by inſidious
contrivance, nor ſuffocate our humanity by ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
us to diſhonour.</p>
               <p>In March 1780, I publiſhed part of the Criſis,
No. IX, in the newſpapers, but did not conclude it
in the following papers, and the remainder has lain
by me till the preſent day.</p>
               <p>There appeared about that time ſome diſpoſition
in the Britiſh cabinet to ceaſe the further proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the war, and, as I had formed my opinion,
that whenever ſuch a deſign ſhould take place, it
would be accompanied with a diſhonourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to America, reſpecting France, I had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
the remainder of that number, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the baſeneſs of any ſuch propoſition. But
the arrival of the next news from England, declared
her determination to go on with the war, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
as the political object I had then in view
was not become a ſubject, it is unneceſſary in me
to bring it forward, which is the reaſon it was
never publiſhed.</p>
               <p>The matter which I allude to in the unpubliſhed
part, I ſhall now make a quotation of, and apply it
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1058401600:264"/>
as the more enlarged ſtate of things, at this day,
ſhall make convenient or neceſſary.</p>
               <p>It was as follows:</p>
               <p>"By the ſpeeches which have appeared from the
Britiſh Parliament, it is eaſy to perceive to what
impolitic and imprudent exceſſes their paſſions and
prejudices, have, in every inſtance, carried them
during the preſent war. Provoked at the upright
and honourable treaty between America and France,
they imagined nothing more was neceſſary to be
done to prevent its final ratification, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
through the agency of their commiſsioners,
(Carliſle, Eden, and Johnſton) a repeal of their
once offenſive acts of parliament. The vanity of
the conceit was as unpardonable, as the experiment
was impolitic. And ſo convinced am I, of their
wrong ideas of America, that I ſhall not wonder, if
in their laſt ſtage of political phrenzy, they propoſe
to her, to break her alliance with France, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into one with them. Such a propoſition, ſhould
it ever be made, and it has already been more than
once hinted in parliament, would diſcover ſuch a
diſpoſition to perfidiouſneſs, and ſuch diſregard of
honour and morals, as would add the finiſhing vice
to national corruption.—I do not mention this to
put America on the watch, but to put England on
her guard, that ſhe do not, in the looſeneſs of her
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1058401600:265"/>
heart, envelope in diſgrace, every fragment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation."—Thus far the quotation.</p>
               <p>By the complexion of ſome part of the news,
which has tranſpired through the New York pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
it ſeems probable that this inſidious aera in the
Britiſh politics, is beginning to make its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
I wiſh it may not; for that which is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to human nature, throws ſomething of a ſhade
over all the human character, and the individual
feels his ſhare of the wound, that is given to the
whole.</p>
               <p>The policy of Britain has ever been to divide
America in ſome way or other. In the beginning
of the diſpute, ſhe practiſed every art to prevent
or deſtroy the union of the ſtates, well knowing,
that could ſhe once get them to ſtand ſingly, ſhe
could conquer them unconditionally. Failing in
this project in America, ſhe renewed it in Europe;
and after the alliance had taken place, ſhe made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
offers to France to induce her to give up Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
and what is ſtill more extraordinary, ſhe at
the ſame time, made propoſitions to doctor Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
then in Paris, the very court to which ſhe was
ſecretly applying, to draw off America from France.
But this is not all.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of September, 1778, the Britiſh
court, through their ſecretary, lord Weymouth,
made application to the Marquis D'Almadovar the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1058401600:266"/>
Spaniſh Ambaſſador, at London, to "aſk the
MEDIATION," for theſe were the words of the
court of Spain, for the purpoſe of negociation a
peace with France, leaving America (as I ſhall
hereafter ſhew) out of the queſtion. Spain readily
offered her Mediation, and likewiſe the city of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid
as the place of conference, but withal, propoſed
that the united States of America ſhould be invited
to the treaty, and conſidered as independent during
the time the buſineſs was negociating. But this
was not the view of England. She wanted to draw
France from the war, that ſhe might uninterruptedly
pour out all her force and fury upon America: and
being diſappointed in this plan as well through the
open and generous conduct of Spain, as the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of France, ſhe refuſed the mediation ſhe
had ſolicited.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now give ſome extracts from the juſtifying
memorial of the Spaniſh court, in which ſhe has ſet
the conduct and character of Britain with reſpect
to America, in a clear and ſtriking point of
light.</p>
               <p>The memorial ſpeaking of the refuſal of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
court to meet in conference, with commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
from the United States, who were to be
conſidered as independent during the time of the
conference, ſays,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:1058401600:267"/>"It is a thing very extraordinary and even ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
that the court of London, who treats the
colonies as independent, not only in acting, but of
right, during the war, ſhould have a repugnance to
treat them as ſuch only in acting during a truce of
ſuſpenſion of hoſtilities. The convention of Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toga;
the reputing general Burgoyne as a lawful
priſoner, in order to ſuſpend his trial; the exchange
and liberating other priſoners made from the colonies;
they having named Commiſſioners to go and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Americans, at their own doors, requeſt
peace of them, and treat with them and the Congreſs,
and finally by a thouſand other acts of this ſort, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed
by the court of London, which have
been, and are true ſigns of the acknowledgement of
of their independence.</p>
               <p>"In aggravation to all the foregoing, at the ſame
time the Britiſh cabinet anſwered the king of Spain
in the terms already mentioned; they were inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themſelves at the court of France by means of
ſecret emiſſaries, and making very great offers to
her to abandon the colonies and make peace
with England. But there is yet more; for at this
ſame time the Engliſh miniſtry were treating by
means of another certain emiſſary, with doctor
Franklin, miniſter plenipotentiary from the colonies,
reſiding at Paris, to whom they made various pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1058401600:268"/>
to diſunite them from France, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
matters with England."</p>
               <p>"From what has been obſerved it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that the whole of the Britiſh politics was to
diſunite the two courts of Paris and Madrid, by
means of the ſuggeſtions and offers ſhe ſeparately
made to them; and alſo to ſeparate the colonies
from their treaties and engagements entered into
with France, and induce them to arm againſt the
houſe of Bourbon or MORE PROBABLY TO
OPPRESS THEM WHEN THEY FOUND
FROM BREAKING THEIR ENGAGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS,
THEY STOOD ALONE AND
WITHOUT PROTECTORS."</p>
               <p>"This therefore is the net they laid for the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican
ſtates; that is to ſay, to tempt them with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and very magnificent promiſes to come to
an accommodation with them, excluſive of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention
of Spain or France, that the Britiſh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
might always remain the arbiters of the fate
of the colonies.</p>
               <p>"But the Catholic king, (the king of Spain)
faithful on the one part to the engagements which
bind him to the moſt Chriſtian king (the king of
France) his nephew; juſt and upright on the other,
to his own ſubjects whom he ought to protect and
guard againſt ſo many inſults, and finally, full of
humanity and compaſſion for the Americans and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1058401600:269"/>
other individuals who ſuffer in the preſent war, he
is determined to purſue and proſecute it, and to
make all the efforts in his power, until he can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a ſolid and permanent peace, with full and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
ſecurities that it ſhall be obſerved."</p>
               <p>Thus far the memorial; a tranſlation of which
into Engliſh, may be ſeen in full, under the head of
STATE PAPERS, in the Annual Regiſter for
1779, page 367.</p>
               <p>The extracts I have here given, ſerve to ſhew
the various endeavours and contrivances of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to draw France from her connection with Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
and to prevail on her to make a ſeparate peace
with England, leaving America totally out of the
queſtion, and at the mercy of a mercileſs unprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
enemy. The opinion, likewiſe, which
Spain has formed of the Britiſh cabinet character,
for meanneſs and perfidiouſneſs, is ſo exactly the
opinion of America, reſpecting it, that the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
in this inſtance, contains our own ſentiments
and language; for people, however remote, who
think alike, will unavoidably ſpeak alike.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the inſidious uſe which Britain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to make of the propoſitions for peace,
under the mediation of Spain.—I ſhall now proceed
to the ſecond propoſition under the mediation of
the emperor of Germany and the empreſs of
Ruſſia; the general outline of which was, that a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1058401600:270"/>
congreſs of the ſeveral powers at war, ſhould meet
at Vienna, in 1781, to ſettle preliminaries of
peace.</p>
               <p>I could wiſh myſelf at liberty to make uſe of
all the information I am poſſeſſed of on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
but as there is a delicacy in the manner, I
do not conceive it prudent, at leaſt at preſent, to
make references and quotations in the ſame manner
as I have done with reſpect to the mediation of
Spain, who publiſhed the whole proceedings her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and, therefore, what comes from me on this
part of the buſineſs, muſt reſt on my own credit
with the public, aſſuring them, that when the
whole proceedings, relative to the propoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
at Vienna, ſhall appear, they ſhall find my
account not only true but ſtudiouſly moderate.</p>
               <p>We know that at the time this mediation was
on the carpet, the expectations of the Britiſh king
and miniſtry ran high with reſpect to the conqueſt
of America. The Engliſh packet which was
taken with the mail on board, and carried into
l'Orient, in France, contained letters from lord
G. Germaine to ſir Henry Clinton, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
in the fulleſt terms, the miniſterial idea of
a total conqueſt. Copies of thoſe letters were ſent
to Congreſs, and publiſhed in the newſpapers of
laſt year. Colonel Laurens brought over the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals,
ſome of which, ſigned in the hand writing
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1058401600:271"/>
of the then ſecretary Germaine, are now in my
poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Filled with theſe high ideas, nothing could be
more inſolent towards America than the language
of the Britiſh court on the propoſed meditation.
A peace with France and Spain ſhe anxiouſly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited;
but America, as before, ſhould be left to
her mercy; neither would ſhe hear any propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
for admitting an agent from the United
States into the congreſs of Vienna.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, France with an open, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and manly determination, and the fidelity of
a good ally, would hear no propoſition for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
peace, nor even meet in congreſs at Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,
without an agent from America: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that the independant character of the United
States, repreſented by the agent, ſhould be fully
and unequivocally defined and ſettled before any
conference ſhould be entered on. The reaſoning
of the court of France on the ſeveral propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the two Imperial courts, which relate
to us, is rather in the ſtyle of an American,
than an ally; and ſhe advocated the cauſe of
America, as if ſhe had been America herſelf.
Thus the ſecond mediation, like the firſt, proved
ineffectual.</p>
               <p>But ſince that time a reverſe of fortune has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the Britiſh arms, and all their high expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are daſhed to the ground. The noble exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1058401600:272"/>
to the ſouthward, under general Green; the
ſucceſsful operations of the allied armies in the
Cheſepeake; the loſs of moſt of their iſlands in the
Weſt-Indies, and Minorca in the Mediterranean;
the perſevering ſpirit of Spain againſt Gibraltar;
the expected capture of Jamaica; the failure of
making a ſeparate peace with Holland, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of one hundred millions ſterling, by which
all theſe fine loſſes were obtained, have read them
a loud leſſon of diſgraceful misfortune, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
has called on them to change their ground.
in this ſituation of confuſion and deſpair their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
councils have no fixed character. It is now the
hurricane months of Britiſh politics. Every day
ſeems to have a ſtorm of its own, and they are
ſcudding under the bare poles of hope. Beaten,
but not humble; condemned, but not penitent;
they act like men trembling at fate, and catching at
a ſtraw.—From this convulſion in the intrails of
their politics, it is more than probable that the
mountain groaning in labor, will bring forth a
mouſe as to its ſize, and a monſter in its make.
They will try on America the ſame inſidious arts
they tried on France and Spain.</p>
               <p>We ſometimes experience ſenſations to which
language is not equal. The conception is too bulky
to be born alive, and in the torture of thinking we
ſtand dumb. Our feelings, impriſoned by their
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:1058401600:273"/>
magnitude, find no way out—and, in the ſtruggle
of expreſſion every finger tries to be a tongue.
The machinery of the body ſeems too little for the
mind, and we look about for helps to ſhew our
thoughts by.—Such muſt be the ſenſation of
America, whenever Britain, teeming with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
ſhall propoſe to her to ſacrifice her
faith.</p>
               <p>But, excluſive of the wickedneſs, there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
offence contained in every ſuch attempt.
It is calling us villains; for no man aſks another to
act the villain unleſs he believes him inclined to
be one. No man attempts to ſeduce a truly honeſt
woman. It is the ſuppoſed looſeneſs of her mind
that ſtarts the thoughts of ſeduction, and he who
offers it calls her a proſtitute. Our pride is always
hurt by the ſame propoſitions, which offend our
principles; for when we are ſhocked at the
crime, we are wounded by the ſuſpicion of our
compliance.</p>
               <p>Could I convey a thought that might ſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
the public mind, I would not make the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the alliance the baſis of defending it. All
the world are moved by intereſt, and it affords
them nothing to boaſt of. But I would go a
ſtep higher, and defend it on the ground of
honour and principle. That our public affairs
have flouriſhed under the alliance—that it was
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1058401600:274"/>
wiſely made, and has been nobly executed—that
by its aſſiſtance we are enabled to preſerve our
country from conqueſt, and expel thoſe who ſought
our deſtruction—that it is our true intereſt to
maintain it unimpaired, and that while we do ſo
no enemy can conquer us;—are matters which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
has taught us, and the common good
of ourſelves, abſtracted from principles of faith
and honor, would lead us to maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection.</p>
               <p>But over and above the mere letter of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,
we have been nobly and generouſly
treated, and have had the ſame reſpect and attention
paid us, as if we had been an old eſtabliſhed
country. To oblige, and be obliged, is fair
work among mankind, and we want an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of ſhewing to the world that we are a
people ſenſible of kindneſs, and worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.
—Character is to us, in our preſent
circumſtances, of more importance than intereſt.
We are a young nation, juſt ſtepping upon the
ſtage of public life, and the eye of the world is
upon us to ſee how we act. We have an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that is watching to deſtroy our reputation,
and who will go any length to gain ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
againſt us, that may ſerve to render
our conduct ſuſpected, and our character odious;
becauſe, could ſhe accompliſh this, wicked as it
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1058401600:275"/>
is, the world would withdraw from us, as from
a people not to be truſted, and our taſk would
then become difficult.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſets the character of a nation in
a higher or lower light with others, than the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſulfilling, or perfidiouſly breaking of treaties.
They are things not to be tampered with; and ſhould
Britain, which ſeems very probable, propoſe
to ſeduce America into ſuch an act of baſeneſs, it
would merit from her ſome mark of unuſual deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
It is one of thoſe extraordinary inſtances in
which we ought not to be contented with the bare
negative of congreſs, becauſe it is an affront on the
multitude as well as on the government. It goes
on the ſuppoſition that the public are not honeſt
men, and that they may be managed by contrivance
though they cannot be conquered by arms. But,
let the world and Britain know, that we are neither
to be bought nor ſold. That our mind is great and
fixt, our proſpect clear, and that we will ſupport
our character as firmly as our independence.</p>
               <p>But I will go ſtill farther, general Conway, who
made the motion in the Britiſh parliament, for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuing
<hi>offenſive</hi> war in America, is a gentleman
of an amiable character. We have no perſonal
quarrel with him. But he feels not as we feel; he
is not in our ſituation, and that alone, with out any
other explanation, is enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:1058401600:276"/>
The Britiſh parliament ſuppoſes they have many
friends in America, and that when all chance of
conqueſt is over, they will be able to draw her
from her alliance with France. Now, if I have
any conception of the human heart, they will fail
in this, more than in any thing they have yet tried.</p>
               <p>This part of the buſineſs is not a queſtion of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
only but of honour and honeſty; and the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
will have in it ſomething ſo viſibly low and
baſe that their partizans, if they have any, will be
aſhamed of it. Men are often hurt by a mean ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
who are not ſtarted at a wicked one, and this
will be ſuch a confeſſion of their inability, ſuch a
declaration of ſervile thinking, that the ſcandal of it
will ruin all their hopes.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, we have nothing to do but to go on
with vigour and determination. The enemy is yet
in our country. They hold New-york, Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
and Savannah, and the very being in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
is an offence, and a part of offenſive war, and
until they can be driven from, or captured in them,
it would be folly in us to liſten to an idle tale. I
take it for granted that the Britiſh miniſtry are ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the impoſſibility of carrying on the war.
Let them come to a fair and open peace with France,
Spain, Holland and America in the manner ſhe
ought to do; but until then we can have nothing to
ſay to them.</p>

               <head>To Sir Guy Carlton.</head>
               <p>IT is the nature of compaſſion to aſſociate with
misfortune; and I addreſs this to you in behalf even
of an enemy, a captain in the Britiſh ſervice, now
on his way to the head quarters of the American
army, and unfortunately doomed to death for a
crime not his own.—A ſentence ſo extraordinary,
an execution ſo repugnant to every human ſenſation,
ought never to be told without the circumſtances
which produced it; and as the deſtined victim is yet
in exiſtence, and in your hands reſt his life or death,
I ſhall briefly ſtate the caſe and the melancholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
               <p>Captain Huddy of the Jerſey militia, was attacked
in a ſmall fort on Tom's river, by a party of refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gees
in the Britiſh pay and ſervice, was made priſoner
together with his company, carried to New-York
and lodged in the provoſt of that city: about three
weeks after which, he was taken out of the Provoſt
down to the water-ſide, put into a boat and brought
again upon the Jerſey ſhore, and there, contrary to
the practice of all nations but ſavages, was hung up
on a tree, and left hanging until found by our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who took him down and buried him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:1058401600:278"/>
The inhabitants of that part of the country where
the murder was committed, ſent a deputation to
General Waſhington with a full and certified ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the fact. Struck, as every human breaſt
muſt be, with ſuch brutiſh outrage, and determined
both to puniſh and prevent it for the future, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
repreſented the caſe to General Clinton, who
then commanded, and demanded that the refugee
officer, who ordered and attended the execution,
and whoſe name is Lippincut, ſhould be delivered
up as a murderer; and in caſe of refuſal, that the
perſon of ſome Britiſh officer ſhould ſuffer in his
ſtead. The demand, though not refuſed, has
not been complied with; and the melancholy lot,
(not by ſelection, but by caſting lots) has fallen
upon Captain Aſgill of the guards, who, as I have
already mentioned, is on his way from Lancaſter to
camp, a martyr to the general wickedneſs of the
cauſe he engaged in, and the ingratitude of thoſe he
has ſerved.</p>
               <p>The firſt reflection that ariſes on this black buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
is, what ſort of men muſt Engliſhmen be,
and what ſort of order and diſcipline do they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in their army, when, in the immediate place
of their head quarters, and under the eye and noſe
of their commander in chief, a priſoner can be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at pleaſure from his confinement, and his death
made a matter of ſport.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:1058401600:279"/>
The hiſtory of the moſt ſavage Indians does not
produce inſtances exactly of this kind. They, at
leaſt, have a formality in their puniſhments. With
them it is the horridneſs of revenge, but with your
army it is the ſtill greater crime, the horridneſs of
diverſion.</p>
               <p>The Britiſh generals who have ſucceeded each
other, from the time of General Gage to yourſelf,
have all affected to ſpeak in language they have no
right to. In their proclamations, their addreſſes,
their letters to General Waſhington, and their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
to Congreſs (for they deſerve no other
name), they talk of Britiſh honour, Britiſh genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and Britiſh clemency, as if thoſe things were
matters of fact; whereas, we, whoſe eyes are open,
who ſpeak the ſame language with yourſelves, many
of whom were born on the ſame ſpot with you,
and who can no more be miſtaken in your
words, than in your actions, can declare to all
the world, that ſo far as our knowledge goes,
there is not a more deteſtable character, nor a
meaner, or more barbarous enemy than the preſent
Britiſh one. With us, you have forfeited all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of reputation, and it is only holding you
like a wild beaſt, afraid of your keepers, that you
can be made manageable—But to return to the
point in queſtion:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:1058401600:280"/>
Though I can think no man innocent who has
lent his hand to deſtroy the country which he did
not plant, and to ruin thoſe he could not enſlave,
yet abſtracted from all ideas of right or wrong on
the original queſtion, Captain Aſgyli, in the preſent
caſe, is not the guilty man. The villain and the
victim are here ſeparated characters. You hold
the one and we the other. You diſown or affect
to diſown and reprobate the conduct of Lippencut,
yet you give him ſanctuary, and by ſo doing, you
as effectually become the executioner of Aſgill, as
if you put the rope round his neck, and diſmiſſed
him from the world. Whatever your feelings on
this extraordinary occaſion may be, are beſt known
to yourſelf. Within the grave of our own mind
lies buried the fate of Aſgill. He becomes the
corpſe of your will, or the ſurvivor of your juſtice.
Deliver up the one, and you ſave the other; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the one, and the other dies by your choice.</p>
               <p>On our part the caſe is exceeding plain; AN
OFFICER HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM
HIS CONFINEMENT AND MURDERED
AND THE MURDERER IS WITHIN
YOUR LINES. Your army have been guilty
of a thouſand inſtances of equal cruelty, but they
have been rendered equivocal, and ſheltered from
perſonal detection. Here the crime is fixt; and
is one of thoſe extraordinary caſes, which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1058401600:281"/>
be denied nor palliated, and to which the
cuſtom oſ war does not apply; for it never could
be ſuppoſed, that ſuch a brutal outrage would ever
be committed. It is an original in the hiſtory of
civilized barbarians, and is truly Britiſh.</p>
               <p>On your part, you are accountable to us for the
perſonal ſafety of the priſoners within your walls.
Here can be no miſtake: they can neither be ſpies
nor ſuſpected as ſuch; your ſecurity is not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered,
nor your operations ſubjected to miſcarriage,
by men immured within a dungeon. They differ
in every cirumſtance from men in the field, and
leave no pretence for ſeverity of puniſhment. But
if to the diſmal condition of captivity with you,
muſt be added the conſtant apprehenſions of death;
if to be impriſoned is ſo nearly to be entombed,
and, if after all, the murderers are to be protected,
and thereby the crime encouraged, wherein do you
differ from Indians, either in conduct or character.</p>
               <p>We can have no idea of your honour, or your
juſtice in any future tranſaction, of what nature it
may be, while you ſhelter within your lines an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous
murderer, and ſacrifice in his ſtead, an
officer of your own. If you have no regard to us
at leaſt ſpare the blood which it is your duty to
ſave. Whether the puiſhment will be greater on
him, whom in this caſe innocently dies, or on him
whom ſad neceſſity forces to retaliate, is, in the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1058401600:282"/>
nicety of ſenſation, an undecided Queſtion? It
reſts with you to prevent the ſufferings of both.
You have nothing to do but to give up the murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and the matter ends.</p>
               <p>But to protect him, be he who he may, is to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize
his crime, and to trifle it off by frivolous and
and unmeaning enquiries is to promote it. There
is no declaration you can make, no promiſe you can
give that will obtain credit. It is the man and not
the apology that is demanded.</p>
               <p>You ſee yourſelf preſſed on all ſides to ſpare the
life of your own officer, for die he will if you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
juſtice. The murder of captain Huddy is an
offence not to be borne with, and there is no ſecurity
we can have that ſuch actions, or ſimilar ones ſhall
not be repeated, but by making the puniſhment fall
upon yourſelves. To deſtroy the laſt ſecurity of
captivity, and to take the unarmed, the unreſiſting
priſoner to private and ſportive execution, is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
barbarity too high for ſilence. The evil muſt
be put an end to, and the choice of perſons reſts
with you. But if your attachment to the guilty is
ſtronger than to the innocent, you invent a crime
that muſt deſtroy your character, and if the cauſe
of your King needs to be ſupported, for ever ceaſe,
ſir, to torture our remembrance with the wretched
phraſes of Britiſh honour, Britiſh generoſity, and
Britiſh clemency.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:1058401600:283"/>
From this melancholy circumſtance, learn, ſir, a
leſſon of morality. The refugees are men whom
your predeceſſors have inſtructed in wickedneſs, the
better to fit them to their maſter's purpoſe. To
make them uſeful they have made them vile, and the
conſequence of their tortured villainy is now deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on the heads of their encouragers. They have
been trained like hounds to the ſcent of blood, and
cheriſhed in every ſpecies of diſſolute barbarity.
Their ideas of right and wrong are worn away in
the conſtant habitude of repeated infamy, till like
men practiſed in executions, they feel not the value
of another's life,</p>
               <p>The taſk before you though painful is not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult;
give up the murderer, and ſave your officer,
as the firſt outſet of a neceſſary reformation.</p>

            <p>In the preſent caſe—the mighty magnitude

we now ſtand on, and the vaſt proſpect
before us, muſt all conſpire to impreſs us with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
            <p>To ſee it in our power to make a world happy
—to teach mankind the art of being ſo—to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
on the theatre of the univerſe, a character hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
unknown—and to have, as it were, a new
creation entruſted to our hands, are honors that
command reflection, and can neither be too highly
eſtimated, nor too gratefully received.</p>
            <p>In this pauſe then of recollection—while the
ſtorm is ceaſing, and the long agitated mind vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
to a reſt, let us look back on the ſcenes we
have paſſed, and learn from experience what is yet
to be done.</p>
            <p>Never, I ſay, had a country ſo many openings to
happineſs as this. Her ſetting out into life, like
the riſing of a fair morning, was unclouded and
promiſing. Her cauſe was good. Her princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1058401600:286"/>
juſt and liberal. Her temper ſerene and firm.
Her conduct regulated by the niceſt ſteps, and
every thing about her wore the mark of honour.</p>
            <p>It is not every country (perhaps there is not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the world) that can boaſt ſo fair an origin.
Even the firſt ſettlement of America correſponds
with the character of the revolution. Rome, once
the proud miſtreſs of the univerſe, was originally
a band of ruffians. Plunder and rapine made her
rich, and her oppreſſion of millions made her great.
But America needs never be aſhamed to tell her
birth, nor relate the ſtages by which ſhe roſe to
empire.</p>
            <p>The remembrance then of what is paſt, if it
operates rightly, muſt inſpire her with the moſt
laudable of all ambition, that of adding to the
fair fame ſhe began with. The world has ſeen her
great in adverſity. Struggling without a thought
of yielding beneath accumulated difficulties.
Bravely, nay proudly, encountering diſtreſs, and
riſing in reſolution as the ſtorm encreaſed. All
this is juſtly due to her, for her fortitude has
merited the character. Let then the world ſee that
ſhe can bear proſperity: and that her honeſt virtue
in time of peace, is equal to the braveſt virtue in
time of war.</p>
            <p>She is now deſcending to the ſcenes of quiet and
domeſtic life. Not beneath the cypreſs ſhade of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1058401600:287"/>
diſappointment, but to enjoy in her own land,
and under her own vine, the ſweet of her labors,
and the reward of her toil. In this ſituation, may
ſhe never forget that a fair national reputation is
of as much importance as independence. That it
poſſeſſes a charm which wins upon the world, and
makes even enemies civil. That it gives a dignity
which is often ſuperior to power, and commands a
reverence where pomp and ſplendor fail.</p>
            <p>It would be a circumſtance ever to be lamented
and never to be forgotten, were a ſingle blot, from
any cauſe whatever, ſuffered to fall on a revolution,
which to the end of time muſt be an honor to the
age that accompliſhed it: and which has contributed
more to enlighten the world, and diffuſe a ſpirit of
freedom and liberality among mankind, than any
human event (if this may be called one) that ever
preceded it.</p>
            <p>It is not among the leaſt of the calamities of a
long continued war, that it unhinges the mind from
thoſe nice ſenſations which at other times appear ſo
amiable. The continual ſpectacle of woe, blunts
the finer feelings, and the neceſſity of bearing with
the ſight, renders it familiar. In like manner, are
many of the moral obligations of ſociety weakened,
till the cuſtom of acting by neceſſity, becomes an
apology, where it is truly a crime. Yet let but a
nation conceive rightly of its character, and it will
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:1058401600:288"/>
be chaſtly juſt in protecting it. None ever began
with a fairer than America, and none can be under
a greater obligation to preſerve it.</p>
            <p>The debt which America has contracted, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the cauſe ſhe has gained, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to flow from it, ought ſcarcely to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
She has it in her choice to do, and to live
as happily as ſhe pleaſes. The world is in her

                  <p>That the revolution began at the exact period of time beſt fitted to the purpoſe, is ſufficiently proved by the event—But the great hinge on which the whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine turned is the UNION OF THE STATES: and this union was naturally produced by the inability of any one ſtate to ſupport itſelf againſt any foreign enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Had the ſtates ſeverally been leſs able than they were when the war began, their united ſtrength would not have been equal to the undertaking, and they muſt, in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man probability have failed—And on the other hand, had they ſeverally been more able, they might not have ſeen, or what is more, might not have felt the neceſſity of uniting; and either by attempting to ſtand alone, or in ſmall confederacies, would have been ſeparately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</p>
                  <p>Now, as we cannot ſee a time (and many years muſt paſs away before it can arrive) when the ſtrength of any one ſtate, or ſeveral united, can be equal to the whole of the preſent United States, and as we have ſeen the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difficulty of collectively proſecuting the war to a ſucceſsful iſſue, and preſerving our national importance in the world, therefore, from the experience we have had, and the knowledge we have gained, we muſt, unleſs we make a waſte of wiſdom, be ſtrongly impreſſed with the advantage, as well as the neceſſity of ſtrengthening that happy union which has been our ſalvation, and without which, we ſhould have been a ruined people.</p>
                  <p>While I was writing this note, I caſt my eye on the pamphlet COMMON SENSE, from which I ſhall make an extract, as it applies exactly to the caſe. It is as follows:</p>
                  <p>"I have never met with a man, either in England or America, who hath not confeſſed his opinion that a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between the countries would take place one time or other: And there is no inſtance in which we have ſhewn leſs judgment, than in endeavouring to deſcribe, what we call, the ripeneſs or fitneſs of the continent for independence.</p>
                  <p>"As all men allow the meaſure, and differ only in their opinion of the time, let us, in order to remove miſtakes, take a general ſurvey of things, and endeavour, if poſſible, to find out the VERY TIME. But we need not go far, the enquiry ceaſes at once, for, THE TIME HATH FOUND US. The general concurrence, the glorious union of all things prove the fact.</p>
                  <p>"It is not in numbers, but in a union, that our great ſtrength lies. The continent is juſt arrived at that pitch of ſtrength, in which no ſingle colony is able to ſupport itſelf, and the whole when united, can accompliſh the matter; and either more or leſs than this, might be fatal in its effects."</p>
               </note>. And
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1058401600:289"/>
inſtead of a domineering maſter, ſhe has gained an
<hi>ally,</hi> whoſe exemplary greatneſs, and univerſal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality,
have extorted a confeſſion even from her
enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:1058401600:290"/>
With the bleſſings of peace, independence, and
an univerſal commerce, the ſtates individually, and
collectively, will have leiſure and opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
and eſtabliſh their domeſtic concerns, and
to put it beyond the power of calumny to throw
the leaſt reflection on their honor. Character is
much eaſier kept than recovered, and that man, if
any ſuch there be, who, from any ſiniſter views, or
littleneſs of ſoul, lends unſeen his hand to injure it,
contrives a wound it will never be in his power to
heal.</p>
            <p>As we have eſtabliſhed an inheritance for poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
let that inheritance deſcend, with every mark
of an honourable conveyance. The little it will
coſt, compared with the worth of the ſtates, the
greatneſs of the object, and the value of national
character, will be a profitable exchange.</p>
            <p>But that which muſt more forcibly ſtrike a
thoughtful penetrating mind, and which includes
and renders eaſy all inferior concerns, is the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1058401600:291"/>
UNION OF THE STATES. On this, our great
national character depends. It is this which muſt
give<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us importance abroad and ſecurity at home.
It is through this only that we are, or can be
nationally known in the world. It is the flag
of the United States which renders our ſhips
and commerce ſafe on the ſeas, or in a foreign
port. Our Mediterranean paſſes muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
under the ſame ſtile. All our treaties,
whether of alliance, peace or commerce, are
formed under the ſovereignty of the United
States, and Europe knows us by no other name
or title.</p>
            <p>The diviſion of the empire into ſtates is for
our own convenience, but abroad this diſtinction
ceaſes. The affairs of each ſtate are local.
They can go no farther than to itſelf. And
were the whole worth of even the richeſt of
them expended in revenue, it would not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to ſupport ſovereignty againſt a foreign
attack. In ſhort, we have no other national ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
than as United States. It would even
be fatal for us if we had—too expenſive to be
maintained, and impoſſible to be ſupported. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals
or individual ſtates may call themſelves
what they pleaſe; but the world, and eſpecially
the world of enemies, is not to be held in awe by
the whiſtling of a name. Sovereignty muſt have
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:1058401600:292"/>
power to protect all the parts that compoſe and
conſtitute it: and as UNITED STATES we are
equal to the importance of the title, but otherwiſe
we are not. Our union well and wiſely regulated
and cemented, is the cheapeſt way of being great,
the eaſieſt way of being powerful, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt
invention in government, which the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of America can admit of—Becauſe it
collects from each ſtate, that, which, by being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate,
can be of no uſe to it, and forms an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate
that ſerves for all.</p>
            <p>The ſtates of Holland are an unfortunate inſtance
of the effects of individual ſovereignty. Their
disjointed condition expoſes them to numerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
loſſes, calamities and enemies; and the
almoſt impoſſibility of bringing their meaſures to a
deciſion, and that deciſion into execution, is to
them, and would be to us, a ſource of endleſs mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
            <p>It is with confederated ſtates, as with individuals
in ſociety; ſomething muſt be yielded up to make
the whole ſecure. In this view of things, we gain
by what we give, and draw an annual intereſt
greater than the capital.—I ever feel myſelf
hurt when I hear the union, that great palladium of
our liberty and ſafety, the leaſt irreverently ſpoken
of. It is the moſt ſacred thing in the conſtitution
of America, and that, which every man ſhould be
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:1058401600:293"/>
moſt proud and tender of. Our citizenſhip in the
United ſtates is our national character. Our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenſhip
in any particular ſtate, is only our local diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction.
By the latter, we are known at home, by
the former to the world. Our great title is,
AMERICANS—our inferior one varies with the
place.</p>
            <p>So far as my endeavours could go, they have all
been directed to conciliate the affections, unite the
intereſts, and draw and keep the mind of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
together; and the better to aſſiſt in this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
work of the revolution, I have avoided all
places of profit or office, either in the ſtate I live
in, or in the United States; kept myſelf at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from all parties and party connections, and
even diſregarded all private and inferior concerns:
and when we take into view the great work we have
gone through, and feel as we ought to feel, the juſt
importance of it, we ſhall then ſee, that the little
wranglings, and indecent contentions of perſonal
party, are as diſhonourable to our characters, as
they are injurious to our repoſe.</p>
            <p>It was the cauſe of America that made me an
author. The force with which it ſtruck my
mind, and the dangerous condition of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
appeared to me in, by courting an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and unnatural reconciliation with thoſe who
were determined to reduce her, inſtead of ſtriking
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:1058401600:294"/>
out into the only line that could cement and
ſave her, A DECLARATION OF INDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENDENCE,
made it impoſſible for me, feeling
as I did, to be ſilent: and if, in the courſe of
more than ſeven years, I have rendered her any
ſervice, I have likewiſe added ſomething to the
reputation of literature, by freely and diſintereſtedly
employing it in the great cauſe of mankind,
and ſhewing there may be genius without proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution.</p>
            <p>Independence always appeared to me practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
and probable; provided the ſentiment of
the country could be formed, and held to the
object; and there is no inſtance in the world,
where a people ſo extended, and wedded to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
habits of thinking, and under ſuch a variety
of circumſtances, were ſo inſtantly and ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
pervaded, by a turn in politics, as in the
caſe of independence, and who ſupported their
opinon, undiminiſhed, through ſuch a ſucceſſion
of good and ill-fortune, till they crowned it with
ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>But as the ſcenes of war are cloſed, and every
man preparing for home and happier times, I
therefore take my leave of the ſubject. I have
moſt ſincerely followed it from beginning to end,
and through all its turns and windings: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:1058401600:295"/>
country I may hereafter be in, I ſhall always
feel an honeſt pride at the part I have taken and
acted, and a gratitude to Nature and Providence
for putting it in my power to be of ſome uſe to
mankind.</p>
