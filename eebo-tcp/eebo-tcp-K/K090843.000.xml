            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THIS work is compoſed from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of perhaps half my life, made without the leſt original view of publication, from the numberleſs walks taken in and about our capital, with a mind occupied with more ideas than the frivolous viſit, or the mere object of the hour.</p>
            <p>SOME were made in company of different friends, ſtricken, like myſelf, with the love of the ſcience of antiquities; and with the deſire of tracing the progreſs of perhaps the firſt city (comparing all its advantages) in the univerſe.</p>
            <p>THE remarks made in theſe latter walks
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0170100100:4"/>
were committed to my tablets till they became rather conſiderable. In that ſtate I determined to lay them before the public, not urged by <hi>deſire</hi> of friends, nor the <hi>wiſh</hi> of the people, or any ſimilar motives, but by my own continued propenſity to writing.</p>
            <p>I HAVE two things to apologize for in this performance. Firſt, its irregularity: but I do aſſure my friends it is given nearly in the ſame manner in which the materials were collected, and quite according to the courſe of the walk of the day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let me requeſt the good inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> not to be offended at my having ſtuffed their <hi>Iliad</hi> into a nut-ſhell: the account of the city of <hi>London,</hi> and liberties of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> into a <hi>quarto</hi> volume. I have condenſed into it all I could; omitted nothing that ſuggeſted itſelf, nor am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0170100100:5"/>
any thing <hi>to make it a guinea book.</hi> In a word, it is done in my own manner, from which I am grown too old to depart.</p>
            <p>I FEEL within myſelf a certain monitor that warns me to hang up my pen in time, before its powers are weakened, and rendered viſibly impaired. I wait not for the admonition of friends. I have the archbiſhop of <hi>Grenada</hi> in my eye: and fear the imbecility of human nature might produce, in long-worn age, the ſame treatment of my kind adviſers, as poor <hi>Gil Blas</hi> had from his moſt reverend patron. My literary bequeſts to future times, and more ſerious concerns, muſt occupy the remnant of my days. This cloſes my public labors.</p>
            <p>To every particular friend and correſpondent I ſend my moſt cordial thanks, for their candid and unremitted attention to my various enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: and for their bearing ſo long with my
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0170100100:6"/>
yearning after information; and with my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common curioſity, without which no writer can proceed with the confidence of accuracy, or ought to lay any thing before the public unſanctioned by local information. So much for acknowlegement of private favors.—I take leave of a partial public, with the trueſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for its long endurance of my very volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous writings: for its kind foſtering my few merits: for its affected blindneſs to my nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous defects. The laſt act concluded!</p>

They cleared the land in the neighborhood of their dwellings, they ſowed corn, they reaped and depoſited it in granaries under ground, as the <hi>Sicilians</hi> practiſe to this very day; but the latter lodged it in the grain, our predeceſſors in the ear, out of which they picked the grains as they wanted them, and, ignorant of mills, at firſt bruiſed, and then made them into a coarſe bread<note n="†" place="bottom">Conjuges et liberos in loca tuta transferrent. <hi>Tacitus in vit.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0170100100:11"/>
layed the foundation of commerce, which in early times extended no farther than to our maritime places. <hi>They</hi> firſt received the rudiments of civilization, while the more remote remained, in proportion to their diſtance, more and more ſavage, or in a ſtate of nature. In the ſame degree as the neighboring <hi>Gauls</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came acquainted with the arts, they communicated them to the neareſt <hi>Britiſh</hi> coloniſts; who, derived from the ſame ſtock, and retaining the ſame language and manners, were more capable and willing to receive any inſtructions offered by a congenerous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

            <p>THERE is not the leſt reaſon to doubt but that <hi>London</hi> exiſted at that period, and was a place of much reſort.<note place="margin">LONDON.</note> It ſtood in ſuch a ſituation as the <hi>Britons</hi> would ſelect, according to the rule they eſtabliſhed.

It was even then of ſuch concourſe, and ſuch vaſt trade, that the wiſe conquerors did not think fit to truſt the inhabitants with the ſame privileges as other places, of which they had leſs reaſon to be jealous.</p>
            <p>THERE is no mention of this important place, till the reign of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> when <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaks of it as not having been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed as a colony, but famous for its great concourſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and its vaſt commerce: this indicates, at leſt, that <hi>London</hi> had been at that time of ſome antiquity as a trading town. The exports from hence were cattle, hides, and corn; dogs made a ſmall article; and, let me add, that ſlaves were a conſiderable object.

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0170100100:18"/>
was found a vaſt coemetery: firſt lay the <hi>Saxons,</hi> in graves lined with chalk-ſtones, or in coffins of hollowed ſtones; beneath them had been the bodies of the <hi>Britons,</hi> placed in rows. Abundance of ivory and boxen pins, about ſix inches long, marked their place. Theſe were ſuppoſed to have faſtened the ſhrouds in which the bodies were wrapped<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Parentalia,</hi> p. 266.</note>. Theſe periſhing, left the pins entire. In the ſame row, but deeper, were <hi>Roman</hi> urns intermixed, lamps, lacrymatories; fragments of ſacrificial veſſels were alſo diſcovered, in digging towards the north-eaſt corner; and in 1675, not far from the eaſt corner, at a conſiderable depth, beneath ſome flinty pavement, were found numbers of veſſels of earthen ware, and of glaſs, of moſt exquiſite colors and beauty, ſome inſcribed with the names of deities, heroes, or men of rank. Others ornamented with variety of figures in bas relief, of animals and of roſe-trees. <hi>Teſulae</hi> of jaſper, porphyry, or marble, ſuch as form the pavement we ſo often ſee, were alſo diſcovered. Alſo glaſs beads and rings, large pins of ivory and bone, tuſks of boars, and horns of deer ſawn through. Alſo coins of different emperors, among them ſome of <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> which at once deſtroys the conjecture of Mr. <hi>Maitland,</hi> who ſuppoſes that this collection were flung together at the ſacking of <hi>London</hi> by our injured <hi>Boadicia.</hi>

It is probable that the biſhop of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, and the <hi>Portgrave,</hi> were united in the government, for in the <hi>Saxon</hi> charters they are mentioned together: in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, <hi>Alſwar</hi> the biſhop, and <hi>Wolfgar</hi> my <hi>Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave.

            <p>LONDON certainly could not have been in the very low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which ſome writers repreſent it to have been, at the time of the Conqueſt. It had ventured to ſally out on the Conqueror, but without ſucceſs. It fell more by internal faction, than its own weakneſs; yet there was ſtrength enough left, to make <hi>William</hi> think proper to ſecure their allegiance, by building that ſtrong fortreſs the <hi>Tower.</hi> In ſeventy years from that event, an hiſtorian <note n="†" place="bottom">Fitzſtephen.</note> of that period pretends, that <hi>London</hi> muſtered ſixty thouſand foot, and twenty thouſand horſe. If this is any thing near the truth, is it poſſible but <hi>London</hi> muſt have been very powerful at the time of the Conqueſt? for the reigns between that period and of <hi>Stephen,</hi> were not well calculated for a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of population. I rather concur with them who think that the muſter muſt have been of the militia of the neighboring counties, and <hi>London</hi> the place of rendezvous. A writer <note n="‡" place="bottom">

more appearance of truth, makes the number of inhabitants only forty thouſand.</p>
            <p>DURING the time of the Conqueror, and till the reign of <hi>Richard</hi> I. the name of the civil governor continued the ſame. That monarch, to ſupport the madneſs of the <hi>cruſade,</hi> received from the citizens a large ſum of money; and in return, permitted them to chuſe annually two officers, under the name of bailiffs, or ſheriffs; who were to ſuperſede the former. The names of the two firſt upon record are <hi>Wolgarius,</hi> and <hi>Geffry de Magnum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the next reign was added the office of mayor,<note place="margin">CHANGED TO A MAYOR.</note> a title bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the <hi>Norman Maire,</hi> as well as the office. <hi>Henry Fitz-alwyn</hi> was the firſt elected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o that truſt. He had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mayor, but only by the nomination of his prince.</p>
            <p>IN the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> III. after the citizens had ſuffered many oppreſſions, he reſtored a form of government, and appointed twenty-four citizens to ſhare the power. In his ſon's reign, we find the city divided into twenty-four wards; the ſupreme ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of which was named <hi>Alderman,</hi>

purſuit of my plan, I wiſh to give a ſlight view of the ſhores I am about to launch from: the account muſt be brief and confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, limited to what I ſhall ſay of their antient ſtate, to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod bounded by the REVOLUTION; intermixed with the greater events, which have happened in nearer days.</p>
            <p>THE choice of the ſituation of this great city was moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. It is on a gravelly ſoil; and on a declivity down to the borders of a magnificent river. The ſlope is evident in every part of the antient city, and the vaſt modern buildings. The antient city was defended in front by the river; on the weſt ſide by the deep ravine, ſince known by the name of <hi>Fleet-ditch;</hi> on the north by moraſſes; on the eaſt, as I ſuſpect, by another ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. All the land round <hi>Weſtminſter Abbey</hi> was a flat ſen, which continued beyond <hi>Fulham:</hi> but a riſe commences oppoſite to it, and forms a magnificent bend above the curvature of the <hi>Thames,</hi> even to the <hi>Tower.</hi> The <hi>Surry</hi> ſide was in all probability a great expanſe of water, a lake, a <hi>Llyn,</hi> as the <hi>Welſh</hi> call it; which an ingenious countryman of mine<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>William Owen,</hi> of <hi>Barmouth,</hi> now reſident in <hi>London.</hi>
               </note>, not without reaſon, thinks might have given a name to our capital; <hi>Llyn Din,</hi> or the city on the lake. This moſt probably was the original name: and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>Llong</hi> a ſhip, and <hi>Din</hi> a town, might have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed when the place became a ſeat of trade, and famous for the concourſe of ſhipping. The expanſe of water might have filled the ſpace between the riſing grounds at <hi>Deptfor</hi> and thoſe at <hi>Clapham;</hi> and been bounded to the ſouth by the beautiful <hi>Surry Hills. Lambeth Marſh,</hi> and the <hi>Bank Side,</hi> evidently were reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the water. Along <hi>Lambeth</hi> are the names of <hi>Narrow
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0170100100:29"/>
Walls,</hi> or the mounds which ſerved for that purpoſe; and in <hi>South-wark, Bankſide</hi> again ſhews the means of converting the antient lake into uſeful land: even to this day the tract beyond <hi>South-wark,</hi> and in particular that beyond <hi>Bermondſey ſtreet,</hi> is ſo very low, and beneath the level of common tides, that the proprietors are obliged to ſecure it by embankments.</p>
            <p>I BEGIN my account by croſſing over the <hi>Thames</hi> into <hi>Surry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">SURRY.</note> which, with <hi>Suſſex,</hi> formed the country of the antient <hi>Regni,</hi> being part of this iſland to which the <hi>Romans</hi> permitted a kingly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, merely to enjoy the inſolent boaſt of having kings as their ſlaves. The <hi>Saxons</hi> beſtowed on this part their own names of <hi>Suthry</hi> or <hi>Suthrea,</hi> from its ſituation on the ſouthern part of the river. I proceed to my accuſtomed walk of LAMBETH.<note place="margin">LAMBETH.</note> In the earlier times it was a manor, poſſibly a royal one, for the great <hi>Hardiknut</hi> died here in 1042, in the midſt of the jollity of a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dinner: and here, without any formality, the uſurper <hi>Harold</hi> is ſaid to have ſnatched the crown, and placed it on his own head. At that period it was part of the eſtate of <hi>Goda,</hi> wife to <hi>Walter</hi> earl of <hi>Mantes,</hi> and <hi>Euſtace</hi> earl of <hi>Boulogne;</hi> who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the church of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> but reſerved to herſelf the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of the church. It became, in 1197, the property of the ſee of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by exchange tranſacted between <hi>Glanville</hi> biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and the archbiſhop <hi>Hubert Walter.

               <note place="margin">A COLLEGE OF SECULAR MONKS PROJECTED HERE</note> to have erected here a college of ſecular monks, independent of thoſe of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> It was originally deſigned, by archbiſhop <hi>Baldwyn,</hi> to have been built at <hi>Hackington,</hi> near that city: but ſuch a jealouſy did thoſe holy men conceive at the thought of a rival houſe ſo near to their own, that by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with the pope the project was layed aſide. It was afterwards reſumed by <hi>Hubert Walter,</hi> who thought he could give no offence by erecting the college on this diſtant manor; but the monks ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a bull from the pope in their favor, and ſuch humiliating terms preſcribed to the archbiſhop, that from thenceforth he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſiſted from the deſign <note n="†" place="bottom">8, 9.</note>. The mortifications which the primates met with in the proſecution, ſeem to have firſt determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in fixing their reſidence here. <hi>Walter</hi> and <hi>Langton</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively lived at the manor-houſe of <hi>Lambeth.</hi> The laſt improved it, but the building was afterwards neglected and became ruinous. No pious zeal reſtored the place, but the madneſs of prieſtly pride. <hi>Boniface,</hi> a wrathful and turbulent primate, elected in 1244, took it into his head to become a viſitor of the priory of <hi>St. Bartholomew,</hi> to which he had no right. The monks met him with reverential reſpect, but aſſured him the office did not belong to the biſhop. The meek prelate ruſhed on the ſub-prior, knocked him down,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0170100100:31"/>
kicked, beat, and buffeted him, tore the cope off his back, and ſtamped on it like one poſſeſſed, while his attendants payed the ſame compliments to all the poor monks. The people, enraged at his unprieſtly conduct, would have torn him to pieces; when he retired to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and, by way of expiation, rebuilt it with great magnificence.</p>
            <p>THIS palace was very highly improved by the munificent <hi>Henry Chichely,</hi> who enjoyed the primacy from 1414 to 1443. I lament to find ſo worthy a man to have been the founder of a building ſo reproachful to his memory as the <hi>Lollards</hi> tower, at the expence of near two hundred and eighty pounds. Neither proteſtants or catholics ſhould omit viſiting this tower, the cruel priſon of the unhappy followers of <hi>Wickliffe.</hi> The vaſt ſtaples and rings, to which they were chained before they were brought to the ſtake, ought to make proteſtants bleſs the hour which freed them from ſo bloody a religion. Catholics may glory, that time has ſoftened their zeal into charity for all ſects, and made them bluſh at theſe memorials of the miſguided zeal of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</p>
            <p>THIS palace ſuffered greatly in the civil wars. After thoſe of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> it was reſtored by archbiſhop <hi>Morton.</hi> He alſo built the gateway; in the lower room of which are ſtill to be ſeen the rings to which the overflowings of the <hi>Lollards</hi> tower were chained.</p>
            <p>AFTER the civil wars of the laſt century,<note place="margin">FANATICAL FURY.</note> when fanatical was united with political fury, it was found that every building de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to piety, had ſuffered more than they had done in all the rage of family conteſt. The fine works of art, and the ſacred memorials of the dead, were, except in a few caſes, ſacrificed to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0170100100:32"/>
puritanical barbariſm, or to ſacrilegious plunder. <hi>Lambeth</hi> tell to the ſhare of the miſcreant regicide <hi>Scot.</hi> He turned the chapel into a hall, and levelled, for that purpoſe, the fine monument of archbiſhop <hi>Parker:</hi> he pulled down the noble hall, the work of <hi>Chichely,</hi> and ſold the materials for his own profit. <hi>Juxon,</hi> on the Reſtoration, found the palace of his predeceſſors a heap of ruins. His piety rebuilt a greater part than could have been expected from the ſhort time he enjoyed the primacy. He rebuilt the great hall on the antient model, when the archbiſhop with his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar friends ſat at the high table: the ſteward with the ſervants, who were gentry of the better rank, ſat at the table on the right hand ſide: the almoner, the clergy, and others, occupied the table on the left. None but nobility or privy counſellors were admitted to the table of the archbiſhop. The biſhops themſelves ſat at the almoner's; the other gueſts at the ſteward's. All the meat which was not conſumed, was regularly given to the idle poor, who waited in crowds at the gate. It is not the defect of charity in modern prelates that this cuſtom is difuſed; but the happy change in the times. Every one muſt now eat the bread of his own induſtry; a much more certain ſupport than the caſual bounty of the great; which misfortunes often prevented, and left the object a prey to miſery and famine. What is ſtyled the luxury of the times, has by no means ſuperſeded deeds of alms. Wealth is more equally diffuſed; but charity is equally great: it paſſes now through many channels, and makes leſs noiſe than when it was poured through fewer ſtreams.</p>

               <note place="margin">LIBRARY.</note>THE fine library in this palace was founded by archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft;</hi> who died in 1610, and left all his books to his ſucceſſors, for ever. The ſucceeding archbiſhop, <hi>Abbot,</hi> bequeathed all his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0170100100:33"/>
books in his great ſtudy, marked C. C. in the ſame unlimited manner.</p>
            <p>ON the ſuppreſſion of epiſcopacy, this valuable library was preſerved by the addreſs of the celebrated Mr. <hi>Selden.</hi> It ſeems that archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> had left his books to his ſucceſſors, on condition that the immediate ſucceſſor was to give bond that they ſhould not be embezzled; but delivered entire from one to the other for ever. On failure of this article, they were to go to <hi>Chelſea College,</hi> in caſe it was built in ſix years after his deceaſe. The college never was finiſhed: but whether any of <hi>Bancroft</hi>'s ſucceſſors gave the ſecurity does not appear. The books were remaining at <hi>Lambeth</hi> in 1646, two years after the execution of archbiſhop <hi>Laud;</hi> when probably fearing for their ſafety in times ſo inimical to learning, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſuggeſted to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> their right to the books; and the whole were delivered into their poſſeſſion. On the Reſtoration, archbiſhop <hi>Juxon</hi> demanded the return of the library; which was repeated by his ſucceſſor <hi>Sheldon,</hi> as founded on the will of the pious foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and they were reſtored accordingly. Archbiſhop <hi>Sheldon</hi> added a conſiderable number: and archbiſhop <hi>Teniſon</hi> augmented it with part of his books.</p>
            <p>THAT very worthy prelate archbiſhop <hi>Secker,</hi> beſides a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſum expended on making catalogues to the old regiſters of the ſee, left to the library all ſuch books from his own, as were not in the former, which comprehended much the largeſt and moſt valuable part of his own collection.</p>
            <p>ARCHBISHOP <hi>Cornwallis</hi> beſtowed many valuable books in his life-time. And the preſent archbiſhop has given a conſiderable ſum for fitting up a proper repoſitory for the valuable collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

here was founded, in 1765, this humane preventative <hi>The Weſtminſter New Lying-in Hoſpital.</hi> To obviate all objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its being an encouragement to vice, no one is taken in a ſecond time: but this moſt excellent charity is open to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy diſtreſſed matron as often as neceſſity requires.

diſcharged for faults and irregularities.—How to be dreaded is the entrance into the bounds of vice, ſince the retreat from its paths is ſo difficult!

            <p>A LITTLE to the weſt of this church is a lane called <hi>Stoney ſtreet,</hi> which ran down to the water-ſide, nearly oppoſite to <hi>Dow</hi>-gate, and probably was the continuation of the <hi>Watling-ſtreet</hi> road. This is ſuppoſed to have been a <hi>Roman Trajectus,</hi> and the ferry from <hi>Londinum</hi> into the province of <hi>Cantium.</hi> Marks of the antient cauſey have been diſcovered on the <hi>London</hi> ſide. On this, the name evinces the origin. The <hi>Saxons</hi> always give the name of <hi>Street</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> roads; and here they gave it the addition of <hi>Stein</hi> or <hi>Stoney,</hi> from the pavement they found it compoſed of.</p>
            <p>DEADMAN's <hi>place</hi> lies a little farther: tradition ſays that it took its name from the number of dead interred there in the great plague, ſoon after the Reſtoration.</p>
            <p>FROM the calamity which deſtroyed this church, and the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious houſe, in the year 1207, aroſe one of our nobleſt hoſpitals, that of <hi>St. Thomas.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ST. THOMAS'S HOSPITAL.</note> After the fire, the canons built, at a ſmall diſtance from the priory, an occaſional building for their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till their houſe could be re-built. But in 1215, <hi>Peter de Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibus,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> diſliking the ſituation, removed it to a place on which <hi>Richard,</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi> prior of <hi>Bermondſey,</hi> had, in 1213, erected a hoſpital for converts and poor children, which he called the <hi>Almery. Peter de Rupibus</hi> new founded it for canons regular, and endowed it with three hundred and forty-four pounds a year. It was held from the prior and abbot of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondſey,</hi> till the year 1428, when a compoſition was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

At the diſſolution it was ſurrendered into the hands of the king. In 1552, it was founded a third time by the citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who purchaſed the ſuppreſſed hoſpital: in <hi>July</hi> they began the reparation, and in <hi>November</hi> following, opened it for the reception of the ſick and poor; not fewer than two hundred and ſixty were the firſt objects of the charity. The patron was at the ſame time changed: the turbulent <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> very properly giving place to the worthy apoſtle <hi>St. Thomas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TOWARDS the end of the laſt century, the building fell into decay. In the year 1699 the governors ſolicited the benevolence of the public for its ſupport: and with ſuch ſucceſs, that they were enabled to re-build it on the magnificent and extenſive plan we now ſee. It conſiſts of three courts, with colonnades be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each: three wards were built at the ſole coſt of <hi>Thomas Frederic,</hi> eſquire, of <hi>London:</hi> and three by <hi>Thomas Guy,</hi> citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and ſtationer. The whole containing eighteen wards, and 442 beds. The expences attending this foundation are about £. 10,000 a year. In the middle of the ſecond court is a ſtatue in braſs of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and beneath him the repreſentation of the halt and maimed.</p>
            <p>IN that of the third court is a ſtone ſtatue of Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> knight, lord mayor of <hi>London,</hi> dreſſed in character, in his gown and chain.

The relation is very remarkable. At the age of ſeventy-ſix, he took a leaſe, of the governors of the former, of a piece of ground oppoſite to it, for the term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years, and on it, in 1721, at the expence of £. 18,793. 16 <hi>s.</hi> began to build the hoſpital which bears his name: and left to endow it, the prodigious ſum of £. 219,499, amaſſed from a very ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, chiefly by purchaſing ſeamen's tickets, in the reign of queen <hi>Anne;</hi> and by his great ſucceſs in the buying and ſelling South Sea ſtock, in the memorable year 1720; and alſo a vaſt ſum by the ſale of bibles. He ſeems to have profited both of GOD and <hi>Mammon.</hi> I think he was a native of <hi>Tamworth,</hi> and repreſentative for that borough. His death happened on <hi>December</hi> 27th, 1724; before which he ſaw his hoſpital covered with the roof. In the firſt court is his ſtatue in braſs, dreſſed in his livery gown. Beſides his public expences, he gave, during life, to many of his poor relations, £. 10 or £. 20 a year; and to others money to advance them in life; to his aged relations, £. 870 in annuities; and to his younger relations and executors, the ſum of £. 75,589!</p>

I was told that at this time there were only two hundred beds: three wards being out of uſe, undergoing certain alterations.

The king dedicated his new church to <hi>St. Peter;</hi> who deſcended in perſon, with a hoſt of heavenly choriſters, to ſave the biſhop of <hi>Mellitus</hi> the trouble of conſecration. The ſaint deſcended on the <hi>Surry</hi> ſide, in a ſtormy night; but, prevaling on <hi>Edric,</hi> a fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to waft him over, performed the ceremony: and, as a proof, left behind the chriſm, and precious droppings of the wax candles, with which the aſtoniſhed fiſherman ſaw the church illuminated. He conveyed the ſaint ſafely back; who directed him to inform the biſhop that there was no farther need of conſecration. He likewiſe directed <hi>Edric</hi> to fling out his nets, who was rewarded with a miraculous draft of falmons: the ſaint alſo promiſed to the fiſherman and his ſucceſſors, that they never ſhould want plenty of ſalmon, provided they preſented every tenth to his church. This cuſtom was obſerved till at leſt the year 1382. The fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that day had a right to ſit at the ſame table with the prior; and he might demand of the cellerer, ale and bread; and the cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerer again might take of the fiſh's tail as much as he could, with four fingers and his thumb erect.</p>
               <p>THE place in which it was built was then ſtyled <hi>Thornie</hi> iſland, from its being over-run with thorns and briers; and it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides inſulated by a branch of the <hi>Thames.</hi> This church was burnt by the <hi>Danes;</hi>

In 1245 he began this great work, in the mode of architecture which began to take place in his days. He did not live to complete his deſign, which was carried on by his ſucceſſor, and finiſhed in his fourteenth year.

<q>He brought from thence certain workmen, and rich por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phery ſtones, whereof hee made that curious, ſingular, rare pavement before the high altar; and with theſe ſtones and workmen he did alſo frame the ſhrine of <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor <note n="‡" place="bottom">Funeral Monuments, 485.</note>.</q>
This beautiful memorial conſiſts of three rows of arches; the lower pointed: the upper round. And on each ſide of the lower is a moſt elegant twiſted pillar, an ornament the artiſt ſeems peculiarly fond of. Children, or childiſh age, has greatly injured this beautiful ſhrine, by picking out the moſaic, through the ſhameful connivance of the attendant vergers.</p>

Let me only obſerve, that here may be read an excellent lecture on the progreſs of theſe efforts of human ſkill, from the ſimple altar tomb to the moſt oſtentatious proofs of human vanity. The humble recumbent figure with uplifted hands, as if deprecating the juſtice of Heaven for the offences of this mortal ſtate; or the proper kneeling attitude, ſupplicating that mercy which the pureſt muſt ſtand in need of, may be ſeen here in various degrees of elegance. The careleſs lolling attitude of heroes in long gowns and flowing perriwigs, next ſucceed; and after them, buſts or ſtatues vaunting their merits, and attended with ſuch a train of <hi>Pagan</hi> deities, that would almoſt lead to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe oneſelf in a heathen <hi>Pantheon</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> church.</p>

               <p>THE figure of Doctor <hi>Buſby,</hi> maſter of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſchool, who died in 1695, is elegant and ſpirited.

               <p>THIS picture, after the teſt of near four hundred years, is in the higheſt preſervation; and not leſs remarkable for the elegance of the coloring, than the excellent drawing, conſidering the early age of the performance. We muſt allow it had been re-painted; but nothing ſeems altered, if we may collect from the print made by <hi>Vertue,</hi> excepting a correction in the ſite of the croſs iſſuing out of the globe. The back ground is elevated above the figure, of an uneven ſurface, and gilt. The curious will find, in Mr. <hi>Walpole</hi>'s Anecdotes, vol. i. an ingenious conjecture of the method of painting in that early period, which has given ſuch amazing duration to the labors of its artiſts.</p>
               <p>THIS portrait was originally hung up in the choir of the abby; but about a dozen years ago was removed to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> chamber.</p>

His queen <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi> had before erected his monument, and placed his image, cut in heart of oak, and covered over with ſilver, on an altar tomb; the head was (as the guide tells us) of ſolid ſilver, which, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. was ſacrilegiouſly ſtolen away. The wooden headleſs trunk ſtill remains.</p>
               <p>ON each ſide of this royal chapel is a winding ſtaircaſe, incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a turret of open iron-work, which leads into a chauntry founded for the purpoſe of maſſes, for the repoſe of the ſoul of this great prince. The front looks over the ſhrine of the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. Here is kept a parcel of human figures, which in old times were dreſſed out and carried at funeral proceſſions; but at preſent very deſervedly have got the name of the <hi>ragged regiment.</hi> More worthy of notice is the elegant termination of the <hi>columellae</hi> of the two ſtaircaſes, which ſpread at the top of the turrets into roofs of uncommon elegance.</p>
               <p>ONE end of this chauntry reſts againſt that of the chapel of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. Among the ſtone ſtatues placed there is the <hi>French</hi> patron <hi>St. Dennis,</hi> moſt compoſedly carrying his head in his hand.</p>
               <p>ON the ſouth ſide of the chauntry, over his monument, is the repreſentation of his coronation. The figure of <hi>Henry</hi> is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by a wen under his chin.

One pretence is a reſpect to his grandmother, whoſe bones he left flung into an ordinary cheſt.

               <p>ON the diſſolution, this great monaſtery, the ſecond mitred abby in the kingdom, underwent the common lot of the religious houſes. In 1534, the abbot, <hi>William Benſon,</hi> ſubſcribed to the king's ſupremacy, and in 1539 ſurrendered his monaſtery into the royal hands, and received as a reward the office of firſt dean to the new foundation, conſiſting of a dean and twelve preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries. He alſo erected it into a biſhoprick, but its only bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was <hi>Thomas Thirleby;</hi> it being ſuppreſſed in 1550, on his tranſlation to <hi>Norwich.</hi> When the protector <hi>Somerſet</hi> ruled in the fulneſs of power, this magnificent, this ſacred pile narrowly eſcaped a total demolition. It was his deſign to have pulled it down to the ground, and to have applied the materials towards the palace he was then erecting in the <hi>Strand,</hi> known by the name of <hi>Somerſet</hi>-houſe. He was diverted from his deſign by a bribe of not fewer than fourteen manors.— Mortals ſhould be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate in pronouncing the vengeance of Heaven on their fellow-creatures: yet, in this inſtance, without preſumption, without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, one may ſuppoſe his fall to have been marked out by the Almighty, as a warning to impious men. He fell on the ſcaffold on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> lamented only becauſe his overthrow was effected by a man more wicked, more ambitious, and more deteſted than himſelf. In their ends there was a conſent of juſtice: both died by the ax: and both of their headleſs bodies were flung, within a very ſhort ſpace, into the ſame place, among the attainted herd.</p>
               <p>IN the reign of queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the former religion of the place experienced a brief reſtoration. She with great zeal reſtored it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0170100100:90"/>
to the antient conventual ſtate; collected many of the rich habits and inſignia of that ſplendid worſhip; eſtabliſhed fourteen monks, and appointed for their abbot <hi>John Feckenham,</hi> a man of great piety and learning, who, on his expulſion in the ſucceeding reign, finiſhed his days in eaſy cuſtody in <hi>Wiſbech</hi> caſtle.</p>
               <p>IN 1560 it was changed into a collegiate church, conſiſting of a dean and twelve ſecular canons, and thirty petty canons, and other members, two ſchool-maſters, and forty king's or queen's ſcholars, twelve almſmen, and many officers and ſervants <note n="*" place="bottom">Tanner.</note>. But there ſeems to have been a ſchool there from the firſt foundation of the abby. <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> abbot of <hi>Crowland,</hi> ſpeaks of his having been educated at it; and of the diſputations he had with the queen of the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> and of the preſents ſhe made him in money in his boyiſh days <note n="†" place="bottom">Quoted by <hi>Stow,</hi> book 1. vol. i. 123.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">CLOISTERS, AND CHAPTER-HOUSE.</note>BESIDES the church, many of the antient parts remain. The cloiſters are entire, and filled with monuments. The north and weſt cloiſters were built by abbot <hi>Littlington,</hi> who died in 1386: he alſo built the granary, which was afterwards the dormitory of the king's ſcholars; of later years rebuilt.</p>
               <p>THE entrance into the chapter-houſe (built in 1250) is on one ſide of the cloiſter, through a moſt rich and magnificent gothic portal, the mouldings moſt exquiſitely carved: this is divided into two gothic doors. After a deſcent of ſeveral ſteps, is the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-houſe, an octagon, each ſide of which had moſt ſuperb and lofty windows, now filled up, and lighted by leſſer.

The central pillar remains, light, ſlender, and elegant, ſurrounded by eight others; bound by two equidiſtant <hi>faſciae,</hi> and terminated in capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of beautiful ſimplicity. By conſent of the abbot, in 1377, the commons of <hi>Great Britain</hi> firſt held their parlements in his place; the crown undertaking the repairs.

               <p>HENRY had an uncommon compoſition: his ſavage cruelty could not ſuppreſs his love of the arts: his love of the arts could not ſoften his ſavage cruelty. The prince who could, with the utmoſt <hi>ſang froid,</hi> burn Catholics and Proteſtants, take off the heads of the partners of his bed one day, and celebrate new nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials the next, had, notwithſtanding, a ſtrong taſte for refined plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.

               <p>IN 1700 <hi>Bond-ſtreet</hi> was built no farther than the weſt end of <hi>Clifford-ſtreet.

               <p>AS <hi>Charles</hi> II. did not find it compatible with his gallantries that his ſpouſe <hi>Catherine</hi> ſhould be reſident at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> he lodged her, during ſome part of his reign, in this palace. This made it the haunt of the Catholics: and poſſibly, during the phrenetic rage of the nation at that period againſt the profeſſors of her religion, occaſioned it to have been made the pretended ſcene of the murder of Sir <hi>Edmonbury Godfrey,</hi>

The murder therefore was not by robbers, but the effect of private revenge: but it is not probable that it was committed within theſe walls; for the aſſaſſins would never have hazarded a diſcovery by carrying the corpſe three miles, when they could have ſo ſafely diſpoſed of it into the <hi>Thames.</hi> The abandoned characters of the evidences, <hi>Prance</hi> and <hi>Bedloe</hi> (the former of whom had been treated with moſt horrid cruelties, to compel him to confeſs what he declared he never was guilty of) together with the abſurd and irreconcileable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony they gave on the trial, has made unprejudiced times to doubt the whole. That he was murdered there is no doubt: he had been an active magiſtrate, and had made many enemies. The marks of ſtrangling round his throat, and his broken neck, evince the impoſſibility of his having put an end to his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, as ſome have inſinuated. But the innocence of the three poor convicts would not avail, the torrent of prejudice prevaling againſt them; and they were executed, denying the facts in the moment of death. One was a Proteſtant: the other two <hi>Roman Catholics,</hi> and belonging to the chapel; ſo probably were fixed on, by the inſtigators of the accuſation, in order to involve the queen in the uncharitable ſuſpicion.</p>

               <p>ST. GILES's church, and a few houſes to the weſt of it,<note place="margin">ST. GILES'S IN THE FIELDS.</note> in the year 1600, was but barely ſeparated from <hi>Broad-ſtreet.</hi> The church is ſuppoſed to have belonged to an hoſpital for lepers, founded about the year 1117, by <hi>Matilda</hi> queen to <hi>Henry</hi> I. In antient times it was cuſtomary to preſent to malefactors, on their way to the gallows (which, about the year 1413, was removed from <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and placed between <hi>St. Giles</hi>'s <hi>High-ſtreet,</hi> and <hi>Hog-lane</hi>) a great bowl of ale, as the laſt refreſhment they were to receive in this life <note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>HERE was executed, in the moſt barbarous manner, the famous Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle,</hi> baron <hi>Cobham.</hi> His crime was that of adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the tenets of <hi>Wycliffe.</hi> He was miſrepreſented to our heroic prince, <hi>Henry</hi> V. by the bigoted clergy, as a heretic and traitor; and that he was actually at the head of thirty thouſand <hi>Lollards,</hi> in theſe very fields. About a hundred inoffenſive people were found there: <hi>Cobham</hi> eſcaped; but was taken ſome time after in <hi>Wales.</hi> He ſuffered death on this ſpot: was hung on a gallows, by a chain faſtened round his body, and, thus ſuſpended, burnt alive. He died, not with the calm conſtancy of a martyr, but with the wildeſt effuſions of enthuſiaſtic ravings.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">CHURCH.</note>THIS church was rebuilt in 1625. By the amazing raiſing of the ground by filth, and various adventitious matter, the floor, in the year 1730, was eight feet below the ſurface acquired in the intervening time. This alone made it neceſſary to rebuild the church, in the preſent century. The firſt ſtone was laid in 1730; it was finiſhed in 1734, at the expence of ten thouſand pounds, in a manner which does great credit to its architect, Mr. <hi>Henry Flitcraft.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the church-yard I have obſerved with horror a great ſquare pit, with many rows of coffins piled one upon the other, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſight and ſmell. Some of the piles were incomplete, expecting the mortality of the night. I turned away diſguſted at the view, and ſcandalized at the want of police, which ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the health of the living as to permit ſo many putrid corpſes, tacked between ſome flight boards, diſperſing their dangerous effluvia over the capital.</p>
               <p>NEAR the church was the houſe of <hi>Alice</hi> dutcheſs <hi>Dudley,</hi> who died here in 1669, aged ninety.

She merited the honor by the greatneſs of her mind and extent of her charities. Her body was interred at <hi>Stonely,</hi> in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> the place of her family, ſhe being third daughter of Sir <hi>Thomas Leigh,</hi> of <hi>Stonely,</hi> anceſtor of the late lord <hi>Leigh.</hi> A fine monument was erected to her honor at <hi>Stonely</hi>

               <p>THE mention of <hi>St. Giles</hi>'s <hi>bowl,</hi> naturally brings one to the late place of the concluſion of human laws. It was called in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> III. when the gentle <hi>Mortimer</hi> finiſhed his days here, <hi>The Elms;</hi> but the original as well as preſent name was <hi>Tybourne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TYBOURNE.</note> not from <hi>tye</hi> and <hi>burn,</hi> as if it was called ſo from the manner of capital puniſhments, but from <hi>Bourne,</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> word for a brook, which gave name to a manor before the Conqueſt. Here was alſo a village and church denominated <hi>St. John the Evangeliſt,</hi> which fell to decay, and was ſucceeded by that of <hi>Mary bourne,</hi> corrupted into <hi>Mary-la-bonne.</hi> About the year 1238, this brook furniſhed nine conduits for ſupplying the city with water: but the introduction of the New River ſuperſeded the uſe of them. Here the lord mayor had a banquetting-houſe, to which his lordſhip and brethren were wont to repair on horſeback, attended by their ladies in waggons: and, after viewing the conduits, they returned to the city, where they were magnificently entertained by the lord mayor <note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>THE chapel (which was dedicated to <hi>St. Etheldreda,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CHAPEL.</note> foundreſs of the monaſtery at <hi>Ely</hi>) has at the eaſt end a very handſome <hi>gothic</hi> window, which looks into a neat court, lately built, called <hi>Ely-place.</hi> Beneath is a crypt of the length of the chapel.

               <p>THE ſeveral buildings belonging to this palace falling into ruin, it was thought proper to enable, by act of parlement, in 1772, the biſhop to alienate the whole. It was accordingly ſold to the crown, for the ſum of ſix thouſand five hundred pounds, together with an annuity of two hundred pounds a year, to be payed to the biſhop and his ſucceſſors for ever. Out of the firſt, five thouſand ſix hundred was applied towards the purchaſe of <hi>Albemarle-houſe,</hi> in <hi>Dover-ſtreet,</hi> with other meſſuages and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. The remainder, together with three thouſand pounds paid as dilapidations by the executors of biſhop <hi>Mawſon,</hi> was applied

towards building the handſome houſe at preſent occupied, in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſtreet,</hi> by my reſpected friend the preſent prelate. This was named <hi>Ely-houſe,</hi> and is ſettled on the biſhops of <hi>Ely</hi> for ever. It was the fortune of that munificent prelate <hi>Edmund Keene,</hi> to rebuild or repair more eccleſiaſtical houſes than any churchman of modern days. He beſtowed moſt conſiderable repairs on the parſonage-houſe of <hi>Stanhope,</hi> in the biſhoprick of <hi>Durham.</hi> He wholly rebuilt the palace at <hi>Cheſter.</hi> He reſtored almoſt from rain that at <hi>Ely;</hi> and, finally, <hi>Ely-houſe</hi> was built under his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection.</p>

the unfortunate Armourer entered into the liſts, on account of a falſe accuſation of treaſon, brought againſt him by his apprentice, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI.

Here our martyr <hi>Latimer</hi> preached patience to friar <hi>Foreſt,</hi> agonizing under the torture of a ſlow fire, for denying the king's ſupremacy: and to this place our martyr <hi>Cranmer</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the amiable <hi>Edward,</hi> by forcing his reluctant hand to the warrant, to ſend <hi>Joan Bocher,</hi> a ſilly woman, to the ſtake. Yet <hi>Latimer</hi> never thought of his own conduct in his laſt moments; nor did <hi>Cranmer</hi> thruſt his hand into the fire for a real crime, but for one which was venial through the frailty of human nature.</p>

Many able mathematicians and ſeamen have ſprung from this inſtitution. In the laſt year, a hundred and ſixty-eight were apprenticed out; of which nine were from the laſt-mentioned inſtitution.

               <p>NO one ought to be ignorant that this unſpeakable benefit is owing to a WELSHMAN! Sir HUGH MIDDELTON, of <hi>Denbigh;</hi> who, on <hi>September</hi> 20th, 1608, began, and on <hi>September</hi> 29th, 1613, completed the great work.

Yet it was impoſſible to eſcape difficulties. His daring ſpirit penetrated the hills in ſeveral places: and carried the river over two vallies. Over one it extended ſix hundred and ſixty feet in length, and thirty in height; and over another, four hundred and ſixty-two feet in length. The original ſource of this river was, by the vaſt increaſe of <hi>London,</hi> found inadequate to its wants. The New River company found it neceſſary to have recourſe to another ſupply. They applied to parlement for powers to obtain it from the river <hi>Lee,</hi> the property of the city. <hi>London</hi> oppoſed the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit intended its inhabitants; but in vain, parlement wiſely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined againſt their objections: ſo the bleſſing was forced upon them! and the river <hi>Lee</hi> ſupplies the greater part of the wants of the city. Sir HUGH MIDDELTON was ruined by the execution of his project. So little was the benefit underſtood, that, for above thirty years, the ſeventy-two ſhares, it was divided into, ſhared only five pounds apiece. Each of theſe ſhares was ſold originally for a hundred pounds. Within this twelvemonth they were ſold at nine thouſand pounds a ſhare; and lately at ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand: and are increaſing, becauſe their profits increaſe, on which their dividends are grounded. Half of the ſeventy-two ſhares

               <p>THIS canal was afterwards neglected, and became a nuſance; was filled up, and a ſewer formed beneath to convey the water to the river.

A dirty fellow invited you in. The parſon was ſeen walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſhop; a ſqualid profligate figure, clad in a tattered plaid night-gown, with a fiery face, and ready to couple you for a dram of gin, or roll of tobacco.

               <p>I SHALL now give a general view of the <hi>Walls,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CITY WALLS.</note> the antient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the city; and of the <hi>Town-ditch,</hi> a work of conſiderable labor. In my progreſs I ſhall point out whatſoever was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the adjacent ſuburbs, or the parts within the city which border on the walls. There never was any alteration made in the courſe of this firſt precinct, which was preſerved through all ſucceeding ages; and in every reparation or additional ſtrength which was thought neceſſary. Its direction was from the firſt irregular. The <hi>Romans,</hi> as was frequently the caſe, conſulted the neceſſity of the ground <note n="*" place="bottom">Vegetius.</note>. It commenced at the <hi>Palatine-tower,</hi> ran in a ſtrait line along the eminence of <hi>Ludgate-hill,</hi> and above <hi>Fleet-ditch,</hi> as far as <hi>Newgate;</hi> then ſuddenly was carried north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly to a ſpot a little beyond <hi>Alderſgate,</hi> and at that place ran ſtrait in a northern direction almoſt to <hi>Cripplegate;</hi> from whence it reſumed a ſtrait eaſtern courſe as far as <hi>Biſhopſgate,</hi> in which a long remnant of the wall, ſtill called <hi>London Wall,</hi> is to be ſeen. From <hi>Biſhopſgate</hi> it aſſumes a gentle curvature pointed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> over the ſite of which it originally paſſed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably finiſhed in a <hi>Caſtellum</hi> in this, as it did in the weſtern extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Another wall guarded the river, and ran the whole length
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0170100100:230"/>
of the ſouth ſide of the city, on the direction of the vaſt ſtreet called <hi>Thames-ſtreet.</hi> But all this I ſhall particularize in my walk round the antient walls.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">TOWN-DITCH.</note>I SHALL firſt mention another conſiderable addition to the ſtrength of thoſe fortifications. The <hi>Town-ditch</hi> was a ſtupendous piece of work, began in the reign of king <hi>John,</hi> in 1211, by the <hi>Londoners</hi> themſelves, poſſibly as a protection againſt their own monarch; who, in reſentment to them, had juſt removed the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer to <hi>Northampton.</hi> It was two hundred feet broad, and extended, on the outſide of the walls, from <hi>Tower-ditch</hi> quite to <hi>Chriſt's Hoſpital.</hi> Notwithſtanding the multitude of hands em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, it was not finiſhed in leſs than two years. It was filled with water, as is evident from the quantity of good fiſh <hi>Stow</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us was taken in it <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Survaie,</hi> i. p. 47.</note>. The citizens for ſome centuries were at great expence in cleanſing and keeping it open: but, after the laſt attempt, in 1595, the work was given over, it became ſtable land, and was ſoon covered with buildings.</p>
               <p>THE weſtern wall terminated near the river with a ſort, which I apprehend to have been the caſtle of <hi>Montfitchet,</hi> ſoon to be mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">BLACK FRIARS.</note>WITHIN the walls, oppoſite to <hi>Bridewell,</hi> ſtood the great houſe of <hi>Black Friars,</hi> or <hi>Dominicans;</hi> founded by the intereſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of <hi>Robert Kilwarby,</hi> archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> about 1276; when <hi>Gregory Rockſley,</hi> and the barons of <hi>London,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with the ground. <hi>Edward</hi> I. and his queen <hi>Elianor</hi> became great benefactors; by the aſſiſtance of whom, the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop built the monaſtery, and a large church richly ornamented.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0170100100:231"/>
This obtained every immunity which any religious houſe had. Its precinct was very large, had four gates, and contained numbers of ſhops; the inhabitants of which were ſubject only to the king, the ſuperior of the houſe, and their own juſtices. It alſo became a ſanctuary for debtors, and even malefactors; a privilege which it preſerved even long after the ſuppreſſion of religious houſes.</p>
               <p>To make way for this foundation, two lanes were pulled down, and part of the city wall; which laſt was rebuilt immediately by a charter granted by <hi>Edward</hi> I. for that purpoſe.<note place="margin">CASTLE OF MONTFICHET.</note> The caſtle of <hi>Montfichet</hi> alſo fell a ſacrifice to this houſe. It was built by <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert de Montfichet,</hi> a follower of the Conqueror: and, growing ruinous, by gift of the king the materials were uſed for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the church, on the ſite of this antient tower. The church became a faſhionable place of interment of people of rank; and to be buried in the habit of the order, was thought to be a ſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt the attacks of the devil. Among other illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſonages was <hi>Hubert de Burgh,</hi> earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> and his wife <hi>Margaret,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Alexander</hi> II. king of <hi>Scotland;</hi> the heart of queen <hi>Elianor;</hi> lord <hi>Fanhope;</hi> that patron of learning <hi>John Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toft,</hi> earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> beheaded in 1470; <hi>James Touchet,</hi> earl of <hi>Audley,</hi> beheaded in 1497; Sir <hi>Thomas Brandon,</hi> knight of the Garter; <hi>William Courteney,</hi> earl of <hi>Devonſhire;</hi> and much other great and noble duſt.</p>
               <p>IN the ſame church were alſo held ſeveral parlements. The remarkable one of 1450, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. was adjourned from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to this place; here the weak monarch vainly endeavoured to divert the ſtorm raiſed by his ſubjects againſt the favorite of his queen, <hi>William de la Pole,</hi> duke of <hi>Suffolk;</hi> and by a poor expedient, a ſimulated <hi>exile,</hi> drove him to inſtant death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0170100100:232"/>HERE, in 1524, <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. held another, in order to oppreſs his ſubjects with an aid of eight hundred thouſand pounds, to carry on his imprudent wars. The virtue of the commons reſiſted the demand, and gave him ony a moderate tax. This was called the <hi>Black</hi> parlement, as it began amongſt the <hi>Black Monks,</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and ended among the <hi>Black Friars.</hi>
               </p>

And in this place <hi>Wolſey</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fell from all his greatneſs; for here began the parlement which gave the ſentence of <hi>premunire,</hi> the laſt ſtroke to all his proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>WITH all the great events which honored this houſe, its reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, at the diſſolution, were only one hundred pounds fifteen ſhillings and five pence. Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> held it <hi>in commendam;</hi> and in 1538, with fifteen brethren, ſurrendered it to the king. <hi>Edward</hi> VI. afterwards granted it to Sir <hi>Thomas Cawarden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the reign of queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>Black Friars</hi> became a place much inhabited by people of faſhion. Among others, lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> ſon of <hi>William,</hi> fourth earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> had a houſe here, which queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in 1600, honored with her preſence, on occaſion of his nuptials with the daughter and heireſs of <hi>John</hi> lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> ſon of <hi>Francis</hi> earl of <hi>Bedford.</hi> The queen was met at the water-ſide by the bride, and carried to her houſe in a <hi>lectica</hi> by ſix knights; her majeſty dined there, and ſupped in the ſame neighborhood, with lord <hi>Cobham;</hi> where there was
<q>a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maſke of 8 ladies, and a ſtraunge dawnce new invented.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0170100100:233"/>
Their attire is this: each hath a ſkirt of cloth of ſilver; a rich waſtcoat wrought with ſilkes, and gold and ſilver; a mantell of carnacion taffete, caſt under the arme; and there haire looſe about there ſhoulders, curiouſly knotted and interlaced. Mrs. <hi>Fitton</hi> leade; theſe 8 ladys maſkets chooſe 8 ladies more to dawnce the meaſures.

At this time the queen was ſixty: ſurely, as Mr. WALPOLE obſerved, it was at that period as natural for her to be in love!—I muſt not forget, that in her paſſage from the bride's to lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s, ſhe went through the houſe of Doctor <hi>Puddin,</hi> and was preſented by the doctor with a fan.—The <hi>Count de Tillier,</hi> ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> in the latter end of the reign of <hi>James</hi> I. reſided here.

In the midſt of the diſcourſe the floor fell, and ninety-four perſons, beſides the preacher, periſhed. It is diſguſting to reflect on the uncharitable bigotry of the times.

               <p>BY this charter, barbers were not to practiſe ſurgery, farther than drawing of teeth: and ſurgeons were ſtrictly prohibited from
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0170100100:254"/>
the feat or craft of barbery, or ſhaving. Uſe was to make both perfect. But by the year 1745, it having been diſcovered, that the above arts were foreign to, and independent of each other, the barbers and the ſurgeons were, by act of parlement, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and made diſtinct corporations. It was very fit that an aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, which was now become ludicrous, ſhould be diſſolved: our ſurgeons began at that period to riſe into great fame. True it is, that pupils then went to <hi>Paris</hi> to improve in the art: at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>Europe</hi> looks up to our ſurgeons as on the ſummit of the profeſſion.</p>
               <p>IT will be curious to turn back from theſe times to thoſe of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. to compare the ſtate of ſurgery: when at one time there were very few, as <hi>Gale</hi> tells us, worthy to be called ſurgeons. His account of thoſe employed in the army is very humorous. "I remember," ſays he,
<q>when I was in the wars at <hi>Muttrel (Montreuil)</hi> in the time of that moſt famous prince king <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. there was a great rabblement, that took on them to be ſurgeons: ſome were ſow-gelders, and ſome horſe-gelders, with tinkers, and coblers. This noble ſect did ſuch great cures, that they got themſelves a perpetual name; for, like as <hi>Theſſalus</hi>'s ſect were called <hi>Theſſalions,</hi> ſo was this noble rabblement, for their notorious cures, called <hi>Dog-leaches;</hi> for in two dreſſings they did commonly make their cures whole and found for ever; ſo that they neither felt heat nor cold, nor no manner of pain after. But when the duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who was then general, underſtood how the people did die, and that of ſmall wounds, he ſent for me, and certain other ſurgeons, commanding us to make ſearch how theſe men came to their death; whether it were by the grievouſneſs of their wounds, or by the lack of knowledge of the ſurgeons; and we, according
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0170100100:255"/>
to our commandment, made ſearch through all the camp; and found many of the ſame good fellows, which took upon them the names of ſurgeons; not only the names, but the wages alſo. We aſking of them whether they were ſurgeons or no, they ſaid they were; we demanded with whom they were brought up, and they, with ſhameleſs faces, would anſwer, either with one cunning man, or another, which was dead. Then we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them what chirurgery ſtuff they had to cure men withal; and they would ſhew us a pot, or a box, which they had in a budget; wherein was ſuch trumpery as they did uſe to greaſe horſes heels withal, and laid upon ſcabbed horſes backs, with rewal, and ſuch like. And others, that were cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and tinkers, they uſed ſhoe-maker's wax, with the ruſt of old pans, and made therewithal a noble ſalve, as they did term it. But in the end, this worthy rabblement was committed to the <hi>Marſhalſea,</hi> and threatened, by the duke's grace, to be hanged for their worthy deeds, except they would declare the truth what they were, and of what occupations; and in the end they did confeſs, as I have declared to you before <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Blood</hi> contrived, under the guiſe of a clergyman, to make acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Mr. <hi>Edwards;</hi> inſinuated himſelf into his favor and confidence. After various viſits, with the aſſiſtance of ſeveral other aſſociates, he ſeized on the old man, whom he had requeſted to ſhew the jewels to his friends, gagged him, and on his reſiſting, ſtruck him on the head with a mallet, and gave him ſeveral ſtabs. <hi>Edwards</hi> thought it prudent to counterfeit death. <hi>Blood</hi> put the crown under his parſon's gown: another put the globe in his breeches: a third, not being able to conceal the ſceptre by reaſon of its length, broke off the rich ruby and put it in his pocket. As ſoon as they were gone, <hi>Edwards</hi> forced out the gag, and gave the alarm; they were inſtantly purſued, and three of them

               <p>THE curioſity of the king was excited to ſee a man engaged in ſo many important villanies: under pretence of obtaining diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, his majeſty made the wretch a viſit; from that moment the artful <hi>Blood</hi> dated his ſecurity: he told the king ſo many plauſible tales; ſuch indifference he ſhewed for his own life, ſuch anxiety for that of his majeſty (for he inſinuated that his comrades would certainly revenge his death, even on his ſacred majeſty) that in a ſhort time he obtained his pardon. It was neceſſary to apply to the duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> for permiſſion, the ruffian having made the attempt on his grace's life not long before. The duke nobly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<q>If his majeſty could forgive him ſtealing the crown, he might eaſily forgive the attempt upon his life; and if ſuch was his majeſty's pleaſure, that was a ſufficient reaſon for him, and his lordſhip (the earl of <hi>Arlington,</hi> who brought the meſſage) might ſpare the reſt.</q>
                  <hi>Blood</hi> was not only pardoned, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into favor, had a penſion of five hundred a year, and was perpetually ſeen at court, enjoying the ſmiles of majeſty, and even ſucceſsfully employing his intereſt, as a moſt reſpectable patron. But all good men looked on him with horror, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered him as a <hi>Sicarius</hi> to a profligate ſet of men, to overawe any who had integrity enough to reſiſt the meaſures of a moſt profligate court. This miſcreant died peacefully in his bed, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> 29th, 1680, fearleſsly, and without any ſigns of penitence; totally hardened and forſaken by Heaven.</p>

                  <note place="margin">ST. CATHERINE'S HOSPITAL.</note> is the hoſpital of <hi>St. Catherine</hi>'s, originally founded in 1148, by <hi>Matilda</hi> of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> wife of king <hi>Stephen,</hi> for the repoſe of her ſon <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>

and her daughter <hi>Matilda:</hi> and for the maintenance of a maſter, brothers and ſiſters, and other poor perſons. In 1273, <hi>Elinor,</hi> widow of <hi>Henry,</hi> poſſeſſed herſelf of it, diſſolved the old foundation, refounded it in honor of the ſame ſaint, for a maſter, three brethren chaplains, three ſiſters, ten <hi>Bedes</hi> women, and ſix poor ſcholars. Queen <hi>Philippa,</hi> wife of <hi>Edward</hi> III. was a great benefactreſs to this hoſpital: and to this day it remains under queenly patronage, according to the reſervation made by the pious re-foundreſs <hi>Elinor.</hi> Our preſent gracious queen is the twenty-ninth royal patroneſs.</p>
               <p>THE maſterſhip is a ſinecure of conſiderable value. In this hoſpital is a houſe for him, and all its members. The reader will find the diſpoſition of them, in the plan printed by Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> in the account of <hi>St. Katherine</hi>'s hoſpital, and its colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate church; a poſthumous work of that able antiquary the late <hi>Andrew Coltee Ducarel,</hi> LL. D. He was interred in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate church, where a plain piece of marble informs us of little more than the period of his exiſtence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">CHURCH.</note>THE church is a handſome <hi>gothic</hi> building, but almoſt quite loſt in the various houſes, which ſhut it up from public view. The eaſt window is very elegant; and in the modern improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there is the utmoſt propriety preſerved in the imitation of the antient architecture. The wooden pulpit is a curioſity: on its eight ſides are repreſented the antient building, and different gates of the hoſpital; beneath each compartment extend, EZRA THE SCRIBE—STOOD UPON A—PULPIT OF WOOD — WHICH HE HAD—MADE FOR THE—PREACHIN <hi>Neh— e.</hi> chap. viii. 4.</p>

<q>a cuppe of byroll, garniſhed with gold, perles, and precious ſtones, to be put in the ſacrament,</q>
and numbers of other valuable effects. He died in peace in 1447, a wonderful thing in his family; not fewer than four of this great houſe, in little more than a century, fell by violent deaths.</p>

               <p>IN our walk through <hi>Limehouſe,</hi> we croſſed the New Cut, or <hi>Poplar</hi> canal, near its diſcharge into the river. This was begun about twenty years ago; runs by <hi>Bromley,</hi> and joins the river <hi>Lea</hi> near <hi>Bow,</hi> where barges enter by means of a lock called <hi>Bow-lock.</hi> This canal is about a mile and a quarter in length; and ſerves to bring to our capital corn, malt, and flour, from the neighborhood of <hi>Hertford,</hi> and ſeveral other counties, which put their produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on board the barges at that town. It is alſo of great uſe to convey to the <hi>Thames</hi> the produce of the great diſtilleries near <hi>Bow;</hi> and alſo to the internal counties coals, and ſeveral articles from the metropolis. This canal ſaves the great circuit of paſſing down to <hi>Lea-mouth,</hi> and thence round the <hi>Iſle of Dogs;</hi> a navigation often impeded by contrary winds and tides, which frequently fall out ſo adverſe, as to occaſion great delays. Yet this canal by no means annihilates the uſe of the river <hi>Lea</hi>

to and from its mouth; but barges go indifferently either way, as conveniency, or the circumſtances above-mentioned, occur. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, many barges will enter the river <hi>Lea</hi> to ſave the navigation expences of the New Cut.</p>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0170100100:320"/>
prieſts, who not only built the bridge but kept it in repair: but it muſt be underſtood that the firſt bridge was of timber,<note place="margin">FIRST OF TIMBER.</note> the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials at hand, and moſt probably rudely put together. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is given by <hi>Stow,</hi> from the report of <hi>Bartholomew Linſted,</hi> alias <hi>Fowle,</hi> laſt prior of <hi>St. Marie Overie;</hi> but was doubted, becauſe the work has been ſuppoſed to be too great, and too diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted for a college of prieſts, who were to give up the certain profits of the ferry, for thoſe reſulting precariouſly from an expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive undertaking. Even the exiſtence of a religious houſe before the Conqueſt has been ſuſpected: but the <hi>Domeſday</hi> book puts that out of doubt, by informing us, <hi>Ipſe epiſcopus habet unum monaſterium in Sudwerche.</hi> Numbers of uſeful, as well as pious works, in early days, originated from the inſtigation of the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who often had the honor of being called the founders, when the work itſelf was performed by their devotees. Neither is it to be ſuppoſed that they could keep it in repair: the ſame zeal which impelled people to contribute to the building, operated in the veſtiture of land for its future ſupport; and this appears to have been done by ſeveral inſtances; yet the endowments were ſo ſmall, that a ſupplementary tax was often raiſed.</p>
               <p>IN 1136, the bridge was burnt down. By the year 1163 it grew ſo ruinous as to occaſion its being rebuilt, under the care of one <hi>Peter,</hi> curate of <hi>St. Mary Colechurch,</hi> a celebrated architect of thoſe times. It was ſoon after determined to build a bridge of ſtone, and, about the year 1176,<note place="margin">REBUILT IN 1176 WITH STONE.</note> the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> was employed again. It proved a work of thirty-three years: the architect died four years before it was completed; and another clergyman, <hi>Iſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> maſter of the ſchools of <hi>Xainctes,</hi> was recommended to the citizens, by king <hi>John,</hi> for the honor of finiſhing it; but they
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0170100100:321"/>
rejected their prince's choice, and committed the work to three merchants of <hi>London,</hi> who completed it in 1209. <hi>Peter</hi> was buried in a beautiful chapel, probably of his own conſtruction, dedicated to <hi>St. Thomas,</hi>

It was beautifully paved with black and white marble, and in the middle was a tomb, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to contain the remains of <hi>Peter</hi> the architect.</p>
               <p>THIS great work was founded on enormous piles, driven as cloſely as poſſible together: on their tops were laid long planks ten inches thick, ſtrongly bolted; and on them were placed the baſe of the pier, the lowermoſt ſtones of which were bedded in pitch, to prevent the water from damaging the work: round all were the piles which are called the <hi>Sterlings,</hi> deſigned for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the foundation piles. Theſe contracted the ſpace between the piers ſo greatly, as to occaſion, at the retreat of every tide, a fall of five feet, or a number of temporary cataracts, which, ſince the foundation of the bridge, have occaſioned the loſs of many thouſand lives. The water, at ſpring-tides, riſes to the height of about eighteen feet. The length of this vaſt work is nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifteen feet, the exact breadth of the river. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of arches was nineteen, of unequal dimenſions, and greatly deformed by the ſterlings, and the houſes on each ſide, which overhung and leaned in a moſt terrific manner. In moſt places they hid the arches, and nothing appeared but the rude piers. I well remember the ſtreet on <hi>London-bridge,</hi> narrow, darkſome, and dangerous to paſſengers from the multitude of carriages: frequent arches of ſtrong timber croſſed the ſtreet, from the tops of the houſes, to keep them together, and from falling into the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0170100100:322"/>
river. Nothing but uſe could preſerve the reſt of the inmates, who ſoon grew deaf to the noiſe of the falling waters, the clamors of watermen, or the frequent ſhrieks of drowning wretches. Moſt of the houſes were tenanted by pin or needle makers,<note place="margin">PIN-MAKERS.</note> and oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical ladies were wont to drive from the <hi>St. James</hi>'s end of the town, to make cheap purchaſes. <hi>Fuller</hi> tells us, that <hi>Spaniſh</hi> needles were made here firſt in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> by a negro, who died without communicating the art. <hi>Elias Crowſe,</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was more liberal, and firſt taught the method to the <hi>Engliſh. Fuller</hi>'s definition of a needle is excellent, <hi>quaſi</hi> NE IDLE.</p>
               <p>IN the bridge were three openings on each ſide, with ballu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrades, to give paſſengers a ſight of the water and ſhipping. In one part had been a draw-bridge, uſeful either by way of defence,<note place="margin">DRAW-BRIDGE.</note> or for the admiſſion of ſhips into the upper part of the river. This was protected by a ſtrong tower.

                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0170100100:328"/>SIR <hi>Chriſtopher Wren</hi> was coeval to this misfortune. The plans his great genius offered to the public for rebuilding the city, with genuine taſte, and a ſplendor worthy of ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> were unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately rejected. Perhaps the times are not greatly to be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; there were a thouſand difficulties in reſpect to the diviſion of property; there was, in a vaſt commercial city, ſuch as <hi>London,</hi> a hurry to reſume their former occupations, and a prejudice for ancient ſites. It was difficult to perſuade people to relinquiſh, for a mere work of taſte, a ſpot productive of thouſands, to them or their predeceſſors. Theſe things conſidered, it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that we are left to admire, on paper only, the vaſt deſigns of our great architect. But ſtill he was the reſtorer of ſeveral of our public buildings: many of our temples aroſe with improved beauty from his plans; and ſeveral other buildings, which we have had, or ſhall have occaſion of mentioning.</p>

found, luckily, one example to compliment the attention of the thoughtleſs monarch towards the good of his ſubjects; for, during the horrors of the conflagration, and after it was ſubdued, his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſtop the evil, and to remedy the effect, were truly indefatigable. The king was ſeriouſly affected by this calamity, and many emotions of piety and devotion were excited in him. There was, for a ſhort time, great reaſon to expect the fruits of this his brief return to Heaven: but they were quickly blaſted by the uncommon wickedneſs of the people about him, who, by every prophane witticiſm on the recent calamity, and even by ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was the bleſſing of God, to humble this rebellious city, and to prepare it for his yoke, ſoon removed every good thought from the royal breaſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Continuation of Lord <hi>Glarendon</hi>'s Life, 675.</note>. This noble column was begun in 1671; and finiſhed in 1677, at the expence of £. 14,500. A melancholy period of party rage: and the inſcription was permitted. The damage ſuſtained by the cruel element, was computed at ten mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions ſeven hundred and ſixteen thouſand pounds. But Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, mingling mercy with juſtice, ſuffered only the loſt of a very few lives.</p>
               <p>GREAT as this calamity was, yet it proved the providential cauſe of putting a ſtop to one of a far more tremendous nature. The plague, which, for a ſeries of ages, had, with very ſhort inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, viſited our capital in its moſt dreadful forms, never appeared there again after the rebuilding of the city in a more open and airy manner, which removed ſeveral nuſanoes; which, if not the actual origin of a plague, was aſſuredly one great <hi>pabulum,</hi> when

               <p>THIS hall was built on ground given by Sir <hi>John Stodie,</hi> vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, lord mayor in 1357.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0170100100:338"/>
Vintners</hi> who imported the wine, and <hi>Taverners</hi> who kept taverns, and retailed it for the former. The company flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed ſo much, that, from its inſtitution till the year 1711, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced not fewer than fourteen lord mayors, many of which were the keepers of taverns. Yet, in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> III. the <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> wines were not ſold at the rate of above 4 <hi>d.</hi> a gallon; nor the <hi>Rheniſh</hi> above 6 <hi>d.</hi> In 1379, red wine was 4 <hi>d.</hi> a gallon; and a little after, the price of a tun £. 4.

               <p>OUR great wine trade was at firſt with <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and the neighboring provinces; it commenced as early as the Conqueſt, perhaps ſooner <note n="*" place="bottom">

I think myſelf much indebted to Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor WARREN for the extraordinary hiſtory. It appears, by the annals of the college, that in the year 1674, a conſiderable ſum of money had been ſubſcribed by the fellows, for the erection of a new college, the old one having been conſumed in the great fire, eight years before. It alſo appears, that Sir <hi>John Cutler,</hi> a near relation of Doctor <hi>Whiſtler,</hi> the preſident, was deſirous of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a benefactor. A committee was appointed to wait upon Sir <hi>John,</hi> to thank him for his kind intentions. He accepted their thanks, renewed his promiſe, and ſpecified the part of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which he intended to bear the expence. In the year 1680, ſtatues in honor of the king, and Sir <hi>John,</hi> were voted by the college: and nine years afterwards, the college being then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0170100100:352"/>
it was reſolved to borrow money of Sir <hi>John Cutler,</hi> to diſcharge the college debt, but the ſum is not ſpecified. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, however, that in 1699, Sir <hi>John</hi>'s executors made a demand on the college of £. 7000; which ſum was ſuppoſed to include the money actually lent, the money pretended to be given, but ſet down as a debt in Sir <hi>John</hi>'s books, and the intereſt on both. Lord <hi>Radnor,</hi> however, and Mr. <hi>Boulter,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cutler</hi>'s exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, were prevaled on to accept £. 2000 from the college, and actually remitted the other five. So that Sir <hi>John</hi>'s promiſe, which he never performed, obtained him the ſtatue, and the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of his executors has kept it in its place ever ſince. But the college wiſely have obliterated the inſcription, which, in the warmth of its gratitude, it had placed beneath the figure.</p>

Erkenwald,</hi> the ſon of king <hi>Offa,</hi> fourth in ſucceſſion from <hi>Melitus,</hi> ornamented his cathedral very highly, and improved the revenues with his own patrimony. He was moſt deſervedly canonized; for the very litter in which he was carried in his laſt illneſs, continued many centuries to cure fevers by the touch; and the very chips, carried to the ſick, reſtored them to health.</p>
               <p>WHEN the city, of <hi>London</hi> was deſtroyed by fire, in 1086, this church was burnt; the biſhop <hi>Mauritius</hi> began to rebuild it, and laid the foundations, which remained till its ſecond deſtruction, from the ſame cauſe, in the laſt century.

The ſame monarch granted beſides, that every ſhip, which brought ſtone for the church, ſhould be exempted from toll; he gave him alſo all the great fiſh taken in his precincts, except the tongues; and laſtly, he ſecured to him and his ſucceſſor, the delicious tythes of all his veniſon in the county of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>

Conſiderable contributions were raiſed among the nobility and citizens, to ſupport ſuch preachers as were (as was often the caſe) called to town from either of the univerſities. In particular, the lord mayor and aldermen ordered that every preacher, who came from a diſtance, ſhould be freely accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, during five days, with ſweet and convenient lodgings, fire, candle, and all neceſſaries.

               <p>IT certainly at firſt was a common croſs, and coeval with the church. When it was firſt covered, and converted into a pulpit-croſs, we are not informed.

               <p>WE hear of this being in uſe as early as the year 1259. It was uſed not only for the inſtruction of mankind, by the doctrine of the preacher, but for every purpoſe political or eccleſiaſtical: for

               <p>IN 1259, <hi>Henry</hi> III. commanded the lord mayor to ſwear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aldermen, every perſon of twelve years and upwards, to be true to him and his heirs.</p>

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0170100100:377"/>
and never reſtored. This circumſtance ſhews the date of 1560, to <hi>Aggas</hi>'s famous ſurvey of <hi>London,</hi> to have been erroneous: he having given the church without the ſpire; which he never could have omitted, had it exiſted at that time.</p>
               <p>IN conſequence of the reſolutions taken in 1620, by <hi>James</hi> I. to repair the cathedral, the celebrated <hi>Inigo Jones</hi> was appointed to the work.

The great fire made way for the reſtoring of this magnificent pile by Sir CHRISTOPHER WREN, an architect worthy of ſo great a deſign. I will not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to deſcribe ſo well-known a building; the deſcription is well done in ſeveral books eaſy to be had <note n="†" place="bottom">

Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> made a model in wood of his firſt conception for rebuilding this church, in the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtyle. He had in it an eye to the loſs of the <hi>Pulpit-croſs,</hi> and had ſupplied its place by a magnificent auditory within, for the reception of a large congregation. This was approved by men of excellent judgment, but laid aſide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion it had not ſufficiently a temple-like form. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was made, ſelected out of various ſketches he had drawn; on this deſign Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> ſet a high value: but this alſo was

                     <hi>Parentalia,</hi> 282.</note>. The third, which produced the preſent noble pile, was approved and executed. A ſingular accident happened at the beginning: while the great architect was ſetting out the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the dome, he ordered a common laborer to bring him a flat ſtone, to be laid as a direction to the maſons; he brought a fragment of a graveſtone, on which was the word RESURGAM. This was not loſt on <hi>Sir Chriſtopher;</hi> he caught the idea of the Phoenix, which he placed on the ſouth <hi>Portico,</hi> with that word cut beneath.</p>
               <p>THE firſt ſtone was laid on <hi>June</hi> 21, 1675; and the building was completed by him in 1710 <note n="†" place="bottom">The ſame, 292.</note>; but the whole decorations were not finiſhed till 1723 <note n="‡" place="bottom">

It is not, as often miſtaken, built after the model of that famous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: it is the entire conception of our great countryman; and has been preferred in ſome reſpects, by a judicious writer, to even the <hi>Roman Baſilica.</hi> Its dimenſions are leſs. The compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive view is given in the <hi>Parentalia,</hi> and copied in <hi>London and its Environs.</hi>—I will only mention the great outlines:—the height of <hi>St. Peter's,</hi> to the top of the croſs, is four hundred and thirty-ſeven feet and a half; that of <hi>St. Paul's,</hi> three hundred and forty feet: ſo that, from its ſituation, it is lofty enough to be ſeen
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0170100100:379"/>
from the ſea. The length of the firſt, is ſeven hundred and twenty-nine feet; of the latter, five hundred. The greateſt breadth of St. <hi>Peter's</hi> is three hundred and ſixty-four; of St. <hi>Paul's,</hi> one hundred and eighty.</p>

               <p>IN digging the foundation for the rebuilding of this cathedral, it was diſcovered, beneath the graves mentioned at p. 9, that the foundation of the old church reſted on a layer of hard and cloſe pot earth. Curioſity led Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wren</hi> to ſearch farther. He found that on the north ſide it was ſix feet thick, that it grew thinner towards the ſouth, and on the decline of the hill was
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0170100100:382"/>
ſcarcely four. On advancing farther, he met with nothing but looſe ſand; at length he came to water and ſand mixed with periwinkles, and other ſea-ſhells; and, by boring, came at laſt to the beach, and under that the natural hard clay: which evinced that the ſea had once occupied the ſpace on which St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s now ſtands. This ſand had been one of thoſe ſand-hills frequent on many coaſts, not only on thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> but on our own.

In the court-room is a fine portrait of Sir <hi>Hugh Myddelton,</hi> with a ſhell by him, out of which he may be ſuppoſed to have poured the uſeful element to the thirſting metropolis. The words <hi>Fontes Fodinae</hi> are painted on the picture, to imply his double attentions. The wealth he got in the mines was totally exhauſted in the execution of his project, of which the metropolis, to this moment, receives increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benefit. Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> left a ſhare in the New River to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for the benefit of the decayed members; which, <hi>even</hi> in 1704, amounted to £. 134.</p>
               <p>HERE is a good portrait of Sir <hi>Martin Bowes,</hi> lord mayor in 1545, with his chain and robes of office. The date of his picture is 1566.</p>

The unfortunate devil is not forgotten, roaring between the pincers of the ſaint; with the heavenly hoſt above, applauding the deed. It ſeems by this that St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi> amuſed himſelf in works of gold as well as iron: ſo that it is no wonder to ſee the evil ſpirit in a place where the <hi>irritamenta malorum</hi> ſo much abound.</p>
               <p>QUEEN <hi>Elizabeth</hi> preſented this company with a ſilver cup, out of which annual libations are made to her memory. She was particularly kind to the citizens, and borrowed money of them on all occaſions. The goldſmiths muſt of courſe enjoy a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed place in her eſteem.</p>
               <p>THIS company appeared as a fraternity as early as 1180, being then amerced for being <hi>adulterine,</hi> or for ſetting up without the king's licence. In the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III. they obtained a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and were incorporated for the ſum of ten marks. <hi>Richard</hi> II. confirmed the ſame, in conſideration of the ſum of twenty marks. They increaſed in wealth, and have left evident marks of charity, by having above a thouſand pounds a year to diſpoſe of for bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent purpoſes. They became in time the bankers of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. The <hi>Lombards</hi> were the firſt and the greateſt, and moſt of the money contracts in old times paſſed through their hands. Many of our monarchs were obliged to them for money. They did not ſeem to like truſting <hi>Henry</hi> IV. on his bond, ſo took the cuſtoms in pawn for their loan.</p>
               <p>THE buſineſs of goldſmiths was confined to the buying and ſelling of plate, and foreign coins of gold and ſilver, melting them, and coining others at the mint. The banking was accidental, and foreign to their inſtitution.</p>

                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:0170100100:387"/>REGULAR banking by private people reſulted, in 1643, from the calamity of the time, when the ſeditious ſpirit was incited by the arts of the parlementary leaders. The merchants and tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who before truſted their caſh to their ſervants and appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, found that no longer ſafe; neither did they dare to leave it in the mint at the Tower, by reaſon of the diſtreſſes of majeſty itſelf, which before was a place of public depoſit. In the year 1645, they began to place it in the hands of goldſmiths, when they firſt began publicly to exerciſe both profeſſions. Even in my days were ſeveral very eminent bankers, who kept the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths ſhop: but they were more frequently ſeparated. The firſt regular banker was Mr. <hi>Francis Child,</hi> goldſmith, who began buſineſs ſoon after the Reſtoration. He was the father of the profeſſion, a perſon of large fortune and moſt reſpectable character. He married, between the years 1665 and 1675, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> only daughter of <hi>Robert Blanchard,</hi> citizen and goldſmith, by whom he had twelve children. Mr. <hi>Child</hi> was afterwards knighted. He lived in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> where the ſhop ſtill continues <note n="*" place="bottom">For theſe particulars I am obliged to the civility of Mr. <hi>Dent,</hi> partner in this great ſhop.</note>, in a ſtate of the higheſt reſpectability. Mr. <hi>Granger</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. iii. 410.</note> mentions Mr. <hi>Child</hi> as ſucceſſor to the ſhop of alderman <hi>Backwel,</hi> a banker in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> II. noted for his integrity, abilities, and induſtry; who was ruined by the ſhutting up of the exchequer in 1672. His books were placed in the hands of Mr. <hi>Child,</hi> and ſtill remain in the family.</p>
               <p>THE next antient ſhop was that poſſeſſed at preſent by Meſſrs. <hi>Snow</hi> and <hi>Denne,</hi> a few doors to the weſt of Mr. <hi>Child</hi>'s; who

               <p>IN <hi>Laurence-lane,</hi> not far from hence, was another public-houſe of much antiquity, and which is ſtill in great buſineſs as a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers inn; the <hi>Bloſſoms Inn,</hi> ſo named from the rich border of flowers which adorned the original ſign, that of St. <hi>Laurence.</hi> Theſe were the effects of his martyrdom, "for (ſays the legend) flowers ſprung up on the ſpot of his cruel martyrdom."</p>
               <p>IN this ſtreet, between the croſs and <hi>Sopers-lane,</hi> were held moſt ſplendid tournaments in the year 1331; they began <hi>Sept.</hi> 21, and laſted three days. A ſcaffold was erected for queen <hi>Philippa</hi> and her gay troop of ladies, all moſt richly attired, to behold the knights collected from all quarters to ſhew their ſkill in deeds of arms. The upper part of the ſcaffold, on which the ladies were ſeated, "brake in ſunder, and," as <hi>Stow</hi> ſays,
<q>whereby they were (with ſome ſhame) forced to fall downe;</q>
and many knights and others, which ſtood beneath, much hurt. The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters were ſaved from puniſhment, by the interceſſion of the

queen; but, to prevent ſuch accidents in future, the king ordered a building of ſtone to be erected, near the church of St. <hi>Mary le Bow,</hi> for himſelf, the queen, and "other ſtates," to ſee the gallant ſpectacles in ſafety <note n="*" place="bottom">Stow's Survaie, <hi>485.</hi>

On ſome very feſtive occaſions theſe conduits have been made to run with claret.

both of proviſions and liveries: but I ſuſpect, as it leſſened the honor of the city, it was not long obſerved; for in 1554, the city thought proper to renew the order of council, by way of reminding their fellow-citizens of their relapſe into luxury. Among the great feaſts given here on public occaſions, may be reckoned that given in 1612, on occaſion of the unhappy marriage of the prince <hi>Palatine</hi> with <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> daughter of <hi>James</hi> I; who, in defiance of the remonſtrances of his better-judging father-in-law, ruſhed on the uſurpation of the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of another monarch, and brought great miſery on himſelf and his amiable ſpouſe.

               <p>THESE <hi>Sotelties,</hi> or Subtilities as they were called, were the ornamental part of the deſert, and were extremely different from thoſe in preſent uſe. In the inthronization feaſt of archbiſhop <hi>Wareham,</hi> on <hi>March</hi> 9th, 1504, the firſt courſe was preceded by
<q>a <hi>warner</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">A <hi>warner</hi> was the firſt ſoteltie, and which preceded or gave warning of the courſes. See <hi>Leland's Collect.</hi> vi. 21.</note>, conveyed upon a rounde boorde of viii panes, with viii towres embatteled and made with flowres, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge on every towre a bedil in his habite, with his ſtaffe: and in the ſame boorde, firſt the king ſyttinge in his parliament, with his lordes about hym in their robes; and Saint <hi>Wylliam,</hi> lyke an archiſhop, ſytting on the ryght hand of the kyng: then the chaunceler of <hi>Oxforde,</hi> with other doctors about hym, preſented the ſaid lord <hi>Wylliam,</hi> kneelyng, in a doctor's habite, unto the kyng, with his commend of vertue and cunnynge, &amp;c. &amp;c. And on the third boorde of the ſame warner, the Holy Ghoſte appeared with bryght beames proceedyng from hym of the gyftes of grace towarde the ſayde lorde of the feaſte.</q>
This is a ſpecimen of the antient ſotelties. This was a <hi>Lenten</hi> feaſt of the moſt luxurious kind. Many of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telties were ſuited to the occaſion, and of the legendary nature; others hiſtorical; but all, without doubt, contrived "with great cunnynge."</p>
               <p>TO theſe ſcenes of luxury and gluttony, let me oppoſe the ſimple fare at a feaſt of the <hi>Wax-chandlers,</hi> on <hi>Oct.</hi> 28th, 1478. Theſe were a flouriſhing company in the days of old, when gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

to ſaints called ſo frequently for lights. How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of wax candles were conſumed on thoſe occaſions, and what quantities the expiatory offerings of private perſons, none can enumerate. <hi>Candle-maſs</hi> day waſted its thouſands, and thoſe all bleſſed by the prieſts, and adjured in ſolemn terms.

               <p>THIS company is the firſt of the twelve, or ſuch who are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with the privilege of the lord mayor's being elected out of one of them.

But, as numbers of this opulent company were merchants, and imported great quantities of rich ſilks from <hi>Italy,</hi> the name became applied to the company, and all deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in ſilk. Several of the portraits in the great room of this hall are of <hi>Italian</hi> merchants. Not fewer than ſixty-two mayors were of this company, between the years 1214 and 1762; among which it reckons Sir <hi>John Coventry,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Whittington,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard</hi> and Sir <hi>John Greſham.</hi> We are obliged to the exact <hi>Strype</hi> for the liſt.

But we are more aſtoniſhed when we find that this expenſive princely pile was the effect of the munificence of a private citizen, SIR THOMAS GRESHAM. Let the pride of my country not be ſuppreſſed, when I have opportunity of ſaying, that the original hint was given to him by a <hi>Welſhman;</hi> by <hi>Richard Clough,</hi> afterwards knighted, originally his ſervant, and in the year 1561, by his merit and induſtry, advanced by Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> to be his correſpondent and agent in the then emporium of the world,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0170100100:417"/>
                  <hi>Antwerp. Clough</hi> wrote to his maſter, to blame the city of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for neglecting ſo neceſſary a thing; bluntly telling, that they ſtudied nothing elſe but their own private profit; that they were content to walk about in the rain, more like pedlars than mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; and that there was no kind of people but had their place to tranſact buſineſs in, in other countries. Thus ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> purchaſed ſome tenements on the ſite of the Royal Exchange; and, on <hi>June</hi> 7, 1566, laid the foundation, and in <hi>November,</hi> 1567, completed what was then called the <hi>Bourſe.</hi> In 1570, queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> went in great ſtate from her palace at <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> to make Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> a viſit at his own houſe. After dinner ſhe went to the Bourſe, viſited every part, and then, by ſound of trumpet, dignified it with the title of the <hi>Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</hi> All the upper part was filled then, and even to this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, with ſhops; on this occaſion they were filled with the richeſt productions of the univerſe, to ſhew her majeſty the proſperity of the commercial parts of her dominions. I cannot learn what the expence of this noble deſign was, only that the annual product of the rents to his widow was £. 751. 5 <hi>s.</hi> I am equally unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the form of the original building, which periſhed in the great fire.

It was completed in 1669; on <hi>Sept.</hi> 28, of that year, it was opened by the lord mayor, Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Turner,</hi> who congratulated the merchants on the occaſion.

               <p>IT was one of this meek profeſſion, actuated by the religion of meekneſs, who firſt ſuggeſted the pious project of aboliſhing the ſlave trade. <hi>Thomas Woolman,</hi> a quaker, and taylor, of <hi>New Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> was firſt ſtruck with the thought, that engaging in the traffic of the human ſpecies was incompatible with the ſpirit of the Chriſtian religion. He publiſhed many tracts againſt this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſpecies of commerce: he argued againſt it in public and private: he made long journies for the ſake of talking to indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals on the ſubject; and was careful, himſelf, not to countenance ſlavery, by the uſe of thoſe conveniences which were provided by the labor of ſlaves.

This houſe was the place where the profeſſors
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0170100100:438"/>
had their apartments, and where the lectures were to be read; which were begun in 1597, but they are now quite deſerted. This aroſe in a great degree from the inſtitution of the ROYAL SOCIETY: the meetings of which were for a conſiderable time held here.</p>
               <p>THE origin of that reſpectable body was from the meeting of a few illuſtrious perſons at the lodgings of doctor <hi>Wilkins,</hi>

In 1658, they aſſembled in <hi>Greſham</hi> college, by permiſſion of the profeſſors of the foundation of Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham;</hi> and on the Reſtoration were incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by royal charter.

Doctor <hi>Nehemiah Grew</hi> not only performed that part, but illuſtrated every one, in caſes where the ſubject admitted, with the moſt learned and pertinent remarks. He publiſhed his <hi>Muſeum Regalis Societatis</hi> in 1681, and dedicated it to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Mr. <hi>Colwall,</hi> at the expence of whom the plates were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven. It is a work equal to the <hi>Muſeum Wormianum,</hi> and any other admired foreign performance of that age. Its defects ariſe only from the want of ſyſtem, the misfortune of the time; for our RAY had not then cleared the rich ore of Natural Hiſtory from the ſurrounding rubbiſh. About the year 1711, the Society re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from hence to <hi>Crane-court</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet.</hi> For numbers of years the <hi>Muſeum</hi> was neglected.

By ſingular chance, <hi>Greſham</hi> college eſcaped the flames in 1666; but I believe very little of the original houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains: it having been moſtly rebuilt in 1601, poſſibly after the original deſign; the arcades being adapted for the reception of the numbers of commercial and other followers of ſo univerſal a merchant as Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham.</hi>

               <p>I DO not recollect that it flows in any part over a rocky channel; its bottom is either gravelly or clayey, according to the nature of the ſoil through which it meanders.
