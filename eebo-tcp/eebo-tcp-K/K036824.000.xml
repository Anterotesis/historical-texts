            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Inclination you have expreſſed, to hear what might be ſaid, in Behalf of thoſe moſt numerous Productions of our Preſs, which we diſtinguiſh by the Name of PAMPHLETS; and the preſent <hi>Undertaking,</hi> by the Compiler of <hi>PHOENIX BRITANNICUS,</hi> to Revive the moſt Excellent among them; has induced me thus briefly, to touch upon thoſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which ſeemed moſt to attract your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s Inquiry; hoping the Readineſs of my Endeavour will atone for the Imperfections of my Performance; which, if it does not <hi>equal</hi> the Extenſions of your Curioſity, may <hi>add</hi> to the Inſtances of your Candour: So that, where you find not Entertainment commenſurate to your <hi>Knowledge,</hi> you will not fail of Exerciſe correſpondent to your <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, Firſt, for the <hi>Derivation</hi> of the Word <hi>Pamphlet:</hi> I ſhould think it little diſcredited by what ſome <hi>Etymologiſts,</hi> and thoſe who torture Words into Confeſſions of what they were never guilty, have, thro' the Confinement of themſelves to ſome opprobrious Signification, cenſoriouſly ſuggeſted thereof. Thus one Linguiſt, having found a Word which will illuſtrate the Adaptneſs of theſe Writings to the vulgar Conſultation of the Populace, would derive it from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which, by a Grammatical Turn, reaches to the Analogy of <hi>Sound,</hi> and, by a Rhetorical Twiſt, to the plauſible Senſe of <hi>inflaming all</hi> Parties. But others, conſidering the Subject of <hi>Pamphlets</hi> in a more copious and unbiaſſed Latitude, as having branched into all other Parts of Science, beſides <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Politics,</hi> from the firſt Appropriation of the Name, and before their Engagement in Controverſy could draw upon them any prevailing <hi>Sobriquet</hi> to their Diſparagement, have, with leſs Partiality, concluded of theſe Tracts, whoſe Contents, therefore, as well as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0131401400:3"/>
are ſo generally engaging to all Writers and Readers, ſo much more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſuited to every Body's Peruſal, to every Body's Purchaſe, that the Name is more properly derivable from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as if they were a Kind of Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>beloved by,</hi> or <hi>delighting all</hi> People<note n="*" place="bottom">Icon Libellorum in Pref.</note>. But, notwithſtanding this favourable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation, I ſhould not be for going to <hi>Athens</hi> after one, or ſeeking it in any other of the more ancient Languages, ſeeing <hi>that</hi> Word <hi>Pampier,</hi> for <hi>Paper,</hi> in one more Modern, more probable to me (as it ſeemed before, to one of our moſt induſtrious <hi>Gloſſographers)</hi> for <hi>this</hi> of <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> to be derived from <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Skinneri</hi> Etymologicon Ling. Ang. <hi>Fol. 1671.</hi>
               </note>; the laſt Letter of the firſt Syllable being interwoven by <hi>Epentheſis,</hi> to mollify the Sound; and the laſt Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubſtituted, as a noted Term of Diminution in many Languages<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ib. in Voc. <hi>Let.</hi> &amp; Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman</hi>'s Gloſſ.</note>; with the ſame Difference of Interpretation, as between <hi>Charta</hi> and <hi>Chartula,</hi> or <hi>Papyrus</hi> and <hi>Papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulus:</hi> Thus, alſo, in <hi>French,</hi> the Diminutive of the Word <hi>Livre,</hi> for a Book itſelf, is <hi>Livret</hi>; and thus, in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> we have <hi>Aglet, Amulet, Bracelet, Chaplet, Corſlet, Eaglet, Gafflet, Hamlet, Howlet, Oilet, Pallet, Pullet, Ringlet, Rivulet,</hi> and Twenty more, with like Terminations to the ſame Senſe. Now, this Extraction, beſides the Plea of Precedent, has the farther Recommendations to our Preference, of not ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating the Familiarity of <hi>Graeciſms</hi> in our Tongue, and withal of deriving itſelf from the more apparent, and determinable Quality, of the Size or Subſtance, rather than the Subject Matter, of theſe more exiguous Compoſitions. And thus the Word <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,</hi> or <hi>little Paper</hi> Book, imports no reproachful Character, any more than the Word <hi>Great</hi> Book; ſignifies a Paſquil, as little as it does a Panegyric, of itſelf: Is neither Good nor Bad, Learned nor Illiterate, True nor Falſe, Serious nor Jocular, of its own naked Meaning, or Conſtruction; but is either of them, according as the Subject makes the Diſtinction. Thus, of ſcurrilous and abuſive <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> to be burned in 1647, we read in <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>; and, by the Name of <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> is the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium</hi> of Queen <hi>Emma</hi> called in <hi>Hollinſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> it is not only queſtionable, whether the Art of <hi>Printing</hi> ſhould ſet a Bound to it, but even the very Adoption of the Name itſelf; which yet I take to be more Modern than that Art: For I look upon them as the eldeſt Offspring of Paper, and to claim the Rights of <hi>Primogeniture</hi> even of Bound Volumes, however they may be ſhorter-liv'd, and the Younger Brother has ſo much out-grown the Elder; in-as-much as Arguments do now, and more eſpecially did, in the Minority of our Erudition, not only ſo much more rarely require a larger Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs than Pamphlets will compriſe; but theſe being of a more ready and facil, more decent and ſimple Form, ſuitable to the Character of the more Artleſs Ages, they ſeem to have been preferred by our modeſt Anceſtry for the Communication of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, before Book-Writing became a <hi>Trade</hi>; and Lucre, or Vanity let in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luges of Digreſſory Learning, to ſwell up unweildy <hi>Folio's.</hi> Thus I find, not a a little to the Honour of our Subject, no leſs a Perſon than the Renowned King <hi>AELFRED,</hi> collecting his Sage Precepts, and Divine Sentences, with his own Royal Hand, into <hi>Quaternions of Leaves ſtitched together</hi>

            <p>It is ſo difficult to recover even any of our firſt Books, or <hi>Volumes,</hi> which were Printed by <hi>William Caxton,</hi> though it is certain he ſet forth near Half a Hundred of them in <hi>Folio,</hi> that it were a Wonder if his <hi>Pamphlets</hi> ſhould not be quite loſt.

There are more extant of his Succeſſor <hi>Wynkin de Worde</hi>'s Printing in this leſſer Form, whereof, as great Rarities, I have ſeen both in <hi>Quarto</hi> and <hi>Octavo,</hi> tho' holding no Compariſon, probably, with thoſe of his alſo, which are deſtroyed. But it was the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Grand Controverſy between the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the firſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers thereof, which ſeems to have laid the great Foundation of this Kind of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to have given great Credit to it at the ſame Time, as well by the many eminent Authors it produced in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> as the ſucceſsful Detection and Defeat, thereby befalling thoſe religious Impoſtures, which had ſo univerſally inſlaved the Minds of Men. Nay, this important Reformation, has been much aſcribed to one little Pamphlet only, which a certain Lawyer of <hi>Grey</hi>'s-Inn, obliged to fly into <hi>Germany</hi> (for having acted in a <hi>Play</hi> which incenſed Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi>) compoſed there, and conveyed by Means of the Lady <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> to the Peruſal of King <hi>Henry,</hi> at the Beginning of the ſaid Rupture<note n="*" place="bottom">

More</hi>'s Supplication of Souls.</note>; how, glaringly it was fix'd in the very Front of prohibited Books; and, yet, how it cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated the ſaid King's Eſteem and Affection: may be not only preſumed from the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but gathered from the Accounts which our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Hiſtorians have given thereof <note n="‖‖" place="bottom">See <hi>Fox</hi>'s Martyr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Reformat. <hi>Vol. 1.</hi>
               </note>.

Had <hi>Phoenix Britannicus</hi> been alive a <hi>Century</hi> paſt, or half a one ſooner, we might have had a better <hi>Knowledge</hi> of that vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Pamphlets, which <hi>Montaigne</hi> mentions <note n="§" place="bottom">Eſſaye ſur la Defenſe de <hi>Seneque,</hi> et de <hi>Plutarque.</hi>
               </note>, and whereof he intimates many to have been ſo ingeniouſly written, on the aforeſaid Controverſy of the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> than it is now poſſible we ſhall ever arrive at even the <hi>Names</hi> of.</p>
            <p>But, as <hi>England,</hi> thro' its Spirit of Liberty, has been the moſt fruitful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for the Production of Pamphlets, ſo the Period which has been moſt fruitful in them, was that of our <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. And, indeed, in all Diſorders, or Commotions, it is natural to have Recourſe to the moſt expeditious Intelligence and Redreſs, leſt the Delay ſhould be more dangerous than the Deficiency of them; or they, ſuperannuated before they are born. For, while ſome Perſons are labouring in the <hi>Paroxyſms</hi> of Contention, were others to be pondering long-winded Expedients of Accommodation, and preſcribe a Volume for a <hi>Recipe,</hi> the Doſe would come too late for the Diſeaſe, and the very Preparation thereof diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able its Efficacy. Therefore are Pamphlets, and ſuch ſhort Tracts, riſeſt in great Revolutions; which tho' looked upon, by ſome, but as <hi>Paper Lanterns,</hi> ſet a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be gaped at by the Multitude (in illuminating whom, they have not always eſcaped the Flames themſelves) yet are they beheld, by politic, or penetrating Eyes,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0131401400:5"/>
as the <hi>Thermometers</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> fore-ſhewing the Temperature and Changes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the <hi>Calentures</hi> approaching therein, and even Preſervatives to be had againſt them, would the <hi>Active</hi> be as unanimous to prevent, as the <hi>Speculative</hi> have been induſtrious to prognoſticate the ſame. Tho' there may not remain as eminent Proofs among the Pamphleteers in the aforeſaid <hi>Anarchy,</hi> of an Ambition to Unanimity, as there are to Diſſention: For, ſurely, no Nation, has ever given more conſpicuous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to what immeaſurable Lengths, Animoſity, and Indignation will advance, upon the leaſt Impoſition, or even Umbrage of Tyrannical or Arbitrary Power; as might be exemplified, among many others, in the reſtleſs <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> and the endleſs <hi>William Prynne,</hi> who had both been bleeding Witneſſes thereof. There are near a Hundred Pamphlets, written by, and concerning the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe Authors: But the Labours of the <hi>laſt</hi> being unparallel'd, I may here not improperly obſerve, that during the <hi>Forty-two</hi> Years he was a Writer, he publiſhed above a <hi>Hundred</hi> and <hi>Sixty</hi> Pamphlets, beſides ſeveral thick Bound Volumes in <hi>Quarto</hi> and <hi>Folio,</hi> all ſaid to be gathered into about <hi>Forty</hi> Tomes, and extant in <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s-Inn Library.

Year 1640, to the Beginning of 1660, it appears, there were publiſhed, in that Space, near <hi>Thirty Thouſand</hi> ſeveral Tracts, and that theſe were not the compleat Iſſue of that Period, there is good Preſumption, and, I believe, Proofs in Being: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it is enriched with near a Hundred Manuſcripts, which no Body then (being written on the Side of the <hi>Royaliſts</hi>) would venture to put in Print; the Whole, however, for it is yet undiſperſed, is progreſſionally and uniformly Bound, in upwards of <hi>Two Thouſand Volumes,</hi> of all Sizes.

               </note>, wherein every Piece has ſuch a punctual Regiſter and Reference, that the ſmalleſt, even of a ſingle Leaf, may be readily repaired to thereby. They were collected, no doubt, with great Aſſiduity and Expence, and not preſerved, in thoſe troubleſome Times, without great Danger and Difficulty; the Books being often ſhifted from Place to Place, out of the Army's Reach. And ſo ſcarce were many of theſe Tracts, even at their firſt Publication, that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt is reported to have given Ten Pounds for only reading one of them over, which he could no where elſe procure, at the Owner's Houſe, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-Yard<note n="†" place="bottom">Ib.</note>. And yet this <hi>Collection,</hi> will, perhaps, not now produce the Tenth, and, ſome think, not the Twentieth Part of the <hi>Four Thouſand Pounds</hi> which he is ſaid to have refuſed for it. Whatever is the Reaſon, that they may ſeem to be thus depreciated, I preſume not to diſtinguiſh, perceiving ſo many Reaſons offering themſelves to our Choice for the ſame: As, Whether it lies not in the <hi>Way</hi> of the preſent Poſſeſſor, to make the beſt Uſe or Advantage of them: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abundance of extraneous Volumes, or more extended Treatiſes, publiſhed in that <hi>Interſtice,</hi> upon Subjects foreign to a Collection of <hi>Occaſional</hi> Pamphlets, Hiſtorical and Political, interfere not to make up the Number: Particularly, Whether it is not ſurcharged with the canting Divinity of <hi>thoſe</hi> Times, which may be thought too crude, lean, and dull for the Edification of <hi>theſe</hi>: But more particularly, Whether thoſe who would be Purchaſers, having, doubtleſs, ſome Knowledge of Pamphlets, the Uſe which has been, and what remains to be made by Hiſtorical Writers, of them, do not apprehend, that ſo many copious Collectors, general and ſpecial, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with that important Period, have already ſufficiently gleaned, and diſplayed whatever is Material among theſe more compendious Aſſiſtances. For ſo it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> the moſt voluminous of them all, did, moſt plentifully, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf from theſe Fountains, how abundantly ſoever he repreſents the Facts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in corrupted with Fiction: How fondly ſoever he ſeems to magnify his own Sagacity, in the diſtinguiſhment of one from the other; and how ſuſpiciouſly ſoever he diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances all farther Examination into them, than that wherewith he has been pleaſed to preſent us; where he expreſſes himſelf thus ſlightingly of theſe very Authorities, which have yet ſo liberally contributed to ſuch of the maſſy <hi>Tomes,</hi> paſſing under his Name, whereof he was the real Compiler. <q>

            <p>Otherwiſe, excepting thoſe more partial, and precipitous Products of this Kind, wherewith that Age was ſo much glutted, there never was a greater Eſteem, or a better Market; never ſo many eager Searchers after, or extravagant Purchaſers of ſcarce Pamphlets, than in theſe preſent Times, as might be made evident, either from the Sales of them in general; as that of <hi>Tom Britton,</hi> the celebrated <hi>Small-coal-Man</hi> of <hi>Clarkenwell,</hi> who, beſides his <hi>Chymical</hi> and <hi>Muſical Collections,</hi> had one of <hi>Choice Pamphlets,</hi> which, as I have heard, he ſold to the late Lord <hi>Somers,</hi> for upwards of Five Hundred Pounds. And, more eſpecially, that of Mr. <hi>Anthony Collins,</hi> the laſt Year, whoſe Library, conſiſting chiefly of <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> and thoſe moſtly <hi>Controverſial,</hi> moſtly <hi>Modern,</hi> yet is reported to have been ſold, both Parts of it, for above <hi>Eighteen Hundred Pounds:</hi> Incouragement ſufficient to make the Catalogues of other like <hi>Auctions</hi> as expreſſive, and diſtinct as theſe are. Or, whether we deſcend into Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and conſider the exorbitant Value ſet upon, and Profits which have been made out of ſome ſingle Pieces: As the <hi>Topographical</hi> Pamphlets of <hi>John Norden,</hi> the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>; which, before they were re-printed often ſold for <hi>Forty Shillings</hi> a-piece. And ſome of <hi>Bale</hi>'s Tracts; as that of <hi>Anne Askew:</hi> More eſpecially, the <hi>Examination</hi> of Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle,</hi> which I have known to ſell for <hi>Three Guineas,</hi> though gleaned by <hi>Fox</hi> into his <hi>Book of Martyrs.</hi> The <hi>Expedition</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> alſo, has been ſold for <hi>Four Guineas,</hi> though totally inſerted in <hi>Hollinſhed.</hi> Theſe, and ſome other perſonal Narratives, I could Name, are as notorious as the Advancement of <hi>Jordano Bruno</hi>'s little Book, called, <hi>Spaccio della Beſtia Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umfonte,</hi> to near <hi>Thirty Pounds,</hi> at the <hi>Auction</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Books, Serjeant-Surgeon to her late Majeſty: Or of the uncaſtrated <hi>Holinſhead,</hi> to near <hi>Forty-five Pounds,</hi> ſome Years after. Though, when the former came to be known in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it would ſometimes paſs off for ſo many <hi>Pence</hi>; and the Deficiencies of the Latter, to be ſupplied out of Auditor <hi>Jett</hi>'s Library, it would not always riſe to ſo many <hi>Shillings,</hi> that is to ſay, above its ordinary Eſtimation. Plainly demonſtrating, <hi>that</hi> unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Value aroſe not from any rich Mines of Knowledge, which the ſcarce Part would communicate, from nothing intrinſically Curious, or Inſtructive in it; nor even any material Uſe to be made of it; but merely from the empty Property of its Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, and being, as the contending Purchaſers fondly apprehended, no where elſe recoverable.</p>
            <p>Several other Tracts, beſides thoſe before ſpecified, I could mention, which the Retailers of them have prized at their Weight in Gold, and for which, more Pounds have been exacted, than, probably, they ever yielded Pence, at their firſt Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But I refrain being too Particular, leſt I ſhould, too inadvertently, give Handles for Extortion on one Side, or too diſtinctly expoſe this Dotage of Curioſity on the other; nevertheleſs, I may hereupon ſeaſonably obſerve, and the rather, becauſe I have had Your LORDSHIP's Noble Concurrence, that this <hi>Caco-zealous</hi> Curioſity it is; which has, of late, been deemed ſo obſtructive to the Advancement of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in a Set of reputed <hi>Literati,</hi> who make no more Uſe of the Books they are beſet with in their Studies, than <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> of the Beauties which inviron them in the <hi>Seraglio</hi>; yet can never reſt till they have gathered themſelves <hi>Libraries</hi> to doze in; like Children, who will not be quiet without <hi>Lights</hi> to <hi>ſleep</hi> by. But thoſe, who are thus diſeaſed, would do well to conſider, while they monopolize ſuch Collections as would extenſively benefit the Republic of Letters, and bury them in the narrow Circuit of their own private, and unconſequentional Poſſeſſion, only becauſe they have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0131401400:8"/>
               <hi>great</hi> Fortunes which will impower them to do it, how detrimental they may be to induſtrious and ingenious Scholars, of <hi>ſmall</hi> ones, who really want them for public and important Uſes; while the mercenary Saleſmen, making no Diſtinction, but a general Rule of Valuation, from the particular Payments of one prodigal Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer, is incouraged to part with nothing to any Body elſe, at the intrinſic, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Value: Whereas, if there were no extravagant <hi>Buyers</hi> of Books, there would be no extortionate <hi>Sellers</hi> of them. And if due Uſe were allowed to be made of all that are uſeful, there would be no ſuch ſhameful Scarcity among them. Such Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, would, therefore, do well, I ſay again, to conſider, that <hi>Curmudgeons</hi> among <hi>Books,</hi> are as diſcoverable as thoſe among <hi>Bags</hi>; and that they may loſe more Honour and Credit, than gain Wiſdom or Happineſs, by the fruitleſs Amaſſment and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of <hi>either.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The extraordinary Price of Pamphlets aforeſaid, would naturally excite our more deliberate Enquiry into what has been moſt extraordinary in the Contents of them; but ſo multifarious are the Subjects they comprehend, that it cannot be expected I ſhould even enumerate the ſame, in the narrow Limits of this <hi>Epiſtolary Addreſs.</hi> What do moſt attract the Attention of Mankind, are thoſe dreaded Scourges of Male-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, commonly, tho' perhaps, ſometimes too indiſcriminately, bearing the contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious Denomination of <hi>Libels.</hi> It matters little whether it appears to me Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or not, that ſuch Writings, as duly expoſe Villany, ſhould themſelves be held vile; or that ſome Perſons, who have been unjuſtly Injurious, by any other Means, may not be juſtly injured by this: But it is obvious to all, who know the Diſproportion of Riches and Power in the World, that there are Crimes not to be blaſted, and Criminals not to be branded by any other Means. And, ſince the Laſhes of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> will reach where thoſe of <hi>Juſtice</hi> cannot; ſince <hi>Truth</hi> will project <hi>Defamation</hi> from the Actions of oppreſſive Rulers, as uncontrouledly as the <hi>Sun</hi> does <hi>Shadows</hi> from <hi>opacous Bodies,</hi> the Redreſs of the Effect is to be ſought for in the Cauſe: And we ſhould apply the <hi>Salve</hi> to the <hi>Minds</hi> which received the Provocation, not <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peric</hi>-like, ſeek to ſtanch them, by <hi>binding up</hi> the <hi>Weapons</hi> which returned it.

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0131401400:10"/>Thus much for the Topics and Arguments ariſing from thoſe Examples and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, which have occurred, as moſt obſervable, upon this ſudden Recollection, to illuſtrate my <hi>preſent Subject.</hi> What remains to be ſaid of <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> will more eſpecially regard the <hi>preſent Undertaking,</hi> to make a ſelect Revival of them. The Approbation whereof may be grounded on theſe Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Regard we owe to the Preſervation of Good Writings in general, and to their Separation from the Bad: But more in particular to theſe. For, if the Re-printing of good old <hi>Books</hi> is commendable, much more is that of good old <hi>Pamphlets</hi>; they being, not to mention the greater Eaſe of the Expence, really more in Want of ſuch Juſtice, to remove that mean Opinion which ſome, unread therein, have more indiſtinctly entertained of them <hi>all,</hi> becauſe <hi>many</hi> indeed are but meanly written; tho' the Proportion is not greater than in Books: And for thoſe Pamphlets which really are <hi>well</hi> written (as abundance ſufficient for any ſuch Undertaking have been, by the ableſt Pens, upon the moſt emergent Points, however they daily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the common Wreck, for Want of a helping Hand) they cannot be denied a juſt Claim to this Care.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi>; Becauſe they ſtand in greater Need of ſuch Care, than Writings better ſecured by their Bulk and Bindings do. Many good old Family-Books are deſcended to us, whoſe Backs and Sides our careful Grand-ſires Buff'd, and Boſs'd, and Board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Teeth of Time, or more devouring Ignorance, and whoſe Leaves they guarded with <hi>Braſs,</hi> nay, <hi>Silver</hi> Claſps, againſt the Aſſaults of Worm and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But theſe defenſeleſs Conduits of Advertiſement are ſo much more obnoxious, by reaſon of their Nakedneſs and Debility, to all deſtructive Caſualties, that it is more rare and difficult, for Want of a proper <hi>Aſylum,</hi> to meet with ſome <hi>Tracts</hi> which have not been Printed Ten Years, than with many <hi>Books</hi> which are more than ten Times their Age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi>; As being the livelieſt Pictures of their Times. <hi>Pamphlets</hi> having this conſiderable Advantage, that ſpringing uſually from ſome immediate Occaſion, they are copied more directly from the Life; ſo likelier to bear a Reſemblance, than any more extended Draughts taken by a remoter Light. But being therefore a Kind of Reading <hi>à la Mode,</hi> and the Events, their Sources, ſo ſuddenly giving Way to every freſh Current of Affairs, it is no Wonder if theſe little Maps of them are, in like Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, over-borne, and become as tranſient as they: And yet whenever the Political Wheel rouls into any of its former Tracks, or preſent Occurrences tally with thoſe of paſt Times, doubtleſs what was <hi>then</hi> advanced for the Public Good, might <hi>now</hi> be conducive thereto: Whereas the Diſorders of former Times revive, and the Remedies which were preſcribed againſt them are to ſeek; many, as well pleaſant as profitable, being loſt merely for Want of Revival.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi>; The trueſt Images of their Authors. For, Pamphlets running ſo often upon new, particular, and unprecedented Subjects, the Writers have leſs Opportunity to <hi>commit,</hi> and their Writings are leſs liable to <hi>admit</hi> ſuch foul and frequent Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Plagiary,</hi> as Books of Matter more Various, and Bulk more Voluminous, too often exhibit. Beſides, the Author being more vigorouſly prompted to Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the Expediency of bringing forth his Work opportunely <q>is urged (as has been elſewhere ſaid upon another Occaſion <note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay on Epiſtolary Writings, <hi>&amp;c. 8</hi>vo, <hi>M. S.</hi>
                  </note>) to ſtrike out the Images of his Mind at a Heat, in the moſt natural Form and Symmetry, in the moſt ſignificant Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances at once; ſeldom allowing Leiſure for the Writer to doat upon, or dream over his Work: neither to diſguiſe it with the Conceptions of other Men, nor to deform it with Chimeras of his own.</q> Hence are they preferred by many
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0131401400:11"/>
Critics, to diſcover the genuine Abilities of an Author, before his more dilatory and accumulated Productions.</p>
            <p>Theſe, beſides many other Arguments which might be deduced from the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Brevity, the vaſt Choice, or Variety of well-written <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly their regretted Diſperſion, Conſumption and Obſcurity; but, above all, the many ſurpriſing Scenes to be unfolded, and brought in View, by ſelect and public Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from the rich but diſregarded Store, are, in my Opinion, ſufficient Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to the Encouragement of ſuch a Revival. What few Attempts have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been made, ſeem either of a ſhort-ſighted Nature, or of one too unbounded. Thus <hi>Edward Husband,</hi> circumſcribes himſelf to the Speeches and Ordinances of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in a few Years of K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. As the Collections in K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. and K. <hi>William</hi>'s Reigns, contain only ſome <hi>State-Tracts</hi> of thoſe Times. And, for <hi>John Dunton</hi>'s Collection, it might have ſucceeded better, had he not been for rambling into foreign, or heavy and unaffecting Subjects. But the Undertaking moſt likely to ſucceed, is one wholly unconfined, as to Time, and only confined to Matter domeſtically applicable; provided the Undertaker chuſes judiciouſly his Materials. And, certainly, the Public might ſoon be obliged with a very valuable Collection, if in thoſe Particulars whereof the Collector's own Store ſhould be deficient, he were ſupplied by ſuch Poſſeſſors of theſe Curioſities, as have a Reliſh for the Project: Which may be farther rendered a convenient Receptacle for the Reſtoration of what is not only rare and remarkable, but pertinent and ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>And ſuch, among others, are the Advantages promiſed us by the preſent <hi>PHOENIX</hi>; which, if it ever grows into a Volume, and is accommodated with a compleat <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex,</hi> I cannot help fancying, we ſhall imagine ourſelves led into new and untrodden Paths; into Regions of neglected but notable Intelligence, which, having lain long dormant, and widely remote from ordinary Obſervation, will look like a ſudden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Characters and Deſcriptions, Schemes and Diſcoveries; or rather a Kind of Re-Creation of them in the Land of <hi>Literature:</hi> So that it may yield the beſt Comment upon paſt Times, and become the grand Expoſitor of many Incidents, which General Hiſtorians are either wholly ignorant of, or very ſuperficially mention.</p>
            <p>Thus, my LORD, you have the free, but undigeſted <hi>Thoughts</hi> of one totally diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the Undertaking aforeſaid, and no otherwiſe concerned for the ſame, than as a Well-wiſher to what I cannot but think may be of public Utility: And the juſter Title they may have to your favourable Cenſure, as being the immediate Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of your Commands. I might, indeed, have farther inlarged on a Theme ſo fruitful; but in handling the Subject of <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> it may not be diſcommendable to conform my ſelf to their Size: For, <q>Inter Pygmaeos non pudet eſſe brevem.</q> More eſpecially when I conſider, that I may have already treſpaſſed farther upon your Lordſhip's Patience, than will admit of an Apology from</p>
