            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <head type="sub">Which (for the better underſtanding of the Book) the Reader is deſired to peruſe firſt.</head>
            <p>THIS little Book, purely for want of Leiſure to look over and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it in order for a ſecond Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has been, out of Priot a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable While; neither ſhould I have ſpar'd time now from my other Affairs and private Practice, which indeed is ſufficient to ingroſs all my Thoughts, had it not been very often call'd for, ſince the firſt Impreſſion has been Sold off, and my ſelf mush importun'd to reprint it, on account of the ſervice the Medicines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcib'd in it have done, daily do, and are further likely to do, thoſe afflicted with the Illneſſes it treats of.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:0202200100:4"/>
            <p>In this ſecond Edition I have added, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and amended, whatever the many Obſervations I have made, and my longer Experience caus'd me to think neceſſary, and have given every where very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and more minute Directions, how the Patients ſhould manage themſelves under the Courſe of Remedies I have advis'd to, than was in the firſt Edition, ſo that as the Cenſoriouſneſs of the Age we live in, and no other reaſon, made me deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine when I firſt publiſh'd this Book, not to ſet my Name to it, or be known as the Author, there will now be the leſs oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it.</p>
            <p>I deſign'd to have added ſome very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Caſes of Perſons that I have very lately Cur'd, of the ſeveral Diſtempers the Book treats of, and that by the very Medicines I have herein preſcribed; but conſidering that thoſe Additions, would inhance the price of the Book, and that the Caſes inſerted in the firſt Edition, are ſufficient to illuſtrate the Method recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, I reſolv'd to let it remain (in that reſpect) juſt as it was before.</p>
            <p>When I firſt commenced Phyſician, I conſider'd how and after what manner I could render my ſelf ſerviceable to the
<pb facs="tcp:0202200100:5"/>Publick in my Station, and obſerving that few of our Faculty had bent their Study, to gain a true Knowledge of the Cauſe and Cure of Female Grievances, under which abundance of Women liv'd miſerably, labouring with afflicting Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, continually Languiſhing and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming by deplorable Illneſſes, peculiar to that Sex, and at laſt forced to ſubmit to Death, purely for want of proper Advice and Medicines for their Diſtempers, which I then thought, as I ſoon after found, might be eaſily Cured by an ingenious Phyſician, if he rightly underſtood the true Cauſe of them: Seriouſly weighing this, I reſolved to Study the Cure of the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Maladies incident only to Women, many of the Gentlemen of our Profeſſion (tho' moſt Learned aind Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in other Caſes) not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Female Diſtempers, becauſe not inclined to Study or Practiſe that way, whereby thouſands of Women, I believe, have lamentably ſuffered many Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and numbers gone to the Grave many Years ſooner, than they would have done, had they been treated in a proper Method, and with the moſt Efficacious Medicines.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:0202200100:6"/>
            <p>I know it is a common Thing for ſome Gentlemen of our Art, to excuſe their not practiſing in thoſe Illneſſes, by alledging that Women have their Midwives to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to in ſuch Caſes; but if they mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider'd the danger Women are in, from even the leaſt degree of the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes I have in this Book treated of, I am ſure they would be of another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: For indeed how can it be ſuppoſed that Midwives, though Ingenious in their proper Buſineſs, ſhould Cure Diſtempers of which they know not the Cauſe, but are truly ignorant of the whole Matter; being unacquainted with the Medical Art, not in the leaſt underſtanding the Virtue of Medicines, or the Reaſon of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Operations upon the Blood and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fluids of the Body? So that if a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is cur'd of Weakneſs or Illneſs by them, it may be juſtly eſteem'd a mere Chance, and ſhe has reaſon to thank God, that inſtead of Cure ſhe did not meet with Ruin, having truſted her Life to the Unskilful; which Women would never do, if they were ſenſible of the Nature and Danger of even their ſlighteſt Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſitions, if not manag'd rightly.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:0202200100:7"/>
            <p>Thus, when I firſt began to practiſe Phyſick, being convinced by theſe Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Reflections, that I could be very uſeful in my Generation, by ſtudying and obtaining the perfect Knowledge of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions incident only to the Female Sex, I reſolved to endeavour to find out the real Cauſe thereof, and, if poſſible, a better and more certain method of Cure than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly practiſed, which with diligent Study, much Application and careful Obſervation, I quickly obtain'd in ſuch a meaſure, that I thank God I have had very great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and have perfectly cured abundance of the Female Sex, who had ſuffer'd many Years under deplorable Sickneſs; and have alſo retrieved ſeveral from the edge of the Grave, who had been given over by all; inſomuch, that many, who through Illneſs afflicting them have been reduced to mere Skeletons, and ſo weak as ſcarcely able to ſtand, I have, through the Bleſſing of God, reſtored to their perfect Health and Strength, ſo as to become more brisk and well than ever, and to Conceive and bear Children, and that by the Method and Medicines inferred in this Book, which, after many Changes and Experiments, I have pitch'd upon, and by unqueſſionable Experience have found them abſolutely
<pb facs="tcp:0202200100:8"/>Effectual, and do now wholly rely upon them in my private Practice.</p>
            <p>But becoming ſtill more and more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Miſery moſt Women undergo at one time or other, through Illneſs afflicting them, and conſidering that a great many of the Female Sex, are unwilling to make known their private Indiſpoſitions to Men, (tho' that Modeſty often proves the Loſs of their Lives) and that thoſe who do, many times ſtay till too late to be Cured, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps fall into the Hands of Practitioners, that do not rightly underſtand their Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or elſe apply to Midwives for help, commonly to their Ruin: I ſay, thinking on the diſmal Misfortunes and Calamitous Circumſtances, that thus attend, injure, and often deſtroy many Women in the Prime of their Age, it put me upon undertaking ſomething whereby I might be more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſeful to the World, and in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree ſerviceable to Suffering Women, than I could be in Private Practice only: Therefore I choſe to write this little Book, wherein I have practically treated in a familiar way, and ſo as the meaneſt Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may underſtand, of the Symptoms, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Cauſe, and Cure of the Secret Illneſſes that Women are ſubject to, and have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd,
<pb facs="tcp:0202200100:9"/>as before mention'd, ſuch Medicines as will moſt certainty Cure them without Trouble; whereby Women, who are not willing to make known their Weakneſſes and Diſeaſes, may be acquainted with their Diſtempers, and know how to Cure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafely, and for a trifling Charge; by which means, thoſe who before were thought uncapable of Conceiving, may be render'd Fruitful, and others be retriev'd from the Danger of Death, which moſt of the Illneſſes, I have mention'd, will certainly bring upon the Patients, if not timely Cur'd.</p>
            <p>The Medicines I have adviſed to, are pleaſant to take, ſafe and eaſie in Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being founded upon unerring Experience, are certainly to be depended upon, as abſolutely Effectual for the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Illneſſes they are mentioned to Cure.</p>
            <p>And conſidering the Trouble and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty moſt Women would find, to get the Medicines made up, and the hazard they would run in truſting to Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries Boys, that underſtand not the Art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Method of compounding Medicines: Therefore, that nothing might be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:0202200100:10"/>wherein I could render my ſelf ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, I have left a quantity of all the Medicines, mention'd in this Book, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with my own Hand, with the Gentlewoman, at the <hi>Two Blue Posts,</hi> near the <hi>Square,</hi> in <hi>Haydon-Yard</hi> in the <hi>Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, London;</hi> where this Book is alſo Sold, and intend always ſo to do, for the Benefit of the Female Sex, while God grants me Life; and I here aſſure the World, that I will never ſuffer the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to be ſold elſewhere, without firſt giving Notice in another Edition of this Book; ſo that all Perſons who have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for any of the Medicines herein preſcrib'd, will, by buying them there, always be ſure to have them right and well prepared, upon which they may entirely rely for the Cure of the Illneſſes they are appropriated to.</p>
            <p>And the better to prevent all Abuſes, I have deſignedly conceal'd the chief Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Preparation in every Preſcription, on which Secret, the Virtue of each Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, moſtly depends, and without which, would be almoſt inſignificant, but being regularly Compounded, or mix'd, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Art, does ſo alter, ferment, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapt all the Ingredients in each preſcribed
<pb facs="tcp:0202200100:11"/>Remedy, to the Cure of the Illneſs for which it is intended, that were it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, it would appear wonderful to all Artiſts in Phyſick.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of my thus concealing the moſt Powerful Ingredient of each Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, was, that becauſe Women cannot make up the Medicines themſelves, they muſt, had I freely declared the whole, have had them made up by an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, who, very likely, by reaſon of the dearneſs of the main Ingredient in each, would exact an Extravagant Price, or elſe not make the Medicines up right; but put in one thing inſtead of another, which many Apothecaries too often do, in making up Chargeable Preſcriptions, to the detriment of the Patient and Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Phyſician.</p>
            <p>Therefore to prevent any from being ſo groſsly impoſed upon, and to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy all Inconveniencies, was it, that I did not make known the chief Ingredient in each Preſcription; but appointed the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, rightly prepared with great Care and Exactneſs, to be Sold at the Place before mentioned, and for the fixed eaſy Prices ſet down in the Catalogue of them
<pb facs="tcp:0202200100:12"/>at the end of the Book, which Prices are as reaſonable, as the Medicines can well be allowed for, and much Cheaper than they would be, if rightly made up in ſmall quanties by any other Perſon, were the Specifick Preparation in each Remedy known; I having in this Second Edition, carefully calculated the intrinſick Value of them, and for the ſake of thoſe whoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may not be extraordinary, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd the Price where there was room for it, ſo that moſt of the Medicines are now ſet down at a cheaper Rate, than they were in the firſt Edition.</p>
            <p>Now by this means, all Gentlewomen, and others, will be freed from Trouble, and beſure of having the true Preparation, which will always prove effectual, and that at an eaſy Rate, by only ſending a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or other Perſon to the Place afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, to ask for ſuch or ſuch a Medicine, by its Name or Number, and by giving ſo much for it, as in the Catalogue is ſet down to be the Price.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who live in the Country may alſo order any Friend in <hi>London,</hi> or a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier that comes to Town, to buy at the ſame Place any of the Medicines they
<pb facs="tcp:0202200100:13"/>have occaſion for, and ſo be ſupply'd with them with Eaſe.</p>
            <p>Thus the main Intent of writing this Treatiſe was for the Service and Benefit of the Female Sex; and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtudying Artfully to embelliſh it with powerful Rhetorick, or a beautiful Stile, I choſe to let it appear in a plain Dreſs, ſo as to be perfectly underſtood by the meaneſt Capacity, which perhaps may give Diſtaſte to ſome of our Learned Criticks, who I did not deſign to pleaſe, and whoſe Cenſure I do not value, being well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that all Men of Ingenuity and Candour, who Practiſe Phyſick, in whoſe Hands it may chance to fall, will applaud the Undertaking; for they will plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that an Intent of being Serviceable to my Generation, was the chief Motive of it, and will alſo find, (notwithſtanding I have conceal'd the main Ingredient in every Preſcription) that the Book will be of Uſe to young Practitioners in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, I having in a more conciſe manner diſcover'd the Signs, Nature, Cauſes, and beſt and neareſt Method of Cure, of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Grievances, than perhaps they may elſewhere meet with, and in the Seventh Chapter treating of Barrenneſs, have given
<pb facs="tcp:0202200100:14"/>ſuch a clear and particular Account of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Generation, as may ſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify the Notions of ſeveral, who have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bib'd very abſurd Opinions concerning them.</p>
            <p>One thing I muſt inform my Readers of, which is, That while I was writing this Book, I was often concern'd, that neceſſity obliged me to mention Womens Weakneſſes ſo plainly, as I found my ſelf forced to do, to be well underſtood by the Female Sex; could I have made it intelligible otherwiſe, I ſhould have been heartily glad; but that being impoſſible, I have treated of all their Indiſpoſitions, with as much Caution and Modeſty as I could, and therefore hope none will make an ill uſe of it, or in the leaſt blame me on that account.</p>
            <p>I ſhall no longer detain my Readers, but hoping it will meet with a Reception ſuitable to my good Intention of Writing it for the Benefit of Suffering Women, and leaving them to judge of it themſelves, ſubſcribe my ſelf Their</p>

               <p>IN treating of the Natural Weakneſſes and Diſtempers peculiarly incident to the Female Sex, I ſhall begin with thoſe occaſion'd by the Irregularity of the Menſtrual Flux, or Courſes, which begin to flow in Young Women when they are about Fourteen Years old, and in ſome ſooner: About that Age Virgins begin to grow ripe, and if in Health, to think of Love; the Blood alſo at certain Periods undergoes a new Ferment, and while that continues, iſſues out through the Blood-Veſſels
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0202200100:18"/>that open into the Womb: And this Natural Purgation, or Flux of Blood, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Monthly Terms or Courſes.</p>
               <p>When they firſt come down in Maids, they many times do not flow above once in two Months or ten Weeks; but as the Perſon grows more ripe, and the blood and its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Ferment encreaſes, they come down oftner, till the ſettled Term of once a Month is fixed, and then they continue ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till Forty, Forty five, and ſometimes till Fifty Years of Age, or longer, except when Illneſs, being with Child, or Suckling Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hinders.</p>
               <p>They flow generally from firſt to laſt, four, five or ſix Days, and ſometimes, though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely, ſeven; and the Quantity of Blood that comes away during that time, (if the Flux is regular, and the Perſon in perfect Health) is commonly as much as may be contained in the Shell of a Gooſe Egg; but in ſome Women, eſpecially thoſe of a ſtrong Body and ſanguine Complexion, they flow in a larger quantity than in others: If the Terms flow conſtantly once a Month, and in a due quantity, they generally preſerve Women in perfect Health; but if they do not, or if there is any Diſorder in this Flux, Women cannot be well, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The Diſorders this Monthly Purgation is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0202200100:19"/>liable to, being ſeveral, and very different, I intend to treat of them, and of the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions Women are particularly ſubject to, in their Order, and under their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Heads or Chapters.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Deficiency of the Terms, and Green-Sickneſs in Virgins.</head>
               <p>THE Deficiency or Suppreſſion of the Courſes, is when they flow too ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or but little in quantity, (that is too ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, as by Drops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) or not at all: The Fault is either in the Blood, (which is then too groſs or thick, occaſion'd by a bad Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, ill Digeſtion of Food, Colds, Grief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or in the Veſſels of the Womb, through which the Terms flow, which then are obſtructed by a Viſcous or Tough Humour.</p>
               <p>If the Badneſs of the blood is the Cauſe of the Deficiency of the Courſes, the Perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes pale and dull, unwilling to ſtir about, and is afflicted with Loſs of Appetite, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Food, deſire after things not fit to be eaten, bad Digeſtion, Pain in the Stomach, which in ſome Patients is ſo violent by Fits, as hardly to be borne, Shortneſs of Breath, often ſwelling about the Ankles, ſometimes vomiting, and univerſal Diſorder; alſo if any
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0202200100:20"/>Blood does flow, it generally appears of a pale and wan Colour.</p>
               <p>If the Fault be in the Veſſels of the Womb, the Perſon then retains her uſual Colour; but, at the time the Courſes ought to flow, feels racking Pains in the ſmall of her Back, and about her Loins Wearineſs of her Limbs, and moving Pains accompanied with a violent Motion of the Blood, fluſhing in the Face, Vapours, Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, and general uneaſineſs over the whole Body; and ſometimes the Blood iſſues out at the Noſe, Hemorrhoid-Veins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Courſes do not flow at all in Maids, and the Obſtruction is of long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is then called the Green-ſickneſs; but Widows, and ſometimes married Women, are afflicted with this Diſtemper: The latter muſt take great Care they do not miſtake the Stoppage of the Monthly Courſes, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by their conceiving, for this Diſeaſe, leaſt by taking Medicines to cure their fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Illneſs, they ſhould cauſe a Miſcarriage; but if they have not their Courſes for three or four Months together, and become pale and wan, with difficulty of Breathing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without growing bigger, or having any Signs of being with Child, they may then be aſſured that the Deficiency or Suppreſſion of the Terms is a Diſtemper, and not cauſed by Impregnation or Conception.</p>
               <p>If the Deficiency or Stoppage of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0202200100:21"/>is not ſpeedily remedied, Barrenneſs, and very dangerous Illneſſes will be produced, as Cachexy, Aſthma, Inflammation, and Ulceration of the Lungs, Pleuriſie, Hyſterick Fits, Dropſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to take off all or any of the above enumerated Symptoms, to prevent the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Effects of this Indiſpoſition, and to cure the Deficiency or Suppreſſion of the Courſes, whether in Maids, Married Women, or Widows, ſuch Medicines muſt be given, as will cleanſe the Stomach and firſt Paſſages, diſſolve all viſcous Humours, purifie the Blood and Juices, reſtore their Natural Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and effectually open all Manner of Obſtructions in any Part of the Body, after which, ſuch Corroborating, Deobſtructive Remedies muſt be preſcribed, as will confirm the Texture of the Fluids, ſtrengthen the Stomach and Bowels, create an Appetite, cauſe a good Digeſtion, and finally eſtabliſh the Blood in its natural florid State, and thereby aſſuredly reſtore a good Colour to the Face, and perfect Health to the Body.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place therefore, three or four Days before the Terms are expected or ought to flow, the Patient muſt take four of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Purging Pills, betimes in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſting; but if it be the firſt Time of their Stoppage, and happens, as ſometimes it will, after the Courſes have begun to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, then the Purging Pills muſt be taken
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0202200100:22"/>the very next Morning, Drinking Water-Gruel, Poſſet-drink, Barly-water, warm Ale, or Tea, in the Working, and they will give four, five or fix eaſy Stools, handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleanſe the Stomach and Bowels, and do infinite Good; ſometimes a Doſe alone will bring down the Courſes eſpecially if the Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be but of ſhort ſtanding, and occaſioned only by Obſtruction of the Womb-Veſſels. They are thus made,

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0202200100:24"/>happen, then it will be neceſſary to take an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Doſe of the Purging Pills, and a Day or two after that, the Pouder again in like Order as before, and ſo to continue it till the Illneſs is effectually cured, which will ſoon be, obſerving all the while ſhe is under this Courſe, to abſtain from all Fruit, Greens, and Herbs, and alſo not to drink too freely of ſmall Liquors, ſuch as Tea, Small Beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only what is juſt ſufficient to quench Drowth; for ſmall Liquors being drank quickly after taking the Pouder, or in too large a Quantity at any time, will not only prevent its having ſo good Effect as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would, but alſo cauſe a little Sickiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at Stomach.</p>

               <p>If the Patient finds four of the purging Pills work a little too much the firſt time ſhe takes them, then the next time ſhe muſt take but three of them for a Doſe, but if ſhe finds four of them not purge enough, then ſhe muſt take five Pills for the next Doſe.</p>
               <p>But if the Patient by being long afflicted with this Illneſs, or by taking other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, is brought into a very weak Condition, ſo as to be unfit to bear Purging, then ſhe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0202200100:25"/>muſt not take the Purging Pills, but begin with the Opening Pouder, and continue to take it conſtantly as directed before, without taking the Purging Pills at all, and during the time ſhe is taking the Pouder to provoke the Terms, ſhe muſt uſe moderate Exerciſe almoſt continually, ſuch as walking abroad, or riding on Horſe-back, ſtirring about Houſe, up and down Stairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0202200100:27"/>Pouder before mentioned, which happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured her: She chanced accidentally to take my Medicines thus:</p>
               <p>Her Father being in <hi>London</hi> about ſix Weeks ago, was, with ſeveral other Elderly Men and their Wives, invited by a worthy Gentleman his Friend, to Dine with him, I being alſo deſired, made one of the Company, and after Dinner, among other Diſcourſe, the Gentlewomen happening to talk of the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Sickneſſes they had ſuffer'd, and of the Indiſpoſitions ſeveral of their Friends labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under, the <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> Gentleman took that Opportunity, underſtanding I was a Phyſician, to acquaint me with his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Illneſs: As ſoon as he had done, I was ſent for away, but heard afterwards, that the Company proceeding on that Topick, the Gentleman of the Houſe, and his Wife, were pleaſed to ſpeak much to my Advantage, in reſpect to the great Succeſs that attended my Practice in Female Diſtempers. 'The <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire</hi> Gentleman went into the Country the next Morning, and coming to his Houſe, found his Wife, who is about Thirty ſix Years of Age, exceeding ill, with torturing Pains in her Back, and ſometimes in her Head, attended with fluſhing in her Face, Feveriſh Heat, and univerſal Uneaſineſs, which was all occaſioned by a Suppreſſion of the Courſes, through a violent Cold ſhe got, when they were juſt ready to flow; It being
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0202200100:28"/>the firſt time ſhe had been afflicted in that manner, ſhe was the more ſurprized at it, and as her Husband came in, was going to ſend for a Phyſician near them, under whoſe Hands her Daughter had for ſome time been; but her Husband mentioning what he had heard of my Skill, and both of them conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what little Help their Daughter had received, from the Preſcriptions of all the Phyſicians they had conſulted concerning her, reſolved to ſend to me; accordingly, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman wrote his Wife's Caſe, in a Letter, and ſent his Servant on Horſeback with it immediately, deſiring me to adviſe to what I thought proper, and ſend ſomething by his Man as ſoon as could be; I conſider'd the Lady's Caſe, and being ſenſible that her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, and all the Symptoms would be removed by provoking her Courſes, which were only hindred from coming down by an Obſtruction the violent Cold had cauſed, in the Veſſels of the Womb, through which the Blood flows; I therefore ſent her a Box of my Purging Pills, one Doſe of which I expected would remedy the whole Matter, but leaſt the Stoppage of the Terms ſhould prove ſtubborn, as ſometimes it will, I ſent her a pretty large quantity of my Opening Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo, with Directions to take four of the purging Pills betimes the next Morning, and if they did not accompliſh the Buſineſs, to begin the Opening Pouder the Day following
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0202200100:29"/>juſt as I have directed before in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till her Courſes came down, after which I wrote, that it would be neceſſary for her to take my Corroborating Electuary, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm her Health, and prevent a Relapſe for the future; I inform'd the Gentleman alſo, that if one Doſe of the purging Pills remov'd her Illneſs, then if he pleaſed, to let his Daughter take the Pills and Pouder in the ſame Manner as I directed his Wife to take them, I was ſatisfied they would cure her alſo: They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed my Advice, and the Medicines had the deſired Effect, not only upon the Gentleman's Wife, whom one Doſe of the Pills ſet to rights, but alſo upon his Daughter, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther young Woman at <hi>Hartford,</hi> who were both cured, as by the Letter, which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſent me, with a very handſome Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, appears more particularly.</p>

                     <p>I Send this to return you my hearty Thanks for the great Service you have done my Family: One Doſe of your Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Pills brought my Wife into good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without taking the Opening Pouder at all. I ſhould have wrote to you before now, but that my Wife receiving ſo much Benefit, was reſolved that my Daughter, who had been ill with the Green-Sickneſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0202200100:30"/>a great while, and had taken abundance of Phyſick in vain, as I told you, when I was in <hi>London,</hi> ſhould take both your Pills and Opening Pouder, as you adviſed in your Letter, and therefore I delayed Writing till I could give you an Account of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they had upon her: She being tired with taking Medicines, was with much difficulty perſuaded to take one Doſe of the Purging Pills, which worked very well, and being a little weak the next Day, ſhe did not begin the Opening Pouder till the Day following; but then continued it, conſtantly for about three Weeks, after which, ſhe took another Doſe of the Purging Pills, and the next Day the Opening Pouder again, which ſhe took for about tour Days more, and it brought the Benefit of Nature upon her, ſince which, ſhe eats drinks and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts her Victuals well, looks ſomething freſh and ruddy, and is recover'd to Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. My Wife gave the Remainder of the Pouder to a Neighbour's Daughter, who was in the ſame Condition, but ſo weak as not fit to take the Purging Pills, and that alone has Cured her, in about a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, all but Want of Strength, which ſhe now daily recovers, and begins to look brisk, and have a good Stomach. Now Sir, my Wife and Daughter, and the young Woman, deſire you to ſend the Corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Electuary, that in your Letter you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0202200100:31"/>me would be neceſſary for my Wife to take after the other Medicines to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Health, and prevent Relapſe, and they believe, by the excellent Effects they have already found by your Pills and Pouder, that That will be all the Phyſick they ſhall have occaſion for.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the immoderate Flux, or Over-flowing of the <hi>Terms.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Courſes are properly deem'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate, when the Blood flows from the Womb-Veſſels in too large a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, or too long together, or oftner than once a Month. In ſome Women they continue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Days together, in others not longer than uſual, but then return often, as once a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, or ſooner, and in ſome the Flux is more, in others leſs violent, many Women alſo, as ſoon as the Courſes ſtop, are afflicted with the Whites, or Piles, and ſometimes with both.</p>
               <p>This Illneſs, or exceſſive Flowing of the Terms, is generally cauſed by an evil Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, occaſioned by ſharp ſcorbutick Salts in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0202200100:32"/>the Blood and Juices, and ſometimes by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of the Womb-Veſſels.</p>
               <p>The Overflowing of the Courſes is moſt commonly accompanied with a burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Heat, tearing Pains in the ſmall of the Back, Pain and Heat about the Neck of the Womb, violent Head-ach, Loſs of Appetite, and languiſhing Weakneſs of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and if not ſpeedily cured, reduces the Perſon exceedingly, cauſing total Barrenneſs, laſting Weakneſs, pining Conſumption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which terminate in Death, if not timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied.</p>
               <p>If the Blood that comes away is of a bright red Colour, and when taken upon Linnen and dry, diſcovers a pale Circle, it ſhews that the Blood is thin and wateriſh, the Veſſels of the Womb too lax or looſe, the Patient very weak, but not exceeding Feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; but if it be of a deep red, and eaſily clots, it is then a Sign of a Redundancy of Blood, and that the Perſon is very hot feveriſh and uneaſie, and if the Blood in coming away cauſes a great Itching and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs of the Parts, it ſhews, that the Juices of the Body are very full of ſharp acrid Salts</p>
               <p>Now to cure this Indiſpoſition (Revulſion by Bleeding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being firſt made) ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines muſt be preſcribed, as by their cooling, abſorbent, and ſub-aſtringent Qualities, wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For which End, and effectually to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the afore-mention'd ill Conſequences, the Patient muſt firſt be let Blood in the Arm, to the Quantity of about Nine or Ten Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the very next Morning about ſix a Clock, ſhe muſt take the Quantity of a very large Wallnut, or more of the following Lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative Electuary, either by it ſelf, or diſſolved in a little thin Water-gruel, which ſhe likes beſt, and ſleeping about an Hour after it; and if in about two Hours after it is taken, it ſhould not move her to Stool, then it will be proper for her to take as much more of it, ſo as to give her five or ſix Stools: Water-gruel, Barley-water, or Tea, are Liquors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be drank after it begins to operate.

               <p>If the Patient, while ſhe is taking the pleaſant Specifick Electuary, finds her ſelf Coſtive, or hard bound, then once in three or four Days ſhe muſt take a Doſe of the Laxative or Looſening Electuary in the Morning faſting, as before directed, (omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to take the other Medicines that Day) and it will give three, or four gentle Stools, and make the Body pleaſant and eaſie, without Griping, making ſick, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or cauſing the leaſt Trouble or Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>Thus, theſe Directions being followed, and the Medicines regularly taken, the over-flowing of the Courſes, though never ſo bad, will moſt certainly be cured; an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Inſtance or two of which, occurring to my Memory, I judge the Relation will be acceptable, as well as ſerviceable to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and therefore will inſert the Particulars, and ſo end this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The firſt Caſe I deſign to mention, is of a Gentlewoman about Thirty, who for ſix or eight Months before, had been afflicted with the flowing of her Courſes conſtantly once a Fortnight, in the ſame quantity that uſed to flow, when ſhe was in good Order, once a Month, and as ſoon as they went off, ſhe was exceedingly troubled with the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0202200100:38"/>Piles for three or four Days, and after that, with the Whites to an exceſſive Degree which always held her till her Terms came down again. This Indiſpoſition had reduced her to exceeding Weakneſs, her Stomach was much out of Order; ſhe was continually feveriſh, had great Pain in her Head, but a more violent Pain in her Back, inſomuch that ſhe was hardly able to walk about Houſe. As ſoon as I was acquainted with her Illneſs, I found that her Blood, by the pale Circle it diſcover'd upon Linnen, was poor, wateriſh, and very acrid, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the Feveriſh Heat, and all the other Symptoms.</p>
               <p>And conſidering that her Stomach and Bowels were very foul, I therefore firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd her to take a very large Doſe of my Laxative Electuary the next Morning to cleanſe them, which had very good Effect, and the Day following I cauſed her to begin my Cooling Anodyne Pouder, and pleaſant Specifick Electuary, and take them as before directed, for two Days, which took off all immoderate Heat, and ſtopt her Courſes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, I directed her to continue the pleaſant Specifick Electuary alone, for a Fortnight, in order to abſorb all ſharp Humours, rectifie her Blood, and ſtrengthen her Back and Womb Veſſels; but in three Days time ſhe ſent me Word, that ſhe believed ſhe ſhould
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0202200100:39"/>be troubled with the Piles, being ſomewhat Coſtive, and a little pained when ſhe went to Stool. I therefore order'd her to take a large Doſe of the Laxative Electuary again the next Morning betimes, and to omit the pleaſant Specifick Electuary that Day, and ſo to take the Laxative One, once every three or four Days, if ſhe found her ſelf Coſtive, and the pleaſant Specifick Electuary conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the other Days for the Remainder of the Fortnight, or till ſhe was quite well, and had perfectly recovered her Strength.</p>
               <p>Accordingly ſhe took the quantity of a large Wallnut of the Laxative Electuary, the next Morning, which gave her two or three looſe Stools, and wholly freed her from all Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the Piles, and the next Day, ſhe began the pleaſant Specifick Electuary again, and thus by following Directions as above, ſhe was ſoon perfectly cured, has had her Courſes in regular Order, never in the leaſt been troubled with the Whites or Piles; but lived in good Health and Strength ever ſince, it being now four Months ago.</p>
               <p>The other Caſe that occurs to my Mind, was of a young Gentlewoman of about Eighteen Years of Age, of a jolly ſanguine Complexion, to whom I was ſent for about three Months ſince. Till a little before tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> time ſhe had always enjoyed perfect Health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but then was taken of a ſudden with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0202200100:40"/>Fever, and an exceeding Flux of the Courſes; when I came to her ſhe had had them for ten or twelve Days upon her, and they ſtill continued to flow in an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large quantity.</p>
               <p>Her Fever, notwithſtanding the great Loſs of Blood ſhe had ſuffer'd, being very high, I order'd her to bleed immediately in the Arm, which in ſome Meaſure diverted the Courſe of the Blood; I did not give her my Laxative Electuary, ſhe being very weak, and her Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Bowels not foul; but preſently ſent her my Cooling Anodyne Pouder, and pleaſant Specifick Electuary, directing her to take both in the Manner above order'd, for about four Days; ſhe had not taken above ſix Doſes of each, but her Feveriſh Heat was overcome and her Courſes ſtopt; on the fourth Day ſhe happened to be a little griped, therefore I order'd her to leave off the Cooling Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne Pouder, and take only the pleaſant Specifick Electuary, which ſhe did for two or three days longer, and it perfectly cured her, ſhe only remaining a little weak, occaſion'd by the exceeding Flux ſhe had labour'd under; but ſhe ſoon recover'd her Strength without any more Medicines, and has remain'd well ever ſince. There was no abſolute neceſſity for her to continue the pleaſant Specifick Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary any longer, becauſe the ſudden hot Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of her Blood, which was the cauſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0202200100:41"/>of her Illneſs, being taken off by Bleeding and the cooling Medicines, the Effects of courſe ceaſed without much Fear of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But in the Gentlewoman's Caſe firſt mentioned, it was quite different; for her Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being cauſed by acrid Salts in her Blood, and having continued a long time, it had much injur d the Womb-Veſſels, which could not be ſtrengthen'd ſufficiently, nor her Blood have been rectified as it ought, without taking the pleaſant Specifick Electuary, for a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night or more; and indeed, could the young Gentlewoman have been perſuaded to have taken it for Nine or Ten Days longer, which ſhe refuſed, it would have been the better for her, for ſhe would have thereby recover'd more Strength in one Day, than without it ſhe did in three, it being ſo excellently pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in reſtoring Perſons weakned by that Illneſs.</p>

               <p>But effectually to cure this Indiſpoſition, ſo as not to be liable to it for the future, the Patient, when the preſent Fit of Pain is overcome, and as ſoon as her Courſes ceaſe to flow, muſt begin my pleaſant O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening Pouder, preſcrib'd in the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Book, Page 7. and take it conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and exactly as there directed, for a whole Month, ſix Weeks, or longer, which will aſſuredly free her from any future Return of Pain and Uneaſineſs at the time the Terms begin to flow, entirely prevent all ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0202200100:45"/>of that Indiſpoſition, and abſolutely eſtabliſh Health and Strength.</p>
               <p>In ſome Women, the Courſes are of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ugly Colours, the Blood that flows being yellowiſh, livid, black, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times has a very nauſeous Smell; which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders are cauſed by the Badneſs of the whole Maſs of Blood, or its particular Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Veſſels of the Womb: The Blood and Juices therefore muſt be purified, and the whole Body cleanſed by proper Cathartick, and Alterative Medicines, as the Caſe requires; but theſe Indiſpoſitions are ſafely and ſpeedily remedied by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Uterine Drops, the Patient taking eighty or ninety of them or more (firſt ſhaking the Vial) in a Glaſs of White-wine, every Morning Faſting, and at Five a Clock every After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, for three Weeks or a Month together, minding not to eat any thing for half an Hour before or after each Doſe, but to walk about pretty much after taking them. They are made thus.

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Piles.</head>
               <p>THIS Diſtemper being common to Men, as well as to Women, it may be thought ſtrange that I treat of it here; but conſidering that many of the Fair Sex do not care to acquaint Phyſicians that they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the Piles, it made me conclude that this Chapter would prove as ſerviceable, and be as acceptable to them as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>The Indiſpoſition called the Haemorrhoids, or Piles, is miſerably painful, making the Patient exceeding Reſtleſs, Fretful and Faint; it is a Swelling and Soreneſs of the Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoid Veins, juſt within, and ſometimes juſt without the Fundament: When they do not bleed, they are called the Blind Piles and then they generally ſwell much, and cauſe violent Pain and inexpreſſible Torture at going to Stool: The Bleeding Piles though very ſore, are not ſo bad or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0202200100:49"/>as the other, except the Flux is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Violent, and continues long, for then it induces Fainting, Swooning, Loſs of Strength, Citron like Colour of the Skin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the Jaundiſe, Evil Habit of the Body, Conſumption, Dropſy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cauſe of this Illneſs is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Rarefaction and Fermentation of the Blood and Humours, as the Feveriſh Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Patient at that time plainly ſhews, ſo that a Redundancy of Blood, Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of the Terms, (either accidentally, or by irregular Methods) Colds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> often occaſion the Piles, by hindring the uſual Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, and thereby inflaming the Blood, and putting it into a great Ferment, when filling the Haemorrhoid Veins, if they eaſily open, it iſſues out, and if they do not, it there ſtagnates and ſwells them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before mentioned; ſometimes the Piles are cauſed by hard Riding, or other violent Exerciſe, alſo ſevere purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in thoſe Caſes, the Illneſs commonly goes off, by Eaſe, Reſt, and temperate Living.</p>
               <p>If the blind Piles continue long, the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling may grow Scirrhous, and an Ulcer, or Fiſtula, difficult to Cure, may ſucceed.</p>
               <p>To prevent which, and Cure the Piles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Alterative and Cooling Medicines muſt be given inwardly, to allay the Ferment of the Blood, reduce its Diſcracy, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the prime Cauſe of the Diſtemper,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0202200100:50"/>whilſt ſuitable intrinſick Remedies are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly applied, to diſcuſs the Tumour, eaſe Pain, and perfectly heal and cure the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Part.</p>
               <p>If the Patient be Feveriſh, or the Pain and Inflammation great, Bleeding in the Arm, to the quantity of about Ten Ounces, will be abſolutely neceſſary to divert the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; after which, let as much of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Alterative Pouder, as will lie heapd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Shilling, be taken four times every Day, <hi>viz.</hi> betimes in the Morning Faſting, at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven a Clock in the Forenoon, at Four a Clock in the Afternoon, and at Night going to Bed: The Patient may take it in a Spoonful of Beer, Water-gruel, or any other ſmall Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, ſhe likes better, drinking a little of the ſame, made luke-warm, after each Doſe.

               <p>This Intrinſick Liniment quickly gives Eaſe, and mightily contributes to the Cure of both blind and bleeding Piles.</p>
               <p>Thus the Alterative Pouder muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly taken, and the Intrinſick Liniment be carefully uſed according to theſe Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till the Cure either of blind or bleeding Piles is perfectly accompliſhed: They will quickly give Eaſe, and aſſuredly compleat the Cure of the Piles in a ſhort time; for the Alterative Pouder effectually ſtrikes at the firſt Cauſe of that Illneſs, and prevents the parts being ſupply'd with ſharp Humours, while the Intrinſick Liniment, after an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0202200100:52"/>Manner eaſes all pain, diſcuſſes the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or Swelling of the blind Piles, and heals and perfectly cures the bleeding.</p>
               <p>The Alterative Pouder agrees with the Stomach, and takes off all Feveriſh Heat, without diſordering the Body in the leaſt; it ſometimes makes the Belly a little looſe, and thereby contributes very much to the Cure; for nothing is more tormenting, to thoſe troubled with the Piles, than to be Coſtive, or hard bound, it putting them to intollerable pain and miſery at going to Stool.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if the Alterative Pouder ſhould not looſen the Belly, it will be neceſſary for the Patient, once every two or three Days, to take a Doſe of my Laxative Electuary, preſcrib'd in the ſecond Chapter of this Book, page 17. aforegoing, taking it exactly as is there directed; minding only to omit taking the Alterative Pouder, that Day the Laxative Electuary is taken.</p>
               <p>The Patient, during the time ſhe is affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the Piles, ought to drink freely of Water-Gruel, Tea, or Poſſet-drink, made ſmall, and carefully abſtain from ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, Spices, Salt Meats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which tend to inflame and increaſe the Malady.</p>

                  </gap>lewoman who had been afflicted with the Piles almoſt continually, for ſome Years: She having taken very many Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to little or no purpoſe, told me, ſhe fear'd ſhe ſhould never be Cured, yet leaſt ſhe ſhould be wanting to her ſelf, hearing of my Skill, was the Reaſon ſhe had ſent for me, and deſired I would uſe my utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to free her, if poſſible, from her Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; She acquainted me alſo that ſometimes they bled pretty much, and then ſhe was much eaſier than when they only ſwell'd and did not; ſhe was at that time in much Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and being of a hot Conſtitution, and ſomething Feveriſh, I order'd her immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be blooded and preſcrib'd my Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Pouder and intrinſick Liniment, the firſt to be taken, and the latter to be uſed exactly as I have directed in this Chapter, for a Week or nine Days, at the End of which, ſhe was very well, and better, as ſhe affirmed, than ſhe had been for any time in nine Months before; nevertheleſs, I order'd her by all Means to continue the Alterative Pouder for a Fortnight or three Weeks longer, without uſing the Intrinſick Liniment any more.</p>
               <p>My ordering her to take the Alterative Pouder ſo long, was with deſign to correct her Blood, and wholly ſubdue the Acrid Principle, or Cauſe of that ſevere Malady that had ſo long afflicted her, which it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually

               <p>Much about the ſame Time, I had another Woman under my Care, who was alſo ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled with the Piles; her Blood was very Acrid, but ſhe was not exceeding Feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, yet was then in exceeding pain, and a little before ſhe ſent for me, the Piles had bled very much, I therefore did not order her to be blooded, but directed her to take my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terative Pouder, and uſe my Intrinſick Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſently, and continue them till ſhe was cured: In four Days time ſhe was tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably well but happening to be Coſtive, I directed her to take a Doſe of my Laxative Electuary, once every three or four Days, and to take the Alterative Pouder, as dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, on the other Days, which ſhe did, and was perfectly cured in a Fortnights time.</p>
               <p>I could give many more Inſtances of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cured of the Piles by theſe Remedies, who by Reaſon of their being exceeding bad, and having been ſo long afflicted with them, imagined they could never be cured; but deſigning brevity, I ſhall wave that Trouble.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Whites.</head>
               <p>THIS Diſeaſe is the flowing of a White Humour from the Cervical Glandules, or Veſſels about the Neck of the Womb.</p>
               <p>The Whites ſometimes come away in large, and ſometimes in but ſmall Quantities, are attended with Pain in the ſmall of the Back, Pain in the Head, want of Appetite, bad Digeſtion, Wearineſs, Reſtleſsneſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Swelling of the Legs, pale Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Maids of a weakly Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are often afflicted with this Malady, as well as Married Women and Widows.</p>
               <p>If this Diſtemper be not timely remedied, it certainly cauſes incurable Barrenneſs, and the Blood and Juices become more and more depauperated, till a deplorable Conſumption, or Dropſy <hi>&amp;c.</hi> uſhers in Death to end the melancholly Tragedy.</p>
               <p>There are few Women, eſpecially of the weaker ſort, but at one time or other are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with this Illneſs, it being a Diſtemper often attendant upon, and cauſed by other Diſeaſes; and whatever Diſeaſe reduces a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0202200100:56"/>Woman to a languid weakly Frame, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſucceeded by this Indiſpoſition: Thus Women that are naturally of a more weak Habit or Conſtitution than ordinary, are more ſubject to the Whites than others: And as this Illneſs is moſtly occaſioned by foregoing Diſtempers, (tho' ſometimes by ſudden Frights, violent Exerciſe, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Venery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſo it weakens the Body alſo more and more, till the ſuffering Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent becomes a miſerable Victim to Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought into a hopeleſs Conſumption, Dropſy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as aforeſaid, unleſs cured by proper Remedies, adminiſtred by a Skilful Hand.</p>
               <p>But the immediate Cauſe of the Whites, is a Weakneſs, Laxity or Looſeneſs of the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vical Glandules, or Veſſels about the Neck of the Womb, whoſe Tone is either ſpoiled by the ill Conſtitution of the Stomach and Blood, (depraved by other Diſtempers) or by ſome of the Accidents, immoderate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before mention'd; by which Means, thoſe Veſſels cannot ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the proper Humour ſeparated by them from the Blood, to lubricate or moiſten the Neck of the Womb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but let it gleet or ſlide away in too large a quantity, thereby impoveriſhing the Juices of the Body, inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably cauſing Barrenneſs, if not timely cured, and bringing the whole humane Frame into a pining deſperate State.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0202200100:57"/>
               <p>Some Women indeed have this white Flux much more moderate than others, and not continually, but at times only, without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any great or remarkable Proſtration of Strength, till a Year, or two, or more, after its firſt beginning to appear; but then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more violent and dangerous, weakning the Body exceſſively, and, as it were, at once, and is then much more hard to Cure; this being a known and undoubted Truth, that the longer this Flux of white Matter has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the Patient, and the larger in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity it is, the longer time will be required, and the more difficult will it be, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the Cure; the Humours being the more habituated to flow that way, and the Tone of the Glandules or Veſſels, through which they flow, being the more ſpoiled.</p>
               <p>Many Authors write, that if the Whites continue long, they degenerate, and become variouſly Colour'd, as Green, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome times ſmell intollerably ill; but in all the Women I ever had under my Care for this Illneſs, I never could find any ſuch diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Flux, when there was not reaſon to ſuſpect another Diſeaſe, which makes me ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely of the Opinion, that a greeniſh Flux is never ſeen, but where it takes its Riſe from a more malignant Diſtemper, which muſt then be manag'd wholly after a different Manner from the Illneſs I here treat of, otherwiſe the Patient may be ruined.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0202200100:58"/>
               <p>'Tis of great Moment, therefore, carefully to diſtinguiſh the Whites from other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers that reſemble that Malady; for Numbers of Women, who have met with ill Husbands, have labour'd under a Venereal Running, or a Running cauſed by the Foul Diſeaſe, for ſome Years together, ſtill ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining it to be only the Whites: Others have miſtaken a Running, occaſioned by an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in the Womb for that Flux; thus it being very difficult for Women to diſtinguiſh theſe Diſtempers, and yet abſolutely neceſſary that they ſhould, I think it here very proper to give ſome Rules, by which they may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly know one from the other.</p>
               <p>The Whites may be certainly diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from a Gonorrhaea, or Venereal Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by this: That whenever the Courſes come down, the Whites always ceaſe, and do not trouble the Patient again till a little while after the Courſes have done flowing; whereas a Venereal Running remains con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon the Patient, and does not ceaſe during the Flux of the Terms, but continues all they time they flow, as well as before and after.</p>
               <p>The Whites may alſo be diſtinguiſhed from an Ulcer in the Womb by this; That an Ulcer in the Womb, is always attended with very ſharp and gnawing Pains in the Womb, and its Neck, from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Diſeaſe; whereas in the Whites,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0202200100:59"/>tho' ſometimes the Humour may be ſo ſharp as to cauſe Smarting in the outer Parts, yet there is no ſuch ſharp Pain felt in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Parts.</p>
               <p>The Cure of the Whites muſt firſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd, if Strength will admit, by clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stomach and Bowels with Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and afterwards by rectifying the Blood and Juices, ſtrengthning the Veſſels of the Womb, and reſtoring the weakned Body to its priſtine Vigour, with Alterative, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick, and Sub-aſtringent Medicaments.</p>
               <p>The Patient therefore, to prevent the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Effects that may enſue, and entirely to Cure the Whites, if ſhe is not exceeding weak indeed, muſt take a Doſe, two, or three as ſhe thinks moſt proper, or finds her ſelf able to bear, of the Purging Pills preſcrib'd in the firſt Chapter of this Book, page 6. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foregoing, taking them exactly as is there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, excepting only, that inſtead of four Pills, ſhe muſt take but three of them for a Doſe, the firſt time, becauſe Perſons afflicted with the Whites, are commonly much eaſier to be purg'd, than thoſe troubled with a Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of the Terms.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This Balſamick Electuary muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly taken till the Perſon is perfectly cur'd, which will ſoon be, provided it be taken punctually as directed; in ſome the Cure will be accompliſhed in a Fortnight, or three Weeks; but in others, whoſe Illneſs is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0202200100:61"/>bad, it may perhaps be a Month or Six Weeks before it is quite finiſhed; but its Sovereign Efficacy may be depended upon, for it will moſt certainly cure, and all Perſons will from the firſt two or three Days, apparently find themſelves mend exceedingly all the while they are taking it, which may ſerve as a Demonſtration to them, that by continuing it for a reaſonable Time, the Cure will be aſſuredly compleated.</p>
               <p>Therefore, effectually to prevent a Relapſe, I adviſe every one who begins this Balſamick Electuary, not to leave it off, notwithſtanding they may find themſelves in Nine Days or a Fortnight pretty well Cured of the Whites, but to continue taking it conſtantly as dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, for a Month, five, or ſix Weeks, which then will certainly prevent any Return of that Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>It never diſorders the Body, but commonly keeps it rather looſe than bound, is pleaſant to take, and diſplays its Virtues aſter an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Manner, effectually anſwering all the Intentions of Cure; for it ſtrengthens the Stomach and Bowels, purifies the Blood and Juices, reſtores the Womb-Veſſels to their priſtine Order, by gently ſtraitning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them to their natural Tone; it alſo wonderfully corroborates the whole Body, taking away all manner of Weakneſs in the Back, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> rendring the Patient lively, brisk, healthy and ſtrong, and perfectly putting an
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0202200100:62"/>End to that troubleſome Diſtemper, the Whites.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the Patient is under this Courſe, her Food ought to be of very eaſy Digeſtion, and if ſhe drinks a Glaſs or two of Wine at her Meals, it will be the better; ſhe muſt obſerve alſo, to avoid eating Sallets, Greens, and all ſorts of Fruit.</p>
               <p>If the Patient is troubled with the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, or is Feveriſh, then the Day before ſhe takes any Medicines, it will be highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for her to bleed in the Arm, to the Quantity of eight or nine Ounces.</p>
               <p>If ſhe is exceeding weak, and ill before ſhe begins theſe Medicines, then ſhe muſt not take the purging Pills, before recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, more than once or twice, or not at all, if ſhe thinks ſhe cannot bear Purging, but muſt begin to take the Balſamick Electuary immediately, and continue it conſtantly till ſhe is perfectly well, and indeed for a Week or Fortnight afterwards; for it will thereby ſtrengthen the Body to ſuch a Degree, and confirm the Cure of the Whites in ſuch a Manner, as re prevent any Relapſe into the ſame for the future.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Courſes, or any Sign of them approach, and indeed for two or three Days before they are expected, the Balſamick Electuary muſt be leſt off, and not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken again till the Terms have done Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0202200100:63"/>
               <p>Some Women that are very ſubject to be Coſtive, may happen to be bound in their Bodies, while they are taking the Balſamick Electuary, (tho' it moſt commonly proves otherwiſe) in which Caſe, the Patient may take a Doſe of the Laxative Electuary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in the ſecond Chapter of this Book, Page 17. a foregoing, as is there dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſo as juſt to looſen her Belly, but not more, obſerving only, to omit taking the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick Electuary that Day the Laxative One is taken.</p>
               <p>If the Patient troubled with the Whites, labours at the ſame time under any Diſorder of the Courſes, it will be proper for her firſt to get Cured of that Diſorder, as directed in the foregoing Chapters, before ſhe attempts the Cure of the Whites; as for Example, ſuppoſe a Woman ſhould be afflicted with a Deficiency of the Terms, or their flowing but ſparingly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with the Whites alſo, which frequently happens, ſhe muſt then firſt Cure her ſelf of the Deficiency of the Courſes, by taking the Opening Pouder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the firſt Chapter of this Book, p. 7. Exactly as there directed, and when by that Means her Terms flow regularly, and well, and are of a good Colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then ſhe ought to begin the Remedies preſcribed in this Chapter, for the Cure of the Whites, but not before.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0202200100:64"/>
               <p>I could give almoſt innumerable Inſtances of Perſons cured of the Whites, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Medicines above deſcribed, but ſhall only relate one or two Caſes, the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of which I believe will prove accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my Readers.</p>
               <p>I was ſent for about ſeven Months ſince to a young Gentlewoman about Nineteen Years of Age, who for three Years before, as I was informed, had at times been troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with this white Flux, but it not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtantly upon her, nor flowing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, neither her ſelf or Mother much mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, till at laſt growing very bad, the Whites increaſing in Quantity, her Legs ſwelling, and her whole Body becoming more and more diſorder'd, they thought proper to ſeek for Help.</p>
               <p>I found her in great Diſtreſs, her Back much pained, her Appetite almoſt loſt, her Legs a little ſwell'd, and the Flux (by her Mother's Relation) very ſevere, yet ſhe was not exceeding feveriſh, therefore, I did not think fit to have her blooded, but order'd her to take two Doſes of my Purging Pills before mention'd, at two Days diſtance from each other: They operated very well, took down the Swelling of her Legs, and made her ſomething better; However, being a little weakned, I did not order her to purge again, but directed her the next
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0202200100:65"/>Day to take my Balſamick Electuary as above, and continue it conſtantly till ſhe was cured.</p>
               <p>In about fourteen Days the Flux was ſo much abated, as hardly to be perceived, the Pain in her Back was nearly gone, and ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look brisk and recover Strength; but being always much ſubject to Coſtiveneſs, ſhe was ſomething bound in her Body. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore order'd her the Day following to take a Doſe of my Laxative Electuary before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, juſt to looſen her Bowels, and if ſhe found any further occaſion, to take a Doſe of it every five Days, and the Balſamick Electuary conſtantly the other Days, which ſhe did, for a Fortnight longer, in which time ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, and has remained in compleat Health ever ſince.</p>
               <p>Near ſix Months ago a Gentlewomen of about thirty Years of Age ſent for me, and deſired my Aſſiſtance, ſhe being exceedingly afflicted with the Whites, which ſhe had been troubled with upwards of four Years: That Illneſs began quickly after a Miſcarriage, which had like to have proved her Death, and which was occaſioned by a great Fright.</p>
               <p>She told me ſhe had taken abundance of Medicines, firſt by the Advice of her Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, and an eminent Apothecary, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the Direction of a Phyſician of good Note, without receiving any Benefit; and added, that ſhe feared there was no Cure for her, but that ſhe muſt dye, yet deſired
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0202200100:66"/>I would do all in my Power, and ſave her Life, if poſſible, for her Children's Sake, ſhe having three alive.</p>
               <p>Her Caſe was exceeding bad indeed; ſhe was very ill and weak, ſcarce able to ſtir, had a violent Pain in her Head and Back, no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to Food, was frequently very feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and almoſt wore to a Skeleton by the great Flux of white Matter that ſhe had ſo long labour'd under, nevertheleſs I let her know, that with the Bleſſing of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I did not doubt but to reſtore her to Health, provided ſhe would follow my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and take my Medicines punctually, which ſhe readily promiſed to do.</p>
               <p>This Gentlewoman was too weak to bear Purging, therefore I forbore ordering her my Purging Pills; but conſidering the great Pain in her Head, and that ſhe was inclined to be feveriſh, I directed her, firſt, to have about eight Ounces of Blood taken from her Arm, which without weakning her, diverted the Humours, and prevented a Fever, which might otherwiſe have happen'd, and the next Day, I ordered her to begin my Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Electuary, and continue it conſtantly, as directed in this Chapter,</p>
               <p>At the End of Five Days, I found her mightily recover'd, the Whites being nearly ſtopt, her Spirits revived, her Strength much encreasd, the Pain in her Head and Back almoſt entirely gone, and her Appetite in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0202200100:67"/>come to her: However, ſhe being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hot and uneaſy by turns, and not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purged at firſt, becauſe of her exceeding Weakneſs, I adviſed her: though ſhe was not in the leaſt Coſtive, to take a Doſe of my Laxative Electuary, once every Five or Six Days, and the Balſamick Electuary the other Days, as before, and to continue that Courſe till ſhe was perfectly well, and for Nine or Ten Days after.</p>
               <p>Accordingly ſhe took my Advice, and in a Month from the Time ſhe firſt began my Medicines, ſhe left off taking them, having been well for about a Week before, and was then, and ſtill remains in perfect Health and Strength, to the Admiration of all that knew her.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Bownfalling of the Womb and Fundament.</head>
               <p>WHAT is vulgarly call'd the Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling of the Womb, is in Reallity no ſuch Thing, for there can be no Out-hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of That, without preſent Death; but the Diſorder commonly known by that Name, is an Out-hanging of the Vagina, or outer Neck of the Womb, and is truly only the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0202200100:68"/>Wrinkles of the Sheath, or Paſſage relaxed and ſwoln, ſo as to fall cut and appear, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a Ball with a Hole in the Middle: It is generally very painful and troubleſome, and ſometimes ſo much inflamed, as to threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a Gangrene.</p>
               <p>This Indiſpoſition is cauſed by ſtraining or irritating the Secret Parts, by hard Labour in Child-bearing, by the Hand of an unskilful Midwife, by exceſſive Venery, or immoderate Exerciſe, as hard Riding, Dancing, Leaping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by a violent Flux, either of the Whites or Courſes, which often not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxes, or looſens the Vagina, but alſo frets or irritates it ſo, as to cauſe it to become ſore, ſwell and hang down.</p>
               <p>The Falling down of the Fundament is an Out hanging of the Inteſtinum Rectum, or great Gut, and is cauſed by Weakneſs and Relaxation of its Fibres, or tearing of them, either by ſevere Coſtiveneſs, violent ſtraining in hard Labour, or ſharp Looſeneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not only troubleſome but dangerous, if not quickly remedied, and oftentimes becomes the Seat of a foul Ulcer or Fiſtula.</p>
               <p>In the Cure of theſe Illneſſes, the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that we give inwardly, muſt be Vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and ſuch as will endue the Blood and Juices with a Balſamick Property, in order to ſtrengthen and create an Aptneſs in the relaxed Fibres, and ſwoln Parts to recover their Tone, and retain their natural Station,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0202200100:69"/>when reduced, or gently put up, after peculiar Emollient, and moderately Aſtringent Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations have been externally applied.</p>
               <p>If the Patient is coſtive, particular Care muſt be had to remove that Diſorder, for ſtraining at going to Stool is not only painful, but increaſes the Malady, as well that of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of the Womb, as the falling down of the Fundament.</p>
               <p>If the Part hanging down is inflamed or angry, Bleeding in the Arm will be abſolutely neceſſary, after which, in order certainly to cure theſe Indiſpoſitions, the Parts affected muſt be bathed outwardly with my ſanative Fomentation, which is thus made.

               </p>
               <p>This Sanative Fomentation muſt be uſed thus; Pour a little of it into a well glaz'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0202200100:70"/>Pipkin, or other Earthen Veſſel, and make it very hot over the Fire, then with a fine Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Cloth dipt into it, bathe and foment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Part hanging out, either of the Fundament or Womb, as hot as can be well endured, for a quarter or half an Hour toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; after which, the Patient lying down, let the Part be gently put up by a tender Hand, and kept in its Place by a Truſs, or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Bands of Linnen Cloth, minding to bathe thoſe Parts two or three times every Day in the ſame manner, for five or ſix Days together, though the Part does not fall out again.</p>
               <p>By the uſe of this Fomentation alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking Medicines inwardly, the falling down of the Womb will be aſſuredly cured; but in the falling down of the Fundament, eſpecially if it be through great Weakneſs, it will be very neceſſary for the Patient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides bathing the Part affected with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Fomentation, to take at the ſame time the Balſamick Electuary preſcribed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, <hi>Page</hi> 44. as is there directed, and it will wonderfully ſtrengthen the Parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilſt the Sanative Fomentation uſed outwardly, will abate the Swelling, heal all Soreneſs, cauſe the relaxed Fibres to regain their Tone, and keep the Part affected in its Natural Situation.</p>
               <p>But if the Patient is Coſtive and the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick Electuary ſhould not cauſe looſe Stools, as it generally will, then the Lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0202200100:71"/>Electuary, preſcribed in the ſecond Chapter, Page 17. aforegoing, muſt be taken, as there directed, in a Morning Faſting, every third, fourth or fifth Day, as the Patient finds needful; taking ſuch a Doſe of it as will juſt give two or three looſe Stools, but not more, and minding to omit the Balſamick Electuary that Day the Laxative One is taken.</p>
               <p>It will be convenient alſo for thoſe troubled with the down falling of the Womb, if they are Coſtive, to take the Laxative Electuary in like manner.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe Directions being punctually followed, the falling down of the Womb, (as it is vulgarly called) and alſo of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will be certainly and effectually Cured.</p>

               <p>AS being the Mother of Children is the higheſt Honour, and moſt exalted State of Satisfaction, that the Fair Sex can attain to in a Married Life; ſo on the contrary Barrenneſs, of all other Misfortunes is by much the greateſt, producing the moſt ſevere Affliction that can attend a Family, and cauſing the deepeſt ſecret Grief in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is poſſible to be imagined: What Diſcord? What Differences are bred in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0202200100:72"/>of the beſt Families for want of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to crown the earneſt Deſires of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons? And what Reproaches and melancholly Reflections that want often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, with the diſmal Diſorders that from thence frequently ariſe, may be eaſily conceived by Judicious Perſons, who will give themſelves liberty to conſider how great the Sorrow of that Woman muſt be, who knows, that could ſhe have Children; ſhe ſhould be abſolutely happy in a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried State, when for want of them ſhe is perhaps treated with Ignomy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and made the moſt unfortunate of her Sex.</p>
               <p>This being true, it Naturally follows, that nothing is more neceſſary than to treat of, and faithfully diſcover, the Cauſes and Cure of Barrenneſs in Women, when it is done, with a real Intent of being ſerviceable to the World, in rendering ſuch a conſiderable Number of the Fair Sex fruitful and happy, who, with the laſt degree of Sorrow, now labour under the ingrateful Imputation of being Barren.</p>
               <p>And the more uſeful will it ſtill appear, when we conſider that the Natural Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Modeſty of our Women, hinder them from openly ſeeking for a Cure of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Circumſtance, which, by means of the plain modeſt Account I intend to give, may be ſecretly remedied by themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Knowledge of others.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0202200100:73"/>
               <p>It is to be underſtood here, that I mean to write only of the Cauſe and Cure of Barrenneſs in Women of ſuitable Years, and not in thoſe who are either too old, or too young; in the former, when their Terms have left them, Conception is impoſſible, and the latter muſt contentedly wait, till Age has ripen'd, and made them capable of Child-bearing; for ſome Women there are, who being Married very young, Conceive not till they are Nineteen, Twenty or Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two or three Years of Age, or more, and then become very Fruitful; and others that. Marrying betimes have Children at Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or Fifteen: Thus there is a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and manifeſt Difference in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Ripeneſs of the Female Sex. This being premiſed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall firſt ſhew the ſeveral Cauſes of Barrenneſs, and here by the way I cannot paſs by, what with Concern I have often obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> That many likely Women have been deemed incurably Barren, lived uncomfortably many Years, and at laſt gone out of the World without bearing Children, for want only of their Phyſician's having a true Knowledge of the ſeemingly unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Cauſe, which in all probability might have been eaſily removed by a proper Method and fit Medicines, and the Women have been rendered as capable of having Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as any whatever; but to proceed.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0202200100:74"/>
               <p>The Cauſes of Barrenneſs are many, as the viſible ill Structure or Formation of the Parts, exceeding Fatneſs, Scirrhous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours or Swellings in the Neck of the Womb, Ulcers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all which Caſes there cannot be a regular Admiſſion of the Male Seed, ſo that it is impoſſible a Conception ſhould happen; but as theſe Cauſes are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeen, and as rarely Cured, I ſhall not enlarge upon them. Other Cauſes of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs are,
<list>
                     <item>I. The Deficiency of the Monthly Terms, and then the Natural Ferment of the Blood and Juices is wanting, the lively, deſirous Faculty is ſpoiled, neither is the Womb fit to receive the Spirituous Effluvia of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Seed that a Conception might follow.</item>
                     <item>II. The immoderate Flux of the Courſes, which impoveriſhes the Fluids, weakens the whole Body, and thereby incapacitates a Woman to Conceive.</item>
                     <item>III. The Whites, Slipperineſs, or over Moiſtneſs of the Womb, which weaken it and its Veſſels, plainly prevent Conception, by condenſing or drowning, as it were, the Vital Spirits of the Male Seed, and by that means cauſing Sterility.</item>
                     <item>IV. The Swelling of the Vagina, or Wrinkles of the Privities, ſo as to hang out of the Body, vulgarly called the Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling of the Womb, which then hinders Enjoyment.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0202200100:75"/>
               <p>But there are yet other Cauſes of barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that are not viſible, the Women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in perfect Health, Young, Brisk, Jolly, and as likely to have Children to all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and as they themſelves believe, as any in the World, and by reaſon the Cauſes of Sterility in ſuch Women do not immediately appear, the Vulgar Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners call them occult, or unknown, and indeed are ſo to them; but to an Ingenious Phyſician, who makes Nature his Study, is expert in Anatomy, and who carefully ſearches into the Abſtruſe Principles and Cauſes of Things, to ſuch, theſe pretended occult Cauſes are well known, eaſily account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and quickly removed, and which I will unfold.</p>
               <p>But firſt it will be neceſſary, in order to explain and fully lay open what may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appear intricate, to Women and others in treating of theſe Cauſes, to ſhew the Nature of Generation, and how a Foetus is produced.</p>
               <p>Within the Body of a Woman, on each ſide the outer Part of the Bottom of the Womb, at about eight Fingers Breadth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from it, are ſituated the Ovaria, ſo named from their Likeneſs to the Collection of little Eggs found in the Bodies of Fowl; theſe Ovaria are of an Oval Figure, a little flat on their upper Part, and about half as big as a Man's Teſticles, and are vulgarly called Teſticles or Stones.</p>

               <p>In the Ovaria there are ſeveral little Ova or Eggs, almoſt like Bladders, contain'd in proper ſeparate Cells, one of which Eggs in the time of Coition is foecundated or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated by the Spirituous Part or Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium of the Male Seed caſt to the Womb, which Spirit or Effluvium aſcends from thence to the Ovaria through the Veſſels called Womb Trumpets, which are about four or five Fingers breadth long, and ariſe on each ſide from the Bottom of the Womb; the upper Part of theſe Womb Trumpets, being wide and open, embrace the Ovaria in the time of Enjoyment, and dilate or open ſo as to give free Paſſage to the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvium, or Spirit of the Maſculine Seed caſt to the Womb, that it may inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrive at the Ovaria, where it ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, acts upon, and impregnates one of the little Ova or Eggs therein contain'd, as before mentioned; which then falls from its Cell, through one of the Womb Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, into the Womb, as a proper Place aſſigned by Nature for its Reception; where it is nouriſhed, grows bigger, and becomes a Foetus.</p>
               <p>If two or more of theſe little Eggs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be foecundated, or impregnated at the ſame time, the Woman then has Twins, or ſeveral Children at a Birth, as is often ſeen.</p>
               <p>The falling of one of the little Eggs from its Cell in the Ovaria, through one of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0202200100:77"/>Womb Trumpets, into the Womb, often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions an uncommon Senſation and gentle ſhivering of the Body after the Conjugal Act, which is therefore a Sign of Conception; it alſo cauſes a Contraction of the inner Neck or Mouth of the Womb, ſo as perfectly to cloſe it, in order to retain the Egg in the Womb, and prevent its ſlipping away, till at the end of nine Months, the time allotted for its Perfection and Birth, it is become Ripe for Expulſion, and fit to live in the open Air.</p>
               <p>And thus Conception is cauſed, and not by the fancied, true and equal mixture of Male and Female Seed, as was the Notion of the Ancients; for Women have no ſuch thing as Seed other than the Ovaria, vulgarly called Teſticles, before deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Indeed in the time of Coition moſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men void a white limpid Humour, which having ſome reſemblance to Seed, might help to occaſion the Miſtake of the Ancients; but modern Diſcoveries demonſtrate, that this white Liquor comes from the ſmall Pores of the Vagina celled Lacunae, and not from the Womb, neither in the time of Carnal Conjunction does it go into the Womb, which is a plain Proof that it is not Seed, but that it is only deſigned by Nature to create Deſire in Women, lubricate the Paſſage to the Womb, and to cauſe exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pleaſure in the Conjugal Act.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0202200100:78"/>
               <p>Now it muſt be allow'd, that it is moſt likely a Woman ſhould Conceive at the Moment this white Liqour is voided, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Male Seed is at that inſtant emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo, becauſe then the Woman feels ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Delight, which occaſions the Mouth of the Womb to open and receive the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Part of the Maſculine Seed, the Womb Trumpets alſo dilate or widen to ſuch a degree, as to give Paſſage to the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Egg, which when impregnated falls from its Cell in the Ovaria, through one of them into the Womb, as before taught.</p>
               <p>And thus having diſcover'd how Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Conception happens, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to treat of the Cauſes of Barrenneſs, which do not plainly appear, and are not known to Women themſelves, which now from what follows may be eaſily conceived by Perſons of tollerable Senſe and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The Cauſes then that hinder Conception in Women of ſuitable Years, brisk, and not labouring under any Apparent Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Indiſpoſition, muſt be either an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Womb Trumpets, which then hinders the Spirituous Part of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Seed from paſſing through them to the Ovaria, without which Impregnation or Conception cannot happen; or from the Faultineſs of the Ova or Eggs contain'd in the Ovaria, ſo as they are uncapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impregnated by the Vital Effluvia of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0202200100:79"/>Male Seed, that Conception might follow; or elſe from an inappitency to Matrimonial Pleaſure in general, which laſt is common to Women of a Cold Conſtitution, in whom the Spirits flow not to the lower Parts, they feel no Pleaſure in Coition, the Womb con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, its inner Neck cloſes, and for want of warm Deſires in the mind, gives not, but refuſes a ſuitable Reception to the Effluvia of the Male Seed, and ſo abſolutely hinders Conception.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſhewn the Cauſes of Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well thoſe that are deemed occult, or unknown, as thoſe that are obvious to common Practitioners and Women them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I ſhall in the next Place point out the true and direct method of Cure.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, if Conception be hindred by Diſeaſes, as the Deficiency or want of the Courſes, immoderate flowing of the Terms, the Whites, Slipperineſs of the Womb, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanging or bearing down of the ſwell'd Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then recourſe muſt be immediately had to the method and Medicines appointed for their Cure, under their proper Heads in the 'foregoing Chapters, and when the Patient is thereby brought into good Order, has her Courſes regular, and her Body is in an apparent, healthy State, then, if ſhe does not quickly Conceive, muſt be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred proper Uterine Medicines, Cordial and Strengthning, and which have a peculiar
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0202200100:80"/>Faculty to prepare, fortify and invigorate the Parts appropriated to Generation, and make a Woman Prolifick, of which Nature are the Medicaments I ſhall by and by preſcribe.</p>
               <p>Now when Barrenneſs proceeds from Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or Stoppage of the Womb Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, or from the Faultineſs of the Ova or Eggs in the Ovaria, (which Cauſes) do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear otherwiſe than in their Effect) or from defect or want of convenient Amorous Deſire, then, and in all theſe Caſes, Endeavours muſt be uſed to attenuate the Blood and Juices, rouſe and encreaſe the Animal Spirits, cauſe them to act with Ardour, to revive the whole Humane Frame, and create Mirth, and particularly to rectify all Diſorders of the Genital Parts, by ſuch Salubrious Medicines, as are ſpecificated to open Obſtructions of the Womb Trumpets, and at the ſame time adapted to comfort and ſtrengthen the whole Body, nouriſh, encreaſe and fill the Ova or Eggs in the Ovaria, make them apt and ready to be foecundated or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated and alſo to correct and drive away the Saturnine Habit, and all ſupper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, cold, moiſt Humours, which deaden Deſires to Matrimonial Pleaſure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deſtroy even the very intent of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, ſuch Medicines I ſay muſt be given, as will repleniſh the Blood and Juices, and revive an Inclination to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Enjoyment, ſo that it may no more be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0202200100:81"/>burdenſome, as it is to ſome Women, but ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably acceptable, that thereby happy Iſſue may be the Conſequence.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place therefore, thoſe who have reaſon to believe their not Conceiving proceeds from the 'foremention'd, occult, unknown, or not apparent Cauſes, muſt take the following Prolifick Elixir, which will open any Stoppage or Obſtruction of the Womb Trumpets, fit and prepare the Ova or Eggs for Impregnation, rectify the Blood and Juices, and correct all Vicious Qualities thereof.

               <p>While I was writing this Chapter, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman came to return me Thanks and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify me for the Service I had done his Lady. The Caſe was this: About ſix Months ago he acquainted me that he had been married to a brisk handſome young Woman above five Years, without having any Children, or her being once with Child, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd great Sorrow to them both, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Contention between them, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman alledging that it was not his Fault, and the Lady being as Confident, which from all outward Appearance ſhe might, that it was not hers: After he had inform'd me of the whole Matter, I concluded, that his Wife's not Conceiving was occaſioned by Obſtruction, or narrowneſs of the Womb Trumpets, and therefore gave him a Bottle
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0202200100:86"/>of my Prolifick Elixir (which I believed would render her Fruitful) with Direction for her to take it for a Fortnight or three Weeks conſtantly, as I have order'd in this Chapter, which he perſuaded her to, and ſhe Conceived quickly after, being now, to her great Joy, as well as her Husband's, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four Months gone with Child.</p>
               <p>Another Gentleman (near three Quarters of a Year ſince) let me know, that he had been Married pear ſeven Years without having Children, and that his Wife, being of a Cold Conſtitution, he believed that was the Cauſe of her not Conceiving, which was my Opinion alſo. I therefore order'd her my Powerful Confect to be taken for a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night together or more, as I have directed in this Chapter, which ſhe took, and without uſing my Stimulating Balm, it had ſuch Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that ſhe quickly Conceived, and is now near the Time of her Delivery.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of Miſcarriage, with Directions how to cauſe ſpeedy Delivery in Child-Birth, and alſo how to rectify the Diſorders of the Lochia, or Child-Bed Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</head>
               <p>AS there is nothing more unpleaſing than to be diſappointed of expected and wiſh'd for Iſſue, through Miſcarriage, ſo nothing proves more dangerous to the Female Sex, than that unhappy misfortune; for it being Unnatural, is always attended with ill Symptoms, and proves much worſe than a regular Child-birth: And tho' a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man recovers the immediate Danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her Life by a Miſcarriage, yet if ſhe is frequently afflicted in the ſame manner, it certainly ruins her Conſtitution, weakens the whole Body, brings on incurable Illneſſes, and neceſſarily ſhortens Life.</p>
               <p>And it is a Grievance that often becomes habitual to the Fair Sex, many Women Miſcarrying five or ſix, and ſome, ten or twelve times following one another, exactly at a certain Length of Time after Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Thus Miſcarriage happens, to ſome
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0202200100:88"/>always in the third Month of their going with Child, to others in the fourth, fifth, ſixth, ſeventh or eighth, and then it is much more dangerous than in the firſt two or three Months.</p>
               <p>The oftner a Woman has miſcarried, the more difficult will it be to cauſe her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Fruit of her Womb, the whole nine Months that Divine Providence has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for ripening a Natural Birth; for when a Woman is accuſtom'd to miſcarry, the Womb at the uſual time endeavours with its utmoſt Efforts to eject its Burden.</p>
               <p>Miſcarriage is commonly cauſed the firſt time by a ſudden Fright, violent Blow, or Fall, or longing for Things ſeen without having them, either of which, cauſes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Womb, and a kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Motion, ſo as to expel the Foetus. In a word, whatever irritates the Womb, and excites the Expulſive, and weakens the Retentive Faculty, procures Miſcarriage; ſo that a great Cold, immoderate Exerciſe, intemperate Eating, Drinking too much Wine in the firſt Months, exceſſive Paſſion, either of Anger, Joy, Fear, Grief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or diſorder of the Kidneys, or of the Bowels, the redundancy and rarefaction of the Blood, flaggineſs of the Womb, want of Spirits through prodigious Bleedings, alſo vehement Coughing, Sneezing, or Vomiting, may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion this great Unhappineſs.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0202200100:89"/>
               <p>The imminent Symptoms that threaten immediate Miſcarriage, are an heavineſs and weight about the Loins, a bearing down of the Womb, Pain of the Back, and Pains from the Navel downwards, alſo trembling, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation of the Heart, ſhivering, inappetency, lazineſs, flaggineſs of the Breaſts, flux of Matter from the Womb, <hi>&amp;c</hi> all, or any of which, portend Miſcarriage.</p>
               <p>If there is Reaſon to believe, that the Foetus is already ſeparated from the Womb, the Expulſion of it muſt not be hindred, but, on the contrary, be promoted as much as may be, by the Aſſiſtance of a Skilful Midwife or Phyſician practiſing that Art; and ſuch Remedies muſt be given as will haſten its Expulſion, and by their forcing Quality, ſpeedily Eaſe the Womb of its then dangerous Burden; for which end I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the following Expulſive Cordial, a Spoonful or two of which, the Patient muſt take every now and then, firſt ſhaking the Bottle, and it will cauſe the Womb to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Foetus or Child, tho' Dead, with admirable and unexpected Eaſe.</p>
               <p>For which reaſon it is alſo wonderfully ſerviceable to thoſe in Labour, who have gone out their whole Time; for being taken as before directed, when the Pains relent, or are weak, it brings them on kindly, and cauſes a ſpeedy and eaſy Delivery.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0202200100:91"/>hurt than good, and prove dangerous, and therefore muſt be avoided, till by the Hand of a Skilful Midwife the Birth is made to preſent right, and then the Expulſive Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial being given as before directed, will ſoon diſplay its wonderful Efficacy, and ſpeedily cauſe an happy Delivery.</p>
               <p>And if after Delivery, the Lochia or Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Purgations doe not come down regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, then a Spoonful or two of the Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Cordial, being given to the Patient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Diſcretion of her Midwife, will prove very ſerviceable, and bring down the Flux freely.</p>
               <p>But to return to Miſcarriage: If the Foetus or Child be not ſeparated, nor the Blood Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels broke, Endeavours, by all poſſible means, muſt then be uſed to confirm the Tone of the Ligaments, ſtrengthen the Womb, and corroborate the Foetus; for which purpoſe ſuch Medicines muſt be immediately given, as are Comforting, Balſamick, Sub-aſtringent, Temperate in reſpect to Heat, and that have a Power to abſorb all irritating or ſharp Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which often cauſe a Contraction of the Womb and Expulſion of the Birth.</p>
               <p>Therefore if a Woman has, never miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but, being with Child, is frightned, or receives a Blow, Fall, <hi>&amp;c</hi> ſo as to endanger a Miſcarriage, I adviſe her, inſtantly to drink a Glaſs, two, or more of ſtrong <hi>Florence</hi> or <hi>Barabar</hi> Claret, there being nothing better
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0202200100:92"/>on thoſe Occaſions; for it recovers and raiſes the Spirits depreſſed by Frights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and at the ſame time by its Noble Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Quality, ſtrengthens the Womb and its Veſſels; Burnt-Claret may alſo be drank to good Effect: After which, if any Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of Miſcarrying continue; the Patient muſt take from the Point of a Knife, the quantity of a large Nutmeg of my Specifick Electuary, preſcribed for the immoderate Flux of the Courſes in the ſecond Chapter of this Book, Page 19. a foregoing, as ſoon as can be, and continue to take the ſame quantity of it three times every Day, <hi>viz.</hi> every Night and Morning, and at three or four a Clock every Afternoon, till all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Miſcarrying is over, minding to drink a Glaſs of the aforemention'd Wine or other agreeable Liquor after each Doſe, and it will aſſuredly prevent Miſcarriage.</p>
               <p>But if the Patient has Miſcarried once, or ſeveral times before, then it will be highly neceſſary for her to begin to take the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Electuary, as before directed, a Week or more, before the laſt or uſual time of her Miſcarrying, and continue it till a Week or Fortnight after the time ſhe moſt fears, tho' ſhe has no Symptoms of Miſcarrying, by which means ſhe will certainly prevent that misfortune, tho' ſhe has miſcarried many times before.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0202200100:93"/>
               <p>For it powerfully corroborates the Womb and its Veſſels, confirms and eſtabliſhes the Tone of the Ligaments that keep the Birth fixed to the Womb, and ſtrengthens the Foetus more than can be expreſſed; it alſo comforts the Stomach and Bowels, abſorbs all acrid or ſharp Humours, and fortifies the Spirits exceedingly: Therefore the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it is taken, during a Woman is with Child, the more ſecure will ſhe be of going out her whole Time with ſafety, eaſe and health; yet about the laſt Month of her Time, if no danger of Miſcarrying appears, it will be proper for her to leave taking it, becauſe it ſtrengthens the Membranes, Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Veſſels ſo exceedingly, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken too near the Time of Delivery, it may poſſibly cauſe her Labour to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more hard than otherwiſe it would.</p>
               <p>If after a Woman is brought to Bed, the Lochia or Child-bed Purgations ſhould flow violently, ſo as to make it neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Flux, then a few Doſes of the Specifick Electuary, being given to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent by Advice of her Midwife, will do infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Good.</p>
               <p>If the Patient, during the time of taking the Specifick Electuary, to prevent her Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying, ſhould happen to he Coſtive, or very hard Bound, then it will be neceſſary for her to take ſome very gentle Medicine, juſt to looſen her Belly every now and then, as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0202200100:94"/>ſhe finds occaſion, for which purpoſe a ſmall Doſe of the Laxative Electuary preſcrib'd in this Book, Page 17. aforegoing, being taken, will prove very proper.</p>
               <p>If the Symptoms of Miſcarriage are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by longing for Things ſeen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, they ought immediately to be procured, if poſſible.</p>
               <p>And if the Patient is of a Sanguine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and full of Blood, it will not be amiſs for her to be preſently blooded to the quantity of eight Ounces.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given all the neceſſary Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions concerning Miſcarriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being duly followed, will certainly have the deſired Effect; as the number of Women I have cured of the Habit of Miſcarrying, by the Method herein ſet down, evinces.</p>
               <p>About two Years ago, a Gentlewoman near thirty Years of Age came to me much afflicted, having miſcarried ten times before, and always about the third Month; ſhe was very deſirous to be cured of that Faculty, and was then about nine or tea Weeks gone with Child, and began to have ſome Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of approaching Miſcarriage, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore order'd her to take my Specifick Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, as I have directed in this Chapter, and to continue it constantly for ſix Weeks at leaſt, which ſhe did, and without taking any think elſe, ſhe was cured, went out her whole Time, and brought into the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0202200100:95"/>World a healthy Boy; and ſo compleat was the Cure, that ſince that, ſhe has had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Child, without taking any Medicines, or having the leaſt ſign or fear of Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> It being a common thing for Women who are afflicted with Illneſs to leave off taking Medicines, after the worſt Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of their Indiſpoſitions are taken off, and before they are perfectly Cured, I could not here omit adviſing them, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void that Practice, and to keep to the Courſe of Medicines that they enter into, regularly, for the whole time they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, otherwiſe they cannot expect leſs than to relapſe into their Diſeaſes again, which will then give them double Trouble, increaſe the Expence, and prove more difficult to Cure.</p>
