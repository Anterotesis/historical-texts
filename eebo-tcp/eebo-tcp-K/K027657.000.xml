            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE foul and infamous traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic, between diſhoneſt book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers and profligate ſcribblers, which has ſubſiſted for more than a century, has juſtly brought poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humous publications under ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, in England, France, and more eſpecially in Holland: miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſtate in every European court, great generals, royal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, authors of eſtabliſhed repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in a word, all ſuch as have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0851700400:6"/>
had the misfortune to advance themſelves to eminence, have been obliged to leave behind them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of letters, and other memoirs, of the moſt ſecret and important tranſactions of their times, in which every fact, beyond the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a news-paper or coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe chat is ſo faithfully miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, every character delineated with ſuch punctual deviation from the truth, and cauſes and effects which have no poſſible relation, are with ſuch amazing effrontery obtruded upon the public, that it is no wonder if men of ſenſe, who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0851700400:7"/>
read for inſtruction as well as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, generally condemn them in the lump, never, or very rarely, affording them the honour of a peruſal—The publiſher of theſe letters, however, has not the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt apprehenſion that any part of this well grounded cenſure can fall to his ſhare; he deals not in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing events to aſtoniſh the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nor in characters (one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) which have figured on the great theatre of the world; he purpoſely waves all proofs which might be drawn concerning their authenticity, from the character of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0851700400:8"/>
the gentleman who had the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the originals, and, with Eliza's permiſſion, faithfully copied them at Bombay in the Eaſt Indies; from the teſtimony of many reſpectable families in this city, who knew and loved Eliza, careſſed and admired Mr. Sterne, and were well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the tender friendſhip between them, from many curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anecdotes in the letters themſelves, any one of which were fully ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to authenticate them, and ſubmits his reputation to the taſte and diſcernment of the commoneſt reader, who muſt, in one view, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0851700400:9"/>
that theſe letters are genuine, beyond any poſſibility of doubt—As the public is unqueſtionably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to every kind of information concerning the characters contained in theſe letters, which conſiſts with the duties of humanity and a good citizen, that is, a minute acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with thoſe of whom honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mention is made, or the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher is furniſhed with authorities to vindicate from Mr. Sterne's cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which, as a man of warm temper and lively imagination, he was perhaps ſometimes hurried into without due reflection, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0851700400:10"/>
himſelf that no party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned will or can be offended with this publication, eſpecially if it is conſidered, that without ſuch infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation it would be cold and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting; that by publiſhing their merits he cannot be underſtood to intend them any injury, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it would himſelf fail in his duty to the public—Eliza, the lady to whom theſe letters are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, is Mrs. Elizabeth Draper, wife of Daniel Draper, Eſq. coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor at Bombay, and at preſent chief of the Engliſh factory at Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, a gentleman very highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0851700400:11"/>
in that quarter of the globe—She is by birth an Eaſt Indian; but the circumſtance of being born in the country not proving ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to defend her delicate frame againſt the heats of that burning climate, ſhe came to England for the recovery of her health, when by accident ſhe became acquainted with Mr. Sterne. He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately diſcovered in her a mind ſo congenial with his own, ſo enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, ſo refined, and ſo tender, that their mutual attraction preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joined them in the cloſeſt union that purity could poſſibly admit of;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0851700400:12"/>
he loved her as his friend, and prid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her as his pupil; all her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns became preſently his; her health, her circumſtances, her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, her children were his; his fortune, his time, his country were at her diſpoſal, ſo far as the ſacrifice of all or any of theſe might in his opinion contribute to her real happineſs. If it is aſked whether the glowing heat of Mr. Sterne's affection never tranſported him to a flight beyond the limits of pure platoniſm, the publiſher will not take upon him abſolutely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it; but this he thinks ſo far from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0851700400:13"/>
leaving any ſtain upon that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's memory, that it perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his faireſt encomium, ſince to cheriſh the ſeeds of piety and chaſtity in a heart which the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are intereſted to corrupt, muſt be allowed to be the nobleſt effort of a ſoul, fraught and fortified with the juſteſt ſentiments of Religion and Virtue—Mr. and Mrs. James, ſo frequently and honourably men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in theſe letters, are the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy heads of an opulent family in this city; their character is too well eſtabliſhed to need the aid of the publiſher in ſecuring the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0851700400:14"/>
they ſo well deſerve and univerſally poſſeſs, yet he cannot reſtrain one obſervation; that to have been reſpected and beloved by Mr. Sterne and Mrs. Draper is no inconſiderable teſtimony of their merit, and ſuch as it cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to them to ſee publiſhed to the world—Miſs Light, now Mrs. Stratton, is on all accounts a very amiable young lady—She was acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally a paſſenger in the ſame ſhip with Eliza, and inſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged her friendſhip and eſteem, but being mentioned in one of Mrs. Draper's letters to Mr. Sterne, in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0851700400:15"/>
ſomewhat of a comparative manner with herſelf, his partiality for her, as ſhe modeſtly expreſſed it, took the alarm, and betrayed him into ſome expreſſions, the coarſeneſs of which cannot be excuſed. Mrs. Draper declares, that this lady was entirely unknown to him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſuperior to his idea of her: ſhe has been lately married to George Stratton, Eſq. Counſellor at Madraſs—The manner in which Mr. Sterne's acquaintance with the celebrated Lord Bathurſt, the friend and companion of Addiſon, Swift, Pope, Steele, and all the fineſt wits of the laſt age, commenced,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0851700400:16"/>
cannot fail to attract the attention of the curious reader: here that great man is ſocial and unreſerved, unſhackled with that ſedulity in ſupporting a feigned character which expoſes moſt of his rank to the contempt of wiſe men, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule of their valets de chambre; here he appears the ſame as in his hours of feſtivity and happineſs with Swift and Addiſon, ſuperior to forms and ceremonies, and, in his eighty-fifth year, abounding in wit, vivacity and humanity: me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the pleaſure of ſuch a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's acquaintance reſembles that of converſing with ſuperior
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0851700400:17"/>
beings; but it is not fit to dwell longer on this pleaſing topic, leaſt it ſhould anticipate the reader's pleaſure in peruſing the letter itſelf: one remark however it ſuggeſts, which may be uſeful to old men in general, to wit, that it appears, by his lordſhip's example, the ſour contracted ſpirit obſervable in old age, is not ſpecifically an effect of years, altho' they are commonly pleaded in it's excuſe. Old men would therefore do well to correct this odious quality in themſelves; or, if that muſt not be, to invent a better apology for it—It is very much to be lamented, that Eliza's
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0851700400:18"/>
modeſty was invincible to all the publiſher's endeavours to obtain her anſwers to theſe letters: her wit, penetration and judgment, her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the epiſtolary ſtile, ſo rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turouſly commended by Mr. Sterne, could not fail to furniſh a rich en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment for the public. The publiſher could not help telling her, that he wiſhed to God ſhe really was poſſeſſed of that vanity with which ſhe was charged; to which ſhe replied, that ſhe was ſo far from acquitting herſelf of vanity, that ſhe ſuſpected that to be the cauſe why ſhe could not prevail on her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſubmit her letters to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0851700400:19"/>
public eye; for altho' Mr. Sterne was partial to every thing of her's, ſhe could not hope that the world would be ſo too: with this anſwer he was oblig'd to be contented; yet cannot reflect without deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that this elegant accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo peculiarly adapted to the refined and delicate underſtandings of ladies, ſhould be yet ſo rare that we can boaſt of only one lady Wortley Montague among us, and that Eliza in particular could not be prevailed on to follow the example of that admired Lady—The reader will remark, that theſe letters have various ſignatures, ſometimes he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0851700400:20"/>
ſigns Sterne, ſometimes Yorick, and to one or two he ſigns her Bramin; altho' it is pretty gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known who the Bramins are, yet leaſt any body ſhould be at a loſs, it may not be amiſs to obſerve, that the principal caſt or tribe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the idolatrous Indians are the Bramins, and out of the chief claſs of this caſt come the prieſts, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their auſterities, and the ſhocking torments, and frequently death, they voluntarily expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to, on a religious account: now, as Mr. Sterne was a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Eliza an Indian by birth, it was cuſtomary with her to call
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0851700400:21"/>
him her Bramin, which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, in his pleaſant moods, uſes as a ſignature—It remains only, to take ſome little notice of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily marked with aſteriſks, on whom Mr. Sterne has thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſhed the bittereſt gall of his pen; it is however evident, even from ſome paſſages in the letters themſelves, that Mrs. Draper could not be eaſily prevailed on to ſee this family in the ſame odious light in which they appeared to her, perhaps over zealous, friend. He, in the heat, or I may ſay, hurry of his affection, might have accepted ſuſpicious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as real evidences of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0851700400:22"/>
guilt, or liſtened too unguardedly to the inſinuations of their enemies: be that as it may, as the publiſher is not furniſhed with ſufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities to exculpate them, he chuſes to drop the ungrateful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, heartily wiſhing, that this family may not only be innocent of the ſhocking treachery with which they are charged, but may be able to make their innocence appear clearly to the world, otherwiſe that no perſon may be induſtrious enough to diſcover and make known their name.</p>

This nobleman is an old friend of mine. You know he was always the protector of men of wit and genius, and had thoſe of the laſt century, Addiſon, Steele, Pope, Swift, Prior, &amp;c. &amp;c. always at his table.—</p>
            <p>The manner in which his notice of me began, was ſingular, as it was polite: he came up to me one day, as I was at the Princeſs of Wales's court—<q rend="inline">"I want to know you, Mr. S<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0851700400:29"/>
with genius's of that caſt, but have ſurviv'd them; and deſpairing ever to find their equals, 'tis ſome years ſince I clos'd my accounts, and ſhut up my books, with thoughts of never opening them again: But you have kindled a deſire in me to open them once more before I die, which I now do—ſo go home and dine with me."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This nobleman, I ſay, is a prodigy! for at eighty five he has all the wit and promptneſs of a man of thirty—a diſpoſition to be pleaſed, and a power to pleaſe others, beyond what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I knew; added to which, a man of learning, courteſy and feeling.—</p>

He heard me talk of thee, Eliza, with uncommon ſatisfaction, for there was only a third perſon, and of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, with us—and a moſt ſentimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal afternoon, till nine o'clock, have we paſs'd! But thou, Eliza, was the ſtar that conducted and enlighten'd the diſcourſe! and when I talk'd not of thee, ſtill didſt thou fill my mind, and warm ev'ry thought I utter'd! for I am not aſham'd to acknowledge, I greatly miſs thee—beſt of all good girls! the ſufferings I have ſuſtain'd all night on account of thine, Eliza, are beyond my power of words—aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly does heaven give ſtrength pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to the weight he lays upon us—Thou haſt been bow'd down, my
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0851700400:31"/>
child, with every burthen that ſorrow of heart and pain of body cou'd inflict on a poor being—and ſtill thou tell'ſt me that thou art beginning to get eaſe, thy fever gone—thy ſickneſs, the pain in thy ſide vaniſhing alſo—</p>
            <p>May every evil ſo vaniſh, that thwarts Eliza's happineſs, or but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakens her fears for a moment—Fear nothing, my dear, hope every thing; and the balm of this paſſion will ſhed it's influence on thy health, and make thee enjoy a ſpring of youth and chearfulneſs, more than thou haſt hardly yet taſted—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0851700400:32"/>
And ſo thou haſt fix'd thy Bramin's portrait over thy writing deſk, and will conſult it in all doubts and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; grateful good girl! Yorick ſmiles contentedly over all thou doſt, his picture does not do juſtice to his own complacency—</p>
            <p>Thy ſweet little plan and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy time, how worthy of thee!</p>
            <p>Indeed, Eliza, thou leaveſt one no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to direct thee in, thou leaveſt me nothing to require, nothing to aſk, but a continuance of that conduct which won my eſteem, and has made me thy friend for ever.</p>

May the roſes come quick back to thy check, and the rubies to thy lips! but truſt my declaration, Eliza, that thy huſband (if he is the good feeling man I wiſh him) will preſs thee to him with more honeſt warmth and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and kiſs thy pale poor dejected face with more tranſport, than he wou'd be able to do in the beſt bloom of all thy beauty—and ſo he ought.—I pity him.—He muſt have ſtrange feelings, if he knows not the value of ſuch a creature as thou art—</p>

            <p>How canſt thou make apologies for thy laſt letter! 'tis moſt delicious to me, for the very reaſons you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it—</p>

            <p>I Think you could act no otherwiſe than you did with your young ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, there was no ſhutting the door againſt him, either in politeneſs or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity—</p>

            <p>Now, I think it a thouſand times more likely, that he attaches himſelf to thee, Eliza, becauſe thou art a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more amiable—</p>

Five months with Eliza, and in the ſame room, and an amorous ſon of Mars beſides, <q rend="inline">"It no can be Maſſer."</q>—The ſun, if he could avoid it, wou'd not ſhine upon a dunghill; but his rays are ſo pure, Eliza, and celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, I never heard they were polluted by it—Juſt ſuch will thine be, my deareſt child, in this and every ſuch ſituation as you will be expos'd to, till thou art fix'd for life.—</p>
            <p>But, thy diſcretion, thy wiſdom, thy honour, the ſpirit of thy Yorick, and thy own ſpirit, which is equal to it, will be thy ableſt counſellors—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0851700400:67"/>
Surely, by this time, ſomething is doing towards thy accomodation—but why may not clean waſhing and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do, inſtead of painting your cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, as it is to be hung—paint is ſo pernicious both to your nerves and lungs, and will keep you, ſo much longer too, out of poſſeſſion of your apartment, where I hope you will paſs ſome of your happieſt hours—</p>
            <p>I fear the beſt of your ſhipmates, are only genteel by compariſon with the contraſted crew, with which thou muſt behold them.</p>

            <p>I Wiſh to God, Eliza, it was poſſible to poſtpone the voyage to India for another year, for I am firmly perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within my own breaſt, that thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band could never limit thee with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to time—</p>
            <p>I fear that Mr. B. has exaggerated matters,—I like not his countenance, it is abſolutely killing thee—ſhould evil befall thee, what will he not have to anſwer for—I know not the being that will be deſerving of ſo much pity, or that I ſhall hate more; he will be an outcaſt alien; in which caſe I will be a father to thy children my good

girl, therefore take no thought about them—But, Eliza, if thou art ſo very ill, ſtill put off all thoughts of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to India this year—write to your huſband—tell him the truth of your caſe—if he is the generous humane man you deſcribe him to be, he cannot but applaud your conduct—I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed, that his repugnance to your living in England ariſes only from the dread which has enter'd his brain, that thou mayeſt run him in debt, beyond thy appointments, and that he muſt diſcharge them—</p>
            <p>That ſuch a creature ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, for the paultry conſideration a few hundreds, is too, too hard!
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0851700400:72"/>
Oh! my child, that I could with propriety indemnify him for every charge, even to the laſt mite, that thou haſt been of to him! with joy would I give him my whole ſubſiſtence, nay, ſequeſter my livings, and truſt to the treaſures heaven has furniſh'd my head with for a future ſubſiſtence—</p>
            <p>You owe much, I allow, to your huſband; you owe ſomething to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances and the opinions of the world; but, truſt me, my dear, you owe much likewiſe to yourſelf—Return therefore from Deal if you continue ill: I will preſcribe for you gratis. You are not the firſt woman by many, I have done ſo for with ſucceſs—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0851700400:73"/>
I will ſend for my wife and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and they ſhall carry you in purſuit of health to Montpelier, the wells of Bancer's, the Spaw, or whither thou wilt; thou ſhalt direct them, and make parties of pleaſure in what corner of the world fancy points out to you—</p>
            <p>We ſhall fiſh upon the banks of Arno, and loſe ourſelves in the ſweet labyrinths of it's vallies, and then thou ſhould'ſt warble to us, as I have once or twice heard thee <q rend="inline">"I'm loſt, I'm loſt,"</q> but we would find thee again, my Eliza—</p>

Of a ſimilar nature to this, was your phyſician's preſcription <q rend="inline">"eaſe, gentle exerciſe, the pure ſouthern air of France, or milder Naples, with the ſociety of friendly gentle beings"</q>—</p>
            <p>Senſible man, he certainly enter'd into your feelings, he knew the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of medicine to a creature, whoſe illneſs has ariſen from the affliction of her mind—Time only, my dear, I fear you muſt truſt to, and have your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on: may it give you the health ſo enthuaſtic a votary to the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goddeſs deſerves—</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0851700400:75"/>
had been a panegyric on yourſelf—There is a dignity in venerable affliction which will not allow it to appeal to the world for pity or redreſs—Well have you ſupported that character, my ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able philoſophic friend! And, indeed, I begin to think you have as many virtues, as my uncle Toby's widow—</p>
            <p>I don't mean to inſinuate, huſſey, that my opinion is no better founded than his was of Mrs. Wadman; nor do I believe it poſſible for any Trim to convince me it is equally fallacious; I am ſure while I have my reaſon it is not—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0851700400:76"/>
Talking of widows—pray, Eliza, if ever you are ſuch, do not think of giving yourſelf to ſome wealthy nabob, becauſe I deſign to marry you my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—My wife cannot live long—ſhe has ſold all the provinces in France al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and I know not the woman I ſhould like ſo well for her ſubſtitute, as yourſelf—'Tis true, I am ninety five in conſtitution, and you but twenty-five; rather too great a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity this! but what I want in youth, I will make up in wit and good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour—Not Swift ſo lov'd his Stella, Scarron his Maintenon, or Waller his Sachariſſa, as I will love and ſing thee, my wife elect—all thoſe names, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

            <p>I Have been within the verge of the gates of death: I was ill the laſt time I wrote to you, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of what would be the conſequence.—My fears were but too well founded, for in ten minutes after I diſpatch'd my letter, this poor fine-ſpun frame of Yorick's gave way, and I broke a veſſel in my breaſt, and could not ſtop the loſs of blood till four this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—I have fill'd all thy India hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs with it, it came I think, from the heart—I fell a ſleep thro'
