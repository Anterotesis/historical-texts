            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS ſhort Account of Inoculating the Small-Pox,
bating the later Caſes annexed, was ready for the

Publiſhed, had not their <hi>Royal Highneſſes</hi> (at whoſe

Publick, by encouraging and promoting other Trials of that
kind, both upon Pariſh Children and grown Perſons. But
<hi>theſe,</hi> for certain Reaſons having hitherto been obſtructed, if
yet they ſhall be brought to bear, Care will be taken in

            <head>Mr. Maitland's
ACCOUNT
Of INOCULATING the
SMALL POX.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING underſtood, ſince my
Retirement into the Country,
that the late Experiment of
Inoculating the Small-Pox at
<hi>Newgate,</hi> has been pretty much
talk'd of; and finding withal, that the
Reports of that Matter are various, and
oftentimes contradictory: I thought it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
me, to give the Publick a plain and
honeſt Account of the Truth of Facts;
both to prevent, if poſſible, any one's being
impos'd upon, as to the Trials already
made; or ſear'd from the Practice of <hi>it</hi> for
the future.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0205300500:5"/>
'Tis not here my Deſign to offer an
Eſſay on the Theory of the Small-Pox; or
to attempt the beſt Methods of Cure: I
leave that to the learned Gentlemen of the
Profeſſion; who, I do not queſtion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all their beſt Diſcoveries and
Obſervations hitherto made, will certainly
agree with me, That <hi>it</hi> is a Diſtemper of
the moſt fatal and deſtructive kind; and
that, far from being poſſeſs'd of any infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Method or Remedy, they will own,
'tis many Times too too hard for them, and
very often baffles the moſt celebrated Skill.</p>
            <p>They cannot then be offended, (I am
ſure the better and more candid Part of
the Faculty will not) if, out of a ſingle
View of doing good, I here publiſh to the
World a certain Method of Relieving Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and reſcuing them from the Fears
and fatal Effects of that very loathſome
and malignant Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The Method I here propoſe, is no other
than that very plain one of raiſing the
<hi>Small Pox</hi> by <hi>Inoculation.</hi> A Method,
new indeed, and utterly unknown here,
till of late, tho' univerſally practis'd with
Succeſs all over <hi>Turky</hi> theſe threeſcore
Years paſt; and in other Parts of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi>
an hundred, or, for ought we know, ſome
hundreds of Years before. The Practice
having thus obtain'd amongſt an illiterate
Sort of People, what I here offer to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<hi>it,</hi> ſhall be delivered in the plaineſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0205300500:6"/>
Manner, and ſuited to the meaneſt Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
without the labour'd Embelliſhments
of Learning or Eloquence: And indeed,
one would think, theſe ſhould not be here
wanted, to reconcile to this very ſafe and
uſeful Method, even Perſons or a higher
Rank, and more delicate Taſte; eſpecially
ſince they, of all Sorts of People, generally
ſpeaking, ſuffer the moſt; witneſs the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
made in great Families, not many
Months ſince, by that Mighty Diſeaſe,
which ſeem'd then to go forth like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
Angel, ſubduing all before it, and
contemning all human Means us'd to ſtop
<hi>its</hi> Career.</p>
            <p>It may therefore be hoped, that This
Practice ſhould meet with a kind Reception
even by them, who, of all others, are moſt
terribly fearful of the prodigious Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs
of the Diſtemper, and of the ugly
and monſtrous Effects <hi>it</hi> leaves, both on
them, and their Children: Yet being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive,
that Sloth and Lazineſs, ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
Affection and Tenderneſs, and it
may be, ſome worſe Diſpoſitions too, which
I am not willing to ſuggeſt, may poſſibly
ſtifle this ſafe and uſeful Method in its
Birth; I ſhall here take a little Pains to
obviate the Scruples and Objections, which
are commonly rais'd againſt <hi>it.</hi> And in
Order to this, ſhall, firſt of all, give a
Short and Hiſtorical Account of what I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0205300500:7"/>
have ſeen and practis'd, both in <hi>Turky</hi> and
at <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1717, when I had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to attend the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador and
his Family at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I had a fair
Opportunity fully to inform my ſelf of
what I had long before heard, namely, the
famous Practice of <hi>Tranſplanting,</hi> or raiſing
the <hi>Small Pox</hi> by <hi>Inoculation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Enquiry chiefly turn'd upon two or
three Particulars, which, I thought, could
I be well ſatisfied in, would go a great way
towards convincing me of the mighty Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
and Safety of the Method, and
reſolving my greateſt Scruples and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
againſt <hi>it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having heard that this contagious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
which for many Centuries of Years
has prov'd ſuch a terrible Scourge to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
had its firſt Riſe in <hi>Egypt, Arabia,</hi>
and other Parts of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> I thought it
proper to enquire, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
ſtill to rage in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions
in that violent Manner it was anciently
obſerv'd to do; and as at times, <hi>it</hi> is known
to attack us here, and moſt other Parts
of <hi>Europe:</hi> For ſhould <hi>it</hi> be found to be
always of a milder and more temperate
Sort than ours, why ſhould that People
take ſo very ſtrange and uncommon a Way
to avoid <hi>it?</hi> I quickly found the Caſe to
be quite otherwiſe, being aſſur'd, beſides
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0205300500:8"/>
what I ſaw with my Eyes; that the <hi>Small
Pox</hi> is rather more Malignant and Epidemic
there, than with us; inſomuch that, as
ſome have affirmed, one half, or at leaſt
one third Part of the Diſeaſed, at certain
Times, do die of <hi>it</hi>; and they that eſcape,
are terribly disfigur'd by it<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid., D. Timoni &amp; Pylarini Epiſt.</note>.</p>
            <p>Again, I enquired what were the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
which attend, this new and ſtrange
Operation? And whether the Iſſue is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
known to be ſalutary? The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
both before and after the Eruption
was ſo very ſlight and gentle, that, in
Strictneſs of Speech, it could not be called
a Diſeaſe, having none of the uſual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of Pain in the Back, Vomitings,
Head-achs, Thirſt, Inquietude, and the
like, the Pulſe being only ſomewhat fuller
and higher than before; yet ſo far from a
Fever, that it ſcarce deſerves the Name of
a <hi>Febricula,</hi> bating ſome ſingular Inſtances,
which are ſo rare, that they are not One
to a Thouſand. And laſt of all, which I
thought not a little material, The Puſtules,
whether many or few, (and they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were from 10 to an 100, ſometimes more)
never left any Marks or Pits behind them,
except only in the Inciſions, or Parts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0205300500:9"/>
But ſtill I had one Difficulty left, which
I took to be the moſt conſiderable; and
which, if not fully clear'd, would render,
in my Opinion, the whole of the Proceſs
but trifling and precarious: And that is,
whether every one who has undergone this
Operation, is really ſecured againſt all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Danger of catching the <hi>Small Pox</hi> by
Infection? Were I but well aſſur'd of this,
I ſhould then, I thought, be at Liberty to
practiſe <hi>it</hi> my ſelf, and likewiſe with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
recommend <hi>it</hi> to others. All my
Enquiries here were fully anſwered beyond
Expreſſion: For I was aſſured by all, and
they could have no Deſign to impoſe upon
me, that there was not an Inſtance known
of any one's being ever infected, who had
had any Puſtules at all, how few ſo ever
rais'd by <hi>Inoculation</hi>; tho' for a further
Trial, ſeveral had been once and again
Ingrafted; and others alſo had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the Room, and in the ſame Bed
too with the Infected. This I rejoiced to
hear, and from thence concluded the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
to be univerſally ſafe and uſeful. And
indeed wonder'd not a little, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Authentic Accounts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
more than once tranſmitted into <hi>England,</hi>
there had never been hitherto any fair
and full Trial made of it.</p>
            <p>Hence alſo I could not forbear admiring
the very great Sagacity of the Men who
firſt invented this Method; and the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0205300500:10"/>
and diligent Obſervation of them
too, who ſo carefully practis'd it themſelves,
and ſo faithfully convey'd it to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
They all indeed were ſenſible of
the Benefit, and found their Account in it.</p>
            <p>About this Time, the Ambaſſador's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Lady, who had been at ſome Pains
to ſatisfie her Curioſity in this Matter, and
had made ſome uſeful Obſervations on the
Practice, was ſo thoroughly convinced of
the Safety of it, that <hi>She</hi> reſolv'd to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<hi>her</hi> only Son to it, a very hopeful Boy
of about Six Years of Age: She firſt of all
order'd me to find out a fit Subject to take
the Matter from; and then ſent for an old
<hi>Greek</hi> Woman, who had practis'd this Way
a great many Years: After a good deal
of Trouble and Pains, I found a proper
Subject, and then the good Woman went
to work; but ſo awkwardly by the ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her Hand, and put the Child to ſo
much Torture with her blunt and ruſty
Needle, that I pitied his Cries, who had
ever been of ſuch Spirit and Courage, that
hardly any Thing of Pain could make him
cry before; and therefore Inoculated the
other Arm with my own Inſtrument, and
with ſo little Pain to him, that he did not
in the leaſt complain of it. The Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
took in both Arms, and ſucceeded
perfectly well. After the third Day, bright
red Spots appear'd in his Face, then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear'd;
and thus interchangeably (as it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0205300500:11"/>
commonly happens) till in the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Seventh and Eighth Day, he
was obſerved to be a little hot and thirſty,
yet remain'd ſo but a few Hours; and then
the <hi>Small Pox</hi> came out fair: They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
round and yellow, like thoſe of the
more gentle diſtinct kind; and the Red
Spots which appeared firſt, were the fulleſt
and largeſt of all: They began to cruſt
a few Days after, and then gently died
away; ſo that the young Gentleman was
quickly in a Condition to go Abroad with
Safety. He had above an hundred in all
upon his Body; but without any the leaſt
Diſorder but what I have mentioned:
And they all fell off, without leaving any
one Mark or Impreſſion behind them. This
Operation was performed at <hi>Pera</hi> near <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
in the Month of <hi>March</hi> 1717.</p>
            <p>The Honourable Lady abovementioned,
who had been happily delivered of a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome three Months before, ſeeing the
great Succeſs of the Operation upon her
Son, had a Mind to have it tried alſo
upon the Infant: But this, for certain Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
was then laid aſide, and I hope very
luckily, being reſerv'd to ſet the Firſt and
Great Example to <hi>England,</hi> of the perfect
Safety of this Practice, and eſpecially to
Perſons of the Firſt Rank and Quality,
who have ever ſuffer'd ſo much by that
fatal Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0205300500:12"/>
This Noble Lady ſent for me laſt <hi>April,</hi>
and when I came, ſhe told me, ſhe was
now reſolved to have her Daughter Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated,
and deſir'd me forthwith to find
out Matter for the Purpoſe. I pleaded
for a Delay of a Week or two, the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being then cold and wet; for indeed,
I was unwilling to venture on an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
altogether new and uncommon here,
in a cold Seaſon; tho' I am now convinc'd
it may, with due Care, be practis'd at all
Times and Seaſons, but ſtill with more
Safety in the temperate and favourable.
I alſo pray'd, that any two Phyſicians,
whom they thought fit, might be call'd,
not only to conſult the Health and Safety
of the Child, but likewiſe to be Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes
of the Practice, and contribute to
the Credit and Reputation of it. This
indeed was at firſt deny'd me, it may be,
out of a Deſign to keep it ſecret, or leaſt
it ſhould come to nothing.</p>
            <p>In the mean time having found proper
Matter, I ingrafted it in both Arms, after
the uſual Manner; the Child was neither
blooded nor purg'd before, nor indeed was
it neceſſary, conſidering the clean Habit
of Body, and the very cool, regular Diet
ſhe had ever been kept to from her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.
She continued eaſie and well,
without any ſenſible Alteration, bateing
the uſual little Spots and Fluſhings, till
the tenth Night, when ſhe was obſerv'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0205300500:13"/>
to be a little hot and Feveriſh. An an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Apothecary in the Neighbourhood
being then call'd, prudently advis'd not
to give the Child any Medicine, aſſuring
them there was no Danger, and that the
Heat would quickly abate, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
it did; and the Small Pox began
next Morning to appear, which was indeed
ſome two Days later than uſual, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the uncommon Diſcharge of Matter
at the Inciſions from the Beginning. Three
learned Phyſicians of the College were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
one after another, to viſit the
young Lady; they are all Gentlemen of
Honour, and will on all Occaſions declare,
as they have hitherto done, that they ſaw
<hi>Miſs Wortley</hi> playing about the Room,
chearful and well, with the Small Pox
rais'd upon her; and that in a few Days
after ſhe perfectly recover'd of them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Ladies, and other Perſons of Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
viſited alſo this young Patient, and
can atteſt the Truth of this Fact. I need
not here be more particular in determining
the ſeveral Periods of this Cafe, they being
the very ſame with that abovementioned;
except only that here the Puſtules were
not ſo many, nor did they ripen ſo ſoon;
which may be eaſily accounted for, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having Regard to the Difference of
Climates, for there is little or nothing in
that, ſeeing the <hi>Circaſſians,</hi> and others
inhabiting the Banks of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0205300500:14"/>
a Climate much colder and more difficult
than ours, practiſe <hi>it</hi> with Safety.</p>
            <p>Another Inſtance I ſhall give for the
further Confirmation of this Practice; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
one of the learned Phyſicians above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
who had viſited <hi>Miſs Wortley,</hi>
having ſome Years ſince fully inform'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of this Method of Practice, and being
thoroughly ſatisfied of the Safety and
Reaſonableneſs of it, at length reſolved
to try it in his own Family: He had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
loſt ſome Children in a very malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
kind of the Small Pox, and therefore
deſired me to loſe no Time to ingraft the
only Son he had left. The Boy (who was
not quite Six Years of Age) being of a
pretty warm and ſanguine Complexion, the
Doctor ordered about five Ounces of Blood
to be taken from him; and then, in ten
Days after, having found Matter which he
lik'd, I inoculated him in both Arms. This
was performed the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi>; next
Day having look'd at the Inciſions, I found
them both inflam'd, which convinced me
the Thing had taken. Some Red Spots
appeared about his Temples the third
Day; and ſome two or three Puſtules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſeventh and eighth; the Boy
being all the while without any Thing of
Thirſt, Head-ach, or any other Diſorder,
only his Pulſe was obſerv'd to be fuller
and quicker; and then about the 10<hi>th</hi> or
11<hi>th,</hi> ſome more Puſtules appear'd round
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0205300500:15"/>
and yellow; and in two or three Days
more dy'd away: The Inciſions continuing
all the while inflamed, and diſcharging a
thick well-digeſted Matter.</p>
            <p>Here I could bring a great many Caſes
of Perſons inoculated in <hi>Turky,</hi> to prove
the conſtant and certain Succeſs of this
Practice; in all which I have never ſeen
any Miſcarriage, except in One, which was
wholly owing to the Raſhneſs and Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a Surgeon at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> I
would not here be thought to pretend to
a Secret, or to make a Myſtery of this
Operation; no, my Deſign is, only to adviſe
every one that attempts it to be cautious:
For ill Conſequences may ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and never more than in Things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and eaſy, and adapted to vulgar Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities.
In it ſelf indeed it is ſimple and
obvious, and may, like other plain Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical
Operations, be in a manner Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically
learn'd and practis'd: For, not
to mention ſeveral Surgeons, whoſe Buſineſs
it is; I knew an old <hi>Greek</hi> Woman, who,
having been taught it from her Youth, had
practiſed it with Succeſs a great many Years.</p>
            <p>Hence, if any Regard be due to Facts,
and to the moſt certain Obſervation and
Experience of others; which, in Matters
of Practice, have ever been counted the
beſt and ſureſt Direction; I am perſwaded,
all impartial People will allow this Method
to be not only ſafe, but uſeful; and highly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0205300500:16"/>
worthy to be receiv'd with Eſteem and
Applauſe. Is it not a Matter of the greateſt
Importance to us, to know how to prevent
the mighty Contagion of the Small Pox;
and how to preſerve our Children and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
from the violent Attacks, and fatal
Effects of it? What would not tender
Parents give to ſecure to them the Lives
and Features of their beloved Offspring;
when they behold them disfigured by the
loathſome Diſeaſe, and ſtruggling with the
Pangs of Death? Do not we oftentimes
ſee great Families extinguiſh'd by it, as by
the Plague, and their Titles and Eſtates
thereby tranſmitted to Strangers? And if
they have the good Fortune to eſcape with
their Lives, what an ugly Change from
what they were before? What Pittings,
Seams, and Scars in their Faces? What
Films and Fiſtula's, and ſometimes Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in their Eyes? What Ulcers and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthumes
in their Bodies; Contractions of
the Nerves, and even Lameneſs for Life?
Again, to avoid the Infection, what Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs
and Diſquiet of Mind, what Fears
and Apprehenſions do not even grown Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
labour under, eſpecially the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
and tender? Don't they renounce
all Commerce with their beſt Friends and
deareſt Relations? And if by chance they
meet an Object that has but lately reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
how ſuſceptible then are they of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0205300500:17"/>
the Diſtemper? And how few thus ſeiz'd
do ever eſcape?</p>
            <p>In ſhort then, to prevent all theſe, and
many the like Calamities, the almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
and inevitable Conſequences of this
fatal Diſeaſe; I may truly venture to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that the Method here recommended
is, of all others hitherto known, the ſafeſt;
and I am ſure far more infallible, than
that of the moſt learned and moſt cautious
Practice.</p>
            <p>I have, however, in Converſation, met
with ſeveral Scruples and Objections againſt
this Method; ſome whereof relate to the
manner of the Operation; which, I hope,
by the Account already given, are in ſome
meaſure ſatisfy'd: Some again concern the
Lawfulneſs of it; and others would even
ſeem to queſtion the Fact, denying that
the Small Pox are hereby rais'd; or that
the Eruptions ought to be deem'd of that
kind; ſince they are not preceded by a
Fever, nor attended with the uſual Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
of the Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>They that ſcruple the Lawfulneſs of this
Practice, are apt to call it, a Preſumption,
a forcing of Nature, a tempting of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and the like. True indeed, were
the Operation in it ſelf dangerous; and
the Iſſue generally doubtful, as ſeveral,
both in Phyſick and Surgery ſometimes are,
yet neither preſumptuous nor unlawful for
all that; I ſhould be ready to own the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0205300500:18"/>
Charge, and yield it at once to the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
and the ſcrupulous: But pray,
what are they afraid of? Is there any
Thing here frightful, or ſhocking to the
niceſt and the moſt delicate? The Practice
is moſt plain, rational, and eaſie, intended
only to prevent the malignant Infection,
and to preſerve Life: not to give a Diſeaſe,
and in this Senſe, to force Nature before
its Time; but in effect, to cleanſe Nature
from the latent <hi>Fomes</hi> or <hi>Seminium</hi>; and
to ſecure againſt that popular Contagion.
We have heard, and indeed it were much
to be wiſh'd we had any that truly deſerve
the Name, of Preſervatives againſt the
Plague; And why may not <hi>This,</hi> which has
elſewhere been ſo univerſally tried and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
paſs for One againſt the Small Pox?</p>
            <p>But again, what do they mean by tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Providence? Can they imagine,
that uſing the fair and proper Means of
avoiding and preventing a Diſeaſe, is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
to Providence? Why then do they
Bleed, Vomit, or Purge, or uſe any other
Remedy, to prevent a Fever? And why
don't they truſt that Providence, rather than
dare to abandon their Families, and deſert
the Diſtreſſed, to flee from <hi>this</hi> or any
other Diſeaſe? Nay, ſo far am I from
counting this Method tempting to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that I rather eſteem it a Motive of
Thankfulneſs to the divine Providence, and
a great one too, for, the Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0205300500:19"/>
As to the Objection againſt the <hi>Fact,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the Small Pox to be hereby rais'd:
Did the Eruptions come the natural and
common way, I acknowledge it to be highly
reaſonable: For the only way we have to
diſtinguiſh between the genuine Small Pox
of the ſeveral kinds, and the ſpurious, or
what they call the <hi>Chicken Pox,</hi> is not only
by obſerving the Nature and Periods of the
Puſtules, but alſo by the firſt Invaſion, and
ſubſequent Progreſs of the Fever, and of
the uſual Symptoms attending it. The
known Periods of the Small Pox are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
according to their different kinds;
and this Difference ariſeth, not only from
the various Diſpoſitions of the Juices and
Habits of the Bodies affected; but likewiſe
from the different Degrees and Qualities
of the External Infection, howſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
as it is more or leſs ſubtil,
malignant and epidemic.</p>
            <p>Now in <hi>thoſe</hi> rais'd by Inoculation, the
Periods, tho' a little different from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and natural, are, in their kind, as
certain and regular as the other: A Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
indeed is obſerv'd of ſometimes two
or three Days, as to the Time of Eruption;
but that is no more than what is common
in the natural Sort. And thus too, it is
with Reſpect to the other Stages of the
Diſeaſe: I mean thoſe of the Invaſion,
Maturation, and Declination; they are
equal and regular, and what is more, the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0205300500:20"/>
Proceſs is certain, and the Prognoſtick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
            <p>But the principal and moſt material Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of all lies in the <hi>Fever,</hi> which here
is ſo gentle, that it hardly deſerves the
Name; but in the natural, and eſpecially
the confluent kind, 'tis always violent, and
often the immediate Cauſe of Death.</p>
            <p>Were it not altogether foreign to my
Deſign, and inconſiſtent with the Brevity
I here propoſe, I could eaſily demonſtrate
the Cauſe of this Difference; and make
it appear, that the ſmall Quantity of the
Matter inſerted into the Capillary Veſſels
of the Skin, is not capable of altering or
diſſolving the Maſs of Blood, as it happens
in the Caſe of Infection; nor of raiſing an
Ebullition ſufficient to produce a Fever, and
the dangerous Symptoms which always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon it: And yet it is certain, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all this, that the Matter thus
inſerted does produce Eruptions of the right
Small Pox kind, with good digeſted Matter,
as hereafter deſcrib'd; and without any
Thing of the Danger and Loathſomeneſs,
ever inſeparable from the other.</p>
            <p>That it is the right and genuine kind,
may be further prov'd beyond all Exception,
by a few plain Inſtances here ſubjoin'd;
by which it will appear, that the Small
Pox thus rais'd by Inoculation, is truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious
and catching; and that ſeveral
Adult Perſons, who never before had them,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0205300500:21"/>
have been actually ſeiz'd, by means of kiſſing
and careſſing a Child, not quite three Years
of Age, while the Eruptions thus rais'd
were upon it. What ſtronger Proof can
reaſonably be deſired of the genuine Small
Pox? And what need is there of more
Words or Arguments to convince any one,
that will not be perſwaded by Facts?</p>
            <p>I am haſtening to give you an Account
of thoſe Facts, and do aſſure you, it ſhall
be an honeſt and a true one. But before
I come to it, I wou'd briefly take notice
of a Queſtion or two, which a learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
one Day ask'd me, on the Subject.
As firſt, Whether I was always ſure, thus
to give the Small Pox? And then, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when given, I cou'd engage the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
ſhould never take them again by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</p>
            <p>To the firſt, I anſwer'd, the Operation had
never yet fail'd me, or any one elſe, that
I know of; nor do I believe, it ever can,
when duly perform'd, but upon Perſons who
have had them before: For I very much
queſtion, what ſome have affirm'd, namely,
That there are People in the World, who
are not ſuſceptible of the Diſeaſe. In the
mean time, I had a Mind, with great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
to have ask'd the Doctor a plain
Queſtion in Anſwer to his; and that is,
Whether, when he preſcribes a Purge or a
Vomit, he is always ſure, it will anſwer
his Intention? For I have often heard,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0205300500:22"/>
that Vomits have ſometimes prov'd Purges;
and Purges, Vomits too; and, which is
worſe, that People have had the Misfortune
to die under both Operations; which has
never yet happen'd, in the Caſe of Ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>As to the Doctor's ſecond Queſtion, I have
ſaid ſomewhat already; and now can add
further, that beſides the frequent Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which have been made in <hi>Turky</hi>; as,
of Inoculating the fame Perſon a ſecond
and a third Time, and the like; I my ſelf
have lately made open and repeated Tryals,
on one of the Six Inoculated Criminals of
<hi>Newgate,</hi> reſerved for that purpoſe, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to convince any one, that there's no
Danger of their Catching the Diſeaſe by any
future Infection. This is, One <note n="†" place="bottom">See the Journal annex'd.</note> 
               <hi>Elizabeth
Harriſon,</hi> of about nineteen Years of Age.
Here I muſt obſerve to you, that this Girl,
had the feweſt Eruptions upon her, of any
of the five, that were Inoculated at <hi>Newgate,</hi>
but had a more than Ordinary Diſcharge
at the Inciſions.</p>
            <p>I firſt employ'd her as Nurſe to a Servant
Maid, very ill and full of the continued-diſtinct
Kind of the Small Pox, in the Houſe
of Mrs. <hi>Moſs,</hi> in <hi>Chriſt's Hoſpital</hi> Buildings
at <hi>Hertford,</hi> whom ſhe attended during the
whole Courſe of the Diſeaſe. This Maid
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0205300500:23"/>
had hardly recover'd, when one of the Boys,
about ten Years Old, of the ſaid Hoſpital,
was alſo ſeiz'd with the very ſame Sort; I
oblig'd her to lie every Night in the ſame Bed
with this Boy, and to attend him conſtantly
from the firſt Beginning of the Diſtemper to
the very End: And thus ſhe continued for
Six Weeks together, without Intermiſſion, or
feeling any the leaſt Head-Ach or other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order;
tho', indeed, I once ſaw ſome Heats
and little Pimples upon her, as Nurſes
commonly have under ſuch Confinements.
There's no Ground to queſtion this Fact,
being atteſted by a Cloud of Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>For a further Confirmation of what I
have ſaid, I once intended to have here ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
D. <hi>Timoni</hi> and <hi>Pylarini's</hi> Letters,
publiſh'd in the Philoſophical Tranſactions,
No. 339 and 347. But being unwilling to
enlarge this Account beyond its juſt Bounds,
I muſt leave them to another Opportunity,
and withal take the Liberty to refer the
Reader to them.</p>

               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 9. 1721. Being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> betwixt
the Hours of 9 and 10 in the Morning, I
made Inciſions in both Arms and the right
Leg of all the Six.</p>
            <p>10 <hi>and</hi> 11. <hi>Thurſday</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> I find
little or no Alteration in any of them,
except <hi>Mary North,</hi> who ſometimes was
troubled with Vapours, as uſual to her:
They all ſleep well, dreſs, and walk about
all day, and are hungry for their Food:
Their Pulſe a little rais'd, but without any
ſenſible Diſorder.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>Saturday,</hi> In the Morning; obſerving
the Inciſions not ſo much inflamed, and
tending to Suppuration as uſual; and thence
ſuſpecting the Matter ingrafted to have
been defective and languid, having been
kept at leaſt 15 or 16 Hours, for a very
good, but unavoidable Reaſon; I ſearch'd
for freſh Matter, and having found it in.
<hi>Chriſts Hoſpital,</hi> about 6 a Clock at Night
I made new Inciſions in each Arm of five
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0205300500:25"/>
of them, and ingrafted it as before. I had
no Matter left for the ſixth, <hi>Evans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, theſe five complain
all of Pain in both Arms: Having taken
off the Dreſſings, I find all the firſt Inciſions
inflamed and feſter'd, but without any
Sickneſs in the Patients; their Pulſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
higher, and their Water turbid.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, red Spots and
Fluſhings appear on all the five; but moſt
of all on <hi>Mary North,</hi> eſpecially about her
Face, Neck, and Breaſt: And ſo likewiſe
on <hi>Ann Tompion:</hi> But without any Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Head-ach, or Thirſt; except a little
they complained of in the Night; and a
higher Pulſe.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>Tueſday,</hi> The ſame Spots and Fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
appear freſh in the Morning; but turn
paler and darker towards Night, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Diſorder.</p>
            <p>It is here to be obſerved, That the ſixth,
<hi>viz. Richard Evans,</hi> who had had the
Small Pox in Priſon laſt <hi>September,</hi> has had
no manner of Pain, Heat, or Inflammation
in any of his Inciſions, nor any manner of
Alteration otherwiſe: But all continuing
pale from the Beginning, yeſterday dry'd
up entirely.</p>
            <p>16. <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> They all continue much
as before, only their Inciſions begin to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
a thick, purulent Matter. <hi>Anne
Tompion</hi> has a large yellow Puſtule on the
bending of her Thigh, and another on the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0205300500:26"/>
outſide of her right, Arm, like Small Pox:
And <hi>John Alcock</hi> has more freſh Puſtules
appearing on his Face and Arms; having
had a ſlight <hi>Febricula</hi> in the Night, with
diſturb'd Water. And <hi>John Cawthery</hi> has
a large yellow Puſtule on his left Cheek,
and ſeveral ſmall ones on his Face.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>Thurſday,</hi> The ſaid <hi>Alcock</hi> has theſe
Puſtules appearing now fairly, with a yellow
digeſted Matter, and red Bottoms, and a
great many of them, but without Sickneſs.
<hi>Ann Tompion</hi> has the ſame yellow Puſtules
on her right Arm and Thigh, with other
freſh ones ſtruck out about her Chin and
Mouth.</p>
            <p>18. <hi>Friday, Alcock's</hi> Small Pox appear
ſtill fair and yellow, but fuller and larger,
with a bright red round them. All the
others much the ſame, with their Inciſions
running.</p>
            <p>19. <hi>Saturday,</hi> Laſt Night, this <hi>Alcock</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably
pricks and opens all the Puſtules
he could come at with a Pin; which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
them to fall and cruſt ſooner: But
they continue red at Bottom; and the Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in him abate of their Running.</p>
            <p>It is here to be noted, that tho' he has had
by much the greateſt Number of Puſtules
or Small Pox upon him, yet the ſecond
Time he was touch'd in one Arm only,
there not being Matter enough for the
other Arm; whereas the other four had
both Arms ingrafted, and Matter in Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0205300500:27"/>
20 <hi>and</hi> 21. <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Monday,</hi> All of
them continue as before: The Inciſions
on the other four, run ſtill a thick, digeſted,
yellow <hi>Pus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I muſt obſerve, that the ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions
in both Arms, by which a vaſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
has been made, ſeem to me, in the
Iſſue, to have been rather a Prejudice and
Impediment to the <hi>Eruption,</hi> than to have,
in any Sort, contributed towards it: But
however, I believe them to be, in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
as ſafe from any future Infection as
<hi>Alcock,</hi> who had 60 Small Pox, at leaſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him.</p>
            <p>22 <hi>and</hi> 23. <hi>Tueſday</hi> and <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> All
of them continue well; and their Inciſions
ceaſe running, and dry up apace.</p>
            <p>24. <hi>Thurſday,</hi> I purg'd <hi>Alcock</hi> and <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thery</hi>
for the firſt Time; and did deſign alſo
to purge the three Women; but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by their. <hi>Monthly Purgations,</hi> which,
I was not a little ſurpriz'd to hear, ſeiz'd
them all about the ſame Time; tho' ſome
of them had been obſtructed ſeveral Months
before.</p>
            <p>28. <hi>Monday, Mary North,</hi> before ſhe was
quite free, unaccountably waſh'd in cold
Water, and thence caught a violent Colic,
which laſted near two Days.</p>
            <p>30. <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> They all three take a
purging Potion, which anſwers the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and perfectly carries off <hi>Mary North's</hi>
Colic Pains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0205300500:28"/>
31. The two Men are again purg'd, in
Order to their being diſcharg'd: And ſo
likewiſe, next Day, are the Women.</p>
            <p>And on the Sixth of <hi>September,</hi> they were
all diſmiſs'd to their ſeveral Counties and
Habitations.</p>
            <p>To conclude, The Thing has been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
on all the Five, far beyond my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
conſidering their Age, Habit of
Body, and Circumſtances; and it has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
anſwer'd Doctor <hi>Timoni's</hi> Account of
this Practice, and alſo the Experience of all
who have ſeen it in <hi>Turky.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot here forbear mentioning the
very ample Teſtimony, which Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> an
eminent <hi>Turky</hi> Merchant, one Day gave to
this Experiment, in my Hearing at <hi>Newgate</hi>;
After having ſeen the Perſons ingrafted,
and fully conſider'd their Inciſions and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions;
He openly declared, they were
the very ſame with what he had ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in <hi>Turky,</hi> of which he had ſeen a
great many Inſtances: And that we might
be aſſur'd, none of theſe here would ever
be infected with the Small Pox again.</p>
            <p>And it is particularly remarkable in this
whole Affair, that tho' there was not the
leaſt encouraging or favourable Circumſtance
attending it before the Operation; yet
after it, nothing in any ſort dangerous or
unſucceſsful did happen: Although no Art,
nor ſtimulating Medicine, was made Uſe of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0205300500:29"/>
to promote the Eruptions; not ſo much as
to oblige the Patients to keep their Bed; the
whole having been left to Nature, aſſiſted
by a ſtrict and regular Diet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 2. 1721. After due Preparation
of the Body, I ingrafted <hi>Mary Batt,</hi> an
Infant of two Years and an half old;
Daughter of <hi>Thomas Batt,</hi> a Quaker, living
at <hi>Temple,</hi> within three Miles of <hi>Hertford:</hi>
The red Spots and Fluſhings appeared on
her Face and Neck the fourth Day; and
ſhe kept playing about well till the ſeventh
or eighth, when ſhe became a little heavy
and thirſty, with a fuller and quicker Pulſe;
then the Puſtules came out freſh and full,
and the Inciſions diſcharged a thick well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted
Matter. She had not above 20 in
all upon her; they continued about three
or four Days, then dry'd away and fell off,
and the Child recover'd perfectly.</p>
            <p>Thus far all was well; but what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
afterwards was, I muſt own, not a
little ſurprizing to me, not having ſeen or
obſerv'd any Thing like it before. The
Caſe was in ſhort this; Six of Mr. <hi>Batt's</hi>
Domeſtick Servants, <hi>viz.</hi> four Men and
two Maids, who all, in their Turns, were
wont to hug and careſs this Child whilſt
under the Operation, and the Puſtules were
out upon her, never ſuſpecting them to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0205300500:30"/>
catching, nor indeed did I, were all feiz'd
at once with the right natural Small Pox,
of ſeveral and very different kinds; for ſome
had the round diſtinct Sort, ſome the ſmall
continued, and others the confluent; all of
'em had a great many, but eſpecially the
laſt, with the uſual bad Symptoms, and very
narrowly eſcap'd: But they all (God be
thanked) did well, (except one Maid, that
would not be govern'd under the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
who dy'd of it) and now enjoy a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
State of Health<note n="†" place="bottom">See the Certificates annexed, <hi>pag.</hi> 34.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 12. 1721. I Inoculated <hi>Joſeph</hi> and
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> Sons of <hi>William Heath</hi> of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>;
the firſt of about ſeven, and the
ſecond of three Years of Age; both with
the ſame <hi>Matter,</hi> and at the ſame Time:
the laſt had a very gentle and favourable
kind, in all Reſpects like the abovenamed
<hi>Mary Batt</hi>; but the firſt, <hi>viz. Joſeph,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a fat, foul, gluttonous Boy, who would
not be confined to the Rules and Directions
I had ſtrictly charged his Mother withal,
as to Diet and keeping warm; was taken
very ill before the Eruption, and after it
had a great Load of the continued ſmall
kind, but at laſt recover'd and did well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0205300500:31"/>
What a mighty Difference is here to be
obſerved between thoſe two Boys! the
Reaſon of it ſeems to be plainly this; The
younger, who had the favourable kind,
was of a clean Habit, moderate Appetite,
and eaſily govern'd during the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
The elder was not only, as I have
ſaid, of a groſs, foul Conſtitution, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
had a voracious Appetite, always
eating and filling his Belly with the coarſeſt
Food; as Cheeſe, fat Country Pudding,
cold boil'd Beef, and the like; which I
ſaw my ſelf as I came in by chance, the
third Day after the Operation; nor was
there any Care taken to reſtrain or keep
him within in cold, windy, froſty Weather;
he once wet his Feet in the Water; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that had he taken the Small Pox
by Infection, the World could not have
ſav'd his Life. Hence it appears how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
it is to cleanſe thoroughly thoſe
foul Habits before the Operation; and
withal to keep them to a very ſtrict <hi>Regimen</hi>
under it.</p>
            <p>'Tis alſo here very remarkable, further
to evince the Power of Infection, and the
Genuineneſs of the Inoculated Small Pox;
that an Infant of about four Months old,
then on Mrs. <hi>Heath's</hi> Breaſt, while ſhe nurs'd
her two Sons, and lay in Bed with them,
was alſo ſeiz'd with the diſtinct natural
Kind; and in due Time perfectly recover'd.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0205300500:32"/>
Mrs. <hi>Heath</hi> alſo, by being Night and Day
conſtantly with her Children, and always
embracing and careſſing of 'em, tho' ſhe
had had the Small Pox many Years before,
ſtruck out in ſeveral Pimples or Puſtules on
her Face and Hands, but without any
Thing of Sickneſs or Diſorder: which, we
know, has often happen'd to Nurſes, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
People in this Diſtemper; and even
by waſhing their Linen.</p>
            <p>Not many Days after this, I met Mr.
<hi>Hughes,</hi> Judge Advocate General of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Forces, who requeſted me, upon my
Return to <hi>Hertford,</hi> to viſit his two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
at his Houſe in <hi>Herting for dbury,</hi> which
I promis'd to do; and found, when I came
there, his Son, a Child of about 18 Months
old, actually ill of the Small Pox; I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
acquainted Mr. <hi>Hughes,</hi> with this,
and withal remov'd the Daughter, who
was about three Years of Age, to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Gentleman's Houſe. Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi>
then recommended to me the particular
Care of his Son, and pray'd me, if the
Small Pox ſhou'd prove of the favourable
Kind, not to fail to inoculate his Daughter
from him. The Boy had indeed the fair
diſtinct Kind, and not a great many, and
recover'd perfectly of them; but afterwards
dy'd of a cancerous Tumour, which had
been breeding in his Cheek and upper Jaw,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0205300500:33"/>
long before his Seizure with the Small Pox.
But to return, I took Matter from him, at
the proper Time, and with it Inoculated his
Siſter, <hi>November 17th,</hi> having firſt gently
purg'd her. The Thing took; ſhe ſicken'd, the
24<hi>th,</hi> and two Days after the Small Pox ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
fair, and continu'd to fill and ripen
to <hi>December</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> then cruſted and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
fell off in the uſual Manner.</p>
            <p>This Young Patient had above two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Puſtules or Small Pox upon her, that
came out well, fill'd up, ripen'd and fell
off, obſerving the moſt regular Periods of
the natural Small Pox of the diſtinct Kind;
yet ſhe did not keep her Bed one Day, nor
wanted a Nurſe to watch with her one
Night during the whole Proceſs; never
having been affected with the uſual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
and Symptoms of the Natural Small
Pox; nor in the leaſt pitted or ſcar'd with
them.</p>
            <p>I thought it proper to be the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
in relating this Caſe, becauſe of the
very falſe Account which had been given
of it in the <hi>Poſt Man</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 2, which,
in my Abſence, the Gentleman himſelf was
pleas'd to contradict in the <hi>St. James's
Evening Poſt, December</hi> 7<hi>th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> 17. I Inoculated two of Mr.
<hi>John Colt's</hi> Children, at his Houſe in <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
Lane, Lombard Street:</hi> The one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0205300500:34"/>
a Boy of 7, the other a Girl of about 4 Years
of Age; their Bodies having firſt been duly
prepar'd by a Phyſician's Order. They both
ſicken'd the 24<hi>th,</hi> the Small Pox appear'd
on the Girl the 26<hi>th,</hi> and on the Boy the
27<hi>th</hi>; they came out gently, fill'd and ripen'd
to the 3<hi>d</hi> and 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi>; and then
died away as uſual. Thoſe Children had
at leaſt 300 Small Pox each, all fair and
round; but the Boy had rather more: His
came out later, and kept out longer too
than his Siſter's; which can only be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for (the Ingrafted Matter having
been the ſame, and in the ſame Quantity) by
the Difference of their Habits and Juices.
In the mean Time, neither of 'em from the
Beginning cou'd be ſaid to be downright ill;
nor was oblig'd to lie in Bed; nor, in a
Word, was affected with any of the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
or bad Symptoms ordinarily attending
that Diſeaſe, or conſequential to it.</p>
            <p>They being perfectly recover'd; <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
January</hi> 13<hi>th,</hi> I perform'd the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon a third Child of the ſaid Mr.
<hi>Colt</hi>; a Boy of about 6 Years of Age, who
was alſo deſign'd to have undergone it
with the other two the Month before, had
it not been that he was then out of Order;
he continu'd chearful and well till the 20<hi>th,</hi>
when he became ill and feveriſh; then the
Small Pox appear'd the 22<hi>d,</hi> and three
Days after, the Eruption being quite over,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0205300500:35"/>
they grew fair, round, full and yellow;
like the natural Small Pox of the diſtinct
Kind, and thus went on to the 29<hi>th</hi> or
30<hi>th,</hi> when they began to cruſt and fall off
after the uſual Manner. This Child had
a great many upon him, like the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Miſs <hi>Hughes</hi>; and is alſo perfectly
well recover'd of them: He was viſited,
while under them (as indeed were the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two) by ſeveral eminent Phyſicians,
and other Perſons of Diſtinction about the
Town, who all unamiouſly agreed that it
was the right Small Pox, and declar'd
themſelves fully ſatisfied with the Trial.</p>
            <p>I do not here take notice of the little
Heats and Fluſhings, which appear'd upon
them in the Beginning; nor of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more minute Circumſtances generally
common to all; nor of the proper Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
preſcrib'd before and after; that I may
avoid tedious Repetitions, as much as I
am able. But I wou'd beg leave to add one
Obſervation, the Reaſon of which is plain
and obvious, namely, that the greater the
Diſcharge of Matter at the Inciſions is, the
fewer commonly are the Eruptions; and
on the contrary. Hence alſo the great
Advantage of <hi>Iſſues</hi> in <hi>This,</hi> and other
cuticular Diſeaſes, may with great Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
be evinced and demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>But to conclude: From theſe few Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which I have here contracted into the
narroweſt Compaſs, ſeveral very obvious and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0205300500:36"/>
uſeful Obſervations might be made, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
Proofs brought, to ſhew, in
the moſt Satisfactory Manner, that the
Small Pox thus rais'd are of the true and
genuine Kind; that they may be always
given and communicated to proper Subjects,
young or old, without any Danger of a
Relapſe; and finally, that this whole Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
prudently manag'd, is always Safe and
Uſeful, and the Iſſue ever Certain and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary.</p>
