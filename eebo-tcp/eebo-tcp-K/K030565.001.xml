            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is preſumed that the following ſelection will be found extremely uſeful to Readers of almoſt every claſs:—To the youthful, as it contains the choiceſt flowers of fancy, which cannot fail to warm and refine the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:—To the Stateſman, Philoſopher, &amp;c. as abounding in excellent maxims and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, drawn from extenſive reading, tried and approved by experience and obſervation:—To all who aſpire to enlarge the ſphere of their underſtanding, but to Engliſhmen in particular, as every Britiſh ſubject is intereſted in ſome part of it.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary to premiſe, that the paſſages ſelected from Mr. Burke's Pamphlet, entitled,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0244800201:4"/>
"A Vindication of Natural Society," are not to be taken as conveying Mr. Burke's own opinions, but as an ingenious and artful attack on the principles of Lord Bolingbroke.</p>
            <p>A ſketch of Mr. Burke's Life, with ſome original anecdotes, is prefixed, for which the Author entreats the indulgence of the Public, as it is the firſt attempt of a trembling pen in the biographic line.</p>
            <p>A copious index is added, to ſupply any defects in the arrangement of the different articles, as it was very difficult, amidſt ſuch a variety, to place every one under its proper head.</p>
            <p>The letter to Mr. Smith was tranſmitted by an anonymous hand, of courſe we cannot vouch for its authenticity.</p>

               <head>A SKETCH of the LIFE, WITH SOME ORIGINAL ANECDOTES OF Mr. BURKE.</head>
               <p>THE gentleman, who ſuggeſted the idea of the following ſelection, conceived that it would be acceptable to prefix ſome anecdotes of the author. If time, talent, and the nature of the work admitted, it would, in many reſpects, be a pleaſing taſk to trace this extraordinary man through all the mazes of his politics, to attend him in ſtudious retirement, to mark the boldeſt flights of his imagination, to fathom a mind, rich and profound as the ocean, and as eaſily agitated by every guſt of paſſion, and tornado of reſentment.—Mr. Burke was called into action in the moſt eventful period that ever enriched the page of hiſtory. His voice was early raiſed in favour of liberty in America. The blazing ſuns of India have been often loſt in the ſplendour of his eloquence. The fable children of Africa have numbered him in the liſt of their advocates, and almoſt every ſtate in Europe has, at one time or other, been the ſubject of his tongue and his pen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke was firſt taught to read by his mother, a woman of excellent underſtanding, and a highly cultivated mind. He was inſtructed in writing and accounts by Mr. James Fitzgerald, who kept a day-ſchool
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0244800201:6"/>
near Smithfield, Dublin. At the age of twelve he was committed to the care of Mr. Abraham Shackelton, a Quaker, maſter of an eminent claſſical academy in Balitore, in the County of Kildare. That the reader may form ſome idea of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor, and the ſeminary, we tranſcribe the following advertiſement, which appeared in the public prints about that time:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText xml:lang="eng">

                           <p>Abraham Shackelton informs his friends and the public, that being placed guardian over the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of the youth under his care, he declines, from conſcientious motives, to teach that part of the aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic courſe, which he conceives injurious to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and ſubverſive of ſound principles, particularly thoſe authors, who recommend in ſeducing language, the illuſions of love, and the abominable trade of war. Thoſe who deſign their ſons for the college, will take their meaſures accordingly. He profeſſes to fit youth for buſineſs, and inſtruct them in polite literature. His terms are ſix pounds per quarter—no entrance money demanded.</p>
                        </div>

                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>Mr. Shackelton was a man of fine even temper, ſevere in his morals, but extremely indulgent to his pupils, with regard to the bent of their genius, which he was ſtudious to diſcover and cultivate—his maxim was <hi>Natura ſequitur melius quam ducitur.</hi> Young Burke was very attentive to his ſtudies—ſometimes at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his health. He did not confine himſelf to the Greek and Roman claſſics, he read at intervals ſome of the beſt Engliſh writers, and evinced much taſte in the ſelection of the fineſt paſſages—many of which he committed to memory. He was paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fond of reading Don Bellianis of Greece. This circumſtance he mentioned himſelf one night in the Houſe of Commons, in the debate on the Affairs of Holland in 1786. He alſo takes notice of this ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0244800201:7"/>
in his Eſſay on the Sublime and Beautiful. Notwithſtanding he appears to have read the poets with all the enthuſiaſm of a warm imagination, yet it does not appear that he ever invoked the Muſes. At one time, it is ſaid, he could repeat all Young's Night Thoughts by rote; in a copy of this work, which he uſed to carry in his pocket, the two following lines in his hand-writing were found ſome years ſince on a blank leaf.
<q>
                     <l>Jove claim'd the verſe old Homer ſung,</l>
                     <l>But God himſelf inſpired Young.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Several of his witticiſms have been repeated by his ſchoolfellows, but as they are all unworthy of ſo great a genius, even in bud, we ſhall paſs them over, with this ſingle obſervation, that the ſhafts of his wit were not always winged with the feather of a dove. His filial piety was truly exemplary, and his affection for Mr. Shackelton, his maſter, was evinced on many occaſions. When the good old man viſited him in London, he received him as a father, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to many of his friends, particularly to Mr. Benjamin Weſt, the painter of poſterity, and what is ſtill greater, one of the beſt of men. He alſo mentioned him with great reſpect and veneration in one of his ſpeeches on the Teſt Act. Having paſſed a proper time at Balitore Academy, he was tranſplanted to Trinity College, Dublin, as may appear from the following tranſcription from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion book of that univerſity:</p>

               <p>Elected a ſcholar of the Houſe 26th of May, 1746, commenced A. B. 23d February, 1747-8.

               <p>Mr. Burke's father was an attorney, of ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in his profeſſion, very highly reſpected for the integrity of his character. Having completed his academic ſtudies, it is ſaid that he offered himſelf as a candidate to fill the moral chair in the Univerſity of Glaſgow, vacant by the death of his countryman Mr. Hutcheſon. Mr. Reid, however, was raiſed to that ſituation, which induced Mr. Burke to turn his attention to the bar. For this purpoſe he came to London, and entered his name on the books of the Middle Temple.

Miſs Nugent, the Doctor's only daughter, evinced, by her attention, how deeply ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the recovery of his health, and what at firſt aſſumed the name of friendſhip, changed into that of love. In ſhort, Mr. Burke was made happy in the poſſeſſion of a hand that beſtowed at the ſame time one of the gentleſt of hearts.</p>
               <p>His ſtudies became more diverſified, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of ſome pens induced him to turn his attention to ſome work that might raiſe his fame as a writer. His ſucceſs in this line was equal, nay, ſuperior to his expectation, but he ſoon found that <q rend="inline">"fondneſs of fame was avarice of air,"</q> in conſequence of which he procured a letter of introduction to the late Earl of Bath, the Mecaenas of the day. His Lordſhip received him with the utmoſt politeneſs, lamented that it was not in his power to render him any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as he was no longer in power. The impreſſion which this unexpected intelligence made on Mr. Burke did not eſcape his Lordſhip's eye; he felt for the ſituation of the young man, and after a pauſe, <q rend="inline">"I will give you a letter, ſaid he, to the Earl of Bute, though I don't know that I am entitled to take that liberty."</q> The propoſition revived Mr. Burke's drooping ſpirits, and he waited, without loſs of time, on Lord Bute, who profeſſed his ſorrow that it was likewiſe out of his power to render him any ſervice, as he had reſigned all his employments that very morning, adding, that his influence with his Majeſty was greatly over-rated; anxious, however, that a man of genius and talent ſhould not pine in the ſhade, he would take one ſtep, he ſaid, which he did not know he ought to take, but he would venture, and if crowned with ſucceſs, it would yield him great pleaſure. As Lord Halifax had been appointed to aſſume the vice-regal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ireland, perhaps in that ſituation, he would be able to render Mr. Burke ſome ſervice in his native country. The Earl accordingly wrote to
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0244800201:10"/>
Lord Halifax, and recommended the bearer of it as a man of promiſing genius, who would reflect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on his patronage and protection. The new appointed Viceroy expreſſed the deepeſt regret that every department in his appointment, except that of private ſecretary to his own ſecretary was filled up. Mr. Burke was accordingly appointed private ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the Right Hon. Gerard Hamilton, commonly called <hi>Single Speech</hi> Hamilton, in conſequence of his having made only one ſpeech in the Houſe of Commons during all the time that he ſat in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but which has ever been conſidered as an effort of unprecedented talent, and is thought to have been compoſed by the ſubject of theſe memoirs.</p>
               <p>Having now curſorily traced Mr. Burke to his firſt <hi>debut</hi> on the great theatre of public life (in which it was allowed on all ſides that he played his part with great applauſe) we ſhall introduce him in another character, not ſo ſplendid, undoubtedly, but ſtill more amiable. Having contracted an early acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with a Mr. Michael Smith, a country ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, it ripened into mutual friendſhip. Several letters paſſed between them; the following is a copy of one which Mr. Burke addreſſed to him, ſoon after his arrival in London. Mr. Smith, it appears, taught the Greek and Roman claſſies at this time in the pariſh of Fenagh, in the county of Leitrim.—</p>

                     <p>Mr. Balf was ſo very kind as to deliver me your friendly epiſtle about half an hour ago. I read it over, bleſt the firſt inventor of letters, and as I have plenty of ink, pens, and paper, and as this is one of my holidays, I intend to dedicate it to friendſhip.—Balzac having once eſcaped from a company, where he found it neceſſary to weigh every word that he uttered, chanced to meet a friend, <q rend="inline">"Come,"</q> ſaid he to him, <q rend="inline">"let us retire to ſome place where we can converſe freely together, and commit as many ſoleciſms as we pleaſe."</q> I need not tell you the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0244800201:11"/>
You'll expect ſome ſhort account of my journey to this great city; to tell you the truth, I made very few remarks as I rolled along, for my mind was occupied with many thoughts, and my eyes often filled with tears when I reflected on all the dear friends I left behind; yet the proſpects could not fail to attract the attention of the moſt indifferent; country ſeats ſprinkled round on every ſide, ſome in the modern taſte, others in the ſtile of old de Coverley Hall, all ſmiling on the neat, but humble cottage. Every village as gay and compact as a bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hive, reſounding with the buſy hum of induſtry, and inns like palaces. What a contraſt between our poor country, where you'll ſcarce find a cottage orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a chimney. But what pleaſed me moſt of all was the progreſs of agriculture, my favourite ſtudy, and my favourite purſuit, if Providence had bleſſed me with a few paternal acres. A deſcription of London and its nations would fill a volume. The buildings are very fine, it may be called the ſink of vice, but her hoſpitals and charitable inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whoſe turrets pierce the ſkies, like ſo many electrical conductors, avert the very wrath of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The inhabitants may be divided into two claſſes, the <hi>undoers</hi> and the <hi>undone,</hi> generally ſo, I ſay, for I am perſuaded there are many men of honeſty and women of virtue in every ſtreet. An Engliſhman is cold and diſtant at firſt; he is very cautious even in forming an acquaintance, he muſt know you well before he enters into friendſhip with you, but if he does, he is not the firſt to diſſolve that ſacred band; in ſhort, a real Engliſhman is one that performs more than he promiſes; in company he is rather ſilent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely prudent in his expreſſions, even in politics, his favourite topic. The women are not quite ſo reſerved; they conſult their glaſſes to the greateſt advantage, and as nature is very liberal in her gifts to their perſons, and even mind, it is not eaſy for a young man to eſcape their glances, or to ſhut his
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0244800201:12"/>
ears to their ſoftly flowing accents. As to the ſtate of learning in this city, you know I have not been long enough in it to form a proper judgment of that ſubject. I don't think, however, there is as much reſpect paid to a man of letters on this ſide the water as you imagine. I don't find that genius, the <q rend="inline">"rath primroſe, which forſaken, dies,"</q> is patronized by any of the nobility, ſo that writers of the firſt talents are left to the capricious patronage of the public. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this diſcouragement, literature is culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated in a high degree. Poetry raiſes her enchanting voice to Heaven. Hiſtory arreſts the wings of time in his ſlight to the gulph of oblivion. Philoſophy, the queen of arts, and the daughter of heaven, is daily extending her intellectual empire. Fancy ſports on airy wing like a meteor on the boſom of a ſummer cloud, and even Metaphyſics ſpins her cobwebs and catches ſome flies. The Houſe of Commons not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exhibits exploſions of eloquence, that riſe ſuperior to thoſe of Greece and Rome, even in their proudeſt days. Yet after all a man will make more by the figures of arithmetic than by the figures of rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric, unleſs he can get into the trade wind, and then he may ſail ſecure over pactolean ſands. As to the ſtage, it is ſunk, in my opinion, into the loweſt degree; I mean with regard to the traſh that is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited on it, but I don't attribute this to the taſte of the audience, for when Shakeſpeare warbles his <q rend="inline">"native wood notes,"</q> the boxes, pit, and gallery, are crowded—and the Gods are true to every word, if properly winged to the heart.</p>
                     <p>Soon after my arrival in town, I viſited Weſtminſter Abbey; the moment I entered I felt a kind of awe pervade my mind, which I cannot deſcribe; the very ſilence ſeemed ſacred. Henry the Seventh's chapel is a very fine piece of Gothic architecture, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the roof, but I am told that it is exceeded by a chapel in the Univerſity of Cambridge. Mrs. Nightingale's monument has not been praiſed beyond
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0244800201:13"/>
its merit. The attitude and expreſſion of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, in endeavouring to ſhield his wife from the dart of death, is natural and affecting. But I always thought that the image of death would be much better repreſented with an extinguiſhed torch, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, than with a dart. Some would imagine that all theſe monuments were ſo many monuments of folly—I don't think ſo; what uſeful leſſons of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and ſound philoſophy do they not exhibit. When the high-born beauty ſurveys her face in the poliſhed parian, though dumb the marble, yet it tells her that it was placed to guard the remains of as fine form, and as fair a face as her own. They ſhew beſides how anxious we are to extend our loves and friendſhip beyond the grave, and to ſnatch as much as we can from oblivion—ſuch is our natural love of immortality; but it is here that letters obtain the nobleſt triumphs; it is here that the ſwarthy daughters of Cadmus may hang their trophies on high, for when all the pride of the chiſſel, and the pomp of heraldry yield to the ſilent touches of time, a ſingle line, a half worn-out inſcription, remain faithful to their truſt. Bleſt be the man, that firſt introduced theſe ſtrangers into our iſlands, and may they never want protection or merit. I have not the leaſt doubt, that the fineſt poem in the Engliſh language, I mean Milton's II Penſeroſo, was compoſed in the long reſounding iſle of a mouldering cloiſter or ivy'd abbey. Yet after all, do you know that I would rather ſleep in the ſouthern corner of a little country church yard, than in the tomb of the Capulets. I ſhould like, however, that my duſt ſhould mingle with kindred duſt. The good old expreſſion, <q rend="inline">"Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily burying-ground,"</q> has ſomething pleaſing in it, at leaſt to me. I am glad that Dr. Sheridan is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and determined to ſpend the reſt of his days in your quarter. I ſhould ſend him ſome Botanic writings, which I have in view, if I were not certain that the Iriſh Hippocrates would rather read nature in

her own works; with what pleaſure I have ſeen him trace the delicate texture of a lily, and exclaim with the God in humanity, that <q rend="inline">"Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of thoſe,"</q> and you know that our lilies are fairer than new fallen ſnow. I am extremely ſorry that any diſpute ſhould ariſe betwixt you and your brother-in-law; he is, I know, a little hot-headed, eſpecially when he takes a glaſs, and I am afraid he leans a little too much to the ſocial can. Mr. Peyton, however, is a peace maker, and I am ſure, if the whole was laid before him, that he would ſettle it to your ſatisfaction, and the ſooner the better. You are quite miſtaken when you think I don't ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire Plutarch, I prefer his writings to thoſe of any other.—<hi>Sacra ſemper excipio, quae in ſummâ arce locare fas eſt &amp; aequum nunquam non in manibus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benda.</hi>

                     <p>Mr. Balſe ſets out for Germany in the ſpring, on a viſit to his uncle, who is now in Vienna. The General is very rich, and advancing in years, ſo that it is probable when he is called to repoſe on his laurels, that his nephew will be his heir, and I need not tell you that he is worthy of it.

                     <p>I once read of a King of Spain, Alphonſus, I think, who was cured of a dangerous diſeaſe by reading a paſſage in Livy. Your kind letter had much the ſame effect on me, for my ſpirits were ſo low the moment I received it, that it is not in the power of words to deſcribe my ſituation; but ſcarce had I read ſix lines, when my heart began to emerge, and the ſun ſhone as bright as ever, and if you pity a poor dealer in Syntax, buried alive, I may ſay, write to me as often as you can. My ſchool is on the increaſe, it is true, but the people are ſo poor that they cannot pay. I have thirteen Latin ſcholars, at a crown a quarter, and ſix and twenty in writing and figures. I have taken a little farm, of about five acres, ſo that betwixt the cultivation of my fields, and that of the tender mind, I have very little time on my hands, or my feet, I may ſay, for ſometimes I mingle in the dance. As to Greek, there is no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention paid to it in this quarter. Laſt week I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prevail on Mr. Johnſon to permit me to give his nephew a few leſſons in the language of Heaven. He ſaid he had no objection, if I could aſſure him that it would enable Jack to buy a cow or a horſe to more advantage. Having caſt his eye on a Greek book, which I had in my hand, What, ſaid he, would you have my nephew ſpend his time in learning theſe pot-hooks and hangers? Thus you ſee how learning is prized in this part of the world; and from your own account, I don't find that the Muſes are held in ſuch high eſtimation in England, which I was early taught to conſider as the ſeat of

What, then, is to become of their votaries?—neglected, and I am afraid deſpiſed!—You'll forgive me, I feel myſelf ſo uneaſy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed as often as I think on this matter, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help dropping a tear on my books—the only ſource and companions of my ſolitary hours, ſo that you ſee we have little cauſe to boaſt of the triumph of letters over the breathing marble, or the proudeſt trophies of war. Yet I join with you in bleſſing the memory of the man that firſt introduced the ſwarthy daughter of Cadinus into theſe iſlands. I think I can recollect ſome lines on this ſubject in the form of an aenigma, which, perhaps, you have not ſeen.</p>

She was born in Dublin, read her recantation in the pariſh church of Lurgan, near Virginy, in the country of Cavan, before the Reverend Mr. Sterling, who was a great muſician. Mr. Fleming did write ſome verſes on that occaſion, but it is not eaſy to procure them, for you know he's a great man—a Juſtice of Peace, and one of the Grand Jury. They began thus, I think:—

                     <p>I can recollect no more, and I don't know that theſe are correct. There is an anecdote told of her, and I believe there is very little doubt of the truth of it.—</p>
                     <p>Mr. — having ſpent ſome time in Paris, ſoon after his return happened to dine at Mr. Gore's, where Miſs W. captivated the company with her ſprightly wit and eaſy manners; our Pariſian hero paid ſuch attention to the glaſs, that the cloth was ſcarce removed when the table and chairs exhibited the effects of it, as well as thoſe that were preſent, particularly Miſs W. who, as ſhe happened to be formed of the common mould, was reminded of it, to which ſhe only anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I expected all this, I obſerved for ſome time paſt the yellow clay break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the plaiſter of Paris."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to Mr. Brooke, I believe I can collect you many particulars relative to him.—His father was a clergyman of the Church of England. He is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a Miſs Mears, a relation of his own. He has lately built a houſe at Longfield, one of the moſt deſert ſpots in the county of Meath. He is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt in agriculture, and has ſpent his patrimony in draining lakes, to very little advantage. He has
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0244800201:19"/>
had many children, but Heaven was ſo indulgent as to call them out of this life juſt as they began to taſte the miſeries of it.</p>
                     <p>Doctor Sheridan is well, and deſires to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered to you. I hope that you will write as often as you can. You can't conceive what pleaſure it will afford me to correſpond with you.</p>

               <p>Notwithſtanding the multiplicity of buſineſs that naturally devolved on Mr. Burke, as private ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to Mr. Hamilton, he had the happy art of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranging his affairs in ſuch a manner as to devote ſome moments to the cultivation of literature. He uſed to paſs two evenings every week in converſation with Doctor Thomas Wilſon, ſenior Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and Doctor Blundell, the friends of humanity and letters. The former offered to join with Mr. Burke in a tranſlation of Livy, but the latter preferred reading the ſententious Tacitus to the prince of Roman hiſtorians, and it appears from many parts of his maxims, &amp;c. that he ſtudied this writer with unwearied attention. Doctor Wilſon was conſidered as a wit, but it ſeldom roſe above a pun. Mr. Burke happened to meet him one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſhort coat, the Doctor immediately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that his friend did not know him in that guiſe, exclaimed,

He correſponded with his friends in every line as uſual, and received ſuch as viſited him with great affection. His character, at this time, was drawn by a lady in the following lines:
<q>
                     <l>With judgment witty, eloquent with ſenſe,</l>
                     <l>Polite with eaſe, and free without offence.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This I had from a gentleman, who, to uſe his own expreſſion, was very well acquainted with <hi>Single Speech</hi> Hamilton, and <hi>Double Speech</hi> Burke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton entertained ſo high an opinion of the talents and integrity of Mr. Burke, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him a penſion of three hundred a year on the Iriſh eſtabliſhment. On their return to England, they lived on terms of the greateſt intimacy, till the <hi>Protegé,</hi> began to think that his patron did not exert all the influence he ſtill poſſeſſed to uſher him into life; ſeveral letters paſſed between them on this ſubject, which ended in the diſſolution of their political friendſhip, and in order to leſſen the debt of gratitude, Mr. Burke reſigned his penſion, which was transferred to Captain Jephſon, author of the tragedy of Braganza, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As Mr. Burke had now entered on the arduous ſtudy of politics, he was determined not to relinquiſh the purſuit, in hopes that ſome favourable opportunity would preſent itſelf, which, if taken at the tide, might
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0244800201:21"/>
lead on to fortune and preferment. The weakneſs and ill-timed meaſures of the cabinet, with reſpect to the American colonies, threatened the downfal of the adminiſtration; it laſted, however, much longer than was expected; at length it was obliged to give way. Accordingly, on the 13th of April, 1765, the Marquis of Rockingham, William Dowdeſwell, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Lord John Cavendiſh, Thomas Townſhend, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and George Onſlow, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> were appointed Lords of the Treaſury; Mr. Dowdeſwell Chancellor of the Exchequer; the Duke of Grafton and General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Secretaries of State. The Marquis felt himſelf in want of a private Secretary; Mr. Burke was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to fill that confidential ſituation by Mr. Fitzherbert, the father of the preſent Lord St. Helens. Mr. Burke, in a ſhort time, rendered himſelf ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that he was brought into parliament for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough of Wendover, through the intereſt of Lord Verney. As the Marquis knew that fortune had only hitherto ſmiled on Mr. Burke deceitfully, he lent him £20,000 on his bond, as the moſt delicate mode of conferring ſuch a ſavour. Mr. Burke immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately purchaſed his elegant ſeat near Beaconsfield with this ſum, as an occaſional retreat from the <q rend="inline">"uneaſy ſeat of high deſires,"</q> or the conflict of paſſions, and happy would it have been for the world, perhaps, if he had thrown himſelf into the arms of phyloſophy, and ſpent the reſt of his days in the cultivation of thoſe arts which elevate and embelliſh human nature. But our young ſtateſman had taſted of power, and preferred the noiſe and intrigue of party to lettered eaſe and retirement in his enchanting Tuſculum.</p>
               <p>Mr Burke may be now conſidered as a fair public character, and therefore when the <q rend="inline">"Hiſtory of the Man,"</q> to uſe Lord Bolingbroke's expreſſion, is alſo the <q rend="inline">"Hiſtory of the State,"</q> great judgment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in ſelecting, and ability in compoſing, to produce a full, uniform, and compacted piece. I do not aſpire to ſuch qualifications, nor does it fall

               <p>As the Duke of Cumberland had recommended the new miniſtry, he conſtantly aſſiſted them with his advice; an advantage, which, it is very probable, the nation could not have enjoyed under any other miniſtry, and which, alone, might compenſate all the defects, if real, which the friends of the old miniſtry were continually finding in them. This advantage, however, though of continuance enough to be felt by the nation, did not laſt as long as the nation could have wiſhed, even under men of equal integrity and capacity with the preſent, and greater experience. Whilſt his Royal Highneſs was preparing one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſiſt at one of thoſe councils, frequently held to put matters in a way of being more ſpeedily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched by the Privy Council, and without whoſe aſſiſtance the Privy Council buſineſs muſt go on ſlowly, as the parliam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is preſumed that it would be almoſt an apology of itſelf for the introduction of the following ſketch of parties, &amp;c. at this period, to ſay that it came from the pen of Mr. Burke. It will alſo ſerve as an early ſpecimen of his powers as an hiſtorian, and even of his moderation.—</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"At the concluſion of our laſt volume, we ſaw the nation involved in the moſt diſtreſsful circumſtances that could well be imagined; our manufacturers at a ſtand, commerce almoſt totally annihilated, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions extravagantly dear, and a numerous populace unemployed, without the means of procuring a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood.

Such, and ſo gloomy was the proſpect that opened at home upon us, along with the year; nor did the view become more pleaſing by extending it acroſs the Atlantic, where the colonies exhibited nothing but ſcenes of anarchy and confuſion, where licentiouſneſs was carried almoſt to the higheſt pitch that it could poſſibly admit, without aſſuming another name; whilſt the profligate and abandoned (as is uſually the caſe in civil commotions) under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretext and maſk of liberty and the common cauſe, gave a looſe to their own unruly paſſions, and committed all thoſe exorbitances which the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar are ſo prone to, when under any pretence they are allowed to aſſemble in bodies, and through any relaxation of the laws, they have not the fears of immediate puniſhment upon them. We have before obſerved, that thoſe of an higher rank amongſt them did not take any pains to allay the ferment; it is probable that many of the more ſerious of them condemned in their own minds ſeveral acts that were committed, but did not think proper to damp a ſpirit, which, however irregularly or improperly exerted, they, perhaps, at that time, thought it conducive to their deſigns to keep alive.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"But though a violent reſentment ſupported the ſpirit of the coloniſts, they could not but ſenſibly feel the inconveniencies which an intire ſtoppage of trade muſt occaſion among a people who had hitherto ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by commerce. However, their warehouſes were full of Britiſh goods, for which they had not paid; and the many reſources of ſo vaſt an extent of country, abounding in the moſt eſſential articles of life, prevented them from feeling ſo much immediate diſtreſs as our own manufacturers and labouring poor at home.</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"It muſt be obſerved, that the enormous ſums owing to our merchants, in the colonies, added greatly to the difficulties the public were under, and ſeverely afflicted the trading and manufacturing part

They were under an immediate neceſſity of enforcing the ſtamp-act by fire and ſword, or elſe of moving its immediate repeal in parliament. In the former caſe, though there was no doubt of the ability of Great Britain to cruſh, or even extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the colonies, yet ſuch a deciſion, if not looked upon as abſolute ſuicide, muſt, at leaſt, be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as making uſe of one arm to cut off the other.</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"On the other hand, if the act ſhould be repealed, a colourable appearance was not wanting to charge them with ſacrificing the dignity of the crown, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the honour and intereſt of the nation to their own irreſolution, or elſe to a cauſeleſs animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity which it would be ſaid they bore to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, and a blind oppoſition to all their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"The loſs of their illuſtrious friend and patron, the Duke of Cumberland, ſeemed, at this period, to be truly critical to the miniſtry; his influence, his authority, his good ſenſe, his patriotiſm, and the high regard the public held him in, would have added greatly to their ſtrength and ſecurity.</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"Thus ſituated, they had an oppoſition to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, conſiſting of gentlemen, ſeveral of whom had held the firſt employments in the kingdom, and who, for abilities, experience, knowledge of buſineſs, property, and connexions, were very reputable, and therefore truly formidable.</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Some of theſe gentlemen ſeemed obliged in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as well as through opinion, and a ſpirit of oppoſition, to embark warmly in vindication and ſupport of meaſures which had originally been their own, for which it may be ſuppoſed they had the natural partiality of a parent, and in defence of which they were determined to diſpute every inch of ground with the miniſtry. Some alſo joined them through principle.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"They thought that the inſolence of the Americans deſerved chaſtiſement, where, otherwiſe, the hardſhip of their circumſtances might merit relief. Others there were who gave themſelves no trouble as to the rectitude of the American taxation, but who would have been very glad that their own burthens at home could be at all lightened, by any ſums, that could be drawn in any manner, out of the pockets of the coloniſts; and, in general, it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the lovers and aſſertors of high prerogative naturally chimed in with the reſt, upon their own principles. There were not a few alſo who firſt kept aloof from, and in due time declared againſt the miniſtry, upon ſome ſymptoms which appeared early, of their wanting that countenance, which, as it hath been favourable or adverſe, has determined the good or ill fortune of the ſeveral ſucceſſive ſyſtems of adminiſtration for ſome years paſt. This part of the oppoſition was, for very obvious reaſons, by much the moſt dangerous.</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"To balance this powerful oppoſition, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration conſiſted of gentlemen, who, though many of them were young in office, were yet extremely high in eſtimation; whoſe characters were clear, whoſe integrity was far above ſuſpicion, and whoſe
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0244800201:26"/>
abilities ſeemed to grow with the difficulties of the buſineſs they were engaged in; their conſtant adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence alſo to the cauſe of liberty had procured them the confidence and good will of the public, both of which they enjoyed in a very eminent degree<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Burke is ſuppoſed to have included himſelf in this claſs.</note>. They had, beſides, ſome other advantages, as they were not bound to the ſupport of meaſures at all events, merely becauſe they had planned or adviſed them; ſo they could weigh matters with coolneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality, and judge without prejudice or paſſion; at leaſt they had the happineſs not to be obliged to act ſyſtematically wrong.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"They appear, accordingly, to have avoided, as well as in matters ſo critical, perhaps, they could be avoided, the two extremes; in one, which it was apprehended they muſt inevitably have ſtruck, they neither precipitated affairs in America by the raſhneſs of their councils, nor did they ſacrifice the dignity of the crown or nation by irreſolution or weakneſs; and the firmneſs, as well as temper, which appeared in their diſpatches to the different governors, when examined by the Houſe, did them the greateſt honour. By preſerving this medium, by ſuſpending their own judgment in a matter of ſo great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, till they had obtained that of the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the nation, they ſtill left it in the power of the ſupreme legiſlature to uſe healing meaſures, and did not urge their fellow ſubjects, through deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the committal of ſuch acts as could not be forgiven.</q>

ſo deeply engaged before the meeting of parliament that the legiſlative could not then in honour recede from the ſupport of it. Upon this principle, the plan of moderation that had been adopted, was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with the greateſt acrimony, and the ſevereſt invectives pointed at adminiſtration, for not having immediately employed troops and ſhips of war to enforce the laws in ſuch a manner, as the outrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the reſiſtance, and the importance of the authority which was reſiſted, did, as they aſſerted, indiſpenſably require.</q>

They both alſo proved a great deal too much, while the former ſeemed to conſider the colonies rather as independent ſtates, in a ſort of equal alliance with the mother country, than as deminions depending upon and belonging to her; they furniſhed the ſtrongeſt reaſons why that irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſpirit of enthuſiaſm ſhould be timely checked, by making them ſenſible of their dependence.</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"On the other hand, the enemies of the colonies, by exaggerating their power, opulence, and popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſufficiently proved the neceſſity of treating them with tenderneſs, as if their calculations were allowed to be half founded, it muſt be impoſſible to retain them long in ſubjection by any other means.</q>

An addreſs having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in anſwer to the king's ſpeech, a motion was made by the oppoſition, that his majeſty might be addreſſed to give orders, that copies of all lettters, papers, orders or inſtructions, ſent from the Secretary of State's office, or the other principal departments, to the governors and officers of the crown in North America, together with copies of all anſwers thereto, and of all other papers relative to the late diſturbance there, to the execution of the ſtamp duty, to the enforcing of the law, and to the quelling of riotous and tumultuous diſorders, ſhould be laid before the houſe.

But theſe appear to have been ſo many objects that tended rather to excite than to diſmay our young ſenator his mind was well ſtored with reading, his imagination glowing, his heart, no do doubt, filled with gratitude to thoſe that had raiſed him to that exalted ſituation, and every pulſe beating high with emulation to diſtinguiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his tongue, as he had already done ſo by his pen.

The next queſtion that involved the conſideration of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was a bill for the <q rend="inline">"total repeal of the ſtamp-act, brought on in the ſpring of 1766."</q> This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous queſtion furniſhed Mr. Burke with a full opportunity of bringing all his oratorial powers into the field; it muſt be confeſſed that he conducted them with all the energy of a youthful commander, and all the prudence of an experienced General, till victory, after a dubious conteſt, at length perched on the banners of adminiſtration. The univerſal joy which pervaded the nation on this occaſion, cannot
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:0244800201:30"/>
be better expreſſed than in his own words. <q rend="inline">"I remember, Sir, (addreſſing himſelf to the ſpeaker) with a melancholy pleaſure, the ſituation of the Honourable Gentleman (the late Field Marſhal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) who made the motion for the repeal of the ſtamp-act.

When at length you had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in their favour, and your doors thrown open, ſhowed them the figure of their deliverer in well earneſt triumph of his important victory, from the whole of that grave multitude there aroſe an involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary burſt of gratitude and tranſport. They jumped upon him like children on a long abſent father; they clung about him as captives about their redeemer; all England, all America, joined in his applauſe; nor did he ſeem inſenſible to the beſt of all earthly rewards, the love and admiration of his fellow-citizens; hope elevated, and joy brightened his creſt; I ſtood near him, and his face, to uſe the expreſſion of the ſcripture of the firſt Martyr, <q rend="inline">'his face was as if it had been the face of an angel.'</q> I do not know how others feel; but if I had ſtood in that ſituation, I never would have exchanged it for all that kings in their profuſion could beſtow."</q>—Vide Mr. Burke's ſpeech, 19th April, 1794, 4 to Ed. p. 36.</p>
               <p>Hitherto matters had gone on in the moſt ſucceſsful manner with the miniſtry; they had weathered a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, dangerous, and ſtormy winter; they had gained every point they attempted in parliament; and had ſecured the confidence and good will of the public in a very high degree. They had beſides acquired ſome credit in their foreign tranſactions; they had concluded an advantageous commercial treaty with the Empreſs of Ruſſia; they ſettled the long conteſted affair of the Canada bills, to the ſatisfaction of the owners of them; and made ſome progreſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving

               <p>It was then, to the great ſurpriſe of the nation, that, notwithſtanding theſe appearances, a ſudden and unexpected change took place in the miniſtry.

Many other changes took place both at home and ſubſequently in all the different depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſtate.</p>
               <p>The patriotic opinion which has been conceived of the late miniſtry, was much increaſed by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedneſs they had ſhewn upon quitting their places; as they retired without a place, penſions, or reverſion ſecured to themſelves or their friends. The ſenſe which the public held of their ſervices, was alſo teſtified by the numerous addreſſes which were preſented to the Marquis of Rockingham upon that occaſion. On the other hand, many of thoſe who
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:0244800201:32"/>
were moſt attached to the Earl of Chatham regretted, that inſtead of weakening and dividing an intereſt, which the public wiſhed to be ſupported, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to remove a miniſtry, in which they had placed a confidence; he had moſt rather, by coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding and acting along with them, contributed to give them that permanency, which was ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and wanted. There were other reaſons which contributed greatly to leſſen the popularity of which the noble Lord had before poſſeſſed ſo boundleſs a ſhare; among thoſe, his quitting the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and accepting peerage, was not the leaſt; and his acting alone with, and bringing into place and power, perſons who had the misfortune to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a party, which had been long held very obnoxious, contributed its full ſhare<note n="*" place="bottom">Annual Regiſter for 1766.</note>,</p>
               <p>The following is Mr. Burke's own account of his introduction into public life, as well as the ſhare which adminiſtration took in the repeal of the ſtamp-act.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">Sir, I will anſwer him (Mr. Cornwall) as clearly as I am able, and with great openneſs; I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to conceal. In the year ſixty-five, being in a very private ſtation, far enough from any line of buſineſs, and not having the honour of a ſeat in this houſe, it was my fortune, unknowing and unknown to the then miniſtry, by the intervention of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon friend, to become connected with a very noble perſon (Marquis of Rockingham) and at the head of the treaſury department. It was indeed in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of little rank and no conſequence, ſuitable to the mediocrity of my talents and pretenſions. But a ſituation near enough to enable me to ſee, as well as others, what was going on; and I did ſee in that noble perſon ſuch ſound principles, ſuch an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mind, ſuch clear and ſagacious ſenſe, and ſuch unſhaken fortitude, as have bound me, as well as others much better than me, by an inviolable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:0244800201:33"/>
to him from that time forward. Sir, Lord Rockingham very early in that ſummer received a ſtrong repreſentation from many weighty Engliſh merchants and manufacturers, from governors of provinces and commanders of men of war, againſt almoſt the whole of the American commercial regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and particularly with regard to the total ruin which was threatened to the Spaniſh trade. I believe, Sir, the noble Lord ſoon ſaw his way in this buſineſs. But he did not raſhly determine againſt acts which it migh be ſuppoſed were the reſult of much delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. However, Sir, he ſcarcely began to open the ground, when the whole veteran body of office took the alarm. A violent outcry of all (except thoſe who knew and felt the miſchief) was raiſed againſt any alteration. On one hand, his attempt was a direct violation of treaties and public law.—On the other, the act of navigation and all the corps of trade laws were drawn up in array againſt it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The firſt ſtep the noble Lord took, was to have the opinion of his excellent, learned, and ever lamented friend, the late Mr. Yorke, then Attorney General, on the point of law. When he knew that formally and officially, which in ſubſtance he had known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he immediately diſpatched orders to redreſs the grievance. But I will ſay it for the then miniſter, he is of that conſtitution of mind, that I know he would have iſſued, on the ſame critical occaſion, the very ſame orders, if the acts of trade had been, as they were not, directly againſt him; and would have chearfully ſubmitted to the equity of parliament for his indemnity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"On the concluſion of this buſineſs of the Spaniſh trade, the news of the troubles, on account of the ſtamp-act, arrived in England. It was not until the end of October that theſe accounts were received. No ſooner had the ſound of that mighty tempeſt reached us in England, than the whole of the then oppoſition, inſtead of feeling humbled by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:0244800201:34"/>
iſſue of their meaſures, ſeemed to be infinitely elated, and cried out, that the miniſtry, from envy to the glory of their predeceſſors, were prepared to repeal the ſtamp-act. Near nine years after, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable gentleman takes quite oppoſite ground, and now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> me to put my hand to my heart, and ſay, whether the miniſtry had reſolved on the repeal till a conſiderable time after the meeting of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Though I do not very well know what the honourable gentleman wiſhes to infer from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or from the denial of this fact, on which he ſo earneſtly adjures me; I do put my hand on my heart, and aſſure him, that they did <hi>not</hi> come to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution directly to repeal. They weighed this matter as its difficulty and importance required. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered maturely among themſelves. They conſulted with all who could give advice or information. It was not determined until a little before the meeting of parliament; but it was determined, and the main lines of their own plan marked out, before that meeting. Two queſtions aroſe (I hope I am not going into a narrative troubleſome to the Houſe)</q>
               </p>
               <p>[A cry of, go on, go on.]</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The firſt of the two conſiderations was, whether the repeal ſhould be total, or whether only partial; taking out every thing burthenſome and productive, and reſerving only an empty acknowledgment, ſuch as a ſtamp on cards or dice. The other queſtion was, on what principle the act ſhould be repealed? On this head alſo two principles were ſtarted. One, that the legiſlative rights of this country, with regard to America, were not entire, but had certain reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and limitations. The other principle was, that taxes of this kind were contrary to the fundamental principles of commerce on which the colonies were founded; and contrary to every idea of political equity, by which equity we are bound, as much as poſſible to extend the ſpirit and benefit of the Britiſh conſtitution to every part of the Britiſh dominions.
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:0244800201:35"/>
The option, both of the meaſure, and of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of repeal, was made before the ſeſſion; and I wonder how any one can read the king's ſpeech at the opening of that ſeſſion, without ſeeing in that ſpeech both the repeal and the declaratory act very ſufficiently crayoned out. Thoſe who cannot ſee this can ſee nothing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">Surely the honourable gentleman will not think that a great deal leſs time than was then employed, ought to have been ſpent in deliberation; when he conſiders that the news of the troubles did not arrive till towards the end of October. The parliament ſat to fill the vacancies on the 14th day of December, and on buſineſs the 14th of the following January."—<bibl>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Burke then proceeded to ſtate the principle on which adminiſtration acted in the repeal of this act.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"A partial repeal,"</q> ſays he, <q rend="inline">"or as the bon ton of the court then was, a modification, would have ſatisfied a timid, unſyſtematic, procraſtinating mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, as ſuch a meaſure has ſince done ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. A modification is the conſtant reſource of weak, undeciding minds. To repeal by a denial of our right to tax in the preamble (and this too did not want adviſers), would have cut, in the heroic ſtile, the Gordian knot with a ſword. Either meaſure would have coſt no more than a day's debate. But when the total repeal was adopted, and adopted on principles of policy, of equity, and of commerce, this plan made it neceſſary to enter into many and difficult meaſures. It becomes neceſſary to open a very large field of evidence commenſurate to theſe extenſive views. *** I think the enquiry laſted in the committee for ſix weeks; and at its concluſion this houſe, by an independent, noble, ſpirited, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected majority,—by a majority that will redeem all the acts ever done by majorities in parliament,—in the teeth of all the old mercenary Swiſs of ſtate,—in deſpite of all the ſpeculators and augurs of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:0244800201:36"/>
events,—in defiance of the whole embattled le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of veteran penſioners and practiſed inſtruments of a court, gave a total repeal to the ſtamp-act, and (if it had been ſo permitted) a laſting peace to this whole empire."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Burke then adds, <q rend="inline">"if the conduct of miniſtry in prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>g the repeal, had ariſen from timidity with regard to themſelves, it would have been greatly to be condemned. Intereſted timidity diſgraces as much in this cabinet, as perſonal timidity does in the field. But timidity, with regard to the well being of our country, is heroic virtue. The noble Lord (Marquis of Rockingham) who then conducted affairs, and his worthy colleagues, whilſt trembling at the proſpects of ſuch diſtreſſes as you have ſince brought upon yourſelves, were not afraid ſteadily to look in the face that glaring and dazzling influence, at which the eyes of eagles have blanched. He looked in the face one of the ableſt, and let me ſay, not the moſt ſcrupulous oppoſitions that perhaps ever was in this houſe, and withſtood it, unaided by even one of the uſual ſupports of adminiſtration."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Short a time as Mr. Burke was in office, he took care to render himſelf maſter of ſomething more than what Mr. Canning calls the <hi>mechanical</hi> part of it, and accordingly we find him in oppoſition unfold the intrigues of the new adminiſtration with uncommon art and dexterity—nor was he ſparing of ridicule, which he always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ot with unerring hand;—in ſhort it may be ſaid that he brightened from colliſion, and gathered ſtrength even from defeat. Thoſe that wreſtle with us, as he ſays himſelf, ſtrengthen us,—nor did he confine his attacks to the ſenate, for he and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Richard, aſſiſted by his relative William Burke, publiſhed ſeveral papers in defence of the Rocking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham party, in the Gazetteer, under various ſignatures, from the year 1766 to 1768. Some of thoſe papers were written in anſwer to Mr. Scott, of Cambridge, who appeared at the time under the ſignature of Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſejanus.
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:0244800201:37"/>
As Mr. Burke was naturally of an active diſpoſition of mind, his moments were conſtantly employed, either in conſulting the beſt writers, converſing with the moſt intelligent on the moſt uſeful ſubjects, occaſionally pruning his trees, or directing his rivulets. His own account of his ſtudies will be preferred to mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"When,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"I firſt devoted myſelf to the public ſervice, I conſidered how I ſhould render myſelf fit for it; and this I did by endeavouring to diſcover what it was, that gave this country the rank it holds in the world. I found that our proſperity and dignity aroſe principally, if not ſolely, from two ſources—our conſtitution and commerce. Both theſe I have ſpared no ſtudy to underſtand, and no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſupport."—<bibl>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In 1766, Mr. Burke paid a viſit to Ireland, where he found a number of perſons, who had diſcovered that they were related to him, ſince he became a Britiſh Senator. He did not, however, forget his <hi>old</hi> friends in the long liſt of his <hi>new</hi> relations—he viſited all, received all with affability and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, retraced with rapture the ſcenes of his boyiſh days—and returned to his duty in the latter end of March 1768; in the ſame year he was returned at the general election for the borough of Malton in Yorkſhire, through the intereſt of the Marquis, his patron.</p>
               <p>The ſeſſion of 1768 was opened with a clouded proſpect. The high price of proviſions was very ſeverely felt by thoſe who earned them with the ſweat of their brow; the reſtraining act relative to the Eaſt India company; the <hi>Nullum Tempus Bill,</hi> afforded ample room for diſcuſſion. Mr. Burke took a very active part in all thoſe queſtions, in which he was very ably ſupported by Mr. Dowdeſwell, Mr. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, (late Lord Aſhburton) and Colonel Barré. Such union of talents was equal to the diſcuſſion of any ſubject that could poſſibly be advanced. Mr.
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:0244800201:38"/>
Burke was always found on his poſt, the firſt on the breach, and the laſt on the mine. The brilliancy of his talents was ſo univerſally felt and acknowledged, that he was ranked as the leader of the Rockingham party.</p>
               <p>Sometimes his zeal, and the natural warmth of his temper, would urge him to preſs a point beyond its due bounds, which afforded his opponents a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary triumph;—temporary indeed! for the eaſe and ingenuity with which he uſed to recover his previous poſition, evinced the reſources of his mind, and the ſubtilty of his imagination, which induced the great Lord Chatham to ſay on one of theſe occaſions, that Burke could only be wounded by Burke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke, it is true, enliſted under the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of party, but as that party may be called the guardian of the conſtitution, he was left at full liberty to ſuggeſt ſuch meaſures as would forward or ſecure the moſt patriotic objects; in ſhort he was left to the full diſplay of his own powers and opinions, and rather led than followed in almoſt every debate.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Grafton was daily loſing ground; an adminiſtration, <q rend="inline">"ſo chequered and ſpeckled, a piece of joinery ſo croſsly indented, and ſo whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally dovetailed,"</q> could not ſupport itſelf againſt the eloquence of Mr. Burke, and the pen of Junius. Accordingly, on the 28th of January, 1770, his Grace reſigned his ſituation, as firſt Lord of the Treaſury, and was ſucceeded by the Right Hon. Frederick Lord North. Mr. Burke deſcribes the ſituation of public affairs at this period in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words:—</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Nobody, I believe, will conſider it merely as the language of ſpleen or diſappointment, if I ſay, that there is ſomething particularly alarming in the preſent conjuncture. There is hardly a man in or out of power who holds any other language. That government is at once dreaded and contemned; that the laws are deſpoiled of all their reſpect and
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:0244800201:39"/>
ſalutary terrors; that their inaction is a ſubject of ridicule, and their exertion of abhorrence; that rank, and office, and title, and all the ſolemn plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities of the world, have loſt their reverence and effect; that our foreign politics are as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged as our domeſtic oeconomy; that our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies are ſlackened in their affection, and looſened from their obedience; that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforce; that hardly any thing above or below, abroad or at home, is ſound and entire; but that diſconnexion and confuſion, in office, in parties, in families, in parliament, in the nation, prevail beyond the diſorders of any former time:—theſe are facts univerſally admitted and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl of Chatham ſaw things in the ſame alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing point of view. <q rend="inline">"At my time of life,"</q> ſays that venerable ſtateſman<note n="*" place="bottom">See Earl of Chatham's ſpeech on the addreſs moved on the 9th of January, 1770, by the Duke of Ancaſter.</note>, <q rend="inline">"loaded as I am with infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I might, perhaps, have ſtood excuſed, if I had continued in retirement, and never taken a part again in public affairs. But the alarming ſtate of the nation forced me to come forward, once more, and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that duty which I owe to God, to my ſovereign, and to my country, and I am determined to perform it at the riſk of my life;"</q> and in theſe three points of view, it muſt be confeſſed, that he performed his vow as a man, an hereditary counſellor of the crown, and a patriot, nobly falling with a falling ſtate; but though he raiſed his voice to Heaven, and poured the balm of conciliation from his lips, that warning voice was not attended to, and his venerable figure, and the fire of his imagination, were the only things that ſeem to have made an impreſſion on thoſe that heard him. His Lordſhip's ſentiments, relative to America, were well known previous to that day. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, of that continent in the courſe of his
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:0244800201:40"/>
ſpeech, <q rend="inline">"He lamented the unhappy meaſure which had divided the colonies from the mother country, and which, he feared, had drawn them into exceſſes which he could not juſtify. He owned his natural partiality to America, and was inclined to make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance even for thoſe exceſſes; that they ought to be treated with tenderneſs; for in his ſenſe they were ebullitions of liberty, which broke out upon the ſkin, and were a ſign, if not of perfect health, at leaſt, of a vigorous conſtitution, and muſt not be driven in too ſuddenly, leaſt they ſhould ſtrike to the heart. He profeſſed himſelf entirely ignorant of the preſent ſtate of America, therefore ſhould be cautious of giving any opinion of the meaſures fit to be purſued with reſpect to that country. That it was a maxim he had obſerved through life, when he had loſt way, to ſtop ſhort, leſt by proceeding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge, and advancing (as he feared a noble Duke had done) from one falſe ſtep to another, he ſhould wind himſelf into an inextricable labyrinth, and never be able to recover the right road again. That as the Houſe had yet no materials before them, by which they might judge of the proceedings of the colonies, he ſtrongly objected to their paſſing that heavy cenſure upon them, which was conveyed in the word <hi>unwarrantable,</hi> contained in the propoſed addreſs; that it was paſſing a ſentence without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe, or being acquainted with facts; might expoſe the proceedings of the Houſe to be received abroad with indifference or diſreſpect; that if <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable</hi> meant any thing, it muſt mean illegal, and how could their Lordſhips decide that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which had not been ſtated to them in any ſhape, were contrary to law; that what he had heard of the combinations in America, and of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in ſupplying themſelves with goods of their own manufacture, had, indeed, alarmed him much for the commercial intereſts of the mother country; but he could not conceive in what ſenſe they could be
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:0244800201:41"/>
called illegal, much leſs how a declaration of that Houſe could remove the evil; that they were dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, indeed, and he greatly wiſhed to have that word ſubſtituted for unwarrantable; that the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of two millions of people deſerved conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the foundation of it ought to be removed; that this was the true way of putting a ſtop to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations and manufactures in that country; but that he reſerved himſelf to give his opinion more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon this ſubject, when authentic informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtate of America ſhould be laid before the Houſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"That we ſhould be cautious how we invaded the liberties of any part of our fellow-ſubjects, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever remote in ſituation, or unable to make reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; that liberty was a plant that deſerved to be cheriſhed; that he loved the tree, and wiſhed well to every branch of it; that like the vine in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it had ſpread from Eaſt to Weſt, had embraced whole nations with its branches, and ſheltered them under its leaves; that the Americans had purchaſed their liberty at a dear rate, ſince they had quitted their native country, and gone in ſearch of freedom to a deſert."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In 1772 and 1773, the Eaſt-India affairs were ſubmitted to the attention and conſideration of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; two committees were appointed to examine and report on this ſubject. The firſt was an open committee, and the ſecond a ſecret one. The former was very ſlow in their proceedings, and the latter very haſty. This contraſt furniſhed Mr. Burke with abundant pleaſantry. In diſcuſſing a ſubject of ſuch magnitude, he gave evident proofs that it was not beyond his reach; nay, that he was very intimate with the moſt intricate parts of it, but majorities triumphed over arguments.

in India for a time to be limited, Mr. Burke addreſſed the Chairman thus:—</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Mr. Bacon, you are every thing, but what you ſhould be; you are chairman of a committee in the air—we are a committee of imagination, of idea, of every thing but reality; and we might as well be employed in building caſtles in the air. But, Sir, I cannot help moſt ſeriouſly remarking, how amazingly the opinions of men change! What has now taken place is a ſpecial inſtance of it. When a propoſition comes originally from this ſide of the Houſe, it is heard with diſguſt, and treated with contempt; ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, however, accompany it, as convince even the antagoniſts of the idea: it paſſes through the political elaboratory; the ſun ſhines from the treaſury-bench on it; it is given to the Houſe, and heard with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. This, Sir, I have ſeen more than once; and any member who will take the trouble of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting what I have advanced more than once within theſe ten days, muſt alſo plainly perceive it now adopted, in a manner which ſhews the conviction of that bench but clogged, damned, with attendants which ſeem coined to deſtroy all the good that could reſult from the other. Why will not the noble Lord at once declare, or give up the right of the crown to the territorial acquiſitions? Why is that fantaſtic right to hang eternally over their heads, in order to deſtroy that very ſolidity which he affects to give the Company?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Sir, I was anſwered in a former committee, that I did not adhere to the queſtion; but, Sir, it was a reply of ignorance alone. If the propoſers of a motion will paſs the plain road that leads to common ſenſe, in order to wander into a rotten bog, the man who calls them back again, and tells them they will ſoon be up to the chin in that ground, is he the man who runs from the queſtion? The noble Lord, in order to come immediately to his motion, paſſes over the previous queſtion of right, the conſequence of which is, all his deductions are actions of abſurdity—
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:0244800201:43"/>
all his propoſitions ſtrings of contradictions. Let him declare that right, on the ſtrength of which he ſeizes with the hand of power, and the Houſe will ſupport him. If he gives it up, it will ſupport him. Let him offer a purge, you will ſwallow it—a vomit, it will go down—an alterative or aſtringent—an acid or an alkali—all one—down it goes. While the noble Lord finds we have ſuch a ſwallow, let him give the pill at once without gilding—let him fairly declare the degree of this accurſed right, which hangs thus in terrorem on your trade to the eaſt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Burke had now ſhone with encreaſing luſtre as the ſteady advocate of civil liberty, and, in order to compleat his character as a patriot and ſenator, he availed himſelf of the firſt opportunity to evince his attachment to the cauſe of religious liberty.</p>
               <p>On the eighteenth of February, 1773, Sir Harry Houghton moved for leave to bring in a bill for the relief of Proteſtant Diſſenters, in ſundry matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to ſubſcription. It was vehemently oppoſed by Sir William Baggot on two grounds, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the penal laws againſt ſuch of the Diſſenters as did not ſubſcribe were never put in force; and, ſecondly, becauſe he believed that the attempt to ſet aſide the thirty-nine articles was agitated with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign unfavourable to Chriſtianity, Mr. Burke, in reply, ſpoke nearly to the following effect:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I propoſe, Sir, taking notice of what fell from the honourable gentleman's lips, conſidered in a two-fold view. He advanced the following poſitions, that the Diſſenters now enjoyed liberty by connivance, and that toleration was an attack upon Chriſtianity.—The Diſſenters enjoy liberty by connivance! My good Sir, what ſort of liberty is this? What, Sir, is liberty by connivance but a temporary relaxation of ſlavery? Is this a ſort of liberty calculated for the meridian of England? Monteſquieu places liberty in an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from fear. Are perſons who enjoy it by conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance only—are they exempt from fear, and diveſted
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:0244800201:44"/>
of apprehenſion? To talk then, Sir, of a connivance, is to talk only of a temporary ſuſpenſion of tyranny. You are deſirous to keep the rod hanging over the Diſſenters' heads at the very inſtant that you aſſure them they ſhall never ſmart under its ſtripes. Why then at once not ſet their hearts at reſt, by removing the impending danger? Why not releaſe them from the dread of theſe penal ſtatutes, the cruelty of which ſo ſhocks your generous natures, that you think it incumbent on you to declare they never ſhould be put in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o execution? The queſtion, Sir, anſwers itſelf; and to cavil at its propriety is to carp at truth and elude conviction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"As to what the honourable gentleman let fall concerning toleration being an attack upon Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, it is an aſſertion ſo contrary to truth and hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that it ſcarcely ſtands in need of refutation. By toleration Chriſtianity flouriſhed. Whilſt the eaſtern and weſtern churches were tolerant, they were illuſtrious; they were venerated; they were held in ſacred eſtimation. When the Romiſh Church caſt aſide its toleration, and had recourſe to threatenings, ſlaughter and perſecutions; commotions enſued; eccleſiaſtical anarchy prevailed; and the kingdom of darkneſs was erected on the ruins of Chriſtianity. Inſtead of combating the common foe, Chriſtians combated each other. Inſtead of taking arms againſt the grand deceivers, they ſtrove by every deceptious art to harraſs and torment thoſe whom they ought to have cheriſhed and loved as brethren. In ſhort the want of toleration has leſſened the number of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and for that reaſon I would have all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants united, that we may be the better enabled to make a common cauſe againſt infidels of every deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The Church of England, Sir, has not a firmer friend than myſelf—I wiſh her illuſtrious—I wiſh her head may reach that Heaven to which ſhe would conduct us—But I would alſo wiſh her family as
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:0244800201:45"/>
numerous as poſſible—I would wiſh a brotherly affection to prevail among her offspring—I would have Chriſtians united—I would have them join in every attempt to cruſh the powers of darkneſs, and trample under foot the foe to God and man; like a mother, tender of her children, I would have the Church, with wide extended arms, receive in her boſom every believing ſon; not, with unnatural auſterity, reproach her offspring, and drive them to ſeek for eaſe, for pleaſure, and for comfort, in the harlot lap of infidelity."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſpeech made a great impreſſion in and out of doors, which is not to be wondered at, if we conſider the height from whence it fell; ſurely it was time that Religion ſhould ceaſe to be a crime, and that puniſhment ſhould not reach thoſe that were guilty of no other. Perſecution, as the late Earl of Mansfield ſaid, may make hypocrites and martyrs, but never made a real convert; and it is ſtrange that ſome perſons ſhould imagine that the thirty-nine articles of the Church of England ſhould be fenced with oaths and perjuries. This would be to plant reeds round an oak to defend it from a ſtorm. When penal laws are repealed in the heart, they ought not to be found on the ſtatute books.</p>
               <p>Sir Henry Houghton's motion was very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably received; leave was given to bring in the bill, which paſſed the Commons without a diviſion, but was loſt in the Houſe of Lords on the ſecond read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by a great majority.</p>
               <p>An act was paſſed on the 25th of March, 1774, called the Boſton Port Bill, which threw the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Maſſachuſett's into the greateſt conſternation. The town of Boſton paſſed a reſolution, expreſſing their ſenſe of this oppreſſive meaſure, and a deſire that all the colonies would concur to ſtop all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation from Great Britain. Moſt of the colonies entered into ſpirited reſolutions on this occaſion, to unite with Maſſachuſett's in a firm oppoſition to the unconſtitutional meaſures of the parliament. The
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:0244800201:46"/>
firſt of June, the day on which the Port Bill was to take place, was appointed to be kept as a day of humiliation, faſting, and prayer, throughout the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to ſeek the divine direction and aid, in that critical and gloomy junction of affairs.</p>
               <p>During the height of the conſternation and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which the Boſton Bort Bill occaſioned; at the very time when a town meeting was ſitting to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it, General Gage, who had been appointed to the government of Maſſachuſett's, arrived in the harbour. His arrival, however, did not allay the popular ferment, or check the progreſs of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then taking to unite the colonies, in oppoſition to the oppreſſive act of parliament.</p>
               <p>But the port bill was not the only act that alarmed the apprehenſion of the Americans. Determined to compel the province of Maſſachuſett's to ſubmit to their law, parliament paſſed an act for the better regulating government in the province of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett's Bay. The object of this act was to alter the government, as it ſtood in the charter of King Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, to take the appointment of the executive out of the hands of the people, and place it in the crown; thus making even the judges and ſheriffs dependent on the king, and removeable only at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>This act was ſoon followed by another, which ordained, that any perſon, indicted for murder, or other capital offence, committed in aiding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in executing the laws, might be ſent by the governor either to another colony, or to Great Britain, for his trial.</p>
               <p>This was ſoon followed by the Quebec Bill, which extended the bounds of that province, and granted many privileges to the Roman Catholics. The object of this bill was, to ſecure the attachment of that province to the crown of England, and prevent its joining the colonies in their reſiſtance to the laws of parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:0244800201:47"/>But theſe meaſures did not intimidate the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans. On the other hand, they ſerved to confirm their former apprehenſions of the evil deſigns of government, and to unite the colonies in their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p>A correſpondence of opinion with reſpect to the unconſtitutional acts of parliament, produced a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of proceedings in the colonies. The people generally concurred in a propoſition for holding a congreſs by deputation from the ſeveral colonies, in order to concert meaſures for the preſervation of their rights. Deputies were accordingly appointed, and met at Philadelphia, on the 26th October, 1774.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of April, 1774, Mr. Roſe Fuller, member for Rye, made the following motion; that an act made in the ſeventeenth year of the reign of his preſent majeſty, intituled,
<q rend="inline">"An act for granting cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain duties in the Britiſh colonies and plantations in America; for allowing a drawback of the duties of cuſtoms upon the exportation from this kingdom of coffee and cocoa-nuts, of the produce of the ſaid colonies or plantations; for diſcontinuing the drawbacks payable on china earthen ware exported to America; and for more effectually preventing the clandeſtine running of goods in the ſaid colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and plantations,"</q> might be read.</p>
               <p>And the ſame being read accordingly; he moved, <q rend="inline">"that this houſe will, upon this day ſe'nnight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve itſelf into a committee of the whole houſe, to take into conſideration the duty of 3d. per pound weight upon tea, payable in all his majeſty's dominions in America, impoſed by the ſaid act; and alſo the appropriation of the ſaid duty."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A warm and intereſting debate took place on the queſtion of American taxation, that, perhaps, to uſe Mr. Burke's expreſſion, no topic had been more familiar to the houſe. Mr. Wolfran Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall took a wide view of it, and when it was thought that the ſubject was entirely exhauſted, Mr.
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:0244800201:48"/>
Burke roſe, and, to the ſurprize of thoſe that were in the habits of admiring his powers, poured freſh light upon it—not that light that miſleads in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it dazzles, but the ſteady beam of reaſon and ſound argument that at once vivifies, charms, and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines all that was dark. In ſpeaking of the repeal of the ſtamp act, <q rend="inline">"I affirm,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"that when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the maxims of that repeal, you revived the ſcheme of taxation, and thereby filled the minds of the coloniſts with new jealouſy, and all ſorts of apprehenſions; then it was that they quarrelled with the old taxes, as well as the new; then it was, and not till then, that they queſtioned all the parts of your legiſlature; and by the battery of ſuch queſtions have ſhaken the ſolid ſtructure of this empire to its deepeſt foundations."</q> Mr. Burke followed up this aſſertion with ſuch damning proofs ariſing out of the very acts, and ſpeeches of miniſters themſelves, particularly in Lord Hillſborough's Letter to the American Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, dated May 13th, 1769, which he called the Canonical Book of Miniſterial Scripture, or the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Epiſtle to the Americans; well knowing that his arguments on this head were unanſwerable, he was reſolved not to omit the opportunity of a perſonal triumph. <q rend="inline">"Upon the principles therefore, ſaid he, of the honourable gentleman, (Mr. Cornwall) upon the principles of the miniſter himſelf, the miniſter has nothing at all to anſwer. He ſtands condemned by himſelf, and by all his aſſociates, old and new, as a deſtroyer in the firſt truſt of finance of the revenues; and in the firſt rank of honour, as a betrayer of the dignity of his country."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Burke, in the courſe of his ſpeech, made the following declaration.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"<hi>I will be content to be declared infamous, if I do not, to the laſt hour of my life, at all times, in all places, and upon all occaſions, exert every power with which I either am, or ever ſhall be legally inveſted, in order to obtain and</hi> maintain <hi>for the continent of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
                     <pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:0244800201:49"/>
                     <hi>that</hi> ſatisfaction <hi>which I have been authoriſed to promiſe this day, by the</hi> confidential <hi>ſervants of our gracious ſovereign, who to my certain knowledge rates his honour ſo high,</hi> that he would rather part with his crown, than preſerve it by deceit;"</q> and it is but juſtice to ſay, that he maintained his promiſe.</p>
               <p>Having ſhewn firſt on the narrow ground, which Mr. Cornwall meaſured, ſays he, that we were like to loſe nothing, by complying with the motion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what we had already loſt, that in time of peace we flouriſhed in commerce, and when war required it, had ſufficient aid from the colonies, as long as we purſued our ancient policy, that the ſtamp-act threw every thing into confuſion, and that the repeal of it reſtored every thing to peace and order. That the revival of the ſyſtem of taxation produced the very worſt effects, and that the partial repeal produced, not partial good, but univerſal evil. "Let theſe conſiderations, ſaid he, founded on facts, not one of which can be denied, bring us back to our reaſon by the road of our experience. But alas! this was the old beaten road which miniſters did not wiſh to tread, it was not ſufficiently ſtrewed with places and penſions. New paths muſt be ſtruck out, new turnpikes erected, and additional toll paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke concluded this very able and argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative ſpeech, with the following paſſage, which many have conſidered as the key-ſtone of the arch.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"On this buſineſs of America, I confeſs I am ſerious, <hi>even to ſadneſs.</hi> I have had but one opinion concerning it ſince I ſat, and before I ſat in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The noble lord will, as uſual, probably, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the part taken by me and my friends in this buſineſs, to a deſire of getting his place. Let him enjoy this happy and original idea. If I deprived him of it, I ſhould take away moſt of his wit, and all his argument. But I had rather bear the brunt of all his wit, and indeed blows much heavier, than ſtand anſwerable to God for embracing a ſyſtem that tends
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:0244800201:50"/>
to the deſtruction of ſome of the very beſt and faireſt of his works. But I know the map of England, as well as the noble lord<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord North.</note>, or as any other perſon; and I know that the way I take is not the road to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment. My excellent and honourable friend under me on the floor<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Dowdeſwell.</note>, has trod that road with great toil for upwards of twenty years together. He is not yet arrived at the noble lord's deſtination. However, the tracks of my worthy friend are thoſe I have ever wiſhed to follow; becauſe I know they lead to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Long may we tread the ſame road together; whoever may accompany us, or whoever may laugh at us on our journey! I honeſtly and ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, I have in all ſeaſons adhered to the ſyſtem of 1766, for no other reaſon, than that I think it laid deep in your trueſt intereſts—and that, by unlimiting the exerciſe, it fixes on the firmeſt foundations, a real, conſiſtent, well-grounded authority in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Until you come back to that ſyſtem, there will be no peace for England."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A gentleman of talents, who had the good fortune to be preſent at the delivery of this ſpeech, has pourtrayed it thus: <q rend="inline">"In this ſpeech he had occaſion to ſhew the original plan of government in taxing the colonies, and of courſe to exhibit the characters that were officially concerned, either in its progreſs or oppoſition. He began with the Right Honourable George Grenville, Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1763, and then proceeded to the characters of the late Lord Chatham, late Right Honourable Charles Townſhend, (Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1766, and the re-producer of the taxation ſcheme) the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Rockingham, and the late Field-Marſhall Conway, with many others. Some of theſe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who, when living, were in total oppoſition to Mr. Burke's political ſentiments on this ſubject; but now being dead, and their memories moreover being
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:0244800201:51"/>
warmly protected by many high perſonages as rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and friends, preſented a ſubject very difficult and delicate to expand upon. Lord Chatham too was ſtill living, and though rather in the wane of his great political powers, yet, ſurrounded by his former greatneſs, his accumulated wiſdom, and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, he ſtood as the great Mentor of oppoſition, to whom all the parts occaſionally looked up for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and protection. When we add to theſe, that the Marquis of Rockingham and Field-Marſhall Conway were his particular friends—the difficulties of reproving and praiſing became ſo multiplied, that the undertaking ſeemed to be one of thoſe traps which vanity ſometimes lays for great men, to ſhew them the extent of their own preſumption.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"But Mr. Burke's mind was fully equal to the taſk; all the leading and pleaſing features of thoſe great men who were his political opponents, he praiſed with a manly openneſs that would have done honour to the warmeſt and moſt exalted friendſhip; even what he thought of their defects he ſoftened in ſuch a manner, by either attributing them to original opinions, or early habits, or the co-operation of party, that thoſe moſt intimately attached to their memories could not be diſpleaſed with their general portraits."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The late Lord John Cavendiſh had retired with other members to the gallery during the delivery of this ſpeech, and at Mr. Burke's deſcription of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conway's feelings—Good God exclaimed his Lordſhip, <q rend="inline">"What a man is this!—How could he acquire ſuch tranſcendent powers?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>At the diſſolution of the parliament on the laſt day of September, 1774, Mr. Burke made his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Malton, but ſcarce was he returned, when a deputation from ſome of the moſt reſpectable Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Diſſenters in Briſtol invited him to ſtand for that city. He could not reſiſt ſo flattering an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, ſo that, to uſe George Selwyn's expreſſion, <q rend="inline">"he reſigned his little country wench for a fine city
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:0244800201:52"/>
dame, attired in the richeſt ſilks, and ſhowered with diamonds;"</q> but it ſhould not be forgotten that theſe ornaments were purchaſed at the expence of human blood. The candidates who ſtarted on this occaſion were Lord Clare, one of the late Repreſentatives, who declined on the ſecond day of the poll; Mr. Brickdale, and Mr. Cruger, an American merchant. Mr. Burke appeared on the Huſtings on the afternoon of the ſixth day's poll. His addreſs to the electors, was manly, candid, and captivating—and ſuch as might be expected from one, whom neither <q rend="inline">"avarice or ambition had juſtled out of the ſtraight line of duty."</q> The exertions of his friends were crowned with ſucceſs. It was certainly a very pleaſing ſight, to behold a man of Mr. Burke's ſenſibility ſtanding amidſt the unbought plaudits of the populace, dumb with gratitude, till his tears got the ſtart of his words—and as a gentleman, who was preſent, obſerved it was hard to ſay which of the two was the more eloquent. The opening of his addreſs was worthy of the man void of all affectation, it aroſe naturally from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the moment, and conveyed a fine compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the feelings of his colleague, Mr. Cruger—It ran thus:</p>

               <p>But how ſhould I appear to the <hi>voters</hi> themſelves? If I had gone round to the citizens intitled to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſqueezed them by the hand—

—If I were then to deliver them to my managers, pack them into tallies, vote them off in court, and when I heard from the bar—

—Whilſt theſe words were hardly out of my mouth, if I ſhould have wheeled round at once, and told them—

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Burke was extremely happy in the locality of his ſimiles during the election—witneſs the following:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"As for the trifling petulance, which the rage of party ſtirs up in little minds, though it ſhould ſhew itſelf even in this court, it has not made the ſlighteſt impreſſion on me.

               </p>
               <p>In this ſpeech Mr. Burke has drawn a picture of what he conceived to be the duty of a repreſentative to his conſtituents. The paſſage is too fine to be omitted or abridged, eſpecially as it is a point on which the ableſt writers are divided.</p>

               <p>Mr. Burke having found by experience that a <q rend="inline">"ſtrenuous reſiſtance to every appearance of lawleſs power; a ſpirit of independence carried to ſome degree of enthuſiaſm; an inquiſitive character to diſcover, and a bold one to diſplay, every corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and every error of government,"</q> had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to a ſeat for Briſtol, he was determined to perſevere in the ſame ſteady courſe.</p>
               <p>He had formed a moſt intimate friendſhip with Sir George Saville, that good man, who was very juſtly looked up to as the land-mark of the conſtitution, went to Ireland about this time, for the humane purpoſe of meliorating the condition of his numerous tenantry in that country. Having rode out one froſty morning without any attendant, he eſpied a man at a little diſtance, with whom he entered into converſation. Who does that mill belong to? I rent it, Sir. And what is the meaning that your mill is not better thatched, and yourſelf better clad?—I
<pb n="liii" facs="tcp:0244800201:57"/>
can't help it, Sir, I have a large family, and I aſſure you we do not eat the bread of idleneſs, but I pay a high rent. Who is your landlord? An Engliſhman, Sir, and one of the beſt men, Sir George Saville. Why, how much do you pay an acre? Fourteen ſhillings. What did you pay? Ten. Then take your bill, and write down ten, for I am your land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord. The poor man could only look up to Heaven, as much as to ſay, you are dropped from thence. Sir George made ſimilar deductions over all his eſtate, but he that was <q rend="inline">"eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame,"</q> was called too ſoon to receive the reward of his virtue.</p>
               <p>The public ſtatue of the late Sir George Saville is erected in York Cathedral.

His judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was now matured, and his fancy no longer ſoared on trembling pinions, but gazed ſtedfaſtly at the ſun, or built its <hi>aerie</hi> on the brow of the moſt arduous precipice. The American war was the theme of every tongue and every pen. Mr. Burke, as we have already obſerved, took a decided part in it.
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:0244800201:59"/>
He reſolved to make one more effort to extinguiſh the flames of civil diſcord, not even diſcouraged by the rejection of a bill brought into the upper Houſe by the Earl of Chatham, for ſettling the troubles in America. On the 22d of March, 1775, he brought forward his celebrated conciliatory propoſitions. His ſpeech on that occaſion was conciliation indeed, in the true ſpirit of conciliation, and may be truly termed his golden oration; though there is ſcarce a quotation in the whole, it may be ſaid to contain the ſpirit of all that ancient and modern writers have ſaid on the fitteſt means of allaying all thoſe turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions that civil war never fails to excite. As no man was better qualified to reſort to the <q rend="inline">"witneſs of time, the light of truth, the life of memory, and the meſſenger of antiquity,"</q> his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions were founded on the beſt rules of reaſon, and though they were neither dictated by the paſſions, nor addreſſed to the paſſions, yet there is a certain atherial warmth that pervades all the arguments which he adduced in ſupport of them, and, in many inſtances, they abound in all the bold <hi>relief</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Throughout the whole he ſeems to have had the advice of a celebrated ſtateſman in view, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Omnia ſunt in republica ſuaviſſime tractanda, arte quae leniat, non exaſperet: ſanet, non ulceret: moveat, no perturbeat, non perturbeat, animos civium.</hi>"</q> He put the dignity of Great Britain in one ſcale, and her conceſſion in the other, in order to prove that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation would add luſtre to both.</p>
               <p>In the opening of this ſpeech Mr. Burke deſcribes the progreſs of the diſcontents of the Americans, and his own conduct, in that approaching ſtorm:—</p>

                  <q rend="inline">"Surely"</q> ſays he, <q rend="inline">"it is an awful ſubject; or there is none ſo on this ſide of the grave. When I firſt had the honour of a ſeat in this Houſe, the affairs of that continent preſſed themſelves upon us, as the moſt important and moſt delicate object of parliamentary attention. My little ſhare in this great

deliberation oppreſſed me. I found myſelf a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker in a very high truſt; and having no ſort of reaſon to rely on the ſtrength of my natural abilities for the proper execution of that truſt, I was obliged to take more than common pains, to inſtruct myſelf in every thing which relates to our colonies. I was not leſs under the neceſſity of forming ſome fixed ideas, concerning the general policy of the Britiſh empire. Something of this ſort ſeemed to be indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible; in order, amidſt ſo great a fluctuation of paſſions and opinions, to concentre my thoughts; to ballaſt my conduct; to preſerve me from being blown about by every wind of faſhionable doctrine. I really did not think it ſafe, or manly, to have freſh principles to ſeek upon every freſh mail which ſhould arrive from America.</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"At that period, I had the fortune to find myſelf in perfect concurrence with a large majority in this Houſe. Bowing under that high authority, and penetrated with the ſharpneſs and ſtrength of that early impreſſion, I have continued ever ſince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt deviation, in my original ſentiments. Whether this be owing to an obſtinate perſeverance in error, or a religious adherence to what appears to me truth and reaſon, it is in your equity to judge.</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Sir, Parliament having an enlarged view of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, made, during this interval, more frequent changes in their ſentiments and their conduct, than could be juſtified in a particular perſon upon the contracted ſcale of private information. But though I do not hazard any thing approaching to a cenſure on the motives of former Parliaments to all thoſe alterations, one fact is undoubted; that under them the ſtate of America has been kept in continual agitation. Every thing adminiſtered as a remedy to the public complaint, if it did not produce, was at leaſt followed by an heightening of the diſtemper; until, by a variety of experiments, that important country has been brought into her preſent ſituation;
<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:0244800201:61"/>
—a ſituation which I will not miſcall, which I dare not name; which I ſcarcely know how to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in the terms of any deſcription."</q>

                        <p>New England was originally ſettled by a religious ſect, deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated puritans, who fled from the ſevere reſtraints impoſed upon diſſenters in the reign of King James I. Placed beyond the fear of control, they formed a ſyſtem of civil eccleſiaſtical government, exactly ſuited to their rigid notions. All their inſtitutions were marks of an enthuſiaſtic zeal of religion. Removed from the tyranny of one church, they vibrated to the other extreme, with an order to build up Chriſt's kingdom, in what they quaintly call, a howling wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they eſtabliſhed a tyranny of the ſevereſt kind over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and rights of their own ſociety, and by arbitrary decrees baniſhed thoſe who differed from them upon the moſt metaphyſical points. It was a law of the firſt ſettlers at Boſton, that none could be free men and entitled to vote for civil rulers, who were not in full communion with the church; and none could be admitted to full communion, without the recommendation of a clergyman. Theſe laws threw all the power of the ſtate into the hands of the clergy. It is equally aſtoniſhing and ridiculous to the poſterity of thoſe godly people, to find the church and ſtate, in the infancy of the ſettlement of America, rent with diſcord upon the ſimple queſtion, whether ſanctification precedes juſtification. Yet hundreds of councils were held upon this or ſimilar points, and a diſſent from the common opinion on ſuch trifling queſtions, was hereby puniſhable with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication and baniſhment.</p>
                        <p>But candor requires ſome apology to be made for them. Bigotry was not confined to the New England ſettlers, it was the characteriſtic of the age. The firſt ſettlers in New Jerſey, Virginia and Pennſylvania, and indeed in moſt of the colonies, prohibited witchcraft under penalty of death; though the laws ſeem not to have been executed any where except in Maſſachuſetts. But the ſame gloomy ſuperſtition reigned in England. The ſtatutes of Henry VIII. and James I. making witchcraft and ſorcery felony without benefit of clergy, upon which many perſons ſuffered death, were not repealed, till the ninth year of George II. or about 1736. Juſt before the reſtoration in 1660, no leſs than thirteen gypſies were condemned at one Suffolk aſſizes, and executed.</p>

                  </note>. Mr. Burke touched on this ſtring, and with the finger of a maſter too. (<hi>See page</hi> 21.) The predominant feature of their character was a love of liberty; they ſought it in the midſt of
<pb n="lviii" facs="tcp:0244800201:62"/>
deſerts; religion went before them like a pillar of light, ſomewhat clouded, it is true, and the ſongs of Zion ſoothed the wild murmurs of the Ohio.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke points out in what manner the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the coloniſts (<hi>See page</hi> 24 <hi>and</hi> 41) contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <q rend="inline">"the growth and effect of their untractable ſpirit,"</q> and that the ſtudy of the law, ſo prevalent in that country, rendered <q rend="inline">"men acute, inquiſitive, dextrous, prompt in attack, ready in defence, and full of reſources."</q> He then adverts to the religion of the country (<hi>See page</hi> 23) after which he deſcribes the chief branches of their religion, which ought to be remembered as a piece of hiſtory, independent of its eloquence. <q rend="inline">"The Roman Catholic religion,"</q> ſays he, <q rend="inline">"is, at leaſt, coeval with moſt of the governments where it prevails; that it has generally gone hand in hand with them, and received great favour and every kind of ſupport from authority. The Church of England was formed from her cradle under the nurſing care of regular government. But the diſſenting intereſts have ſprung up in direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to all the ordinary powers of the world, and could juſtify that oppoſition only on a ſtrong claim to natural liberty. Their very exiſtence depended on the powerful and unremitted aſſertion of that claim. All Proteſtantiſm, even the moſt cold and paſſive, is a ſort of diſſent. But the religion moſt prevalent in our northern colonies, is a refinement on the principle of reſiſtance, it is the diffidence of diſſent, and the Proteſtantiſm of Proteſtantiſm.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The religion, under a variety of denominations, agreeing in nothing but in the communion of the ſpirit of liberty, is predominant in moſt of the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern provinces, where the Church of England, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its legal rights, is, in reality, no more than a ſort of private ſect, not compoſing, moſt probably, the tenth of the people. The coloniſts left England when this ſpirit was high, and in the emigrants was the higheſt of all."</q> He then ſhews
<pb n="lix" facs="tcp:0244800201:63"/>
that the ſpirit of liberty was ſtill more high and haughty in the ſouthern than in the northern ſtates, and the reaſons he aſſigns, in ſupport of this aſſertion, are not leſs ingenious than true. <q rend="inline">"It is,"</q> ſays he, <q rend="inline">"that in Virginia and the Carolinas, they have a vaſt multitude of ſlaves. Where this is the caſe in any part of the world, thoſe who are free, are by far the moſt proud and jealous of their freedom. Freedom is to them not only an enjoyment, but a kind of rank and privilege. Not ſeeing there, that freedom, as in countries where it is a common bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and as broad and general as the air, may be united with much abject toil, with great miſery, with all the exterior of ſervitude, liberty looks, amongſt them, like ſomething that is more noble and liberal. I do not mean, Sir, to commend the ſuperior mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of this ſentiment, which has, at leaſt, as much pride as virtue in it; but I cannot alter the nature of man. The fact is ſo; and theſe people of the ſouthern colonies are much more ſtrongly, and with an higher and more ſtubborn ſpirit, attached to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty than thoſe to the northward. Such were all the ancient commonwealths; ſuch were our Gothic anceſtors; ſuch in our days were the Poles; and ſuch will be all maſters of ſlaves, who are not ſlaves themſelves. In ſuch a people the haughtineſs of domination combines with the ſpirit of freedom, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies it, and renders it invincible."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He then remarks on the rapid population of the coloniſts (<hi>See page</hi> 11) ſo rapid that whilſt they were diſputing about the exaggeration of it, the exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ended, becauſe they grew to it. Having ſtated what may be called the biography of the Americans, he proceeds to the natural reſources of that country.

                  <q rend="inline">"It is ſometimes as hard to perſuade ſlaves to be free, as it is to compel freemen to be ſlaves; and in this auſpicious ſcheme, we ſhould have both theſe pleaſing taſks on our hands at once.

An offer of freedom from England, would come rather oddly, ſhipped to them in an African veſſel, which is refuſed an entry into the ports of Virginia or Carolina, with a cargo of three hundred Angola negroes.

alive whoſe memory might touch the two extremities. For inſtance, my Lord Bathhurſt might remember all the ſtages of the progreſs. He was in 1704 of an age, at leaſt to be made to comprehend ſuch things. He was then old enough <hi>acta parentum jam legere, et qua ſit poterit cognoſcere virtus</hi>—Suppoſe, Sir, that the angel of this auſpicious youth, foreſeeing the many virtues, which made him one of the moſt amiable, as he is one of the moſt fortunate men of his age, had opened to him in viſion, that when, in the fourth generation, the third prince of the Houſe of Brunſwick had ſat twelve years on the throne of that nation, which (by the happy iſſue of moderate and healing councils) was to be made Great Britain, he ſhould ſee his ſon Lord Chancellor of England, turn back the current of hereditary dignity to its fountain, and raiſe him to an higher rank of peerage, whilſt he enriched the family with a new one—If amidſt theſe bright and happy ſcenes of domeſtic honour and proſperity, that angel ſhould have drawn up the curtain, and unfolded the riſing glories of his country, and whilſt he was gazing with admiration on the then commercial grandeur of England, the genius ſhould point out to him a little ſpeck, ſcarce viſible in the maſs of the national intereſt, a ſmall ſeminal principle, rather than a formed body, and ſhould tell him—<q rend="inline">"Young man, there is America—which, at this day, ſerves for little more than to amuſe you with ſtories of ſavage men, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth manners, yet ſhall, before you taſte of death, ſhew itſelf equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world, rapidly advancing in a progreſſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of improvement, brought in by varieties of people, by ſucceſſion of civilizing conqueſts and civilizing ſettlements, in a ſeries of ſeventeen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, you ſhall ſee as much added to her by America in the courſe of a ſingle life!"</q> If this ſtate of his country had been foretold to him, would it not require all the ſanguine credulity of youth, and

all the fervid glow of enthuſiaſm, to make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it? Fortunate man, he has lived to ſee it! For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, indeed, if he lives to ſee nothing that ſhall vary the proſpect, and cloud the ſetting of his day!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl of Chatham, on being aſked his opinion of this ſpeech, anſwered, <q rend="inline">"It is ſeaſonable, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and eloquent;"</q> and now that I have mentioned this great ſtateſman, perhaps the reader would like to ſee a few extracts from his own ſpeech on the ſame ſubject, nearly as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I therefore urge and conjure your lordſhips immediately to adopt this conciliating meaſure. I will pledge myſelf for its immediately producing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliatory effects, by its being thus well timed: but if you delay till your vain hope ſhall be accompliſhed, of triumphantly dictating reconciliation, you delay for ever. But, admitting that this hope, which, in truth, is deſperate, ſhould be accompliſhed, what do you gain by the impoſition of your victorious amity? You will be untruſted and unthanked. Adopt, then, the grace, while you have the opportunity of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement, or, at leaſt, prepare the way. Allay the ferment prevailing in America, by removing the obnoxious, hoſtile cauſe—obnoxious and unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for the merit can be only in action: <hi>Non dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care et vincere,</hi> their victory can never be by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their force would be moſt diſproportionately exerted againſt a brave, generous, and united people, with arms in their hands, and courage in their hearts: Three millions of people, the genuine deſcendants of a valiant and pious anceſtory, driven to thoſe deſerts by the narrow maxims of a ſuperſtitious tyranny. And is the ſpirit of perſecution never to be appeaſed? Are the brave ſons of thoſe brave forefathers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit their ſufferings, as they have inherited their virtues? Are they to ſuſtain the infliction of the moſt oppreſſive and unexampled ſeverity, beyond the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of hiſtory, or deſcription of poetry: <q rend="inline">"<hi>Rhada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus habet duriſſima regna, caſtigatque, auditque.</hi>"</q>

So ſays the wiſeſt poet, and, perhaps, the wiſeſt ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and politician. But our miniſters ſay, the Americans muſt not be heard. They have been condemned unheard. The indiſcriminate hand of vengeance has lumped together innocent and guilty; with all the formalities of hoſtility, has blocked up the town<note n="*" place="bottom">Boſton,</note>, and reduced to beggary and famine thirty thouſand inhabitants.</q>

Their ſituation is truly unworthy; penned up, pining in inglorious inactivity. They are an army of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. You may call them an army of ſafety and of guard, but they are, in truth, an army of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and contempt, and, to make the folly equal to the diſgrace, they are an army of irritation and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</q>

The ſpirit which now reſiſts your taxation in America, is the ſame which formerly oppoſed loans, benevolences, and ſhip-money, in England; the ſame ſpirit which called all England on its legs, and by the bill of rights, vindicated the Engliſh conſtitution; the ſame ſpirit which eſtabliſhed the great, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, eſſential maxim of your liberties, that no ſubject of England ſhall be taxed but by his own conſent."</q>
               </p>
               <p>As the American war is now become a matter of hiſtory, and can be uſeful and inſtructive only in that point of view, we ſhall leave it to the hiſtorian, and only touch on it merely to ſhew the part that Mr. Burke took in it. In all wars a great deal is to be left to the chapter of accidents. Mr. Burke ſeems to have left as little to it as poſſible in all his calculations on that momentous ſubject. In his very outſet on this queſtion, he appears to have examined it with great caution and judgment, and the <hi>cauſe</hi> only ſeems to have intereſted him, for he ſays himſelf, in his ſpeech at Briſtol in 1780, <q rend="inline">"That the Americans were utter ſtrangers to <hi>him,</hi> a nation amongſt whom <hi>he</hi> was not ſure <hi>he</hi> had a ſingle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance."</q> Under theſe impreſſions, as often as this conteſt was agitated, he never failed to call forth freſh arguments and additional reprobation of it. Every aid that the human intellect and unwearied induſtry could furniſh, were at his devotion. Even ſcurrility furniſhed her ſilth, and wit her poignant darts; every one as pointed as the Parthian arrow, and as rapid as its flight. If the Premier chanced to nod, Mr. Burke's imagination furniſhed him with dreams of ſplendid victories, and the interpretation of them into the bargain. In ſhort, he excelled the miniſter in every thing but good humour and majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. Money has been conſidered, but too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, as the ſinews of war. The American coffers were exhauſted, nor did Congreſs diſguiſe their

Every day witneſſed the depreciation of their paper credit, 'till at length it fell, like the leaves of their native woods in autumn. Mr. Burke ſaw this, but, at the ſame time, he ſaw the buds of future credit; he did not wiſh to chill them, but he wiſhed that England ſhould ſhare the promiſed fruit, as friends, and that they ſhould not be plucked with the rude hand of power. In ſhort, ſo early as the year 1777, he ſeems to have ſeen with a prophetic eye, the reſult of what time has confirmed: <q rend="inline">"America,"</q> ſaid he, at that period, <q rend="inline">"is not ſubdued. Not one unattacked village which was originally adverſe throughout that vaſt continent, has yet ſubmitted from love or terror. You have the ground you encamp on, and you have no more. The canton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your troops and your dominions are exactly of the ſame extent. You ſpread devaſtation, but you do not enlarge the ſphere of authority."</q>
               </p>
               <p>At the opening of the ſeſſion in October, 1776, oppoſition attended almoſt to a man, in hopes that the miniſter had profitted from experience in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, eſpecially as he ſaw that ſeveral of his favourite plans to bring the Americans to their <hi>ſenſes,</hi> as he called it, had failed, were failing, and ought to be relinquiſhed. But it is with ſtates as it is with indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, there is a ſeaſon when arguments will not avail. Mr. Burke and his party felt this; their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance became more lax, and a ſeceſſion was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and, as it was not generally approved, he ſtates the grounds on which it was diſapproved, and does juſtice to thoſe who ſtood on that ground; <q rend="inline">"They queſtioned,"</q> he ſays, <q rend="inline">"whether any
<pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:0244800201:71"/>
member could, conſiſtently with his duty, withdraw himſelf individually from the buſineſs of parliament, merely from an opinion that he would be outvoted, and that his attendance would, therefore, be uſeleſs. They acknowledged that a ſeceſſion, collectively in a body, had not only the ſanction of precedent, but might be practiſed with great advantage, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of much benefit in ſuch caſes as the preſent. But for this purpoſe, it muſt be attended with the following circumſtances: In the firſt place it muſt be general, including the whole minority, againſt the meaſure that provoked the ſeceſſion; and, in the next, it ſhould not be a ſilent act, but the motives for the ſeceſſion ſhould be proclaimed, either by a remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance on the journals, or a public addreſs to the people. Under theſe circumſtances, and in caſes of imminent danger to the conſtitution, a ſeceſſion might operate as a call to the nation, and awaken people to a ſenſe of their ſituation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Burke tried every means that argument and perſuaſion could ſuggeſt, to point out the propriety and neceſſity of ſuch a ſtep, and to remove every ſcruple on that head, and in order to haſten the unanimity, he drew up a paper on the ſubject, in the ſhape of a remonſtrance, in order that it might find its way on the journals; we ſhall only ſay, that if it had been put and carried in that form, it would have illumined thoſe Belgic folios. It would have ſerved as a precedent on all ſuch emergent occaſions. It would have ſerved as a faithful record in which miniſters might learn, that truth, in the end, will prevail over venal majorities. It was thought ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable, however, to convey the ſubſtance of it in an addreſs to the King, and, if this propoſition had been adopted, perhaps a more reſpectful and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate addreſs never was conveyed to the foot of the throne. It will remain as long as the Engliſh language laſts, as a monument of the powers and beauties of that tongue, and the uſe which the writer

knew how to make of them, independent of the force of the arguments, and the happy manner in which they are arranged. The firſt paragraph is filled with expreſſions of unfeigned loyalty, of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the ſovereign, and his true intereſt. The ſecond runs thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"A ſituation without example, neceſſitates a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct without precedent. We are driven in this mode of addreſſing your Majeſty, reluctantly, to ſuperſede thoſe forms which, in other circumſtances, we ſhould highly reſpect; and regulate ourſelves by no other rules than thoſe of our laws, our rights, and the profound reverence we bear to our ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The third contains an apology for the propoſed ſeceſſion, on the grounds of the preſervation of their (the ſeceders) honour, and what ſtood next in their eſtimation, his Majeſty's good opinion, and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibly perſevering in their diſſent from every part of thoſe proceedings, on the experience of their miſchief, which they originally gave, from a ſure foreſight of their unhappy and inevitable tendency.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">"We deplore, (ſay they) along with your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, the diſtractions and diſorders which prevail in your empire. But we are convinced, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the people, in the preſent time, are owing to the uſual and natural cauſe of ſuch diſorders at all times—the miſconduct of government; <hi>that they are owing to plans laid in error, purſued with obſtinacy, and conducted without wiſdom.</hi> We cannot attribute ſo much to the power of faction at the expence of human nature, as to ſuppoſe, that a combination of men, few in number, not conſiderable in rank, of no natural hereditary dependencies, of talents, which, however reſpectable, appear to be no way uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly impoſing, ſhould, by the efforts of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy alone, be able to bring the people of your Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican dominions into the diſpoſition which has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the preſent troubles. We cannot conceive,

that, without ſome powerful concurring cauſe, any management ſhould prevail on ſome millions of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſperſed over a whole continent, in thirteen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, not only unconnected, but in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of religion, manners, government, and local in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, totally different and adverſe, voluntarily to ſubmit themſelves to a ſuſpenſion of all the profits of induſtry, and all the comforts of civil life, added to all the evils of an unequal war, carried on with circumſtances of the greateſt aſperity and rigour. This, Sire, could never have happened but from a general ſenſe of ſome grievance, ſo radical in its nature, and ſo ſpreading in its effects, as to poiſon all the ordinary ſatisfactions of life, to diſlocate the frame of ſociety, and to convert into fear and hatred that habitual reverence ever paid by mankind to an ancient and venerable government.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"That grievance is as ſimple in its nature, and as level to the moſt ordinary underſtanding, as it is powerful in affecting the moſt languid paſſions. It is an attempt made to diſpoſe of the whole property of a whole people, without their conſent."</q>

               <p>Having depreciated this ſcheme ſet up in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the rooted and inveterate prejudices of the whole people of America, they proceed to the following reflections, highly worthy the conſideration of every ſtateſman.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The ſenſe of a whole people, moſt gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, never ought to be contemned by wiſe and beneficent rulers, whatever may be the abſtract claims, or even rights <hi>of the ſupreme power.</hi> We have been too early inſtructed, and too long habituated to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the only firm ſeat of all authority, is in the minds, affections, and intereſts of the people, to change our ſentiments for the convenience of a temporary arrangement of ſtate. It is not conſiſtent with equity or wiſdom, to ſet at defiance the general feelings of great communities, and all the orders which compoſe them. Much power is tolerated, and
<pb n="lxx" facs="tcp:0244800201:74"/>
paſſes unqueſtioned, where much is yielded to opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. All is diſputed, where every thing is enforced. This is the tenet we hold on the duty and policy of conforming to the prejudices of a whole people, even where the foundation of ſuch prejudices may be falſe or diſputable. But, permit us to lay at your Majeſty's feet, our deliberate judgment on the real merits of <hi>that</hi> principle, the violation of which is the known ground and origin of theſe troubles. We aſſure your Majeſty, that, on our parts, we ſhould think ourſelves unworthy of life, which we only value for the means of ſpending it in honour and virtue, if we ever ſubmitted to taxes, to which we did not conſent, either directly, or by a repreſentation <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory</hi> to the body of the people. And we add, Sire, that if fortune, inſtead of bleſſing us with a ſituation where we may have daily acceſs to the propitious preſence of a gracious prince, had fixed us in ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the remoteſt part of the globe, we muſt carry theſe ſentiments with us, as part of our being; perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ded, that the diſtance of ſituation would only render this privilege the more neceſſary, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of property. Abuſes of ſubordinate authority increaſe, and all means of redreſs leſſen, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the ſubject removes him from the ſeat of the ſupreme power. What, in thoſe circumſtances, can ſave him from the laſt extremes of indignity and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, but ſomething left in his own hands, which may enable him to conciliate the favour, and controul the exceſſes of government? When no means are poſſeſſed of power to awe, or to oblige, the ſtrongeſt ties which connect mankind in every relation, ſocial and civil, and which teach them mutually to reſpect each other, are broken. Independency, from that moment, virtually exiſts. Its formal declaration will quickly follow. Such muſt be our feelings for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. We are not in poſſeſſion of another rule for our brethren. When the late attempt, practically to annihilate that privilege was made, great diſorders
<pb n="lxxi" facs="tcp:0244800201:75"/>
and tumults very unhappily and very naturally aroſe from it. In this ſtate of things, we were of opinion, that ſatisfaction ought inſtantly to be given, or that at leaſt the puniſhment of the diſorder, ought to be attended with the redreſs of the grievance.</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"Becauſe, whenever a diſorder ariſes from, and is directly connected with a grievance, to confine our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the puniſhment of the diſorder, is to declare againſt the reaſon and juſtice of the complaint."</q>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"This mode of proceeding, by harſh laws and feeble armies, could not be defended on the principle of mercy and forbearance. For mercy, as we conceive, conſiſts not in the weakneſs of the means, but in the benignity of the ends. We apprehend, that mild meaſures may be powerfully enforced; and that acts of extreme rigour and injuſtice may be attended with as much feebleneſs in the execution, as ſeverity in the formation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The concluding part of this addreſs cannot be too highly eſteemed by every lover of his king and country, particularly the following paſſages:</p>
               <p>

The people re-entered into their original rights, and it was not becauſe a poſitive law authorized the act, but becauſe the freedom and ſafety of the ſubject, the origin and cauſe of all laws, required a proceeding paramount and ſuperior to them.

               <p>This addreſs, which may be conſidered as the creed of the Rockingham party, was not carried into effect. Mr. Burke was, however, determined that it ſhould meet the public eye in ſome form or other. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for transfuſed the ſpirit of it, in a letter which he addreſſed to John Farr and John Harris, Eſquires, Sheriffs of Briſtol, on the affairs of America in 1777. No man but himſelf, perhaps, could have transfuſed that ſpirit with ſo much art, for every ſubject ſeemed to be as obedient to his touch as the clay to the plaſtic hand of the potter; in ſhort, his pen, on almoſt every occaſion, may be compared to the fabled wand of the old magicians.</p>
               <p>Attempts were made to drag even the private cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of thoſe that oppoſed the American war through all the filth and dirt of the miniſterial prints. Mr. Burke, in this letter, defends thoſe that oppoſed
<pb n="lxxiv" facs="tcp:0244800201:78"/>
thoſe ruinous meaſures. He conceived that it would be happy for us, if the coloniſts were taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there was even a formed American party in England, to whom they could look for ſupport. <q rend="inline">"Happy would it be for us, if in all tempers, they might turn their eyes to the parent ſtate, ſo that their very turbulence and ſedition ſhould find vent in no other place than this."</q> He then comes to his own defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I am charged with being an American. If warm affection towards thoſe over whom I claim any ſhare of authority, be a crime, I am guilty of this charge. But I do aſſure you (and they who know me publicly and privately well bear witneſs to me) that if ever one man lived, more zealous than another, for the ſupremacy of parliament, and the rights of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial crown, it was myſelf. Many others, indeed, might be more knowing in the extent of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe rights. I do not pretend to be an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary, a lawyer, or qualified for the chair of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor in metaphyſics. I never ventured to put your ſolid intereſts upon ſpeculative grounds. My having conſtantly declined to do ſo has been attributed to my incapacity for ſuch diſquiſitions; and I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe it is partly the cauſe. I never ſhall be aſhamed to confeſs, that where I am ignorant I am diffident. I am, indeed, not very ſolicitous to clear myſelf of this imputed incapacity; becauſe men, even leſs converſant than I am, in this kind of ſubtleties, and placed in ſtations, to which I ought not to aſpire, have, by the mere force of civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, often conducted the affairs of great nations with diſtinguiſhed felicity and glory."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having given his opinion on the then ſtate of public affairs," <q rend="inline">"I feel warmly,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"on this ſubject, and expreſs myſelf as I feel. I am too old, too ſtiff, in my inveterate partialities, to be ready at all the faſhionable evolutions of opinion. I ſcarce know how to adapt my mind to the feelings with
<pb n="lxxv" facs="tcp:0244800201:79"/>
which the court gazettes mean to impreſs the people. It is not inſtantly that I can be brought to rejoice, when I hear of the ſlaughter and captivity of long liſts of thoſe names, which have been familiar to my ears from my infancy, and to rejoice that they have fallen under the ſword of ſtrangers, whoſe barbarous appellations I ſcarcely know how to pronounce. The glory acquired at the white plains by Colonel Roaille, has no charms for me; and I fairly acknowledge, that I have not yet learned to delight in finding Fort Kniphauſen in the heart of the Britiſh dominions."</q> In other inſtances, as often as he touched on German mercenaries, his warmth kindled into indignation, his paſſions flew to arms, and, in the conflict, it was ſeldom that the petty princes of Germany themſelves, eſcaped with a ſtring of epithets as long as their titles.</p>
               <p>Towards the concluſion of this letter, the writer combats, with great force and eloquence, the doctrine which every venal miniſter has endeavoured to diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, namely, <q rend="inline">"that every man has his price;"</q> that the reader may judge for himſelf, we ſhall lay an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of the paſſage before him.</p>

I have been deceived, ſay they, by Titius and Maevius; I have been the dupe of this pretender, or of that mountebank; and I can truſt appearances no longer. But my credulity and want of diſcernment cannot, as I conceive, amount to a fair preſumption againſt any man's integrity. A conſcientious perſon would rather doubt his own judgment, than condemn his ſpecies. He would ſay, I have obſerved without attention, or judged upon erroneous maxims; I truſted to profeſſion, when I ought to have attended to conduct. Such a man will grow wiſe, not malignant, by his acquaintance with the world. But he that accuſes all mankind of corruption, ought to remember, that he is ſure to convict only one. In truth, I ſhould rather admit thoſe whom at any time I have diſreliſhed the moſt, to be patterns

               <p>This letter found a ready reception with thoſe who were already diſpoſed to ſubſcribe to the contents of it; they did not fail to magnify it as a piece of ſound political reaſoning and manly ſenſe—It was read with great avidity by all parties. Lord Abingdon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſome animadverſions on it.

               <p>On the return of the Speaker, he received the thanks of the Houſe for his ſpeech, and it was ordered to be printed. Mr. Burke, ſpeaking of it to a friend, ſaid, that the conſtitutional ſentiments which it contained were only equalled by the dignity of the manner in which they were delivered.</p>
               <p>Hitherto Mr. Burke had lived in the warmeſt friendſhip with the majority of his conſtituents; they approved his parliamentary conduct; and this, if we may truſt his own words, was the higheſt meed he looked for; but a period was now at hand that was to put that mutual friendſhip to trial. He had taken a decided part in the ſupport of two bills relative to the trade of Ireland in 1778, the truth is, he only attempted to awaken the long neglected Iriſh harp, every ſtring of which had been once in tune<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir John Davis mentions the proſperous ſtate of Ireland in his days, which he aſcribed to the <q rend="inline">"encouragement given to the maritime towns and cities, as well to encreaſe the trade of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, as to cheriſh mechanical arts,"</q> and the conſequence of which was, ſays he, <q rend="inline">"that the ſtrings or the Iriſh harps were all in tune."</q>
                  </note>, not at the expence of the Britiſh lyre, but that the notes of both might flow into all <q rend="inline">"the concord of ſweet ſounds,"</q> and that the hearts of both nations might dance to the muſic, but his endeavours were not taken in this point of view, the reſult of which was, that he wrote a letter to Samuel Span, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
                  <hi>Maſter of the Society of Merchants Adventurers of Briſtol,</hi> in which he vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
<pb n="lxxviii" facs="tcp:0244800201:82"/>
his conduct, and pointed out the advantages that his conſtituents would reap from the adoption of even a more liberal ſyſtem of commerce, and that under this conviction he had given it all the ſupport in his power. The language was plain; he knew that he was addreſſing it to a body of men, the major part of whom did not place ſo high a value upon tropes and figures as they did upon the ſhining toys and trinkets which they exported to the coaſts of Africa.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke ſaw that America was on the verge of being loſt, and he wiſhed to find an America nearer home. He deſcribes the ſtate of England, at that period, in theſe lines:—</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Perhaps Gentlemen are not yet fully aware of the ſituation of their country, and what its exigencies abſolutely require. I find that we are ſtill diſpoſed to talk at our eaſe, and as if all things were to be regulated by our good pleaſure. I ſhould conſider it as a fatal ſymptom, if, in our preſent diſtreſſed and adverſe circumſtances, we ſhould perſiſt in the errors which are natural only to proſperity. One cannot, indeed, ſufficiently lament the continuance of that ſpirit of deluſion, by which, for a long time paſt, we have thought fit to meaſure our neceſſities by our inclinations. Moderation, prudence, and equity, are far more ſuitable to our condition, than loſtineſs, and confidence, and rigour. We are threatened by enemies of no ſmall magnitude, whom, if we think fit, we may deſpiſe, as we have deſpiſed others; but they are enemies who can only ceaſe to be truly formidable, by our entertaining a due reſpect for their power. Our danger will not be leſſened by our ſhutting our eyes to it; nor will our force abroad be encreaſed by rendering ourſelves feeble, and divided at home.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"There is a dreadful ſchiſm in the Britiſh nation. Since we are not able to re-unite the empire, it is our buſineſs to give all poſſible vigour and ſoundneſs to

               </p>
               <p>Having lamented that his conduct had given his conſtituents any uneaſineſs, he declares, that he would much rather run the riſque of diſpleaſing than injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. <q rend="inline">"If I am driven,"</q> ſays he, <q rend="inline">"to make ſuch an option, you obligingly lament, that you are not to have me for your advocate; but if I had been capable of acting as an advocate in oppoſition to a plan ſo perfectly conſonant to my known principles, and to the opinions I had publicly declared on an hundred occaſions, I ſhould only diſgrace myſelf, without ſupporting, with the ſmalleſt degree of credit or effect, the cauſe you wiſhed me to undertake. I ſhould have loſt the only thing which can make ſuch abilities as mine of any uſe to the world now or hereafter; I mean that authority which is derived from an opinion, that a member ſpeaks the language of truth and ſincerity; and that he is not ready to take up or lay down a great political ſyſtem for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the hour; that he is in parliament to ſupport his opinion of the public good, and does not form his opinion in order to get into parliament, or to continue in it. It is, in a great meaſure, for your ſake, that I wiſh to preſerve this character. Without it, I am ſure, I ſhould be ill able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, by any ſervice, the ſmalleſt part of that debt of gratitude and affection, which I owe you for the great and honourable truſt you have repoſed in me."</q>

               </p>
               <p>When Mr. Burke found that miniſters were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to perſevere in one of the moſt diſaſtrous wars in which this country was ever engaged, and that the people began to bend beneath the weight of taxes, he reſolved to ſee if it was poſſible to render the public any ſervice. It ſtruck him that there was one path in which he might move with ſome degree of ſucceſs, and that was oeconomy. He had attempted it before, and failed, but he was determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the attack with additional force. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſaw that it was a popular meaſure, and capable of great modification. Accordingly, on the 11th of February, 1780, he brought in a bill for <q rend="inline">"the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Majeſty's civil eſtabliſhments, and of certain public offices; for the limitations of penſions, and the ſuppreſſion of ſundry uſeleſs, expenſive, and inconvenient places, and for applying the monies ſaved thereby to the public ſervice."</q> This bill was not ſo formidable in its contents as in its title, and the Honourable mover took care to ſoften the rigid features of it in a ſpeech of conſiderable length. Lord North received it with great ſeeming cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. He aſſured the Houſe, that no member in it was more zealous for the eſtabliſhment of a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſyſtem of oeconomy than himſelf; but, as among the various ſubjects treated of, ſome of them reſpected the King's patrimonial income, he thought the crown ought to be conſulted before the bill was admitted. Colonel Barré paſſed the higheſt enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums
<pb n="lxxxi" facs="tcp:0244800201:85"/>
on the ability, aſſiduity, extenſive knowledge and comprehenſive genius of his honourable friend Mr. Burke. The late Lord George Gordon thought the houſe ought not to entertain it, and though he ſtood alone, divided the houſe upon it. Mr. Burke hailed this as a lucky omen, but was prudent enough to keep within the limits, which he had preſcribed to himſelf in the outſet. It was not his intention even to attempt to cleanſe the augean ſtable, or to pluck up corruption by the root, that very corruption which he himſelf called the dry-rot of the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The ſubject was apparently barren, and it was not expected that even Mr. Burke could enliven it, but the houſe was very agreeably diſappointed—in his hand it became ſo fertile, that to continue the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor it ſhot in many places into luxuriancy. In the courſe of his ſpeech it was neceſſary that he ſhould point out the uſe and abuſe of certain offices, this was a point of great perſonal delicacy, in which he was very ſucceſsful; ſpeaking of the neceſſity of the propoſed meaſure, his words are worthy of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. <q rend="inline">"There is a time,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"when men will not ſuffer bad things, becauſe their anceſtors have ſuffered worſe. There is a time, when the hoary head of inveterate abuſe will neither draw reverence nor obtain protection."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The king of France at that time had ſeriouſly turned his attention to a reform in the finances of his country, joined to a reform in his court.<note n="*" place="bottom">By the edict of the king of France, regiſtered the 26th of Auguſt, <hi>four hundred and ſix</hi> places in this court were ſuppreſſed.</note> Mr. Burke took notice of this, and deſcanted on it in the following ſtrain: <q rend="inline">"The Miniſter, (Neckar) who does theſe things, is a great man,—but the king, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that they ſhould be done, is a far greater. We muſt do juſtice to our enemies—Theſe are the acts of a patriot king. I am not in dread of the vaſt armies of France: I am not in dread of the gallant
<pb n="lxxxii" facs="tcp:0244800201:86"/>
ſpirit of its brave and numerous nobility: I am not alarmed even at the great navy which has been ſo miraculouſly created. All theſe things Louis the fourteenth had before. With all theſe things, the French monarchy has more than once fallen proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate at the feet of the public faith of Great Britain. It was the want of public credit which diſabled France from recovering after her defeats, or recovering even from her victories and triumphs. It was a prodigal court, it was an ill-ordered revenue, that ſapped the foundations of all her greatneſs. Credit cannot exiſt under the arm of neceſſity. Neceſſity ſtrikes at credit, I allow, with a heavier and quicker blow under an arbitrary monarchy, than under a limited and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced government: but ſtill neceſſity and credit are natural enemies, and cannot be long reconciled in any ſituation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"From neceſſity and corruption, a free ſtate may loſe the ſpirit of that complex conſtitution which is the foundation of confidence. On the other hand, I am far from being ſure, that a monarchy, when once it is properly regulated, may not for a long time, furniſh a foundation for credit upon the ſolidity of its maxims, though it affords no ground of truſt in its inſtitutions. I am afraid I ſee in England, and in France, ſomething like a beginning of both theſe things. I wiſh I may be found in a miſtake."</q>
               </p>
               <p>There are many paſſages in this ſpeech highly worthy the attention of the patriotic ſtateſman, as long as oeconomy is to be conſidered what it has been found—the beſt mine in every nation. Gravity and gaiety, perhaps, were never more happily united in any ſpeech or compoſition. The Revenue Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Knight Probert, (ſee p. 253,) and the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of the Houſhold Troops, (ſee p. 111,) are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimens of the latter, the firſt is written in all the ſpirit of romance, and the ſecond threw the houſe into frequent burſts of laughter, which induced Lord North to whiſper, that ſuch was the verſality of Mr.
<pb n="lxxxiii" facs="tcp:0244800201:87"/>
Burke's powers, that if he were to ſpeak of an old almanack, he could ſet all the planets in the ſame humourous commotion. Having unfolded part of his plan, he called on the houſe to do him juſtice, if it did not tend to aboliſh offices more expenſive than uſeful, to combine duties improperly ſeparated, to change revenues more vexatious than productive, into ready money, to ſuppreſs offices which ſtood in the way of oeconomy, and to cut off lurking ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate treaſurers. Mr. Burke, in a letter to a noble Lord, in 1796, ſpeaks of this meaſure thus: <q rend="inline">"My oeconomical reforms were not the ſuppreſſion of a paltry penſion or employment more or leſs. Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy in my plan was, as it ought to be, ſecondary, ſubordinate, inſtrumental. I acted on ſtate princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. I found a great diſtemper in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and, according to the nature of the evil and the object, I treated it. The malady was deep; it was complicated, in the cauſes and in the ſymptoms. Throughout it was full of contraindicants. On one hand government, daily growing more invidious for an apparent increaſe of the means of ſtrength, was every day growing more contemptible by real weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Nor was this diſſolution confined to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commonly ſo called. It extended to parliament; which was loſing not a little in it's dignity and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, by an opinion of it's not acting on worthy motives.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"A complaint was made of too much influence in the Houſe of Commons, I reduced it in both Houſes; and I gave my reaſons article by article for every reduction, and ſhewed why I thought it ſafe for the ſervice of the ſtate. I heaved the lead every inch of way I made."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The parliament was ſuddenly diſſolved on the firſt of September, 1780. Mr. Burke had now faithfully ſerved his conſtituents ſix years—yet ſtrange as it may appear, when the fame of his integrity and his talents went hand in hand, and was daily increaſing, that
<pb n="lxxxiv" facs="tcp:0244800201:88"/>
his popularity ſhould be on the decline in Briſtol, and it is probable that he would not have offered himſelf a ſecond time to the choice of the electors of that city, if it were not out of reſpect to many worthy characters amongſt the Quakers and Diſſenters in it, who promiſed him their ſupport, and acted up to their promiſe. He accordingly appeared on the huſtings at Guildhall, in Briſtol, with all the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and becoming confidence of a man who was conſcious that he had diſcharged his duty. The meeting was uncommonly numerous on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Three candidates offered themſelves at the ſame time. Mr. Burke, in his turn, addreſſed the audience in a ſpeech replete with arguments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in the moſt eloquent language, in which he defended his parliamentary conduct. <q rend="inline">"If you call upon me,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"I ſhall ſolicit the favour of the city upon manly ground. I come before you with the plain confidence of an honeſt ſervant in the equity of a candid and diſcerning maſter. I come to claim your approbation, not to amuſe you with vain apologies, or with profeſſions ſtill more vain and ſenſeleſs. I have lived too long to be ſerved by apologies, or to ſtand in need of them. The part I have acted has been in open day; and to hold out to a conduct, which ſtands in that clear and ſteady light for all its good and all its evil, to hold out to that conduct, the paltry winking tapers of excuſes and promiſes—I never will do it.—They may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure it with their ſmoke; but they never can illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſunſhine by ſuch a flame as theirs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>One of the charges exhibited againſt him was the part which he took in Lord Beauchamp's bill for reforming the law proceſs for impriſonment for debt (<hi>See Act of Grace, page</hi> 1.) The next was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in the repeal of certain penal laws againſt the Roman Catholics. His defence, on this head, was grounded on the laws of humanity, the ſoundeſt maxims of policy and juſtice, and on theſe points,
<pb n="lxxxv" facs="tcp:0244800201:89"/>
perhaps, no man ever ſhone to ſuch advantage. He wanted to ſnatch the fire-brand out of the hand of the furious zealot, to extinguiſh it for ever, and to ſhew that the weapons of ſuperſtition and ignorance were not to be numbered with the celeſtial arms of religion, and that, notwithſtanding, various paths led to her peaceful abode, yet they all united in the centre like the rays of glory that play round her head</p>
               <p>The part which he took relative to the trade of Ireland gave offence. All commercial maxims are ſelfiſh and narrow. He did not wiſh to ſee the noble tide of Britiſh trade ſlumber on oozy beds, or creep through crooked channels; he wiſhed to ſee it flow as bountifully as the ocean itſelf, ſo that the ſiſter kingdoms might mutually partake of its bleſſings.

                           <p>I decline the election.—It has ever been my rule through life, to obſerve a proportion between my efforts and my objects. I have never been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="lxxxviii" facs="tcp:0244800201:92"/>
for a bold, active, and ſanguine purſuit of advantages that are perſonal to myſelf.</p>
                           <p>I have not canvaſſed the whole of this city in form. But I have taken ſuch a view of it, as ſatisfies my own mind, that your choice will not ultimately fall upon me. Your city, Gentlemen, is in a ſtate of miſerable diſtraction; and I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to withdraw whatever ſhare my pretenſions may have had in its unhappy diviſions. I have not been in haſte; I have tried all prudent means; I have waited for the effect of all contingencies. If I were fond of a conteſt, by the partiality of my numerous friends (whom ye know to be among the moſt weighty and reſpectable people of the city) I have the means of a ſharp one in my hands. But I thought it far better, with my ſtrength unſpent, and my reputation unimpaired, to do, early and from foreſight, that which I might be obliged to do from neceſſity at laſt.</p>
                           <p>I am not in the leaſt ſurpriſed, nor in the leaſt angry, at this view of things. I have read the book of life for a long time, and I have read other books a little. Nothing has happened to me, but what has happened to men much better than me, and in times and in nations full as good as the age and country we live in. To ſay that I am no way concerned would be neither decent nor true. The repreſentation of Briſtol was an object on many accounts dear to me: and I certainly ſhould very far prefer it to any other in the kingdom. My habits are made to it; and it is in general more unpleaſant to be rejected, after long trial, than not to be choſen at all.</p>
                           <p>But, Gentlemen, I will ſee nothing except your former kindneſs, and I will give way to no other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents than thoſe of gratitude. From the bottom of my heart I thank you for what you have done for me. You have given me a long term, which is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. I have performed the conditions, and enjoyed
<pb n="lxxxix" facs="tcp:0244800201:93"/>
all the profits to the full; and I now ſurrender your eſtate into your hands, without being in a ſingle tile, or a ſingle ſtone, impaired or waſted by my uſe. I have ſerved the public for fifteen years. I have ſerved you in particular for ſix. What is paſſed is well ſtored. It is ſafe, and out of the power of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. What is to come, is in wiſer hands than ours; and he, in whoſe hands it is, beſt knows whether it is beſt for you and me, that I ſhould be in parliament, or even in the world.</p>
                           <p>Gentlemen, the melancholy event of yeſterday<note n="*" place="bottom">The death of R. Coombe, Eſq, who intended to offer himſelf a candidate for Briſtol.</note> reads to us an awful leſſon againſt being too much troubled about any of the objects of ordinary ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The worthy gentleman, who has been ſnatched from us at the moment of the election, and in the middle of the conteſt, whilſt his deſires were as warm, and his hopes as eager as ours, has feelingly told us, what ſhadows we are, and what ſhadows we purſue.</p>
                           <p>It has been uſual for a candidate who declines, to take his leave by a letter to the Sheriffs; but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your truſt in the face of day, and in the face of day I accept your diſmiſſion. I am not,—I am not at all aſhamed to look upon you; nor can my preſence diſcompoſe the order of buſineſs here. I humbly and reſpectfully take my leave of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, the Candidates, and the Electors, wiſhing hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily that the choice may be for the beſt, at a time which calls, if ever time did call, for ſervice that is not nominal. It is no plaything you are about. I tremble when I conſider the truſt I have preſumed to aſk. I confided perhaps too much in my intentions. They were really fair and upright; and I am bold to ſay, that I aſk no ill thing for you, when, on parting from this place, I pray, that whoever you chooſe to ſucceed me, may reſemble me exactly in all things,

                           <p>A very large and reſpectable meeting of the principal citizens of Briſtol did, by an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vote, authorize me to offer myſelf once more to your ſervice. My deference to that authority was the ſole motive for giving you one moment's trouble. On my canvaſs, ſo far as it has proceeded, I have found that my pretenſions were well received, and even with a degree of warmth in many of the electors.</p>
                           <p>But on a calm and very deliberate view of the ſtate of the city, I am convinced that no other conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can be reaſonably expected from my conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing a candidate, than a long, vexatious, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive conteſt. Conſcious, that no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my ſervice, and that of any other man, can be worth the inconveniencies of ſuch a ſtruggle. I decline the election.</p>
                           <p>I return you my beſt thanks for having, at any time, or for any period, condeſcended to think of me for your repreſentative. I have done my duty towards you, and towards the nation, as became me. You diſpoſe of the future truſt (as you have a right to do) according to your diſcretion. We have no cauſe of complaint on either ſide. By being returned into the maſs of private citizens, my burthens are leſſened, my ſatisfactions are not deſtroyed.

                  <q rend="inline">"Obſcurity and retirement"</q> are favourite expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on the lips of every great man, but if Mr. Burke thought that he was ſufficiently prepared to throw himſelf into the arms of one or the other, he ſeems to have been little acquainted with his own heart. Moſt of thoſe whom he wiſhed to pleaſe were ſtill alive, the circle of his friends was hourly expanding, and it would have exhibited rather a kind of peeviſhneſs and ill humour, to throw down his ſword and buckler, becauſe he had loſt one engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when others of more importance remained to be contended in. His friends exerted every nerve in ſupport of his cauſe, or rather their own, and were determined to diſpute every inch of ground to the laſt, but he did not wiſh to put them to that trouble—he declined—and retired amidſt the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits of even thoſe who had not voted for him, and though he loſt the election, it may be fairly ſaid that he gained the victory.</p>
               <p>Having made his election for Malton, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to attack Miniſters ſometimes with a groſſneſs of language, which many of his friends reprobated, and which Lord North uſed to call the lava of Mr. Burke's eloquence.</p>
               <p>Much about this time the neceſſity of a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary reform was contended for, as eſſential to the ſalvation of the conſtitution. A committee was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in Yorkſhire, in order to take this important ſubject into conſideration; a ſimilar committee was about to be appointed for the ſame purpoſe in Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghamſhire.
<pb n="xcii" facs="tcp:0244800201:96"/>
Mr. Burke addreſſed a letter to a gentleman of that county, in which he gave his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on this weighty matter, the following extracts are taken from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The country will, in ſome way or other, be called upon to declare it your opinion, that the Houſe of Commons is not ſufficiently numerous, and that the elections are not ſufficiently frequent. That an hundred new knights of the ſhire ought to be added; and that we are to have a new election, once in three years for certain, and as much oftener as the King pleaſes. Such will be the ſtate of things, if the propoſitions made ſhall take effect.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"All this may be proper; but as an honeſt man, I cannot poſſibly give my vote for it, until I have conſidered it more fully. I will not deny, that our conſtitution may have faults, and that thoſe faults, when found, ought to be corrected. It is not every thing which appears at firſt view to be faulty, in ſuch a very complicated plan as our conſtitution. To enable us to correct the conſtitution, the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution muſt be viewed together, and it muſt be compared with the actual conſtitution of the people, and the circumſtances of the time. For that, which taken ſingly, and by itſelf may appear to be wrong, when conſidered with relation to other things may be perfectly right, or at leaſt ſuch as ought to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endured, as the means of preventing ſomething that is much worſe. So far with regard to what, at firſt view, may appear a <hi>diſtemper</hi> in the conſtitution. As to the <hi>remedy</hi> of that diſtemper, an equal caution ought to be uſed; becauſe this latter conſideration is not ſingle and ſeparate, no more than the former. There are many things in reformation, which would be proper to be done, if other things can be done along with them, but which, if they cannot be ſo accompanied, ought not to be done at all. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſh, when any deep matter of this new nature

is propoſed to me, to have the whole ſcheme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly in my view, and full time to conſider of it. Pleaſe God, I will walk with caution, whenever I am not able to ſee my way clearly before me."</q>

I have been for fifteen years a very laborious Member of Parliament, and in that time have had great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſeeing with my own eyes the working of the machine of our government; of remarking where it went ſmoothly, and did its buſineſs, and where it checked in its movements, or where it da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged its work. I have alſo had, and uſed the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of converſing with men of the greateſt wiſdom, and fulleſt experience in theſe matters; and I do declare to you moſt ſolemnly and moſt truly, that on the reſult of all this reading, thinking, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and communication, I am not able to come to an immediate reſolution in ſavour of a change in the ground-work of our conſtitution; and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that in the preſent ſtate of the country, in the preſent ſtate of our repreſentation, in the preſent ſtate of our modes and rights of electing, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of the ſeveral prevalent intereſts, in the preſent ſtate of the affairs and manners of this country, I am not able to vote that the addition of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred knights of the ſhire, and the hurrying of election on election, will be things advantageous, either to liberty or to good government.</q>

It would be dreadful, indeed, if there were any power in the nation capable of reſiſting its unanimous deſire, or even the deſire of any great or very decided majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the people. The people may be deceived in
<pb n="xciv" facs="tcp:0244800201:98"/>
their choice of an object, but I can ſcarcely conceive that any choice they can make to be ſo very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, as the exiſtence of any human force capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of reſiſting it. It will certainly be the duty of every man, in the ſituation to which God has called him, to give his beſt opinion and advice upon the matter; it will <hi>not</hi> be his duty (let him think what he will) to uſe any violent or fraudulent means of counteracting the general wiſh, or even of employing the <hi>legal and conſtructive</hi> organ of expreſſing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's ſenſe againſt the ſenſe which they ſo <hi>actually</hi> entertained."</q>

               <p>Towards the concluſion of the year 1781, Mr. Burke, and ſeveral characters in the nation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminently diſtinguiſhed by their rank and patriotiſm, their riches and their influence, were applied to from a quarter where the ſources of a ſecret and important intelligence were as indubitable as the readineſs to communicate. It was fervent and unſullied, a variety of delicate circumſtances (of which not the leaſt cogent is the preſent exiſtence of ſeveral of the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious parties concerned) forbids us to expatiate on the ſubject, whilſt we lament that we are compelled to allude to it in an exceedingly abridged ſtatement. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations had been made, which, had they been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up with unanimous energy and perſeverance, would, in all probability, have prevented the diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berment of America from Great Britain. What were the anſwers of other individuals to an awful and preſſing requiſition muſt be paſſed over. We can almoſt verbally affirm, that the delivered opinion of Mr. Burke was, <q rend="inline">"that he did not entertain the leaſt doubt of the truth of the information, but that all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in conſequence of it would prove fruitleſs, becauſe the adminiſtration explicitly manifeſted a rivetted determination to purſue the ſame meaſures until they ſhould become quite annihilated by their poſitive inability to continue the war againſt the colonies."</q>

                  <pb n="xcv" facs="tcp:0244800201:99"/>On the 28th of March, 1782, Lord North aſſured the Houſe, on <hi>authority,</hi> that the <hi>preſent adminiſtration was no more!</hi> and that for the purpoſe of giving the neceſſary time for new arrangements, he moved an adjournment, which was inſtantly agreed to. The arrangements were as follow: The Marquis of Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham Firſt Lord of the Treaſury, the Earl of Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne and Mr. Fox joint Secretaries of State, Lord Camden Preſident of the Council, Duke of Grafton Privy Seal, Lord John Cavendiſh Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Burke Paymaſter-General of the Forces.</p>
               <p>A few days after Mr. Burke was made a Privy Counſellor.</p>
               <p>The dawn of the new adminiſtration promiſed a refulgent day. The leading members of it had pledged themſelves to many regulations and reforms, which they began to carry into execution as ſoon as the parliament met, with a degree of alacrity and liberality unknown in the parliamentary hiſtory of this country. The integrity and judgment of the Marquis of Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham juſtly exalted him in the opinion of the nation, but at the very inſtant that his bleeding country leaned on his honeſt heart, it pleaſed the King of Kings to call him to himſelf. This illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious patriot expired on the firſt of July, 1782, of a complaint with which he had been long afflicted—(the hydrothorax) and which had latterly very much encreaſed, from his unremitting attention to public buſineſs. His loſs was felt and deplored by the whole nation. Mr. Burke drew his character when living, (<hi>See page</hi> 484) and little did he think, perhaps, at the time, that he ſhould be ſo ſoon called on to pay the laſt ſad tribute to his memory, which he did in the following inſcription, for the mauſoleum erected in Wentworth Park, and in which Earl Fitzwilliam has alſo placed a buſt of the writer of it.</p>

                           <p>A ſtateſman, in whom conſtancy, fidelity, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and directneſs, were the ſole inſtruments of his policy. His virtues were his arts.</p>
                           <p>A clear, ſound, unadulterated ſenſe, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with intricate deſign, or diſturbed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed paſſion, gave conſiſtency, dignity and effect to all his meaſures. In oppoſition, he reſpected the principles of government; in adminiſtration he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the liberties of the people. He employed his moments of power in realizing every thing which he had propoſed in a popular ſituation. This was the diſtinguiſhing mark of his conduct. After twenty-four years of ſervice to the public, in a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and trying time, he left no debt of juſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unſatisfied.</p>
                           <p>By his prudence and patience, he brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a party, which it was the great object of his labours to render permanent, not as an inſtrument of ambition, but as a living depoſitory of principle.</p>
                           <p>The virtues of his public and private life were not, in him, of different characters. It was the ſame feeling, benevolent, liberal mind, which, in the internal relations of life, conciliated the unfeigned love of thoſe who ſee men as they are, which made him an inflexible patriot. He was devoted to the cauſe of liberty, not becauſe he was haughty and untractable, but becauſe he was beneficent and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>
                           <p>Let his ſucceſſors, who from this houſe behold this monument, reflect that their conduct will make it their glory or their reproach; let them be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that ſimilarity of manners, not proximity of blood, gives them an intereſt in this ſtatue.</p>

               <p>By this change Mr. Burke fell once more into the ranks of oppoſition, and continued ſo till after the peace of 1783. We have now followed Mr. Burke to this period, and it was eaſy and pleaſant to follow him, as the road was direct, and he was always found in the middle of it, and though there were alluring proſpects on either ſide, he was never known to be drawn aſide from the rugged path of virtue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
               <p>He had travelled this road many years, and was never known to faint or lag in the dreary journey, with many companions, it is true; rich in worth, rich in wealth, but Mr. Burke was only rich in fame, and he had a ſon, the centre of his affections. Mr. Burke, at that period, ſhone to the higheſt advantage in every point of view; even the <hi>ſhades</hi> of his character ſerved to embody the <hi>lights</hi>—<q rend="inline">"He cenſures God who quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with the imperfections of man."</q> He had loſt his leading ſtar in his patron, and thus, for a moment bewildered, he fell into the <hi>coalition,</hi> ſo often repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by members of a more extraordinary one. The reſult of this junction of parties was, that the Duke of Portland was placed at the head of the Treaſury, Lord John Cavendiſh reſumed his office as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord North and Mr. Fox were appointed Secretaries of State, Mr.

Sheridan Secretary to the Treaſury, and Mr. Burke Paymaſter-General of the Forces.</p>
               <p>On the 18th of November, 1783, Mr. Fox moved for leave to bring in his Eaſt-India Bill; leave was given, and on the firſt of December following, when the queſtion was put, that the Speaker <q rend="inline">"do now leave the chair,"</q> after ſome oppoſition to it, Mr. Burke roſe, and defended the principles of the bill in a ſpeech, in which it may almoſt be ſaid, that he ſurpaſſed himſelf in brilliancy of language and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of argument; it would not fall ſhort of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with India itſelf—ſuch dominion of mind, ſuch graſp of thought—ſuch powers of deſcription—and ſo intimate a knowledge of the ſubject, that every ſcene ſeemed to be the effect of magic inſtead of oratory. The peroration is the fineſt in any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, for it was the character of his friend Mr. Fox (<hi>See page</hi> 461)—
<q>
                     <l>Warm from the ſoul, and faithful to its fires.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In the diſcuſſion of this bill, Mr. Burke noticed particularly a phraſe that had frequently been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed (by Mr. W. Pitt) with a view of exciting odium againſt the bill and its promoters, viz. <q rend="inline">"the chartered rights of men."</q> The phraſe, he obſerved, was full of affectation and ambiguity. The rights of men, that is, the natural rights of mankind, he ſaid, were ſacred things, and if any public meaſure was ſound miſchievouſly to affect them, that circumſtance ought to be an objection fatal to the meaſure, but that was not the caſe here; the rights the India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's charters communicated (to ſpeak of them in terms of the greateſt poſſible moderation) did, at leaſt, ſuſpend the natural rights of mankind, and were liable to fall into a direct violation of them, and it was the abſolute duty of parliament, he added, to guard againſt ſuch violation. A new arrangement of miniſters took place in 1783, when Mr. W. Pitt was appointed Firſt Lord of the Treaſury.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xcix" facs="tcp:0244800201:103"/>The next ſubject of importance that occupied the parliamentary attention of Mr. Burke was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of Mr. Haſtings. On the 17th of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, 1785, Mr. Burke opened the accuſation. <q rend="inline">"I am told,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"that the ſtep I am now about to take, is not likely to be a pleaſing one to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and that the good people of England wiſh that their old and popular member would decline it, but there is a ſentence in the beſt book which tingles in my ear—Happy are ye when men ſhall revile you, and ſpeak lightly of you for my ſake."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſpeech was very long, but he had the happy art of rendering it intereſting. <q rend="inline">"Had Mr. Haſtings,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"taught the pyramid to ſeek the ſky, had he conducted the plough into the deſolate boſom of the valley, reined the proud arch over the foaming flood, ſent the ſluggard to the ant, the politician to the bee, and the plunderer to priſon, I ſhould be readier to applaud him than I am to accuſe him, but inſtead of that, he baniſhed ſcience from her natal ſeat, the native princes were packed up in priſons like bales of muſlin, and left to feed on the vapours of a gaol, even deprived of opium to lull their ſenſes into forgetfulneſs; the plough was arreſted in its ſhining career, and wherever he trod he marked his footſteps in blood and devaſtation."</q> After this he proceeded to a deſcription of the province of Oude, the paradiſe of the ancients, and having depicted the beauty and natural fertility of that country in all the glow of a youthful poet; he adverted to the unhappy ſtate of the Zemindars, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Mr. Haſtings to the Rohillas. Thoſe who heard this ſpeech imagined that little more could be ſaid on the ſubject, but what was their ſurprize when Mr. Sheridan delivered his celebrated oration on ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up the Begum charge, on Friday, June 6, 1788, which abounded with ſo many beauties, that to point out one in preference to the other, would be to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſingle out a ſtar in the milky way? Ambitious,
<pb n="c" facs="tcp:0244800201:104"/>
however, that ſome portion of it ſhould adorn our humble page, we inſert the following, where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the calamities brought on the province of Oude by the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Had a ſtranger, at this time (in 1782) gone into the kingdom of Oude, ignorant of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſince the death of Sujah Dowla, that man, who, with a ſavage heart had ſtill great lines of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and who, with all his ferocity in war, had ſtill, with a cultivating hand, preſerved to his country the riches which it derived from benignant ſkies and a prolific ſoil. If this ſtranger, ignorant of all that had happened in the ſhort interval, and obſerving the wide and general devaſtation, and all horrors of the ſcene—of plains uncloathed and brown—of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion burnt up and extinguiſhed—of villages depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated and in ruin—of temples unroofed and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—of reſervoirs broken down and dry—he would naturally enquire what war has thus laid waſte the fertile fields of this once beautiful and opulent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try—what civil diſſentions have happened thus to tear aſunder, and ſeparate the happy ſocieties that once poſſeſſed thoſe villages—what diſputed ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—what religious rage has, with unholy violence, demoliſhed thoſe temples, and diſturbed fervent, but unobtruding piety, in the exerciſes of its duties?—What mercileſs enemy has thus ſpread the horrors of fire and ſword—what ſevere viſitation of Providence has thus dried up the fountain, and taken from the face of the earth every veſtige of verdure? Or rather, what monſters have ſtalked over the country, taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and poiſoning, with peſtiferous breath, what the voracious appetite could not devour? To ſuch queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what muſt be the anſwer? No wars have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaged theſe lands and depopulated theſe villages—no civil diſcords have been felt—no diſputed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion—no religious rage—no mercileſs enemy—no affliction of Providence, which, while it ſcourged for the moment, cut off the ſources of reſuſcitation
<pb n="ci" facs="tcp:0244800201:105"/>
—no voracious and poiſoning monſters—no, all this has been accompliſhed by the <hi>friendſhip, generoſity,</hi> and <hi>kindneſs</hi> of the Engliſh nation. They have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced us with their protecting arms, and, lo! thoſe are the fruits of their alliance. What, then, ſhall we be told, that under ſuch circumſtances, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated feelings of a whole people, thus goaded and ſpurred on to clamour and reſiſtance, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the poor and ſeeble influence of the Begums! When we hear from Captain Naylor the deſcription that he gives of the paroxiſm, fever and delirium, into which deſpair had thrown the natives, when on the banks of the polluted Ganges, panting for death, they tore more widely open the lips of their gaping wounds, to accelerate their diſſolution, and while their blood was iſſuing preſented their ghaſtly eyes to Heaven, breathing their laſt and fervent prayer that the dry earth might not be ſuffered to drink their blood, but that it might riſe up to the throne of God, and rouſe the eternal Providence to avenge the wrongs of their country. Will it be ſaid that this was brought about by the incantations of theſe Begums in their ſecluded Zenana? or that they could inſpire this enthuſiaſm and this deſpair into the breaſts of a people who felt no grievance, and had ſuffered no torture? What motive, then, could have ſuch influence in their boſom? What motive! That which Nature, the common parent, plants in the boſom of man, and which, though it may be leſs active in the Indian than in the Engliſhman, is ſtill congenial with and makes a part of his being—that feeling which tells him, that man was never made to be the property of man; but that when through pride and inſolence of power, one human creature dares to tyrannize over another, it is a power uſurped, and reſiſtance is a duty—that feeling which tells him that all power is delegated for the good, not for the injury of the people, and that when it is converted from the original purpoſe, the compact is broken,
<pb n="cii" facs="tcp:0244800201:106"/>
and the right is to be reſumed—that principle which tells him that reſiſtance to power uſurped is not merely a duty which he owes to himſelf and to his neighbour, but a duty which he owes to his God, in aſſerting and maintaining the rank which he gave him in his creation!—to that common God, who, where he gives the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> whatever may be the complexion, gives alſo the <hi>feelings</hi> and the <hi>rights</hi> of <hi>man</hi>—that principle, which neither the rudeneſs of ignorance can ſtifle, nor the enervation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement extinguiſh!—that principle which makes it baſe for a man to ſuffer when he ought to act, which, tending to preſerve to the ſpecies the original deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Providence, ſpurns at the arrogant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of man, and vindicates the independent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his race."</q> He ſaid, that it had been a practice with Mr. Haſtings to hold himſelf out as a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural being, gifted with good fortune, or elſe the peculiar favourite of Heaven, and that Providence never failed to take up and carry, by wife but hidden means, every project of his to its deſtined end. In this blaſphemous way did the priſoner at the bar libel the courſe of Providence. Thus, according to him, when his corruptions and bribers were on the eve of expoſure, Providence inſpired the heart of Nunducomar to commit a low, baſe crime, in order to ſave Mr. Haſtings from ruin. Thus, alſo, when in his attempts on Cheyt Sing, and his plunder of the Begums, Providence ſtepped in, and inſpired the one with reſiſtance, and the other with rebellion, to forward his purpoſes. Thus did he arrogantly hold himſelf forth as a man, not only the favourite of Providence, but as one for whoſe ſake Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence departed from the eternal cauſe of its own wiſe diſpenſations. Thus did he preſume to ſay that he was honoured and aſſiſted in the adminiſtration of office by inſpiring felonies, heaven-born crimes, and providential treaſons! Arraigning that Providence, whoſe works are goodneſs, and whoſe ways are right.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="ciii" facs="tcp:0244800201:107"/>Mr. Burke's panegyric on this ſpeech ought not to be omitted; it ran nearly as follows:—</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"He has, this day, ſurprized the thouſands who hung with rapture on his accents, by ſuch an array of talents, ſuch an exhibition of capacity, ſuch a diſplay of powers, as are unparalleled in the annals of oratory; a diſplay that reflected the higheſt honor upon himſelf—luſtre upon letters—renown upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament—glory upon the country. Of all ſpecies of rhetoric, of every kind of eloquence that has been witneſſed or recorded, either in ancient or modern times; whatever the acuteneſs of the bar, the dignity of the ſenate, the ſolidity of the judgment-ſeat, and the ſacred morality of the pulpits, have hitherto fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; nothing have equalled what we have this day heard in Weſtminſter-hall. No holy ſeer of religion, no ſtateſman, no orator, no man of any literary deſcription whatever, has come up, in the one inſtance, to the pure ſentiments of morality, or, in the other, to that variety of knowledge, force of imagination, propriety and vivacity of alluſion, beauty and elegance of diction, ſtrength and copiouſneſs of ſtile, pathos and ſublimity of conception, to which we, this day, liſtened with ardour and admiration. From poetry up to eloquence, there is not a ſpecies of compoſition of which a complete and perfect ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen might not, from that ſingle ſpeech, be called and collected."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who had never read Mr. Burke's ſpeeches, or heard him ſpeak before, might be eaſily induced to ſuppoſe that he had reſerved all the ſtores of his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for the impeachment of Mr. Haſtings, ſo that the beauties of thoſe ſpeeches were as countleſs as the beauties of the fair that aſſembled to liſten to them. In the courſe of one of them he ſtiled Mr. Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <q rend="inline">"The Commander and Captain General of the Enormities in India."</q> When he conferred this title on him, he took care that it ſhould not be a mere empty one; he ſoon furniſhed him with abundance
<pb n="civ" facs="tcp:0244800201:108"/>
of troops, agents, &amp;c. which he marſhalled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picted in the moſt artful and eloquent manner. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn the character of Congo Bulwant Sing (a ſecretary employed by Mr. Haſtings) in the blackeſt colours, he came to that of Debi Sing, which he painted as one of the greateſt villains that ever ſtained the page of hiſtory. <q rend="inline">"This monſter,"</q> or rather this collection of monſters, according to Mr. Burke, <q rend="inline">"raiſed the rents of the inhabitants. He crouded the priſons with perſons of all ranks, and made them give bonds to what amount he pleaſed, as the price of their liberty; theſe bonds were put in force, and their demeſnes ſold at one year's purchaſe, to cancel the unjuſt debt. This was not ſufficient; he ſold even the very ground deſtined for the burial of the owners, and this was to them, from the nature of their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and religion, the moſt heart-rending of all their loſſes. Having robbed the living of their liberty, food, &amp;c. and the dead even of a reſting place, he recollected there was another claſs, the poor peaſantry, who, though unable to aſſiſt in the gratification of his avarice, they could ſtill, however, adminiſter to his cruelty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"This inoffenſive race was cruelly tortured; cords were drawn tight round the fingers, until the fleſh of the four on each hand was actually incorporated and become one ſolid maſs; the fingers were then ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by wedges of iron, and wood driven in between them. Others were tied two and two by the feet, and thrown acroſs a wooden bar, upon which they hung with their feet uppermoſt; they were then beat on the ſoals of their feet until their toe-nails dropped off.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"They were afterwards beat about the head until the blood guſhed out at the mouth, noſe, and ears; they were alſo flogged upon the naked body with bamboo canes and prickly buſhes, and, above all, with ſome poiſonous weeds, which were of a moſt cauſtic nature, and burnt at every touch. The cruelty of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="cv" facs="tcp:0244800201:109"/>
who had ordered all this, had contrived to tear the mind as well as body; he frequently had a father and a ſon tied naked to one another by the feet and arms, and then flogged until the ſkin was torn from the fleſh; and he had the deviliſh ſatisfaction to know that every blow muſt hurt, for if one eſcaped the ſon, his ſenſibility was wounded by the knowledge he had that the blow had fallen upon his father; when the ſame torture was felt by the father, then he knew that every blow that miſſed him had fallen upon his ſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The treatment of the females could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; dragged forth from the inmoſt receſſes of their houſes, which the religion of the country had made for many ſanctuaries, they were expoſed naked to the public view; the virgins were carried to the court of juſtice, where they might naturally have looked for protection; but now they looked for it in vain, for in the face of the miniſters of juſtice, in the face of the ſpectators, in the face of the ſun, thoſe tender and modeſt virgins were brutally violated.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The only difference between their treatment and that of the mothers was, that the former were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured in the face of day, the latter in the gloomy receſſes of their dungeons. Other females had the nipples of their breaſts put in a clift of bamboo, and torn off: What modeſty in all nations moſt carefully conceals, this monſter revealed to view, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by ſlow fires, nay, ſome of the monſtrous tools of this monſter Debi Sing had, horrid to tell, carried their unnatural brutality ſo far as to introduce death into the ſource of life."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here Mr. Burke dropt his head upon his hands, unable to proceed, ſo greatly was he oppreſſed by the horror which he felt at this relation. The effect of it was viſible through the whole auditory; the late Mrs. Sheridan fainted away, ſeveral ladies ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the agitation of their feelings, amongſt others Mrs. Siddons. Such a tragedy was never exhibited
<pb n="cvi" facs="tcp:0244800201:110"/>
on any ſtage, or delivered in ſuch impaſſionate tones; and when his tongue could no longer perform its office, indignation and pity alternately ſpoke from his brow.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding Mr. Burke could command all the figures of rhetoric, all the flowers of fancy, all the beauties of poetry, all the fruits of experience, all the axioms, maxims, authorities, and quotations of ancient and modern writers, yet he could not command his temper, nor could he mention Mr. Haſting's name without adding ſome degrading epithet, which he well knew he ought not to do, out of reſpect to the Court, and even to himſelf. This involved him ſometimes in dilemmas which he might have eaſily avoided, if he had followed the gentleman-like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Mr. Fox, and the reſt of the managers. On one of theſe occaſions he was rebuked by a right reverend prelate. On the 13th of June, 1793, Mr. Francis de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Burke thanked Mr. Francis, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He never did, nor would, put his truſt in great men, nor in little men, but in him that commanded him neither to truſt in the one nor the other."</q> Mr. Fox, on the opening of the Benares charge, having occaſion to mention Mr. Burke, could not be ſatisfied with the bare mention of a name that was ſo dear to him.</p>

                  <pb n="cvii" facs="tcp:0244800201:111"/>We ſhall not pretend to ſay what was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which induced Mr. Burke to become the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic accuſer of Mr. Haſtings; but his perſeverance in the purſuit undoubtedly tended to encreaſe his fame, which was then on the decline, and if he had abſtained from all aſperity of language to the accuſed, he would have ſtood in a ſtill fairer point of view with the public; perhaps no man ever exhibited, even in his very countenance, tone, and geſture, a higher degree of perſonal triumph than he did the day after he found himſelf in the majority on the queſtion of impeachment. Having met one of his friends, he could ſcarce contain himſelf with rapture, <q rend="inline">"This is a proud day for England,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"what a glorious proſpect! her juſtice extending to Aſia, her humanity to Africa, her friendſhip to America, and her faith and good will to all Europe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reſult of the impeachment is ſo well known, and the whole of the proceedings ſo amply detailed in various publications, that it is unneceſſary to dwell any longer on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>In the debate on the commercial treaty with France, on the 23d of January, 1787, Mr. Burke oppoſed it with his uſual eloquence and violence. Mr. Pitt, he ſaid, with that narrowneſs which leads men of limitted minds to look at great objects in a confined point of view, ſpoke of the tranſaction as if it was the affair of two little 'compting-houſes, and not of two great nations. He ſeemed to conſider it as a contention between the ſign of the Fleur-de-lis and the ſign of the old Red Lion, which ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the beſt cuſtom.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The love,"</q> ſaid he <q rend="inline">"that <hi>France</hi> bears to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has been depicted in all the glowing rant of romance. Nay, in order to win upon our paſſions at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of our reaſon, ſhe has been perſonified—decked out in all her <hi>Lilies</hi>—and endued with a heart inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of infidelity, and a tongue that ſeems only at a loſs to convey the artleſs language of that heart.

               </p>
               <p>The two houſes met on the 27th of November, 1787. It was ſtated in the ſpeech that the King of Pruſſia had taken meaſures to enforce his demand of ſatisfaction for the inſult offered to the Princeſs of Orange.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke took occaſion to mention the King's ſpeech, which he ſpoke of with great humour and pleaſantry; he ſaid, it was uſual to hold it out as a morſel of finiſhed eloquence, and as a proof of the miniſter's powers of compoſition. The ſpeech was certainly an extraordinary performance, but if any man was to make it, and the facts it contained the grounds of hiſtorical narrative, he would certainly riſque a good deal of ridicule. Inſtead of grave hiſtory, it partook more of the nature of an epic poem, rather reſembling an agreeable allegory, or a romance in the ſtyle of ancient chivalry. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded him pretty ſtrongly of Palmeron of England, Don Bellianis of Greece, and other books of that romantic nature, which he formerly had loſt much of his time in reading. He was glad to find, however, that the gallantry of thoſe kings and princes, that had ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed themſelves when chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry prevailed, was revived. Let any gentleman examine the vein in which the ſpeech proceeded, and he would inſtantly perceive the ſtrong reſemblance it bore to the ſubjects of ancient romance. A chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrous king hearing that a princeſs had been affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="cix" facs="tcp:0244800201:113"/>
takes his lance, aſſembles his knights, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines to do her juſtice. He ſets out inſtantly with his knights in queſt of adventures, and carries all before him, atchieving wonders in the cauſe of the injured princeſs. This reminded him of the ancient ſtory of a princeſs named Latona, who, having been inſulted by a nation, like the Dutch, appealed to Jupiter for ſatisfaction, when the God, in revenge for her wrongs, turned the nation that had affronted her into a nation of frogs, and left them to live among dykes and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. [<hi>The Houſe burſt into a roar of laughter at the apt introduction of this old fable.</hi>] Mr. Burke purſued his pleaſantry with laughable comments on the ſpeech, and among others he remarked, that although the King of Pruſſia had profeſſedly ſet out merely to obtain adequate ſatisfaction for the injury done his ſiſter; his army, by accident, took Utrecht, poſſeſſed themſelves of Amſterdam, reſtored the Stadtholder and the former government, and all this at a ſtroke, and, <hi>by the bye,</hi> which put him in mind of a verſe in a ſprightly ſong of Cowley's (his ballad, entitled the Chronicle) that he often had read with pleaſure,
<q>
                     <l>But when Iſabella came</l>
                     <l>Arm'd with reſiſtleſs flame</l>
                     <l>And th' artillery of her eye,</l>
                     <l>While ſhe proudly marched about,</l>
                     <l>Greater conqueſts to find out,</l>
                     <l>She beat out Suſan, <hi>by the bye.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Though Mr. Burke affected to deſpiſe popularity, yet no man, perhaps, was ever more ſuſceptible of flattery, which he always paid in kind, but a ſtroke of wit, or a ſingle paragraph in a newſpaper, were ſufficient to diſcompoſe his temper, particularly when he was ſinking into the vale of life. A few years ſince, he happened to call on an old friend, who was very fond of collecting prints of Britiſh patriots. Mr. Burke was not a little pleaſed to ſee one of himſelf in that liſt, with the following rude, but pointed lines written under it with a pencil, which he did not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately perceive;
<q>
                     <pb n="cx" facs="tcp:0244800201:114"/>
                     <l>Pelliculam veterem retinet, ac fronte polite</l>
                     <l>Astutam vapido ſervat ſub pectore vulpem.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The old gentleman ſaw, by Mr. Burke's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that it diſpleaſed him, but proteſted he was wholly ignorant of the writer, and that, as he did not underſtand Latin, he thought the lines were filled with his praiſe, and immediately effaced them, but they had ſunk too deep in Mr. Burke's memory to be effaced; he took a haſty leave, and never after entered the houſe. In the parliamentary receſs of 1788, he went to Ireland, accompanied by his ſon. His arrival in that country was announced in a provincial newſpaper in the following words: <q rend="inline">"Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an abſence of many years, the celebrated Iriſh orator and Britiſh member of parliament, Edmund Burke, has arrived in his native country. It is not flattery to ſay, that he is the boaſt of the Engliſh ſenate, and the glory of the Iriſh nation."</q> One of the firſt poets in that kingdom wrote ſome encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic verſes on the occaſion, which Mr. Burke repaid in proſe, equal in point of fancy and imagination to the tuneful effuſion. It was deemed a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary that the univerſity of Dublin did not then preſent him with the honorary degree of doctor of laws, but he was never heard to acknowledge that he was highly indebted to the education which he received in that ſeminary. Having ſpent ſome months in the ſouth of Ireland, he returned to England. The Reverend Doctor Campbell<note n="*" place="bottom">Author of the Hiſtory of Ireland.</note> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to ſail in the packet with him; <q rend="inline">"I don't know any thing,"</q> ſaid the Doctor to a friend one day, <q rend="inline">"that gave me ſo much pleaſure as to find that I was to croſs the Iriſh Helleſpont in the company of a man of whom I had heard ſo much. I was extremely ſorry that I had not the honour of being known to any one of the paſſengers who could
<pb n="cxi" facs="tcp:0244800201:115"/>
introduce me to him, but it was not difficult to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Mr. Burke to converſation. We were in ſight of the hill of Howth juſt as the ſun began to ſpread his beams. Mr. Burke enjoyed the beauties of the ſcenery, even the light clouds, which enveloped the top of the hill, did not eſcape his attention; <q rend="inline">"I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſaid he, that ſome of the Dublin milliners do not form a head-dreſs in imitation of thoſe many coloured clouds, and call it the Howth-cap."</q> His converſation was rich and captivating; he told me he had paſſed ſome days at Lord Kenmere's country ſeat, near the lakes of Killarney—that delightful ſpot, which taſte ſeems to have ſelected from all that is beautiful in the volume of nature. But his deſcription of it exceeded any thing I had ever read or heard before, particularly when he touched on the flowery race; good heaven! how he cloathed the lilly in new-born light, and the roſe in virgin bluſhes; in ſhort, it may be ſaid, that he almoſt coloured round. Speaking of Lord Charlemont, he praiſed the gentleneſs of his manners, and the mildneſs of his temper, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by comparing him to an old picture, whoſe tints were mellowed by time. When I talked of the ſtate of learning in Ireland, he ſhook his head, folded his arms, and remained ſilent for a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. In his perſon he is about five feet eight inches, remarkably ſtraight for his years, but his mind is more erect than his body. There is a good deal of placidity in his countenance, but nothing of dignity, and, from his noſe, I think that no man can ſneer with more eaſe and effect if he chuſes."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A gentleman, (Mr. T—) favoured me ſome time ſince with the following minutes of a converſation with Mr. Burke:—</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"December the ſixth I happened to be in Mr. Townley's ſtudy; about eleven o'clock Mr. Burke and the Reverend Doctor King came in to view Mr. Townley's fine collection of ſtatues. Mr. Burke ſeemed highly pleaſed with the whole, particularly
<pb n="cxii" facs="tcp:0244800201:116"/>
that of the Baian Homer. Having paid many juſt compliments to the taſte of the collector, he entered into converſation with me in ſo eaſy and friendly a manner, that if I was charmed a few minutes before with the taſte and judicious reflection of the ſcholar, I was not leſs delighted with the man. I ſhewed him an old manuſcript copy of Homer (written, I believe, in the tenth century) he read a few paſſages in it with the greateſt fluency, and criticiſed ſome of the critics who had written on the father of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal verſe. He invited me to breakfaſt with him the next morning, without ſo much as knowing my name. I promiſed to do myſelf that honour. My name is Edmund Burke, ſaid he, juſt as he was going out of the door, I live in Gerard-ſtreet, Soho. I called the next morning about nine; it was exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively cold; I was ſhewn into the drawing-room, and in a few minutes Mr. Burke entered, and ſhook me by the hand in the moſt friendly manner.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B. <q rend="inline">"Have you been long out of Ireland, Sir?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>T. <q rend="inline">"Some years."</q>

               <p>Mr. B. <q rend="inline">"I paid that country a viſit laſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for the purpoſe of ſeeing a ſiſter, a widow (Mrs. French, I believe) I had not ſeen it for twenty years before."</q>
               </p>
               <p>T. <q rend="inline">"It's very much changed within the laſt twenty years."</q>

               <p>Mr. B. <q rend="inline">"Very much for the better."</q>

               <p>T. <q rend="inline">"A ſpirit of induſtry has pervaded almoſt every quarter of the kingdom; the morals of the people are improved, the country gentlemen, in many parts, have relinquiſhed the favourite amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the chace for the plough."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B. <q rend="inline">"Not as much as I could wiſh, but ſtill more than I expected. As to agriculture, it may be called the eighth ſcience. <q rend="inline">"We may talk what we pleaſe,"</q> ſays Cowley, of <q rend="inline">"lillies and lions rampant, and ſpread eagles in fields d'or or d'argent, but if

               <p>T. <q rend="inline">Very true, Sir, but it is ſaid that the phyſical ſituation of Ireland is not favourable to the progreſs of tillage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B. <q rend="inline">I have often heard ſo, but experience proves the contrary. I ſaw, and I ſaw it with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in my little tour through ſome parts of the ſouth of Ireland, two or three mountains cloathed with luxuriant graſs, that in my time was ſcarcely covered with barren heath, and half-ſtarved briars, Breakfaſt was now brought in, young Mr. Burke and Dr. King were preſent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>T. <q rend="inline">There are many paſſages in the ancient laws of Ireland that evince that agriculture flouriſhed at a very early period in that country.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B. <q rend="inline">Do you mean in the Brehon laws? I wiſh they were tranſlated.</q>
               </p>
               <p>T. <q rend="inline">I wiſh ſo too; I am ſure the univerſity of Dublin is very much obliged to you, Sir, for the fragments which you preſented of the ſea-bright collection; they are valuable, as they contain many particulars that ſhed light on the manners and cuſtoms of the ancient Iriſh, but life is ſhort, and, in ſome reſpect, it would be a pity that a man of genius ſhould waſte his time in ſuch purſuits.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B. <q rend="inline">To ſet a man of genius down to ſuch a taſk, would be to yoke a courſer of the ſun in a mud cart. No, no, one of your cool plodding half-burnt bricks of the creation would be the fitteſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world for ſuch ſtudies.</q>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. B. <q rend="inline">I could ſpeak a little of it when I was a boy, and I can remember a few words and phraſes ſtill. Poetry was highly cultivated by the ancient Iriſh; ſome of their kings were ſo ſmitten with the love of ſong as to exchange the ſceptre for the harp.</q>
               </p>
               <p>T. <q rend="inline">The bards were very much protected and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but having indulged too much in ſatire and ribaldry, they were rather dreaded than eſteemed, and, at one time, the whole body was on the eve of being baniſhed, if St. Columkill had not interfered.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. B. <q rend="inline">Sedulius was an excellent poet.</q>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. B. <q rend="inline">I read one of his hymns, that glowed with all the poet, the ſpirit of it might be ſaid to aſcend like the ſpirit of a Chriſtian martyr, in the midſt of flames, but I never could light on his works.</q>

               <p>Mr. B. <q rend="inline">Yes, yes, he could neither read nor write, nor ſpeak any language but his own. I have ſeen ſome of his effuſions tranſlated into Engliſh, but was aſſured, by judges, that they fell far ſhort of the original, yet they contained ſome graces <q rend="inline">"ſnatched beyond the reach of art."</q> I remember one thought in an addreſs to a friend; the poet adviſes him to loſe no time in paying his addreſſes to a young lady, for that ſhe was of age, and, as á proof of it, <q rend="inline">"upon her cheek he ſaw love's letter ſealed with a damaſk roſe."</q> Spencer, who was himſelf a bard, ſays, that

               <p>T. <q rend="inline">Great expectations were formed from Doctor Leland; he had leiſure, talents, and almoſt every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.

               <p>Mr. B. <q rend="inline">Mitres and coronets will dazzle, but the truth is, he had an eye to his bookſeller, and, to be candid, he went over it with a heavy hand.</q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The converſation turned on poetry, which Mr. Burke called <q rend="inline">"the art of ſubſtantiating ſhadows, and to lend exiſtence to nothing."</q> He praiſed Milton for the judicious choice of his epithets; this led him to ſay a few words on the uſe and abuſe of thoſe flowery adjectives, as Pontanus calls them, and lamented that ſome perſon of taſte did not collect a garland of them out of the Engliſh poets, as Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had out of the Latin, which laid every claſſical ſcholar under great obligation to him, as he had plucked the faireſt flowers that ſipped caſtalion dew.</p>
               <p>Geography, he ſaid, was an earthly ſubject, but a heavenly ſtudy. One of the company happened to mention ſome gentlemen who intended to promote diſcoveries in the interior parts of Africa, Mr. Burke ſaid, the intention was truly laudable; <q rend="inline">"Africa,"</q> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"was worth exploring, it ſeemed as if nature, in ſome great convulſion or revolution of her empire, had fled to that quarter with all her treaſures, ſome of which ſhe had concealed in the bowels of the earth, but the ſurface exhibited ſuch abundance and variety of the vegetable and animal race, that a few miles would enrich the conqueſts of natural hiſtory. Witneſs on the very ſhores of that continent—the cabbage-tree, that towered into all the ſublimity of the pine, and the luxuriance of the ſpreading oak, and yet ſo tender that a few ſtrokes of a fabre were ſufficient to lay it proſtrate on the earth. Africa was rightly called the mother of monſters, for there was not a ſufficient number of minor animals elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to feed the huge beaſts that ranged the foreſts in that country. He was perſuaded the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb n="cxvii" facs="tcp:0244800201:121"/>
was healthy, civilized, and ſo fertile, that the reaper trod on the heels of the ſower.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"But the thirſt of European avarice and cruelty had raiſed a barrier round the coaſts of that quarter, which prevented all communication with the inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive inhabitants. The ſight of a white face was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make their curly locks ſtand on end. Death is natural to man, but ſlavery unnatural, and the moment you ſtrip a man of his liberty, you ſtrip him of all his virtues; you convert his heart into a dark hole, in which all the vices conſpire againſt you."</q> Towards the cloſe of the converſation, he aſked me if I was acquainted with Mr. Sheridan; I anſwered, that I was very ſorry I could not boaſt that honour. I ſhall have the pleaſure, ſaid he, of introducing you to him, for he is one of the beſt natured men in the univerſe; he accompanied me, on my departure, to the door, and told me that Dr. King was a very learned man, aſſured me that he would be very happy to ſee me at Beconsfield, <q rend="inline">"throw yourſelf in a coach, ſaid he, come down and make my houſe your inn."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In 1788, ſeveral petitions were preſented to the Houſe of Commons, praying the abolition of the ſlave trade, and on the 9th of May, in the ſame year, Mr. Pitt moved and carried a reſolution founded on their petitions, the purport of which was, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the Houſe would proceed to the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that infamous traffic early in the next ſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke entered into this ſubject with the ſpirit of a man who felt for all mankind. His eloquence was never poured forth in a better cauſe—it was the cauſe of humanity. As he knew that he had intereſt and prejudice to contend with, he took the queſtion even on theſe grounds; he clearly evinced the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>policy of it, raiſed the African from that low ſcale of creation into which he had been thrown, up to the dignity of man, vindicated the wiſdom, goodneſs, and providence of God, in the formation, ſituation, and order of all his beings. His deſcription of a
<pb n="cxviii" facs="tcp:0244800201:122"/>
ſlave ſhip, and the unhappy wretches that were piled together in its womb, drew tears from many that heard him. He then ran out into an eulogy on humanity, in order to ſhew that man, diveſted of feeling, may be claſſed with the greateſt monſter.—The part which he took during his Majeſty's indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in 1788, is ſufficiently known. Mr. Burke's beſt friends muſt lament that he did not abſtain from ſome expreſſions on that melancholy occaſion, which have ſubtracted from the ſincerity of ſubſequent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. His ſovereign, however, treated him in a very different manner when he was afflicted by the hand of Providence. During the diſcuſſion of this buſineſs in parliament, Mr. Pitt addreſſed a letter to the Prince of Wales, dated 30th December, which ſtated, <q rend="inline">"that it was the opinion of his Majeſty's faithful ſervants, that His Royal Highneſs ſhould be empowered to exerciſe the royal authority during the illneſs, and in the name of his father; provided ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, that the care of the King's perſon, with the diſpoſition of his houſehold, ſhould be committed to the Queen; and that the power to be exerciſed by the Prince, ſhould not extend to the perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of his father; to the granting of any office, reverſion or penſion, except where the law abſolutely required it, as in the caſe of the judges, for any other term than during the King's pleaſure; nor to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of any peerage, unleſs upon ſuch perſons of the royal iſſue as ſhould have attained the age of twenty one years."</q> The Prince of Wales's anſwer was written by Mr. Burke, is dated Jan. 29, 1789. It is worthy of being preſented as a pure model of the epiſtolary ſtile, and expreſſive of the ſentiments of the Prince on a ſubject of the higheſt and moſt natural concern, and perſonal delicacy. After acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the receipt of Mr. Pitt's letter, <q rend="inline">"Nothing,"</q> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"done by the two Houſes of Parliament, could be a proper ſubject of his animadverſion; but when, previouſly to any diſcuſſion in parliament, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
<pb n="cxix" facs="tcp:0244800201:123"/>
of a ſcheme of government, in which it was propoſed that he ſhould be perſonally and principally concerned, and by which the royal authority and the public welfare might be deeply affected, were ſent to him for his conſideration, it would be unjuſtifiable in him to withhold an explicit declaration of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents. His ſilence might be conſtrued into a previous approbation of a plan, the accompliſhment of which every motive of duty to his father and ſovereign, as well as of regard for the public intereſt, obliged him to conſider as injurious to both. He did not expect that a plan, by which government was to be rendered difficult, if not impracticable, would be offered to his conſideration, at a moment when government, deprived of its chief energy and ſupport, ſeemed peculiarly to need the cordial and united aid of all deſcriptions of good ſubjects. He forbore to remark on the ſeveral parts of the ſketch laid before him. It was not probable that any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his would produce an alteration of ſentiment in the projectors of it. But he truſted to the wiſdom and juſtice of parliament, when the ſubject ſhould come under their deliberation. It was with deep regret that he perceived in the contents of Mr. Pitt's paper a project for introducing weakneſs, diſorder, inſecurity into every branch of political buſineſs;—a project for dividing the royal family from each other; for ſeparating the court from the ſtate; and depriving government of its natural and accuſtomed ſupport;—a ſcheme for diſconnecting the authority to command ſervice, from the power of animating it by reward; and for allotting to the prince all the invidious duties of government, without the means of ſoftening them to the public by any one act of grace, favour, or benignity. His feelings were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more painful by obſerving, that the plan was not founded in any general principle, but was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to infuſe jealouſies and ſuſpicions in that quarter, whoſe confidence it would ever be the firſt
<pb n="cxx" facs="tcp:0244800201:124"/>
pride of his life to merit and obtain. On the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and object of the reſtriction he had little to obſerve. Miniſters had only informed him what the powers were which they meant to refuſe, not why they were withheld. As the powers and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the crown were veſted there in truſt for the benefit of the people, and were ſecured only becauſe neceſſary to preſerve the point and balance of the conſtitution, the plea of public utility ought to be ſtrong, manifeſt, and urgent, which called for the extinction or ſuſpenſion of any one of thoſe eſſential rights in the ſupreme power or its repreſentatives, or which could juſtify the prince in conſenting, that in his perſon an experiment ſhould be made, to aſcertain with how ſmall a portion of the kingly power the executive government of the country might be carried on. If ſecurity for the king's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſing his rightful government were any part of the object of the propoſed plan, the prince had only to be convinced that any meaſure was neceſſary, or even conducive to that end, to be the firſt to urge it, as the preliminary and paramount conſideration of any ſettlement, in which he would conſent to ſhare. If attention to what it was preſumed might be the king's feelings and wiſhes on the happy day of his recovery were the object, it was with the trueſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity the prince expreſſed his firm conviction, that no event could be more repugnant to the feelings of his royal father, than to know, that the government of his ſon and repreſentative had exhibited the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power in a ſtate of degradation, of curtailed authority, and diminiſhed energy—a ſtate, hurtful in practice to the proſperity and good government of his people, and injurious in its precedent to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the monarch, and the rights of his family. The prince alſo felt himſelf compelled to remark, that it was not neceſſary for Mr. Pitt, nor proper, to ſuggeſt a reſtraint on his granting away the king's real and perſonal property: he did not conceive that
<pb n="cxxi" facs="tcp:0244800201:125"/>
he was by law entiled to make any ſuch grant; and he was ſure, that he never had ſhewn the ſmalleſt inclination to poſſeſs any ſuch power. He had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his duty in thus giving his free opinion of the plan. Yet, his conviction of the evils which might ariſe from the government of the country, remained longer in a maimed and debilitated ſtate, outweighed in his mind every other conſideration, and would determine him to undertake the painful truſt impoſed upon him by the preſent melancholy neceſſity (which of all the king's ſubjects he deplored the moſt) in full confidence, that the affection and loyalty to the king, the experienced attachment to the Houſe of Brunſwick, and the generoſity which had always diſtinguiſhed the nation, would carry him through the many difficulties, inſeparable from ſo critical a ſituation, with comfort to himſelf, with honour to the king, and with advantage to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Burke is alſo ſaid to have been the author of a ſpeech intended to have been delivered by the Duke of York in the upper Houſe on certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in the regency bill<note n="*" place="bottom">It is now in print.</note>. It abounds with elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and argument, and does not appear to have diminiſhed the writer's ſtock either of the one or the other, in the diſcuſſion of every ſtage of the bill. Mr. Burke ſometimes ruffled even the <hi>placid</hi> temper of Mr. Pitt in theſe debates. The latter called the former to order ſeveral times. Mr. Burke was not very fond of being interrupted in his flights, eſpecially when he mounted his fiery footed courſer, and dealt out his arrows in almoſt every direction, which happened to be one night the caſe; the firſt time he was arreſted in his career in a tone little leſs impaſſionate than his own, which did not eſcape his obſervation. <q rend="inline">"The Right Honourable Gentleman (Mr. Pitt) ſaid he, calls me to order in ſo mild a
<pb n="cxxii" facs="tcp:0244800201:126"/>
voice, that it reminds me of two lines which I once read in an old poet:—</q>
                  <q>
                     <l>There roar'd the prophet of the northern nation,</l>
                     <l>Scorch'd in a flaming ſpeech on moderation.</l>
                  </q>
He had not proceeded very far when he was called to order again by Mr. Pitt, with a ſmile, which Mr. Burke ſaid, reminded him of a line in another poet:
<q>
                     <l>There madneſs laugh'd in ireful mood.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The aſperities which paſſed betwixt theſe two gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen throughout the diſcuſſion of this bill, leſt little room to expect for that coalition which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards took place.</p>
               <p>On the 7th of March, 1788, Mr. Steele brought up the report of Mr. Pitt's Eaſt India Declaratory Bill. Mr. Burke declared, on the introduction of this bill that he would reſiſt it in every ſtage; he kept his word, and having exhauſted all his arguments, he flew to thoſe that were inexhauſtible in his hands—ſatyr and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry. He was particularly ſevere on Mr. Dundas. He compared the bill itſelf to a <hi>Polypus</hi> of pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; it came forward, he ſaid, like other inſects, in the humble form of an egg, then a caterpillar, then a fly, &amp;c. He then changed the ſimile, and ſaid, when it was firſt brought in it was ſhewn about like an abortion in a bottle. Such was the ſeverity of ſome of his remarks, that even Mr. Dundas evidently evinced that he felt ſore.</p>
               <p>On the 2d of March, 1790, Mr. Fox moved for leave to bring in a bill to repeal the Corporation and Teſt Acts. Mr. Burke oppoſed the motion in a ſpeech of conſiderable length, in the courſe of which he read ſeveral extracts from the political writings of Dr. Prieſtley, and commented on them with great acerbity and perſonal rancour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grey, actuated by the pureſt motives of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, brought in a bill for the relief of unfortunate debtors. Mr. Burke paid many handſome compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="cxxiii" facs="tcp:0244800201:127"/>
to the Honourable Mover, and the pains which he had taken to diſtinguiſh the unfortunate from the criminal. His (Mr. B's) deſcription of the firſt claſs was extremely pathetic and affecting. The facility of credit in this country, he obſerved, gave the creditor a raſh reſort to the perſon of debtor. The mind of the latter might be ſaid to be impriſoned even before his perſon was immured in the walls of a gaol. The ſight of a ſtrange face filled him with alarm, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a letter ſhook his nerves, and a knock at the door filled his breaſt with anxiety, ſuſpenſe, and fear: and after he had pined for ſome years in miſery and diſtreſs, if enlarged by an act of grace or inſolvency, he returned from the bare walls of a priſon to the bare walls of a gloomy apartment and a famiſhed family, with his credit blaſted, and every ray of hope tinged with deſpair.</p>
               <p>On the 27th of February, 1790, Mr. Flood gave notice that he intended, on the 4th of the next month, to move for leave to bring in a bill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the repreſentation in parliament. Mr. Burke requeſted his Honourable Friend (Mr. F.) would recal the notice he had juſt given, and abſtain from all diſcuſſion on the ſubject; the fire of liberty, as it was falſely called, had been kindled in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring country, and he did not wiſh that one of the ſparks of that flame ſhould fall in this, for it was not that mild temperate flame that might be called the emanation of reaſon, religion, and prudence; but a devouring fire, at which the ferocious demagogue lighted his brand. This was the firſt time that he mentioned the revolution of France in the Houſe of Commons. As he had touched on this ſubject, he ſcarce ever miſſed to introduce it in the moſt trivial debate. As Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Fox did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him to the full extent of all thoſe Philippics, it was eaſy to obſerve, from his countenance and ſome expreſſions which he dropt, that he meditated an attack on thoſe two gentlemen, which he carried
<pb n="cxxiv" facs="tcp:0244800201:128"/>
partly into execution on the report of the army eſtimates on the 5th of February, 1790. The manly openneſs and candour of Mr. Fox, and the mildneſs of his reply to what had fallen from Mr. Burke on that occaſion, ſeemed to have ſome effect in ſoothing his temper for the time, ſo that he did not pour out all the vials of his wrath; but on the 9th of the ſame month he came down to the Houſe, fully prepared to renew the attack; he began with a detail of the French revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from what he called the <hi>blood-bud</hi> of it to the time he was ſpeaking; he then entered into a hiſtory of the authors of it. Such a biographical ſketch was never exhibited; ſcarce could the imagination of a Shakeſpeare call ſuch a bloody, tyrannical, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing, ferocious, crew into exiſtence; ſuch a catalogue of crimes, ſuch a liſt of vices, were never caſt in the mint of human depravity: <q rend="inline">"Thoſe wretches,"</q> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"had loſt all pretenſion to the name of man; they, like Herod and Nero, looked on humanity to be weakneſs, virtue a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; their hearts could be only warmed with the ſacrilegious flames that devoured prieſts and altars; they naturalized murder, croaked and thirſted for blood and power, attempted to invert the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of nature, and called on <hi>confuſion</hi> as the <hi>order</hi> of the day.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Throughout the whole of this ſpeech Mr. Burke did not ſo much as touch on <hi>lettres de cachet,</hi> the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> or the farmers general, who drank the tears of the widows and orphans out of cups of gold.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fox complimented Mr. Burke on his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but repeated his former declaration, that if ever he could look at a ſtanding army with leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional jealouſy than before, it was now, ſince, during the late tranſactions in France, the army had manifeſted, that on becoming <hi>ſoldiers</hi> they did not ceaſe to continue <hi>citizens,</hi> and would not act as the mere inſtruments of a deſpot. This expreſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Mr. Burke's choler, and as his brain was well
<pb n="cxxv" facs="tcp:0244800201:129"/>
known to be a mint of phraſes, he attacked the French revolution with redoubled rage, nor was he choice of the epithets which he applied to Mr. Fox. They paſſed by him, it is true, like <q rend="inline">"the idle wind which he reſpected not,"</q> but his heart was ſo full to think of the conduct of a man who held ſo dear a place in it, that he burſt into tears. Mr. Sheridan roſe, and commented on Mr. Burke's ſpeech with ſuch irreſiſtible force of argument, eloquence, and poignancy of wit, that Mr. Burke immediately threw off the maſk, burſt into an open declaration of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities, and declared that his Honourable Friend and he were from that moment <hi>ſeparated in their politics for ever.</hi> His geſture and countenance on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing theſe words, were compared by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in the gallery to the ſoldier mentioned in Lucan's Pharſalia, who was bit by a ſerpent in the deſert of Lybia<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>
                        <l>Tendit cutem, pereunte figutâ,</l>
                        <l>Miſcens cuncta tumor; toto jam corpore major,</l>
                        <l>Humanumque egreſſa modum, ſuper omnia membra</l>
                        <l>Efflatur ſanies: late pollente veneno,</l>

                     </q>
                  </note>. Mr. Burke's conduct on this occaſion gave birth to various conjectures. It was ſuppoſed by ſome that he envied the talents of Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan, but truth is the daughter of time, and ſhe has ſince brought the whole to light.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke was amongſt the firſt to praiſe the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in Poland, but he was ſcarce ever heard to lament the fate of it. When he ſaw the foundation of that glorious edifice laid, he rejoiced at it, but when he ſaw it buried in ruins, he never was known to ſhed a tear over it. In commemoration of that promiſing event, in which, to uſe his own words, <q rend="inline">"every thing was kept in its place and order, but in that place and order every thing was bettered,"</q> the Poles ſtruck a medal of the late unfortuate
<pb n="cxxvi" facs="tcp:0244800201:130"/>
Poniatouſki, his majeſty ſent one of thoſe warm from the mint to Mr. Burke, with a letter in his own hand writing in the Engliſh language, as he ſaid, he thought it the moſt copious and energetic to convey the high ſenſe which he entertained of Mr. Burke's patriotiſm and talents. Mr. Burke returned a very polite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſtating that ſo high a mark of eſteem might be ſuppoſed to awaken his vanity, but it tended rather to encreaſe his veneration and eſteem for the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a prince whom he had long admired. He ſaid, he had no cabinet of medals, but that if he had the richeſt in the univerſe he was perſuaded he would be at a loſs in what illuſtrious ſeries he would place that of his majeſty. It muſt be placed as the firſt of a new one; he had a ſon, and happy would it be for him if he lived to be able to add a ſecond to it. He then launched out in praiſe of the Poliſh revolution, the origin and progreſs of which he aſcribed to the king; <q rend="inline">"You,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"that may be truly called the father and not the proprietor of your people."</q> He entreated his majeſty to pardon the length of the letter, as the language of command was brevity, but he was grown old, and fond of dwelling on a theme ſo dear to his heart, beſides it was the very nature of gratitude, that it thought it never could ſay enough.</p>
               <p>On the 30th of April, 1792, Mr. Grey brought forward the queſtion of parliamentary reform. Mr. Burke roſe immediately after Mr. Fox had delivered his opinion on this momentous queſtion. He claimed the indulgence of the Houſe as one that did not trouble them often, and one who was not to be impelled by a ſmall exigency. <q rend="inline">"He knew himſelf unfit for the general duties of the Houſe, and was not like the archbiſhop of Grenada, who, contrary to the motives and remonſtrances of his beſt friends, would not be perſuaded that his facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were on the decline, when found no longer fit for the ſituation he held, he could, without great
<pb n="cxxvii" facs="tcp:0244800201:131"/>
concern, obey the voice that warned him to <hi>retire;</hi> yet, after ſerving in that Houſe for twenty-ſeven years, he might ſtill be of ſome uſe in defending it's borders, as invalids, after wearing out their youth, and compacted manhood, are placed in garriſon, when diſcharged from the active duties of military life."</q> He inſiſted that a remedy ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to till the diſeaſe was pointed out, and that the grievances pointed out and exaggerated, did not exiſt, and that the attempt was merely to enſnare people by the gingle of the word <hi>reform,</hi> a word of five letters, and worth little more than the ſounds they conveyed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke ſtill affected a kind of whining friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for Mr. Fox; he did not riſe ſo often as uſual, and when he did, it was merely to introduce the French revolution. Almoſt every ſpeech which he delivered on this ſubject, might be divided into three parts, the tragic, the comic, and the farcical. In the laſt he often ſunk to mere buffoonery, but the whole was eloquent in general. It was in the firſt of theſe diviſions that he introduced the dagger ſcene; this was a practical trope, as Mr. Sheridan called it, and as he had declared a few minutes before, he drew that weapon from his boſom that neutrality was his motto. Mr. Courtenay humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly called it an armed neutrality as ſoon as he ſaw it in his hand. In one of his <hi>antigallican</hi> ſpeeches he drew a humourous picture of the metaphyſicians, rhetoricians, and politicians of France, in the courſe of which he illuſtrated the <hi>new lights</hi> of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with the following quotation:—
<q>
                     <l>So have I ſeen in larder dark,</l>
                     <l>Of veal a lucid loin,</l>
                     <l>Replete with many a brilliant ſpark,</l>
                     <l>(As wiſe philoſophers remark)</l>
                     <l>At once both <hi>ſtink</hi> and <hi>ſhine.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cxxviii" facs="tcp:0244800201:132"/>On the 18th of February, 1793, Mr. Fox brought forward a motion relative to the war. As Mr. Burke was at war with the French, at war with Mr. Fox; &amp;c. &amp;c. and at war with himſelf, this motion fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with an opportunity of pouring out all that he had bottled up on the ſubject. Towards the concluſion of his ſpeech, he entered into a character of all the individuals in France, with whom a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter from this country might be ſuppoſed to treat. From Roland down to Santerre he proteſted that the hangman was the only honeſt man in France; and that every man, woman, and child in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were murderers. He was extremely angry with Mr. Fox for calling the late King of Pruſſia a deſpot with reſpect to the part which he took in the plunder of Poland. He ſaid, he could buy a parrot for a ſhilling that could be taught to ſay deſpot, deſpot, from morn till night. Mr. Grey anſwered, that a parrot could be alſo taught to ſay murderer, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti, Briſſot, &amp;c. &amp;c. On the 4th of March, 1793, Mr. Sheridan moved for a committee to enquire into the ſeditious practices alleged to exiſt in the country. Mr. Burke continued to ſit in the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bench, but as ſoon as Mr. Sheridan had handed his motion to the Speaker, Mr. Burke ſtarted up, ran towards the Treaſury Bench, and when he got to the middle of the floor, he turned round, looked with an eye full of indignation on thoſe he had left behind him, and exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"<hi>I quit the camp, I quit the camp.</hi>"</q> Mr. Sheridan ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He hoped, as the Honourable Gentleman <hi>had quitted the camp as a deſerter, that he would not return as a ſpy.</hi>"</q>

               <p>In 1792, Mr. Burke addreſſed a letter to his friend, Sir H.

<pb n="cxxix" facs="tcp:0244800201:133"/>
the marks of the different ſtages of his life—the toys of childhood, the fire of youth, the vigour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the cool collected judgment of old age. He has endeavoured to prove in this pamphlet, that the aſcendancy of humanity, juſtice, and ſound policy ought to riſe ſuperior to the aſcendancy of any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſect or party—<hi>Religionis non eſt cogere religionem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 28th of February, 1793, Mr. Burke and his ſon withdrew their names from the Whig Club.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke's writings on the French revolution have been ſo univerſally read, that it is needleſs to make any remarks on them, and though they abound with many ſplendid paſſages, there is ſcarce an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal thought in the whole. The firſt pamphlet which he publiſhed on that ſubject is chiefly taken from the writings of Mallet du Pan. Having now retired on a penſion, it was thought that he would have laid down the pen, and enjoyed himſelf in the converſation of a few ſelect friends, or in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch writers as teach us to wean our affections from all ſublunary matters, eſpecially as he had loſt his ſon, the prop of his old age. In this ſituation, it was expected that he would have exclaimed with the poet on a ſimilar occaſion:
<q>
                     <l>Know all the diſtant din the world can keep,</l>
                     <l>Rolls o'er my grotto, and but ſooths my ſleep.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But his paſſions accompanied him whitherſoever he went, and in that very retirement he attacked the Duke of Bedford, becauſe that young nobleman diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his public duty. The privileged claſs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we believe will not conſider that attack as a trophy that ought to be hung on the Corinthian pillar of poliſhed ſociety. His conduct to Mr. Fox was rather myſterious, but his penſion explained it. He might have parted with his old friend in a more decent and dignified manner. He was envious of his great talents undoubtedly, and though artful enough in every other reſpect, he could not conceal
<pb n="cxxx" facs="tcp:0244800201:134"/>
it, for he complained in the Houſe of Commons that Mr. Fox's ſpeeches were detailed at greater length and with more fidelity than his own. It was ſtill more viſible one day with a man of letters, who made the following remark:—<hi>In Tullio omnes linguam mirantur, pectus non aequè: In Ariſtotele pectus omnes, linguam non item: In Foxio, pectus et linguam aequè.</hi> His irritability might be ſaid to have grown with his growth, and to have gathered ſtrength with his weakneſs, and there was ſcarce a ſhaft leveled at him in the public prints or other medium that he did not read. Some years ſince at dinner at Lord Tankerville's, the converſation turned on caricatures; a gentleman obſerved, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Mr. Fox had been oftener exhibited in that line than any other man in the kingdom. <q rend="inline">"I beg your pardon,'</q> ſaid Mr. Burke, <q rend="inline">"I think I may put in my claim to a greater number and variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions in that way than my honourable friend."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"I hope,"</q> ſaid Mr. Fox, <q rend="inline">"they give you no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Not in the leaſt,"</q> replied Mr. Burke, <q rend="inline">"I have ſeen them all, and I remember them all, and if it would not be treſpaſſing on the indulgence of the company, I could repeat the different cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in which I have been repreſented, obedient to the mimic powers of the pencil."</q> Accordingly he began and deſcribed them all in ſo humourous a manner as to ſet the table on a roar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke had only one child, a ſon; he was educated at Oxford, and returned for the borough of Malton, but never took his ſeat. As his health was viſibly on the decline, his father took lodgings for him at Brompton for the benefit of the air. He was attended by Doctor Brocklſby. His father was inconſolable, and in the agony of his grief wrung his hands one morning, and ſighed ſo deeply that his ſon overheard him, which induced him to riſe, dreſs, and walk down ſtairs, with the aſſiſtance of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. When he came to the door he pauſed to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="cxxxi" facs="tcp:0244800201:135"/>
ſtrength, walked in without any help, and ſeated himſelf on the ſopha between his father and mother; the day was fine; he roſe and repeated Milton's morning hymn, ſat down, roſe a ſecond time to repeat it again, but had ſcarce uttered a few lines when he ſunk into the arms of his parents, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired without a ſigh, in the thirty-ſeventh year of his age.</p>
               <p>Soon after Mr. Burke publiſhed his <hi>Reflections on the Revolution in France,</hi> it was intended to preſent him with the freedom of the univerſity of Dublin and other academic honours, but the warm part which he took in the queſtion of the emancipation of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, prevented that intention, it is ſaid, from being carried into effect, and if it even had it could not encreaſe his fame as a writer or ſpeaker. He did not truſt to his pen in promoting the cauſe of the Catholics, he ſent his ſon to Ireland for that purpoſe, who received a thouſand pounds for his miſſion. This induced many to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the zeal which was exhibited on that occaſion flowed from his attachment to the Romiſh Church, and the old erroneous ſtory of his being bred at St. Omers was revived. This queſtion being put one day to Dr. Doctor Goldſmith, <q rend="inline">"I don't ſee,"</q> ſaid the Doctor, <q rend="inline">"that he had any occaſion to be bred there."</q> To repel thoſe charges, he wrote a letter to Thomas Burgh, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Old Town, in Ireland, in which he ſtated, at full length, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which induced him to become the advocate of the Iriſh Catholics. When Mr. Burke was a young man it is ſaid that he attempted to write a tragedy, but that having ſhewn a few paſſages of it to a friend, he was perſuaded to turn his attention to ſome other literary line, in which he would ſhine to more advantage. His Eſſay on the Sublime and Beautiful was the firſt production of his pen that drew the attention of the learned. When the late Lord Cheſterfield firſt read it, he ſaid the ſublime was
<pb n="cxxxii" facs="tcp:0244800201:136"/>
beautiful, and the beautiful ſublime. As an orator Mr. Burke paid very little attention to the graces, as his utterance was in general vehement, his geſticula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion partook of the ſame paſſion. His reading was various, and he had the happy art of making every thing he read his own, ſo that his plagiariſm often eſcaped in the peculiar flow and modification of his words. His memory was tenacious, his imagination ſo fervid and head ſtrong, that it could ſcarce be reſtrained by his judgment, but ſwelled <q rend="inline">"due on, and ſcarce ever knew retiring ebb."</q> The ſolidity of his judgment was often loſt in the brilliancy of his fancy, as the ſolidity of the ſun is often loſt in the ſplendour of his beams. In the heat and whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind of his paſſions he fell at times into low ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as the rapid ſhowers in South America when they waſh down gold mingle it with common ſand. He was a great lover of agriculture, abſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious in his diet, and plain in his dreſs. His favorite maxim was, that the paſſions ought to inſtruct the reaſon; this, perhaps, may account for his conduct in the evening of his life. If he had paid more attention to his private affairs, his friends and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, perhaps, would not have to lament that he died a penſioner.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Grandeur of ſoul"</q> ſays a celebrated writer, <q rend="inline">"that haughtily ſtruggles with poverty, and will neither yield to, nor make terms with misfortunes; which through every ſituation repoſes a noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in itſelf, and has an immoveable view to future glory and honour, aſtoniſhes the world with admiration and delight. We, as it were, lean for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with ſurprize and trembling joy to behold the human ſoul collecting its ſtrength, and aſſerting a right to ſuperior fates."</q> During his laſt illneſs, Mr. Burke was attended by Doctor Lynn, of Windſor. A cancerous abſceſs had been long gathering in his ſide, which at laſt came to a ſuppuration. He was perfectly collected and ſound in his intellects to the
<pb n="cxxxiii" facs="tcp:0244800201:137"/>
laſt moment, and a few hours before his death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with ſome of his friends on political ſubjects. His enmity to the French republic continued to burn 'till the fuel was quite exhauſted. Having read one of Addiſon's papers in the Spectator, he felt himſelf ſo weak that he beckoned to be removed, and expired as his domeſtics were conveying him to his bed.</p>

               <p>As a ſenator he was uniformly attached to the party he ſet out with, and though his private fortune was far from being eſtabliſhed, and though different ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations would be proud to detach him, he roſe and fell with his party.</p>
               <p>He has been charged with not being always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to his own declarations and definitions; but before he is judged on this ground, times and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhould be well weighed. In our mixed conſtitution there are times when the power of the prince, or the people, may be alternately too much or too little, and the politician who now ſpeaks in favour of the one, and then of the other, may be equally conſiſtent. There was a period, not very remote from the preſent, when the power of the crown was thought <q rend="inline">"to have encreaſed, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, and ought to be diminiſhed;"</q> but now that democracy is taking ſuch hideous ſtrides in Europe, every Engliſhman feels it his duty to rally round the throne, as the beſt ſupport of freedom, ſubordination, and liberty.</p>
               <p>He was a firm profeſſor of the Chriſtian religion, and exerciſed its principles in its duties; wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, <q rend="inline">"that whatever diſunites man from God, diſunites man from man."</q> He looked within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the regulation of his conduct, which was exemplary in all the relations of life; he was warm in

his affections, ſimple in his manners, plain in his table, arrangements, &amp;c. &amp;c. and ſo little affected with the follies and diſſipations of what is called <q rend="inline">"the higher claſſes,"</q> that he was totally ignorant of them; ſo that this great man, with all his talents, would be mere lumber in a modern drawing-room; not but he excelled in all the refinements as well as ſtrength of converſation, and could, at times, badi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage with great ſkill and natural eaſe; but what are ſuch qualifications to a people where cards and dice conſtitute their buſineſs, and faſhionable vices their converſation.</p>

In this reſpect too, rigour, as uſual, defeats itſelf. Then, the Exchequer never gives a particular receipt, or clears a man of his account, as far as it goes.

            <p>GOD has planted in man a ſenſe of ambition, and a ſatisfaction ariſing from the contemplation of his excelling his fellows in ſomething deemed valuable amongſt them. It is this paſſion that drives men to all the ways we ſee in uſe of ſignalizing themſelves, and that tends to make whatever excites in a man the idea of this diſtinction ſo very pleaſant. It has been ſo ſtrong as to make very miſerable men take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that they were ſupreme in miſery; and certain it is, that where we cannot diſtinguiſh ourſelves by ſomething excellent, we begin to take a complacency in ſome ſingular infirmities, follies, or defects of one kind or other. It is on this principle that flattery is ſo prevalent; for flattery is no more than what raiſes in a man's mind an idea of a preference which he has not. Now, whatever, either on good or upon bad grounds, tends to raiſe a man in his own opinion, produces a ſort of ſwelling and triumph, that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely grateful to the human mind; and this ſwelling

is never more perceived, nor operates with more force, than when without danger we are converſant with terrible objects, the mind always claiming to itſelf ſome part of the dignity and importance of the things which it contemplates.

            <p>THE Athenians made a very rapid progreſs to the moſt enormous exceſſes; the people under no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint ſoon grew diſſipated, luxurious, and idle.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0244800201:146"/>
They renounced all labour, and began to ſubſiſt themſelves from the public revenues. They loſt all concern for their common honour or ſafety, and could bear no advice that tended to reform them. At this time truth became offenſive to thoſe lords the people, and moſt highly dangerous to the ſpeaker. The orators no longer aſcended the <hi>roſtrum,</hi> but to corrupt them further with the moſt fulſome adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe orators were all bribed by foreign princes on the one ſide or the other. And beſides its own parties, in this city there were parties, and avowed ones too, for the Perſians, Spartans, and Mac donians, ſupported each of them by one or more demagogues penſioned and bribed to this iniquitous ſervice. The people, forgetful of all virtue and public ſpirit, and intoxicated with the flatteries of their orators, (theſe courtiers of repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, and endowed with the diſtinguiſhing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics of all other courtiers) this people, I ſay, at laſt arrived at that pitch of madneſs, that they coolly and deliberately, by an expreſs law, made it capital for any man to propoſe an application of the immenſe ſums ſquandered in public ſhows, even to the moſt neceſſary purpoſes of the ſtate. When you ſee the people of this republic baniſhing or murdering their beſt and ableſt citizens, diſſipating the public treaſure with the moſt ſenſeleſs extravagance, and ſpending their whole time, as ſpectators or actors, in playing, fiddling, dancing, and ſinging, does it not, my Lord, ſtrike your imagination with the image of a ſort of a complex Nero?

This was the city which baniſhed Themiſtocles, ſtarved Ariſtides, forced into exile Miltiades, drove out Anaxagoras, and poiſoned Socrates. This was a city which changed the form of its government with the moon; eternal conſpiracies, revolutions daily, nothing fixed and eſtabliſhed. A republic, as an ancient philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher has obſerved, is no one ſpecies of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a magazine of every ſpecies; here you find every ſort of it, and that in the worſt form.

            <head>AMERICAN WAR (EFFECTS OF).</head>
            <p>THE act of which I ſpeak is among the fruits of the American war: a war, in my humble opinion, productive of many miſchiefs, of a kind which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it from all others. Not only our policy is deranged, and our empire diſtracted, but our laws and our legiſlative ſpirit appear to have been totally perverted by it. We have made war on our colonies, not by arms only, but by laws. As hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility and law are not very concordant ideas, every ſtep we have taken in this buſineſs, has been made by trampling on ſome maxim of juſtice, or ſome capital principle of wiſe government. What pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents were eſtabliſhed, and what principles over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0244800201:148"/>
(I will not ſay of Engliſh privilege but of general juſtice) in the Boſton Port, the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet's Charter, the Military Bill, and all that long array of hoſtile acts of parliament, by which the war with America has been begun and ſupported! Had the principles of any of theſe acts been firſt exerted on Engliſh ground, they would probably have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired as ſoon as they touched it. But by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from our perſons, they have rooted in our laws; and the lateſt poſterity will taſte the fruits of them.</p>
            <p>Nor is it the worſt effect of this unnatural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that our <hi>laws</hi> are corrupted. Whilſt <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> remain intire, they will correct the vices of law, and ſoften it at length to their own temper. But we have to lament, that in moſt of the late proceedings we ſee very few traces of that generoſity, humanity, and dignity of mind which formerly characterized this nation. War ſuſpends the rules of moral obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and what is long ſuſpended is in danger of being totally abrogated. Civil wars ſtrike deepeſt of all into the manners of the people. They vitiate their politics; they corrupt their morals; they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert even the natural taſte and reliſh of equity and juſtice. By teaching us to conſider our fellow-citizens in an hoſtile light, the whole body of our nation becomes gradually leſs dear to us. The very names of affection and kindred, which were the bond of charity whilſt we agreed, become new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives to hatred and rage, when the communion of our country is diſſolved. We may flatter our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that we ſhall not fall into this misfortune. But we have no charter of exemption, that I know of, from the ordinary frailties of our nature.</p>
            <p>What but that blindneſs of heart which ariſes from the phrenſy of civil contention, could have made any perſons conceive the preſent ſituation of the Britiſh affairs as an object of triumph to themſelves, or of congratulation to their ſovereign? Nothing,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0244800201:149"/>
ſurely, could be more lamentable to thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the flouriſhing days of this kingdom, than to ſee the inſane joy of ſeveral unhappy people, amidſt the ſad ſpectacle which our affairs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct exhibit to the ſcorn of Europe. We behold, (and it ſeems ſome people rejoice in beholding) our native land, which uſed to ſit the envied arbiter of all her neighbours, reduced to a ſervile dependence on their mercy; acquieſcing in aſſurances of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which ſhe does not truſt; complaining of hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which ſhe dares not reſent; deficient to her allies; lofty to her ſubjects, and ſubmiſſive to her enemies; whilſt the liberal government of this free nation is ſupported by the hireling ſword of German boors and vaſſals; and three millions of the ſubjects of Great Britain are ſeeking for protection to Engliſh privileges in the arms of France!</p>
            <p>Indeed our affairs are in a bad condition. I do aſſure thoſe gentlemen who have prayed for war, and obtained the bleſſing they have ſought, that they are, at this inſtant, in very great ſtraits.—<bibl>

It is not, gentlemen, it is not, to reſpect the diſpenſations of Providence, nor to provide any decent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in the mutability of human affairs.

            <p>THERE never, gentleman, was a period in which the ſtedfaſtneſs of ſome men has been put to ſo ſore a trial. It is not very difficult for well-formed minds to abandon their intereſt; but the ſeparation of ſame and virtue is an harſh divorce. Liberty is in danger of being made unpopular to Engliſhmen. Contending for an imaginary power we begin to acquire the ſpirit of domination and to loſe the reliſh of honeſt equality. The principles of our forefathers become ſuſpected to us, becauſe we ſee them animating the preſent oppoſition of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The faults which grow out of the luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of freedom, appear much more ſhocking to us, than the baſe vices which are generated from the rankneſs of ſervitude. Accordingly the leaſt reſiſtance to power appears more inexcuſable in our eyes than the greateſt abuſes of authority. All dread of a ſtanding military force is looked upon as a ſuperſtitious panic. All ſhame of calling in foreigners and ſavages in a civil conteſt is worn off. We grow indifferent to the conſequences inevitable to ourſelves from the plan of ruling half

he empire by a mercenary ſword. We are taught to believe that a deſire of domineering over our countrymen is love to our country; that thoſe who hate civil war abet rebellion, and that the amiable and conciliatory virtues of lenity, moderation, and tenderneſs to the privileges of thoſe who depend on this kingdom are a ſort of treaſon to the ſtate.</p>

This oppoſition continued until after our great, but moſt unfortunate victory at Long Iſland. Then all the mounds and banks of our conſtancy were borne down at once; and the phrenſy of the American war broke in upon us like a deluge. This victory, which ſeemed to put an immediate end to all difficulties, perfected us in that ſpirit of domination, which our unparalleled proſperity had but too long nurtured. We had been ſo very powerful, and ſo very proſperous, that even the humbleſt of us were degraded into the vices and follies of kings. We loſt all meaſure between means and ends; and our headlong deſires became our politics and our morals. All men who wiſhed for peace, or retained any ſentiments of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, were overborne or ſilenced; and this city was led by every artifice (and probably with the more management, becauſe I was one of your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) to diſtinguiſh itſelf by its zeal for that fatal cauſe.

Whilſt we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice, and behold them penetrating into the deepeſt frozen receſſes of Hudſon's Bay, and Davis's Streights, whilſt we are looking for them beneath the arctic circle, we hear that they have pierced into the oppoſite region of polar cold, that they are at the antipodes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged under the frozen ſerpent of the ſouth.

No ſea but what is vexed by their fiſheries. No climate that is not witneſs to their toils.

            <p>FIRST, the people of the colonies are deſcendants of England. England, Sir, is a nation, which ſtill
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0244800201:162"/>
I hope reſpects, and formerly adored, her freedom. The coloniſts emigrated from you, when this part of your character was moſt predominant; and they took this biaſs and direction the moment they parted from your hands. They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to Engliſh ideas, and on Engliſh principles. Abſtract liberty, like other mere abſtractions, is not to be found. Liberty inheres in ſome ſenſible object; and every nation has formed to itſelf ſome favourite point, which by way of eminence becomes the criterion of their happineſs. It happened, you know, Sir, that the great conteſts for freedom in this country were from the earlieſt times chiefly upon the queſtion of taxing. Moſt of the conteſts in the antient commonwealths turned pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily on the right of election of magiſtrates; or on the balance among the ſeveral orders of the ſtate. The queſtion of money was not with them ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate. But in England it was otherwiſe. On this point of taxes the ableſt pens, and moſt eloquent tongues, have been exerciſed; the greateſt ſpirits have acted and ſuffered. In order to give the fulleſt ſatisfaction concerning the importance of this point, it was not only neceſſary for thoſe who in argument defended the excellence of the Engliſh conſtitution, to inſiſt on this privilege of granting money as a dry point of fact, and to prove, that the right had been acknowledged in antient parchments, and blind uſages, to reſide in a certain body called an houſe of commons. They went much further; they attempted to prove, and they ſucceeded, that in theory it ought to be ſo, from the particular nature of a houſe of commons, as an immediate repreſentative of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; whether the old records had delivered this oracle or not. They took infinite pains to inculcate, as a fundamental principle, that, in all monarchies, the people muſt in effect themſelves mediately or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately poſſeſs the power of granting their own money, or no ſhadow of liberty could ſubſiſt. The
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0244800201:163"/>
colonies draw from you, as with their life-blood, theſe ideas and principles. Their love of liberty, as with you, fixed and attached on this ſpecific point of taxing. Liberty might be ſafe, or might be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in twenty other particulars, without their being much pleaſed or alarmed. Here they felt its pulſe; and as they found that beat, they thought themſelves ſick or ſound. I do not ſay whether they were right or wrong in applying your general arguments to their own caſe. It is not eaſy indeed to make a monopoly of theorems and corollaries. The fact is, that they did thus apply thoſe general arguments; and your mode of governing them, whether through lenity or indolence, through wiſdom or miſtake, confirmed them in the imagination, that they, as well as you, had an intereſt in theſe common principles.—<bibl>

            <p>PERMIT me, Sir, to add another circumſtance in our colonies, which contributes no mean part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the growth and effect of this untractable ſpirit. I mean their education. In no country perhaps in the world is the law ſo general a ſtudy. The profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion itſelf is numerous and powerful; and in moſt provinces it takes the lead. The greater number of the deputies ſent to the congreſs were lawyers. But all who read, and moſt do read, endeavour to obtain ſome ſmattering in that ſcience. I have been told by an eminent bookſeller, that in no branch of his buſineſs, after tracts of public devotion, were ſo many books as thoſe on the law exported to the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. The coloniſts have now fallen into the way of printing them for their own uſe. I hear that they have ſold nearly as many of Blackſtone's Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in America as in England. General Gage marks out this diſpoſition very particularly in a letter on your table. He ſtates, that all the people in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are lawyers, or ſmatterers in law, and that in Boſton they have been enabled, by ſucceſsful chicane, wholly to evade many parts of one of your capital penal conſtitutions. The ſmartneſs of debate will ſay, that this knowledge ought to teach them more clearly the rights of legiſlature, their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to obedience, and the penalties of rebellion. All this is mighty well. But my <note n="*" place="bottom">The Attorney General.</note> honourabe and learned friend on the floor, who condeſcends to mark

what I ſay for animadverſion, will diſdain that ground. He has heard, as well as I, that when great honours and great emoluments do not win over this knowledge to the ſervice of the ſtate, it is a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable adverſary to government.

Three thouſand miles of ocean lie between you and them. No contrivance can prevent the effect of this diſtance, in weakening government.

But to this ſcheme, there are two objections. The firſt, that there is already ſo much unſettled land in private hands, as to afford room for an immenſe future population, although the crown not only withheld its grants, but annihilated its ſoil. If this be the caſe, then the only effect of this avarice of deſolation, this hoarding of a royal wilderneſs, would be to raiſe the value of the poſſeſſions in the hands of the great private monopoliſts, without any adequate check to the growing and alarming miſchief of population.</p>
            <p>But, if you ſtopped your grants, what would be the conſequence? The people would occupy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grants. They have already ſo occupied in many

places. You cannot ſtation garriſons in every part of theſe deſerts. If you drive the people from one place, they will carry on their annual tillage, and remove with their flocks and herds to another. Many of the people in the back ſettlements are already little attached to particular ſituations. Already they have topped the Apalachian mountains. From thence they behold before them an immenſe plain, one vaſt, rich, level meadow; a ſquare of five hundred miles. Over this they would wander, without a poſſibility of reſtraint; they would change their manners with the habits of their life; would ſoon forget a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which they were diſowned; would become hordes of Engliſh Tartars; and, pouring down upon your unfortified frontiers a fierce and irreſiſtible cavalry, become maſters of your governors and your counſellors, your collectors and comptrollers, and of all the ſlaves that adhered to them.

Hear your officers abroad, and let them refute this ſhameleſs falſehood, who, in all their correſpondence, ſtate the diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances as owing to their true cauſes, the diſcontent of the people, from the taxes.

            <p>Sir, this vermin of court reporters, when they are forced into day upon one point, are ſure to burrow in another, but they ſhall have no refuge: I will make them bolt out of all their holes.

They ſay, that the oppoſition made in parliament to the ſtamp act at the time of its paſſing, encouraged the Americans to their reſiſtance. This has even formally appeared in print in a regular volume, from an advocate of that faction, a Dr. Tucker.

            <p>A noble lord, (Carmarthen) who ſpoke ſome time ago, is full of the fire of ingenuous youth; and when he has modelled the ideas of a lively imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by further experience, he will be an ornament to his country in either houſe. He has ſaid, that the Americans are our children, and how can they revolt againſt their parent? He ſays, that if they are not free in their preſent ſtate, England is not free; becauſe Mancheſter, and other conſiderable places, are not repreſented. So then, becauſe ſome towns in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are not repreſented, America is to have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative at all. They are <q rend="inline">"our children;"</q> but when children aſk for <hi>bread,</hi> we are not to give a <hi>ſtone.</hi> It is becauſe the natural reſiſtance of things, and the various mutations of time, hinders our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or any ſcheme of government, from being any more than a ſort of approximation to the right, is it therefore that the colonies are to recede from it infinitely? When this child of ours wiſhes to aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to its parent, and to reflect with a true filial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance the beauteous countenance of Britiſh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; are we to turn to them the ſhameful parts of our conſtitution? are we to give them our weakneſs for their ſtrength; our opprobrium for their glory; and the ſlough of ſlavery, which we are not able to work off, to ſerve them for their freedom?</p>
            <p>If this be the caſe, aſk yourſelves this queſtion, Will they be content in ſuch a ſtate of ſlavery? If
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0244800201:173"/>
not, look to the conſequences. Reflect how you are to govern a people, who think they ought to be free, and think they are not. Your ſcheme yields no reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue; it yields nothing but diſcontent, diſorder, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience; and ſuch is the ſtate of America, that after wading up to your eyes in blood, you could only end juſt where you begun; that is, to tax where no revenue is to be found, to—my voice fails me; my inclination, indeed, carries me no further—all is confuſion beyond it.</p>
            <p>Well, Sir, I have recovered a little, and before I ſit down I muſt ſay ſomething to another point with which gentlemen urge us. What is to become of the declaratory act, aſſerting the entireneſs of Britiſh legiſlative authority, if we abandon the practice of taxation?</p>
            <p>For my part I look upon the rights ſtated in that act, exactly in the manner in which I viewed them on its very firſt propoſition, and which I have often taken the liberty, with great humility, to lay before you. I look, I ſay, on the imperial rights of Great Britain, and the privileges which the coloniſts ought to enjoy under theſe rights, to be juſt the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable things in the world. The parliament of Great Britain ſits at the head of her extenſive em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in two capacities: one as the local legiſlature of this iſland, providing for all things at home, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and by no other inſtrument than the executive power.—The other, and I think her nobler capacity, is what I call her <hi>imperial character</hi>; in which, as from the throne of heaven, ſhe ſuperintends all the ſeveral inferior legiſlatures, and guides, and controls them all without annihilating any. As all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial legiſlatures are only co-ordinate to each other, they ought all to be ſubordinate to her; elſe they can neither preſerve mutual peace, nor hope for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual juſtice, nor effectually afford mutual aſſiſtance. It is neceſſary to coerce the negligent, to reſtrain the violent, and to aid the weak and deficient, by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0244800201:174"/>
the over-ruling plenitude of her power. She is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to intrude into the place of the others, whilſt they are equal to the common ends of their inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

The laws themſelves will not be reſpected, when thoſe who execute them are deſpiſed; and they will be deſpiſed, when their power is not immediate from the crown, or natural in the kingdom. Never were miniſters better ſupported in parliament. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary ſupport comes and goes with office, totally regardleſs of the man or the merit. Is government ſtrengthened? It grows weaker and weaker. The popular torrent gains upon it every hour. Let us learn from our experience. It is not ſupport that is wanting to government, but reformation. When mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry reſts upon public opinion, it is not, indeed, built upon a rock of adamant; it has, however, ſome ſtability. But when it ſtands upon private humour, its ſtructure is of ſtubble, and its foundation is on quickſand. I repeat it again—He that ſupports every adminiſtration, ſubverts all government. The reaſon is this: The whole buſineſs in which a court uſually takes an intereſt goes on at preſent equally well, in whatever hands, whether high or low, wiſe or fooliſh, ſcandalous or reputable; there is nothing, therefore, to hold it firm to any one body of men, or to any one conſiſtent ſcheme of politics. Nothing interpoſes, to prevent the full operation of all the

caprices and all the paſſions of a court upon the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the public. The ſyſtem of adminiſtration is open to continual ſhocks and changes, upon the principles of the meaneſt cabal, and the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible intrigue. Nothing can be ſolid and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent. All good men, at length, ſly with horror from ſuch a ſervice. Men of rank and ability, with the ſpirit which ought to animate ſuch men in a free ſtate, while they decline the juriſdiction of dark cabal on their actions and their fortunes, will, for both, chearfully put themſelves upon their country. They will truſt an inquiſitive and diſtinguiſhing parliament; becauſe it does enquire, and does diſtinguiſh. If they act well, they know, that in ſuch a parliament, they will be ſupported againſt any intrigue; if they act ill, they know that no intrigue can protect them. This ſituation, however awful, is honourable. But in one hour, and in the ſelf-ſame aſſembly, without any aſſigned or aſſignable cauſe, to be precipitated from the higheſt authority to the moſt marked neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, poſſibly into the greateſt peril of life and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is a ſituation full of danger, and deſtitute of honour.

            <p>THE paſſion which belongs to generation, merely as ſuch, is luſt only. This is evident in brutes, whoſe paſſions are more unmixed, and which purſue their purpoſes more directly than ours. The only diſtinction they obſerve with regard to their mates, is that of ſex. It is true, that they ſtick ſeverally to their own ſpecies in preference to all others. But this preference, I imagine, does not ariſe from any ſenſe of beauty which they find in their ſpecies, as Mr. Addiſon ſuppoſes, but from a law of ſome other kind, to which they are ſubject; and this we may fairly conclude, from their apparent want of choice amongſt thoſe objects to which the barriers of their ſpecies have confined them. But man, who is a creature adapted to a greater variety and intricacy of relation, connects with the general paſſion, the idea of ſome <hi>ſocial</hi> qualities, which direct and heighten the appetite which he has in common with all other
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0244800201:180"/>
animals; and as he is not deſigned, like them, to live at large, it is fit that he ſhould have ſomething to create a preference, and fix his choice; and this, in general, ſhould be ſome ſenſible quality; as no other can ſo quickly, ſo powerfully, or ſo ſurely produce its effect. The object, therefore, of this mixed paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which we call love, is the <hi>beauty</hi> of the <hi>ſex.</hi> Men are carried to the ſex in general, as it is the ſex, and by the common law of nature; but they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to particulars by perſonal <hi>beauty.</hi> I call beauty a ſocial quality; for where women and men, and not only they, but when other animals give us a ſenſe of joy and pleaſure in beholding them (and there are many that do ſo), they inſpire us with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of tenderneſs and affection towards their perſons; we like to have them near us, and we enter willingly into a kind of relation with them, unleſs we ſhould have ſtrong reaſons to the contrary. But to what end, in many caſes, this was deſigned, I am unable to diſcover; for I ſee no greater reaſon for a connection between man and ſeveral animals who are attired in ſo engaging a manner, than between him and ſome others who entirely want this attraction, or poſſeſs it in a far weaker degree. But it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that Providence did not make even this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, but with a view to ſome great end, though we cannot perceive diſtinctly what it is, as his wiſdom is not our wiſdom, nor our ways his ways.—<bibl>

            <p>OBSERVE that part of a beautiful woman where ſhe is, perhaps, the moſt beautiful, about the neck and breaſts; the ſmoothneſs; the ſoftneſs; the eaſy and inſenſible ſwell; the variety of the ſurface, which is never for the ſmalleſt ſpace the ſame; the deceitful maze, through which the unſteady eye ſlides giddily, without knowing where to fix, or whither it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. Is not this a demonſtration of that change of

ſurface, continual, yet hardly perceptible at any point, which forms one of the great conſtituents of beauty? It gives me no ſmall pleaſure to find that I can ſtrengthen my theory in this point, by the opinion of the very ingenious Mr. Hogarth; whoſe idea of the line of beauty I take in general to be extremely juſt. But the idea of variation, without attending ſo accurately to the <hi>manner</hi> of the variation, has led him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider angular figures as beautiful; theſe figures, it is true, vary greatly; yet they vary in a ſudden and broken manner; and I do not find any natural object which is angular, and at the ſame beautiful. Indeed few natural objects are entirely angular.—<bibl>

The beauty of women is conſiderably owing to their weakneſs or delicacy, and ſo even enhanced by their timidity, a quality of mind analogous to it. I would not here be underſtood to ſay, that weakneſs betraying very bad health has any ſhare in beauty; but the ill effect of this is not becauſe it is weakneſs, but becauſe the ill ſtate of health which produces ſuch weakneſs, alters the other conditions of beauty; the parts in ſuch a caſe collapſe; the bright colour, the <hi>lumen purpureum juventae,</hi> is gone; and the fine variation is loſt in wrinkles, ſudden breaks, and right lines.—<bibl>

            <head>BRITISH LIBERTY, AN ENTAILED INHERITANCE.</head>
            <p>FROM Magna Charta to the Declaration of Rights, it has been the uniform policy of our conſtitution to claim and aſſiſt our liberties, as an entailed inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance derived to us from our forefathers, and to be tranſmitted to our poſterity, as an eſtate ſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the people of this kingdom, without any reference whatever to any other more general or prior right. By this means our conſtitution preſerves an unity in ſo great a diverſity of its parts. We have an inheritable crown; an inheritable peerage; and an houſe of commons and a people inheriting privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, franchiſes, and liberties, from a long line of anceſtors.</p>
            <p>This policy appears to me to be the reſult of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reflection, or rather the happy effect of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing nature, which is wiſdom without reflection, and above it. A ſpirit of innovation is generally the reſult of a ſelfiſh temper and confined views. People will not look forward to poſterity, who never look backward to their anceſtors. Beſides, the people of England well know, that the idea of inheritance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes a ſure principle of conſervation, and a ſure principle of tranſmiſſion, without at all excluding a principle of improvement. It leaves acquiſition free,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0244800201:187"/>
but it ſecures what it acquires. Whatever advantages are obtained by a ſtate proceeding on theſe maxims, are locked faſt as in a ſort of family ſettlement; graſped as in a kind of mortmain for ever. By a conſtitutional policy, working after the pattern of nature, we receive, we hold, we tranſmit our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and our privileges, in the ſame manner in which we enjoy and tranſmit our property and our lives. The inſtitutions of policy, the goods of fortune, the gifts of Providence, are handed down to us and from us, in the ſame courſe and order. Our political ſyſtem is placed in a juſt correſpondence and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry with the order of the world, and with the mode of exiſtence decreed to a permanent body compoſed of tranſitory parts; wherein, by the diſpoſition of a ſtupendous wiſdom, moulding together the great myſterious incorporation of the human race, the whole, at one time, is never old, or middle-aged, or young, but in a condition of unchangeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, moves on through the varied tenor of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual decay, fall, renovation, and progreſſion.—Thus, by preſerving the method of nature in the conduct of the ſtate, in what we improve we are never wholly new; in what we retain, we are never wholly obſolete. By adhering in this manner and on theſe principles to our forefathers, we are guided not by the ſuperſtition of antiquarians, but by the ſpirit of philoſophic analogy. In this choice of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance we have given to our frame of polity the image of a relation in blood; binding up the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our country with our deareſt domeſtic ties; adopting our fundamental laws into the boſom of our family affections; keeping inſeparable, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing with the warmth of all their combined and mutually reflected charities, our ſtate, our hearths, our ſepulchres, and our altars.</p>
            <p>Through the ſame plan of a conformity to nature in our artificial inſtitutions, and by calling in the aid of her unerring and powerful inſtincts, to fortify the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0244800201:188"/>
fallible and feeble contrivances of our reaſon, we have derived ſeveral other, and thoſe no ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, from conſidering our liberties in the light of an inheritance. Always acting as if in the preſence of canonized forefathers, the ſpirit of freedom, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in itſelf to miſrule and exceſs, is tempered with an awful gravity. This idea of a liberal deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires us with a ſenſe of habitual native dignity, which prevents that upſtart inſolence almoſt inevitably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to and diſgracing thoſe who are the firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers of any diſtinction. By this means our liberty becomes a noble freedom. It carries an impoſing and majeſtic aſpect; it has a pedigree and illuſtrating anceſtors; it has its bearings and its enſigns armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials; it has its gallery of portraits; its monumental inſcriptions; its records, evidences, and titles.

I can allow in clergymen, through all their diviſions, ſome tenaciouſneſs of their own opinion; ſome overflowings of zeal for its propagation; ſome predilection to their own ſtate and office; ſome attachment to the intereſt of their own corps; ſome preference to thoſe who liſten with docility to their doctrines, beyond thoſe who ſcorn and deride them. I allow all this, becauſe I am a man who have to deal with men, and who would not, through a violence of toleration, run into the greateſt of all intolerance.

prejudice deſtitute of reaſon, but involving in it profound and extenſive wiſdom. I ſpeak of it firſt. It is firſt, and laſt, and midſt in our minds. For, taking ground on that religious ſyſtem, of which we are now in poſſeſſion, we continue to act on the early received, and uniformly continued ſenſe of mankind. That ſenſe not only, like a wiſe architect, hath built up the auguſt fabric of ſtates, but like a provident proprietor, to preſerve the ſtructure from prophanation and ruin, as a ſacred temple, purged from all the impurities of fraud, and violence, and injuſtice, and tyranny, hath ſolemnly and for ever conſecrated the commonwealth, and all that officiate in it. This conſecration is made, that all who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter in the government of men, in which they ſtand in the perſon of God himſelf, ſhould have high and worthy notions of their function and deſtination; that their hope ſhould be full of immortality; that they ſhould not look to the paltry pelf of the moment, nor to the temporary and tranſient praiſe of the vulgar, but to a ſolid, permanent exiſtence, in the permanent part of their nature, and to a permanent fame and glory, in the example they leave as a rich inheritance to the world.</p>
            <p>Such ſublime principles ought to be infuſed into perſons of exalted ſituations; and religious eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments provided, that may continually revive and enforce them. Every ſort of moral, every ſort of civil, every ſort of politic inſtitution, aiding the rational and natural ties that connect the human underſtanding and affections to the divine, are not more than neceſſary, in order to build up that wonderful ſtructure, Man; whoſe prerogative it is, to be in a great degree a creature of his own making; and who when made as he ought to be made, is deſtined to hold no trivial place in the creation.

            <head>OBSERVATIONS ON THE NATURE AND CHARAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, (SEE KING'S MEN.</head>
            <p>I HAVE my eye chiefly on the Houſe of Commons. I hope I ſhall be indulged in a few obſervations on the nature and character of that aſſembly; not with regard to its <hi>legal form and power,</hi> but to its <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and to the purpoſes it is meant to anſwer in the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons was ſuppoſed originally to be <hi>no part of the ſtanding government of this country.</hi> It was conſidered as a <hi>controul,</hi> iſſuing <hi>immediately</hi> from the people, and ſpeedily to be reſolved into the maſs from whence it aroſe. In this reſpect it was in the higher part of government what juries are in the lower. The capacity of a magiſtrate being tranſitory, and that of a citizen permanent, the latter capacity it was hoped would of courſe preponderate in all diſcuſſions, not only between the people and the ſtanding authority of the crown, but between the people and the fleeting authority of the Houſe of Commons itſelf. It was hoped that, being of a middle nature between ſubject and government, they would feel with a more tender and a nearer intereſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0244800201:196"/>
every thing that concerned the people, than the other remoter and more permanent parts of legiſlature.</p>
            <p>Whatever alterations time and the neceſſary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of buſineſs may have introduced, this character can never be ſuſtained, unleſs the Houſe of Commons ſhall be made to bear ſome ſtamp of the actual diſpoſition of the people at large. It would (among public misfortunes) be an evil more natural and tolerable, that the Houſe of Commons ſhould be infected with every <hi>epidemical phrenſy</hi> of the people, as this would indicate <hi>ſome conſanguinity, ſome ſympathy</hi> of nature with their conſtituents, than that they ſhould in all caſes be wholly untouched by the opinions and feelings of the people out of doors. By this want of ſympathy they would ceaſe to be an Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. For it is not the derivation of the power of that Houſe from the people, which makes it in a diſtinct ſenſe their repreſentative. The King is the repreſentative of the people; ſo are the lords; ſo are the judges. They all are truſtees for the people, as well as the Commons; becauſe no power is given for the ſole ſake of the holder; and although go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment certainly is an inſtitution of divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, yet its forms, and the perſons who adminiſter it, all originate from the people.</p>
            <p>A popular origin cannot therefore be the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtical diſtinction of a popular repreſentative. This belongs equally to all parts of government, and in all forms. The virtue, ſpirit, and eſſence of a Houſe of Commons conſiſts in its being the expreſs image of the feelings of the nation. It was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed to be a controul <hi>upon</hi> the people, as of late <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

Other inſtitutions have been formed for the purpoſe of checking popular exceſſes; and they are, I apprehend, fully adequate to their object. If not, they ought to be made ſo. The Houſe of Commons, as it was never intended for the ſupport of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0244800201:197"/>
peace and ſubordination, is miſerably appointed for that ſervice; having no ſtronger weapon than its mace, and no better officer than its ſerjeant at arms, which it can command of its own proper authority. A vigilant and jealous eye over executory and judicial magiſtracy; an anxious care of public money, an openneſs, approaching towards facility, to public complaint: theſe ſeem to be the true characteriſtics of an Houſe of Commons. But an addreſſing Houſe of Commons, and a petitioning nation; an Houſe of Commons full of confidence, when the nation is plunged in deſpair; in the utmoſt harmony with miniſters, whom the people regard with the utmoſt abhorrence; who vote thanks, when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachments; who are eager to grant, when the general voice demands account; who, in all diſputes between the people and adminiſtration, preſume againſt the people; who puniſh their diſorders, but refuſe even to inquire into the provocations to them; this is an unnatural, a monſtrous ſtate of things in this conſtitution.

monument of vengeance; and to put perpetual deſolation as a barrier between him and thoſe againſt whom the faith which holds the moral elements of the world together was no protection. He became at length ſo confident of his force, ſo collected in his might, that he made no ſecret whatſoever of his dreadful reſolution. Having terminated his diſputes with every enemy, and every rival, who buried their mutual animoſities in their common deteſtation againſt the creditors of the Nabob of Arcot, he drew from every quarter whatever a ſavage ferocity could add to his new rudiments in the arts of deſtruction; and compounding all the materials of fury, havock, and deſolation, into one black cloud, he hung for a while on the declivities of the mountains. Whilſt the authors of all theſe evils were idly and ſtupidly gazing on this menacing meteor, which blackened all their horizon, it ſuddenly burſt, and poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the Carnatic. Then enſued a ſcene of woe, the like of which no eye had ſeen, no heart conceived, and which no tongue can adequately tell. All the horrors of war before known or heard of, were mercy to that new havock. A ſtorm of univerſal fire blaſted every field, conſumed every houſe, deſtroyed every temple. The miſerable inhabitants flying from their flaming villages, in part were ſlaughtered; others, without regard to ſex, to age, to the reſpect of rank, or ſacredneſs of function; fathers torn from children, huſbands from wives, enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry, and amidſt the goading ſpears of drivers, and the trampling of purſuing horſes, were ſwept into captivity, in an unknown and hoſtile land. Thoſe who were able to evade this tempeſt, fled to the walled cities. But eſcaping from fire, ſword, and exile, they fell into the jaws of famine.</p>
            <p>The alms of the ſettlement, in this dreadful exigency, were certainly liberal; and all was done by charity that private charity could do: but it was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0244800201:199"/>

I was going to awake your juſtice towards this unhappy part of our fellow citizens, by bringing before you ſome of the circumſtances of this plague of hunger. Of all the calamities which beſet and waylay the life of man, this comes the neareſt to our heart, and is that wherein the proudeſt of us all feels himſelf to be nothing more than he is: but I find myſelf unable to manage it with decorum; theſe details are of a ſpecies of horror ſo nauſeous and diſguſting; they are ſo degrading to the ſufferers and to the hearers; they are ſo humiliating to human nature itſelf, that, on better thoughts, I find it more adviſeable to throw a pall over this hideous object, and to leave it to your general conceptions.</p>

            <p>THE Carnatic is a country not much inferior in extent to England. Figure to yourſelf, Mr. Speaker, the land in whoſe repreſentative chair you ſit; figure to yourſelf the form and faſhion of your ſweet and cheerful country from Thames to Trent, north and ſouth, and from the Iriſh to the German ſea eaſt and weſt, emptied and embowelled (May God avert the omen of our crimes!) by ſo accompliſhed a deſolation. Extend your imagination a little further, and then ſuppoſe your miniſters taking a ſurvey of this ſcene of waſte and deſolation; what would be your thoughts if you ſhould be informed, that they were computing how much had been the amount of the exciſes, how much the cuſtoms, how much the land and malt tax, in order that they ſhould charge (take it in the moſt favourable light) for public ſervice, upon the relics of the ſatiated vengeance of relentleſs enemies, the whole of what England had yielded in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberant ſeaſons of peace and abundance? What would you call it? To call it tyranny, ſublimed into madneſs, would be too faint an image; yet this very madneſs is the principle upon which the miniſters at your right hand have proceeded in their eſtimate of the revenues of the Carnatic, when they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding, not ſupply for the eſtabliſhments of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, but rewards for the authors of its ruin.</p>
            <p>Every day you are fatigued and diſguſted with this cant,

They think they are talking to innocents, who will believe that by ſowing of dragons teeth, men may come up ready grown and ready armed. They who will give themſelves the trouble of conſidering (for it requires no great reach of thought, no very profound knowledge) the manner in which mankind are increaſed, and countries cultivated, will regard all this raving as it ought to be regarded. In order that the people, after a long period of vexation and plunder, may be in a condition to maintain govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, government muſt begin by maintaining them. Here the road to oeconomy lies not through receipt, but through expence; and in that country nature has given no ſhort cut to your object. Men muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate, like other animals, by the mouth. Never did oppreſſion light the nuptial torch; never did extortion and uſury ſpread out the genial bed.</p>
            <p>Does any of you think that England, ſo waſted, would, under ſuch a nurſing attendance, ſo rapidly and cheaply recover? But he is meanly acquainted with either England or India, who does not know that England would a thouſand times ſooner reſume population, fertility, and what ought to be the ultimate ſecretion from both, revenue, than ſuch a country as the Carnatic.</p>
            <p>The Carnatic is not by the bounty of nature a fertile ſoil. The general ſize of its cattle is proof enough that it is much otherwiſe. It is ſome days ſince I moved, that a curious and intereſting map, kept in the India Houſe, ſhould be laid before you. The India Houſe is not yet in readineſs to ſend it; I have therefore brought down my own copy, and there it lies for the uſe of any gentleman who may think ſuch a matter worthy of his attention. It is indeed a noble map, and of noble things; but it is deciſive againſt the golden dreams and ſanguine ſpeculations of avarice run mad. In addition to what you know muſt be the caſe in every part of the world (the neceſſity of a previous proviſion of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0244800201:202"/>
ſeed, ſtock, capital) that map will ſhew you, that the uſe of the influences of Heaven itſelf, are in that country a work of art. The Carnatic is refreſhed by few or no living brooks or running ſtreams, and it has rain only at a ſeaſon; but its product of rice exacts the uſe of water ſubject to perpetual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. This is the national bank of the Carnatic, on which it muſt have a perpetual credit, or it periſhe irretrievably. For that reaſon, in the happier times of India, a number almoſt incredible of reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs have been made in choſen places throughout the whole country; they are formed, for the greater part, of mounds of earth and ſtones, with ſluices of ſolid maſonry; the whole conſtructed with admirable ſkill and labour, and maintained at a mighty charge. In the territory contained in that map (Mr. Barnard's map of the Jaghire) alone, I have been at the trouble of reckoning the reſervoirs, and they amount to upwards of eleven hundred, from the extent of two or three acres to five miles in circuit. From theſe reſervoirs currents are occaſionally drawn over the fields, and theſe water-courſes again call for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable expence to keep them properly ſcoured and duly levelled. Taking the diſtrict in that map as a meaſure, there cannot be in the Carnatic and Tanjore fewer than ten thouſand of theſe reſervoirs of the larger and middling dimenſions, to ſay nothing of thoſe for domeſtic ſervices, and the uſe of religious purification. Theſe are not the enterprizes of your power, nor in a ſtyle of magnificence ſuited to the taſte of your miniſter. Theſe are the monuments of real kings, who were the fathers of their people; teſtators to a poſterity which they embraced as their own. Theſe are the grand ſepulchres built by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; but by the ambition of an unſatiable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, which, not contented with reigning in the diſpenſation of happineſs during the contracted term of human life, had ſtrained, with all the reachings and graſpings of a vivacious mind, to extend the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0244800201:203"/>
dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature, and to perpetuate themſelves through generations of generations, the guardians, the protectors, the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhers of mankind.</p>
            <p>What, Sir, would a virtuous and enlightened mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry do on the view of the ruins of ſuch works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them? On the view of ſuch a chaſm of deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as that which yawned in the midſt of thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to the north and ſouth, which ſtill bore ſome veſtiges of cultivation? They would have reduced all their moſt neceſſary eſtabliſhments; they would have ſuſpended the juſteſt payments; they would have employed every ſhilling derived from the producing to re-animate the powers of the unproductive parts. While they were performing this fundamental duty, whilſt they were celebrating theſe myſteries of juſtice and humanity, they would have told the corps of <hi>fictitious creditors,</hi> whoſe crimes were their claims, that they muſt keep an awful diſtance; that they muſt ſilence their inauſpicious tongues; that they muſt hold off their profane unhallowed paws from this holy work; they would have proclaimed with a voice that ſhould make itſelf heard, that on every country the <hi>firſt</hi> creditor is the <hi>plow</hi>; that this original, indefeaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble claim ſuperſedes every other demand.</p>
            <p>This is what a wiſe and virtuous miniſtry would have done and ſaid. This, therefore, is what our miniſter could never think of ſaying or doing. A miniſtry of another kind would have firſt improved the country, and have thus laid a ſolid founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for future opulence and future force. But on this grand point of the reſtoration of the country, there is not one ſyllable to be found in the correſpondence of our miniſters, from the firſt to the laſt; they felt nothing for a land deſolated by fire, ſword, and famine; their ſympathies took an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other direction; they were touched with pity for bribery, ſo long tormented with a fruitleſs itching of

            <p>WE know, that the convocation of the clergy had formerly been called, and ſat with nearly as much regularity to buſineſs as parliament itſelf. It is now called for form only.

            <head>CABINET (THE DOUBLE.)</head>
            <p>IT muſt be remembered, that ſince the revolution, until the period we are ſpeaking of, the influence of the crown had been always employed in ſupporting the miniſters of ſtate, and in carrying on the public buſineſs according to their opinions. But the party now in queſtion is formed upon a very different idea. It is to intercept the favour, protection and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the crown in the paſſage to its miniſters; it is to come between them and their importance in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; it is to ſeparate them from all their natural and acquired dependencies; it is intended as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, not the ſupport, of adminiſtration. The ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chinery of this ſyſtem is perplexed in its movements, and falſe in its principle. It is formed on a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion that the king is ſomething external to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that he may be honoured and aggrandized, even by its debility and diſgrace. The plan pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds expreſsly on the idea of enfeebling the regular executory power. It proceeds on the idea of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the ſtate in order to ſtrengthen the court. The ſcheme depending entirely on diſtruſt, on diſconnec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0244800201:206"/>
on mutability by principle, on ſyſtematic weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in every particular member; it is impoſſible that the total reſult ſhould be ſubſtantial ſtrength of any kind.</p>
            <p>As a foundation of their ſcheme, the cabal have eſtabliſhed a ſort of <hi>rota</hi> in the court. All ſorts of parties, by this means, have been brought into admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, from whence few have had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to eſcape without diſgrace; none at all without conſiderable loſſes. In the beginning of each ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement no profeſſions of confidence and ſupport are wanting, to induce the leading men to engage. But while the miniſters of the day appear in all the pomp and pride of power, while they have all their canvas ſpread out to the wind, and every ſail filled with the fair and proſperous gale of royal favour, in a ſhort time they find, they know not how, a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which ſets directly againſt them; which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents all progreſs; and even drives them backwards. They grow aſhamed and mortified in a ſituation, which, by its vicinity to power, only ſerves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind them the more ſtrongly of their inſignificance. They are obliged either to execute the orders of their inferiors, or to ſee themſelves oppoſed by the natural inſtruments of their office. With the loſs of their dignity they loſe their temper. In their turn they grow troubleſome to that cabal, which, whether it ſupports or oppoſes, equally diſgraces and equally betrays them. It is ſoon found neceſſary to get rid of the heads of adminiſtration; but it is of the heads only. As there always are many rotten members belonging to the beſt connections, it is not hard to perſuade ſeveral to continue in office without their leaders. By this means the party goes out much thinner than it came in; and is only reduced in ſtrength by its temporary poſſeſſion of power. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if by accident, or in courſe of changes, that power ſhould be recovered, the junto have thrown up a retrenchment of theſe carcaſes, which may ſerve
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0244800201:207"/>
to cover themſelves in a day of danger. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, not unwiſely, that ſuch rotten members will become the firſt objects of diſguſt and reſentment to their antient connexions.</p>
            <p>They contrive to form in the outward adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion two parties at the leaſt; which, whilſt they are tearing one another to pieces, are both competitors for the favour and protection of the cabal; and, by their emulation, contribute to throw every thing more and more into the hands of the interior ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers.</p>
            <p>A miniſter of ſtate will ſometimes keep himſelf totally eſtranged from all his colleagues; will differ from them in their councils, will privately traverſe, and publicly oppoſe, their meaſures, He will, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, continue in his employment. Inſtead of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any mark of diſpleaſure, he will be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by an unbounded profuſion of court rewards and careſſes; becauſe he does what is expected, and all that is expected, from men in office. He helps to keep ſome form of adminiſtration in being, and keeps it at the ſame time as weak and divided as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>However, we muſt take care not to be miſtaken, or to imagine that ſuch perſons have any weight in their oppoſition. When, by them, adminiſtration is convinced of its inſignificancy, they are ſoon to be convinced of their own. They never are ſuffered to ſucceed in their oppoſition. They and the world are to be ſatisfied, that, neither office, nor authority, nor property, nor ability, eloquence, counſel, ſkill, or union, are of the leaſt importance; but that the mere influence of the court, naked of all ſupport, and deſtitute of all management, is abundantly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for all its own purpoſes.</p>
            <p>When any adverſe connexion is to be deſtroyed, the cabal ſeldom appear in the work themſelves. They find out ſome perſon of whom the party enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an high opinion. Such a perſon they endeavour
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0244800201:208"/>
to delude with various pretences. They teach him firſt to diſtruſt, and then to quarrel with his friends; among whom, by the ſame arts, they excite a ſimilar diffidence of him; ſo that, in this mutual fear and diſtruſt, he may ſuffer himſelf to be employed as the inſtrument in the change which is brought about. Afterwards they are ſure to deſtroy him in his turn, by ſetting up in his place ſome perſon in whom he had himſelf repoſed the greateſt confidence, and who ſerves to carry off a conſiderable part of his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>As in deſtroying their enemies they make uſe of inſtruments not immediately belonging to their corps, ſo in advancing their own friends they purſue exactly the ſame method. To promote any of them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable rank or emolument, they commonly take care that the recommendation ſhall paſs through the hands of the oftenſible miniſtry: ſuch a recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation might however appear to the world, as ſome proof of the credit of miniſters, and ſome means of increaſing their ſtrength. To prevent this, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo advanced are directed, in all companies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly to declare, that they are under no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations whatſoever to adminiſtration; that they have received their office from another quarter; that they are totally free and independent.</p>
            <p>When the faction has any job of lucre to obtain, or of vengeance to perpetrate, their way is, to ſelect, for the execution, thoſe very perſons to whoſe habits, friendſhips, principles, and declarations, ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings are publicly known to be the moſt adverſe; at once to render the inſtruments the more odious, and therefore the more dependent, and to prevent the people from ever repoſing a confidence in any appearance of private friendſhip, or public principle.</p>
            <p>If the adminiſtration ſeem now and then, from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſneſs, or from fear of making themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable, to ſuffer any popular exceſſes to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, the cabal immediately ſets up ſome creature
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0244800201:209"/>
of theirs to raiſe a clamour againſt the miniſters, as having ſhamefully betrayed the dignity of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then they compel the miniſtry to become active in conferring rewards and honours on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have been the inſtruments of their diſgrace; and, after having firſt vilified them with the higher orders for ſuffering the laws to ſleep over the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of the populace, they drive them (in order to make amends for their former inactivity) to ſome act of atrocious violence, which renders them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely abhorred by the people.</p>
            <p>They who remember the riots which attended the Middleſex election; the opening of the preſent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and the tranſactions relative to Saint George's Fields, will not be at a loſs for an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe remarks.</p>
            <p>That this body may be enabled to compaſs all the ends of its inſtitution, its members are ſcarcely ever to aim at the high and reſponſible offices of the ſtate. They are diſtributed with art and judgment through all the ſecondary, but efficient, departments of office, and through the houſeholds of all the branches of the royal family: ſo as on one hand to occupy all the avenues to the throne; and on the other to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or fruſtrate the execution of any meaſure, according to their own intereſts. For with the credit and ſupport which they are known to have, though for the greater part in places which are only a genteel excuſe for ſalary, they poſſeſs all the influence of the higheſt poſts; and they dictate publicly in almoſt every thing, even with a parade of ſuperiority. Whenever they diſſent (as it often happens) from their nominal leaders, the trained part of the ſenate, inſtinctively in the ſecret, is ſure to follow them; provided the leaders, ſenſible of their ſituation, do not of themſelves recede in time from their moſt declared opinions. This latter is generally the caſe. It will not be conceivable to any one who has not ſeen it, what pleaſure is taken by the cabal in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0244800201:210"/>
theſe heads of office thoroughly contemptible and ridiculous. And when they are become ſo, they have then the beſt chance for being well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
            <p>The members of the court faction are fully indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified for not holding places on the ſlippery heights of the kingdom, not only by the lead in all affairs, but alſo by the perfect ſecurity in which they enjoy leſs conſpicuous, but very advantageous ſituations. Their places are, in expreſs legal tenure, or in effect, all of them for life. Whilſt the firſt and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable perſons in the kingdom are toſſed about like tennis balls, the ſport of a blind and inſolent caprice, no miniſter dares even to caſt an oblique glance at the loweſt of their body. If an attempt be made upon one of this corps, immediately he flies to ſanctuary, and pretends to the moſt inviolable of all promiſes. No conveniency of public arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is available to remove any one of them from the ſpecific ſituation he holds; and the ſlighteſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon one of them, by the moſt powerful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, is a certain preliminary to his own deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Conſcious of their independence, they bear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a lofty air to the exterior miniſters. Like Janiſſaries, they derive a kind of freedom from the very condition of their ſervitude. They may act juſt as they pleaſe; provided they are true to the great ruling principle of their inſtitution. It is, therefore, not at all wonderful, that people ſhould be ſo deſirous of adding themſelves to that body, in which they may poſſeſs and reconcile ſatisfactions the moſt alluring, and ſeemingly the moſt contradictory; enjoying at once all the ſpirited pleaſure of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and all the groſs lucre and ſat emoluments of ſervitude.</p>

            <p>CONNEXION and faction are equivalent terms, is an opinion which has been carefully inculcated at all times by unconſtitutional ſtateſmen. The reaſon is evident. Whilſt men are linked together, they eaſily and ſpeedily communicate the alarm of any evil deſign. They are enabled to fathom it with common counſel, and to oppoſe it with united ſtrength. Whereas, when they lie diſperſed, without concert, order, or diſcipline, communication is uncertain, counſel difficult, and reſiſtance impracticable. Where men are not acquainted with each other's principles, nor experienced in each other's talents, nor at all practiſed in their mutual habitudes and diſpoſitions by joint efforts in buſineſs; no perſonal confidence, no friendſhip, no common intereſt, ſubſiſting among them; it is evidently impoſſible that they can act a public part with uniformity, perſeverance, or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. In a connexion, the moſt inconſiderable man, by adding to the weight of the whole, has his value, and his uſe; out of it, the greateſt talents are wholly unſerviceable to the public. No man, who is not

            <p>DARKNESS is more productive of ſublime ideas than light. Our great poet was convinced of this; and indeed ſo full was he of this idea, ſo entirely poſſeſſed with the power of a well-managed darkneſs, that in deſcribing the appearance of the Deity, amidſt that profuſion of magnificent images which the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of his ſubject provokes him to pour out upon every ſide, he is far from forgetting the obſcurity which ſurrounds the moſt incomprehenſible of all beings, but

And what is no leſs remarkable, our author had the ſecret of preſerving this idea, even when he ſeemed to depart the fartheſt from it, when he deſcribes the light and glory which flows from the divine preſence; a light which by its very exceſs is converted into a ſpecies of darkneſs.</p>

            <p>THERE are two capital faults in our law with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to civil debts. One is, that every man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed ſolvent. A preſumption, in innumerable caſes, directly againſt truth. Therefore the debtor is ordered, on a ſuppoſition of ability and fraud, to be coerced his liberty until he makes payment. By this means, in all caſes of civil inſolvency without a pardon from his creditor, he is to be impriſoned for life:—and thus a miſerable miſtaken invention of artificial ſcience, operates to change a civil into a criminal judgment, and to ſcourge misfortune or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion with a puniſhment which the law does not inflict on the greateſt crimes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0244800201:215"/>The next fault is, that the inflicting of that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not on the opinion of an equal and public judge; but is referred to the arbitrary diſcretion of a private, nay intereſted, and irritated individual. He, who formally is, and ſubſtantially ought to be, the judge, is in reality no more than miniſterial, a mere executive inſtrument of a private man, who is at once judge and party. Every idea of judicial order is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by this procedure. If the inſolvency be no crime, why is it puniſhed with arbitrary impriſonment? If it be a crime, why is it delivered into private hands to pardon without diſcretion, or to puniſh without mercy and without meaſure?—<bibl>

            <p>THESE old eſtabliſhments were formed alſo on a third principle, ſtill more adverſe to the living oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the age.

There, every commodity, received in its raweſt condition, went through all the proceſs which fitted it for uſe. This inconvenient receipt produced an oeconomy ſuited only to itſelf. It multiplied offices beyond all meaſure; buttery, pantry, and all that rabble of places, which, though profitable to the holders and expenſive to the ſtate, are almoſt too mean to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—<bibl>

            <p>EXTENSION is either in length, height, or depth. Of theſe the length ſtrikes leaſt; an hundred yards of even ground will never work ſuch an effect as a tower an hundred yards high, or a rock or mountain of that altitude.

            <p>FOUR hundred years have gone over us; but I believe we are not materially changed ſince that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. Thanks to our ſullen reſiſtance to innovation, thanks to the cold ſluggiſhneſs of our national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, we ſtill bear the ſtamp of our forefathers. We have not (as I conceive) loſt the generoſity and dignity of thinking of the fourteenth century; nor as yet have we ſubtilized ourſelves into ſavages. We are not the converts of Rouſſeau; we are not the diſciples of Voltaire; Helvetius has made no progreſs amongſt us. Atheiſts are not our preachers; madmen are not our lawgivers. We know that <hi>we</hi> have made no diſcoveries; and we think that no diſcoveries are to be made in morality; nor many in the great principles of government, nor in the ideas of liberty, which were underſtood long before we

were born, altogether as well as they will be after the grave has heaped its mould upon our preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ſilent tomb ſhall have impoſed its law on our pert loquacity. In England we have not yet been completely embowelled of our natural entrails; we ſtill feel within us, and we cheriſh and cultivate thoſe inbred ſentiments which are the faithful guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, the active monitors of our duty, the true ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of all liberal and manly morals. We have not been drawn and truſſed, in order that we may be filled, like ſtuffed birds in a muſeum, with chaff and rags, and paltry blurred ſhreds of paper about the rights of man. We preſerve the whole of our feelings ſtill native and entire, unſophiſticated by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry and infidelity. We have real hearts of fleſh and blood beating in our boſoms. We fear God; we look up with awe to kings; with affection to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; with duty to magiſtrates; with reverence to prieſts; and with reſpect to nobility<note n="*" place="bottom">The Engliſh are, I conceive, miſrepreſented in a Letter pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in one of the papers, by a gentleman thought to be a diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſter.—When writing to Dr. Price, of the ſpirit which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails at Paris, he ſays,

            <p>You ſee, Sir, that in this enlightened age I am bold enough to confeſs, that we are generally men

of untaught feelings; that inſtead of caſting away all our old prejudices, we cheriſh them to a very conſiderable degree, and, to take more ſhame to ourſelves, we cheriſh them becauſe they are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices; and the longer they have laſted, and the more generally they have prevailed, the more we cheriſh them. We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private ſtock of reaſon; becauſe we ſuſpect that this ſtock in each man is ſmall, and that the individuals would do better to avail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the general bank and capital of nations, and of ages. Many of our men of ſpeculation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of exploding general prejudices, employ their ſagacity to diſcover the latent wiſdom which prevails in them.

            <head>FRANCE. Old Conſtitution of France—Conſequences of the Revolution.</head>
            <p>YOU might, if you pleaſed, have profited of our example, and have given to your recovered freedom a correſpondent dignity. Your privileges, though diſcontinued, were not loſt to memory. Your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0244800201:222"/>
it is true, whilſt you were out of poſſeſſion, ſuffered waſte and dilapidation; but you poſſeſſed in ſome parts the walls, and in all the foundations of a noble and venerable caſtle. You might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired thoſe walls; you might have built on thoſe old foundations. Your conſtitution was ſuſpended before it was perfected; but you had the elements of a conſtitution very nearly as good as could be wiſhed. In your old ſtates you poſſeſſed that variety of parts correſponding with the various deſcriptions of which your community was happily compoſed; you had all that combination, and all that oppoſition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, you had that action and counteraction which, in the natural and in the political world, from the reciprocal ſtruggle of diſcordant powers, draws out the harmony of the univerſe. Theſe oppoſed and conflicting intereſts, which you conſidered as ſo great a blemiſh in your old and in our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, interpoſe a ſalutary check to all precipitate reſolutions. They render deliberation a matter not of choice, but of neceſſity; they make all change a ſubject of <hi>compromiſe,</hi> which naturally begets mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; they produce <hi>temperaments,</hi> preventing the ſore evil of harſh, crude, unqualified reformations; and rendering all the headlong exertions of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, in the few or in the many, for ever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable. Through that diverſity of members and intereſts, general liberty had as many ſecurities as there were ſeparate views in the ſeveral orders; whilſt by preſſing down the whole by the weight of a real monarchy, the ſeparate parts would have been prevented from warping and ſtarting from their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted places.</p>
            <p>You had all theſe advantages in your ancient ſtates; but you choſe to act as if you had never been mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into civil ſociety, and had every thing to begin anew. You began ill, becauſe you began by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing every thing that belonged to you. You ſet up your trade without a capital. If the laſt genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0244800201:223"/>
of your country appeared without much luſtre in your eyes, you might have paſſed them by, and derived your claims from a more early race of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, Under a pious predilection for thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, your imaginations would have realized in them a ſtandard of virtue and wiſdom, beyond the vulgar practice of the hour: and you would have riſen with the example to whoſe imitation you aſpired. Reſpecting your forefathers, you would have been taught to reſpect yourſelves. You would not have choſen to conſider the French as a people of yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, as a nation of low-born ſervile wretches until the emancipating year of 1789. In order to furniſh, at the expence of your honour, an excuſe to your apologiſts here for ſeveral enormities of yours, you would not have been content to be repreſented as a gang of Maroon ſlaves, ſuddenly broke looſe from the houſe of bondage, and therefore to be pardoned for your abuſe of the liberty to which you were not accuſtomed, and ill fitted. Would it not, my worthy friend, have been wiſer to have you thought, what I, for one, always thought you, a generous and gallant nation, long miſled to your diſadvantage by your high and romantic ſentiments of fidelity, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and loyalty; that events had been unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you, but that you were not enſlaved through any illiberal or ſervile diſpoſition; that in your moſt devoted ſubmiſſion, you were actuated by a principle of public ſpirit, and that it was your country you worſhipped, in the perſon of your king? Had you made it to be underſtood, that in the deluſion of this amiable error you had gone further than your wiſe anceſtors; that you were reſolved to reſume your ancient privileges, whilſt you preſerved the ſpirit of your ancient and your recent loyalty and honour; or, if diffident of yourſelves, and not clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the almoſt obliterated conſtitution of your anceſtors, you had looked to your neighbours in this land, who had kept alive the ancient principles and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0244800201:224"/>
models of the old common law of Europe melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and adapted to its preſent ſtate—by following wiſe examples you would have given new examples of wiſdom to the world. You would have rendered the cauſe of liberty venerable in the eyes of every worthy mind in every nation. You would have ſhamed deſpotiſm from the earth, by ſhewing that freedom was not only reconcileable, but as, when well diſciplined, it is auxiliary to law. You would have had an unoppreſſive but a productive revenue. You would have had a flouriſhing commerce to feed it. You would have had a free conſtitution; a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent monarchy; a diſciplined army; a reformed and venerated clergy; a mitigated but ſpirited nobility, to lead your virtue, not to overlay it; you would have had a liberal order of commons, to emulate and to recruit that nobility; you would have had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, ſatisfied, laborious, and obedient people, taught to ſeek and to recognize the happineſs that is to be found by virtue in all conditions; in which conſiſts the true moral equality of mankind, and not in that monſtrous fiction, which, by inſpiring falſe ideas and vain expectations into men deſtined to travel in the obſcure walk of laborious life, ſerves only to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and imbitter that real inequality, which it never can remove; and which the order of civil life eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes as much for the benefit of thoſe whom it muſt leave in an humble ſtate, as thoſe whom it is able to exalt to a condition more ſplendid, but not more happy. You had a ſmooth and eaſy career of felicity and glory laid open to you, beyond any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the hiſtory of the world; but you have ſhewn that difficulty is good for man.</p>
            <p>Compute your gains: ſee what is got by thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and preſumptuous ſpeculations which have taught your leaders to deſpiſe all their predeceſſors, and all their contemporaries, and even to deſpiſe themſelves, until the moment in which they became truly deſpicable. By following thoſe falſe lights,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0244800201:225"/>
France has bought undiſguiſed calamities at a higher price than any nation has purchaſed the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal bleſſings! France has bought poverty by crime! France has not ſacrificed her virtue to her intereſt; but ſhe has abandoned her intereſt, that ſhe might proſtitute her virtue. All other nations have begun the fabric of a new government, or the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of an old, by eſtabliſhing originally, or by enforcing with greater exactneſs ſome rites or other of religion. All other people have laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of civil freedom in ſeverer manners, and a ſyſtem of a more auſtere and maſculine morality. France, when ſhe let looſe the reins of regal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, doubled the licence, of a ferocious diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in manners, and of an inſolent irreligion in opinions and practices; and has extended through all ranks of life, as if ſhe were communicating ſome privilege, or laying open ſome ſecluded benefit, all the unhappy corruptions that uſually were the diſeaſe of wealth and power. This is one of the new prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of equality in France.</p>
            <p>France, by the perfidy of her leaders, has utterly diſgraced the tone of lenient council in the cabinets of princes, and diſarmed it of its moſt potent topics. She has ſanctified the dark ſuſpicious maxims of tyrannous diſtruſt; and taught kings to tremble at (what will hereafter be called) the deluſive plauſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of moral politicians. Sovereigns will conſider thoſe who adviſe them to place an unlimited confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their people, as ſubverters of their thrones; as traitors who aim at their deſtruction, by leading their eaſy good-nature, under ſpecious pretences, to admit combinations of bold and faithleſs men into a participation of their power. This alone (if there were nothing elſe) is an irreparable calamity to you and to mankind. Remember that your parliament of Paris told your king, that in calling the ſtates to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he had nothing to fear but the prodigal exceſs of their zeal in providing for the ſupport of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0244800201:226"/>
throne. It is right that theſe men ſhould hide their heads. It is right that they ſhould bear their part in the ruin which their counſel has brought on their ſovereign and their country. Such ſanguine decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations tend to lull authority aſleep; to encourage it raſhly to engage in perilous adventures of untried policy; to neglect thoſe proviſions, preparations, and precautions, which diſtinguiſh benevolence from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility; and without which no man can anſwer for the ſalutary effect of any abſtract plan of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or of freedom. For want of theſe, they have ſeen the medicine of the ſtate corrupted into its poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. They have ſeen the French rebel againſt a mild and lawful monarch, with more fury, outrage, and inſult, than ever any people has been known to riſe againſt the moſt illegal uſurper, or the moſt ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary tyrant. Their reſiſtance was made to conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; their revolt was from protection; their blow was aimed at an hand holding out graces, favours, and immunities.</p>
            <p>This was unnatural. The reſt is in order. They have found their puniſhment in their ſucceſs. Laws overturned; tribunals ſubverted; induſtry without vigour; commerce expiring; the revenue unpaid, ye the people impoveriſhed; a church pillaged, and a ſtate not relieved; civil and military anarchy made the conſtitution of the kingdom; every thing human and divine ſacrificed to the idol of public credit, and national bankruptcy the conſequence; and to crown all, the paper ſecurities of new, precarious, tottering power, the diſcredited paper ſecurities of impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed fraud, and beggared rapine, held out as a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency for the ſupport of an empire, in lieu of the two great recognized ſpecies that repreſent the laſting conventional credit of mankind, which diſappeared and hid themſelves in the earth from whence they came, when the principle of poverty, whoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and repreſentatives they are, ſyſtematically ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.—<bibl>

            <head>FRENCH BISHOPS.</head>
            <p>YOU had before your revolution about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty biſhops. A few of them were men of eminent ſanctity. When we talk of the heroic, of courſe we talk of rare virtue. I believe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of eminent depravity may be as rare amongſt them as thoſe of tranſcendent goodneſs. Examples of avarice and of licentiouſneſs may be picked out, I do not queſtion it, by thoſe who delight in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation which leads to ſuch diſcoveries. A man, as old as I am, will not be aſtoniſhed that ſeveral, in every deſcription, do not lead that perfect life of ſelf-denial, with regard to wealth or to pleaſure, which is wiſhed for by all, by ſome expected, but by none exacted with more rigour, than by thoſe who are the moſt attentive to their own intereſts, or the moſt indulgent to their own paſſions. When I was in France, I am certain that the number of vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous prelates was not great. Certain individuals among them, not diſtinguiſhable for the regularity of their lives, made ſome amends for their want of the ſevere virtues, in their poſſeſſion of the liberal; and were endowed with qualities which made them uſeful in the church and ſtate. I am told, that with few exceptions, Louis the Sixteenth had been more attentive to character, in his promotions to that rank, than his immediate predeceſſor; and I believe, (as ſome ſpirit of reform has prevailed through the whole reign) that it may be true. But the preſent ruling power has ſhewn a diſpoſition only to plunder the church. It has puniſhed <hi>all</hi> prelates; which is to favour the vicious, at leaſt, in point of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It has made a degrading penſionary eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which no man, of liberal ideas, or liberal condition will deſtine his children. It muſt ſettle into the loweſt claſſes of the people. As with you the inferior clergy are not numerous enough for their duties; as theſe duties are, beyond meaſure, minute
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0244800201:228"/>
and toilſome; as you have left no middle claſſes of clergy at their eaſe, in future nothing of ſcience or erudition can exiſt in the Gallican church. To complete the project, without the leaſt attention to the rights of patrons, the aſſembly has provided in future an elective clergy; an arrangement which will drive out of the clerical profeſſion all men of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety; all who can pretend to independence in their function or their conduct; and which will throw the whole direction of the public mind into the hands of a ſet of licentious, bold, crafty, factious, flattering wretches, of ſuch condition and ſuch habits of life as will make their contemptible penſions (in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of which the ſtipend of an exciſeman is lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative and honourable) an object of low and illiberal intrigue. Thoſe officers, whom they ſtill call biſhops, are to be elected to a proviſion comparatively mean, through the ſame arts, (that is, electioneering arts) by men of all religious tenets that are known or can be invented. The new lawgivers have not aſcertained any thing whatſoever concerning their qualifications, relative either to doctrine or to morals; no more than they have done with regard to the ſubordinate clergy; nor does it appear but that both the higher and the lower may, at their diſcretion, practiſe or preach any mode of religion or irreligion that they pleaſe. I do not yet ſee what the juriſdiction of biſhops over their ſubordinates is to be; or whether they are to have any juriſdiction at all.—<bibl>

            <p>WHEN my occaſions took me into France, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of the late reign, the clergy, under all their forms, engaged a conſiderable part of my curioſity. So far from finding (except from one ſet of men, not then very numerous, though very active) the complaints and diſcontents againſt that body,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0244800201:229"/>
which ſome publications had given me reaſon to expect, I perceived little or no public or private uneaſineſs on their account. On further examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I found the clergy in general, perſons of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate minds and decorous manners; I include the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and the regulars of both ſexes. I had not the good fortune to know a great many of the paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial clergy; but in general I received a perfectly good account of their morals, and of their attention to their duties. With ſome of the higher clergy I had a perſonal acquaintance; and of the reſt in that claſs, very good means of information. They were, almoſt all of them, perſons of noble birth. They reſembled others of their own rank; and where there was any difference, it was in their favour. They were more fully educated than the military nobleſſe; ſo as by no means to diſgrace their profeſſion by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or by want of fitneſs for the exerciſe of their authority. They ſeemed to me, beyond the clerical character, liberal and open; with the hearts of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and men of honour; neither inſolent nor ſervile in their manners and conduct. They ſeemed to me rather a ſuperior claſs; a ſet of men, amongſt whom you would not be ſurprized to find a <hi>Fenelon.</hi> I ſaw among the clergy in Paris (many of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription are not to be met with any where) men of great learning and candour; and I had reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that this deſcription was not confined to Paris. What I found in other places, I know was accidental; and therefore to be preſumed a fair ſample. I ſpent a few days in a provincial town, where, in the abſence of the biſhop, I paſſed my evenings with three cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen, his vicars general, perſons who would have done honour to any church. They were all well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; two of them of deep, general, and extenſive erudition, ancient and modern, oriental and weſtern; particularly in their own profeſſion. They had a more extenſive knowledge of our Engliſh divines than I expected; and they entered into the genius of thoſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0244800201:230"/>
writers with a critical accuracy. One of theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen is ſince dead, the Abbé <hi>Morangis.</hi> I pay this tribute, without reluctance, to the memory of that noble, reverend, learned, and excellent perſon; and I ſhould do the ſame, with equal chearfulneſs, to the merits of the others, who, I believe, are ſtill liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if I did not fear to hurt thoſe whom I am unable to ſerve.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe eccleſiaſtics of rank, are, by all titles, perſons deſerving of general reſpect. They are deſerving of gratitude from me, and from many Engliſh. If this letter ſhould ever come into their hands, I hope they will believe there are thoſe of our nation who feel for their unmerited fall, and for the cruel confiſcation of their fortunes, with no common ſenſibility. What I ſay of them is a teſtimony, as far as one feeble voice can go, which I owe to truth. Whenever the queſtion of this unnatural perſecution is concerned, I will pay it. No one ſhall prevent me from being juſt and grateful. The time is fitted for the duty; and it is particularly becoming to ſhew our juſtice and gratitude, when thoſe who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved well of us and of mankind are labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der popular obloquy and the perſecutions of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive power.—<bibl>

            <p>I KNOW ſomething of the conſtitution and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this very extraordinary republic. It has a conſtitution, I admit, ſimilar to the preſent tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous military tyranny of France, by which an handful of obſcure ruſſians domineer over a fertile country and a brave people. For the compoſition, too, I admit, the Algerine community reſembles that of France, being the very ſcum, ſcandal, diſgrace, and peſt of the Turkiſh Aſia. The Grand Seignior, to diſburthen the country, ſuffers the Dey to recruit, in his dominions, the corps of Janiſſaries, or Aſaphs which form the Directory, or Council of Elders of the African Republic, one and indiviſible. But notwithſtanding this reſemblance, which I allow, I never ſhall ſo far injure the Janiſſarian republic of Algiers, as to put it in compariſon for every ſort of crime, turpitude, and oppreſſion, with the Jacobin republic of Paris. There is no queſtion with me to which of the two I ſhould chuſe to be a neighbour or a ſubject. But ſituated as I am, I am in no danger of becoming to Algiers either the one or the other. It is not ſo in my relation to the atheiſtical fanatics of France. Have the gentlemen, who borrowed this happy parallel, no idea of the different conduct to be held with regard to the very ſame evil at an immenſe diſtance, and when it is at your door? when its power is enormous, as when it is comparatively as feeble as its diſtance is remote? and when there is a barrier of languages and uſages, which prevents your being corrupted through certain old correſpondences and habitudes, which cannot for a long time be ſo wholly taken away, as not to make many of your people ſuſceptible of contagion from horrible novelties that are introduced into every thing elſe? I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template, without horror, a royal or a national tyger
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0244800201:238"/>
on the borders of Pegu. I can look at him, with an eaſy curioſity, as priſoner within bars in the mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie of the Tower. But if, by Habeas Corpus, or otherwiſe, he was to come into the lobby of the Houſe of Commons, whilſt your door was open, any of you would be more ſtout than wiſe, who would not gladly make his eſcape out of the back windows. This ambaſſador from Bengal would diſperſe you ſooner than a diſſolution by Royal prerogative. I certainly ſhould dread more from a wild cat in my bed-chamber, than from all the lions that roar in the deſerts behind Algiers. But in this parallel it is the cat that is at a diſtance, and the lions and tygers that are in our anti-chambers and our lobbies. Algiers is not near; Algiers is not powerful; Algiers is not our neighbour; Algiers is not infectious. Algiers, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be, is not an old creation; and we have good data to calculate all the miſchief to be expected from it. When I find Algiers transferred to Calais, I will tell you what I think of that point. In the mean time, the caſe quoted from the Algerine reports will not apply as authority.

No man who has attended to the particulars of what has been done in France, and combined them with the principles there aſſerted, can poſſibly doubt it. When I compare with this great cauſe of nations, the trifling points of honour, the ſtill more contemptible points of intereſt, the light ceremonies, the undefinable punctilios, the diſputes about precedency, the lowering or the hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſail, the dealing in a hundred or two of wild cat-ſkins on the other ſide of the globe, which have

Far from any reſemblance to thoſe propoſitions in geometry and metaphyſics, which admit no medium, but muſt be true or falſe in all their latitude; ſocial and civil freedom, like all other things in common life, are variouſly mixed and modified, enjoyed in very different degrees, and ſhaped into an infinite diverſity of forms, according to the temper and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of every community. The <hi>extreme</hi> of liberty (which is its abſtract perfection, but its real fault) obtains no where, nor ought to obtain any where.

It is thus with all thoſe, who, attending only to the ſhell and huſk of hiſtory, think they are waging war with intolerance, pride, and cruelty, whilſt, under colour of abhorring the ill principles of antiquated parties, they are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing and feeding the ſame odious vices in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent factions, and perhaps in worſe.</p>
            <p>Your citizens of Paris formerly had lent themſelves as the ready inſtruments to ſlaughter the followers of Calvin, at the infamous maſſacre of St. Bartholomew. What ſhould we ſay to thoſe who could think of retaliating on the Pariſians of this day the abominations and horrors of that time? They are indeed brought to abhor <hi>that</hi> maſſacre. Ferocious as they are, it is not difficult to make them diſlike it; becauſe the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians and faſhionable teachers have no intereſt in giving their paſſions exactly the ſame direction. Still however they find it their intereſt to keep the ſame ſavage diſpoſitions alive. It was but the other day that they cauſed this very maſſacre to be acted on the ſtage for the diverſion of the deſcendants of thoſe who committed it. In this tragic farce they produced the cardinal of Lorraine in his robes of function, ordering general ſlaughter. Was this ſpectacle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make the Pariſians abhor perſecution, and loath the effuſion of blood?—No, it was to teach
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0244800201:250"/>
them to perſecute their own paſtors; it was to excite them, by raiſing a diſguſt and horror of their clergy, to an alacrity in hunting down to deſtruction an order, which, if it ought to exiſt at all, ought to exiſt not only in ſafety, but in reverence: It was to ſtimulate their cannibal appetites (which one would think had been gorged ſufficiently) by variety and ſeaſoning; and to quicken them to an alertneſs in new murders and maſſacres, if it ſhould ſuit the purpoſe of the Guiſes of the day. An aſſembly, in which fat a multitude of prieſts and prelates, was obliged to ſuffer this indignity at its door. The author was not ſent to the gallies, nor the players to the houſe of correction. Not long after this exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, thoſe players came forward to the aſſembly to claim the rites of that very religion which they had dared to expoſe, and to ſhew their proſtituted faces in the ſenate, whilſt the archbiſhop of Paris, whoſe function was known to his people only by his prayers and benedictions, and his wealth only by his alms, is forced to abandon his houſe, and to fly from his flock (as from ravenous wolves) becauſe, truly, in the ſixteenth century, the cardinal of Lorraine was a rebel and a murderer.</p>
            <p>Such is the effect of the perverſion of hiſtory, by thoſe, who, for the ſame nefarious purpoſes, have perverted every other part of learning. But thoſe who will ſtand upon that elevation of reaſon, which places centuries under our eye, and brings things to the true point of compariſon, which obſcures little names, and effaces the colours of little parties, and to which nothing can aſcend but the ſpirit and moral quality of human actions, will ſay to the teachers of the Palais Royal,—the cardinal of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine was the murderer of the ſixteenth century, you have the glory of being the murderers in the eighteenth; and this is the only difference between you. But hiſtory, in the nineteenth century, better underſtood, and better employed, will, I truſt, teach a civilized

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0244800201:252"/>
mind of man poſſeſſes a ſort of creative power of its own; either in repreſenting at pleaſure the images of things in the order and manner in which they were received by the ſenſes, or in combining thoſe images in a new manner, and according to a different order. This power is called imagination; and to this belongs whatever is called wit, fancy, invention, and the like. But it muſt be obſerved, that the power of the imagination is incapable of producing any thing abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely new; it can only vary the diſpoſition of thoſe ideas which it has received from the ſenſes. Now the imagination is the moſt extenſive province of pleaſure and pain, as it is the region of our fears and our hopes, and of all our paſſions that are connected with them; and whatever is calculated to affect the imagination with theſe commanding ideas, by force of any original natural impreſſion, muſt have the ſame power pretty equally over all men. For ſince the imagination is only the repreſentation of the ſenſes, it can only be pleaſed or diſpleaſed with the images, from the ſame principle on which the ſenſe is pleaſed or diſpleaſed with the realities; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there muſt be juſt as cloſe an agreement in the imaginations as in the ſenſes of men.

            <head>INDIA COMPANY. Conduct to the Polygars, or native Princes of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natic. (See CARNATIC.)</head>
            <p>IT is only to complete the view I propoſed of the conduct of the company, with regard to the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent provinces, that I ſhall ſay <hi>any</hi> thing at all of the Carnatic, which is the ſcene, if poſſible, of greater diſorder than the northern provinces. Perhaps it were better to ſay of this center and metropolis of abuſe, whence all the reſt in India and in England diverge; from whence they are ſed and methodized, what was ſaid of Carthage—<hi>de Carthagine ſatius eſt ſilere quam parum dicere.</hi> This country, in all its denominations, is about 46,000 ſquare miles. It may be affirmed univerſally, that not one perſon of ſubſtance or property, landed, commercial, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, excepting two or three bankers, who are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary depoſits and diſtributors of the general ſpoil, is left in all that region. In that country the moiſture, the bounty of Heaven, is given but at a certain ſeaſon. Before the aera of our influence, the induſtry of man carefully huſbanded that gift of God. The Gentûs preſerved, with a provident and religious care, the precious depoſit of the periodical rain in reſervoirs, many of them works of royal grandeur; and from theſe, as occaſion demanded, they fructified the whole country. To maintain theſe reſervoirs, and to keep up an annual advance to the cultivators, for ſeed and cattle, formed a principal object of the piety and policy of the prieſts and rulers of the Gentû religion.</p>
            <p>This object required a command of money; and there was no pollam, or caſtle, which in the happy days of the Carnatic was without ſome hoard of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by which the governors were enabled to combat with the irregularity of the ſeaſons, and to reſiſt or to buy off the invaſion of an enemy. In all the cities were multitudes of merchants and bankers, for all occaſions of monied aſſiſtance; and on the other hand, the native princes were in condition to obtain
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0244800201:254"/>
credit from them. The manufacturer was paid by the return of commodities, or by imported money, and not, as at preſent, in the taxes that had been originally exacted from his induſtry. In aid of caſual diſtreſs, the country was full of choultries, which were inns and hoſpitals, where the traveller and the poor were relieved. All ranks of people had their place in the public concern, and their ſhare in the common ſtock and common proſperity; but <hi>the chartered rights of men,</hi> and the right which it was thought proper to ſet up in the Nabob of Arcot, introduced a new ſyſtem. It was their policy to conſider hoards of money as crimes; to regard mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate rents as frauds on the ſovereign; and to view, in the leſſer princes, any claim of exemption from more than ſettled tribute, as an act of rebellion. Accordingly all the caſtles were, one after the other, plundered and deſtroyed. The native princes were expelled; the hoſpitals fell to ruin; the reſervoirs of water went to decay; the merchants, bankers, and manufacturers diſappeared; and ſterility, indigence, and depopulation, overſpread the face of theſe once flouriſhing provinces.</p>
            <p>The company was very early ſenſible of theſe miſchiefs, and of their true cauſe. They gave preciſe orders,
<q rend="inline">"that the native princes, called polygars, ſhould <hi>not be extirpated.</hi>—That the rebellion [ſo they chooſe to call it] of the polygars, may (they fear) <hi>with too much juſtice,</hi> be attributed to the mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adminiſtration of the Nabob's collectors." That
 "they obſerve with concern, that their troops have been put to <hi>diſagreeable</hi> ſervices."</q>
They might have uſed a ſtronger expreſſion without impropriety. But they make amends in another place. Speaking of the polygars, the directors ſay, that
<q rend="inline">"it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to humanity to <hi>force</hi> them to ſuch dreadful extremeties <hi>as they underwent.</hi>"</q>
That ſome examples of ſeverity <hi>might</hi> be neceſſary,
<q rend="inline">"when they fell into the Nabob's hands,"</q>
               <hi>and not by the deſtruction of the</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0244800201:255"/>
               <hi>country.</hi>
               <q rend="inline">"That <hi>they fear</hi> his government is <hi>none of the mildeſt;</hi> and that there is <hi>great oppreſſion</hi> in collecting his revenues."</q>
They ſtate, that the wars in which he has involved the Carnatic, had been a cauſe of its diſtreſſes.
<q rend="inline">"That theſe diſtreſſes have been certainly great; but thoſe by <hi>the Nabob's op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> we believe <hi>to be greater than all.</hi>"</q>
Pray, Sir, attend to the reaſon for their opinion that the government of this their inſtrument is more calamitous to the country than the ravages of war.—Becauſe, ſay they, his oppreſſions are
<q rend="inline">"<hi>without intermiſſion.</hi>—The others are temporary; by all which <hi>oppreſſions</hi> we believe the Nabob has great wealth in ſtore."</q>
From this ſtore neither he nor they could derive any advantage whatſoever, upon the invaſion of Hyder Ali in the hour of their greateſt calamity and diſmay.</p>
            <p>It is now proper to compare theſe declarations with the company's conduct. The principal reaſon which they aſſigned againſt the <hi>extirpation</hi> of the polygars was, that the <hi>weavers</hi> were protected in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes. They might have added, that the company itſelf, which ſlung them to death, had been warmed in the boſom of theſe unfortunate princes: for, on the taking of Madras by the French, it was in their hoſpitable pollams, that moſt of the inhabitants found refuge and protection. But, notwithſtanding all theſe orders, reaſons, and declarations, they at length gave an indirect ſanction, and permitted the uſe of a very direct and irreſiſtible force, to meaſures which they had, over and over again, declared to be falſe policy, cruel, inhuman, and oppreſſive. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, forgot all attention to the princes and the people, they remembered that they had ſome ſort of intereſt in the trade of the country; and it is matter of curioſity to obſerve the protection which they afforded to this their natural object.</p>
            <p>Full of anxious cares on this head, they direct,
<q rend="inline">"that in reducing the polygars they (their ſervants) were to be <hi>cautious,</hi> not to deprive the <hi>weavers and</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0244800201:256"/>
                  <hi>manufacturers</hi> of the protection they often met with in the ſtrong holds of the polygar countries;"</q>—and they write to their inſtrument, the Nabob of Arcot, concerning theſe poor people in a moſt pathetic ſtrain.
<q rend="inline">"We <hi>entreat</hi> your excellency (ſay they) in particular, to make the manufacturers the object of your <hi>tendereſt care</hi>; particularly when you <hi>root out</hi> the polygars, you do not deprive the <hi>weavers of the protection they enjoyed under them.</hi>"</q>
When they root out the protectors in favour of the oppreſſor, they ſhew themſelves religiouſly cautious of the rights of the protected. When they extirpate the ſhepherd and the ſhepherd's dogs, they piouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the helpleſs flock to the mercy, and even to the <hi>tendereſt care,</hi> of the wolf.—<bibl>

            <head>INDIA PROVINCES (STATE OF). Bengal.</head>
            <p>BENGAL, and the provinces that are united to it, are larger than the kingdom of France; and once contained, as France does contain, a great and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent landed intereſt, compoſed of princes, of great lords, of a numerous nobility and gentry, of freeholders, of lower tenants, of religious commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and public foundations. So early as 1769, the company's ſervants perceived the decay into which theſe provinces had fallen under Engliſh admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and they made a ſtrong repreſentation upon this decay, and what they apprehended to be the cauſes of it. Soon after this repreſentation, Mr. Haſtings became preſident of Bengal. Inſtead of adminiſtering a remedy to this melancholy diſorder, upon the heels of a dreadful famine, in the year 1772, the ſuccour which the new preſident and the council lent to this afflicted nation was—ſhall I be believed in relating it?—the landed intereſt of a whole kingdom, of a kingdom to be compared to France, was ſet up to public auction! They ſet up
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0244800201:257"/>
(Mr. Haſtings ſet up) the whole nobility, gentry, and freeholders, to the higheſt bidder. No preference was given to the ancient proprietors. They muſt bid againſt every uſurer, every temporary adventurer, every jobber and ſchemer, every ſervant of every European, or they were obliged to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in lieu of their extenſive domains, with their houſe, and ſuch a penſion as the ſtate-auctioneers thought fit to aſſign. In this general calamity, ſeveral of the firſt nobility thought (and in all appearance juſtly) that they had better ſubmit to the neceſſity of this penſion, than continue, under the name of ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindars, the objects and inſtruments of a ſyſtem, by which they ruined their tenants, and were ruined themſelves. Another reform has ſince come upon the back of the firſt; and a penſion having been aſſigned to theſe unhappy perſons, in lieu of their hereditary lands, a new ſcheme of oeconomy has taken place, and deprived them of that penſion.</p>

            <p>Such an univerſal proſcription, upon any pretence, has few examples. Such a proſcription, without even a pretence of delinquency, has none. It ſtands by itſelf. It ſtands as a monument to aſtoniſh the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to confound the reaſon of mankind. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to you, when I firſt came to know this buſineſs in its true nature and extent, my ſurpriſe did a little ſuſpend my indignation. I was in a manner ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the deſperate boldneſs of a few obſcure young men, who having obtained, by ways which they could not comprehend, a power of which they ſaw neither the purpoſes nor the limits, toſſed about, ſubverted, and tore to pieces, as if it were in the

gambols of a boyiſh unluckineſs and malice, the moſt eſtabliſhed rights, and the moſt ancient and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered inſtitutions, of ages and nations. Sir, I will not now trouble you with any detail with regard to what they have ſince done with theſe ſame lands and land-holders; only to inform you, that nothing has been ſuffered to ſettle for two ſeaſons together upon any baſis; and that the levity and inconſtancy of theſe mock legiſlators were not the leaſt afflicting parts of the oppreſſions ſuffered under their uſurpation; nor will any thing give ſtability to the property of the natives, but an adminiſtration in England at once protecting and ſtable. The country ſuſtains, almoſt every year, the miſeries of a revolution. At preſent, all is uncertainty, miſery, and confuſion. There is to be found through theſe vaſt regions no longer one landed man, who is a reſource for voluntary aid, or an object for particular rapine. Some of them were, not long ſince, great princes; they poſſeſſed treaſures, they levied armies. There was a zemindar in Bengal (I forget his name) that, on the threat of an invaſion, ſupplied the ſoubah of theſe provinces with the loan of a million ſterling.

But ſince the eſtabliſhment of the Britiſh power, it has waſted away under an uniform gradual decline; inſomuch that in the year 1779 not one merchant of eminence was to be found in the whole country<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Smith's Examination before the ſelect committee, Appendix No. 2.</note>.

            <p>During the deep ſilent flow of this ſteady ſtream of wealth, which ſet from India into Europe, it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally paſſed on with no adequate obſervation; but happening at ſome periods to meet rifts of rocks that checked its courſe, it grew more noiſy, and attracted more notice.

Was it not enough to put theſe gentlemen, in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viciate of their adminiſtration, on their guard, and to call upon them for a ſtrict enquiry (if not to juſtify them in a reprobation of thoſe demands without any enquiry at all) that when all England, Scotland, and Ireland, had for years been witneſs to the immenſe ſums laid out by the ſervants of the company in ſtocks of all denominations, in the purchaſe of lands, in the buying and building of houſes, in the ſecuring quiet ſeats in parliament, or in the tumultuous riot of conteſted elections, in wandering throughout the whole range of thoſe variegated modes of inventive prodigality; which ſometimes have excited our won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſometimes rouſed our indignation; that after all India was four millions ſtill in debt to <hi>them?</hi> India in debt to <hi>them!</hi> For what?

A debt of millions, in favour of a ſet of men, whoſe names, with few exceptions, are either buried in the obſcurity of their origin and talents, or dragged into light by the enormity of their crimes?</p>
            <p>In my opinion the courage of the miniſter was the moſt wonderful part of the tranſaction, eſpecially as he muſt have read, or rather the right honourable gentleman ſays, he has read for him, whole volumes upon the ſubject. The volumes, by the way, are not by one tenth part ſo numerous as the right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable gentleman has thought proper to pretend, in order to frighten you from enquiry; but in theſe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, ſuch as they are, the miniſter muſt have found a full authority for a ſuſpicion (at the very leaſt) of every thing relative to the great fortunes made at Madras. What is that authority? Why no other than the ſtanding authority for all the claims which the miniſtry has thought fit to provide for—the grand debtor—the nabob of Arcot himſelf. Hear that prince, in the letter written to the court of directors, at the preciſe period, whilſt the main body of theſe debts were contracting. In this letter he ſtates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be, what undoubtedly he is, a moſt compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent witneſs to this point. After ſpeaking of the war with Hyder Ali in 1768 and 1769, and of other meaſures which he cenſures (whether right or wrong it ſignifies nothing) and into which he ſays he had been led by the company's ſervants; he proceeds in this

manner—
<q rend="inline">"If all theſe things were againſt the real intereſts of the company, they are ten thouſand times more againſt mine, and againſt the proſperity of my country, and the happineſs of my people; for your intereſts and mine are the ſame. <hi>What were they owing to then? to the private views of a few individuals, who have enriched themſelves at the expence of your influence, and of my country; for your ſervants HAVE NO TRADE IN THIS COUNTRY; neither do you pay them high wages; yet in a few years they return to England, with many lacks of pogodas. How can you or I account for ſuch immenſe fortunes, acquired in ſo ſhort a time, without any viſible means of getting them?</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>When he aſked this queſtion, which involves its anſwer, it is extraordinary that curioſity did not prompt the chancellor of the exchequer to that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry which might come in vain recommended to him by his own act of parliament. Does not the nabob of Arcot tell us in ſo many words, that there was no fair way of making the enormous ſums ſent by the company's ſervants to England? And do you imagine that there was or could be more honeſty and good faith in the demands, for what remained behind in India? Of what nature were the tranſactions with himſelf? If you follow the train of his information you muſt ſee, that if theſe great ſums were at all lent, it was not property, but ſpoil that was lent; if not lent, the tranſaction was not a contract, but a fraud. Either way, if light enough could not be furniſhed to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe a full condemnation of theſe demands, they ought to have been left to the parties who beſt knew and underſtood each others proceedings. It was not neceſſary that the authority of government ſhould interpoſe in favour of claims, whoſe very foundation was a defiance of that authority, and whoſe object and end was its entire ſubverſion.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid that this letter was written by the nabob of Arcot in a moody humour, under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0244800201:264"/>
of ſome chagrin. Certainly it was; but it is in ſuch humours that truth comes out. And when he tells you from his own knowledge, what every one muſt preſume, from the extreme probability of the thing, whether he told it or not, one ſuch teſtimony is worth a thouſand that contradict that probability, when the parties have a better underſtanding with each other, and when they have a point to carry, that may unite them in a common deceit.</p>
            <p>If this body of private claims of debt, real or deviſed, were a queſtion, as it is falſely pretended, between the nabob of Arcot as debtor, and Paul Benfield and his aſſociates as creditors, I am ſure I ſhould give myſelf but little trouble about it. If the hoards of oppreſſion were the fund for ſatisfying the claims of bribery and peculation, who would wiſh to interfere between ſuch litigants? If the demands were confined to what might be drawn from the treaſures which the company's records uniformly aſſert that the nabob is in poſſeſſion of; or if he had mines of gold or ſilver, or diamonds (as we know that he has none) theſe gentlemen might break open his hoards, or dig in his mines, without any diſturbance from me. But the gentlemen on the other ſide of the houſe know as well as I do, and they dare not contradict me, that the nabob of Arcot and his creditors are not adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, but colluſive parties, and that the whole tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action is under a falſe colour, and falſe names. The litigation is not, nor ever has been, between their rapacity and his hoarded riches. No; it is between him and them combining and confederating on one ſide, and the public revenues, and the miſerable inhabitants of a ruined country, on the other. Theſe are the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Refuſing a ſhilling from his hoards for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of any demand, the nabob of Arcot is always ready, nay, he earneſtly, and with eagerneſs and paſſion, contends for delivering up to theſe pretended creditors his territory and his ſubjects. It is therefore

not from treaſuries and mines, but from the food of your unpaid armies, from the blood withheld from the veins, and whipt out of the backs of the moſt miſerable of men, that we are to pamper extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, uſury, and peculation, under the falſe names of debtors and creditors of ſtate.—<bibl>

            <p>WORSE, far worſe, has been the fate of the poor creatures, the natives of India, whom the hypocriſy of the company has betrayed into complaint of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and diſcovery of peculation. The firſt woman in Bengal, the ranni of Rajeſhahi, the ranni of Burdwan, the ranni of Amboa, by their weak and thoughtleſs truſt in the company's honour and protection, are utterly ruined: the firſt of theſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, a perſon of princely rank, and once of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent fortune, who paid above two hundred thouſand a year quit-rent to the ſtate, is, according to very credible information, ſo completely beggared as to ſtand in need of the relief of alms. Mahomed Reza Khân, the ſecond Muſſulman in Bengal, for having been diſtinguiſhed by the ill-omened honour of the countenance and protection of the court of directors, was, without the pretence of any enquiry whatſoever into his conduct, ſtripped of all his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and reduced to the loweſt condition.

            <p>IN the northern parts it is a ſolid maſs of land, about eight hundred miles in length, and four or five hundred broad. As you go ſouthward, it becomes narrower for a ſpace. It afterwards dilates; but narrower or broader, you poſſeſs the whole eaſtern and north-eaſtern coaſt of that vaſt country, quite from the borders of Pegu.—Bengal, Bahar, and Oriſſa, with Benares (now unfortunately in our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate poſſeſſion) meaſure 161,978 ſquare Engliſh miles; a territory conſiderably larger than the whole kingdom of France. Oude, with its dependant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, is 53,286 ſquare miles, not a great deal leſs than England. The Carnatic, with Tanjour and the Circars, is 65,948 ſquare miles, very conſiderably larger than England; and the whole of the company's dominions, comprehending Bombay and Salſette, amounts to 281,412 ſquare miles; which forms a territory larger than any European dominion, Ruſſia and Turkey excepted. Through all that vaſt extent of country there is not a man who eats a mouthful of rice but by permiſſion of the Eaſt India company.—So far with regard to the extent. The population of this great empire is not eaſy to be calculated. When the countries, of which it is compoſed, came into our poſſeſſion, they were all eminently peopled, and eminently productive; though at that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably declined from their antient proſperity. But ſince they are come into our hands!—! How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if we take the period of our eſtimate immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0244800201:268"/>
before the utter deſolation of the Carnatic, and if we allow for the havoc which our government had even then made in theſe regions, we cannot, in my opinion, rate the population at much leſs than thirty millions of ſouls; more than four times the number of perſons in the iſland of Great Britain.</p>
            <p>My next enquiry to that of the number, is the quality and deſcription of the inhabitants. This mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men does not conſiſt of an abject and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous populace; much leſs of gangs of ſavages, like the Guaranies and Chiquitos, who wander on the waſte borders of the river of Amazons, or the Plate; but a people for ages civilized and cultivated; culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by all the arts of poliſhed life, whilſt we were yet in the woods. There, have been (and ſtill the ſkeletons remain) princes once of great dignity, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and opulence. There, are to be found the chiefs of tribes and nations. There, is to be found an antient and venerable prieſthood, the depoſitory of their laws, learning, and hiſtory, the guides of the people whilſt living, and their conſolation in death; a nobility of great antiquity and renown; a multitude of cities, not exceeded in population and trade by thoſe of the firſt claſs in Europe; merchants and bankers, individual houſes of whom have once vied in capital with the Bank of England; whoſe credit had often ſupported a tottering ſtate, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their governments in the midſt of war and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; millions of ingenious manufacturers and mechanics; millions of the moſt diligent, and not the leaſt intelligent, tillers of the earth. Here are to be found almoſt all the religions profeſſed by men, the Bramincal, the Muſſulmen, the Eaſtern and the Weſtern Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>If I were to take the whole aggregate of our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions there, I ſhould compare it, as the neareſt parallel I can find, with the empire of Germany. Our immediate poſſeſſions I ſhould compare with the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0244800201:269"/>
Auſtrian dominions, and they would not ſuffer in the compariſon. The nabob of Oude might ſtand for the king of Pruſſia; the nabob of Arcot I would compare, as ſuperior in territory, and equal in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, to the elector of Saxony. Cheyt Sing, the rajah of Benares, might well rank with the prince of Heſſe, at leaſt; and the rajah of Tanjore (though hardly equal in extent of dominion, ſuperior in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue) to the elector of Bavaria. The Polygars and the northern Zemindars, and other great chiefs, might well claſs with the reſt of the princes, dukes, counts, marquiſſes, and biſhops in the empire; all of whom I mention to honour, and ſurely without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to any or all of thoſe moſt reſpectable princes and grandees.</p>
            <p>All this vaſt maſs, compoſed of ſo many orders and claſſes of men, is again infinitely diverſified by manners, by religion, by hereditary employment, through all their poſſible combinations. This ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the handling of India a matter in an high degree critical and delicate. But oh! it has been handled rudely indeed. Even ſome of the reformers ſeem to have forgot that they had any thing to do but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the tenants of a manor, or the ſhopkeepers of the next county town.</p>
            <p>It is an empire of this extent, of this complicated nature, of this dignity and importance, that I have compared to Germany, and the German government; not for an exact reſemblance, but as a ſort of a middle term, by which India might be approximated to our underſtandings, and if poſſible to our feelings; in order to awaken ſomething of ſympathy for the unfortunate natives, of which I am afraid we are not perfectly ſuſceptible, whilſt we look at this very remote object through a falſe and cloudy medium.—<bibl>

Of what value is that, whether it riſe to ten, or fall to ſix, or to nothing, to him whoſe ſon, before he is in Bengal two months, and before he deſcends the ſteps of the council chamber, ſells the grant of a ſingle contract for forty thouſand pounds?

            <p>IT cannot be concealed. We are a divided people. But in diviſions, where a part is to be taken, we are to make a muſter of our ſtrength. I have often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to claſs thoſe who, in any political view, are to be called the people. Without doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this ſort we muſt proceed abſurdly. We ſhould preſume as abſurdly, if we pretended to very great accuracy in our eſtimate. But I think, in the calculation I have made, the error cannot be very material. In England and Scotland, I compute that thoſe of adult age, not declining in life, of tolerable leiſure for ſuch diſcuſſions, and of ſome means of information, more or leſs, and who are above menial dependence, (or what virtually is ſuch) may amount
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0244800201:272"/>
to about four hundred thouſand. In this number I include the women that take a concern in thoſe tranſactions, who cannot exceed twenty thouſand. There is ſuch a thing as a natural repreſentative of the people. This body is that repreſentative; and on this body, more than on the legal conſtituent, the artificial repreſentative depends. This is the Britiſh public, and it is a public very numerous. The reſt, when feeble, are the objects of protection; when ſtrong, the means of force. They who affect to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that part of us in any other light, inſult while they cajole us; they do not want us for counſellors in deliberation, but to liſt us as ſoldiers for battle.</p>
            <p>Of theſe four hundred thouſand political citizens, I look upon one fifth, or about eighty thouſand, to be pure Jacobins, utterly incapable of amendment; objects of eternal vigilance; and when they break out, of legal conſtraint. On theſe, no reaſon, no argument, no example, no venerable authority, can have the ſlighteſt influence. They deſire a change, and they will have it if they can. If they cannot have it by Engliſh cabal, they will make no ſort of ſcruple of having it by the cabal of France, into which already they are virtually incorporated.</p>
            <p>This minority is great and formidable. I do not know whether if I aimed at the total overthrow of a kingdom, I ſhould wiſh to be encumbered with a larger body of partizans. Theſe, by their ſpirit of intrigue, and by their reſtleſs agitating activity, are of a force far ſuperior to their numbers; and if times grew the leaſt critical, have the means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching or intimidating many of thoſe who are now ſound, as well as of adding to their force large bodies of the more paſſive part of the nation. This mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is numerous enough to make a mighty cry for peace, or for war, or for any object they are led ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently to deſire. By paſſing from place to place with a velocity incredible, and diverſifying their character and deſcription, they are capable of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micking
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0244800201:273"/>
the general voice. We muſt not always judge of the generality of the opinion by the noiſe of the acclamation.</p>
            <p>The majority, the other four-fifths, is perfectly ſound, and of the beſt poſſible diſpoſitions to religion, to government, to the true and undivided intereſt of their country. Such men are naturally diſpoſed to peace. They who are in poſſeſſion of all they wiſh, are languid and improvident. With this fault, (and I admit its exiſtence in all its extent) they would not endure to hear of a peace that led to the ruin of every thing for which peace is dear to them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the deſire of peace is eſſentially the weak ſide of all ſuch men. All men that are ruined, are ruined on the ſide of their natural propenſities. There they are unguarded. They do not ſuſpect that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is attempted through their virtues. This their enemies are perfectly aware of, and accordingly they, the moſt turbulent of mankind, who never made a ſcruple to ſhake the tranquillity of their country to its centre, raiſe a continual cry for peace with France. Peace with regicides, and war with the reſt of the world, is their true motto. From the beginning, and even whilſt the French gave the blows, and we hardly oppoſed the <hi>vis inertiae</hi> to their efforts, from that day to this hour, like importunate Guinea-fowls crying one note day and night, they have called Peace, peace!!—<bibl>

yet a good judgment does not neceſſarily ariſe from a quick ſenſibility of pleaſure; it frequently happens that a very poor judge, merely by force of a greater complexional ſenſibility, is more affected by a very poor piece, than the beſt judge by the moſt perfect; for as every thing new, extraordinary, grand, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, is well calculated to affect ſuch a perſon, and that the faults do not affect him, his pleaſure is more pure and unmixed; and as it is merely a pleaſure of the imagination, it is much higher than any which is derived from a rectitude of the judgment; the judgment is for the greater part employed in throwing ſtumbling-blocks in the way of the imagination, in diſſipating the ſcenes of its enchantment, and in tying us down to the diſagreeable yoke of our reaſon; for almoſt the only pleaſure that men have in judging better than others, conſiſts in a ſort of conſcious pride and ſuperiority, which ariſes from thinking rightly; but then, this is an indirect pleaſure, a pleaſure which does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſult from the object which is under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. In the morning of our days, when the ſenſes are unworn and tender, when the whole man is awake in every part, and the gloſs of novelty freſh upon all the objects that ſurround us, how lively at that time are our ſenſations, but how falſe and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate the judgments we form of things? I deſpair of ever receiving the ſame degree of pleaſure from the moſt excellent performances of genius which I felt at that age, from pieces which my preſent judgment regards as trifling and contemptible. Every trivial cauſe of pleaſure is apt to affect the man of too ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine a complexion: his appetite is too keen to ſuffer his taſte to be delicate; and he is in all reſpects what Ovid ſays of himſelf in love,

whether, becauſe wicked men of <hi>various</hi> deſcriptions are engaged in ſeditious courſes, the rational, ſober, and valuable part of <hi>one</hi> deſcription ſhould not be indulged in their ſober and rational expectations? You, who have looked deeply into the ſpirit of the popery laws, muſt be perfectly ſenſible, that a great part of the preſent miſchief, which we abhor in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, if it at all exiſts, has ariſen from them. Their declared object was to reduce the Catholics of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to a miſerable populace, without property, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eſtimation, without education. The profeſſed object was to deprive the few men who, in ſpite of thoſe laws, might hold or obtain any property amongſt them, of all ſort of influence or authority over the reſt. They divided the nation into two diſtinct bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, without common intereſt, ſympathy, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection.

Are we to be aſtoniſhed, when, by the efforts of ſo much violence in conqueſt, and ſo much policy in regulation, continued without intermiſſion for near an hundred years, we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to a mob; that whenever they came to act at all, many of them would act exactly like a mob, without temper, meaſure, or foreſight?

It will deſerve your beſt thoughts, to examine whether this can be done without giving ſuch perſons the means of demonſtrating to the reſt, that ſomething more is to be got by their temperate conduct, than can be expected from the wild and ſenſeleſs projects of thoſe who do not belong to their body, who have no intereſt in their well being, and

The ſtigma and reproach, the hideous maſk will be taken off, and men will ſee each other as they are. Sure I am, that there have been thouſands in Ireland, who have never converſed with a Roman Catholic in their whole lives, unleſs they happened to talk to their gardener's workmen, or to aſk their way, when they had loſt it in their ſports; or, at beſt, who had known them only as footmen, or other domeſtics of the ſecond and third order: and ſo averſe were they, ſome time ago, to have them near their perſons, that they would not employ even thoſe who could never find their way beyond the ſtable.

            <p>SO far as to England. In Ireland you have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran us. Without waiting for an Engliſh example, you have totally, and without any modification what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, repealed the teſt as to Proteſtant Diſſenters. Not having the repealing act by me, I ought not to ſay poſitively that there is no exception in it; but if it be what I ſuppoſe it is, you know very well, that a Jew in religion, or a Mahometan, or even <hi>a public, declared atheiſt,</hi> and blaſphemer, is perfectly qualified to be lord lieutenant, a lord juſtice, or even keeper of the king's conſcience; and by virtue of his office (if with you it be as it is with us) adminiſtrator to a great part of the eccleſiaſtical patronage of the crown.</p>
            <p>Now let us deal a little fairly. We muſt admit, that Proteſtant diſſent was one of the quarters from which danger was apprehended at the revolution, and againſt which a part of the coronation oath was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly directed. By this unqualified repeal, you certainly did not mean to deny that it was the duty of the crown to preſerve the church againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters; or taking this to be the true ſenſe of the two revolution acts of king William, and of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0244800201:284"/>
and ſubſequent union acts of queen Anne, you did not declare by this moſt unqualified repeal, by which you broke down all the barriers, not invented, indeed, but carefully preſerved at the revolution; you did not then and by that proceeding declare, that you had adviſed the king to perjury towards God, and perſidy towards the church. No! far, very far from it! you never would have done it, if you did not think it could be done with perfect repoſe to the royal conſcience, and perfect ſafety to the national eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed religion. You did this upon a full conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the circumſtances of your country. Now, if circumſtances required it, why ſhould it be contrary to the king's oath, his parliament judging on thoſe circumſtances, to reſtore to his Catholic people, in ſuch meaſure, and with ſuch modifications as the public wiſdom ſhall think proper to add, <hi>ſome part</hi> in theſe franchiſes which they formerly had held without any limitation at all, and which, upon no ſort of ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reaſon at the time, they were deprived of? If ſuch means can with any probability be ſhown, from cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, rather to add ſtrength to our mixed eccleſiaſtical and ſecular conſtitution than to weaken it; ſurely they are means infinitely to be preferred to penalties, incapacities, and proſcriptions continued from generation to generation. They are perfectly conſiſtent with the other parts of the coronation oath, in which the king ſwears to maintain
<q rend="inline">"the laws of God and the true profeſſion of the goſpel, and to govern the people according to the ſtatutes in Parliament agreed upon, and the laws and cuſtoms of the realm."</q>
In conſenting to ſuch a ſtatute, the crown would act, at leaſt, as agreeable to the laws of God, and to the true profeſſion of the goſpel, and to the laws and cuſtoms of the kingdom, as George I. did when he paſſed the ſtatute which took from the body of the people, every thing which, to that hour, and even after the monſtrous acts of the 2d and 8th of Anne (the objects of our common hatred) they ſtill enjoyed inviolate.—<bibl>

            <p>There is a great reſemblance between the whole frame and conſtitution of the Greek and Latin churches. The ſecular clergy in the former, by being married, living under little reſtraint, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no particular education ſuited to their function, are univerſally fallen into ſuch contempt, that they are never permitted to aſpire to the dignities of their own church. It is not held reſpectful to call them <hi>papas,</hi> their true and antient appellation, but thoſe who wiſh to addreſs them with civility, always call them <hi>hieromonachi.</hi> In conſequence of this diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which I venture to ſay, in ſuch a church, muſt be the conſequence of a ſecular life, a very great
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0244800201:286"/>
degeneracy from reputable chriſtian manners has taken place throughout almoſt the whole of that great member of the chriſtian church.</p>
            <p>It was ſo with the Latin church, before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint on marriage. Even that reſtraint gave riſe to the greateſt diſorders before the council of Trent, which together with the emulation raiſed, and the good examples given by the reformed churches, wherever they were in view of each other, has brought on that happy amendment, which we ſee in the Latin communion, both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>The council of Trent has wiſely introduced the diſcipline of ſeminaries, by which prieſts are not truſted for a clerical inſtitution, even to the ſevere diſcipline of their colleges; but after they paſs through them, are frequently, if not for the greater part, obliged to paſs through peculiar methods, having their particular ritual function in view. It is in a great meaſure to this, and to ſimilar methods uſed in foreign education, that the Roman Catholic clergy of Ireland, miſerably provided for, living among low and ill-regulated people, without any diſcipline of ſufficient force to ſecure good manners, have been prevented from becoming an intolerable nuiſance to the country, inſtead of being, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they generally are, a very great ſervice to it.—<bibl>

            <head>IRELAND. Genius and Policy of the Engliſh Government in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; Revolution, &amp;c. (See IRISH CATHOLICS.)</head>
            <p>I CANNOT poſſibly confound in my mind all the things which were done at the revolution, with the <hi>principles</hi> of the revolution. As in moſt great changes, many things were done from the neceſſities of the time, well or ill underſtood from paſſion or
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0244800201:287"/>
from vengeance, which were not only not perfectly agreeable to its principles, but in the moſt direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to them. I ſhall not think that the <hi>depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſome millions of people of all the rights of citizens, and all intereſt in the conſtitution, in and to which they were born,</hi> was a thing conformable to the <hi>declared principles</hi> of the revolution. This, I am ſure, is true relatively to England (where the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe <hi>anti-principles</hi> comparatively were of little extent) and ſome of our late laws, in repealing acts made immediately after the revolution, admit that ſome things then done were not done in the true ſpirit of the revolution. But the revolution operated differently in England and Irelend, in many, and theſe eſſential particulars. Suppoſing the principles to have been altogether the ſame in both kingdoms, by the application of thoſe principles to very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent objects, the whole ſpirit of the ſyſtem was changed, not to ſay reverſed. In England it was the ſtruggle of the <hi>great body</hi> of the people for the eſtabliſhment of their liberties, againſt the efforts of a very <hi>ſmall faction,</hi> who would have oppreſſed them. In Ireland it was the eſtabliſhment of the power of the ſmaller number, at the expence of the civil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and properties of the far greater part; and at the expence of the political liberties of the whole. It was, to ſay the truth, not a revolution, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; which is not to ſay a great deal in its favour. To inſiſt on every thing done in Ireland at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, would be to inſiſt on the ſevere and jealous policy of a conqueror, in the crude ſettlement of his new acquiſition, as a <hi>permanent</hi> rule for its future government. This, no power, in no country that ever I heard of, has done or profeſſed to do—ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Ireland; where it is done, and poſſibly by ſome people will be profeſſed. Time has, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, in all other places and periods, blended and coalited the conquered with the conquerors. So,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0244800201:288"/>
after ſome time, and after one of the moſt rigid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts that we read of in hiſtory, the Normans ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened into the Engliſh. I wiſh you to turn your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection to the fine ſpeech of Cerealis to the Gauls, made to diſſuade them from revolt. Speaking of the Romans,—
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Nos</hi> quamvis toties laceſſiti, jure victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae id ſolum vobis addidimus, quo pacem tuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur; nam neque quies gentium ſine armis; neque arma ſine ſtipendiis; neque ſtipendia ſine tributis, haberi queant. <hi>Coetera in communi ſita ſunt</hi>: ipſi plerumque noſtris exercitibus <hi>proeſidetis:</hi> ipſi has aliaſque provincias <hi>regitis: nil ſeperatum clauſumve</hi>—Proinde pacem et urbem, quam <hi>victores victique eodem jure obtinemus,</hi> amate, colite."</q>
You will conſider, whether the arguments uſed by that Roman to theſe Gauls, would apply to the caſe in Ireland; and whether you could uſe ſo plauſible a preamble to any ſevere warning you might think it proper to hold out to thoſe who ſhould reſort to ſedition inſtead of ſupplication, to obtain any object that they may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue with the governing power.</p>
            <p>For a much longer period than that which had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to blend the Romans with the nation to which of all others they were the moſt adverſe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſettled in Ireland, conſidered themſelves in no other light than that of a ſort of colonial garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to keep the natives in ſubjection to the other ſtate of Great Britain. The whole ſpirit of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in Ireland, was that of not the mildeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. In truth, the ſpirit of thoſe proceedings did not commence at that aera, nor was religion, of any kind, their primary object. What was done, was not in the ſpirit of a conteſt between two religious factions; but between two adverſe nations. The ſtatutes of Kilkenny ſhew, that the ſpirit of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery laws, and ſome even of their actual proviſions, as applied between Engliſhry and Iriſhry, had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted in that haraſſed country before the words Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0244800201:289"/>
and Papiſt were heard of in the world. If we read baron Finglas, Spenſer, and Sir John Davis, we cannot miſs the true genius and policy of the Engliſh government there before the revolution, as well as during the whole reign of queen Elizabeth. Sir John Davis boaſts of the benefits received by the natives, by extending to them the Engliſh law, and turning the whole kingdom into ſhire ground. But the appearance of things alone was changed. The original ſcheme was never deviated from for a ſingle hour. Unheard-of confiſcations were made in the northern parts, upon grounds of plots and conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, never proved upon their ſuppoſed authors. The war of chicane ſucceeded to the war of arms and of hoſtile ſtatutes; and a regular ſeries of operations were carried on, particularly from Chicheſter's time, in the ordinary courts of juſtice, and by ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and inquiſitions; firſt, under pretence of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, and then of titles in the crown, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the total extirpation of the intereſt of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in their own ſoil—until this ſpecies of ſubtle ravage, being carried to the laſt exceſs of oppreſſion and inſolence under Lord Strafford, it kindled the flames of that rebellion which broke out in 1641. By the iſſue of that war, by the turn which the Earl of Clarendon gave to things at the reſtoration, and by the total reduction of the kingdom of Ireland in 1691, the ruin of the native Iriſh, and in a great meaſure too, of the firſt races of the Engliſh, was completely accompliſhed. The new Engliſh intereſt was ſettled with as ſolid a ſtability as any thing in human affairs can look for. All the penal laws of that unparalleled code of oppreſſion, which were made after the laſt event, were manifeſtly the effects of national hatred and ſcorn towards a conquered people; whom the victors delighted to trample upon, and were not at all afraid to provoke. They were not the effect of their fears but of their ſecurity.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0244800201:290"/>
They who carried on this ſyſtem, looked to the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible force of Great Britain for their ſupport in their acts of power. They were quite certain, that no complaints of the natives would be heard on this ſide of the water, with any other ſentiments than thoſe of contempt and indignation. Their cries ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to augment their torture. Machines, which could anſwer their purpoſes ſo well, muſt be of an excellent contrivance. Indeed, in England, the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble name of the complainants, Iriſh and Papiſts (it would be hard to ſay, ſingly, which ſingly was the moſt odious) ſhut up the hearts of every one againſt them. Whilſt that temper prevailed, and it prevailed in all its force to a time within our memory, every meaſure was pleaſing and popular, juſt in proportion as it tended to haraſs and ruin a ſet of people, who were looked upon as enemies to God and man; and, indeed, as a race of bigotted ſavages, who were a diſgrace to human nature itſelf.</p>
            <p>However, as the Engliſh in Ireland began to be domiciliated, they began alſo to recollect that they had a country. The <hi>Engliſh intereſt,</hi> at firſt by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aint and almoſt inſenſible degrees, but at length openly and avowedly, became an <hi>independent Iriſh intereſt;</hi> full as independent as it could ever have been, if it had continued in the perſons of the native Iriſh; and it was maintained with more ſkill, and more conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency than probably it would have been in theirs. With their views, the <hi>Anglo-Iriſh</hi> changed their maxims—it was neceſſary to demonſtrate to the whole people that there was ſomething at leaſt, of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt, combined with the independency, which was to become the object of common exertions. The mildneſs of government produced the firſt relaxation towards the Iriſh; the neceſſities, and, in part too, the temper that predominated at this great change, produced the ſecond and the moſt important of theſe relaxations. Engliſh government, and Iriſh legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0244800201:291"/>
felt jointly the propriety of this meaſure. The Iriſh parliament and nation became independent.</p>
            <p>The true revolution to you, that which moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſically and ſubſtantially reſembled the Engliſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of 1688, was the Iriſh revolution of 1782. The Iriſh parliament of 1782 bore little reſemblance to that which ſat in that kingdom, after the period of the firſt of theſe revolutions. It bore a much nearer reſemblance to that which ſat under king James. The change of the parliament in 1782 from the character of the parliament which, as a token of its indignation, had burned all the journals indiſcriminately of the former parliament in the council chamber, was very viſible. The addreſs of king William's parliament, the parliament which aſſembled after the revolution, amongſt other cauſes of complaint (many of them ſufficiently juſt) complains of the repeal by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors of Poyning's law; no abſolute idol with the parliament of 1782.</p>
            <p>Great Britain finding the Anglo-Iriſh highly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with a ſpirit, which had, indeed, ſhewn itſelf before, though with little energy, and many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and therefore ſuffered a multitude of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form precedents to be eſtabliſhed againſt it, acted, in my opinion, with the greateſt temperance and wiſdom. She ſaw that the diſpoſition of the <hi>leading part</hi> of the nation would not permit them to act any longer the part of a <hi>garriſon.</hi> She ſaw that true policy did not require that they ever ſhould have appeared in that character; or if it had done ſo formerly, the reaſons had now ceaſed to operate. She ſaw that the Iriſh of her race, were reſolved to build their conſtitution and their polites upon another bottom. With thoſe things under her view, ſhe inſtantly complied with the whole of your demands, without any reſervation whatſoever. She ſurrendered that boundleſs ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, for the preſervation of which, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, ſhe had ſupported the Engliſh colonies in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0244800201:292"/>
Ireland for ſo long a time, and at ſo vaſt an expence (according to the ſtandard of thoſe ages) of her blood and treaſure.</p>
            <p>When we bring before us the matter which hiſtory affords for our ſelection, it is not improper to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſpirit of the ſeveral precedents, which are candidates for our choice. Might it not be as well for your ſtateſmen, on the other ſide of the water, to take an example from this latter, and ſurely more conciliatory revolution, as a pattern for your conduct towards your own fellow-citizens, than from that of 1688, when a paramount ſovereignty over both you and them, was more loftily claimed, and more ſternly exerted, than at any former, or at any ſubſequent period? Great Britain in 1782, roſe above the vulgar ideas of policy, the ordinary jealouſies of ſtate, and all the ſentiments of national pride and national am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. If ſhe had been more diſpoſed than, I thank God for it, ſhe was, to liſten to the ſuggeſtions of paſſion, than to the dictates of prudence; ſhe might have urged the principles, the maxims, the policy, the practice of the revolution, againſt the demands of the leading deſcription in Ireland, with full as much plauſibility, and full as good a grace, as any amongſt them can poſſibly do, againſt the ſupplications of ſo vaſt and extenſive a deſcription of their own people.</p>
            <p>A good deal too, if the ſpirit of domination and excluſion had prevailed in England, might have been excepted againſt ſome of the means then employed in Ireland, whilſt her claims were in agitation. They were, at leaſt, as much out of the ordinary courſe, as thoſe which are now objected againſt admitting your people to any of the benefits of an Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Moſt certainly, neither with you, nor here, was any one ignorant of what was at that time ſaid, written, and done. But on all ſides we ſeparated the means from the end; and we ſeparated the cauſe of the moderate and rational, from the ill-intentioned
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0244800201:293"/>
and ſeditious; which on ſuch occaſions are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently apt to march together. At that time, on your part, you were not afraid to review what was done at the revolution of 1688, and what had been continued during the ſubſequent flouriſhing period of the Britiſh empire. The change then made was a great and fundamental alteration. In the execution, it was an operoſe buſineſs on both ſides of the water. It required the repeal of ſeveral laws; the modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of many, and a new courſe to be given to an infinite number of legiſlative, judicial, and official practices and uſages in both kingdoms. This did not frighten any of us. You are now aſked to give, in ſome moderate meaſure, to your fellow-citizens, what Great Britain gave to you, without any meaſure at all. Yet notwithſtanding all the difficulties at the time, and the apprehenſions which ſome very well-meaning people entertained, through the admirable temper in which this revolution (or reſtoration in the nature of a revolution) was conducted in both king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, it has hitherto produced no inconvenience to either; and I truſt, with the continuance of the ſame temper, that it never will. I think that this ſmall inconſiderable change relative to an excluſive ſtatute not made at the revolution, for reſtoring the people to the benefits, from which the green ſoreneſs of a civil war had not excluded them, will be productive of no ſort of miſchief whatſoever. Compare what was done in 1782 with what is wiſhed in 1792; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſpirit of what has been done at the ſeveral periods of reformation; and weigh maturely, whether it be exactly true that conciliatory conceſſions are of good policy only in diſcuſſions between nations; but that among deſcriptions in the ſame nation, they muſt always be irrational and dangerous. What have you ſuffered in your peace, your proſperity, or, in what ought ever to be dear to a nation, your glory, by the laſt act by which you took the property of that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0244800201:294"/>
people under the protection of the <hi>laws?</hi> What reaſon have you to dread the conſequences of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the people poſſeſſing that property to ſome ſhare in the protection of the <hi>conſtitution?—</hi>

            <head>IRELAND. The Engliſh Parliament early communicated to Ireland.</head>
            <p>IRELAND, before the Engliſh conqueſt, though never governed by a deſpotic power, had no parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How far the Engliſh parliament itſelf was at that time modelled according to the preſent form, is diſputed among antiquarians. But we have all the reaſon in the world to be aſſured, that a form of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſuch as England then enjoyed, ſhe inſtantly communicated to Ireland; and we are equally ſure that almoſt every ſucceſſive improvement in conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional liberty, as faſt as it was made here, was tranſmitted thither. The feudal baronage, and the feudal knighthood, the roots of our primitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, were early tranſplanted into that ſoil; and grew and flouriſhed there. Magna Charta, if it did not give us originally the houſe of commons, gave us at leaſt an houſe of commons of weight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. But your anceſtors did not churliſhly ſit down alone to the feaſt of Magna Charta. Ireland was made immediately a partaker. This benefit of Engliſh laws and liberties, I confeſs, was not at firſt extended to <hi>all</hi> Ireland. Mark the conſequence. Engliſh authority and Engliſh liberties had exactly the ſame boundaries. Your ſtandard could never be advanced an inch before your privileges. Sir John Davis ſhews beyond a doubt, that the refuſal of a general communication of theſe rights, was the true cauſe why Ireland was five hundred years in ſubduing; and after the vain projects of a military government, attempted in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, it was
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0244800201:295"/>
ſoon diſcovered, that nothing could make that country Engliſh, in civility and allegiance, but your laws and your forms of legiſlature. It was not Engliſh arms, but the Engliſh conſtitution, that conquered Ireland. From that time, Ireland has ever had a general parliament, as ſhe had before a partial parliament. You changed the people; you altered the religion; but you never touched the form or the vital ſubſtance of free government in that kingdom. You depoſed kings; you reſtored them; you altered the ſucceſſion to theirs, as well as to your own crown; but you never altered their conſtitution; the principle of which was reſpected by uſurpation; reſtored with the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of monarchy, and eſtabliſhed, I truſt, for ever, by the glorious Revolution. This has made Ireland the great and flouriſhing kingdom that it is; and from a diſgrace and a burthen intolerable to this nation, has rendered a principal part of our ſtrength and ornament. This country cannot be ſaid to have ever formally taxed her. The irregular things done in the confuſion of mighty troubles, and on the hinge of great revolutions, even if all were done that is ſaid to have been done, form no example. If they have any effect in argument, they make an exception to prove the rule. None of your own liberties could ſtand a moment if the caſual deviations from them, at ſuch times, were ſuffered to be uſed as proofs of their nullity. By the lucrative amount of ſuch caſual breaches in the conſtitution, judge what the ſtated and fixed rule of ſupply has been in that kingdom. Your Iriſh penſioners would ſtarve, if they had no other fund to live on than taxes granted by Engliſh authority.

            <head>IRELAND. State of Ireland in 1780.</head>
            <p>THE firſt conceſſions to Ireland, by being (much againſt my will) mangled and ſtripped of the parts which were neceſſary to make out their juſt corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence and connection in trade, were of no uſe. The next year a feeble attempt was made to bring the thing into better ſhape. This attempt (countenanced by the miniſter<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord North.</note>) on the very firſt appearance of ſome popular uneaſineſs, was, after a conſiderable progreſs through the houſe, thrown out by <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What was the conſequence? The whole kingdom of Ireland was inſtantly in a flame. Threatened by foreigners, and, as they thought, inſulted by Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, they reſolved at once to reſiſt the power of France, and to caſt off yours. As for us, we were able neither to protect nor to reſtrain them. Forty thouſand men were raiſed and diſciplined without commiſſion from the crown. Two illegal armies were ſeen with banners diſplayed at the ſame time, and in the ſame country. No executive magiſtrate, no judicature, in Ireland, would acknowledge the legality of the army which bore the king's commiſſion; and no law, or appearance of law, authoriſed the army commiſſioned by itſelf. In this unexampled ſtate of things, which the leaſt error, the leaſt treſpaſs on the right or left, would have hurried down the precipice into an abyſs of blood and confuſion, the people of Ireland demand a freedom of trade with arms in their hands. They interdict all commerce between the two nations. They deny all new ſupply in the houſe of commons, although in time of war. They ſtint the truſt of the old revenue, given for two years to all the king's predeceſſors, to ſix months. The Britiſh parliament, in a former ſeſſion frightened into a limited conceſſion by the menaces of Ireland, frightened out of it by the menaces of England, was now frightened back again, and made an univerſal

ſurrender of all that had been thought the peculiar, reſerved, uncommunicable rights of England;—the excluſive commerce of America, of Africa, of the Weſt-Indies—all the enumerations of the acts of navigation—all the manufactures,—iron, glaſs, even the laſt pledge of jealouſy and pride, the intereſt hid in the ſecret of our hearts, the inveterate prejudice moulded into the conſtitution of our frame, even the ſacred fleece itſelf, all went together. No reſerve; no exception; no debate; no diſcuſſion. A ſudden light broke in upon us all. It broke in, not through well-contrived and well-diſpoſed windows, but through flaws and breaches; through the yawning chaſms of our ruin. We were taught wiſdom by humiliation. No town in England preſumed to have a prejudice; or dared to mutter a petition. What was worſe, the whole Parliament of England, which retained autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for nothing but ſurrenders, was deſpoiled of every ſhadow of its ſuperintendance. It was, without any qualification, denied in theory, as it had been trampled upon in practice. This ſcene of ſhame and diſgrace has, in a manner whilſt I am ſpeaking, ended by the perpetual eſtabliſhment of a military power, in the dominions of this crown, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Britiſh legiſlature<note n="*" place="bottom">Iriſh perpetual mutiny act.</note>, contrary to the policy of the conſtitution, contrary to the declaration of right: and by this your liberties are ſwept away along with your ſupreme authority—and both, linked together from the beginning, have, I am afraid, both together periſhed for ever.</p>
            <p>What! gentlemen, was I not to foreſee, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, was I not to endeavour to ſave you from all theſe multiplied miſchiefs and diſgraces? Would the little, ſilly, canvaſs prattle of obeying inſtructions, and having no opinions but yours, and ſuch idle ſenſeleſs tales, which amuſe the vacant ears of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking men, have ſaved you from

Was I an Iriſhman on that day, that I boldly withſtood our pride? or on the day that I hung down my head, and wept in ſhame and ſilence over the humiliation of Great Britain? I became unpopular in England for the one, and in Ireland for the other. What then? What obligation lay on me to be popular? I was bound to ſerve both kingdoms.

            <p>KINGS are naturally lovers of low company.—They are ſo elevated above all the reſt of mankind, that they muſt look upon all their ſubjects as on a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0244800201:299"/>
level. They are rather apt to hate than to love their nobility, on account of the occaſional reſiſtance to their will, which will be made by their virtue, their petulance, or their pride. It muſt indeed be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that many of the nobility are as perfectly willing to act the part of flatterers, tale-bearers, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites, pimps, and buſſoons, as any of the loweſt and vileſt of mankind can poſſibly be. But they are not properly qualified for this object of their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The want of a regular education, and early habits, and ſome lurking remains of their dignity, will never permit them to become a match for an Italian eunuch, a mountebank, a fidler, a player, or any regular practitioner of that tribe. The Roman Emperors, almoſt from the beginning, threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſuch hands, and the miſchief increaſed every day till its decline, and its final ruin. It is therefore of very great importance (provided the thing is not overdone) to contrive ſuch an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as muſt, almoſt whether a prince will or not, bring into daily and hourly offices about his perſon, a great number of his firſt nobility; and it is rather an uſeful prejudice that gives them a pride in ſuch a ſervitude. Though they are not much the better for a court, a court will be much the better for them. I have therefore not attempted to reform any of the offices of honour about the king's perſon.—<bibl>

            <head>KINGS (ADULATORY ADDRESSES TO).</head>
            <p>Dr. Price, in this ſermon<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 22, 23, 24.</note>, condemns very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the practice of groſs, adulatory addreſſes to kings. Inſtead of this fulſome ſtyle, he propoſes that his majeſty ſhould be told, on occaſions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation, that
<q rend="inline">"he is to conſider himſelf as more properly the ſervant than the ſovereign of his people."</q>
For a compliment, this new form of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0244800201:300"/>
addreſs does not ſeem to be very ſoothing. Thoſe who are ſervants, in name, as well as in effect, do not like to be told of their ſituation, their duty, and their obligations. The ſlave, in the old play, tells his maſter, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Haec commemoratio eſt quafi exprobratio.</hi>"</q> It is not pleaſant as compliment, it is not wholeſome as inſtruction. After all, if the king were to bring himſelf to echo this new kind of addreſs, to adopt it in terms, and even to take the appellation of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the People as his royal ſtyle, how either he or we ſhould be much mended by it, I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. I have ſeen very aſſuming letters, ſigned, Your moſt obedient, humble ſervant. The proudeſt domination that ever was endured on earth took a title of ſtill greater humility than that which is now propoſed for ſovereigns by the Apoſtle of Liberty. Kings and nations were trampled upon by the foot of one calling himſelf <q rend="inline">"the Servant of Servants;"</q> and mandates for depoſing ſovereigns were ſealed with the ſignet of <q rend="inline">"the Fiſherman."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould have conſidered all this as no more than a ſort of ſlippant vain diſcourſe, in which, as in an unſavory fume, ſeveral perſons ſuffer the ſpirit of liberty to evaporate, if it were not plainly in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the idea, and a part of the ſcheme of <q rend="inline">"ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiering kings for miſconduct."</q> In that light it is worth ſome obſervation.</p>
            <p>Kings, in one ſenſe, are undoubtedly the ſervants of the people, becauſe their power has no other ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional end than that of the general advantage; but it is not true that they are, in the ordinary ſenſe (by our conſtitution at leaſt) any thing like ſervants; the eſſence of whoſe ſituation is to obey the commands of ſome other, and to be removeable at pleaſure.—But the King of Great Britain obeys no other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; all other perſons are individually, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively too, under him, and owe to him a legal obedience. The law, which knows neither to flatter nor to inſult, calls this high magiſtrate, not our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0244800201:301"/>
as this humble Divine calls him, but <q rend="inline">"<hi>our ſovereign lord the King</hi>;"</q> and we, on our parts, have learned to ſpeak only the primitive language of the law, and not the confuſed jargon of their Babylonian pulpits.</p>
            <p>As he is not to obey us, but as we are to obey the law in him, our conſtitution has made no ſort of proviſion towards rendering him, as a ſervant, in any degree reſponſible. Our conſtitution knows nothing of a magiſtrate like the <hi>Juſticia</hi> of Arragon; nor of any court legally appointed, nor of any proceſs le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally ſettled for ſubmitting the king to the reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility belonging to all ſervants. In this he is not diſtinguiſhed from the Commons and the Lords; who, in their ſeveral public capacities, can never be called to an account for their conduct; although the Revolution Society chuſes to aſſert, in direct oppoſition to one of the wiſeſt and moſt beautiful parts of our conſtitution, that

            <head>KING'S MEN.</head>
            <p>TO reconcile the minds of the people to all theſe movements, principles correſpondent to them had been preached up with great zeal. Every one muſt remember that the cabal ſet out with the moſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing prudery, both moral and political. Thoſe who in a few months after ſouſed over head and ears into the deepeſt and dirtieſt pits of corruption, cried out violently againſt the indirect practices in the electing and managing of parliaments, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly prevailed. This marvellous abhorrence which the Court had ſuddenly taken to all influence, was not only circulated in converſation through the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but pompouſly announced to the public, with
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0244800201:302"/>
many other extraordinary things, in a pamphlet which had all the appearance of a manifeſto preparatory to ſome conſiderable enterprize. Throughout, it was a ſatire, though in terms managed and decent enough, on the politics of the former reign. It was indeed written with no ſmall art and addreſs.</p>
            <p>In this piece (Sentiments of an honeſt Man) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the firſt dawning of the new ſyſtem; there firſt appeared the idea (then only in ſpeculation) of <hi>ſeparating the court from the adminiſtration</hi>; of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing from national connection to perſonal regards; and of forming a regular party for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, under the name of <hi>king's men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To recommend this ſyſtem to the people, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective view of the Court, gorgeouſly painted, and finely illuminated from within, was exhibited to the gaping multitude. Party was to be totally done away, with all its evil works. Corruption was to be caſt down from Court, as Atè was from Heaven. Power was thenceforward to be the choſen reſidence of public ſpirit; and no one was to be ſuppoſed under any ſiniſter influence, except thoſe who had the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be in diſgrace at court, which was to ſtand in lieu of all vices and all corruptions. A ſcheme of perfection to be realized in a monarchy far beyond the viſionary republic of Plato. The whole ſcenery was exactly diſpoſed to captivate thoſe good ſouls, whoſe credulous morality is ſo invaluable a treaſure to crafty politicians. Indeed there was wherewithal to charm every body, except thoſe few who are not much pleaſed with profeſſions of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural virtue, who know of what ſtuff ſuch profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are made, for what purpoſes they are deſigned, and in what they are ſure conſtantly to end. Many innocent gentlemen, who had been talking proſe all their lives without knowing any thing of the matter, began at laſt to open their eyes upon their own merits, and to attribute their not having been Lords of the Treaſury and Lords of Trade many years before,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0244800201:303"/>
merely to the prevalence of party, and to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial power, which had fruſtrated the good intentions of the Court in favour of their abilities. Now was the time to unlock the ſealed fountain of royal bounty, which had been infamouſly monopolized and huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, and to let it flow at large upon the whole people. The time was come to reſtore royalty to its original ſplendor. <hi>Mettre le Roy hors de page,</hi> became a ſort of watch-word; and it was conſtantly in the mouths of all the runners of the Court, that nothing could preſerve the balance of the conſtitution from being overturned by the rabble, or by a faction of the nobility, but to free the ſovereign effectually from that miniſterial tyranny under which the royal dignity had been oppreſſed in the perſon of his Majeſty's grandfather.</p>
            <p>Theſe were ſome of the many artifices uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the people to the great change which was made in the perſons who compoſed the miniſtry, and the ſtill greater which was made and avowed in its conſtitution. As to individuals, other methods were employed with them; in order ſo thoroughly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite every party, and even every family, that <hi>no concert; order, or effect, might appear in any future oppoſition.</hi> And in this manner an Adminiſtration, without connection with the people, or with one another, was firſt put in poſſeſſion of government. What good conſequences followed from it; we have all ſeen; whether with regard to virtue, public or private; to the eaſe and happineſs of the ſovereign; or to the real ſtrength of government. But as ſo much ſtreſs was then laid on the neceſſity of this new project, it will not be amiſs to take a view of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this royal ſervitude and vile durance, which was ſo deplored in the reign of the late monarch, and was ſo carefully to be avoided in the reign of his ſucceſſor.—<bibl>

            <head>KING OF GREAT BRITAIN. Crown of England hereditary. (See KING'S MEN, PRINCES, MINISTERS, CABINET (DOUBLE), RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOLUTION SOCIETY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THERE is ground enough for the opinion that all the kingdoms of Europe were, at a remote period, elective, with more or fewer limitations in the objects of choice; but whatever kings might have been here or elſewhere, a thouſand years ago, or in whatever manner the ruling dynaſties of England or France may have begun, the King of Great Britain is at this day king by a fixed rule of ſucceſſion, according to the laws of his country; and whilſt the legal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the compact of ſovereignty are performed by him (as they are performed) he holds his crown in contempt of the choice of the Revolution Society, who have not a ſingle vote for a king amongſt them, either individually or collectively; though I make no doubt they would ſoon erect themſelves into an elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral college, if things were ripe to give effect to their claim. His Majeſty's heirs and ſucceſſors, each in his time and order, will come to the crown with the ſame contempt of their choice with which his Majeſty has ſucceeded to that he wears.</p>
            <p>Whatever may be the ſucceſs of evaſion in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining away the groſs error of <hi>fact,</hi> which ſuppoſes that his Majeſty (though he holds it in concurrence with the wiſhes) owes his crown to the choice of his people, yet nothing can evade their full explicit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, concerning the principle of a right in the people to chuſe, which right is directly maintained, and tenaciouſly adhered to. All the oblique inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations concerning election bottom in this propoſition, and are referable to it. Leſt the foundation of the king's excluſive legal title ſhould paſs for a mere rant

of adulatory freedom, the political divine (Dr. Price) proceeds dogmatically to aſſert<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 34, Diſcourſe on the Love of our Country.</note>, that by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the revolution, the people of England have acquired three fundamental rights, all which, with him, compoſe one ſyſtem, and lie together in one ſhort ſentence; namely, that we have acquired a right
<q>

                     <item>1. "To chuſe our own governors."</item>

                  </list>
               </q>
This new, and hitherto unheard of bill of rights, though made in the name of the whole people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to thoſe gentlemen (Revolution Society) and their faction only. The body of the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land have no ſhare in it; they utterly diſclaim it; they will reſiſt the practical aſſertion of it with their lives and fortunes. They are bound to do ſo by the laws of their country, made at the time of that very revolution, which is appealed to in favour of the fictitious rights claimed by the ſociety which abuſes its name.</p>
            <p>Theſe gentlemen of the Old Jewry, in all their reaſonings on the revolution of 1688, have a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which happened in England about forty years before, and the late French revolution, ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, and in their hearts, that they are conſtantly confounding all the three together. It is neceſſary that we ſhould ſeparate what they confound. We muſt recall their erring fancies to the <hi>acts</hi> of the revolution which we revere, for the diſcovery of its true <hi>principles.</hi> If the <hi>principles</hi> of the revolution of 1688 are any where to be found, it is in the ſtatute called the <hi>Declaration of Right.</hi> In that moſt wiſe, ſober, and conſiderate declaration, drawn up by great lawyers and great ſtateſmen, and not by warm and inexperienced enthuſiaſts, not one word is ſaid, nor one ſuggeſtion made, of a general right
<q rend="inline">"to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0244800201:306"/>
chuſe our own <hi>governors</hi>; to caſhier them for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct; and to <hi>form</hi> a government for <hi>ourſelves.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>This declaration of right (the act of the 1ſt of William and Mary, ſeſſ. 2. ch. 2.) is the corner-ſtone of our conſtitution, as reinforced, explained, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and in its fundamental principles for ever ſettled. It is called
<q rend="inline">"An act for declaring the rights and liberties of the ſubject, and for <hi>ſettling</hi> the <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of the crown."</q>
You will obſerve, that theſe rights and this ſucceſſion are declared in one body, and bound indiſſolubly together.</p>
            <p>A few years after this period, a ſecond opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offered for aſſerting a right of election to the crown. On the proſpect of a total failure of iſſue from King William, and from the Princeſs, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Queen Anne, the conſideration of the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the crown, and of a further ſecurity for the liberties of the people, again came before the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature. Did they this ſecond time make any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for legalizing the crown on the ſpurious revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution principles of the Old Jewry? No. They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the principles which prevailed in the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Right; indicating with more preciſion the perſons who were to inherit in the Proteſtant line.—This act alſo incorporated, by the ſame policy, our liberties, and an hereditary ſucceſſion in the ſame act. Inſtead of a right to chuſe our own governors, they declared that the <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> in that line (the Proteſtant line drawn from James the Firſt) was abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <q rend="inline">"for the peace, quiet, and ſecurity of the realm,"</q> and that it was equally urgent on them
<q rend="inline">"to maintain a <hi>certainty in the ſucceſſion</hi> thereof, to which the ſubjects may ſafely have recourſe for their protection."</q>
Both theſe acts, in which are heard the unerring, unambiguous oracles of revolution policy, inſtead of countenancing the deluſive, gipſey predictions of a <q rend="inline">"right to chuſe our governors,"</q> prove to a demonſtration how totally adverſe the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0244800201:307"/>
of the nation was from turning a caſe of neceſſity into a rule of law.</p>
            <p>Unqueſtionably there was at the revolution, in the perſon of King William, a ſmall and a temporary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from the ſtrict order of a regular hereditary ſucceſſion; but it is againſt all genuine principles of juriſprudence to draw a principle from a law made in a ſpecial caſe, and regarding an individual perſon. <hi>Privilegium non tranſit in exemplum.</hi> If ever there was a time favourable for eſtabliſhing the principle, that a king of popular choice was the only legal king, without all doubt it was at the revolution. Its not being done at that time is a proof that the nation was of opinion it ought not to be done at any time. There is no perſon ſo completely ignorant of our hiſtory, as not to know that the majority in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both parties were ſo little diſpoſed to any thing reſembling that principle, that at firſt they were determined to place the vacant crown, not on the head of the Prince of Orange, but on that of his wife Mary, daughter of King James, the eldeſt born of the iſſue of that king, which they acknowledged as undoubtedly his. It would be to repeat a very trite ſtory, to recall to your memory all thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which demonſtrated that their accepting King William was not properly a <hi>choice;</hi> but to all thoſe who did not wiſh, in effect, to recall King James, or to deluge their country in blood, and again to bring their religion, laws, and liberties into the peril they had juſt eſcaped, it was an act of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> in the ſtricteſt moral ſenſe in which neceſſity can be taken.</p>
            <p>In the very act, in which, for a time, and in a ſingle caſe, Parliament departed from the ſtrict order of inheritance, in favour of a prince, who, though not next, was however very near in the line of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, it is curious to obſerve how Lord Somers, who drew the bill, called the Declaration of Right, has comported himſelf on that delicate occaſion. It is curious to obſerve with what addreſs this temporary
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0244800201:308"/>
ſolution of continuity is kept from the eye; whilſt all that could be found in this act of neceſſity to countenance the idea of an hereditary ſucceſſion is brought forward, and foſtered, and made the moſt of, by this great man, and by the Legiſlature who followed him. Quitting the dry, imperative ſtyle of an act of Parliament, he makes the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons fall to a pious, legiſlative ejaculation, and declare, that they conſider it
<q rend="inline">"as a marvellous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and merciful goodneſs of God to this nation, to preſerve their ſaid Majeſties <hi>royal</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, moſt happily to reign over us <hi>on the throne of their anceſtors,</hi> for which, from the bottom of their hearts, they return their humbleſt thanks and praiſes."</q>
The Legiſlature plainly had in view the act of recognition of the firſt of Queen Elizabeth, chap. 3d, and of that of James the Firſt, chap. 1ſt, both acts ſtrongly declaratory of the inheritable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the crown, and in many parts they follow, with a nearly literal preciſion, the words, and even the form of thankſgiving, which is found in theſe old declaratory ſtatutes.</p>
            <p>The two houſes, in the act of King William, did not thank God that they had found a fair opportunity to aſſert a right to chooſe their own governors, much leſs to make an election the <hi>only lawful</hi> title to the crown. Their having been in a condition to avoid the very appearance of it, as much as poſſible, was by them conſidered as a providential eſcape. They threw a politic, well-wrought veil over every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance tending to weaken the rights, which in the meliorated order of ſucceſſion they meant to perpetuate; or which might furniſh a precedent for any future departure from what they had then ſettled for ever. Accordingly, that they might not relax the nerves of their monarchy, and that they might preſerve a cloſe conformity to the practice of their anceſtors, as it appeared in the declaratory ſtatutes of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0244800201:309"/>
Queen Mary<note n="*" place="bottom">1ſt Mary, ſeſſ. 3. ch. 1.</note> and Queen Elizabeth, in the next clauſe they veſt, by recognition, in their majeſties, <hi>all</hi> the legal prerogatives of the crown, declaring,
<q rend="inline">"that in them they are moſt <hi>fully,</hi> rightfully, and <hi>intirely</hi> inveſted, incorporated, united, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed."</q>
In the clauſe which follows, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting queſtions, by reaſon of any pretended titles to the crown, they declare (obſerving alſo in this the traditionary language, along with the traditionary policy of the nation, and repeating as from a rubric the language of the preceding acts of Elizabeth and James) that on the preſerving
<q rend="inline">"a <hi>certainty</hi> in the SUCCESSION thereof, the unity, peace, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of this nation doth, under God, wholly depend."</q>
            </p>
            <p>They knew that a doubtful title of ſucceſſion would but too much reſemble an election; and that an election would be utterly deſtructive of the <q rend="inline">"unity, peace, and tranquillity of this nation,"</q> which they thought to be conſiderations of ſome moment. To provide for theſe objects, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to exclude for ever the Old Jewry doctrine of <q rend="inline">"a right to chooſe our own governors,"</q> they follow with a clauſe, containing a moſt ſolemn pledge, taken from the preceding act of Queen Elizabeth, as ſolemn a pledge as ever was or can be given in favour of an hereditary ſucceſſion, and as ſolemn a renunciation as could be made of the principles by this ſociety imputed to them.
<q rend="inline">"The lords ſpiritual and temporal, and commons, do, in the name of all the people aforeſaid, moſt humbly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubmit <hi>themſelves, their heirs and poſterities for ever;</hi> and do faithfully promiſe, that they will ſtand to, maintain, and defend their ſaid majeſties, and alſo the <hi>limitation of the crown,</hi> herein ſpecified and contained, to the utmoſt of their powers," &amp;c.

               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0244800201:310"/>So far is it from being true, that we acquired a right by the revolution to elect our kings, that if we had poſſeſſed it before, the Engliſh nation did at that time moſt ſolemnly renounce and abdicate it, for themſelves, and for all their poſterity for ever. Theſe gentlemen may value themſelves as much as they pleaſe on their whig principles; but I never deſire to be thought a better whig than Lord Somers; or to underſtand the principles of the revolution better than thoſe by whom it was brought about; or to read in the declaration of right any myſteries unknown to thoſe whoſe penetrating ſtyle has engraved in our ordinances, and in our hearts, the words and ſpirit of that immortal law.</p>
            <p>It is true that, aided with the powers derived from force and opportunity, the nation was at that time, in ſome ſenſe, free to take what courſe it pleaſed for filling the throne; but only free to do ſo upon the ſame grounds on which they might have wholly aboliſhed their monarchy, and every other part of their conſtitution. However they did not think ſuch bold changes within their commiſſion. It is indeed difficult, perhaps impoſſible, to give limits to the mere <hi>abſtract</hi> competence of the ſupreme power, ſuch as was exerciſed by parliament at that time; but the limits of a <hi>moral</hi> competence, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting, even in powers more indiſputably ſovereign, occaſional will to permanent reaſon, and to the ſteady maxims of faith, juſtice, and fixed fundamental po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, are perfectly intelligible, and perfectly binding upon thoſe who exerciſe any authority, under any name, or under any title, in the ſtate. The houſe of lords, for inſtance, is not morally competent to diſſolve the houſe of commons; no, nor even to diſſolve itſelf, nor to abdicate, if it would, its portion in the legiſlature of the kingdom. Though a king may abdicate for his own perſon, he cannot abdicate for the monarchy. By as ſtrong, or by a ſtronger reaſon, the houſe of commons cannot renounce its
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0244800201:311"/>
ſhare of authority. The engagement and pact of ſociety, which generally goes by the name of the conſtitution, forbids ſuch invaſion and ſuch ſurrender. The conſtituent parts of a ſtate are obliged to hold their public faith with each other, and with all thoſe who derive any ſerious intereſt under their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as much as the whole ſtate is bound to keep its faith with ſeparate communities. Otherwiſe competence and power would ſoon be confounded, and no law be left but the will of a prevailing force. On this principle the ſucceſſion of the crown has always been what it now is, an hereditary ſucceſſion by law: in the old line it was a ſucceſſion by the common law; in the new by the ſtatute law, operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the principles of the common law, not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubſtance, but regulating the mode, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the perſons. Both theſe deſcriptions of law are of the ſame force, and are derived from an equal authority, emanating from the common agreement and original compact of the ſtate, <hi>communi ſponſione reipublicae,</hi> and as ſuch are equally binding on king and people too, as long as the terms are obſerved, and they continue the ſame body politic.</p>
            <p>It is far from impoſſible to reconcile, if we do not ſuffer ourſelves to be entangled in the mazes of metaphyſic ſophiſtry, the uſe both of a fixed rule and an occaſional deviation; the ſacredneſs of an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary principle of ſucceſſion in our government, with a power of change in its application in caſes of extreme emergency. Even in that extremity (if we take the meaſure of our rights by our exerciſe of them at the revolution) the change is to be confined to the peccant part only; to the part which produced the neceſſary deviation; and even then it is to be effected without a decompoſition of the whole civil and political maſs, for the purpoſe of originating a new civil order out of the firſt elements of ſociety.</p>
            <p>A ſtate without the means of ſome change is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the means of its conſervation. Without ſuch
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0244800201:312"/>
means it might even riſk the loſs of that part of the conſtitution which it wiſhed the moſt religiouſly to preſerve. The two principles of conſervation and correction operated ſtrongly at the two critical pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of the reſtoration and revolution, when Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land found itſelf without a king. At both thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods the nation had loſt the bond of union in their antient edifice; they did not, however, diſſolve the whole fabric. On the contrary, in both caſes they regenerated the deficient part of the old conſtitution through the parts which were not impaired. They kept theſe old parts exactly as they were, that the part recovered might be ſuited to them. They acted by the antient organized ſtates in the ſhape of their old organization, and not by the organic <hi>moleculoe</hi> of a diſbanded people. At no time, perhaps, did the ſovereign legiſlature manifeſt a more tender regard to that fundamental principle of Britiſh conſtitutional policy, than at the time of the revolution, when it deviated from the direct line of hereditary ſucceſſion. The crown was carried ſomewhat out of the line in which it had before moved; but the new line was derived from the ſame ſtock. It was ſtill a line of hereditary deſcent; ſtill an hereditary deſcent in the ſame blood, though an hereditary deſcent qualified with proteſtantiſm. When the legiſlature altered the direction, but kept the principle, they ſhewed that they held it inviolable.</p>
            <p>On this principle, the law of inheritance had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome amendment in the old time, and long before the aera of the revolution. Some time after the conqueſt, great queſtions aroſe upon the legal principles of hereditary deſcent. It became a matter of doubt, whether the heir <hi>per capita</hi> or the heir <hi>per ſtirpes</hi> was to ſucceed; but whether the heir <hi>per ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pita</hi> gave way when the heirdom <hi>per ſtirpes</hi> took place, or the catholic heir when the proteſtant was preferred, the inheritable principle ſurvived with a ſort of immortality through all tranſmigrations—
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0244800201:313"/>
               <hi>multoſque per annos ſlat fortuna domûs et avi numerantur avorum.</hi> This is the ſpirit of our conſtitution, not only in its ſettled courſe, but in all its revolutions. Whoever came in, or however he came in, whether he obtained the crown by law, or by force, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary ſucceſſion was either continued or adopted.</p>
            <p>The gentlemen of the ſociety for revolutions ſee nothing in that of 1688 but the deviation from the conſtitution; and they take the deviation from the principle for the principle. They have little regard to the obvious conſequences of their doctrine, though they muſt ſee, that it leaves poſitive authority in very few of the poſitive inſtitutions of this country. When ſuch an unwarrantable maxim is once eſtabliſhed, that no throne is lawful but the elective, no one act of the princes who preceded their aera of fictitious election can be valid. Do theſe theoriſts mean to imitate ſome of their predeceſſors, who dragged the bodies of our antient ſovereigns out of the quiet of their tombs? Do they mean to attaint and diſable backwards all the kings that have reigned before the revolution, and conſequently to ſtain the throne of England with the blot of a continual uſurpation? Do they mean to invalidate, annul, or to call into queſtion, together with the titles of the whole line of our kings, that great body of our ſtatute law which paſſed under thoſe whom they treat as uſurpers? to annul laws of ineſtimable value to our liberties—of as great value at leaſt as any which have paſſed at or ſince the period of the revolution? If kings, who did not owe their crown to the choice of their people, had no title to make laws, what will become of the ſtatute <hi>de tullagio non concedendo?</hi>—of the <hi>petition of right?</hi>—of the act of <hi>habeas corpus?</hi> Do theſe new doctors of the rights of men preſume to aſſert, that King James the Second, who came to the crown as next of blood, according to the rules of a then unqualified ſucceſſion, was not to all intents and purpoſes a lawful king of England, before he had
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0244800201:314"/>
done any of thoſe acts which were juſtly conſtrued into an abdication of his crown? If he was not; much trouble in parliament might have been ſaved at the period theſe gentlemen commemorate. But King James was a bad king with a good title, and not an uſurper. The princes who ſucceeded according to the act of parliament which ſettled the crown on the electreſs Sophia and on her deſcendants, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, came in as much by a title of inheritance as King James did. He came in according to the law, as it ſtood at his acceſſion to the crown; and the princes of the houſe of Brunſwick came to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the crown, not by election, but by the law, as it ſtood at their ſeveral acceſſions of proteſtant deſcent and inheritance, as I hope I have ſhewn ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently.</p>
            <p>The law by which this royal family is ſpecifically deſtined to the ſucceſſion, is the act of the 12th and 13th of King William. The terms of this act bind
<q rend="inline">"us and our <hi>heirs,</hi> and our <hi>poſterity,</hi> to them, their <hi>heirs,</hi> and their <hi>poſterity,</hi>"</q> the declaration of right had bound us to the heirs of King William and Queen Mary.
It therefore ſecures both an heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary crown and an hereditary allegiance. On what ground, except the conſtitutional policy of forming an eſtabliſhment to ſecure that kind of ſucceſſion which is to preclude a choice of the people for ever, could the legiſlature have faſtidiouſly rejected the fair and abundant choice which our own country preſented to them, and ſearched in ſtrange lands for a foreign princeſs, from whoſe womb the line of our future rulers were to derive their title to govern millions of men through a ſeries of ages?</p>
            <p>The Princeſs Sophia was named in the act of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the 12th and 13th of King William, for a <hi>ſtock</hi> and root of <hi>inheritance</hi> to our kings, and not for her merits as a temporary adminiſtratrix of a power, which ſhe might not, and, in fact, did not, herſelf ever exerciſe. She was adopted for one reaſon,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0244800201:315"/>
and for one only, becauſe, ſays the act,
<q rend="inline">"the moſt excellent Princeſs Sophia, Electreſs and Dutcheſs Dowager of Hanover, is <hi>daughter</hi> of the moſt excellent Princeſs Elizabeth, late Queen of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, <hi>daughter</hi> of our late <hi>ſovereign lord</hi> King James the Firſt, of happy memory, and is hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the next in <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> in the Proteſtant line," &amp;c.
&amp;c.;
 "and the crown ſhall continue to the <hi>heirs</hi> of her body, being Proteſtants."</q>
This limitation was made by parliament, that through the Princeſs Sophia an inheritable line, not only was to be continued in future, but (what they thought very material) that through her it was to be connected with the old ſtock of inheritance in King James the Firſt; in order that the monarchy might preſerve an unbroken unity through all ages, and might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (with ſafety to our religion) in the old ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved mode by deſcent, in which, if our liberties had been once endangered, they had often, through all ſtorms and ſtruggles of prerogative and privilege, been preſerved. They did well. No experience hrs taught us, that in any other courſe or method than that of an <hi>hereditary crown,</hi> our liberties can be regularly perpetuated and preſerved ſacred as our <hi>hereditary right.</hi> An irregular, convulſive movement may be neceſſary to throw off an irregular, convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive diſeaſe. But the courſe of ſucceſſion is the healthy habit of the Britiſh conſtitution. Was it that the legiſlature wanted, at the act for the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the crown in the Hanoverian line, drawn through the female deſcendants of James the Firſt, a due ſenſe of the inconveniencies of having two or three, or poſſibly more, foreigners in ſucceſſion to the Britiſh throne? No!—they had a due ſenſe of the evils which might happen from ſuch foreign rule, and more than a due ſenſe of them. But a more deciſive proof cannot be given of the full conviction of the Britiſh nation, that the principles of the revolution did not authorize them to elect kings at their pleaſure, and without any attention to the antient fundamental
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0244800201:316"/>
principles of our government, than their continuing to adopt a plan of hereditary Proteſtant ſucceſſion in the old line, with all the dangers and all the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of its being a foreign line full before their eyes, and operating with the utmoſt force upon their minds.—<bibl>

            <p>KINGS, even ſuch as are truly kings, may and ought to bear the freedom of ſubjects that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to them.

Louis the XIIIth mortally hated the cardinal de Richlieu; but his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that miniſter againſt his rivals was the ſource of all the glory of his reign, and the ſolid foundation of his throne itſelf. Louis the XIVth, when come to the throne, did not love the cardinal Mazarin; but for his intereſts he preſerved him in power. When old, he deteſted Louvois; but for years, whilſt he faithfully ſerved his greatneſs, he endured his perſon. When George II. took Mr. Pitt, who certainly was not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, into his councils, he did nothing which could humble a wiſe ſovereign.
