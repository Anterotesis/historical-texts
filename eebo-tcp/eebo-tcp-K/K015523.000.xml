            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </l>
               <l>When the fierce Dane inſulted England's ſhore;</l>
               <l>She, hapleſs iſle, in the wild tempeſt toſt,</l>
               <l>Saw all but her inherent courage loſt;</l>
               <l>Like ſome ſtout ſhip, which, ſinking to her grave,</l>
               <l>Surveys what none but Britiſh hearts can brave,</l>
               <l>Death in a thouſand ſhapes of horror dreſt,</l>
               <l>Night without ſtars, and billows without reſt;</l>
               <l>When ſome bold voice, loud as the roaring ſea,</l>
               <l>Cries out—"All hands! the port is in our lea!"</l>
               <l>Inſtant they rouſe—brace up the ſwelling ſail,</l>
               <l>She rights, ſhe lifts, ſhe rides before the gale;</l>
               <l>Then ſafe in port the joyous glaſs goes round,</l>
               <l>And all paſt ſorrows in that glaſs are drown'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So in the night of England's deep deſpair,</l>
               <l>Great Alfred, iſſuing from his ſecret lair,</l>
               <l>Roſe like a meteor—The glad nation heard</l>
               <l>His glorious call; and this was Alfred's word—</l>
               <l>"Fight, fight! or periſh in your country's cauſe,</l>
               <l>"Stand for your king, your liberties, your laws:</l>
               <l>"'Tis Alfred leads you on—his heart is true,</l>
               <l>"And he, for whom your bleed, ſhall bleed for you!"</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Sons of that gallant race, to you we give</l>

               <l>View them with candor, give the ſketch ſome praiſe,</l>
               <l>Which features out the chiefs of ancient days</l>
               <l>And recollect whatever here is ſhewn,</l>
               <l>Their cauſe, their courage, both are now your own:</l>
               <l>They met the fierce invader at their doors,</l>
               <l>No foes but captive foes invade your ſhores;</l>
               <l>Their wives, their daughters, fill'd the air with cries,</l>
               <l>To your kind land the helpleſs ſufferer flies;</l>
               <l>Bleſt in a king, mild, merciful, and good,</l>
               <l>Firm in allegiance to that king they ſtood,</l>
               <l>When they ſaw death, diſeaſe, or danger near,</l>
               <l>All, all was terror for a life ſo dear.</l>
               <l>Theſe are the ſcenes our drama ſets to view—</l>

diffuſe thro' the admiring world: victorious as he is, and great in warlike

diſplay: then he will ſhine; and you, who may expect to ſee thoſe
