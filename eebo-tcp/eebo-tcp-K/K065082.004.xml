            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHILE the Romans languiſhed under the ignominious tyranny of eunuchs and biſhops, the praiſes of Julian were <note place="margin">The jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius againſt Julian.</note> repeated with tranſport in every part of the empire, except in the palace of Conſtantius. The Barbarians of Germany had felt, and ſtill dreaded, the arms of the young Caeſar; his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were the companions of his victory; the grateful provincials enjoyed the bleſſings of his reign; but the favourites, who had oppoſed his elevation, were offended by his virtues; and they juſtly conſidered the friend of the people as the enemy of the court. As long as the fame
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0034700104:9"/>
of Julian was doubtful, the buffoons of the palace, who were ſkilled in the language of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, tried the efficacy of thoſe arts which they had ſo often practiſed with ſucceſs. They eaſily diſcovered, that his ſimplicity was not exempt from affectation: the ridiculous epithets of an hairy ſavage, of an ape inveſted with the purple, were applied to the dreſs and perſon of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic warrior; and his modeſt diſpatches were ſtigmatized as the vain and elaborate fictions of a loquacious Greek, a ſpeculative ſoldier, who had ſtudied the art of war amidſt the groves of the academy <note n="1" place="bottom">Omnes qui plus poterant in palatio, adulandi profeſſores jam docti, recte conſulta, proſpereque completa vertebant in deridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum: talia ſine modo ſtrepentes inſulſe; in odium venit cum vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriis ſuis; capella, non homo; ut hirſutum Julianum carpentes, appellanteſque loquacem talpam, et purpuratam ſimiam, et litterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Graecum: et his congruentia plurima atque vernacula principi reſonantes, audire haec taliaque geſtienti, virtutes ejus obruere verbis impudentibus conabantur, ut ſegnem inceſſentes et timidum et um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bratilem, geſtaque ſecus verbis comptioribus exornantem. Ammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, xvii. 11.</note>. The voice of malicious folly was at length ſilenced by the ſhouts of victory; the conqueror of the Franks and Alemanni could no longer be painted as an object of contempt; and the monarch himſelf was meanly ambitious of ſtealing from his lieutenant the honourable reward of his labours. In the letters crowned with laurel, which, according to ancient cuſtom, were addreſſed to the provinces, the name of Julian was omitted. <q>Conſtantius had made his diſpoſitions in perſon; <hi>he</hi> had ſignalized his valour in the foremoſt ranks; <hi>his</hi> military
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0034700104:10"/>
conduct had ſecured the victory; and the captive king of the Barbarians was preſented to <hi>him</hi> on the field of battle,</q> from which he was at that time diſtant above forty days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <note n="2" place="bottom">Ammian. xvi. 12. The orator Themiſtius (iv. p. 56, 57.) believed whatever was contained in the Imperial letters, which were addreſſed to the ſenate of Conſtantinople. Aurelius Victor, who publiſhed his Abridgment in the laſt year of Conſtantius, aſcribes the German victories to the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the emperor, and the <hi>fortune</hi> of the Caeſar. Yet the hiſtorian, ſoon afterwards, was indebted to the favour or eſteem of Julian for the honour of a braſs ſtatue; and the important offices of conſular of the ſecond Pannonia, and praefect of the city. Ammian. xxi. 10.</note>. So extravagant a fable was incapable, however, of deceiving the public credulity, or even of ſatisfying the pride of the emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Secretly conſcious that the applauſe and favour of the Romans accompanied the riſing fortunes of Julian, his diſcontented mind was prepared to receive the ſubtle poiſon of thoſe artful ſycophants, who coloured their miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſigns with the faireſt appearances of truth and candour <note n="3" place="bottom">Callido nocendi artificio, accuſatoriam diritatem laudum titulis peragebant. . . Hae voces fuerunt ad inſlammanda odia probris om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus potentiores. See Mamertin. in Actione Gratiarum in Vet. Panegyr. xi. 5, 6.</note>. Inſtead of depreciating the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Julian, they acknowledged, and even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated, his popular fame, ſuperior talents, and important ſervices. But they darkly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, that the virtues of the Caeſar might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly be converted into the moſt dangerous crimes; if the inconſtant multitude ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their inclinations to their duty; or if the general of a victorious army ſhould be tempted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0034700104:11"/>
from his allegiance by the hopes of revenge, and independent greatneſs. The perſonal fears of Conſtantius were interpreted by his council as <note place="margin">Fears and envy of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> a laudable anxiety for the public ſafety; whilſt in private, and perhaps in his own breaſt, he diſguiſed, under the leſs odious appellation of fear, the ſentiments of hatred and envy, which he had ſecretly conceived for the inimitable virtues of Julian.</p>
            <p>The apparent tranquillity of Gaul, and the <note place="margin">The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Gaul are ordered to march into the Eaſt, A. D. 360, April.</note> imminent danger of the eaſtern provinces, offered a ſpecious pretence for the deſign which was art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully concerted by the Imperial miniſters. They reſolved to diſarm the Caeſar; to recall thoſe faithful troops who guarded his perſon and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and to employ in a diſtant war againſt the Perſian monarch, the hardy veterans who had vanquiſhed, on the banks of the Rhine, the fierceſt nations of Germany. While Julian uſed the laborious hours of his winter-quarters at Paris in the adminiſtration of power, which, in his hands, was the exerciſe of virtue, he was ſurpriſed by the haſty arrival of a tribune and a notary; with poſitive orders from the emperor, which <hi>they</hi> were directed to execute, and <hi>he</hi> was commanded not to oppoſe. Conſtantius ſignified his pleaſure, that four entire legions, the Celtae, and Petulants, the Heruli, and the Batavians, ſhould be ſeparated from the ſtandard of Julian, under which they had acquired their fame and diſcipline; that in each of the remaining bands, three hundred of the braveſt youths ſhould be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0034700104:12"/>
ſelected; and that this numerous detachment, the ſtrength of the Gallic army, ſhould inſtantly begin their march, and exert their utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to arrive, before the opening of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, on the frontiers of Perſia <note n="4" place="bottom">The minute interval, which may be interpoſed between the <hi>byeme adultâ</hi> and the <hi>primo vere</hi> of Ammianus (xx. 1. 4.), inſtead of allowing a ſufficient ſpace for a march of three thouſand miles, would render the orders of Conſtantius as extravagant as they were unjuſt. The troops of Gaul could not have reached Syria till the end of autumn. The memory of Ammianus muſt have been inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, and his language incorrect.</note>. The Caeſar foreſaw, and lamented, the conſequences of this fatal mandate. Moſt of the auxiliaries, who engaged their voluntary ſervice, had ſtipulated, that they ſhould never be obliged to paſs the Alps. The public faith of Rome, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal honour of Julian, had been pledged for the obſervance of this condition. Such an act of treachery and oppreſſion would deſtroy the confidence, and excite the reſentment, of the independent warriors of Germany, who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered truth as the nobleſt of their virtues, and freedom as the moſt valuable of their poſſeſſions. The legionaries, who enjoyed the title and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of Romans, were enliſted for the general defence of the republic; but thoſe mercenary troops heard with cold indifference the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated names of the republic and of Rome. Attached, either from birth or long habit, to the climate and manners of Gaul, they loved and admired Julian; they deſpiſed, and perhaps hated, the emperor; they dreaded the laborious march, the Perſian arrows, and the burning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0034700104:13"/>
of Aſia. They claimed, as their own, the country which they had ſaved; and excuſed their want of ſpirit, by pleading the ſacred and more immediate duty of protecting their families and friends. The apprehenſions of the Gauls were derived from the knowledge of the impending and inevitable danger. As ſoon as the provinces were exhauſted of their military ſtrength, the Germans would violate a treaty which had been impoſed on their fears; and notwithſtanding the abilities and valour of Julian, the general of a nominal army, to whom the public calamities would be imputed, muſt find himſelf, after a vain reſiſtance, either a priſoner in the camp of the Barbarians, or a criminal in the palace of Conſtantius. If Julian complied with the orders which he had received, he ſubſcribed his own deſtruction, and that of a people who deſerved his affection. But a poſitive refuſal was an act of rebellion, and a declaration of war. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable jealouſy of the emperor, the peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and perhaps inſidious, nature of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, left not any room for a fair apology, or candid interpretation; and the dependent ſtation of the Caeſar ſcarcely allowed him to pauſe or to deliberate. Solitude encreaſed the perplexity of Julian; he could no longer apply to the faithful counſels of Salluſt, who had been removed from his office by the judicious malice of the eunuchs: he could not even enforce his repreſentations by the concurrence of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who would have been afraid, or aſhamed,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0034700104:14"/>
to approve the ruin of Gaul. The moment had been choſen, when Lupicinus, <note n="5" place="bottom">Ammianus, xx. 1. The valour of Lupicinus, and his mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſkill, are acknowledged by the hiſtorian, who, in his affected language, accuſes the general of exalting the horns of his pride, bellowing in a tragic tone, and exciting a doubt, whether he was more cruel or avaricious. The danger from the Scots and Picts was ſo ſerious, that Julian himſelf had ſome thoughts of paſſing over into the iſland.</note> the general of the cavalry, was diſpatched into Britain, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe the inroads of the Scots and Picts; and Florentius was occupied at Vienna by the aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the tribute. The latter, a crafty and corrupt ſtateſman, declining to aſſume a reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible part on this dangerous occaſion, eluded the preſſing and repeated invitations of Julian, who repreſented to him, that in every important mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the preſence of the praefect was indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in the council of the prince. In the mean while the Caeſar was oppreſſed by the rude and importunate ſolicitations of the Imperial meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who preſumed to ſuggeſt, that if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the return of his miniſters, he would charge himſelf with the guilt of the delay, and reſerve for them the merit of the execution. Unable to reſiſt, unwilling to comply, Julian expreſſed, in the moſt ſerious terms, his wiſh, and even his intention, of reſigning the purple, which he could not preſerve with honour, but which he could not abdicate with ſafety.</p>
            <p>After a painful conflict, Julian was compelled <note place="margin">Their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents.</note> to acknowledge, that obedience was the virtue of the moſt eminent ſubject, and that the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0034700104:15"/>
alone was entitled to judge of the public welfare. He iſſued the neceſſary orders for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into execution the commands of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius; a part of the troops began their march for the Alps; and the detachments from the ſeveral garriſons moved towards their reſpective places of aſſembly. They advanced with difficulty through the trembling and affrighted crowds of provincials; who attempted to excite their pity by ſilent deſpair, or loud lamentations; while the wives of the ſoldiers, holding their infants in their arms, accuſed the deſertion of their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in the mixed language of grief, of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and of indignation. This ſcene of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diſtreſs afflicted the humanity of the Caeſar; he granted a ſufficient number of poſt-waggons to tranſport the wives and families of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers <note n="6" place="bottom">He granted them the permiſſion of the <hi>curſus clavularis,</hi> or <hi>clabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris.</hi> Theſe poſt-waggons are often mentioned in the Code, and were ſuppoſed to carry fifteen hundred pounds weight.

The grief of an armed multitude is ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into rage; their licentious murmurs, which every hour were communicated from tent to tent with more boldneſs and effect, prepared their minds for the moſt daring acts of ſedition; and by the connivance of their tribunes, a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable libel was ſecretly diſperſed, which paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0034700104:16"/>
in lively colours, the diſgrace of the Caeſar, the oppreſſion of the Gallic army, and the feeble vices of the tyrant of Aſia. The ſervants of Conſtantius were aſtoniſhed and alarmed by the progreſs of this dangerous ſpirit. They preſſed the Caeſar to haſten the departure of the troops; but they imprudently rejected the honeſt and judicious advice of Julian; who propoſed that they ſhould not march through Paris, and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted the danger and temptation of a laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the approach of the troops was <note place="margin">They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> announced, the Caeſar went out to meet them, and aſcended his tribunal, which had been erected in a plain before the gates of the city. After diſtinguiſhing the officers and ſoldiers, who by their rank or merit deſerved a peculiar attention, Julian addreſſed himſelf in a ſtudied oration to the ſurrounding multitude: he cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated their exploits with grateful applauſe; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them to accept, with alacrity, the honour of ſerving under the eyes of a powerful and liberal monarch; and admoniſhed them, that the commands of Auguſtus required an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and cheerful obedience. The ſoldiers, who were apprehenſive of offending their general by an indecent clamour, or of belying their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by falſe and venal acclamations, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an obſtinate ſilence; and, after a ſhort pauſe, were diſmiſſed to their quarters. The principal officers were entertained by the Caeſar, who profeſſed, in the warmeſt language of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

his deſire and his inability to reward, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſerts, the brave companions of his victories. They retired from the feaſt, full of grief and perplexity; and lamented the hardſhip of their fate, which tore them from their beloved general and their native country. The only expedient which could prevent their ſeparation was boldly agitated and approved; the popular reſentment was inſenſibly moulded into a regular conſpiracy; their juſt reaſons of complaint were heightened by paſſion, and their paſſions were inflamed by wine; as on the eve of their departure, the troops were indulged in licentious feſtivity. At the hour of midnight, the impetuous multitude, with ſwords, and bowls, and torches, in their hands, ruſhed into the ſuburbs; encompaſſed the palace <note n="7" place="bottom">

careleſs of future dangers, pronounced the fatal and irrevocable words, JULIAN AUGUSTUS! The prince, whoſe anxious ſuſpence was interrupted by their diſorderly acclamations, ſecured the doors againſt their intruſion; and, as long as it was in his power, ſecluded his perſon and dignity from the accidents of a nocturnal tumult. At the dawn of day, the ſoldiers, whoſe zeal was irritated by oppoſition, forcibly entered the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, ſeized, with reſpectful violence, the object of their choice, guarded Julian with drawn ſwords through the ſtreets of Paris, placed him on the tribunal, and with repeated ſhouts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him as their emperor. Prudence, as well as loyalty, inculcated the propriety of reſiſting their treaſonable deſigns; and of preparing for his oppreſſed virtue, the excuſe of violence. Addreſſing himſelf by turns to the multitude and to individuals, he ſometimes implored their mercy, and ſometimes expreſſed his indignation; conjured them not to fully the fame of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal victories; and ventured to promiſe, that if they would immediately return to their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, he would undertake to obtain from the emperor, not only a free and gracious pardon, but even the revocation of the orders which had excited their reſentment. But the ſoldiers, who were conſcious of their guilt, choſe rather to depend on the gratitude of Julian, than on the clemency of the emperor. Their zeal was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly turned into impatience, and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience into rage. The inflexible Caeſar ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

But it is impoſſible for us to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the reſpective weight and operation of theſe ſentiments; or to aſcertain the principles of action, which might eſcape the obſervation, while they guided, or rather impelled, the ſteps of Julian himſelf. The diſcontent of the troops was produced by the malice of his enemies; their tumult was the natural effect of intereſt and of paſſion; and if Julian had tried to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal a deep deſign under the appearances of chance, he muſt have employed the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate artifice without neceſſity, and probably without ſucceſs. He ſolemnly declares, in the preſence of Jupiter, of the Sun, of Mars, of Minerva, and of all the other deities, that, till the cloſe of the evening which preceded his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he was utterly ignorant of the deſigns of the ſoldiers <note n="12" place="bottom">Julian. ad S.

Yet the ſuperſtitious confidence that Conſtantius was the enemy, and that he himſelf was the favourite, of the gods, might prompt him to deſire, to ſolicit, and even to haſten the auſpicious moment of his reign, which was predeſtined to reſtore the ancient religion of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0034700104:21"/>
mankind. When Julian had received the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the conſpiracy, he reſigned himſelf to a ſhort ſlumber; and afterwards related to his friends, that he had ſeen the Genius of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire waiting with ſome impatience at his door, preſſing for admittance, and reproaching his want of ſpirit and ambition <note n="13" place="bottom">Ammian. xx. 5. with the note of Lindenbrogius on the Genius of the empire. Julian himſelf, in a confidential letter to his friend and phyſician, Oribaſius (Epiſt. xvii. p. 384.), mentions another dream, to which, before the event, he gave credit; of a ſtately tree thrown to the ground, of a ſmall plant ſtriking a deep root into the earth. Even in his ſleep, the mind of the Caeſar muſt have been agitated by the hopes and fears of his fortune. Zoſimus (l. iii. p. 155.) relates a ſubſequent dream.</note>. Aſtoniſhed and perplexed, he addreſſed his prayers to the great Jupiter; who immediately ſignified, by a clear and manifeſt omen, that he ſhould ſubmit to the will of heaven and of the army. The conduct which diſclaims the ordinary maxims of reaſon, excites our ſuſpicion and eludes our enquiry. Whenever the ſpirit of fanaticiſm, at once ſo credulous and ſo crafty, has inſinuated itſelf into a noble mind, it inſenſibly corrodes the vital principles of virtue and veracity.</p>

But Otho had much more guilt, and much leſs abilities, than Julian.</note>, to defeat and to deſpiſe the ſecret enterpriſes which were formed againſt his life and dignity, were the cares which employed the firſt days of the reign of the new Emperor. Although he was firmly reſolved to maintain the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0034700104:22"/>
ſtation which he had aſſumed, he was ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of ſaving his country from the calamities of civil war, of declining a conteſt with the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior forces of Conſtantius, and of preſerving his own character from the reproach of perfidy and ingratitude. Adorned with the enſigns of military and Imperial pomp, Julian ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the field of Mars to the ſoldiers, who glowed with ardent enthuſiaſm in the cauſe of their pupil, their leader, and their friend. He recapitulated their victories, lamented their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, applauded their reſolution, animated their hopes, and checked their impetuoſity; nor did he diſmiſs the aſſembly, till he had obtained a ſolemn promiſe from the troops, that if the emperor of the Eaſt would ſubſcribe an equitable treaty, they would renounce any views of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ſatisfy themſelves with the tranquil poſſeſſion of the Gallic provinces. On this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation he compoſed, in his own name, and in that of the army, a ſpecious and moderate epiſtle <note n="15" place="bottom">To this oſtenſible epiſtle he added, ſays Ammianus, private letters, objurgatorias et mordaces, which the hiſtorian had not ſeen, and would not have publiſhed.

This epiſtle is inſcribed with the modeſt appellation of Caeſar; but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian ſolicits in a peremptory, though reſpectful
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0034700104:23"/>
manner, the confirmation of the title of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus. He acknowledges the irregularity of his own election, while he juſtifies, in ſome meaſure, the reſentment and violence of the troops which had extorted his reluctant conſent. He allows the ſupremacy of his brother Conſtantius; and engages to ſend him an annual preſent of Spaniſh horſes, to recruit his army with a ſelect number of Barbarian youths, and to accept from his choice a Praetorian praefect of approved diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fidelity. But he reſerves for himſelf the nomination of his other civil and military officers, with the troops, the revenue, and the ſovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps. He admoniſhes the emperor to conſult the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of juſtice; to diſtruſt the arts of thoſe venal flatterers, who ſubſiſt only by the diſcord of princes; and to embrace the offer of a fair and honourable treaty, equally advantageous to the republic, and to the houſe of Conſtantine. In this negociation Julian claimed no more than he already poſſeſſed. The delegated authority which he had long exerciſed over the provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was ſtill obeyed under a name more independent and auguſt. The ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and the people rejoiced in a revolution which was not ſtained even with the blood of the guilty. Florentius was a fugitive; Lupici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus a priſoner. The perſons who were diſaffected to the new government were diſarmed and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; and the vacant offices were diſtributed, according to the recommendation of merit, by a

The army, which Julian held in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for immediate action, was recruited and augmented by the diſorders of the times. The cruel perſecution of the faction of Magnentius had filled Gaul with numerous bands of outlaws and robbers. They cheerfully accepted the offer of a general pardon from a prince whom they could truſt, ſubmitted to the reſtraints of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſcipline, and retained only their impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable hatred to the perſon and government of Conſtantius <note n="17" place="bottom">Liban. Orat. Parent. c. 50. p. 275, 276. A ſtrange diſorder, ſince it continued above ſeven years. In the factions of the Greek republics, the exiles amounted to 20,000 perſons; and Iſocrates aſſures Philip, that it would be eaſier to raiſe an army from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds than from the cities. See Hume's Eſſays, tom. i. p. 426, 427.</note>. As ſoon as the ſeaſon of the year permitted Julian to take the field, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the head of his legions; threw a bridge over the Rhine in the neighbourhood of Cleves; and prepared to chaſtiſe the perfidy of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarii, a tribe of Franks, who preſumed that they might ravage, with impunity, the frontiers of a divided empire. The difficulty, as well as glory, of this enterprize, conſiſted in a laborious march; and Julian had conquered, as ſoon as he could penetrate into a country, which former
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0034700104:25"/>
princes had conſidered as inacceſſible. After he had given peace to the Barbarians, the emperor carefully viſited the fortifications along the Rhine from Cleves to Baſil; ſurveyed, with peculiar attention, the territories which he had recovered from the hands of the Alemanni, paſſed through Beſançon <note n="18" place="bottom">Julian (Epiſt. xxxviii. p. 414.) gives a ſhort deſcription of Veſontio, or Beſançon: a rocky peninſula almoſt encircled by the river Doux; once a magnificent city, filled with temples, &amp;c. now reduced to a ſmall town, emerging however from its ruins.</note>, which had ſeverely ſuffered from their fury, and fixed his head-quarters at Vienna for the enſuing winter. The barrier of Gaul was improved and ſtrengthened with additional fortifications; and Julian entertained ſome hopes, that the Germans, whom he had ſo often van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, might, in his abſence, be reſtrained, by the terror of his name. Vadomair <note n="19" place="bottom">Vadomair entered into the Roman ſervice, and was promoted from a Barbarian kingdom to the military rank of duke of Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia. He ſtill retained the ſame artful character (Ammian. xxi. 4.); but, under the reign of Valens, he ſignaliſed his valour in the Armenian war (xxix. 1.).</note> was the only prince of the Alemanni, whom he eſteemed or feared; and while the ſubtle Barbarian affected to obſerve the faith of treaties, the progreſs of his arms threatened the ſtate with an unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and dangerous war. The policy of Julian condeſcended to ſurpriſe the prince of the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni by his own arts; and Vadomair, who, in the character of a friend, had incautiouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted an invitation from the Roman governors, was ſeized in the midſt of the entertainment, and ſent away priſoner into the heart of Spain.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0034700104:26"/>
Before the Barbarians were recovered from their amazement, the emperor appeared in arms on the banks of the Rhine, and, once more croſſing the river, renewed the deep impreſſions of terror and reſpect which had been already made by four preceding expeditions <note n="20" place="bottom">Ammian. xx. 10. xxi. 3, 4.

            <p>The ambaſſadors of Julian had been inſtructed <note place="margin">Fruitleſs treaty and declaration of war, A.

But, in their paſſage through Italy and Illyricum, they were detained by the tedious and affected delays of the provincial go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors; they were conducted by ſlow journies from Conſtantinople to Caeſarea in Cappadocia; and when at length they were admitted to the preſence of Conſtantius, they found that he had already conceived, from the diſpatches of his own officers, the moſt unfavourable opinion of the conduct of Julian, and of the Gallic army. The letters were heard with impatience; the trembling meſſengers were diſmiſſed with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and contempt; and the looks, the geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the furious language of the monarch, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the diſorder of his ſoul. The domeſtic connection, which might have reconciled the brother and the huſband of Helena, was recently diſſolved by the death of that princeſs, whoſe pregnancy had been ſeveral times fruitleſs, and was at laſt fatal to herſelf <note n="21" place="bottom">Her remains were ſent to Rome, and interred near thoſe of her ſiſter Conſtantina, in the ſuburb of the <hi>Via Nomentana.</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian. xxi. 1.

The empreſs Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebia
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0034700104:27"/>
had preſerved to the laſt moment of her life the warm, and even jealous, affection which ſhe had conceived for Julian; and her mild in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence might have moderated the reſentment of a prince, who, ſince her death, was abandoned to his own paſſions, and to the arts of his eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs. But the terror of a foreign invaſion obliged him to ſuſpend the puniſhment of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate enemy; he continued his march towards the confines of Perſia, and thought it ſufficient to ſignify the conditions which might entitle Julian and his guilty followers to the clemency of their offended ſovereign. He required, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Caeſar ſhould expreſsly renounce the appellation and rank of Auguſtus, which he had accepted from the rebels; that he ſhould deſcend to his former ſtation of a limited and dependent miniſter; that he ſhould veſt the powers of the ſtate and army in the hands of thoſe officers who were appointed by the Imperial court; and that he ſhould truſt his ſafety to the aſſurances of pardon, which were announced by Epictetus, a Gallic biſhop, and one of the Arian favourites of Conſtantius. Several months were ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually conſumed in a treaty which was negociated at the diſtance of three thouſand miles between
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0034700104:28"/>
Paris and Antioch; and, as ſoon as Julian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that his moderate and reſpectful behaviour ſerved only to irritate the pride of an implacable adverſary, he boldly reſolved to commit his life and fortune to the chance of a civil war. He gave a public and military audience to the quaeſtor Leonas: the haughty epiſtle of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius was read to the attentive multitude; and Julian proteſted, with the moſt flattering defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that he was ready to reſign the title of Auguſtus, if he could obtain the conſent of thoſe whom he acknowledged as the authors of his elevation. The ſaint propoſal was impetuouſly ſilenced; and the acclamations of <q>Julian Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, continue to reign, by the authority of the army, of the people, of the republic, which you have ſaved,</q> thundred at once from every part of the field, and terrified the pale ambaſſador of Conſtantius. A part of the letter was afterwards read, in which the emperor arraigned the ingratitude of Julian, whom he had inveſted with the honours of the purple; whom he had educated with ſo much care and tenderneſs; whom he had preſerved in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, when he was left a helpleſs orphan; <q>an orphan!</q> interrupted Julian, who juſtified his cauſe by indulging his paſſions: <q>Does the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin of my family reproach me that I was left an orphan? He urges me to revenge thoſe injuries, which I have long ſtudied to forget.</q> The aſſembly was diſmiſſed; and Leonas, who, with ſome difficulty, had been
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0034700104:29"/>
protected from the popular fury, was ſent back to his maſter, with an epiſtle, in which Julian expreſſed, in a ſtrain of the moſt vehement elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the ſentiments of contempt, of hatred, and of reſentment, which had been ſuppreſſed and embittered by the diſſimulation of twenty years. After this meſſage, which might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a ſignal of irreconcilable war, Julian, who, ſome weeks before, had celebrated the Chriſtian feſtival of the Epiphany, <note n="22" place="bottom">Feriarum die quem celebrantes menſe Januario, Chriſtiani <hi>Epiphania</hi> dictitant, progreſſus in eorum eccleſiam, ſolemniter numine orato diſceſſit.

            <p>The ſituation of Julian required a vigorous <note place="margin">Julian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to attack Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> and immediate reſolution. He had diſcovered, from intercepted letters, that his adverſary, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing the intereſt of the ſtate to that of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0034700104:30"/>
monarch, had again excited the Barbarians to invade the provinces of the Weſt. The poſition of two magazines, one of them collected on the banks of the lake of Conſtance, the other formed at the foot of the Cottian Alps, ſeemed to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the march of two armies; and the ſize of thoſe magazines, each of which conſiſted of ſix hundred thouſand quarters of wheat, or rather flour, <note n="24" place="bottom">Three hundred myriads, or three millions of <hi>medimni,</hi> a corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſure familiar to the Athenians, and which contained ſix Roman <hi>modii.</hi> Julian explains, like a ſoldier and a ſtateſman, the danger of his ſituation, and the neceſſity and advantages of an offenſive war (ad S. P. Q. Athen. p. 286, 287.).</note> was a threatening evidence of the ſtrength and numbers of the enemy, who prepared to ſurround him. But the Imperial legions were ſtill in their diſtant quarters of Aſia; the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube was feebly guarded; and if Julian could occupy, by a ſudden incurſion, the important provinces of Illyricum, he might expect that a people of ſoldiers would reſort to his ſtandard, and that the rich mines of gold and ſilver would contribute to the expences of the civil war. He propoſed this bold enterpriſe to the aſſembly of the ſoldiers; inſpired them with a juſt confidence in their general, and in themſelves; and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to maintain their reputation, of being terrible to the enemy, moderate to their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizens, and obedient to their officers. His ſpirited diſcourſe was received with the loudeſt acclamations, and the ſame troops which had taken up arms againſt Conſtantius, when he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned them to leave Gaul, now declared with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0034700104:31"/>
alacrity, that they would follow Julian to the fartheſt extremities of Europe or Aſia. The oath of fidelity was adminiſtered; and the ſoldiers, claſhing their ſhields, and pointing their drawn ſwords to their throats, devoted themſelves, with horrid imprecations, to the ſervice of a leader whom they celebrated as the deliverer of Gaul, and the conqueror of the Germans <note n="25" place="bottom">See his oration, and the behaviour of the troops, in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian. xxi. 5.</note>. This ſolemn engagement, which ſeemed to be dictated by affection, rather than by duty, was ſingly oppoſed by Nebridius, who had been admitted to the office of Praetorian praefect. That faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miniſter, alone and unaſſiſted, aſſerted the rights of Conſtantius in the midſt of an armed and angry multitude, to whoſe fury he had almoſt fallen an honourable, but uſeleſs, ſacrifice. After loſing one of his hands by the ſtroke of a ſword, he embraced the knees of the prince whom he had offended. Julian covered the praefect with his Imperial mantle, and protecting him from the zeal of his followers, diſmiſſed him to his own houſe, with leſs reſpect than was perhaps due to the virtue of an enemy <note n="26" place="bottom">He ſternly refuſed his hand to the ſuppliant praefect, whom he ſent into Tuſcany (Ammian. xxi. 5.). Libanius, with ſavage fury, inſults Nebridius, applauds the ſoldiers, and almoſt cenſures the humanity of Julian (Orat. Parent. c. 53. p. 278.).</note>. The high office of Nebridius was beſtowed on Salluſt; and the provinces of Gaul, which were now delivered from the intolerable oppreſſion of taxes, enjoyed the mild and equitable adminiſtration of the friend of Julian, who was permitted to practiſe thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0034700104:32"/>
virtues which he had inſtilled into the mind of his pupil <note n="27" place="bottom">Ammian. xxi. 8. In this promotion, Julian obeyed the law which he publicly impoſed on himſelf. Neque civilis quiſquam judex nec militaris rector, alio quodam praeter merita ſuffragante, ad potiorum veniat gradum (Ammian. xx. 5.). Abſence did not weaken his regard for Salluſt, with whoſe name (A. D. 363.) he honoured the conſulſhip.</note>.</p>
            <p>The hopes of Julian depended much leſs on <note place="margin">His march from the Rhine into Illyricum.</note> the number of his troops, than on the celerity of his motions. In the execution of a daring en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, he availed himſelf of every precaution, as far as prudence could ſuggeſt; and where prudence could no longer accompany his ſteps, he truſted the event to valour and to fortune. In the neighbourhood of Baſil he aſſembled and divided his army <note n="28" place="bottom">Ammianus (xxi. 8.) aſcribes the ſame practice, and the ſame motive, to Alexander the Groat, and other ſkilful generals.</note>. One body, which conſiſted of ten thouſand men, was directed, under the command of Nevitta, general of the cavalry, to advance through the midland parts of Rhaetia and Noricum. A ſimilar diviſion of troops, under the orders of Jovius and Jovinus, prepared to follow the oblique courſe of the highways, through the Alps and the northern confines of Italy. The inſtructions to the generals were conceived with energy and preciſion: to haſten their march in cloſe and compact columns, which, according to the diſpoſition of the ground, might readily be changed into any order of battle; to ſecure themſelves againſt the ſurpriſes of the night by ſtrong poſts and vigilant guards; to prevent reſiſtance by their unexpected arrival; to elude
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0034700104:33"/>
examination by their ſudden departure; to ſpread the opinion of their ſtrength, and the terror of his name; and to join their ſovereign under the walls of Sirmium. For himſelf, Julian had reſerved a more difficult and extraordinary part. He ſelected three thouſand brave and active volunteers, reſolved, like their leader, to caſt behind them every hope of a retreat: at the head of this faithful band, he fearleſsly plunged into the receſſes of the Marcian, or black foreſt, which conceals the ſources of the Danube <note n="29" place="bottom">This wood was a part of the great Hercynian foreſt, which, in the time of Caeſar, ſtretched away from the country of the Rau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raci (Baſil) into the boundleſs regions of the North. See Cluver. Germania Antiqua, l. iii. c. 47.</note>; and, for many days, the fate of Julian was unknown to the world. The ſecrecy of his march, his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and vigour, ſurmounted every obſtacle; he forced his way over mountains and moraſſes, occupied the bridges or ſwam the rivers, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his direct courſe <note n="30" place="bottom">Compare Libanius, Orat. Parent. c. 53. p. 278, 279, with Gregory Nazianzen, Orat. iii. p. 68. Even the ſaint admires the ſpeed and ſecrecy of this march. A modern divine might apply to the progreſs of Julian, the lines which were originally deſigned for another apoſtate:
<l>—So eagerly the fiend,</l>
                  <l>O'er bog, or ſteep, through ſtrait, rough, denſe, or rare,</l>

                  <l>And ſwims, or ſinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.</l>
               </note>, without reflecting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he traverſed the territory of the Romans or of the Barbarians, and at length emerged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Ratiſbon and Vienna, at the place where he deſigned to embark his troops on the Danube. By a well-concerted ſtratagem, he ſeized a fleet

of light brigantines <note n="31" place="bottom">In that interval the <hi>Notitia</hi> places two or three fleets, the Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacenſis (at Lauriacum, or Lorch), the Arlapenſis, the Maginenſis; and mentions five legions, or cohorts, of Liburnarii, who ſhould be a ſort of marines.

The labours of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, who plied their oars with inceſſant dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and the ſteady continuance of a favourable wind, carried his fleet above ſeven hundred miles in eleven days <note n="32" place="bottom">Zoſimus alone (l. iii. p. 156.) has ſpecified this intereſting circumſtance. Mamertinus (in Panegyr. Vet. xi. 6, 7, 8.), who accompanied Julian, as count of the ſacred largeſſes, deſcribes this voyage in a florid and pictoreſque manner, challenges Triptolemus and the Argonauts of Greece, &amp;c.</note>; and he had already diſembarked his troops at Bononia, only nineteen miles from Sirmium, before his enemies could receive any certain intelligence that he had left the banks of the Rhine. In the courſe of this long and rapid navigation, the mind of Julian was fixed on the object of his enterpriſe; and though he accepted the deputation of ſome cities, which haſtened to claim the merit of an early ſubmiſſion, he paſſed before the hoſtile ſtations, which were placed along the river, without indulging the temptation of ſignalizing an uſeleſs and ill-timed valour. The banks of the Danube were crowded on either ſide with ſpectators, who gazed on the military pomp, anticipated the importance of the event, and diffuſed through the adjacent country the ſame of a young hero, who advanced with more
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0034700104:35"/>
than mortal ſpeed at the head of the innumerable forces of the Weſt. Lucilian, who, with the rank of general of the cavalry, commanded the military powers of Illyricum, was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful reports, which he could neither reject nor believe. He had taken ſome ſlow and irreſolute meaſures for the purpoſe of collecting his troops; when he was ſurpriſed by Dagalaiphus, an active officer, whom Julian, as ſoon as he landed at Bononia, had puſhed forwards with ſome light infantry. The captive general, uncertain of his life or death, was haſtily thrown upon a horſe, and conducted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Julian; who kindly raiſed him from the ground, and diſpelled the terror and amazement which ſeemed to ſtupify his faculties. But Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian had no ſooner recovered his ſpirits, than he betrayed his want of diſcretion, by preſuming to admoniſh his conqueror, that he had raſhly ventured, with a handful of men, to expoſe his perſon in the midſt of his enemies. <q>Reſerve for your maſter Conſtantius theſe timid remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, replied Julian, with a ſmile of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; when I gave you my purple to kiſs, I received you not as a counſellor, but as a ſuppliant.</q> Conſcious that ſucceſs alone could juſtify his attempt, and that boldneſs only could command ſucceſs, he inſtantly advanced, at the head of three thouſand ſoldiers, to attack the ſtrongeſt and moſt populous city of the Illyrian provinces. As he entered the long ſuburb of Sirmium, he was received by the joyful accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the army and people; who, crowned
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0034700104:36"/>
with flowers, and holding lighted tapers in their hands, conducted their acknowledged ſovereign to his Imperial reſidence. Two days were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the public joy, which was celebrated by the games of the Circus; but, early on the morning of the third day, Julian marched to occupy the narrow paſs of Succi, in the defiles of Mount Haemus; which, almoſt in the mid-way between Sirmium and Conſtantinople, ſeparates the provinces of Thrace and Dacia, by an abrupt deſcent towards the former, and a gentle decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity on the ſide of the latter <note n="33" place="bottom">The deſcription of Ammianus, which might be ſupported by collateral evidence, aſcertains the preciſe ſituation of the <hi>Anguſtiae Succorum,</hi> or paſſes of <hi>Succi.</hi> M. d'Anville, from the trifling reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of names, has placed them between Sardica and Naiſſus.

The defence of this important poſt was entruſted to the brave Nevitta; who, as well as the generals of the Italian diviſion, ſucceſsfully executed the plan of the march and junction which their maſter had ſo ably conceived <note n="34" place="bottom">Whatever circumſtances we may borrow elſewhere, Ammia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus (xxi. 8, 9, 10.) ſtill ſupplies the ſeries of the narrative.</note>.</p>
            <p>The homage which Julian obtained, from the <note place="margin">He juſtifies his cauſe.</note> fears or the inclination of the people, extended far beyond the immediate effect of his arms <note n="35" place="bottom">Ammian. xxi. 9, 10.

with precipitation to the court of Aſia, Julian, who could not always reſtrain the levity of his temper, ſtigmatized their flight by adding, in all the Acts of the Year, the epithet of <hi>fugitive</hi> to the names of the two conſuls. The provinces which had been deſerted by their firſt magiſtrates acknowledged the authority of an emperor, who, conciliating the qualities of a ſoldier with thoſe of a philoſopher, was equally admired in the camps of the Danube, and in the cities of Greece. From his palace, or, more properly, from his head-quarters of Sirmium and Naiſſus, he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the principal cities of the empire, a laboured apology for his own conduct; publiſhed the ſecret diſpatches of Conſtantius; and ſolicited the judgment of mankind between two compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors, the one of whom had expelled, and the other had invited, the Barbarians <note n="36" place="bottom">Julian (ad S.

Athen. p. 286.) poſitively aſſerts, that he intercepted the letters of Conſtantius to the Barbarians: and Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius as poſitively affirms, that he read them on his march to the troops and the cities. Yet Ammianus (xxi. 4.) expreſſes himſelf with cool and candid heſitation, ſi <hi>famae ſolius</hi> admittenda eſt fides. He ſpecifies, however, an intercepted letter from Vadomair to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius, which ſuppoſes an intimate correſpondence between them: "Caeſar tuus diſciplinam non habet."</note>. Julian, whoſe mind was deeply wounded by the reproach of ingratitude, aſpired to maintain, by argument as well as by arms, the ſuperior merits of his cauſe; and to excel, not only in the arts of war, but in thoſe of compoſition. His epiſtle to the ſenate and people of Athens <note n="37" place="bottom">Zoſimus mentions his epiſtles to the Athenians, the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, and the Lacedaemonians.

dictated by an elegant enthuſiaſm; which prompted him to ſubmit his actions and his motives to the degenerate Athenians of his own times, with the ſame humble deference, as if he had been plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the days of Ariſtides, before the tribunal of the Areopagus. His application to the ſenate of Rome, which was ſtill permitted to beſtow the titles of Imperial power, was agreeable to the forms of the expiring republic. An aſſembly was ſummoned by Tertullus, praefect of the city; the epiſtle of Julian was read; and as he appeared to be maſter of Italy, his claims were admitted without a diſſenting voice. His oblique cenſure of the innovations of Conſtantine, and his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate invective againſt the vices of Conſtantius, were heard with leſs ſatisfaction; and the ſenate, as if Julian had been preſent, unanimouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, <q>Reſpect, we beſeech you, the author of your own fortune <note n="38" place="bottom">

The intelligence of the march and rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Julian was ſpeedily tranſmitted to his rival, who, by the retreat of Sapor, had obtained <note place="margin">Hoſtile preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</note> ſome reſpite from the Perſian war. Diſguiſing the anguiſh of his ſoul under the ſemblance of contempt, Conſtantius profeſſed his intention of returning into Europe, and of giving chace to Julian; for he never ſpoke of this military expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in any other light than that of a hunting party <note n="39" place="bottom">Tanquam venaticiam praedam caperet: hoc enim ad leniendum ſuorum metum ſubinde praedicabat. Ammian. xxi. 7.</note>. In the camp of Hierapolis, in Syria, he communicated this deſign to his army; ſlightly mentioned the guilt and raſhneſs of the Caeſar; and ventured to aſſure them, that if the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers of Gaul preſumed to meet them in the field, they would be unable to ſuſtain the fire of their eyes, and the irreſiſtible weight of their ſhout of onſet. The ſpeech of the emperor was received with military applauſe, and Theodotus, the preſident of the council of Hierapolis, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, with tears of adulation, that <hi>his</hi> city might be adorned with the head of the vanquiſhed rebel <note n="40" place="bottom">See the ſpeech and preparations in Ammianus, xxi. 13.

A choſen detachment was diſpatched away in poſt-waggons, to ſecure, if it were yet poſſible, the paſs of Succi; the recruits, the horſes, the arms, and the magazines which had been prepared againſt Sapor, were appropriated to the ſervice of the civil war; and the domeſtic
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0034700104:40"/>
victories of Conſtantius inſpired his partiſans with the moſt ſanguine aſſurances of ſucceſs. The notary Gaudentius had occupied in his name the provinces of Africa; the ſubſiſtence of Rome was intercepted; and the diſtreſs of Julian was increaſed, by an unexpected event, which might have been productive of fatal conſequences. Julian had received the ſubmiſſion of two legions and a cohort of archers, who were ſtationed at Sirmium; but he ſuſpected, with reaſon, the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of thoſe troops, which had been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the emperor; and it was thought expedient, under the pretence of the expoſed ſtate of the Gallic frontier, to diſmiſs them from the moſt important ſcene of action. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, with reluctance, as far as the confines of Italy; but as they dreaded the length of the way, and the ſavage fierceneſs of the Germans, they reſolved, by the inſtigation of one of their tribunes, to halt at Aquileia, and to erect the banners of Conſtantius on the walls of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable city. The vigilance of Julian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at once the extent of the miſchief, and the neceſſity of applying an immediate remedy. By his order, Jovinus led back a part of the army into Italy; and the ſiege of Aquileia was formed with diligence, and proſecuted with vigour. But the legionaries, who ſeemed to have rejected the yoke of diſcipline, conducted the defence of the place with ſkill and perſeverance; invited the reſt of Italy to imitate the example of their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and loyalty; and threatened the retreat of

Julian, if he ſhould be forced to yield to the ſuperior numbers of the armies of the Eaſt <note n="41" place="bottom">Ammian. xxi. 7. 11, 12. He ſeems to deſcribe, with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous labour, the operations of the ſiege of Aquileia, which, on this occaſion, maintained its impregnable fame. Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen (Orat. iii. p. 68.) aſcribes this accidental revolt to the wiſdom of Conſtantius, whoſe aſſured victory he announces with ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of truth.

            <p>But the humanity of Julian was preſerved from the cruel alternative, which he pathetically la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">and death of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius, A.

The approach of winter could not detain the monarch at Antioch; and his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites durſt not oppoſe his impatient deſire of revenge. A ſlight fever, which was perhaps occaſioned by the agitation of his ſpirits, was encreaſed by the fatigues of the journey; and Conſtantius was obliged to halt at the little town of Mopſucrene, twelve miles beyond Tarſus, where he expired, after a ſhort illneſs, in the forty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty-fourth of his reign <note n="42" place="bottom">His death and character are faithfully delineated by Ammia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus (xxi. 14, 15, 16.); and we are authoriſed to deſpiſe and deteſt the fooliſh calumny of Gregory (Orat. iii. p. 68.), who accuſes Julian of contriving the death of his benefactor. The private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of the emperor, that he had ſpared and promoted Julian (p. 69. and Orat. xxi. p. 389.), is not improbable in itſelf, nor incompatible with the public verbal teſtament, which prudential conſiderations might dictate in the laſt moments of his life.</note>. His genuine character, which was compoſed of pride and weakneſs, of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and cruelty, has been fully diſplayed in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0034700104:42"/>
the preceding narrative of civil and eccleſiaſtical events. The long abuſe of power rendered him a conſiderable object in the eyes of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries; but as perſonal merit can alone deſerve the notice of poſterity, the laſt of the ſons of Conſtantine may be diſmiſſed from the world with the remark, that he inherited the defects, without the abilities, of his father. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conſtantius expired, he is ſaid to have named Julian for his ſucceſſor; nor does it ſeem impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that his anxious concern for the fate of a young and tender wife, whom he left with child, may have prevailed, in his laſt moments, over the harſher paſſions of hatred and revenge. Euſebius, and his guilty aſſociates, made a faint attempt to prolong the reign of the eunuchs, by the election of another emperor: but their intrigues were rejected with diſdain by an army which now abhorred the thought of civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; and two officers of rank were inſtantly diſpatched, to aſſure Julian, that every ſword in the empire would be drawn for his ſervice. The military deſigns of that prince, who had formed three different attacks againſt Thrace, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by this fortunate event. Without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the blood of his fellow-citizens, he eſcaped the dangers of a doubtful conflict, and acquired the advantages of a complete victory. Impatient to viſit the place of his birth, and the new capital of the empire, he advanced from Naiſſus through the mountains of Haemus, and the cities of Thrace. When he reached Heraclea, at the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0034700104:43"/>
diſtance of ſixty miles, all Conſtantinople was poured forth to receive him; and he made his triumphal entry, amidſt the dutiful acclamations <note place="margin">Julian en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Dec. 11.</note> of the ſoldiers, the people, and the ſenate. An innumerable multitude preſſed around him with eager reſpect; and were perhaps diſappointed when they beheld the ſmall ſtature, and ſimple garb, of a hero, whoſe unexperienced youth had vanquiſhed the Barbarians of Germany, and who had now traverſed, in a ſucceſsful career, the whole continent of Europe, from the ſhores of the Atlantic to thoſe of the Boſphorus. <note n="43" place="bottom">In deſcribing the triumph of Julian, Ammianus (xxii. 1, 2.) aſſumes the lofty tone of an orator or poet; while Libanius (Orat.

            <p>Philoſophy had inſtructed Julian to compare <note place="margin">His civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and private life.</note> the advantages of action and retirement; but the elevation of his birth, and the accidents of his life, never allowed him the freedom of choice. He might perhaps ſincerely have preferred the groves of the academy, and the ſociety of Athens; but he was conſtrained, at firſt by the will, and afterwards by the injuſtice, of Conſtantius, to expoſe his perſon and fame to the dangers of Imperial greatneſs; and to make himſelf account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the world, and to poſterity, for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of millions. <note n="46" place="bottom">Julian himſelf (p. 253—267.) has expreſſed theſe philoſophical ideas, with much eloquence, and ſome affectation, in a very elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate epiſtle to Themiſtius.

The throne of Julian, which the death of Conſtantius fixed on an independent baſis, was the ſeat of reaſon, of virtue, and perhaps of vanity. He deſpiſed the honours, renounced the pleaſures, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with inceſſant diligence the duties, of his exalted ſtation; and there were few among his ſubjects who would have conſented to relieve him from the weight of the diadem, had they been obliged to ſubmit their time and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the rigorous laws which their philoſophic emperor impoſed on himſelf. One of his moſt intimate friends, <note n="49" place="bottom">Libanius (Orat. Parentalis, c. lxxxiv. lxxxv. p. 310, 311, 312.) has given this intereſting detail of the private life of Julian. He himſelf (in Miſopogon, p. 350.) mentions his vegetable diet, and upbraids the groſs and ſenſual appetite of the people of Antioch.</note> who had often ſhared the frugal ſimplicity of his table, has remarked, that his light and ſparing diet (which was uſually of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0034700104:46"/>
the vegetable kind) left his mind and body always free and active, for the various and important buſineſs of an author, a pontiff, a magiſtrate, a general, and a prince. In one and the ſame day, he gave audience to ſeveral ambaſſadors, and wrote, or dictated, a great number of letters to his generals, his civil magiſtrates, his private friends, and the different cities of his dominions. He liſtened to the memorials which had been received, conſidered the ſubject of the petitions, and ſignified his intentions more rapidly than they could be taken in ſhort-hand by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his ſecretaries. He poſſeſſed ſuch flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibility of thought, and ſuch firmneſs of attention, that he could employ his hand to write, his ear to liſten, and his voice to dictate; and purſue at once three ſeveral trains of ideas, without heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and without error. While his miniſters repoſed, the prince flew with agility from one labour to another, and, after a haſty dinner, retired into his library, till the public buſineſs, which he had appointed for the evening, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned him to interrupt the proſecution of his ſtudies. The ſupper of the emperor was ſtill leſs ſubſtantial than the former meal; his ſleep was never clouded by the fumes of indigeſtion; and, except in the ſhort interval of a marriage, which was the effect of policy rather than love, the chaſte Julian never ſhared his bed with a female companion. <note n="50" place="bottom">Lectulus . . .

The predeceſſors of Julian, his uncle, his brother, and his couſin, indulged their puerile taſte for the games of the circus, under the ſpecious pretence of complying with the inclinations of the people; and they frequently remained the greateſt part of the day, as idle ſpectators, and as a part of the ſplendid ſpectacle, till the ordinary round of twenty-four races <note n="51" place="bottom">

The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch who reſigned to his ſubjects the ſuperiority of merit and virtue, was diſtinguiſhed by the oppreſſive magnificence of his dreſs, his table, his buildings, and his train. The ſtately palaces erected by Conſtantine and his ſons, were deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with many coloured marbles, and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of maſſy gold. The moſt exquiſite dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were procured, to gratify their pride, rather than their taſte; birds of the moſt diſtant cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, fiſh from the moſt remote ſeas, fruits out of their natural ſeaſon, winter roſes, and ſummer ſnows <note n="56" place="bottom">The expreſſions of Mamertinus are lively and forcible.

The monarch was diſgraced, and the people was injured, by the creation and ſale of an infinite number of obſcure, and even titular employments; and the moſt worthleſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind might purchaſe the privilege of being maintained, without the neceſſity of labour, from the public revenue. The waſte of an enormous houſehold, the encreaſe of fees and perquiſites, which were ſoon claimed as a lawful debt, and the bribes which they extorted from thoſe who feared their enmity, or ſolicited their favour, ſuddenly enriched theſe haughty menials. They abuſed their fortune, without conſidering their paſt, or their future, condition; and their rapine and venality could be equalled only by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance of their diſſipations. Their ſilken robes were embroidered with gold, their tables were ſerved with delicacy and profuſion; the houſes which they built for their own uſe, would have covered the farm of an ancient conſul; and the moſt honourable citizens were obliged to diſmount from their horſes, and reſpectfully to ſalute an eunuch whom they met on the public highway. The luxury of the palace excited the contempt and indignation of Julian, who uſually ſlept on the ground, who yielded with reluctance
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0034700104:51"/>
to the indiſpenſable calls of nature; and who placed his vanity, not in emulating, but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing, the pomp of royalty. By the total ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of a miſchief which was magnified even beyond its real extent, he was impatient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the diſtreſs, and to appeaſe the murmurs, of the people; who ſupport with leſs uneaſineſs the weight of taxes, if they are convinced that the fruits of their induſtry are appropriated to the ſervice of the ſtate. But in the execution of this ſalutary work, Julian is accuſed of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with too much haſte and inconſiderate ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. By a ſingle edict, he reduced the palace of Conſtantinople to an immenſe deſert, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed with ignominy the whole train of ſlaves and dependents <note n="57" place="bottom">Yet Julian himſelf was accuſed of beſtowing whole towns on the eunuchs (Orat. vii. againſt Polyclet. p. 117—127.). Libanius contents himſelf with a cold but poſitive denial of the fact, which ſeems indeed to belong more properly to Conſtantius. This charge, however, may allude to ſome unknown circumſtance.</note>, without providing any juſt, or at leaſt benevolent, exceptions, for the age, the ſervices, or the poverty, of the faithful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics of the Imperial family. Such indeed was the temper of Julian, who ſeldom recollected the fundamental maxim of Ariſtotle, that true virtue is placed at an equal diſtance between the oppoſite vices. The ſplendid and effeminate dreſs of the Aſiatics, the curls and paint, the collars and bracelets, which had appeared ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous in the perſon of Conſtantine, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently rejected by his philoſophic ſucceſſor.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0034700104:52"/>
But with the ſopperies, Julian affected to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the decencies, of dreſs; and ſeemed to value himſelf for his neglect of the laws of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. In a ſatirical performance, which was deſigned for the public eye, the emperor deſcants with pleaſure, and even with pride, on the length of his nails, and the inky blackneſs of his hands; proteſts, that although the greateſt part of his body was covered with hair, the uſe of the razor was confined to his head alone; and celebrates, with viſible complacency, the ſhaggy and <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0034700104:57"/>
or illegally beſtowed; he foreſaw the endleſs proſecution of vexatious ſuits; and he engaged a promiſe, which ought always to have been ſacred, that if they would repair to Chalcedon, he would meet them in perſon, to hear and determine their complaints. But as ſoon as they were landed, he iſſued an abſolute order, which prohibited the watermen from tranſporting any Egyptian to Conſtantinople; and thus detained his diſappointed clients on the Aſiatic ſhore, till their patience and money being utterly exhauſted, they were obliged to return with indignant mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs to their native country. <note n="67" place="bottom">See Ammian. xxii. 6. and Valeſ. ad locum; and the Codex Theodoſianus, l. ii. tit. xxxix. leg. 1.; and Godefroy's Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, tom. i. p. 218, ad locum.</note>.</p>

Julian was ſlow in his ſuſpicions, and gentle in his puniſhments; and his contempt of treaſon was the reſult of judgment, of vanity, and of courage. Conſcious of ſuperior merit, he was perſuaded that few among his ſubjects would dare, to meet him in the field, to attempt his life, or even to ſeat themſelves on his vacant throne. The philoſopher could excuſe the haſty ſallies of diſcontent; and the hero could deſpiſe the ambitious projects, which ſurpaſſed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or the abilities of the raſh conſpirators.

The monarch, after mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome inquiry into the rank and character of his rival, diſpatched the informer with a preſent of a pair of purple ſlippers, to complete the magnificence of his Imperial habit. A more dangerous conſpiracy was formed by ten of the domeſtic guards, who had reſolved to aſſaſſinate Julian in the field of exerciſe near Antioch. Their intemperance revealed their guilt; and they were conducted in chains to the preſence of their injured ſovereign, who, after a lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the wickedneſs and folly of their enterpriſe, inſtead of a death of torture, which they deſerved and expected, pronounced a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of exile againſt the two principal offenders.

Libanius (Orat. Parent. c. 90, 91. p. 315, &amp;c.) has ſeen only the fair ſide, and his picture, if it flatters the perſon, expreſſes at leaſt the duties, of the Judge. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen (Orat. iv. p. 120.), who ſuppreſſes the virtues, and exaggerates even the venial faults, of the apoſtate; triumphantly aſks, Whether ſuch a judge was fit to be ſeated between Minos and Rhadamanthus, in the Elyſian fields?</note>, which are almoſt unknown to the modern ſovereigns of Europe. The arts of perſuaſion, ſo diligently cultivated by the firſt Caeſars, were neglected by the military ignorance and Aſiatic pride of their ſucceſſors; and if they condeſcended to harangue the ſoldiers, whom they feared, they treated with ſilent diſdain the ſenators, whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed. The aſſemblies of the ſenate, which Conſtantius had avoided, were conſidered by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian as the place where he could exhibit, with the moſt propriety, the maxims of a republican,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0034700104:65"/>
and the talents of a rhetorician. He alternately practiſed, as in a ſchool of declamation, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral modes of praiſe, of cenſure, of exhortation; and his friend Libanius has remarked, that the ſtudy of Homer taught him to imitate the ſimple, conciſe ſtyle of Menelaus, the copiouſneſs of Neſtor, whoſe words deſcended like the flakes of a winter's ſnow, or the pathetic and forcible eloquence of Ulyſſes. The functions of a judge, which are ſometimes incompatible with thoſe of a prince, were exerciſed by Julian, not only as a duty, but as an amuſement; and although he might have truſted the integrity and diſcernment of his Praetorian prefects, he often placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by their ſide on the ſeat of judgment. The acute penetration of his mind was agreeably oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in detecting and defeating the chicanery of the advocates, who laboured to diſguiſe the truth of facts, and to pervert the ſenſe of the laws. He ſometimes forgot the gravity of his ſtation, aſked indiſcreet or unſeaſonable queſtions, and betrayed, by the loudneſs of his voice, and the agitation of his body, the earneſt vehemence with which he maintained his opinion againſt the judges, the advocates, and their clients. But his knowledge of his own temper prompted him to encourage, and even to ſolicit, the reproof of his friends and miniſters; and whenever they ventured to oppoſe the irregular ſallies of his paſſions, the ſpectators could obſerve the ſhame, as well as the gratitude, of their monarch. The decrees of Julian were almoſt always founded on
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0034700104:66"/>
the principles of juſtice; and he had the firmneſs to reſiſt the two moſt dangerous temptations, which aſſault the tribunal of a ſovereign, under the ſpecious forms of compaſſion and equity. He decided the merits of the cauſe without weighing the circumſtances of the parties; and the poor, whom he wiſhed to relieve, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to ſatisfy the juſt demands of a noble and wealthy adverſary. He carefully diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the judge from the legiſlator <note n="84" place="bottom">Of the laws which Julian enacted in a reign of ſixteen months, fifty-four have been admitted into the Codes of Theodoſius and Juſtinian.

But the perſonal merit of Julian was, in ſome meaſure, independent of his fortune. Whatever had been his choice of life; by the force of intrepid courage, lively wit, and intenſe application, he would have obtained, or at leaſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0034700104:67"/>
he would have deſerved, the higheſt honours of his profeſſion; and Julian might have raiſed himſelf to the rank of miniſter, or general, of the ſtate in which he was born a private citizen. If the jealous caprice of power had diſappointed his expectations; if he had prudently declined the paths of greatneſs, the employment of the ſame talents in ſtudious ſolitude, would have placed, beyond the reach of kings, his preſent happineſs and his immortal fame. When we inſpect, with minute, or perhaps malevolent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, the portrait of Julian, ſomething ſeems wanting to the grace and perfection of the whole figure. His genius was leſs powerful and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime than that of Caeſar; nor did he poſſeſs the conſummate prudence of Auguſtus. The virtues of Trajan appear more ſteady and natural, and the philoſophy of Marcus is more ſimple and conſiſtent. Yet Julian ſuſtained adverſity with firmneſs, and proſperity with moderation. After an interval of one hundred and twenty years from the death of Alexander Severus, the Romans beheld an emperor who made no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his duties and his pleaſures; who laboured to relieve the diſtreſs, and to revive the ſpirit, of his ſubjects; and who endeavoured always to connect authority with merit, and happineſs with virtue. Even faction, and religious faction, was conſtrained to acknowledge the ſuperiority of his genius, in peace as well as in war; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, with a ſigh, that the apoſtate Julian was a

            <p>THE character of Apoſtate has injured the reputation of Julian; and the enthuſiaſm which clouded his virtues, has exaggerated the <note place="margin">Religion of Julian.</note> real and apparent magnitude of his faults. Our partial ignorance may repreſent him as a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic monarch, who ſtudied to protect, with an equal hand, the religious factions of the empire; and to allay the theological fever which had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed the minds of the people, from the edicts of Diocletian to the exile of Athanaſius. A more accurate view of the character and conduct of Julian, will remove this favourable prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a prince who did not eſcape the general contagion of the times. We enjoy the ſingular advantage of comparing the pictures which have been delineated by his fondeſt admirers, and his implacable enemies. The actions of Julian are faithfully related by a judicious and candid hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, the impartial ſpectator of his life and death. The unanimous evidence of his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries is confirmed by the public and private declarations of the emperor himſelf; and his

The fierce conteſts of the Eaſtern biſhops, the inceſſant alterations of their creeds, and the profane motives which appeared to actuate their conduct, inſenſibly ſtrengthened the prejudice of Julian, that they neither underſtood nor believed the religion for which they ſo fiercely contended. Inſtead of liſtening to the proofs of Chriſtianity with that favourable attention which adds weight to the moſt reſpectable evidence, he heard with ſuſpicion, and diſputed with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and acuteneſs, the doctrines for which he already entertained an invincible averſion.

In the age of Julian, every circumſtance contributed to prolong and fortify the illuſion; the magnificent temples of Greece and Aſia; the works of thoſe artiſts who had expreſſed, in painting or in ſculpture, the divine conceptions of the poet; the pomp of feſtivals and ſacrifices; the ſucceſsful arts of divination; the popular traditions of oracles and prodigies; and the ancient practice of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years.

One of the orations of Julian is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the honour of Cybele, the mother of the gods, who required from her effeminate prieſts the bloody ſacrifice, ſo raſhly performed by the madneſs of the Phrygian boy. The pious emperor condeſcends to relate, without a bluſh, and without a ſmile, the voyage of the goddeſs from the ſhores of Pergamus to the mouth of the Tyber; and the ſtupendous miracle, which convinced the ſenate and people of Rome that the lump of clay, which their ambaſſadors had tranſported over the ſeas, was endowed with life, and ſentiment, and divine power <note n="13" place="bottom">The Idaean mother landed in Italy about the end of the ſecond Punic war.

The extravagance of the Grecian mythology proclaimed with a clear and audible voice, that the pious enquirer, inſtead of being ſcandalized or ſatisfied with the literal ſenſe, ſhould diligently explore the occult wiſdom, which had been diſguiſed, by the prudence of antiquity, under the maſk of folly and of fable <note n="15" place="bottom">See the principles of allegory, in Julian (Orat. vii. p. 216. 222.).

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0034700104:78"/>

He ſwears with the moſt fervent and enthuſiaſtic devotion; and trembles, leſt he ſhould betray too much of theſe holy myſteries, which the profane might deride with an impious Sardonic laugh.</note>. It was indeed a treaſure, which derived its value only from opinion; and every artiſt, who flattered himſelf that he had extracted the precious ore from the ſurrounding droſs, claimed an equal right of ſtamping the name and figure the moſt agreeable to his peculiar fancy. The fable of Atys and Cybele had been already explained by Porphyry; but his labours ſerved only to animate the pious induſtry of Julian, who invented and publiſhed his own allegory of that ancient and myſtic tale. This freedom of interpretation, which might gratify the pride of the Platoniſts, expoſed the vanity of their art. Without a tedious detail, the modern reader could not form a juſt idea of the ſtrange alluſions, the forced etymologies, the ſolemn trifling, and the impenetrable obſcurity of theſe ſages, who profeſſed to reveal the ſyſtem of the univerſe. As the traditions of pagan mythology were variouſly related, the ſacred interpreters were at liberty to ſelect the moſt convenient cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; and as they tranſlated an arbitrary cypher, they could extract from <hi>any</hi> fable <hi>any</hi> ſenſe which was adapted to their favourite ſyſtem of religion and philoſophy. The laſcivious form of a naked Venus was tortured into the diſcovery
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0034700104:79"/>
of ſome moral precept, or ſome phyſical truth; and the caſtration of Atys explained the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſun between the tropics, or the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the human ſoul from vice and error <note n="18" place="bottom">See the fifth oration of Julian. But all the allegories which ever iſſued from the Platonic ſchool, are not worth the ſhort poem of Catullus on the ſame extraordinary ſubject.

But as the faith, which is not founded on revelation, muſt remain deſtitute of any firm aſſurance, the diſciple of Plato imprudently relapſed into the habits of vulgar ſuperſtition; and the popular and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic notion of the Deity ſeems to have been confounded in the practice, the writings, and even in the mind of Julian <note n="19" place="bottom">The true religion of Julian may be deduced from the Caeſars, p. 308. with Spanheim's notes and illuſtrations, from the fragments in Cyril, l. ii. p. 57, 58. and eſpecially from the theological oration in Solem Regem, p. 130—158. addreſſed, in the confidence of friendſhip, to the praefect Salluſt.</note>. The pious empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror acknowledged and adored the Eternal Cauſe of the univerſe, to whom he aſcribed all the perfections of an infinite nature, inviſible to the eyes, and inacceſſible to the underſtanding, of feeble mortals. The Supreme God had created, or rather, in the Platonic language, had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the gradual ſucceſſion of dependent ſpirits, of gods, of daemons, of heroes, and of men; and every being which derived its exiſtence imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the Firſt Cauſe, received the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0034700104:80"/>
gift of immortality. That ſo precious an advantage might not be laviſhed upon unworthy objects, the Creator had entruſted to the ſkill and power of the inferior gods, the office of forming the human body, and of arranging the beautiful harmony of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms. To the conduct of theſe divine miniſters he delegated the temporal government of this lower world; but their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect adminiſtration is not exempt from diſcord or error. The earth, and its inhabitants, are divided among them, and the characters of Mars or Minerva, of Mercury or Venus, may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly traced in the laws and manners of their peculiar votaries. As long as our immortal ſouls are confined in a mortal priſon, it is our intereſt, as well as our duty, to ſolicit the favour, and to deprecate the wrath, of the powers of heaven; whoſe pride is gratified by the devotion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and whoſe groſſer parts may be ſuppoſed to derive ſome nouriſhment from the fumes of ſacrifice <note n="20" place="bottom">Julian adopts this groſs conception, by aſcribing it to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Marcus Antoninus (Caeſares, p. 333.). The Stoics and Platoniſts heſitated between the analogy of bodies, and the purity of ſpirits; yet the graveſt philoſophers inclined to the whimſical fancy of Ariſtophanes and Lucian, that an unbelieving age might ſtarve the immortal gods. See Obſervations de Spanheim, p. 284, 444, &amp;c.</note>. The inferior gods might ſometimes condeſcend to animate the ſtatues, and to inhabit the temples, which were dedicated to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. They might occaſionally viſit the earth, but the heavens were the proper throne and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of their glory. The invariable order of the

ſun, moon, and ſtars, was haſtily admitted by Julian, as a proof of their <hi>eternal</hi> duration; and their eternity was a ſufficient evidence that they were the workmanſhip, not of an inferior deity, but of the Omnipotent King. In the ſyſtem of the Platoniſts, the viſible, was a type of the inviſible, world. The celeſtial bodies, as they were informed by a divine ſpirit, might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the objects the moſt worthy of religious worſhip. The SUN, whoſe genial influence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades and ſuſtains the univerſe, juſtly claimed the adoration of mankind, as the bright repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the LOGOS, the lively, the rational, the beneficent image of the intellectual Father <note n="21" place="bottom">

The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance which adorned the ſevere manners of the ſoldier and the philoſopher, was connected with ſome ſtrict and frivolous rules of religious abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; and it was in honour of Pan or Mercury, of Hecate or Iſis, that Julian, on particular days, denied himſelf the uſe of ſome particular food, which might have been offenſive to his tutelar deities. By theſe voluntary faſts, he prepared his ſenſes and his underſtanding for the frequent and familiar viſits with which he was honoured by the celeſtial powers. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the modeſt ſilence of Julian himſelf, we may learn from his faithful friend, the orator Libanius, that he lived in a perpetual intercourſe with the gods and goddeſſes; that they deſcended upon earth, to enjoy the converſation of their favourite hero; that they gently interrupted his ſlumbers, by touching his hand or his hair; that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0034700104:85"/>
they warned him of every impending danger, and conducted him, by their infallible wiſdom, in every action of his life; and that he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſuch an intimate knowledge of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gueſts, as readily to diſtinguiſh the voice of Jupiter from that of Minerva, and the form of Apollo from the figure of Hercules <note n="26" place="bottom">Julian's modeſty confined him to obſcure and occaſional hints; but Libanius expatiates with pleaſure on the faſts and viſions of the religious hero (Legat. ad Julian. p. 157. and Orat. Parental. c. lxxxiii. p. 309, 310).</note>. Theſe ſleeping or waking viſions, the ordinary effects of abſtinence and fanaticiſm, would almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade the emperor to the level of an Egyptian monk. But the uſeleſs lives of Antony or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomius were conſumed in theſe vain occupations. Julian could break from the dream of ſuperſtition to arm himſelf for battle; and after vanquiſhing in the field the enemies of Rome, he calmly retired into his tent, to dictate the wiſe and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary laws of an empire, or to indulge his genius in the elegant purſuits of literature and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0034700104:86"/>
the object of the hopes, the prayers, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the pagans, in every province of the empire. From the zeal and virtues of their royal proſelyte, they fondly expected the cure of every evil, and the reſtoration of every bleſſing; and inſtead of diſapproving of the ardour of their pious wiſhes, Julian ingenuouſly confeſſed, that he was ambitious to attain a ſituation, in which he might be uſeful to his country, and to his religion. But this religion was viewed with an hoſtile eye by the ſucceſſor of Conſtantine, whoſe capricious paſſions alternately ſaved and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the life of Julian. The arts of magic and divination were ſtrictly prohibited under a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic government, which condeſcended to fear them; and if the pagans were reluctantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in the exerciſe of their ſuperſtition, the rank of Julian would have excepted him from the general toleration.

               <q>As the ſtatues of the gods, ſays that orator, which have been defiled with filth, are again placed in a magnificent temple; ſo the beauty of truth was ſeated in the mind of Julian, after it had been purified from the errors and follies of his education.

But as every act of diſſimulation muſt be painful to an ingenuous ſpirit, the profeſſion of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity encreaſed the averſion of Julian for a religion, which oppreſſed the freedom of his mind, and compelled him to hold a conduct repugnant to the nobleſt attributes of human nature, ſincerity and courage.</p>

The inclination of Julian might prefer the gods of Homer, and of the Scipios, to the new faith, which his uncle had eſtabliſhed in the <note place="margin">He writes againſt Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> Roman empire; and in which he himſelf had been ſanctified by the ſacrament of baptiſm. But as a philoſopher, it was incumbent on him to juſtify his diſſent from Chriſtianity, which was ſupported by the number of its converts, by the chain of prophecy, the ſplendour of miracles, and the weight of evidence. The elaborate work <note n="30" place="bottom">Fabricius (Biblioth.

the celebrated name of Porphyry was effaced by the ſuperior merit or reputation of Julian.

But in the aſſiduous proſecution of theſe theological ſtudies, the emperor of the Romans imbibed the illiberal prejudices and paſſions of a polemic divine.

            <p>The Chriſtians, who beheld with horror and <note place="margin">Univerſal toleration.</note> indignation the apoſtacy of Julian, had much more to fear from his power than from his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

But the hopes, as well as the fears, of the religious factions were apparently diſappointed, by the

prudent humanity of a prince <note n="33" place="bottom">Libanius (Orat. Parent. c. lviii. p. 283, 284.) has eloquently explained the tolerating principles and conduct of his Imperial friend. In a very remarkable epiſtle to the people of Boſtra, Julian himſelf (epiſt. lii.) profeſſes his moderation, and betrays his zeal; which is acknowledged by Ammianus, and expoſed by Gregory (Orat. iii. p. 72.).</note>, who was careful of his own fame, of the public peace, and of the rights of mankind. Inſtructed by hiſtory and reflection, Julian was perſuaded, that if the diſeaſes of the body may ſometimes be cured by ſalutary violence, neither ſteel nor fire can era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the erroneous opinions of the mind. The reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of the altar; but the heart ſtill abhors and diſclaims the ſacrilegious act of the hand. Religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy is hardened and exaſperated by oppreſſion; and, as ſoon as the perſecution ſubſides, thoſe who have yielded, are reſtored as penitents, and thoſe who have reſiſted, are honoured as ſaints and martyrs. If Julian adopted the unſucceſsful cruelty of Diocletian and his colleagues, he was ſenſible that he ſhould ſtain his memory with the name of tyrant, and add new glories to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic church, which had derived ſtrength and encreaſe from the ſeverity of the pagan magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. Actuated by theſe motives, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of diſturbing the repoſe of an unſettled reign, Julian ſurpriſed the world by an edict, which was not unworthy of a ſtateſman, or a philoſopher. He extended to all the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the Roman world, the benefits of a free and equal toleration; and the only hardſhip
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0034700104:91"/>
which he inflicted on the Chriſtians, was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of the power of tormenting their fellow-ſubjects, whom they ſtigmatiſed with the odious titles of idolaters and heretics. The Pagans received a gracious permiſſion, or rather an expreſs order, to open ALL their temples <note n="34" place="bottom">In Greece, the temples of Minerva were opened by his expreſs command, before the death of Conſtantius (Liban. Orat. Parent. c. 55. p. 280.); and Julian declares himſelf a pagan in his public manifeſto to the Athenians. This unqueſtionable evidence may correct the haſty aſſertion of Ammianus, who ſeems to ſuppoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople to be the place where he diſcovered his attachment to the gods.</note>; and they were at once delivered from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive laws, and arbitrary vexations, which they had ſuſtained under the reign of Conſtantine, and of his ſons. At the ſame time, the biſhops and clergy, who had been baniſhed by the Arian monarch, were recalled from exile, and reſtored to their reſpective churches; the Donatiſts, the Novatians, the Macedonians, the Eunomians, and thoſe who, with a more proſperous fortune, adhered to the doctrine of the council of Nice. Julian, who underſtood and derided their theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical diſputes, invited to the palace the leaders of the hoſtile ſects, that he might enjoy the agreeable ſpectacle of their furious encounters. The clamour of controverſy ſometimes provoked the emperor to exclaim, <q>Hear me! the Franks have heard me, and the Alemanni;</q> but he ſoon diſcovered that he was now engaged with more obſtinate and implacable enemies; and though he exerted the powers of oratory to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to live in concord, or at leaſt in peace, he was perfectly ſatisfied, before he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed

As the buſineſs of the ſtate prevented the emperor from joining every day in the public devotion of his ſubjects, he dedicated a domeſtic chapel to his tutelar deity the Sun; his gardens were filled with ſtatues and altars of the gods; and each apartment of the palace diſplayed the appearance of a magnificent temple. Every morning he ſaluted the parent of light with a ſacrifice; the blood of another victim was ſhed at the moment when the Sun ſunk below the horizon; and the Moon, the Stars, and the Genii of the night received their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0034700104:93"/>
reſpective and ſeaſonable honours from the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable devotion of Julian. On ſolemn feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, he regularly viſited the temple of the god or goddeſs to whom the day was peculiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, and endeavoured to excite the religion of the magiſtrates and people by the example of his own zeal. Inſtead of maintaining the lofty ſtate of a monarch, diſtinguiſhed by the ſplendor of his purple, and encompaſſed by the golden ſhields of his guards, Julian ſolicited, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful eagerneſs, the meaneſt offices which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the worſhip of the gods. Amidſt the ſacred but licentious crowd of prieſts, of inferior miniſters, and of female dancers, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the ſervice of the temple, it was the buſineſs of the emperor to bring the wood, to blow the fire, to handle the knife, to ſlaughter the victim, and thruſting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring animal, to draw forth the heart or liver, and to read, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate ſkill of an haruſpex, the imaginary ſigns of future events. The wiſeſt of the pagans cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured this extravagant ſuperſtition, which affected to deſpiſe the reſtraints of prudence and decency. Under the reign of a prince, who practiſed the rigid maxims of oeconomy, the expence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip conſumed a very large portion of the revenue; a conſtant ſupply of the ſcarceſt and moſt beautiful birds was tranſported from diſtant climates, to bleed on the altars of the gods; an hundred oxen were frequently ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed by Julian on one and the ſame day; and it ſoon became a popular jeſt, that if he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

with conqueſt from the Perſian war, the breed of horned cattle muſt infallibly be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. Yet this expence may appear inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, when it is compared with the ſplendid preſents which were offered, either by the hand, or by order, of the emperor, to all the celebrated places of devotion in the Roman world; and with the ſums allotted to repair and decorate the ancient temples, which had ſuffered the ſilent decay of time, or the recent injuries of Chriſtian rapine. Encouraged by the example, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, the liberality, of their pious ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, the cities and families reſumed the practice of their neglected ceremonies. <q>Every part of the world, exclaims Libanius, with devout tranſport, diſplayed the triumph of religion; and the grateful proſpect of flaming altars, bleeding victims, the ſmoke of incenſe, and a ſolemn train of prieſts and prophets, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear and without danger.

            <p>About the ſame time that Julian was informed of the tumult of Alexandria, he received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from Edeſſa, that the proud and wealthy faction of the Arians had inſulted the weakneſs of the Valentinians; and committed ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as ought not to be ſuffered with impunity in a well-regulated ſtate.

Julian admits the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that a wiſe and vigorous government ſhould chaſtiſe the inſolence of the people: yet, in conſideration of their founder Alexander, and of Serapis their tutelar deity, he grants a free and gracious pardon to the guilty city, for which he again feels the affection of a brother <note n="128" place="bottom">Julian.

His paſtoral labours were not confined to the narrow limits of Egypt.

threaten a public and laſting diviſion of the Greek and Latin churches.

Julian, who deſpiſed the Chriſtians,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0034700104:140"/>
honoured Athanaſius with his ſincere and peculiar hatred. For his ſake alone, he introduced an arbitrary diſtinction, repugnant, at leaſt to the ſpirit, of his former declarations. He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that the Galilaeans, whom he had recalled from exile, were not reſtored, by that general indulgence, to the poſſeſſion of their reſpective churches: and he expreſſed his aſtoniſhment, that a criminal, who had been repeatedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the judgment of the emperors, ſhould dare to inſult the majeſty of the laws, and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently uſurp the archiepiſcopal throne of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, without expecting the orders of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. As a puniſhment for the imaginary offence, he again baniſhed Athanaſius from the city; and he was pleaſed to ſuppoſe, that this act of juſtice would be highly agreeable to his pious ſubjects. The preſſing ſolicitations of the people ſoon convinced him, that the majority of the Alexandrians were Chriſtians; and that the greateſt part of the Chriſtians were firmly attached to the cauſe of their oppreſſed primate. But the knowledge of their ſentiments, inſtead of perſuading him to recall his decree, provoked him to extend to all Egypt the term of the exile of Athanaſius. The zeal of the multitude ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Julian ſtill more inexorable: he was alarmed by the danger of leaving at the head of a tumultuous city, a daring and popular leader; and the language of his reſentment diſcovers the opinion which he entertained of the courage and abilities of Athanaſius. The execution of the ſentence was ſtill delayed, by the caution or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0034700104:141"/>

As ſoon as the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0034700104:143"/>
enmity of Julian deprived the clergy of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges which had been conferred by the favour of Conſtantine, they complained of the moſt cruel oppreſſion; and the free toleration of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters and heretics was a ſubject of grief and ſcandal to the orthodox party <note n="136" place="bottom">Hear the furious and abſurd complaint of Optatus (de Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat.

At Peſſinus, the altar of Cybele was overturned almoſt in the preſence of the emperor; and in the city of Caeſarea in Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia, the temple of Fortune, the ſole place of worſhip which had been left to the Pagans, was deſtroyed by the rage of a popular tumult. On theſe occaſions, a prince, who felt for the honour of the gods, was not diſpoſed to interrupt the courſe of juſtice; and his mind was ſtill more deeply exaſperated, when he found, that the fanatics, who had deſerved and ſuffered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of incendiaries, were rewarded with the honours of martyrdom <note n="137" place="bottom">Greg.

and ſuſpicion. In the ordinary adminiſtration of the laws, the Chriſtians, who formed ſo large a part of the people, muſt frequently be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: but their indulgent brethren, without examining the merits of the cauſe, preſumed their innocence, allowed their claims, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the ſeverity of their judge to the partial malice of religious perſecution <note n="138" place="bottom">Julian determined a law-ſuit againſt the new Chriſtian city at Maiuma, the port of Gaza; and his ſentence, though it might be imputed to bigotry, was never reverſed by his ſucceſſors.

Theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hardſhips, intolerable as they might appear, were repreſented as a ſlight prelude of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending calamities.

Yet <hi>contemporary</hi> malice could not impute to Julian the troops of martyrs, more eſpecially in the Weſt, which Baronius ſo greedily ſwallows, and Tillemont ſo faintly rejects (Mem.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0034700104:145"/>
could wound the reputation of the Apoſtate, was credulouſly embraced by the fears and hatred of his adverſaries; and their indiſcreet clamours provoked the temper of a ſovereign, whom it was their duty to reſpect, and their intereſt to flatter. They ſtill proteſted, that prayers and tears were their only weapons againſt the impious tyrant, whoſe head they devoted to the juſtice of offended Heaven. But they inſinuated, with ſullen reſolution, that their ſubmiſſion was no longer the effect of weakneſs; and that, in the imperfect ſtate of human virtue, the patience, which is founded on principle, may be exhauſted by perſecution. It is impoſſible to determine how far the zeal of Julian would have prevailed over his good ſenſe and humanity: but, if we ſeriouſly reflect on the ſtrength and ſpirit of the church, we ſhall be convinced, that, before the emperor could have extinguiſhed the religion of Chriſt, he muſt have involved his country in the horrors of a civil war <note n="141" place="bottom">The reſignation of Gregory is truly edifying (Orat. iv. p. 123, 124.).

During the freedom and equality of the days of the Saturnalia, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus prepared a feaſt for the deities of Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, who had adopted him as a worthy aſſociate, and for the Roman princes, who had reigned over his martial people, and the vanquiſhed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth. The immortals were placed in juſt order on their thrones of ſtate, and the table of the Caeſars was ſpread below the Moon,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0034700104:147"/>
in the upper region of the air. The tyrants, who would have diſgraced the ſociety of gods and men, were thrown headlong, by the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable Nemeſis, into the Tartarean abyſs. The reſt of the Caeſars ſucceſſively advanced to their ſeats; and, as they paſſed, the vices, the defects, the blemiſhes of their reſpective characters, were maliciouſly noticed by old Silenus, a laughing moraliſt, who diſguiſed the wiſdom of a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher under the maſk of a Bacchanal <note n="3" place="bottom">This mixed character of Silenus is finely painted in the ſixth eclogue of Virgil.</note>. As ſoon as the feaſt was ended, the voice of Mercury proclaimed the will of Jupiter, that a celeſtial crown ſhould be the reward of ſuperior merit.

Each of the candidates was allowed to diſplay the merit of his own exploits; but, in the judgment of the gods, the modeſt ſilence of Marcus pleaded more powerfully than the elaborate orations of his haughty rivals.

more deciſive and conſpicuous <note n="5" place="bottom">Julian was ſecretly inclined to prefer a Greek to a Roman.

The value of this agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (the Caeſars of Julian) is enhanced by the rank of the author.

As ſoon as the Perſian monarch was informed that the throne of Conſtantius was filled by a prince of a very different character, he condeſcended to make ſome artful, or perhaps ſincere, overtures, towards a negociation of peace. But the pride of Sapor was aſtoniſhed by the firmneſs of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian; who ſternly declared, that he would never conſent to hold a peaceful conference among the flames and ruins of the cities of Meſopotamia; and who added, with a ſmile of contempt, that it was needleſs to treat by ambaſſadors, as he himſelf had determined to viſit ſpeedily the court of Perſia. The impatience of the emperor urged the diligence of the military preparations. The generals were named; a formidable army was deſtined for this important ſervice; and Julian, marching from Conſtantinople through the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Aſia Minor, arrived at Antioch about eight months after the death of his predeceſſor.

But the fair and reaſonable proportion was ſoon violated by the rapacious

In this unequal conteſt, in which the produce of the land is claimed by one party, as his excluſive property; is uſed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as a lucrative object of trade; and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by a third, for the daily and neceſſary ſupport of life; all the profits of the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate agents are accumulated on the head of the defenceleſs conſumers. The hardſhips of their ſituation were exaggerated and encreaſed by their own impatience and anxiety; and the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſcarcity gradually produced the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of a famine. When the luxurious citizens of Antioch complained of the high price of poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and fiſh, Julian publicly declared, that a frugal city ought to be ſatisfied with a regular ſupply of wine, oil, and bread; but he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that it was the duty of a ſovereign to provide for the ſubſiſtence of his people. With this ſalutary view, the emperor ventured on a very dangerous and doubtful ſtep, of fixing, by legal authority, the value of corn. He enacted, that, in a time of ſcarcity, it ſhould be ſold at a price which had ſeldom been known in the moſt plentiful years; and that his own example might ſtrengthen his laws, he ſent into the market four hundred and twenty-two thouſand <hi>modii,</hi> or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which were drawn, by his order, from the granaries of Hierapolis, of Chalcis, and even of Egypt. The conſequences might have been foreſeen, and were ſoon felt. The Imperial wheat was purchaſed by the rich merchants; the proprietors of land, or of corn, withheld from

the city the accuſtomed ſupply; and the ſmall quantities that appeared in the market, were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſold at an advanced and illegal price. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian ſtill continued to applaud his own policy, treated the complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful murmur, and convinced Antioch, that he had inherited the obſtinacy, though not the cruelty, of his brother Gallus <note n="16" place="bottom">Nunquam a propoſito declinabat, Galli ſimilis fratris, licet incruentus.

A milder ſentence might have deprived the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of the Eaſt of its honours and privileges; and the courtiers, perhaps the ſubjects, of Julian, would have applauded an act of juſtice, which aſſerted the dignity of the ſupreme magiſtrate of the republic <note n="19" place="bottom">Libanius (ad Antiochen. c. vii. p. 213.) reminds Antioch of the recent chaſtiſement of Caeſarea: and even Julian (in Miſopogon, p. 355.) inſinuates how ſeverely Tarentum had expiated the inſult to the Roman ambaſſadors.</note>.

If the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of Julian had been ſimilar to thoſe of his predeceſſor, he might have waſted the active and important ſeaſon of the year in the circus of Samoſata, or in the churches of Edeſſa.

the immenſe preparations of the Perſian war. The ſecret of the expedition had hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in his own breaſt; but as Carrhae is the point of ſeparation of the two great roads, he could no longer conceal, whether it was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to attack the dominions of Sapor on the ſide of the Tigris, or on that of the Euphrates. The emperor detached an army of thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, under the command of his kinſman Procopius, and of Sebaſtian, who had been duke of Egypt. They were ordered to direct their march towards Niſibis, and to ſecure the frontier from the deſultory incurſions of the enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they attempted the paſſage of the Tigris.

            <p>The military diſpoſitions of Julian were ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">Military prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> contrived to deceive the ſpies, and to divert the attention, of Sapor. The legions appeared to direct their march towards Niſibis and the Tigris. On a ſudden they wheeled to the right; traverſed the level and naked plain of Carrhae; and reached, on the third day, the banks of the Euphrates, where the ſtrong town of Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, or Callinicum, had been founded by the Macedonian kings. From thence the emperor purſued his march, above ninety miles, along the winding ſtream of the Euphrates, till, at length, about one month after his departure from Antioch, he diſcovered the towers of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſium, the extreme limit of the Roman domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. The army of Julian, the moſt numerous that any of the Caeſars had ever led againſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, conſiſted of ſixty-five thouſand effective and well-diſciplined ſoldiers. The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry, of Romans and Barbarians, had been ſelected from the different provinces; and a juſt pre-eminence of loyalty and valour was claimed by the hardy Gauls, who guarded the throne and perſon of their beloved prince. A formidable body of Scythian auxiliaries had been tranſported from another climate, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt from another world, to invade a diſtant country, of whoſe name and ſituation they were
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0034700104:167"/>

The love of rapine and war allured to the Imperial ſtandard ſeveral tribes of Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens, or roving Arabs, whoſe ſervice Julian had commanded, while he ſternly refuſed the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the accuſtomed ſubſidies. The broad channel of the Euphrates <note n="41" place="bottom">Latiſſimum flumen Euphraten artabat. Ammian. xxiii. 3.

If the breadth of the Euphrates at Bir and Zeugma is no more than 130 yards (Voyages de Niebuhr, tom. ii. p. 335.), the enormous differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt chiefly ariſe from the depth of the channel.</note> was crowded by a fleet of eleven hundred ſhips, deſtined to attend the motions, and to ſatisfy the wants, of the Roman army. The military ſtrength of the fleet was compoſed of fifty armed gallies; and theſe were accompanied by an equal number of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottomed boats, which might occaſionally be connected into the form of temporary bridges. The reſt of the ſhips, partly conſtructed of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and partly covered with raw hides, were laden with an almoſt inexhauſtible ſupply of arms and engines, of utenſils and proviſions. The vigilant humanity of Julian had embarked a very large magazine of vinegar and biſcuit for the uſe of the ſoldiers, but he prohibited the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of wine; and rigorouſly ſtopped a long ſtring of ſuperfluous camels that attempted to follow the rear of the army.

He animated the impatient and attentive legions by the example of the inflexible courage and glorious triumphs of their anceſtors. He excited their reſentment by a lively picture of the inſolence of the Perſians; and he exhorted them to imitate his firm reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, either to extirpate that perfidious nation, or to devote his life in the cauſe of the republic. The eloquence of Julian was enforced by a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native of one hundred and thirty pieces of ſilver to every ſoldier; and the bridge of the Chaboras was inſtantly cut away, to convince the troops that they muſt place their hopes of ſafety in the ſucceſs of their arms. Yet the prudence of the emperor induced him to ſecure a remote frontier, perpetually expoſed to the inroads of the hoſtile Arabs. A detachment of four thouſand men was left at Circeſium, which completed, to the number of ten thouſand, the regular garriſon of that important fortreſs <note n="43" place="bottom">The enterprize and armament of Julian are deſcribed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (Epiſt. xxvii.), Ammianus Marcellinus (xxiii. 3, 4, 5.), Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius (Orat.

He was a Perſian prince, of the royal race of the Saſſanides, who, in the troubles of the minority of Sapor, had eſcaped from priſon to the hoſpitable court of the great Conſtantine. Hormiſdas, at firſt, excited the compaſſion, and, at length, acquired the eſteem, of his new maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; his valour and fidelity raiſed him to the military honours of the Roman ſervice; and, though a Chriſtian, he might indulge the ſecret ſatisfaction of convincing his ungrateful country, that an oppreſſed ſubject may prove the moſt dangerous enemy. Such was the diſpoſition of the three principal columns. The front and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0034700104:170"/>
flanks of the army were covered by Lucillianus with a flying detachment of fifteen hundred light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed ſoldiers, whoſe active vigilance obſerved the moſt diſtant ſigns, and conveyed the earlieſt notice, of any hoſtile approach. Dagalaiphus, and Secundinus duke of Oſrhoene, conducted the troops of the rear-guard; the baggage, ſecurely, proceeded in the intervals of the columns; and the ranks, from a motive either of uſe or oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, were formed in ſuch open order, that the whole line of march extended almoſt ten miles. The ordinary poſt of Julian was at the head of the centre column; but as he preferred the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a general to the ſtate of a monarch, he rapidly moved, with a ſmall eſcort of light ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, to the front, the rear, the flanks, wherever his preſence could animate or protect the march of the Roman army. The country which they traverſed from the Chaboras, to the cultivated lands of Aſſyria, may be conſidered as a part of the deſert of Arabia, a dry and barren waſte, which could never be improved by the moſt powerful arts of human induſtry. Julian marched over the ſame ground which had been trod above ſeven hundred years before by the footſteps of the younger Cyrus, and which is deſcribed by one of the companions of his expedition, the ſage and heroic Xenophon <note n="47" place="bottom">See the firſt book of the Anabaſis, p. 45, 46.

ſtop the march of a Roman emperor; till they were diverted from ſuch fatal preſumption by the mild exhortations of prince Hormiſdas, and the approaching terrors of the fleet and army. They implored, and experienced, the clemency of Julian; who tranſplanted the people to an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous ſettlement, near Chalcis in Syria, and admitted Puſaeus, the governor, to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable rank in his ſervice and friendſhip. But the impregnable fortreſs of Thilutha could ſcorn the menace of a ſiege; and the emperor was obliged to content himſelf with an inſulting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that when he had ſubdued the interior provinces of Perſia, Thilutha would no longer refuſe to grace the triumph of the conqueror. The inhabitants of the open towns, unable to reſiſt, and unwilling to yield, fled with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation; and their houſes, filled with ſpoil and proviſions, were occupied by the ſoldiers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, who maſſacred, without remorſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out puniſhment, ſome defenceleſs women.

The whole country

might have claimed the peculiar name of Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia; as the two rivers, which are never more diſtant than fifty, approach, between Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad and Babylon, within twenty-five, miles of each other. A multitude of artificial canals, dug without much labour in a ſoft and yielding ſoil, connected the rivers, and interſected the plain, of Aſſyria. The uſes of theſe artificial canals were various and important. They ſerved to diſcharge the ſuperfluous waters from one river into the other, at the ſeaſon of their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inundations. Subdividing themſelves into ſmaller and ſmaller branches, they refreſhed the dry lands, and ſupplied the deficiency of rain. They facilitated the intercourſe of peace and commerce; and, as the dams could be ſpeedily broke down, they armed the deſpair of the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians with the means of oppoſing a ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge to the progreſs of an invading army. To the ſoil and climate of Aſſyria, nature had denied ſome of her choiceſt gifts, the vine, the olive, and the fig-tree; but the food which ſupports the life of man, and particularly wheat and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, were produced with inexhauſtible fertility; and the huſbandman, who committed his ſeed to the earth, was frequently rewarded with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of two, or even of three, hundred.

Babylon had been converted into a royal park; but near the ruins of the ancient capital, new cities had ſucceſſively ariſen, and the populouſneſs of the country was diſplayed in the multitude of towns and villages, which were built of bricks, dried in the ſun, and ſtrongly cemented with bitumen; the natural and peculiar production of the Babylonian ſoil. While the ſucceſſors of Cyrus reigned over Aſia, the province of Aſſyria alone maintained, during a third part of the year, the luxurious plenty of the table and houſehold of the Great King. Four conſiderable villages were aſſigned for the ſubſiſtence of his Indian dogs; eight hundred ſtallions, and ſixteen thouſand mares, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept, at the expence of the country, for the royal ſtables: and as the daily tribute, which was paid to the ſatrap, amounted to one Engliſh buſhel of ſilver, we may compute the annual revenue of Aſſyria at more than twelve hundred thouſand pounds ſterling <note n="56" place="bottom">Aſſyria yielded to the Perſian ſatrap, an <hi>Artaba</hi> of ſilver each day. The well-known proportion of weights and meaſures (ſee Biſhop Hooper's elaborate Inquiry), the ſpecific gravity of water and ſilver, and the value of that metal, will afford, after a ſhort proceſs, the annual revenue which I have ſtated. Yet the Great King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no more than 1000 Euboic, or Tyrian, talents (252,000l.) from Aſſyria.

The fields of Aſſyria were devoted by Julian to the calamities of war; and the philoſopher retaliated on a guiltleſs people the acts of rapine <note place="margin">Invaſion of Aſſyria, A. D. 363. May.</note> and cruelty, which had been committed by their haughty maſter in the Roman provinces. The trembling Aſſyrians ſummoned the rivers to their aſſiſtance; and completed, with their own hands, the ruin of their country. The roads were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered impracticable; a flood of waters was poured into the camp; and, during ſeveral days, the troops of Julian were obliged to contend with the moſt diſcouraging hardſhips. But every obſtacle was ſurmounted by the perſeverance of the legionaries, who were inured to toil as well as to danger, and who felt themſelves animated by the ſpirit of their leader. The damage was gradually repaired; the waters were reſtored to their proper channels; whole groves of palm-trees were cut down, and placed along the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken parts of the road; and the army paſſed over the broad and deeper canals, on bridges of float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rafts, which were ſupported by the help of bladders. Two cities of Aſſyria preſumed to reſiſt the arms of a Roman emperor: and they both paid the ſevere penalty of their raſhneſs. At the diſtance of fifty miles from the royal reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <note place="margin">Siege of Periſabor,</note> of Cteſiphon, Periſabor, or Anbar, held
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0034700104:177"/>
the ſecond rank in the province: a city, large, populous, and well fortified, ſurrounded with a double wall, almoſt encompaſſed by a branch of the Euphrates, and defended by the valour of a numerous garriſon. The exhortations of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſdas were repulſed with contempt; and the ears of the Perſian prince were wounded by a juſt reproach, that, unmindful of his royal birth, he conducted an army of ſtrangers againſt his king and country. The Aſſyrians maintained their loyalty by a ſkilful, as well as vigorous, defence; till the lucky ſtroke of a battering-ram, having opened a large breach, by ſhattering one of the angles of the wall, they haſtily retired into the fortifications of the interior citadel. The ſoldiers of Julian ruſhed impetuouſly into the town, and, after the full gratification of every military appetite, Periſabor was reduced to aſhes; and the engines which aſſaulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the ſmoking houſes. The conteſt was continued by an inceſſant and mutual diſcharge of miſſile weapons; and the ſuperiority which the Romans might derive from the mechanical powers of their baliſtae and cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultae was counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground on the ſide of the beſieged. But as ſoon as an <hi>Helepolis</hi> had been conſtructed, which could engage on equal terms with the loftieſt ramparts, the tremendous aſpect of a moving turret, that would leave no hope of reſiſtance or of mercy, terrified the defenders of the citadel into an humble ſubmiſſion; and the place was ſurrendered only two days after Julian firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0034700104:178"/>
under the walls of Periſabor. Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred perſons, of both ſexes, the feeble remnant of a flouriſhing people, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to retire: the plentiful magazines of corn, of arms, and of ſplendid furniture, were partly diſtributed among the troops, and partly reſerved for the public ſervice: the uſeleſs ſtores were deſtroyed by fire, or thrown into the ſtream of the Euphrates; and the fate of Amida was revenged by the total ruin of Periſabor.</p>
            <p>The city, or rather fortreſs, of Maogamalcha, <note place="margin">of Maoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcha.</note> which was defended by ſixteen large towers, a deep ditch, and two ſtrong and ſolid walls of brick and bitumen, appears to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed at the diſtance of eleven miles, as the ſafeguard of the capital of Perſia. The emperor, apprehenſive of leaving ſuch an important fortreſs in his rear, immediately formed the ſiege of Maogamalcha; and the Roman army was diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, for that purpoſe, into three diviſions. Victor, at the head of the cavalry, and of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of heavy-armed foot, was ordered to clear the country, as far as the banks of the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris, and the ſuburbs of Cteſiphon. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the attack was aſſumed by Julian himſelf, who ſeemed to place his whole dependence in the military engines which he erected againſt the walls; while he ſecretly contrived a more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious method of introducing his troops into the heart of the city. Under the direction of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitta and Dagalaiphus, the trenches were opened at a conſiderable diſtance, and gradually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed as far as the edge of the ditch. The
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0034700104:179"/>
ditch was ſpeedily filled with earth; and, by the inceſſant labour of the troops, a mine was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried under the foundations of the walls, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, at ſufficient intervals, by props of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Three choſen cohorts, advancing in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle file, ſilently explored the dark and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paſſage; till their intrepid leader whiſpered back the intelligence, that he was ready to iſſue from his confinement into the ſtreets of the hoſtile city. Julian checked their ardour, that he might enſure their ſucceſs; and immediately diverted the attention of the garriſon, by the tumult and clamour of a general aſſault. The Perſians, who, from their walls, contemptuouſly beheld the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of an impotent attack, celebrated, with ſongs of triumph, the glory of Sapor; and ventured to aſſure the emperor, that he might aſcend the ſtarry manſion of Ormuſd, before he could hope to take the impregnable city of Mao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamalcha. The city was already taken. Hiſtory has recorded the name of a private ſoldier, the firſt who aſcended from the mine into a deſerted tower. The paſſage was widened by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who preſſed forwards with impatient valour. Fifteen hundred enemies were already in the midſt of the city. The aſtoniſhed gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon abandoned the walls, and their only hope of ſafety; the gates were inſtantly burſt open; and the revenge of the ſoldier, unleſs it were ſuſpended by luſt or avarice, was ſatiated by an undiſtinguiſhing maſſacre. The governor, who had yielded on a promiſe of mercy, was burnt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0034700104:180"/>
alive, a few days afterwards, on a charge of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uttered ſome diſreſpectful words againſt the honour of Prince Hormiſdas. The fortifications were razed to the ground; and not a veſtige was left, that the city of Maogamalcha had ever exiſted. The neighbourhood of the capital of Perſia was adorned with three ſtately palaces, laboriouſly enriched with every production that could gratify the luxury and pride of an Eaſtern monarch. The pleaſant ſituation of the gardens along the banks of the Tigris, was improved, according to the Perſian taſte, by the ſymmetry of flowers, fountains, and ſhady walks: and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious parks were incloſed for the reception of the bears, lions, and wild boars, which were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at a conſiderable expence for the pleaſure of the royal chace. The park-walls were broke down, the ſavage game was abandoned to the darts of the ſoldiers, and the palaces of Sapor were reduced to aſhes, by the command of the Roman emperor. Julian, on this occaſion, ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ignorant, or careleſs, of the laws of civility, which the prudence and refinement of poliſhed ages have eſtabliſhed between hoſtile princes. Yet theſe wanton ravages need not excite in our breaſts any vehement emotions of pity or reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A ſimple, naked ſtatue, finiſhed by the hand of a Grecian artiſt, is of more genuine value than all theſe rude and coſtly monuments of Barbaric labour: and, if we are more deeply affected by the ruin of a palace, than by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of a cottage, our humanity muſt have

When the Romans marched through the flat and flooded country, their ſovereign, on foot, at the head of his legions, ſhared their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, and animated their diligence. In every uſeful labour, the hand of Julian was prompt and ſtrenuous; and the Imperial purple was wet and dirty, as the coarſe garment of the meaneſt ſoldier. The two ſieges allowed him ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable opportunities of ſignaliſing his perſonal valour, which, in the improved ſtate of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary art, can ſeldom be exerted by a prudent general. The emperor ſtood before the citadel of Periſabor, inſenſible of his extreme danger, and encouraged his troops to burſt open the gates of iron, till he was almoſt overwhelmed under a cloud of miſſile weapons, and huge ſtones, that were directed againſt his perſon. As he examined the exterior fortifications of Maogamalcha, two Perſians, devoting themſelves for their country, ſuddenly ruſhed upon him with drawn ſcimitars: the emperor dexterouſly received their blows on his uplifted ſhield; and,

The eſteem of a prince who poſſeſſes the virtues which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, is the nobleſt recompence of a deſerving ſubject; and the authority which Julian derived from his perſonal merit, enabled him to revive and enforce the rigour of ancient diſcipline.

But the reduction, or even the ſiege, of the capital of Perſia, was ſtill at a diſtance: nor can the military conduct of the emperor be clearly apprehended, without a knowledge of the country which was the theatre of his bold and ſkilful operations <note n="65" place="bottom">M. d'Anville (Mem. de l'Academie des Inſcriptions, tom. xxviii. p. 246—259.) has aſcertained the true poſition and diſtance of Babylon, Seleucia, Cteſiphon, Bagdad, &amp;c.

He is a gentleman and a ſcholar, but intolerably vain and prolix.</note>. Twenty miles to the ſouth of Bagdad, and on the eaſtern bank of the Tigris, the curioſity of travellers has obſerved ſome ruins of the palaces of Cteſiphon, which, in the time of Julian, was a great and populous city. The name and glory of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Seleucia were for ever extinguiſhed; and the only remaining quarter of that Greek colony had reſumed, with the Aſſyrian language and manners, the primitive appellation of Coche.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0034700104:186"/>
Coche was ſituate on the weſtern ſide of the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris; but it was naturally conſidered as a ſuburb of Cteſiphon, with which we may ſuppoſe it to have been connected by a permanent bridge of boats. The united parts contributed to form the common epithet of Al Modain, THE CITIES, which the Orientals have beſtowed on the winter reſidence of the Saſſanides; and the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Perſian capital was ſtrongly fortified by the waters of the river, by lofty walls, and by impracticable moraſſes. Near the ruins of Seleucia, the camp of Julian was fixed; and ſecured, by a ditch and rampart, againſt the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the numerous and enterpriſing garriſon of Coche. In this fruitful and pleaſant country, the Romans were plentifully ſupplied with water and forage: and ſeveral forts, which might have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed the motions of the army, ſubmitted, after ſome reſiſtance, to the efforts of their valour. The fleet paſſed from the Euphrates into an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial derivation of that river, which pours a copious and navigable ſtream into the Tigris, at a ſmall diſtance <hi>below</hi> the great city. If they had followed this royal canal, which bore the name of Nahar-Malcha <note n="66" place="bottom">The royal canal <hi>(Nahar-Malcha)</hi> might be ſucceſſively reſtored, altered, divided, &amp;c. (Cellarius, Geograph. Antiq. tom. ii. p. 453.): and theſe changes may ſerve to explain the ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions of antiquity. In the time of Julian, it muſt have fallen into the Euphrates <hi>below</hi> Cteſiphon.</note>, the intermediate ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Coche would have ſeparated the fleet and army of Julian; and the raſh attempt of ſteering againſt the current of the Tigris, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0034700104:187"/>
forcing their way through the midſt of a hoſtile capital, muſt have been attended with the total deſtruction of the Roman navy. The prudence of the emperor foreſaw the danger, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the remedy. As he had minutely ſtudied the operations of Trajan in the ſame country, he ſoon recollected, that his warlike predeceſſor had dug a new and navigable canal, which, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coche on the right-hand, conveyed the waters of the Nahar-Malcha into the river Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris, at ſome diſtance <hi>above</hi> the cities. From the information of the peaſants, Julian aſcertained the veſtiges of this ancient work, which were almoſt obliterated by deſign or accident. By the indefatigable labour of the ſoldiers, a broad and deep channel was ſpeedily prepared for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Euphrates. A ſtrong dike was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to interrupt the ordinary current of the Nahar-Malcha: a flood of waters ruſhed impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly into their new bed; and the Roman fleet, ſteering their triumphant courſe into the Tigris, derided the vain and ineffectual barriers which the Perſians of Cteſiphon had erected to oppoſe their paſſage.</p>
            <p>As it became neceſſary to tranſport the Roman <note place="margin">Paſſage of the Tigris, and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Romans.</note> army over the Tigris, another labour preſented itſelf, of leſs toil, but of more danger, than the preceding expedition. The ſtream was broad and rapid; the aſcent ſteep and difficult; and the intrenchments which had been formed on the ridge of the oppoſite bank, were lined with a numerous army of heavy cuiraſſiers, dextrous
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0034700104:188"/>
archers, and huge elephants; who (according to the extravagant hyperbole of Libanius) could trample, with the ſame eaſe, a field of corn, or a legion of Romans <note n="67" place="bottom">

In the preſence of ſuch an enemy, the conſtruction of a bridge was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable; and the intrepid prince, who inſtantly ſeized the only poſſible expedient, concealed his deſign, till the moment of execution, from the knowledge of the Barbarians, of his own troops, and even of his generals themſelves. Under the ſpecious pretence of examining the ſtate of the magazines, fourſcore veſſels were gradually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden; and a ſelect detachment, apparently deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined for ſome ſecret expedition, was ordered to ſtand to their arms on the firſt ſignal. Julian diſguiſed the ſilent anxiety of his own mind with ſmiles of confidence and joy; and amuſed the hoſtile nations with the ſpectacle of military games, which he inſultingly celebrated under the walls of Coche. The day was conſecrated to pleaſure; but, as ſoon as the hour of ſupper was paſt, the emperor ſummoned the generals to his tent; and acquainted them, that he had fixed that night for the paſſage of the Tigris. They ſtood in ſilent and reſpectful aſtoniſhment; but, when the venerable Salluſt aſſumed the privilege of his age and experience, the reſt of the chiefs ſupported with freedom the weight of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

Julian contented himſelf with obſerving, that conqueſt and ſafety depended on the attempt; that, inſtead of diminiſhing, the number of their enemies would be increaſed, by ſucceſſive reinforcements; and that a longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay would neither contract the breadth of the ſtream, nor level the height of the bank. The ſignal was inſtantly given, and obeyed: the moſt impatient of the legionaries leaped into five veſſels that lay neareſt to the bank; and, as they plied their oars with intrepid diligence, they were loſt, after a few moments, in the darkneſs of the night. A flame aroſe on the oppoſite ſide; and Julian, who too clearly underſtood that his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt veſſels, in attempting to land, had been fired by the enemy, dexterouſly converted their extreme danger into a preſage of victory. <q>Our fellow-ſoldiers, he eagerly exclaimed, are already maſters of the bank; ſee—they make the appointed ſignal: let us haſten to emulate and aſſiſt their courage.</q> The united and rapid motion of a great fleet broke the violence of the current, and they reached the eaſtern ſhore of the Tigris with ſufficient ſpeed to extinguiſh the flames, and reſcue their adventurous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. The difficulties of a ſleep and lofty aſcent were increaſed by the weight of armour, and the darkneſs of the night. A ſhower of ſtones, darts, and fire, was inceſſantly diſcharged on the heads of the aſſailants; who, after an
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0034700104:190"/>
arduous ſtruggle, climbed the bank, and ſtood victorious upon the rampart.

The whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement laſted above twelve hours; till the gradual retreat of the Perſians was changed into a diſorderly flight, of which the ſhameful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample was given by the principal leaders, and the Surenas himſelf.

The ſpoil was ſuch as might be expected from the riches and luxury of an Oriental camp; large quantities of ſilver and gold, ſplendid arms and trappings, and beds and tables of maſſy ſilver. The victorious emperor diſtributed, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of valour, ſome honourable gifts, civic, and mural, and naval, crowns; which he, and perhaps he alone, eſteemed more precious than the wealth of Aſia.

His expectations were diſappointed by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of the Armenian king, who permitted, and moſt probably directed, the deſertion of his auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary troops from the camp of the Romans <note n="74" place="bottom">Moſes of Chorene (Hiſt.

At the very time when he declined the ſiege of Cteſiphon, he rejected, with obſtinacy and diſdain, the moſt flattering offers of a nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of peace. Sapor, who had been ſo long accuſtomed to the tardy oſtentation of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, was ſurpriſed by the intrepid diligence of his ſucceſſor. As far as the confines of India and Scythia, the ſatraps of the diſtant provinces were ordered to aſſemble their troops, and to march, without delay, to the aſſiſtance of their monarch. But their preparations were dilatory, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſlow; and before Sapor could lead an army into the field, he received the melancholy intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the devaſtation of Aſſyria, the ruin of his palaces, and the ſlaughter of his braveſt troops, who defended the paſſage of the Tigris.

The Saſſanian prince, whether he liſtened to the voice of pride or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, whether he conſulted the ſentiments of his birth, or the duties of his ſituation, was equally inclined to promote a ſalutary meaſure, which would terminate the calamities of Perſia, and ſecure the triumph of Rome.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0034700104:195"/>
replied, that if he deſired to exerciſe his valour, he might ſeek the army of the Great King. He felt the inſult, and he accepted the advice. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of confining his ſervile march to the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris, he reſolved to imitate the adventurous ſpirit of Alexander, and boldly to advance into the inland provinces, till he forced his rival to contend with him, perhaps in the plains of Arbela, for the empire of Aſia. The magnanimity of Julian was applauded and betrayed, by the arts of a noble Perſian, who, in the cauſe of his country, had generouſly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to act a part full of danger, of falſehood, and of ſhame <note n="77" place="bottom">The arts of this new Zopyrus (Greg.

The extenſive region that lies between the river Tigris and the mountains of Media, was filled with villages and towns; and the fertile ſoil, for the moſt part, was in a very improved ſtate of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0034700104:199"/>
cultivation. Julian might expect, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, who poſſeſſed the two forcible inſtruments of perſuaſion, ſteel and gold, would eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a plentiful ſubſiſtence from the fears or ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of the natives. But, on the approach of the Romans, this rich and ſmiling proſpect was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly blaſted. Wherever they moved, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants deſerted the open villages, and took ſhelter in the fortified towns; the cattle was driven away; the graſs and ripe corn were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with fire; and, as ſoon as the flames had ſubſided which interrupted the march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of a ſmoking and naked deſert. This deſperate but effectual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of defence, can only be executed by the enthuſiaſm of a people who prefer their inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence to their property; or by the rigour of an arbitrary government, which conſults the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſafety without ſubmitting to their inclinations the liberty of choice. On the preſent occaſion, the zeal and obedience of the Perſians ſeconded the commands of Sapor; and the emperor was ſoon reduced to the ſcanty ſtock of proviſions, which continually waſted in his hands.

The Romans wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſeveral days in the country to the eaſtward of Bagdad: the Perſian deſerter, who had art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully led them into the ſnare, eſcaped from their reſentment; and his followers, as ſoon as they were put to the torture, confeſſed the ſecret of the conſpiracy.

Theſe detachments were, however, ſupported by a much greater force; and the heads of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns were no ſooner pointed towards the Tigris, than a cloud of duſt aroſe on the plain. The Romans, who now aſpired only to the permiſſion of a ſafe and ſpeedy retreat, endeavoured to perſuade themſelves, that this formidable appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was occaſioned by a troop of wild aſſes, or perhaps by the approach of ſome friendly Arabs. They halted, pitched their tents, fortified their camp, paſſed the whole night in continual alarms; and diſcovered, at the dawn of day, that they were ſurrounded by an army of Perſians. This army, which might be conſidered only as the van of the Barbarians, was ſoon followed by the main body of cuiraſſiers, archers, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, commanded by Meranes, a general of rank and reputation. He was accompanied by two of the king's ſons, and many of the principal ſatraps; and fame and expectation exaggerated the ſtrength of the remaining powers, which ſlowly advanced under the conduct of Sapor himſelf. As the Romans continued their march, their long array, which was forced to bend, or divide, according to the varieties of the ground, afforded frequent and favourable opportunities to their vigilant enemies. The Perſians repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly charged with fury; they were repeatedly repulſed with firmneſs; and the action at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronga, which almoſt deſerved the name of a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, was marked by a conſiderable loſs of ſatraps and elephants, perhaps of equal value in the eyes
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0034700104:202"/>
of their monarch. Theſe ſplendid advantages were not obtained without an adequate ſlaughter on the ſide of the Romans: ſeveral officers of diſtinction were either killed or wounded; and the emperor himſelf, who, on all occaſions of danger, inſpired and guided the valour of his troops, was obliged to expoſe his perſon, and exert his abilities. The weight of offenſive and defenſive arms, which ſtill conſtituted the ſtrength and ſafety of the Romans, diſabled them from making any long or effectual purſuit; and as the horſemen of the Eaſt were trained to dart their javelins, and ſhoot their arrows, at full ſpeed, and in every poſſible direction <note n="88" place="bottom">Chardin, the moſt judicious of modern travellers, deſcribes (tom. iii. p. 57, 58, &amp;c. edit. in 4. to.) the education and dexterity of the Perſian horſemen.

The monarch ſtarted from his couch, and ſtepping forth, to refreſh his wearied ſpirits with the coolneſs of the midnight air, he beheld a

evolution of the light infantry, who aimed their weapons, with dexterity and effect, againſt the backs of the horſemen, and the legs of the elephants. The Barbarians fled; and Julian, who was foremoſt in every danger, animated the purſuit with his voice and geſtures. His trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling guards, ſcattered and oppreſſed by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly throng of friends and enemies, reminded their fearleſs ſovereign that he was without ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and conjured him to decline the fall of the impending ruin.

His guards flew to his relief; and the wounded em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was gently raiſed from the ground, and conveyed out of the tumult of the battle into an adjacent tent. The report of the melancholy event paſſed from rank to rank; but the grief of the Romans inſpired them with invincible valour, and the deſire of revenge.

He employed the awful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the firm temper of a hero and a ſage; the philoſophers who had accompanied him in this fatal expedition, compared the tent of Julian with the priſon of Socrates; and the ſpectators, whom duty, or friendſhip, or curioſity, had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled round his couch, liſtened with reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful grief to the funeral oration of their dying emperor <note n="95" place="bottom">The character and ſituation of Julian might countenance the ſuſpicion, that he had previouſly compoſed the elaborate oration, which Ammianus heard, and has tranſcribed.

I have learned from philoſophy, how much the ſoul is more excellent than the body; and that the ſeparation of the nobler ſubſtance, ſhould be the ſubject of joy, rather than of affliction. I have learned from religion, that an early death has often been the reward of piety <note n="96" place="bottom">Herodotus (l. i. c. 31.) has diſplayed that doctrine in an agreeable tale.

I am pleaſed to reflect on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of my private life; and I can affirm with confidence, that the ſupreme authority, that emanation of the Divine Power, has been preſerved in my hands pure and immaculate.

I now offer my tribute of gratitude to the Eternal Being, who has not ſuffered me to periſh by the cruelty of a tyrant, by the ſecret dagger of conſpiracy, or by the ſlow tortures of lingering diſeaſe. He has given me, in the midſt of an honourable career, a ſplendid and glorious departure from this world; and I hold it equally abſurd, equally baſe, to ſolicit, or to decline, the ſtroke of fate.—Thus much I have attempted to ſay; but my ſtrength fails me, and I feel the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death.—I ſhall cautiouſly refrain from any word that may tend to influence your ſuffrages in the election of an emperor.

The ſpectators were ſilent; and Julian entered into a metaphyſical argument with the philoſophers Priſcus and Maximus, on the nature of the ſoul. The efforts which he made, of mind, as well as body, moſt probably haſtened his death. His wound began to bleed with freſh violence; his reſpiration was embarraſſed by the ſwelling of the veins: he called for a draught of cold water, and, as ſoon as he had drank it, expired without pain, about the hour of midnight.

But the royal race of Conſtantius Chlorus was reduced to his own perſon; and if he entertained any ſerious thoughts of inveſting with the purple the moſt worthy among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, he was diverted from his reſolution by the difficulty of the choice, the jealouſy of power, the fear of ingratitude, and the natural preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health, of youth, and of proſperity. His unexpected death left the empire without a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and without an heir, in a ſtate of perplexity and danger, which, in the ſpace of fourſcore years, had never been experienced, ſince the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Diocletian. In a government, which had almoſt forgotten the diſtinction of pure and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blood, the ſuperiority of birth was of little moment; the claims of official rank were acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental and precarious; and the candidates, who might aſpire to aſcend the vacant throne, could be ſupported only by the conſciouſneſs of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal merit, or by the hopes of popular favour. But the ſituation of a famiſhed army, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0034700104:211"/>
on all ſides by an hoſt of Barbarians, ſhortened the moments of grief and deliberation. In this ſcene of terror and diſtreſs, the body of the deceaſed prince, according to his own direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was decently embalmed; and, at the dawn of day, the generals convened a military ſenate, at which the commanders of the legions, and the officers, both of cavalry and infantry, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to aſſiſt. Three or four hours of the night had not paſſed away without ſome ſecret cabals; and when the election of an emperor was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the ſpirit of faction began to agitate the aſſembly. Victor and Arinthaeus collected the remains of the court of Conſtantius; the friends of Julian attached themſelves to the Gallic chiefs, Dagalaiphus and Nevitta; and the moſt fatal conſequences might be apprehended from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of two factions, ſo oppoſite in their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and intereſt, in their maxims of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perhaps in their religious principles. The ſuperior virtues of Salluſt could alone recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile their diviſions, and unite their ſuffrages; and the venerable praefect would immediately have been declared the ſucceſſor of Julian, if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with ſincere and modeſt firmneſs, had not alleged his age and infirmities, ſo unequal to the weight of the diadem. The generals, who were ſurpriſed and perplexed by his refuſal, ſhewed ſome diſpoſition to adopt the ſalutary advice of an inferior officer <note n="100" place="bottom">Honoratior aliquis miles; perhaps Ammianus himſelf.

for any of the ambitious qualifications which excite the admiration and envy of mankind, the comely perſon of Jovian, his cheerful tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and familiar wit, had gained the affection of his fellow-ſoldiers; and the generals of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties acquieſced in a popular election, which had not been conducted by the arts of their enemies. The pride of this unexpected elevation was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated by the juſt apprehenſion, that the ſame day might terminate the life and reign of the new emperor. The preſſing voice of neceſſity was obeyed without delay; and the firſt orders iſſued by Jovian, a few hours after his predeceſſor had expired, were to proſecute a march, which could alone extricate the Romans from their actual diſtreſs <note n="103" place="bottom">Ammianus (xxx. 10.) has drawn from the life an impartial portrait of Jovian: to which the younger Victor has added ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſtrokes.

With the aſſiſtance of his wiſeſt officers, Jovian endeavoured to check their raſhneſs; by repreſenting, that if they poſſeſſed ſufficient ſkill and vigour to ſtem the torrent of a deep and rapid ſtream, they would only deliver themſelves naked and defenceleſs to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, who had occupied the oppoſite banks. Yielding at length to their clamorous importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, he conſented, with reluctance, that five hundred Gauls and Germans, accuſtomed from their infancy to the waters of the Rhine and Danube, ſhould attempt the bold adventure, which might ſerve either as an encouragement, or as a warning, for the reſt of the army. In the ſilence of the night, they ſwam the Tigris, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed an unguarded poſt of the enemy, and diſplayed at the dawn of day the ſignal of their reſolution and fortune.

The hopes of ſafety ſubdued the firmneſs of the Romans; the emperor was compelled, by the advice of his council, and the cries of the ſoldiers, to embrace the offer of peace; and the praefect Salluſt was immediately ſent, with the general Arinthaeus, to underſtand the pleaſure of the Great King.

Many of theſe daring adventurers were ſwallowed by the waves; many others, who were carried along by the violence of the ſtream, fell an eaſy prey to the avarice, or cruelty, of the wild Arabs: and the loſs which the army ſuſtained in the paſſage of the Tigris, was not inferior to the carnage of a day of battle.

Jovian alleged, with ſome confuſion, the ſanctity of oaths; and, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance with which he accepted the preſent of a crown of gold, convinced the citizens of their hopeleſs condition, the advocate Sylvanus was provoked to exclaim, <q>O Emperor! may you thus be crowned by all the cities of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions!</q> Jovian, who, in a few weeks had aſſumed the habits of a prince <note n="124" place="bottom">At Niſibis he performed a <hi>royal</hi> act.

The highways were crowded with a trembling mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: the diſtinctions of rank, and ſex, and age, were loſt in the general calamity. Every one ſtrove to bear away ſome fragment from the wreck of his fortunes; and as they could not command the immediate ſervice of an adequate number of horſes or waggons, they were obliged to leave behind them the greateſt part of their valuable effects. The ſavage inſenſibility of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian appears to have aggravated the hardſhips of theſe unhappy fugitives.

            <p>THE death of Julian had left the public affairs of the empire in a very doubtful and dangerous ſituation. The Roman army was <note place="margin">State of the church, A. D. 363.</note> ſaved by an inglorious, perhaps a neceſſary, treaty <note n="1" place="bottom">The medals of Jovian adorn him with victories, laurel crowns, and proſtrate captives. Ducange, Famil. Byzantin. p. 52. Flattery is a fooliſh ſuicide: ſhe deſtroys herſelf with her own hands.</note>; and the firſt moments of peace were conſecrated by the pious Jovian to reſtore the domeſtic tranquillity of the church and ſtate. The indiſcretion of his predeceſſor, inſtead of reconciling, had artfully fomented the religious war: and the balance which he affected to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve between the hoſtile factions, ſerved only to perpetuate the conteſt, by the viciſſitudes of hope and fear, by the rival claims of ancient poſſeſſion and actual favour. The Chriſtians had forgotten the ſpirit of the Goſpel; and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans had imbibed the ſpirit of the church. In private families, the ſentiments of nature were
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0034700104:234"/>
extinguiſhed by the blind fury of zeal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: the majeſty of the laws was violated or abuſed; the cities of the Eaſt were ſtained with blood; and the moſt implacable enemies of the Romans were in the boſom of their country. Jovian was educated in the profeſſion of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity; and as he marched from Niſibis to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, the banner of the Croſs, the LABARUM of Conſtantine, which was again diſplayed at the head of the legions, announced to the people the faith of their new emperor. As ſoon as he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the throne, he tranſmitted a circular epiſtle to all the governors of provinces: in which he confeſſed the divine truth, and ſecured the legal eſtabliſhment, of the Chriſtian religion. The inſidious edicts of Julian were aboliſhed; the eccleſiaſtical immunities were reſtored and enlarged; and Jovian condeſcended to lament, that the diſtreſs of the times obliged him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the meaſure of charitable diſtributions <note n="2" place="bottom">Jovian reſtored to the church <gap reason="foreign">

The new law which condemned the rape or marriage of nuns (Cod. Theod. l. ix. tit. xxv. leg. 2.), is exaggerated by Sozomen; who ſuppoſes, that an amorous glance, the adultery of the heart, was puniſhed with death by the evangelic legiſlator.</note>. The Chriſtians were unanimous in the loud and ſincere applauſe which they beſtowed on the pious ſucceſſor of Julian. But they were ſtill ignorant, what creed, or what ſynod, he would chuſe for the ſtandard of orthodoxy; and the peace of the church immediately revived thoſe

eager diſputes which had been ſuſpended during the ſeaſon of perſecution. The epiſcopal leaders of the contending ſects, convinced, from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, how much their fate would depend on the earlieſt impreſſions that were made on the mind of an untutored ſoldier, haſtened to the court of Edeſſa, or Antioch. The highways of the Eaſt were crowded with Homoouſian, and Arian, and Semi-Arian, and Eunomian biſhops, who ſtruggled to outſtrip each other in the holy race: the apartments of the palace reſounded with their clamours; and the ears of the prince were aſſaulted, and perhaps aſtoniſhed, by the ſingular mixture of metaphyſical argument and paſſionate invective <note n="3" place="bottom">Compare Socrates, l. iii. c. 25. and Philoſtorgius, l. viii. c. 6. with Godefroy's Diſſertations, p. 330.</note>. The moderation of Jovian, who recommended concord and charity, and referred the diſputants to the ſentence of a future council, was interpreted as a ſymptom of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: but his attachment to the Nicene creed was at length diſcovered and declared, by the reverence which he expreſſed for the <note n="4" place="bottom">The word <hi>caeleſtial</hi> faintly expreſſes the impious and extravagant ſlattery of the emperor to the archbiſhop, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0034700104:236"/>
throne; and he wiſely accepted, or anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated, the invitation of Jovian. The venerable figure of Athanaſius, his calm courage, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating eloquence, ſuſtained the reputation which he had already acquired in the courts of four ſucceſſive princes <note n="5" place="bottom">Athanaſius, at the court of Antioch, is agreeably repreſented by La Bleterie (Hiſt. de Jovien, tom. i. p. 121—148.): he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the ſingular and original conferences of the emperor, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of Egypt, and the Arian deputies. The Abbé is not ſatisfied with the coarſe pleaſantry of Jovian; but his partiality for Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius aſſumes, in <hi>his</hi> eyes, the character of juſtice.</note>. As ſoon as he had gained the confidence, and ſecured the faith, of the Chriſtian emperor, he returned in triumph to his dioceſe, and continued, with mature coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and undiminiſhed vigour, to direct, ten years longer <note n="6" place="bottom">The true aera of his death is perplexed with ſome difficulties (Tillemont, Mem.

Before his departure from Antioch, he aſſured Jovian that his orthodox devotion would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a long and peaceful reign. Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius had reaſon to hope, that he ſhould be allowed either the merit of a ſucceſsful prediction, or the excuſe of a grateful, though ineffectual, prayer <note n="7" place="bottom">See the obſervations of Valeſius and Jortin (Remarks on Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Hiſtory, vol. iv. p. 38.) on the original letter of Athanaſius; which is preſerved by Theodoret (l. iv. c. 3.).

Under his reign, Chriſtianity obtained an eaſy and laſting victory; and as ſoon as the ſmile of royal patronage was withdrawn, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of paganiſm, which had been fondly raiſed and cheriſhed by the arts of Julian, ſunk irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably in the duſt. In many cities, the temples were ſhut or deſerted; the philoſophers, who had abuſed their tranſient favour, thought it prudent to ſhave their beards, and diſguiſe their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and the Chriſtians rejoiced, that they were now in a condition to forgive, or to revenge, the injuries which they had ſuffered under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding reign <note n="9" place="bottom">Socrates, l. iii. c. 24.

The conſternation of the Pagan world was diſpelled by a wiſe and gracious edict of toleration; in which Jovian explicitly declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that although he ſhould ſeverely puniſh the ſacrilegious rites of magic, his ſubjects might exerciſe, with freedom and ſafety, the ceremonies of the ancient worſhip. The memory of this law has been preſerved by the orator Themiſtius, who was deputed by the ſenate of Conſtantinople
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0034700104:238"/>
to expreſs their loyal devotion for the new empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Themiſtius expatiates on the clemency of the Divine Nature, the facility of human error, the rights of conſcience, and the independence of the mind; and, with ſome eloquence, inculcates the principles of philoſophical toleration; whoſe aid Superſtition herſelf, in the hour of her diſtreſs, is not aſhamed to implore. He juſtly obſerves, that, in the recent changes, both religions had been alternately diſgraced by the ſeeming acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of worthleſs proſelytes, of thoſe votaries of the reigning purple, who could paſs, without a reaſon, and without a bluſh, from the church to the temple, and from the altars of Jupiter to the ſacred table of the Chriſtians <note n="10" place="bottom">Themiſtius, Orat. v. p. 63—71. edit.

He was impatient to poſſeſs the palace of Conſtantinople; and to prevent the ambition of ſome competitor, who might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy the vacant allegiance of Europe. But he ſoon received the grateful intelligence, that his authority was acknowledged from the Thracian Boſphorus to the Atlantic ocean. By the firſt letters which he diſpatched from the camp of Meſopotamia, he had delegated the military command of Gaul and Illyricum to Malarich, a brave and faithful officer of the nation of the Franks; and to his father-in-law, count Lucil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, who had formerly diſtinguiſhed his courage and conduct in the defence of Niſibis.

We cannot expect a perfect agreement, and we ſhall not diſcuſs minute differences.</note>. But the want of a regular enquiry into the death
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0034700104:241"/>
of a prince, whoſe reign and perſon were ſoon forgotten, appears to have been the only circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which countenanced the malicious whiſpers of poiſon and domeſtic guilt <note n="17" place="bottom">Ammianus, unmindful of his uſual candour and good ſenſe, compares the death of the harmleſs Jovian to that of the ſecond Africanus, who had excited the fears and reſentment of the popular faction.</note>.

Her diſappointment and grief were embittered by the anxiety of maternal tenderneſs. Six weeks before the death of Jovian, his infant ſon had been placed in the curule chair, adorned with the title of <hi>Nobiliſſimus,</hi> and the vain enſigns of the conſulſhip. Unconſcious of his fortune, the royal youth, who, from his grandfather, aſſumed the name of Varronian, was reminded only by the jealouſy of the government, that he was the ſon of an emperor. Sixteen years afterwards he was ſtill alive, but he had already been deprived of an eye; and his afflicted mother expected, every hour, that the innocent victim would be torn from her arms, to appeaſe, with his blood, the ſuſpicions of the reigning prince <note n="18" place="bottom">Chryſoſtom, tom. i. p. 336. 344. edit.

Zoſimus, l. iii. p. 198. Philoſtorgius, l. viii. c. 8. and Godefroy, Diſſertat. p. 334. Philoſtorgius, who appears to have obtained ſome curious and authentic intelligence, aſcribes the choice of Valentinian to the praefect Salluſt; the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general Arintheus, Dagalaiphus, count of the domeſtics, and the Patrician Datianus, whoſe preſſing recommendations from Ancyra had a weighty influence in the election.</note>. In a ſolemn aſſembly of the civil and military powers of the empire, the diadem was again unanimouſly offered to the praefect Salluſt. He enjoyed the glory of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond refuſal; and when the virtues of the father were alleged in favour of his ſon, the praefect, with the firmneſs of a diſintereſted patriot, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the electors, that the feeble age of the one, and the unexperienced youth of the other, were equally incapable of the laborious duties of government. Several candidates were propoſed: and, after weighing the objections of character or ſituation, they were ſucceſſively rejected: but, as ſoon as the name of Valentinian was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the merit of that officer united the ſuffrages
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0034700104:243"/>
of the whole aſſembly, and obtained the ſincere approbation of Salluſt himſelf. Valentinian <note n="21" place="bottom">Ammianus (xxx. 7. 9.), and the younger Victor, have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the portraits of Valentinian; which naturally precedes and illuſtrates the hiſtory of his reign.</note> was the ſon of count Gratian, a native of Cibalis, <note place="margin">Election and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</note> in Pannonia, who, from an obſcure condition, had raiſed himſelf, by matchleſs ſtrength and dexterity, to the military commands of Africa and Britain; from which he retired, with an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fortune and ſuſpicious integrity. The rank and ſervices of Gratian contributed, however, to ſmooth the firſt ſteps of the promotion of his ſon; and afforded him an early opportunity of diſplaying thoſe ſolid and uſeful qualifications, which raiſed his character above the ordinary level of his fellow-ſoldiers. The perſon of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian was tall, graceful, and majeſtic. His manly countenance, deeply marked with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſenſe and ſpirit, inſpired his friends with awe, and his enemies with fear: and, to ſecond the efforts of his undaunted courage, the ſon of Gratian had inherited the advantages of a ſtrong and healthy conſtitution. By the habits of chaſtity and temperance, which reſtrain the appetites, and invigorate the faculties, Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian preſerved his own, and the public, eſteem. The avocations of a military life had diverted his youth from the elegant purſuits of literature; he was ignorant of the Greek language, and the arts of rhetoric; but as the mind of the orator was never diſconcerted by timid perplexity, he was able, as often as the occaſion prompted him,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0034700104:244"/>
to deliver his decided ſentiments with bold and ready elocution. The laws of martial diſcipline were the only laws that he had ſtudied; and he was ſoon diſtinguiſhed by the laborious diligence, and inflexible ſeverity, with which he diſcharged and inforced the duties of the camp. In the time of Julian he provoked the danger of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, by the contempt which he publicly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed for the reigning religion <note n="22" place="bottom">At Antioch, where he was obliged to attend the emperor to the temple, he ſtruck a prieſt, who had preſumed to purify him with luſtral water (Sozomen, l. vi. c. 6. Theodoret, l. iii. c. 15.). Such public defiance might become Valentinian; but it could leave no room for the unworthy delation of the philoſopher Maximus, which ſuppoſes ſome more private offence (Zoſimus, l. iv. p. 200, 201.).</note>; and it ſhould ſeem, from his ſubſequent conduct, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet and unſeaſonable freedom of Valentinian was the effect of military ſpirit, rather than of Chriſtian zeal. He was pardoned, however, and ſtill employed by a prince who eſteemed his merit <note n="23" place="bottom">Socrates, l. iv. A previous exile to Melitene, or Thebais (the firſt might be poſſible), is interpoſed by Sozomen (l. vi. c. 6.) and Philoſtorgius, l. vii. c. 7. with Godefroy's Diſſertations, p. 293.).</note>: and in the various events of the Perſian war, he improved the reputation which he had already acquired on the banks of the Rhine. The celerity and ſucceſs with which he executed an important commiſſion, recommended him to the favour of Jovian; and to the honourable command of the ſecond <hi>ſchool,</hi> or company, of Targetteers, of the domeſtic guards. In the march from Antioch, he had reached his quarters at Ancyra, when he was unexpectedly ſummoned, without guilt, and without intrigue, to aſſume,

The aged Salluſt, who had long obſerved the irregular fluctuations of popular aſſemblies, propoſed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of death, that none of thoſe perſons, whoſe rank in the ſervice might excite a party in their favour, ſhould appear in public, on the day of the inauguration. Yet ſuch was the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of ancient ſuperſtition, that a whole day was voluntarily added to this dangerous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, becauſe it happened to be the intercalation of the Biſſextile <note n="24" place="bottom">Ammianus, in a long, becauſe unſeaſonable, digreſſion (xxvi. 1. and Valeſius ad locum), raſhly ſuppoſes that he underſtands an aſtronomical queſtion, of which his readers are ignorant. It is treated with more judgment and propriety by Cenſorinus (de Die Natali, c. 20.), and Macrobius (Saturnal. l. i. cap. 12—16.). The apellation of <hi>Biſſextile,</hi> which marks the inauſpicious year (Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin. ad Januarium, Epiſt. 119.), is derived from the <hi>repetition</hi> of the <hi>ſixth</hi> day of the calends of March.</note>. At length, when the hour was ſuppoſed to be propitious, Valentinian ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf from a lofty tribunal: the judicious choice was applauded; and the new prince was ſolemnly inveſted with the diadem and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, amidſt the acclamations of the troops, who were diſpoſed in martial order round the tribunal. But when he ſtretched forth his hand to addreſs the armed multitude, a buſy whiſper was acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally ſtarted in the ranks, and inſenſibly ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a loud and imperious clamour, that he ſhould name, without delay, a colleague in the

In the caſtle or palace of Mediana, only three miles from Naiſſus, they executed the ſolemn and final diviſion of the Roman empire <note n="32" place="bottom">Ammianus, xxvi. 5.</note>. Valentinian beſtowed on his brother the rich praefecture of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> from the Lower Danube to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Perſia; whilſt he reſerved for his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate government the warlike praefectures of <hi>Illyricum, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> from the extremity of Greece to the Caledonian rampart; and from the rampart of Caledonia, to the foot of Mount Atlas.

of Cappadocia. Theſe uſeful and innocent occupations were interrupted by the appearance of an officer, with a band of ſoldiers, who, in the name of his new ſovereigns, Valentinian and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens, was diſpatched to conduct the unfortunate Procopius, either to a perpetual priſon, or an ignominious death. His preſence of mind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him a longer reſpite, and a more ſplendid fate. Without preſuming to diſpute the royal mandate, he requeſted the indulgence of a few moments, to embrace his weeping family; and, while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by a plentiful entertainment, he dexterouſly eſcaped to the ſea-coaſt of the Euxine, from whence he paſſed over to the country of Boſphorus. In that ſequeſtered region he remained many months, expoſed to the hardſhips of exile, of ſolitude, and of want; his melancholy temper brooding over his misfortunes, and his mind agitated by the juſt apprehenſion, that, if any accident ſhould diſcover his name, the faithleſs Barbarians would violate, without much ſcruple, the laws of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitality. In a moment of impatience and deſpair, Procopius embarked in a merchant veſſel, which made ſail for Conſtantinople; and boldly aſpired to the rank of a ſovereign, becauſe he was not allowed to enjoy the ſecurity of a ſubject. At firſt he lurked in the villages of Bithynia, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually changing his habitation, and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe <note n="36" place="bottom">One of his retreats was a country-houſe of Eunomius, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic. The maſter was abſent, innocent, ignorant: yet he narrowly eſcaped a ſentence of death, and was baniſhed into the remote parts of Mauritania (Philoſtorg. l. ix. c. 5. 8. and Godefroy's Diſſert. p. 369—378.).</note>. By degrees he ventured into the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0034700104:252"/>
truſted his life and fortune to the fidelity of two friends, a ſenator and an eunuch, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome hopes of ſucceſs, from the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence which he obtained of the actual ſtate of public affairs. The body of the people was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a ſpirit of diſcontent: they regretted the juſtice and the abilities of Salluſt, who had been imprudently diſmiſſed from the praefecture of the Eaſt. They deſpiſed the character of Valens, which was rude without vigour, and feeble without mildneſs. They dreaded the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his father-in-law, the Patrician Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius, a cruel and rapacious miniſter, who ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly exacted all the arrears of tribute, that might remain unpaid ſince the reign of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Aurelian. The circumſtances were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to the deſigns of an uſurper. The hoſtile meaſures of the Perſians required the preſence of Valens in Syria: from the Danube to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates the troops were in motion; and the capital was occaſionally filled with the ſoldiers who paſſed, or repaſſed, the Thracian Boſphorus. Two cohorts of Gauls were perſuaded to liſten to the ſecret propoſals of the conſpirators; which were recommended by the promiſe of a liberal donative; and, as they ſtill revered the memory of Julian, they eaſily conſented to ſupport the hereditary claim of his proſcribed kinſman. At the dawn of day they were drawn up near the baths of Anaſtaſia; and Procopius, clothed in a purple garment, more ſuitable to a player than to a monarch, appeared, as if he roſe from the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0034700104:253"/>
dead, in the midſt of Conſtantinople. The ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who were prepared for his reception, ſaluted their trembling prince with ſhouts of joy, and vows of fidelity. Their numbers were ſoon increaſed by a ſturdy band of peaſants, collected from the adjacent country; and Procopius, ſhielded by the arms of his adherents, was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively conducted to the tribunal, the ſenate, and the palace. During the firſt moments of his tumultuous reign, he was aſtoniſhed and terrified by the gloomy ſilence of the people; who were either ignorant of the cauſe, or apprehenſive of the event. But his military ſtrength was ſuperior to any actual reſiſtance: the malecontents flocked to the ſtandard of rebellion; the poor were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the hopes, and the rich were intimidated by the fear, of a general pillage; and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate credulity of the multitude was once more deceived by the promiſed advantages of a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. The magiſtrates were ſeized; the priſons and arſenals broke open; the gates, and the entrance of the harbour, were diligently occupied; and, in a few hours, Procopius became the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, though precarious, maſter of the Imperial city. The uſurper improved this unexpected ſucceſs with ſome degree of courage and dexterity. He artfully propagated the rumours and opinions the moſt favourable to his intereſt; while he deluded the populace by giving audience to the frequent, but imaginary, ambaſſadors of diſtant nations. The large bodies of troops ſtationed in the cities of Thrace, and the fortreſſes of the Lower Danube, were gradually involved in the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0034700104:254"/>
guilt of rebellion: and the Gothic princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to ſupply the ſovereign of Conſtantinople with the formidable ſtrength of ſeveral thouſand auxiliaries. His generals paſſed the Boſphorus, and ſubdued, without an effort, the unarmed, but wealthy, provinces of Bithynia and Aſia. After an honourable defence, the city and iſland of Cyzicus yielded to his power; the renowned legions of the Jovians and Herculians embraced the cauſe of the uſurper, whom they were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cruſh; and, as the veterans were continually augmented with new levies, he ſoon appeared at the head of an army, whoſe valour, as well as numbers, were not unequal to the greatneſs of the conteſt. The ſon of Hormiſdas <note n="37" place="bottom">Hormiſdae maturo juveni Hormiſdae regalis illius filio, poteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem Proconſulis detulit; et civilia, more veterum, et bella, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo.

The alliance of Fauſtina, the widow of the emperor Conſtantius, who entruſted her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and her daughter, to the hands of the uſurper, added dignity and reputation to his cauſe.

            <p>In the mean while, Valentinian was alarmed <note place="margin">His defeat and death, A. D. 366. May 28.</note> and perplexed, by the doubtful intelligence of the revolt of the Eaſt. The difficulties of a German war forced him to confine his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate care to the ſafety of his own dominions; and, as every channel of communication was ſtopt or corrupted, he liſtened, with a doubtful anxiety, to the rumours which were induſtriouſly ſpread; that the defeat and death of Valens had left Procopius ſole maſter of the eaſtern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. Valens was not dead: but, on the news of the rebellion, which he received at Caeſarea, he baſely deſpaired of his life and fortune; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to negociate with the uſurper, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his ſecret inclination to abdicate the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial purple. The timid monarch was ſaved from diſgrace and ruin by the firmneſs of his miniſters, and their abilities ſoon decided in his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0034700104:256"/>
favour the event of the civil war. In a ſeaſon of tranquillity, Salluſt had reſigned without a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur; but as ſoon as the public ſafety was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, he ambitiouſly ſolicited the pre-eminence of toil and danger; and the reſtoration of that virtuous miniſter to the praefecture of the Eaſt, was the firſt ſtep which indicated the repentance of Valens, and ſatisfied the minds of the people. The reign of Procopius was apparently ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by powerful armies, and obedient provinces. But many of the principal officers, military as well as civil, had been urged, either by motives of duty or intereſt, to withdraw themſelves from the guilty ſcene; or to watch the moment of betraying, and deſerting, the cauſe of the uſurper. Lupicinus advanced by haſty marches, to bring the legions of Syria to the aid of Valens. Arin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, who, in ſtrength, beauty, and valour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled all the heroes of the age, attacked with a ſmall troop a ſuperior body of the rebels. When he beheld the faces of the ſoldiers who had ſerved under his banner, he commanded them, with a loud voice, to ſeize and deliver up their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended leader; and ſuch was the aſcendant of his genius, that this extraordinary order was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obeyed <note n="40" place="bottom">Et dedignatus hominem ſuperare certamine deſpicabilem, auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritatis et celſi fiduciâ corporis, ipſis hoſtibus juſſit, ſuum vincire rectorem: atque ita turmarum anteſignanus umbratilis comprenſus ſuorum manibus. The ſtrength and beauty of Arintheus, the new Hercules, are celebrated by St. Baſil; who ſuppoſes that God had created him as an inimitable model of the human ſpecies. The painters and ſculptors could not expreſs his figure: the hiſtorians appeared fabulous when they related his exploits (Ammian. xxvi. and Valeſ. ad loc.).</note>. Arbetio, a reſpectable veteran

In the heat of action, calmly taking off his helmet, he ſhewed his grey hairs, and venerable countenance; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the ſoldiers of Procopius by the endearing names of children and companions, and exhorted them, no longer to ſupport the deſperate cauſe of a contemptible tyrant; but to follow their old commander, who had ſo often led them to honour and victory. In the two engagements of Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira <note n="41" place="bottom">The ſame field of battle is placed by Ammianus in Lycia, and by Zoſimus at Thyatira; which are at the diſtance of 150 miles from each other.

An anxious regard to his perſonal ſafety was the ruling principle of the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Valens.

The judgment of Valentinian was ſometimes deceived, and his confidence abuſed; but he would have ſilenced the informers with a contemptuous ſmile, had they preſumed to alarm his fortitude by the ſound of danger. They praiſed his inflexible love of juſtice; and, in the purſuit of juſtice, the emperor was eaſily tempted to conſider clemency as a weakneſs, and paſſion as a virtue. As long as he wreſtled with

But in the calmer moments of reflection, when the mind of Valens was not agitated by fear, or that of Valentinian by rage, the tyrant reſumed <note place="margin">Their laws and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> the ſentiments, or at leaſt the conduct, of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his country.

Both princes invariably retained, in the purple, the chaſte and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſimplicity which had adorned their private life; and, under their reign, the pleaſures of the court never coſt the people a bluſh or a ſigh.

It was his intention, that the arts of rhetoric and grammar ſhould be taught, in the Greek and Latin languages, in the metropolis of every province; and as the ſize and dignity of the ſchool was uſually proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the importance of the city, the academies of Rome and Conſtantinople claimed a juſt and ſingular pre-eminence. The fragments of the literary edicts of Valentinian imperfectly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſchool of Conſtantinople, which was gradually improved by ſubſequent regulations. That ſchool conſiſted of thirty-one profeſſors in different branches of learning.

The ſtudious youth were ſeverely prohibited from waſting their time in feaſts, or in the theatre; and the term of their education was limited to the age of twenty. The praefect of the city was empowered to chaſtiſe the idle and refractory, by ſtripes or expulſion; and he was directed to make an annual report to the maſter of the offices, that the knowledge and abilities of the ſcholars might be uſefully applied to the public ſervice.

The art of magic, as it was more cruelly puniſhed, was more ſtrictly proſcribed; but the emperor admitted a formal diſtinction to protect the ancient methods of divination, which were approved by the ſenate, and exerciſed by the Tuſcan haruſpices.

After he had taken this deciſive ſtep, it was extremely difficult for him to preſerve either the virtue, or the reputation, of impartiality. He never aſpired, like Conſtantius, to the fame of a profound theologian; but, as he had received with ſimplicity and reſpect the tenets of Eudoxus, Valens reſigned his conſcience to the direction of his eccleſiaſtical guides, and promoted, by the influence of his authority, the re-union of the <hi>Athanaſian heretics</hi> to the body of the catholic church. At firſt, he pitied their blindneſs; by degrees he was provoked at their obſtinacy; and he inſenſibly hated thoſe ſectaries to whom he was an object of hatred <note n="67" place="bottom">Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. xxv. p. 432.) inſults the perſecuting ſpirit of the Arians, as an infallible ſymptom of error and hereſy.</note>. The feeble mind of Valens was always ſwayed by the perſons with whom he familiarly converſed; and the exile or impriſonment of a private citizen are the favours the moſt readily granted in a deſpotic court. Such puniſhments were frequently inflicted on the leaders of the Homoouſian party; and the misfortune of fourſcore eccleſiaſtics of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, who, perhaps accidentally, were burnt on ſhipboard, was imputed to the cruel and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated malice of the emperor, and his Arian miniſters. In every conteſt, the catholics (if we may anticipate that name) were obliged to pay the penalty of their own faults, and of thoſe of their adverſaries. In every election, the claims of the Arian candidate obtained the preference; and if they were oppoſed by the majority of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0034700104:274"/>
people, he was uſually ſupported by the authority of the civil magiſtrate, or even by the terrors of a military force. The enemies of Athanaſius attempted to diſturb the laſt years of his vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable age; and his temporary retreat to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſepulchre has been celebrated as a fifth exile. But the zeal of a great people, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly flew to arms, intimidated the praefect; and the archbiſhop was permitted to end his life in peace and in glory, after a reign of forty-ſeven years. The death of Athanaſius was the ſignal <note place="margin">Death of Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, A. D. 373.

Yet candour may diſcover ſome reaſons to ſuſpect that the eccleſiaſtical miniſters of Valens often exceeded the orders, or even the intentions, of

The ſilence of Valentinian may ſuggeſt a probable argument, that the partial ſeverities, which were exerciſed in the name and provinces of his colleague, amounted only to ſome obſcure and inconſiderable deviations from the eſtabliſhed ſyſtem of religious toleration: and the judicious hiſtorian, who has praiſed the equal temper of the elder brother, has not thought himſelf obliged to contraſt the tranquillity of the Weſt with the cruel perſecution of the Eaſt <note n="70" place="bottom">This reflexion is ſo obvious and forcible, that Oroſius (l. vii. c. 32, 33.) delays the perſecution till after the death of Valentinian. Socrates, on the other hand, ſuppoſes (l. iii. c. 32.), that it was appeaſed by a philoſophical oration, which Themiſtius pronounced in the year 374 (Orat. xii. p. 154. in Latin only). Such contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions diminiſh the evidence, and reduce the term, of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Valens.</note>. 2. Whatever credit may be allowed to vague and diſtant reports, the character, or at leaſt the behaviour, of Valens may be moſt diſtinctly ſeen in his perſonal tranſactions with the eloquent Baſil, archbiſhop of Caeſarea, who had ſucceeded Athanaſius in the management of the Trinitarian cauſe <note n="71" place="bottom">Tillemont, whom I follow and abridge, has extracted (Mem.

Damaſus, biſhop of Rome, was publicly read in the churches of the city. He admoniſhed the eccleſiaſtics and monks not to frequent the houſes of widows and virgins; and menaced their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience with the animadverſion of the civil judge. The director was no longer permitted to receive any gift, or legacy, or inheritance, from the liberality of his ſpiritual daughter: every teſtament contrary to this edict was declared null and void; and the illegal donation was confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated for the uſe of the treaſury. By a ſubſequent regulation, it ſhould ſeem, that the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions were extended to nuns and biſhops; and that all perſons of the eccleſiaſtical order were rendered incapable of receiving any teſtamentary gifts, and ſtrictly confined to the natural and legal rights of inheritance. As the guardian of domeſtic happineſs and virtue, Valentinian ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied this ſevere remedy to the growing evil. In the capital of the empire, the females of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and opulent houſes poſſeſſed a very ample ſhare of independent property: and many of thoſe devout females had embraced the doctrines of Chriſtianity, not only with the cold aſſent of the underſtanding, but with the warmth of affection, and perhaps with the eagerneſs of faſhion. They ſacrificed the pleaſures of dreſs and luxury; and renounced, for the praiſe of chaſtity, the ſoft endearments of conjugal ſociety. Some eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0034700104:279"/>
of real or apparent ſanctity, was choſen to direct their timorous conſcience, and to amuſe the vacant tenderneſs of their heart: and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded confidence, which they haſtily beſtowed, was often abuſed by knaves and enthuſiaſts; who haſtened from the extremities of the Eaſt, to enjoy, on a ſplendid theatre, the privileges of the monaſtic profeſſion. By their contempt of the world, they inſenſibly acquired its moſt deſirable advantages; the lively attachment, perhaps, of a young and beautiful woman, the delicate plenty of an opulent houſehold, and the reſpectful ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the ſlaves, the freedmen, and the clients of a ſenatorial family. The immenſe fortunes of the Roman ladies were gradually conſumed, in laviſh alms and expenſive pilgrimages; and the artful monk, who had aſſigned himſelf the firſt, or poſſibly the ſole place, in the teſtament of his ſpiritual daughter, ſtill preſumed to declare, with the ſmooth face of hypocriſy, that <hi>he</hi> was only the inſtrument of charity, and the ſteward of the poor.

The eagerneſs of the troops who preſſed him to nominate his colleague, was juſtified by the dangerous ſituation of public affairs; and Valentinian himſelf was conſcious, that the abilities of the moſt active

mind were unequal to the defence of the diſtant frontiers of an invaded monarchy.

Before Valentinian could paſs the Alps, the villages of Gaul were in flames; before his general Dagalaiphus could encounter the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni, they had ſecured the captives and the ſpoil in the foreſts of Germany. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">A. D. 366.

Two Roman counts were defeated and mortally wounded; and the ſtandard of the Heruli and Batavians fell into the hands of the conquerors, who diſplayed, with inſulting ſhouts and menaces, the trophy of their victory. The ſtandard was recovered; but the Batavians had not redeemed the ſhame of their diſgrace and flight in the eyes of their ſevere judge. It was the opinion of Valentinian, that his ſoldiers muſt learn to fear their commander, before they could ceaſe to fear the enemy. The troops were ſolemnly aſſembled: and the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Batavians were incloſed within the circle of the Imperial army. Valentinian then aſcended his tribunal: and, as if he diſdained to puniſh cowardice with death, he inflicted a ſtain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible ignominy on the officers, whoſe miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and puſillanimity were found to be the firſt occaſion of the defeat. The Batavians were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from their rank, ſtripped of their arms, and condemned to be ſold for ſlaves to the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0034700104:286"/>
higheſt bidder. At this tremendous ſentence the troops fell proſtrate on the ground; deprecated the indignation of their ſovereign; and proteſted, that, if he would indulge them in another trial, they would approve themſelves not unworthy of the name of Romans, and of his ſoldiers. Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian, with affected reluctance, yielded to their entreaties: the Batavians reſumed their arms; and with their arms, the invincible reſolution of wiping away their diſgrace in the blood of the Alemanni <note n="89" place="bottom">Ammian. xxvii. 1.

Jovinus, who had viewed the ground with the eye of a general, made his ſilent approach through a deep and woody vale, till he could diſtinctly perceive the indolent ſecurity of the Germans. Some were bathing their huge limbs in the river; others were combing their long and flaxen hair; others again were ſwallowing large draughts of rich and delicious wine.

Count Sebaſtian, with the bands of Italy and Illyricum, was ordered to invade their country, moſt probably on the ſide of Rhaetia. The emperor in perſon, accompanied by his ſon Gratian, paſſed the Rhine at the head of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable army, which was ſupported on both flanks by Jovinus and Severus, the two maſters<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general of the cavalry and infantry of the Weſt. The Alemanni, unable to prevent the devaſtation of their villages, fixed their camp on a lofty, and almoſt inacceſſible, mountain, in the modern duchy of Wirtemberg, and reſolutely expected the approach of the Romans. The life of Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian was expoſed to imminent danger, by the intrepid curioſity with which he perſiſted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore ſome ſecret and unguarded path. A troop of Barbarians ſuddenly roſe from their ambuſcade: and the emperor, who vigorouſly ſpurred his horſe down a ſteep and ſlippery deſcent, was obliged to leave behind him his armour-bearer, and his helmit, magnificently enriched with gold and precious ſtones. At the ſignal of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſault, the Roman troops encompaſſed and aſcended the mountain of Solicinium on three different ſides.

The ſolution of this difficulty is eaſily derived from the ſimilar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and looſe conſtitution, of the tribes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many; which were blended with each other by the ſlighteſt accidents of war or friendſhip. The ſituation of the native Saxons diſpoſed them to embrace the hazardous profeſſions of fiſhermen and pirates: and the ſucceſs of their firſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would naturally excite the emulation of their braveſt countrymen, who were impatient of the gloomy ſolitude of their woods and mountains. Every tide might float down the Elbe whole fleets of canoes, filled with hardy and intrepid aſſociates, who aſpired to behold the unbounded proſpect of the ocean, and to taſte the wealth and luxury of unknown worlds.

The rumour of the ſucceſsful armaments which ſailed from the mouth of the Elbe, would ſoon provoke them to croſs the narrow iſthmus of Sleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wig, and to launch their veſſels on the great ſea.

In the courſe of their ſlow and diſtant naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they muſt always have been expoſed to the danger, and very frequently to the misfortune, of ſhipwreck; and the naval annals of the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were undoubtedly filled with the accounts of the loſſes, which they ſuſtained on the coaſts of Britain and Gaul. But the daring ſpirit of the pirates braved the perils, both of the ſea, and of the ſhore: their ſkill was confirmed by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of enterprize; the meaneſt of their mariners was alike capable, of handling an oar, of rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſail, or of conducting a veſſel; and the Saxons rejoiced in the appearance of a tempeſt, which concealed their deſign, and diſperſed the fleets of the enemy <note n="105" place="bottom">The beſt original account of the Saxon pirates may be found in Sidonius Apollinaris (l. viii. epiſt. 6. p. 223. edit.

After they had acquired an accurate knowledge of the maritime provinces of the Weſt, they extended the ſcene of their depredations, and the moſt ſequeſtered places had no reaſon to preſume on their ſecurity. The Saxon boats drew ſo little water, that they could eaſily proceed fourſcore or an hundred miles up the great rivers; their weight was ſo inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that they were tranſported on waggons from one river to another; and the pirates who had entered the mouth of the Seine, or of the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0034700104:297"/>

Under the reign of Valentinian, the maritime provinces of Gaul were afflicted by the Saxons: a military count was ſtationed for the defence of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt, or Armorican limit; and that officer, who found his ſtrength, or his abilities, unequal to the taſk, implored the aſſiſtance of Severus, maſter-general of the infantry. The Saxons, ſurrounded and out-numbered, were forced to relinquiſh their ſpoil, and to yield a ſelect band of their tall and robuſt youth to ſerve in the Imperial armies. They ſtipulated only a ſafe and honourable retreat: and the condition was readily granted by the Roman general; who me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated an act of perfidy <note n="106" place="bottom">Ammian (xxviii. 5.) juſtifies this breach of faith to pirates and robbers; and Oroſius (l. vii. c. 32.) more clearly expreſſes their real guilt; virtute atque agilitate terribiles.</note>, imprudent as it was inhuman, while a Saxon remained alive, and in arms, to revenge the fate of his countrymen. The premature eagerneſs of the infantry, who were ſecretly poſted in a deep valley, betrayed the ambuſcade; and they would perhaps have fallen the victims of their own treachery, if a large body of cuiraſſiers, alarmed by the noiſe of the combat, had not haſtily advanced to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their companions, and to overwhelm the undaunted valour of the Saxons.

The eaſtern coaſt of Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia may be conſidered as a level and fertile country, which, even in a rude ſtate of tillage, was capable of producing a conſiderable quantity of corn: and the epithet of <hi>cruitnich,</hi> or wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaters, expreſſed the contempt, or envy, of the carnivorous highlander. The cultivation of the earth might introduce a more accurate ſeparation of property, and the habits of a ſedentary life; but the love of arms and rapine was ſtill the rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſion of the Picts: and their warriors, who ſtripped themſelves for a day of battle, were diſtinguiſhed, in the eyes of the Romans, by the ſtrange faſhion of painting their naked bodies, with gaudy colours and fantaſtic figures. The weſtern part of Caledonia irregularly riſes into wild and barren hills, which ſcarcely repay the toil of the huſbandman, and are moſt profitably uſed for the paſture of cattle. The highlanders were condemned to the occupations of ſhepherds and hunters; and, as they ſeldom were fixed to any permanent habitation, they acquired the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive name of SCOTS, which, in the Celtic tongue, is ſaid to be equivalent to that of <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,</hi> or <hi>vagrants.</hi> The inhabitants of a barren land were urged to ſeek a freſh ſupply of food in the waters. The deep lakes and bays which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſect their country, are plentifully ſtored with fiſh; and they gradually ventured to caſt their nets in the waves of the ocean. The vicinity of the Hebrides, ſo profuſely ſcattered along the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0034700104:301"/>
weſtern coaſt of Scotland, tempted their curioſity, and improved their ſkill; and they acquired, by ſlow degrees, the art, or rather the habit, of managing their boats in a tempeſtuous ſea, and of ſteering their nocturnal courſe by the light of the well-known ſtars. The two bold headlands of Caledonia almoſt touch the ſhores of a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious iſland, which obtained, from its luxuriant vegetation, the epithet of <hi>Green;</hi> and has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, with a ſlight alteration, the name of Erin, or Ierne, or Ireland. It is <hi>probable,</hi> that in ſome remote period of antiquity, the fertile plains of Ulſter received a colony of hungry Scots; and that the ſtrangers of the North, who had dared to encounter the arms of the legions, ſpread their conqueſts over the ſavage and unwarlike natives of a ſolitary iſland. It is <hi>certain,</hi> that, in the declining age of the Roman empire, Caledonia, Ireland, and the Iſle of Man, were inhabited by the Scots; and that the kindred tribes, who were often aſſociated in military enterprize, were deeply affected by the various accidents of their mutual fortunes. They long cheriſhed the lively tradition of their common name and origin: and the miſſionaries of the Iſle of Saints, who diffuſed the light of Chriſtianity over North Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, eſtabliſhed the vain opinion, that their Iriſh countrymen were the natural, as well as ſpiritual, fathers of the Scottiſh race. The looſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure tradition has been preſerved by the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Bede, who ſcattered ſome rays of light over the darkneſs of the eighth century. On this

ſlight foundation, an huge ſuperſtructure of fable was gradually reared, by the bards, and the monks; two orders of men, who equally abuſed the privilege of fiction. The Scottiſh nation, with miſtaken pride, adopted their Iriſh genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy: and the annals of a long line of imaginary kings have been adorned by the fancy of Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius, and the claſſic elegance of Buchanan <note n="111" place="bottom">The Iriſh deſcent of the Scots has been revived, in the laſt moments of its decay, and ſtrenuouſly ſupported, by the Rev.

Severus,

count of the domeſtics, was haſtily diſpatched, and as ſuddenly recalled, by the court of Treves. The repreſentations of Jovinus ſerved only to indicate the greatneſs of the evil; and, after a long and ſerious conſultation, the defence, or rather the recovery, of Britain, was entruſted to the abilities of the brave Theodoſius. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits of that general, the father of a line of emperors, have been celebrated, with peculiar complacency, by the writers of the age: but his real merit deſerved their applauſe; and his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was received, by the army and province, as a ſure preſage of approaching victory. He ſeized the favourable moment of navigation, and ſecurely landed the numerous and veteran bands of the Heruli and Batavians, the Jovians and the Victors. In his march from Sandwich to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Theodoſius defeated ſeveral parties of the Barbarians, releaſed a multitude of captives, and, after diſtributing to his ſoldiers a ſmall portion of the ſpoil, eſtabliſhed the fame of diſintereſted juſtice, by the reſtitution of the remainder to the rightful proprietors. The citizens of London, who had almoſt deſpaired of their ſafety, threw open their gates; and as ſoon as Theodoſius had obtained from the court of Treves the important aid of a military lieutenant, and a civil governor, he executed, with wiſdom and vigour, the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious taſk of the deliverance of Britain. The vagrant ſoldiers were recalled to their ſtandard; an edict of amneſty diſpelled the public appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions; and his cheerful example alleviated the

The ſcattered and deſultory warfare of the Barbarians, who infeſted the land and ſea, deprived him of the glory of a ſignal victory; but the prudent ſpirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate art, of the Roman general, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the operations of two campaigns, <note place="margin">A.

and the vines and fruit-trees of that rich territory were extirpated by the malicious ſavages of Getulia. The unhappy provincials implored the protection of Romanus; but they ſoon found that their military governor was not leſs cruel and rapacious than the Barbarians. As they were incapable of furniſhing the four thouſand camels, and the exorbitant preſent, which he required, before he would march to the aſſiſtance of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli; his demand was equivalent to a refuſal, and he might juſtly be accuſed as the author of the public calamity. In the annual aſſembly of the three cities, they nominated two deputies, to lay at the feet of Valentinian the cuſtomary offering of a gold victory; and to accompany this tribute, of duty, rather than of gratitude, with their humble complaint, that they were ruined by the enemy, and betrayed by their governor. If the ſeverity of Valentinian had been rightly directed, it would have fallen on the guilty head of Romanus. But the Count, long exerciſed in the arts of corruption, had diſpatched a ſwift and truſty meſſenger to ſecure the venal friendſhip of Remigius, maſter of the offices. The wiſdom of the Imperial council was deceived by artifice; and their honeſt indignation was cooled by delay. At length, when the repetition of complaint had been juſtified by the repetition of public misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, the notary Palladius was ſent from the court of Treves, to examine the ſtate of Africa, and the conduct of Romanus. The rigid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality of Palladius was eaſily diſarmed: he
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0034700104:310"/>
was tempted to reſerve for himſelf a part of the public treaſure, which he brought with him for the payment of the troops; and from the moment that he was conſcious of his own guilt, he could no longer refuſe to atteſt the innocence and merit of the Count. The charge of the Tripolitans was declared to be falſe and frivolous; and Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius himſelf was ſent back from Treves to Africa, with a ſpecial commiſſion, to diſcover and proſecute the authors of this impious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt the repreſentatives of the ſovereign. His enquiries were managed with ſo much dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and ſucceſs, that he compelled the citizens of Leptis, who had ſuſtained a recent ſiege of eight days, to contradict the truth of their own decrees, and to cenſure the behaviour of their own deputies. A bloody ſentence was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, without heſitation, by the raſh and headſtrong cruelty of Valentinian. The preſident of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli, who had preſumed to pity the diſtreſs of the province, was publicly executed at Utica; four diſtinguiſhed citizens were put to death, as the accomplices of the imaginary fraud; and the tongues of two others were cut out, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs order of the emperor.

The ruin of Caeſarea, which was plundered and burnt by the licentious Barbarians, convinced the refractory cities of the danger of reſiſtance; the power of Firmus was eſtabliſhed, at leaſt in the provinces of Mauritania and Numidia; and it ſeemed to be his only doubt, whether he ſhould aſſume the diadem of a Mooriſh king, or the purple of a Roman emperor. But the imprudent
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0034700104:312"/>
and unhappy Africans ſoon diſcovered, that, in this raſh inſurrection, they had not ſufficiently conſulted their own ſtrength, or the abilities of their leader. Before he could procure any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain intelligence, that the emperor of the Weſt had fixed the choice of a general, or that a fleet of tranſports was collected at the mouth of the Rhone, he was ſuddenly informed, that the great <note place="margin">Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, A.

Though Firmus poſſeſſed arms and treaſures, his deſpair of victory immediately reduced him to the uſe of thoſe arts, which, in the ſame country, and in a ſimilar ſituation, had formerly been practiſed by the crafty Jugurtha. He attempted to deceive, by an apparent ſubmiſſion, the vigilance of the Roman general; to ſeduce the fidelity of his troops; and to protract the duration of the war, by ſucceſſively engaging the independent tribes of Africa to eſpouſe his quarrel, or to protect his flight. Theodoſius imitated the example, and obtained the ſucceſs, of his predeceſſor Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus. When Firmus, in the character of a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant, accuſed his own raſhneſs, and humbly ſolicited the clemency of the emperor, the lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of Valentinian received and diſmiſſed him with a friendly embrace; but he diligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the uſeful and ſubſtantial pledges of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere repentance; nor could he be perſuaded, by the aſſurances of peace, to ſuſpend, for an
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0034700104:313"/>
inſtant, the operations of an active war. A dark conſpiracy was detected by the penetration of Theodoſius; and he ſatisfied, without much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, the public indignation, which he had ſecretly excited. Several of the guilty accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices of Firmus were abandoned, according to ancient cuſtom, to the tumult of a military exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; many more, by the amputation of both their hands, continued to exhibit an inſtructive ſpectacle of horror; the hatred of the rebels was accompanied with fear; and the fear of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoldiers was mingled with reſpectful admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Amidſt the boundleſs plains of Getulia, and the innumerable vallies of Mount Atlas, it was impoſſible to prevent the eſcape of Firmus: and if the uſurper could have tired the patience of his antagoniſt, he would have ſecured his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the depth of ſome remote ſolitude, and expected the hopes of a future revolution. He was ſubdued by the perſeverance of Theodoſius; who had formed an inflexible determination, that the war ſhould end only by the death of the tyrant, and that every nation of Africa, which preſumed to ſupport his cauſe, ſhould be involved in his ruin. At the head of a ſmall body of troops, which ſeldom exceeded three thouſand five hundred men, the Roman general advanced, with a ſteady prudence, devoid of raſhneſs, or of fear, into the heart of a country, where he was ſometimes attacked by armies of twenty thouſand Moors. The boldneſs of his charge diſmayed the irregular Barbarians; they were diſconcerted

When Theodoſius entered the extenſive dominions of Igmazen, king of the Iſaflenſes, the haughty ſavage required, in words of defiance, his name, and the object of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. <q>I am, replied the ſtern and diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful count, I am the general of Valentinian, the lord of the world; who has ſent me hither to purſue and puniſh a deſperate robber.

About the ſame time, the reſtorer of Britain and Africa, on a vague ſuſpicion that his name and ſervices were ſuperior to the rank of a ſubject, was ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly beheaded at Carthage.

But the tedious enumeration of the unknown and unintereſting tribes of Africa may be reduced to the general remark, that they were all of the ſwarthy race of the Moors; that they inhabited the back ſettlements of the Mauritanian and Numidian provinces, the country, as they have ſince been termed by the Arabs, of dates and of locuſts <note n="125" place="bottom">Leo Africanus (in the Viaggi di Ramuſio, tom. i. fol. 78—83.) has traced a curious picture of the people and the country; which are more minutely deſcribed in the Afrique de Marmol. tom. iii. p. 1—54.</note>; and that, as the Roman power declined in Africa, the boundary of civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed manners and cultivated land was inſenſibly contracted. Beyond the utmoſt limits of the Moors, the vaſt and inhoſpitable deſert of the South extends above a thouſand miles to the banks of the Niger.

territories at the head of a formidable hoſt of cuiraſſiers, of archers, and of mercenary foot; but it was the invariable practice of Sapor to mix war and negociation, and to conſider falſehood and perjury as the moſt powerful inſtruments of regal policy. He affected to praiſe the prudent and moderate conduct of the king of Armenia; and the unſuſpicious Tiranus was perſuaded, by the repeated aſſurances of inſidious friendſhip, to deliver his perſon into the hands of a faithleſs and cruel enemy. In the midſt of a ſplendid enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, he was bound in chains of ſilver, as an honour due to the blood of the Arſacides; and, after a ſhort confinement in the Tower of Oblivion at Ecbatana, he was releaſed from the miſeries of life, either by his own dagger, or by that of an aſſaſſin. The kingdom of Armenia was reduced to the ſtate of a Perſian province; the adminiſtration was ſhared between a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed ſatrap and a favourite eunuch; and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por marched, without delay, to ſubdue the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſpirit of the Iberians.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0034700104:320"/>
to reſiſt the effort of his arms. The treaſure depoſited in that ſtrong fortreſs tempted the avarice of Sapor; but the danger of Olympias, the wife, or widow, of the Armenian king, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the public compaſſion, and animated the deſperate valour of her ſubjects and ſoldiers. The Perſians were ſurpriſed and repulſed under the walls of Artogeraſſa, by a bold and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted ſally of the beſieged. But the forces of Sapor were continually renewed and increaſed; the hopeleſs courage of the garriſon was exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the ſtrength of the walls yielded to the aſſault; and the proud conqueror, after waſting the rebellious city with fire and ſword, led away captive an unfortunate queen; who, in a more auſpicious hour, had been the deſtined bride of the ſon of Conſtantine <note n="135" place="bottom">Tillemont (Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 701.) proves, from chronology, that Olympias muſt have been the mother of Para.</note>. Yet if Sapor already triumphed in the eaſy conqueſt of two dependent kingdoms, he ſoon felt, that a country is unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, as long as the minds of the people are actuated by an hoſtile and contumacious ſpirit. The ſatraps, whom he was obliged to truſt, embraced the firſt opportunity of regaining the affection of their countrymen, and of ſignaliſing their immortal hatred to the Perſian name. Since the converſion of the Armenians and Iberians, thoſe nations conſidered the Chriſtians as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, and the Magians as the adverſaries, of the Supreme Being; the influence of the clergy, over a ſuperſtitious people, was uniformly exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0034700104:321"/>
in the cauſe of Rome; and as long as the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of Conſtantine diſputed with thoſe of Artaxerxes the ſovereignty of the intermediate provinces, the religious connexion always threw a deciſive advantage into the ſcale of the empire. A numerous and active party acknowledged Para, the ſon of Tiranus, as the lawful ſovereign of Armenia; and his title to the throne was deeply rooted in the hereditary ſucceſſion of five hundred years. By the unanimous conſent of the Iberians, the country was equally divided between the rival princes; and Aſpacuras, who owed his diadem to the choice of Sapor, was obliged to declare, that his regard for his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, who were detained as hoſtages by the tyrant, was the only conſideration, which prevented him from openly renouncing the alliance of Perſia. The emperor Valens, who reſpected the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the treaty, and who was apprehenſive of involving the Eaſt in a dangerous war, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, with ſlow and cautious meaſures, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Roman party in the kingdoms of Iberia and Armenia. Twelve legions eſtabliſhed the authority of Sauromaces on the banks of the Cyrus. The Euphrates was protected by the valour of Arintheus. A powerful army, under the command of count Trajan, and of Vadomair, king of the Alemanni, fixed their camp on the confines of Armenia. But they were ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, not to commit the firſt hoſtilities, which might be underſtood as a breach of the treaty: and ſuch was the implicit obedience of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

general, that they retreated, with exemplary patience, under a ſhower of Perſian arrows, till they had clearly acquired a juſt title to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and legitimate victory. Yet theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of war inſenſibly ſubſided in a vain and tedious negociation. The contending parties ſupported their claims by mutual reproaches of perfidy and ambition; and it ſhould ſeem, that the original treaty was expreſſed in very obſcure terms, ſince they were reduced to the neceſſity of making their inconcluſive appeal to the partial teſtimony of the generals of the two nations, who had aſſiſted at the negociations <note n="136" place="bottom">Ammianus (xxvii. 12. xxix. 1. xxx. 1, 2.) has deſcribed the events, without the dates, of the Perſian war.

The noble youth, by the perſuaſion of his mother Olympias, had eſcaped through the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian hoſt that beſieged Artogeraſſa, and implored the protection of the emperor of the Eaſt. By his timid councils, Para was alternately ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and recalled, and reſtored, and betrayed. The hopes of the Armenians were ſometimes raiſed by the preſence of their natural ſovereign; and the miniſters of Valens were ſatisfied, that they preſerved the integrity of the public ſaith, if their vaſſal was not ſuffered to aſſume the diadem and title of King. But they ſoon repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their own raſhneſs. They were confounded by the reproaches and threats of the Perſian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. They found reaſon to diſtruſt the cruel and inconſtant temper of Para himſelf: who
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0034700104:324"/>
ſacrificed, to the ſlighteſt ſuſpicions, the lives of his moſt faithful ſervants; and held a ſecret and diſgraceful correſpondence with the aſſaſſin of his father, and the enemy of his country. Under the ſpecious pretence of conſulting with the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror on the ſubject of their common intereſt, Para was perſuaded to deſcend from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Armenia, where his party was in arms, and to truſt his independence and ſafety to the diſcretion of a perfidious court. The king of Armenia, for ſuch he appeared in his own eyes and in thoſe of his nation, was received with due honours by the governors of the provinces through which he paſſed; but when he arrived at Tarſus in Cilicia, his progreſs was ſtopped under various pretences; his motions were watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with reſpectful vigilance; and he gradually diſcovered, that he was a priſoner in the hands of the Romans. Para ſuppreſſed his indignation, diſſembled his fears, and, after ſecretly preparing his eſcape, mounted on horſeback with three hundred of his faithful followers. The officer ſtationed at the door of his apartment imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately communicated his flight to the conſular of Cilicia, who overtook him in the ſuburbs, and endeavoured, without ſucceſs, to diſſuade him from proſecuting his raſh and dangerous deſign. A legion was ordered to purſue the royal fugitive; but the purſuit of infantry could not be very alarming to a body of light cavalry; and upon the firſt cloud of arrows that was diſcharged into the air, they retreated with precipitation to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0034700104:325"/>
the gates of Tarſus. After an inceſſant march of two days and two nights, Para and his Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians reached the banks of the Euphrates; but the paſſage of the river, which they were obliged to ſwim, was attended with ſome delay and ſome loſs. The country was alarmed; and the two roads, which were only ſeparated by an interval of three miles, had been occupied by a thouſand archers on horſeback, under the command of a count and a tribune. Para muſt have yielded to ſuperior force, if the accidental arrival of a friendly traveller had not revealed the danger, and the means of eſcape. A dark and almoſt impervious path ſecurely conveyed the Armenian troop through the thicket; and Para had left behind him the count and the tribune, while they pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently expected his approach along the public highways. They returned to the Imperial court to excuſe their want of diligence or ſucceſs: and ſeriouſly alleged, that the king of Armenia, who was a ſkilful magician, had transformed himſelf and his followers, and paſſed before their eyes under a borrowed ſhape. After his return to his native kingdom, Para ſtill continued to profeſs himſelf the friend and ally of the Romans; but the Romans had injured him too deeply ever to forgive, and the ſecret ſentence of his death was ſigned in the council of Valens. The execution of the bloody deed was committed to the ſubtle prudence of Count Trajan; and he had the merit of inſinuating himſelf into the confidence of the credulous prince, that he might find an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0034700104:326"/>
of ſtabbing him to the heart. Para was invited to a Roman banquet, which had been prepared with all the pomp and ſenſuality of the Eaſt: the hall reſounded with cheerful muſic, and the company was already heated with wine; when the count retired for an inſtant, drew his ſword, and gave the ſignal of the murder. A robuſt and deſperate Barbarian inſtantly ruſhed on the king of Armenia; and though he bravely defended his life with the firſt weapon that chance offered to his hand, the table of the Imperial <note place="margin">A.

Such were the weak and wicked maxims of the Roman adminiſtration, that, to attain a doubtful object of political inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, the laws of nations, and the ſacred rights of hoſpitality, were inhumanly violated in the face of the world <note n="139" place="bottom">See in Ammianus (xxx. 1.) the adventures of Para.

the number of thirty thouſand men <note n="145" place="bottom">M. de Buat (Hiſt. des Peuples de l'Europe, tom. vi. p. 332.) has curiouſly aſcertained the real number of theſe auxiliaries. The 3000 of Ammianus, and the 10,000 of Zoſimus, were only the firſt diviſions of the Gothic army.</note>. They marched with the proud confidence, that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible valour would decide the fate of the Roman empire; and the provinces of Thrace groaned under the weight of the Barbarians, who diſplayed the inſolence of maſters, and the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of enemies. But the intemperance which gratified their appetites, retarded their progreſs; and before the Goths could receive any certain intelligence of the defeat and death of Procopius, they perceived, by the hoſtile ſtate of the country, that the civil and military powers were reſumed by his ſucceſsful rival. A chain of poſts and fortifications, ſkilfully diſpoſed by Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens, or the generals of Valens, reſiſted their march, prevented their retreat, and intercepted their ſubſiſtence. The fierceneſs of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians was tamed and ſuſpended by hunger: they indignantly threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror, who offered them food and chains: the numerous captives were diſtributed in all the cities of the Eaſt; and the provincials, who were ſoon familiarized with their ſavage appearance, ventured, by degrees, to meaſure their own ſtrength with theſe formidable adverſaries, whoſe name had ſo long been the object of their terror. The king of Scythia (and Hermanric alone could deſerve ſo lofty a title) was grieved and exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated by this national calamity. His ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0034700104:331"/>
loudly complained, at the court of Valens, of the infraction of the ancient and ſolemn alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which had ſo long ſubſiſted between the Romans and the Goths. They alleged, that they had fulfilled the duty of allies, by aſſiſting the kinſman and ſucceſſor of the emperor Julian; they required the immediate reſtitution of the noble captives; and they urged a very ſingular claim, that the Gothic generals, marching in arms, and in hoſtile array, were entitled to the ſacred character and privileges of ambaſſadors. The decent, but peremptory, refuſal of theſe extravagant demands, was ſignified to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians by Victor, maſter-general of the cavalry; who expreſſed, with force and dignity, the juſt complaints of the Emperor of the Eaſt <note n="146" place="bottom">The march, and ſubſequent negociation, are deſcribed in the Fragments of Eunapius (Excerpt.

but the events ſcarcely deſerve the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of poſterity, except as the preliminary ſteps of the approaching decline and fall of the empire. Inſtead of leading the nations of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many and Scythia to the banks of the Danube, or even to the gates of Conſtantinople, the aged monarch of the Goths reſigned to the brave Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naric the danger and glory of a defenſive war, againſt an enemy, who wielded with a feeble hand the powers of a mighty ſtate. A bridge of boats was eſtabliſhed upon the Danube; the preſence of Valens animated his troops; and his ignorance of the art of war was compenſated by perſonal bravery, and a wiſe deference to the advice of Victor and Arintheus, his maſters-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the cavalry and infantry. The operations of the campaign were conducted by their ſkill and experience; but they found it impoſſible to drive the Viſigoths from their ſtrong poſts in the mountains: and the devaſtation of the plains obliged the Romans themſelves to repaſs the Danube on the approach of winter. The inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant rains, which ſwelled the waters of the river, produced a tacit ſuſpenſion of arms, and confined the emperor Valens, during the whole courſe of the enſuing ſummer, to his camp of Marciana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis. The third year of the war was more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the Romans, and more pernicious to the Goths. The interruption of trade deprived
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0034700104:333"/>
the Barbarians of the objects of luxury, which they already confounded with the neceſſaries of life; and the deſolation of a very extenſive tract of country threatened them with the horrors of famine. Athanaric was provoked, or compelled, to riſk a battle, which he loſt, in the plains; and the purſuit was rendered more bloody by the cruel precaution of the victorious generals, who had promiſed a large reward for the head of every Goth, that was brought into the Imperial camp. The ſubmiſſion of the Barbarians appeaſed the reſentment of Valens and his council; the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror liſtened with ſatisfaction to the flattering and eloquent remonſtrance of the ſenate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, which aſſumed, for the firſt time, a ſhare in the public deliberations; and the ſame generals, Victor and Arintheus, who had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully directed the conduct of the war, were empowered to regulate the conditions of peace. The freedom of trade, which the Goths had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto enjoyed, was reſtricted to two cities on the Danube; the raſhneſs of their leaders was ſeverely puniſhed by the ſuppreſſion of their penſions and ſubſidies; and the exception, which was ſtipulated in favour of Athanaric alone, was more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous than honourable to the Judge of the Viſigoths. Athanaric, who, on this occaſion, appears to have conſulted his private intereſt, without expecting the orders of his ſovereign, ſupported his own dignity, and that of his tribe, in the perſonal interview which was propoſed by the miniſters of Valens. He perſiſted in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that it was impoſſible for him, without
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0034700104:334"/>
incurring the guilt of perjury, ever to ſet his foot on the territory of the empire; and it is more than probable, that his regard for the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of an oath was confirmed by the recent and fatal examples of Roman treachery. The Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube, which ſeparated the dominions of the two independent nations, was choſen for the ſcene of the conference. The Emperor of the Eaſt, and the Judge of the Viſigoths, accompanied by an equal number of armed followers, advanced in their reſpective barges to the middle of the ſtream. After the ratification of the treaty, and the delivery of hoſtages, Valens returned in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to Conſtantinople; and the Goths remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſtate of tranquillity about ſix years; till they were violently impelled againſt the Roman empire, by an innumerable hoſt of Scythians, who appeared to iſſue from the frozen regions of the North <note n="149" place="bottom">The Gothic war is deſcribed by Ammianus (xxvii. 5.), Zoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus (l. iv. p. 211—214.), and Themiſtius (Orat. x. p. 129—141.).

            <p>The Emperor of the Weſt, who had reſigned <note place="margin">War of the Quadi and Sarmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, A. D. 374.</note> to his brother the command of the Lower Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube, reſerved for his immediate care the defence of the Rhaetian and Illyrian provinces, which ſpread ſo many hundred miles along the greateſt of the European rivers. The active policy of Valentinian was continually employed in adding new fortifications to the ſecurity of the frontier:
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0034700104:335"/>
but the abuſe of this policy provoked the juſt reſentment of the Barbarians. The Quadi com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that the ground for an intended fortreſs had been marked out on their territories; and their complaints were urged with ſo much reaſon and moderation, that Equitius, maſter-general of Illyricum, conſented to ſuſpend the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the work, till he ſhould be more clearly informed of the will of his ſovereign. This fair occaſion of injuring a rival, and of advancing the fortune of his ſon, was eagerly embraced by the inhuman Maximin, the praefect, or rather ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, of Gaul. The paſſions of Valentinian were impatient of controul; and he credulouſly liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the aſſurances of his favourite, that if the government of Valeria, and the direction of the work, were entruſted to the zeal of his ſon Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus, the emperor ſhould no longer be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned with the audacious remonſtrances of the Barbarians. The ſubjects of Rome, and the natives of Germany, were inſulted by the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of a young and worthleſs miniſter, who conſidered his rapid elevation as the proof and reward of his ſuperior merit. He affected, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to receive the modeſt application of Gabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, king of the Quadi, with ſome attention and regard: but this artful civility concealed a dark and bloody deſign, and the credulous prince was perſuaded to accept the preſſing invitation of Marcellinus. I am at a loſs how to vary the narrative of ſimilar crimes; or how to relate, that, in the courſe of the ſame year, but in remote parts of the empire, the inhoſpitable table
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0034700104:336"/>
of two Imperial generals was ſtained with the royal blood of two gueſts and allies, inhumanly murdered by their order, and in their preſence. The fate of Gabinius, and of Para, was the ſame: but the cruel death of their ſovereign was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in a very different manner by the ſervile temper of the Armenians, and the free and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit of the Germans. The Quadi were much declined from that formidable power, which, in the time of Marcus Antoninus, had ſpread terror to the gates of Rome. But they ſtill poſſeſſed arms and courage; their courage was animated by deſpair, and they obtained the uſual reinforcement of the cavalry of their Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matian allies. So improvident was the aſſaſſin Marcellinus, that he choſe the moment when the braveſt veterans had been drawn away, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the revolt of Firmus; and the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was expoſed, with a very feeble defence, to the rage of the exaſperated Barbarians. They invaded Pannonia in the ſeaſon of harveſt; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully deſtroyed every object of plunder which they could not eaſily tranſport; and either diſregarded, or demoliſhed, the empty fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The princeſs Conſtantia, the daughter of the emperor Conſtantius, and the grand-daughter of the great Conſtantine, very narrowly eſcaped. That royal maid, who had innocently ſupported the revolt of Procopius, was now the deſtined wife of the heir of the Weſtern empire. She traverſed the peaceful province with a ſplendid and unarmed train. Her perſon was ſaved from
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0034700104:337"/>
danger, and the republic from diſgrace, by the active zeal of Meſſala, governor of the provinces. As ſoon as he was informed that the village, where ſhe ſtopped only to dine, was almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed by the Barbarians, he haſtily placed her in his own chariot, and drove full ſpeed till he reached the gates of Sirmium, which were at the diſtance of ſix and twenty miles. Even Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium might not have been ſecure, if the Quadi and Sarmatians had diligently advanced during the general conſternation of the magiſtrates and people. Their delay allowed Probus, the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian praefect, ſufficient time to recover his own ſpirits, and to revive the courage of the citizens. He ſkilfully directed their ſtrenuous efforts to repair and ſtrengthen the decayed fortifications; and procured the ſeaſonable and effectual aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a company of archers, to protect the capital of the Illyrian provinces. Diſappointed in their attempts againſt the walls of Sirmium, the indignant Barbarians turned their arms againſt the maſter-general of the frontier, to whom they unjuſtly attributed the murder of their king. Equitius could bring into the field no more than two legions; but they contained the veteran ſtrength of the Maeſian and Pannonian bands. The obſtinacy with which they diſputed the vain honours of rank and precedency, was the cauſe of their deſtruction; and, while they acted with ſeparate forces and divided councils, they were ſurpriſed and ſlaughtered by the active vigour of the Sarmatian horſe. The ſucceſs of this inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0034700104:338"/>
provoked the emulation of the bordering tribes; and the province of Maeſia would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly have been loſt, if young Theodoſius, the duke, or military commander, of the frontier, had not ſignaliſed, in the defeat of the public enemy, an intrepid genius, worthy of his illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious father, and of his future greatneſs <note n="150" place="bottom">Ammianus (xxix. 6.) and Zoſimus (l. iv. p. 219, 220.) carefully mark the origin and progreſs of the Quadic and Sarmatian war.</note>.</p>
            <p>The mind of Valentinian, who then reſided at <note place="margin">The expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</note> Treves, was deeply affected by the calamities of Illyricum; but the lateneſs of the ſeaſon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the execution of his deſigns till the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing ſpring. He marched in perſon, with a <note place="margin">A. D. 375.</note> conſiderable part of the forces of Gaul, from the banks of the Moſelle: and to the ſuppliant am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the Sarmatians, who met him on the way, he returned a doubtful anſwer, that, as ſoon as he reached the ſcene of action, he ſhould examine, and pronounce. When he arrived at Sirmium, he gave audience to the deputies of the Illyrian provinces; who loudly congratulated their own felicity under the auſpicious govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Probus, his Praetorian praefect <note n="151" place="bottom">Ammianus (xxx. 5.), who acknowledges the merit, has cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, with becoming aſperity, the oppreſſive adminiſtration of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius Probus. When Jerom tranſlated, and continued, the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of Euſebius (A. D. 380. See Tillemont, Mem.

He forgot the provocation, remembered only the injury, and advanced into the country of the Quadi with an inſatiate thirſt of blood and revenge. The extreme devaſtation, and promiſcuous maſſacre, of a ſavage war, were juſtified, in the eyes of the emperor, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in thoſe of the world, by the cruel equity of retaliation <note n="153" place="bottom">Ammian. xxx. 5.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0034700104:340"/>
the Romans, and the conſternation of the enemy, that Valentinian repaſſed the Danube without the loſs of a ſingle man. As he had reſolved to complete the deſtruction of the Quadi by a ſecond campaign, he fixed his winter-quarters at Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getio, on the Danube, near the Hungarian city of Preſburgh. While the operations of war were ſuſpended by the ſeverity of the weather, the Quadi made an humble attempt to deprecate the wrath of their conqueror; and, at the earneſt perſuaſion of Equitius, their ambaſſadors were introduced into the Imperial council. They approached the throne with bended bodies, and dejected countenances; and, without daring to complain of the murder of their king, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, with ſolemn oaths, that the late invaſion was the crime of ſome irregular robbers, which the public council of the nation condemned and abhorred. The anſwer of the emperor left them but little to hope from his clemency or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. He reviled, in the moſt intemperate language, their baſeneſs, their ingratitude, their inſolence.—His eyes, his voice, his colour, his geſtures, expreſſed the violence of his ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fury; and, while his whole frame was agitated with convulſive paſſion, a large blood-veſſel ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly burſt in his body; and Valentinian fell ſpeechleſs into the arms of his attendants.

without ſucceſs, to declare his intentions to the generals and miniſters, who ſurrounded the royal couch. Valentinian was about fifty-four years of <note place="margin">A. D. 375.

They contrived the moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pretences to remove the popular leaders, and the troops of Gaul, who might have aſſerted the claims of the lawful ſucceſſor: they ſuggeſted the neceſſity of extinguiſhing the hopes of foreign and domeſtic enemies, by a bold and deciſive meaſure. The empreſs Juſtina, who had been left in a palace about one hundred miles from Bregetio, was reſpectfully invited to appear in the camp, with the ſon of the deceaſed emperor. On the ſixth day after the death of Valentinian, the infant prince of the ſame name, who was only four years old, was ſhewn, in the arms of his mother, to the legions; and ſolemnly inveſted, by military acclamation, with the titles and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of ſupreme power. The impending dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of a civil war were ſeaſonably prevented by the wiſe and moderate conduct of the emperor Gratian.

            <p>IN the ſecond year of the reign of Valentinian and Valens, on the morning of the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firſt day of July, the greateſt part of the Roman <note place="margin">Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, A. D. 365, July 21ſt.</note> world was ſhaken by a violent and deſtructive earthquake. The impreſſion was communicated to the waters; the ſhores of the Mediterranean were left dry, by the ſudden retreat of the ſea; great quantities of fiſh were caught with the hand; large veſſels were ſtranded on the mud; and a curious ſpectator <note n="1" place="bottom">Such is the bad taſte of Ammianus (xxvi. 10.), that it is not eaſy to diſtinguiſh his facts from his metaphors. Yet he poſitively affirms, that he ſaw the rotten carcaſe of a ſhip, ad <hi>ſecundum lapidmi,</hi> at Methone, or Modon, in Peloponneſus.</note> amuſed his eye, or rather his fancy, by contemplating the various appearance of vallies and mountains, which had never, ſince the formation of the globe, been expoſed to the ſun. But the tide ſoon returned, with the weight of an immenſe and irreſiſtible deluge, which was ſeverely felt on the coaſts of Sicily, of Dalmatia, of Greece, and of Egypt: large boats were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and lodged on the roofs of houſes, or
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0034700104:346"/>
at the diſtance of two miles from the ſhore; the people, with their habitations, were ſwept away by the waters; and the city of Alexandria an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually commemorated the fatal day, on which fifty thouſand perſons had loſt their lives in the inundation. This calamity, the report of which was magnified from one province to another, aſtoniſhed and terrified the ſubjects of Rome; and their affrighted imagination enlarged the real extent of a momentary evil. They recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the preceding earthquakes, which had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the cities of Paleſtine and Bithynia: they conſidered theſe alarming ſtrokes as the prelude only of ſtill more dreadful calamities, and their fearful vanity was diſpoſed to confound the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a declining empire, and a ſinking world <note n="2" place="bottom">The earthquakes and inundations are variouſly deſcribed by Libanius (Orat. de ulciſcendâ Juliani nece, c. x. in Fabricius, Bibl. Graec. tom. vii. p. 158. with a learned note of Olearius), Zoſimus (l. iv. p. 221.), Sozomen (l. vi. c. 2.), Cedrenus (p. 310. 314.), and Jerom (in Chron. p. 186. and tom. i. p. 250. in Vit. Hilarion.). Epidaurus muſt have been overwhelmed, had not the prudent citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens placed St. Hilarion, an Egyptian monk, on the beach. He made the ſign of the croſs. The mountain wave ſtopped, bowed, and returned.</note>. It was the faſhion of the times, to attribute every remarkable event to the particular will of the Deity; the alterations of nature were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, by an inviſible chain, with the moral and metaphyſical opinions of the human mind; and the moſt ſagacious divines could diſtinguiſh, according to the colour of their reſpective pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, that the eſtabliſhment of hereſy tended to produce an earthquake; or that a deluge was
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0034700104:347"/>
the inevitable conſequence of the progreſs of ſin and error. Without preſuming to diſcuſs the truth or propriety of theſe lofty ſpeculations, the hiſtorian may content himſelf with an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſeems to be juſtified by experience, that man has much more to fear from the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his fellow-creatures, than from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of the elements <note n="3" place="bottom">Dicaearchus, the Peripatetic, compoſed a formal treatiſe, to prove this obvious truth; which is not the moſt honourable to the human ſpecies (Cicero, de Officiis, ii. 5.).</note>. The miſchievous effects of an earthquake, or deluge, a hurricane, or the eruption of a volcano, bear a very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable proportion to the ordinary calamities of war; as they are now moderated by the prudence or humanity of the princes of Europe, who amuſe their own leiſure, and exerciſe the courage of their ſubjects, in the practice of the military art. But the laws and manners of modern nations protect the ſafety and freedom of the vanquiſhed ſoldier; and the peaceful citizen had ſeldom rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain, that his life, or even his fortune, is expoſed to the rage of war. In the diſaſtrous period of the fall of the Roman empire, which may juſtly be dated from the reign of Valens, the happineſs and ſecurity of each individual were perſonally attacked; and the arts and labours of ages were rudely defaced by the Barbarians of Scythia and Germany. The invaſion of the <note place="margin">The Huns and Goths, A. D. 376.</note> Huns precipitated on the provinces of the Weſt the Gothic nation, which advanced, in leſs than forty years, from the Danube to the Atlantic, and opened a way, by the ſucceſs of their arms,

But the operation of inſtinct is more ſure and ſimple than that of reaſon: it is much eaſier to aſcertain the appetites of a quadruped, than the ſpeculations of a philoſopher; and the ſavage tribes of mankind, as they approach nearer to the condition of animals, preſerve a ſtronger reſemblance to themſelves and to each other. The uniform ſtability of their manners, is the natural conſequence of the imperfection of their faculties. Reduced to a ſimilar ſituation, their

In every age, the immenſe plains of Scythia, or Tartary, have been inhabited by vagrant tribes of hunters and ſhepherds, whoſe indolence refuſes to cultivate the earth, and whoſe reſtleſs ſpirit diſdains the confinement of a ſedentary life. In every age, the Scythians, and Tartars, have been renowned for their invincible courage, and rapid conqueſts. The thrones of Aſia have been repeatedly overturned by the ſhepherds of the North; and their arms have ſpread terror and devaſtation over the moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and warlike countries of Europe <note n="6" place="bottom">Imperium Aſiae <hi>ter</hi> quaeſivere: ipſi perpetuo ab alieno Imperio, aut intacti, aut invicti, manſere.

On this occaſion, as well as on many others, the ſober hiſtorian is forcibly awakened from a pleaſing viſion; and is compelled, with ſome reluctance, to confeſs, that the paſtoral manners, which have been adorned with the faireſt attributes of peace and innocence, are much better adapted to the fierce and cruel habits of a military life. To illuſtrate this obſervation, I ſhall now proceed to conſider a nation of ſhepherds and of warriors,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0034700104:350"/>
in the three important articles of, I. Their diet; II. Their habitation; and, III. Their exerciſes. The narratives of antiquity are juſtified by the experience of modern times <note n="7" place="bottom">The fourth book of Herodotus affords a curious, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, portrait of the Scythians. Among the moderns, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the uniform ſcene, the Khan of Khowareſm, Abulghazi Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadur, expreſſes his native feelings; and his Genealogical Hiſtory of the <hi>Tatars</hi> has been copiouſly illuſtrated by the French and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh editors.

To theſe guides I have added Gerbillon, and the other jeſuits (De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription de la Chine, par du Halde, tom. iv.), who accurately ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the Chineſe Tartary; and that honeſt and intelligent traveller Bell, of Antermony (two volumes in 4to.

Some of the happy ſavages, who dwell between the tropics, are plentifully nouriſhed by the liberality of nature; but in the climates of the North, a nation of ſhepherds is reduced to their flocks and herds. The ſkilful practitioners of the medical art will determine (if they are able to determine) how far the temper of the human mind may be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the uſe of animal, or of vegetable, food; and whether the common aſſociation of carnivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and cruel, deſerves to be conſidered in any
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0034700104:351"/>
other light than that of an innocent, perhaps a ſalutary, prejudice of humanity <note n="9" place="bottom">Il eſt certain que les grands mangeurs de viande ſont en general cruels et feroces plus que les autres hommes. Cette obſervation eſt de touts les lieux, et de touts les tems: la barbare Angloiſe eſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, &amp;c. Emile de Rouſſeau, tom. i. p. 274. Whatever we may think of the general obſervation, <hi>we</hi> ſhall not eaſily allow the truth of his example. The good-natured complaints of Plutarch, and the pathetic lamentations of Ovid, ſeduce our reaſon, by exciting our ſenſibility.</note>. Yet if it be true, that the ſentiment of compaſſion is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly weakened by the ſight and practice of domeſtic cruelty, we may obſerve, that the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid objects which are diſguiſed by the arts of European refinement, are exhibited in their naked and moſt diſguſting ſimplicity, in the tent of a Tartarian ſhepherd. The ox, or the ſheep, are ſlaughtered by the ſame hand from which they were accuſtomed to receive their daily food; and the bleeding limbs are ſerved, with very little preparation, on the table of their unfeeling mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. In the military profeſſion, and eſpecially in the conduct of a numerous army, the excluſive uſe of animal food appears to be productive of the moſt ſolid advantages. Corn is a bulky and periſhable commodity; and the large magazines, which are indiſpenſably neceſſary for the ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our troops, muſt be ſlowly tranſported by the labour of men, or horſes. But the flocks and herds, which accompany the march of the Tartars, afford a ſure and encreaſing ſupply of fleſh and milk: in the far greater part of the uncultivated waſte, the vegetation of the graſs is quick and luxuriant; and there are few places
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0034700104:352"/>
ſo extremely barren, that the hardy cattle of the North cannot find ſome tolerable paſture. The ſupply is multiplied and prolonged, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhing appetite, and patient abſtinence, of the Tartars. They indifferently feed on the fleſh of thoſe animals that have been killed for the table, or have died of diſeaſe. Horſe-fleſh, which in every age and country has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the civiliſed nations of Europe and Aſia, they devour with peculiar greedineſs; and this ſingular taſte facilitates the ſucceſs of their military operations. The active cavalry of Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia is always followed, in their moſt diſtant and rapid incurſions, by an adequate number of ſpare horſes, who may be occaſionally uſed, either to redouble the ſpeed, or to ſatisfy the hunger, of the Barbarians. Many are the reſources of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and poverty. When the forage round a camp of Tartars is almoſt conſumed, they ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the greateſt part of their cattle, and preſerve the fleſh, either ſmoked, or dried in the ſun. On the ſudden emergency of a haſty march, they provide themſelves with a ſufficient quantity of little balls of cheeſe, or rather of hard curd, which they occaſionally diſſolve in water; and this unſubſtantial diet will ſupport, for many days, the life, and even the ſpirits, of the patient warrior. But this extraordinary abſtinence, which the Stoic would approve, and the hermit might envy, is commonly ſucceeded by the moſt voracious indulgence of appetite. The wines of a happier climate are the moſt grateful preſent,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0034700104:353"/>
or the moſt valuable commodity, that can be offered to the Tartars; and the only example of their induſtry ſeems to conſiſt in the art of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting from mare's milk a fermented liquor, which poſſeſſes a very ſtrong power of intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Like the animals of prey, the ſavages, both of the old and new world, experience the alternate viciſſitudes of famine and plenty; and their ſtomach is inured to ſuſtain, without much inconvenience, the oppoſite extremes of hunger and of intemperance.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In the ages of ruſtic and martial ſimplicity, <note place="margin">Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> a people of ſoldiers and huſbandmen are diſperſed over the face of an extenſive and cultivated country; and ſome time muſt elapſe before the warlike youth of Greece or Italy could be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under the ſame ſtandard, either to defend their own confines, or to invade the territories of the adjacent tribes. The progreſs of manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and commerce inſenſibly collects a large multitude within the walls of a city: but theſe citizens are no longer ſoldiers; and the arts which adorn and improve the ſtate of civil ſociety, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the habits of the military life. The paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral manners of the Scythians ſeem to unite the different advantages of ſimplicity and refinement. The individuals of the ſame tribe are conſtantly aſſembled, but they are aſſembled in a camp; and the native ſpirit of theſe dauntleſs ſhepherds is animated by mutual ſupport and emulation. The houſes of the Tartars are no more than ſmall tents, of an oval form, which afford a cold and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0034700104:354"/>
dirty habitation, for the promiſcuous youth of both ſexes. The palaces of the rich conſiſt of wooden huts, of ſuch a ſize that they may be conveniently fixed on large waggons, and drawn by a team perhaps of twenty or thirty oxen. The flocks and herds, after grazing all day in the adjacent paſtures, retire, on the approach of night, within the protection of the camp. The neceſſity of preventing the moſt miſchievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, in ſuch a perpetual concourſe of men and animals, muſt gradually introduce, in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, the order, and the guard, of the encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the rudiments of the military art. As ſoon as the forage of a certain diſtrict is conſumed, the tribe, or rather army, of ſhepherds, makes a regular march to ſome freſh paſtures; and thus acquires, in the ordinary occupations of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral liſe, the practical knowledge of one of the moſt important and difficult operations of war. The choice of ſtations is regulated by the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſeaſons: in the ſummer, the Tartars advance towards the North, and pitch their tents on the banks of a river, or, at leaſt, in the neighbourhood of a running ſtream. But in the winter they return to the South, and ſhelter their camp, behind ſome convenient eminence, againſt the winds, which are chilled in their paſſage over the bleak and icy regions of Siberia. Theſe manners are admirably adapted to diffuſe, among the wandering tribes, the ſpirit of emigration and conqueſt. The connection between the people and their territory is of ſo frail a texture, that it
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0034700104:355"/>
may be broken by the ſlighteſt accident. The camp, and not the ſoil, is the native country of the genuine Tartar. Within the precincts of that camp, his family, his companions, his property are always included; and, in the moſt diſtant marches, he is ſtill ſurrounded by the objects which are dear, or valuable, or familiar in his eyes. The thirſt of rapine, the fear, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of injury, the impatience of ſervitude, have, in every age, been ſufficient cauſes to urge the tribes of Scythia boldly to advance into ſome unknown countries, where they might hope to find a more plentiful ſubſiſtence, or a leſs form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idable enemy. The revolutions of the North have frequently determined the fate of the South; and in the conflict of hoſtile nations, the victor and the vanquiſhed have alternately drove, and been driven, from the confines of China to thoſe of Germany <note n="10" place="bottom">Theſe Tartar emigrations have been diſcovered by M. de Guignes (Hiſtoire des Huns, tom. i. ii.), a ſkilful and laborious interpreter of the Chineſe language; who has thus laid open new and important ſcenes in the hiſtory of mankind.</note>. Theſe great emigrations, which have been ſometimes executed with almoſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible diligence, were rendered more eaſy by the peculiar nature of the climate. It is well known, that the cold of Tartary is much more ſevere than in the midſt of the temperate zone might reaſonably be expected: this uncommon rigour is attributed to the height of the plains, which riſe, eſpecially towards the Eaſt, more than half a mile above the level of the ſea; and to the quantity of ſaltpetre, with which the ſoil is deeply
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0034700104:356"/>
impregnated <note n="11" place="bottom">A plain in the Chineſe Tartary, only eighty leagues from the great wall, was found by the miſſionaries to be three thouſand geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical paces above the level of the ſea. Monteſquieu, who has uſed, and abuſed, the relations of travellers, deduces the revolutions of Aſia from this important circumſtance, that heat and cold, weakneſs and ſtrength, touch each other without any temperate zone (Eſprit des Loix, l. xvii. c. 3.).</note>. In the winter-ſeaſon, the broad and rapid rivers, that diſcharge their waters into the Euxine, the Caſpian, or the Icy Sea, are ſtrongly frozen; the fields are covered with a bed of ſnow; and the fugitive, or victorious, tribes may ſecurely traverſe, with their families, their waggons, and their cattle, the ſmooth and hard ſurface of an immenſe plain.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The paſtoral life, compared with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <note place="margin">Exerciſes.</note> of agriculture and manufactures, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a life of idleneſs; and as the moſt honourable ſhepherds of the Tartar race devolve on their captives the domeſtic management of the cattle, their own leiſure is ſeldom diſturbed by any ſervile and aſſiduous cares. But this leiſure, inſtead of being devoted to the ſoft enjoyments of love and harmony, is uſefully ſpent in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſanguinary exerciſe of the chace. The plains of Tartary are filled with a ſtrong and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable breed of horſes, which are eaſily trained for the purpoſes of war and hunting. The Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians of every age have been celebrated as bold and ſkilful riders: and conſtant practice had ſeated them ſo firmly on horſeback, that they were ſuppoſed by ſtrangers to perform the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary duties of civil life, to eat, to drink, and even to ſleep, without diſmounting from their
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0034700104:357"/>
ſteeds. They excel in the dexterous management of the lance; the long Tartar bow is drawn with a nervous arm; and the weighty arrow is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to its object with unerring aim, and irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible force. Theſe arrows are often pointed againſt the harmleſs animals of the deſert, which increaſe and multiply in the abſence of their moſt formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enemy; the hare, the goat, the roebuck, the fallow-deer, the ſtag, the elk, and the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope. The vigour and patience both of the men and horſes are continually exerciſed by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of the chace; and the plentiful ſupply of game contributes to the ſubſiſtence, and even luxury, of a Tartar camp. But the exploits of the hunters of Scythia are not confined to the deſtruction of timid or innoxious beaſts; they boldly encounter the angry wild-boar, when he turns againſt his purſuers, excite the ſluggiſh courage of the bear, and provoke the fury of the tyger, as he ſlumbers in the thicket. Where there is danger there may be glory: and the mode of hunting, which opens the faireſt field to the exertions of valour, may juſtly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the image, and as the ſchool, of war. The general hunting-matches, the pride and delight of the Tartar princes, compoſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive exerciſe for their numerous cavalry. A circle is drawn, of many miles in circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to encompaſs the game of an extenſive diſtrict; and the troops that form the circle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly advance towards a common centre; where the captive animals, ſurrounded on every
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0034700104:358"/>
ſide, are abandoned to the darts of the hunters. In this march, which frequently continues many days, the cavalry are obliged to climb the hills, to ſwim the rivers, and to wind through the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, without interrupting the preſcribed order of their gradual progreſs. They acquire the habit of directing their eye, and their ſteps, to a remote object; of preſerving their intervals; of ſuſpending, or accelerating, their pace, according to the motions of the troops on their right and left; and of watching and repeating the ſignals of their leaders. Their leaders ſtudy, in this practical ſchool, the moſt important leſſon of the military art; the prompt and accurate judgment of ground, of diſtance, and of time. To employ againſt a human enemy the ſame patience and valour, the ſame ſkill and diſcipline, is the only alteration which is required in real war; and the amuſements of the chace ſerve as a prelude to the conqueſt of an empire <note n="12" place="bottom">Petit de la Croix (Vie de Gengiſcan, l. iii. c. 7.) repreſents the full glory and extent of the Mogul chace.

            <p>The political ſociety of the ancient Germans <note place="margin">Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> has the appearance of a voluntary alliance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent warriors. The tribes of Scythia, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the modern appellation of <hi>Hords,</hi> aſſume the form of a numerous and increaſing family; which, in the courſe of ſucceſſive gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0034700104:359"/>
has been propagated from the ſame ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſtock. The meaneſt, and moſt ignorant, of the Tartars, preſerve, with conſcious pride, the ineſtimable treaſure of their genealogy; and whatever diſtinctions of rank may have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, by the unequal diſtribution of paſtoral wealth, they mutually reſpect themſelves, and each other, as the deſcendants of the firſt founder of the tribe. The cuſtom, which ſtill prevails, of adopting the braveſt, and moſt faithful, of the captives, may countenance the very probable ſuſpicion, that this extenſive conſanguinity is, in a great meaſure, legal and fictitious. But the uſeful prejudice, which has obtained the ſanction of time and opinion, produces the effects of truth; the haughty Barbarians yield a cheerful and voluntary obedience to the head of their blood; and their chief, or <hi>murſa,</hi> as the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of their great father, exerciſes the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a judge, in peace, and of a leader, in war. In the original ſtate of the paſtoral world, each of the <hi>murſas</hi> (if we may continue to uſe a modern appellation) acted as the independent chief of a large and ſeparate family; and the limits of their peculiar territories were gradually fixed, by ſuperior force, or mutual conſent. But the conſtant operation of various and permanent cauſes contributed to unite the vagrant Hords into national communities, under the command of a ſupreme head. The weak were deſirous of ſupport, and the ſtrong were ambitious of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; the power, which is the reſult of union, oppreſſed and collected the divided forces of the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0034700104:360"/>
adjacent tribes; and, as the vanquiſhed were freely admitted to ſhare the advantages of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the moſt valiant chiefs haſtened to range themſelves, and their followers, under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable ſtandard of a confederate nation. The moſt ſucceſsful of the Tartar princes aſſumed the military command, to which he was entitled by the ſuperiority, either of merit, or of power. He was raiſed to the throne by the acclamations of his equals; and the title of <hi>Khan</hi> expreſſes, in the language of the North of Aſia, the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the regal dignity. The right of heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſucceſſion was long confined to the blood of the founder of the monarchy; and at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all the Khans, who reign from Crimea to the wall of China, are the lineal deſcendants of the renowned Zingis <note n="13" place="bottom">See the ſecond volume of the Genealogical Hiſtory of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars: and the liſts of the Khans, at the end of the life of Gengis, or Zingis.

But, as it is the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable duty of a Tartar ſovereign to lead his warlike ſubjects into the field, the claims of an infant ar often diſregarded; and ſome royal kinſman, diſtinguiſhed by his age and valour, is entruſted with the ſword and ſceptre of his predeceſſor. Two diſtinct and regular taxes are levied on the tribes, to ſupport the dignity of their national monarch, and of their peculiar chief; and each of thoſe contributions amounts to the tythe, both of their property, and of their
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0034700104:361"/>
ſpoil. A Tartar ſovereign enjoys the tenth part of the wealth of his people; and as his own domeſtic riches of flocks and herds increaſe in a much larger proportion, he is able plentifully to maintain the ruſtic ſplendor of his court, to reward the moſt deſerving, or the moſt favoured, of his followers, and to obtain, from the gentle influence of corruption, the obedience which might be ſometimes refuſed to the ſtern man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates of authority. The manners of his ſubjects, accuſtomed, like himſelf, to blood and rapine, might excuſe, in their eyes, ſuch partial acts of tyranny, as would excite the horror of a civiliſed people; but the power of a deſpot has never been acknowledged in the deſerts of Scythia. The immediate juriſdiction of the Khan is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the limits of his own tribe; and the exerciſe of his royal prerogative has been mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the ancient inſtitution of a national council.

improved the ſuperiority which they deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the temper of their arms, their chariots of war, and the ſervice of their Tartar auxiliaries. The camp of the Tanjou was ſurpriſed in the midſt of ſleep and intemperance: and, though the monarch of the Huns bravely cut his way through the ranks of the enemy, he left above fifteen thouſand of his ſubjects on the field of battle. Yet this ſignal victory, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded and followed by many bloody engagements, contributed much leſs to the deſtruction of the power of the Huns, than the effectual policy which was employed to detach the tributary nations from their obedience.

While ſome acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged themſelves the allies or vaſſals of the empire, they all became the implacable enemies of the Huns: and the numbers of that haughty people, as ſoon as they were reduced to their native ſtrength, might, perhaps, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the walls of one of the great and populous cities of China <note n="39" place="bottom">This expreſſion is uſed in the memorial to the emperor Venti (Duhalde, tom. ii. p. 417.).

A magnificent palace was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for his reception; his place was aſſigned above all the princes of the royal family; and the patience of the Barbarian king was exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ceremonies of a banquet, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of eight courſes of meat, and of nine ſolemn pieces of muſic. But he performed, on his knees, the duty of a reſpectful homage to the emperor of China; pronounced, in his own name, and in the name of his ſucceſſors, a perpetual oath of fidelity; and gratefully accepted a ſeal, which was beſtowed as the emblem of his regal depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. After this humiliating ſubmiſſion, the Tanjous ſometimes departed from their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ſeized the favourable moments of war and rapine; but the monarchy of the Huns gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually declined, till it was broken, by civil diſſention, into two hoſtile and ſeparate king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.

But the moſt warlike and powerful tribes of the Huns maintained, in their adverſe fortune, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted ſpirit of their anceſtors.

Neceſſity compelled them to exchange the ſilks of China, for the furs of Siberia; the imperfect rudiments of civiliſed life were obliterated; and the native fierceneſs of the Huns was exaſperated by their intercourſe with the ſavage tribes, who were compared, with ſome propriety, to the wild beaſts of the deſert. Their independent ſpirit ſoon rejected the hereditary ſucceſſion of the Tanjous; and while each hord was governed by its peculiar Murſa, their tumultuary council di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the public meaſures of the whole nation.

In the winter, they deſcended with their flocks and herds towards the mouth of that mighty river; and their ſummer excurſions reached as high as the latitude of Saratoff, or perhaps the conflux of the Kama.

There is ſome reaſon, however, to apprehend, that the ſame force which had driven them from their native ſeats, ſtill continued to impel their march towards the frontiers of Europe. The power of the Sienpi, their implacable enemies, which extended above three thouſand miles from Eaſt to Weſt <note n="52" place="bottom">The Kang-Mou (tom. iii. p. 447.) aſcribes to their conqueſts a ſpace of 14,000 <hi>lis.</hi> According to the preſent ſtandard, 200 <hi>lis</hi> (or more accurately 193) are equal to one degree of latitude; and one Engliſh mile conſequently exceeds three miles of China.

The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent hiſtory (p. 145—277) of three or four Hunnic dynaſties evidently proves, that their martial ſpirit was not impaired by a long reſidence in China.</note>. The Huns, with their flocks and herds, their wives and children, their dependents and allies, were tranſported to the Weſt of the Volga: and they boldly advanced to invade the country of the Alani, a paſtoral peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who occupied, or waſted, an extenſive tract of the deſerts of Scythia. The plains between the Volga and the Tanais were covered with the tents of the Alani, but their name and manners were diffuſed over the wide extent of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts; and the painted tribes of the Agathyrſi and Geloni were confounded among their vaſſals. Towards the North, they penetrated into the frozen regions of Siberia, among the ſavages who were accuſtomed, in their rage or hunger, to the taſte of human fleſh: and their Southern inroads were puſhed as far as the confines of Perſia and India. The mixture of Sarmatic and
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0034700104:380"/>
German blood had contributed to improve the features of the Alani, to whiten their ſwarthy complexions, and to tinge their hair with a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh caſt, which is ſeldom found in the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar race. They were leſs deformed in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, leſs brutiſh in their manners, than the Huns; but they did not yield to thoſe formidable Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians in their martial and independent ſpirit; in the love of freedom, which rejected even the uſe of domeſtic ſlaves; and in the love of arms, which conſidered war and rapine as the pleaſure and the glory of mankind. A naked ſcymetar, fixed in the ground, was the only object of their religious worſhip; the ſcalps of their enemies formed the coſtly trappings of their horſes; and they viewed, with pity and contempt, the puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimous warriors, who patiently expected the infirmities of age, and the tortures of lingering diſeaſe <note n="54" place="bottom">Utque hominibus quietis et placidis otium eſt voluptabile, ita illos pericula juvant et bella.

The brothers of that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate woman ſeized the favourable moment of revenge. The aged king of the Goths languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome time after the dangerous wound which he received from their daggers: but the conduct of the war was retarded by his infirmities; and the public councils of the nation were diſtracted by a ſpirit of jealouſy and diſcord. His death, which has been imputed to his own deſpair, left the reins of government in the hands of Withi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who, with the doubtful aid of ſome Scythian mercenaries, maintained the unequal conteſt againſt the arms of the Huns and the Alani, till he was defeated and ſlain, in a deciſive battle. The Oſtrogoths ſubmitted to their fate: and the royal race of the Amali will hereafter be found among the ſubjects of the haughty Attila.

the diligence of Alatheus and Saphrax; two war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors of approved valour and fidelity; who, by cautious marches, conducted the independent remains of the nation of the Oſtrogoths towards the Danaſtus, or Nieſter; a conſiderable river, which now ſeparates the Turkiſh dominions from the empire of Ruſſia. On the banks of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſter, the prudent Athanaric, more attentive to his own than to the general ſafety, had fixed the camp of the Viſigoths; with the firm reſolution of oppoſing the victorious Barbarians, whom he thought it leſs adviſable to provoke. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſpeed of the Huns was checked by the weight of baggage, and the incumbrance of captives; but their military ſkill deceived, and almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, the army of Athanaric. While the judge of the Viſigoths defended the banks of the Nieſter, he was encompaſſed and attacked by a numerous detachment of cavalry, who, by the light of the moon, had paſſed the river in a fordable place; and, it was not without the utmoſt efforts of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and conduct, that he was able to effect his retreat towards the hilly country. The undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed general had already formed a new and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious plan of defenſive war; and the ſtrong lines, which he was preparing to conſtruct between the mountains, the Pruth and the Danube, would have ſecured the extenſive and fertile territory that bears the modern name of Walachia, from the deſtructive inroads of the Huns <note n="60" place="bottom">The text of Ammianus ſeems to be imperfect, or corrupt; but the nature of the ground explains, and almoſt defines, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic rampart.

But the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the emperor was moſt ſeriouſly engaged, by the important intelligence which he received from the civil and military officers who were entruſted with the defence of the Danube. He was informed, that the North was agitated by a furious tempeſt; that the irruption of the Huns, an unknown and monſtrous race of ſavages, had ſubverted the power of the Goths; and that the ſuppliant multitudes of that warlike nation, whoſe pride was now humbled in the duſt, covered a ſpace of many miles along the banks of the river. With out-ſtretched arms, and pathetic lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, they loudly deplored their paſt misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and their preſent danger; acknowledged, that their only hope of ſafety was in the clemency of the Roman government; and moſt ſolemnly proteſted, that if the gracious liberality of the emperor would permit them to cultivate the waſte lands of Thrace, they ſhould ever hold themſelves bound, by the ſtrongeſt obligations of duty and gratitude, to obey the laws, and to guard the limits, of the republic. Theſe aſſurances were confirmed by the ambaſſadors of the Goths, who impatiently expected, from the mouth of Valens, an anſwer that muſt finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen. The emperor of the Eaſt was no longer guided by the wiſdom and authority of his elder brother, whoſe death hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened <note place="margin">A. D. 375.

and as the diſtreſsful ſituation of the Goths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an inſtant and peremptory deciſion, he was deprived of the favourite reſource of feeble and timid minds; who conſider the uſe of dilatory and ambiguous meaſures as the moſt admirable efforts of conſummate prudence. As long as the ſame paſſions and intereſts ſubſiſt among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the queſtions of war and peace, of juſtice and policy, which were debated in the councils of antiquity, will frequently preſent themſelves as the ſubject of modern deliberation. But the moſt experienced ſtateſman of Europe, has never been ſummoned to conſider the propriety, or the danger, of admitting, or rejecting, an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable multitude of Barbarians, who are driven by deſpair and hunger to ſolicit a ſettlement on the territories of a civiliſed nation. When that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant propoſition, ſo eſſentially connected with the public ſafety, was referred to the miniſters of Valens, they were perplexed and divided; but they ſoon acquieſced in the flattering ſentiment which ſeemed the moſt favourable to the pride, the indolence, and the avarice of their ſovereign. The ſlaves, who were decorated with the titles of praefects and generals, diſſembled or diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the terrors of this national emigration; ſo extremely different from the partial and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental colonies, which had been received on the extreme limits of the empire. But they applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the liberality of fortune, which had conducted, from the moſt diſtant countries of the globe, a numerous and invincible army of ſtrangers, to defend the throne of Valens; who might now add
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0034700104:388"/>
to the royal treaſures, the immenſe ſums of gold ſupplied by the provincials to compenſate their annual proportion of recruits. The prayers of the Goths were granted, and their ſervice was accepted by the Imperial court: and orders were immediately diſpatched to the civil and military governors of the Thracian dioceſe, to make the neceſſary preparations for the paſſage and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of a great people, till a proper and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient territory could be allotted for their future reſidence. The liberality of the emperor was accompanied, however, with two harſh and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous conditions, which prudence might juſtify on the ſide of the Romans; but which diſtreſs alone could extort from the indignant Goths. Before they paſſed the Danube, they were requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deliver their arms: and it was inſiſted, that their children ſhould be taken from them, and diſperſed through the provinces of Aſia; where they might be civiliſed by the arts of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſerve as hoſtages to ſecure the fidelity of their parents.</p>
            <p>During this ſuſpenſe of a doubtful and diſtant <note place="margin">They are tranſported over the Danube into the Roman empire.</note> negociation, the impatient Goths made ſome raſh attempts to paſs the Danube, without the permiſſion of the government, whoſe protection they had implored. Their motions were ſtrictly obſerved by the vigilance of the troops which were ſtationed along the river; and their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt detachments were defeated with conſiderable ſlaughter: yet ſuch were the timid councils of the reign of Valens, that the brave officers who
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0034700104:389"/>
had ſerved their country in the execution of their duty, were puniſhed by the loſs of their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and narrowly eſcaped the loſs of their heads. The Imperial mandate was at length received for tranſporting over the Danube the whole body of the Gothic nation <note n="65" place="bottom">The paſſage of the Danube is expoſed by Ammianus (xxxi. 3, 4.), Zoſimus (l. iv. p. 223, 224.), Eunapius in Excerpt.

It was thought expedient that an accurate account ſhould be taken of their numbers; but the perſons who were employed ſoon deſiſted, with amazement and diſmay, from the proſecution of the endleſs

A probable teſtimony has fixed the number of the Gothic warriors at two hundred thouſand men; and if we can venture to add the juſt proportion of women, of children, and of ſlaves, the whole maſs of people which compoſed this formidable emigration, muſt have amounted to near a million of perſons, of both ſexes, and of all ages. The children of the Goths, thoſe at leaſt of a diſtinguiſhed rank, were ſeparated from the multitude. They were conducted, without delay, to the diſtant ſeats aſſigned for their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and education; and as the numerous train of hoſtages or captives paſſed through the cities, their gay and ſplendid apparel, their robuſt and martial figure, excited the ſurpriſe and envy of the Provincials. But the ſtipulation, the moſt offenſive to the Goths, and the moſt important to the Romans, was ſhamefully eluded. The Barbarians, who conſidered their arms as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of honour, and the pledges of ſafety, were diſpoſed to offer a price, which the luſt or avarice of the Imperial officers was eaſily tempted to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0034700104:391"/>
accept. To preſerve their arms, the haughty warriors conſented, with ſome reluctance, to proſtitute their wives or their daughters; the charms of a beauteous maid, or a comely boy, ſecured the connivance of the inſpectors; who ſometimes caſt an eye of covetouſneſs on the fringed carpets and linen garments of their new allies <note n="68" place="bottom">Eunapius and Zoſimus curiouſly ſpecify theſe articles of Gothic wealth and luxury.

The Goths, with arms in their hands, were permitted to enter the boats; and, when their ſtrength was collected on the other ſide of the river, the immenſe camp which was ſpread over the plains and the hills of the Lower Maeſia, aſſumed a threatening and even hoſtile aſpect. The leaders of the Oſtrogoths, Alatheus and Saphrax, the guardians of their infant king, appeared ſoon afterwards on the Northern banks of the Danube; and immediately diſpatched their ambaſſadors to the court of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, to ſolicit, with the ſame profeſſions of allegiance and gratitude, the ſame favour which had been granted to the ſuppliant Viſigoths.

of near a million of extraordinary ſubjects could be ſupplied only by conſtant and ſkilful diligence, and might continually be interrupted by miſtake or accident. The inſolence, or the indignation, of the Goths, if they conceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the objects, either of fear, or of contempt, might urge them to the moſt deſperate extremities; and the fortune of the ſtate ſeemed to depend on the prudence, as well as the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, of the generals of Valens. At this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant criſis, the military government of Thrace was exerciſed by Lupicinus and Maximus, in whoſe venal minds the ſlighteſt hope of private emolument outweighed every conſideration of public advantage; and whoſe guilt was only alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated by their incapacity of diſcerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious effects of their raſh and criminal admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. Inſtead of obeying the orders of their ſovereign, and ſatisfying, with decent liberality, the demands of the Goths, they levied an unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and oppreſſive tax on the wants of the hungry Barbarians. The vileſt food was ſold at an extravagant price; and, in the room of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſubſtantial proviſions, the markets were filled with the fleſh of dogs, and of unclean ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, who had died of diſeaſe. To obtain the valuable acquiſition of a pound of bread, the Goths reſigned the poſſeſſion of an expenſive, though ſerviceable, ſlave; and a ſmall quantity of meat was greedily purchaſed with ten pounds of a precious, but uſeleſs, metal <note n="69" place="bottom">

The moſt lively reſentment is excited by the tyranny of pretended benefactors, who ſternly exact the debt of gratitude which they have cancelled by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent injuries: a ſpirit of diſcontent inſenſibly aroſe in the camp of the Barbarians, who plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without ſucceſs, the merit of their patient and dutiful behaviour; and loudly complained of the inhoſpitable treatment which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their new allies. They beheld around them the wealth and plenty of a fertile province, in the midſt of which they ſuffered the intolerable hardſhips of artificial famine. But the means of relief, and even of revenge, were in their hands; ſince the rapaciouſneſs of their tyrants had left, to an injured people, the poſſeſſion and the uſe of arms. The clamours of a multitude, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught to diſguiſe their ſentiments, announced the firſt ſymptoms of reſiſtance, and alarmed the timid and guilty minds of Lupicinus and Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus. Thoſe crafty miniſters, who ſubſtituted
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0034700104:394"/>
the cunning of temporary expedients to the wiſe and ſalutary counſels of general policy, attempted to remove the Goths from their dangerous ſtation on the frontiers of the empire; and to diſperſe them, in ſeparate quarters of cantonment, through the interior provinces. As they were conſcious how ill they had deſerved the reſpect, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, of the Barbarians, they diligently col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, from every ſide, a military force, that might urge the tardy and reluctant march of a people, who had not yet renounced the title, or the duties, of Roman ſubjects. But the generals of Valens, while their attention was ſolely direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the diſcontented Viſigoths, imprudently diſarmed the ſhips and the fortifications, which conſtituted the defence of the Danube. The fatal overſight was obſerved, and improved, by Alatheus and Saphrax, who anxiouſly watched the favourable moment of eſcaping from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the Huns. By the help of ſuch rafts and veſſels as could be haſtily procured, the leaders of the Oſtrogoths tranſported, without oppoſition, their king and their army; and boldly fixed an hoſtile and independent camp on the territories of the empire <note n="70" place="bottom">Ammianus, xxxi. 4, 5.</note>.</p>

In a ſeaſon of tranquillity, their power might have been equal, as well as their
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0034700104:395"/>
rank; but, as ſoon as their countrymen were exaſperated by hunger and oppreſſion, the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior abilities of Fritigern aſſumed the military command, which he was qualified to exerciſe for the public welfare. He reſtrained the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſpirit of the Viſigoths, till the injuries and the inſults of their tyrants ſhould juſtify their reſiſtance in the opinion of mankind: but he was not diſpoſed to ſacrifice any ſolid advantages for the empty praiſe of juſtice and moderation. Senſible of the benefits which would reſult from the union of the Gothic powers under the ſame ſtandard, he ſecretly cultivated the friendſhip of the Oſtrogoths; and while he profeſſed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit obedience to the orders of the Roman generals, he proceeded by ſlow marches towards Marcianopolis, the capital of the Lower Maeſia, about ſeventy miles from the banks of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube. On that fatal ſpot, the flames of diſcord and mutual hatred burſt forth into a dreadful conflagration. Lupicinus had invited the Gothic chiefs to a ſplendid entertainment; and their martial train remained under arms at the entrance of the palace. But the gates of the city were ſtrictly guarded; and the Barbarians were ſternly excluded from the uſe of a plentiful market, to which they aſſerted their equal claim of ſubjects and allies. Their humble prayers were rejected with inſolence and deriſion; and as their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience was now exhauſted, the townſmen, the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and the Goths, were ſoon involved in a conflict of paſſionate altercation and angry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0034700104:396"/>
A blow was imprudently given; a ſword was haſtily drawn; and the firſt blood that was ſpilt in this accidental quarrel, became the ſignal of a long and deſtructive war. In the midſt of noiſe and brutal intemperance, Lupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus was informed, by a ſecret meſſenger, that many of his ſoldiers were ſlain, and deſpoiled of their arms; and as he was already inflamed by wine, and oppreſſed by ſleep, he iſſued a raſh command, that their death ſhould be revenged by the maſſacre of the guards of Fritigern and Alavivus. The clamorous ſhouts and dying groans appriſed Fritigern of his extreme danger: and, as he poſſeſſed the calm and intrepid ſpirit of a hero, he ſaw that he was loſt if he allowed a moment of deliberation to the man who had ſo deeply injured him. <q>A trifling diſpute, ſaid the Gothic leader, with a firm but gentle tone of voice, appears to have ariſen between the two nations; but it may be productive of the moſt dangerous conſequences, unleſs the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult is immediately pacified by the aſſurance of our ſafety, and the authority of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</q> At theſe words, Fritigern and his companions drew their ſwords, opened their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through the unreſiſting crowd, which filled the palace, the ſtreets, and the gates, of Marcia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolis, and, mounting their horſes, haſtily vaniſhed from the eyes of the aſtoniſhed Romans. The generals of the Goths were ſaluted by the fierce and joyful acclamations of the camp: war was inſtantly reſolved, and the reſolution was
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0034700104:397"/>
executed without delay: the banners of the nation were diſplayed according to the cuſtom of their anceſtors; and the air reſounded with the harſh and mournful muſic of the Barbarian trumpet <note n="71" place="bottom">Vexillis de <hi>more</hi> ſublatis, auditiſque <hi>triſte ſonautibus claſſicis.</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian. xxxi. 5.

The weak and guilty Lupicinus, who had dared to provoke, who had neglected to deſtroy, and who ſtill preſumed to deſpiſe, his formidable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, marched againſt the Goths, at the head of ſuch a military force as could be collected on this ſudden emergency. The Barbarians expected his approach about nine miles from Marcianopolis; and on this occaſion the talents of the general were found to be of more prevailing efficacy than the weapons and diſcipline of the troops. The valour of the Goths was ſo ably directed by the genius of Fritigern, that they broke, by a cloſe and vigorous attack, the ranks of the Roman legions. Lupicinus left his arms and ſtandards, his tribunes and his braveſt ſoldiers, on the field of battle; and their uſeleſs courage ſerved only to protect the ignominious flight of their leader. <q>That ſucceſsful day put an end to the diſtreſs of the Barbarians, and the ſecurity of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: from that day, the Goths, renouncing the precarious condition of ſtrangers and exiles, aſſumed the character of citizens and maſters, claimed an abſolute dominion over the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of land, and held, in their own right, the northern provinces of the empire, which are bounded by the Danube.</q> Such are the

As they had been deprived, by the miniſters of the emperor, of the common benefits of nature, and the fair intercourſe of ſocial life, they retaliated the injuſtice on the ſubjects of the empire; and the crimes of Lupicinus were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated <note place="margin">They pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Thrace.</note> by the ruin of the peaceful huſbandmen of Thrace, the conflagration of their villages, and the maſſacre, or captivity, of their innocent fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. The report of the Gothic victory was ſoon diffuſed over the adjacent country; and while it filled the minds of the Romans with terror and diſmay, their own haſty imprudence contributed to increaſe the forces of Fritigern, and the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the province. Some time before the great emigration, a numerous body of Goths, under the command of Suerid and Colias, had been received into the protection and ſervice of

They were encamped under the walls of Hadrianople: but the miniſters of Valens were anxious to remove them beyond the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpont, at a diſtance from the dangerous tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which might ſo eaſily be communicated by the neighbourhood, and the ſucceſs, of their countrymen. The reſpectful ſubmiſſion with which they yielded to the order of their march, might be conſidered as a proof of their fidelity; and their moderate requeſt of a ſufficient allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of proviſions, and of a delay of only two days, was expreſſed in the moſt dutiful terms. But the firſt magiſtrate of Hadrianople, incenſed by ſome diſorders which had been committed at his country-houſe, refuſed this indulgence; and arming againſt them the inhabitants and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers of a populous city, he urged, with hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile threats, their inſtant departure. The Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians ſtood ſilent and amazed, till they were exaſperated by the inſulting clamours, and miſſile weapons, of the populace: but when patience or contempt was fatigued, they cruſhed the undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined multitude, inflicted many a ſhameful wound on the backs of their flying enemies, and deſpoiled them of the ſplendid armour <note n="74" place="bottom">An Imperial manufacture of ſhields, &amp;c. was eſtabliſhed at Hadrianople; and the populace were headed by the <hi>Fabricenſes,</hi> or workmen (Valeſ. ad Ammian. xxxi. 6.).</note>, which they were unworthy to bear.

Theſe healing and temperate meaſures ſeemed to concur with the timorous diſpoſition of the ſovereign of the Eaſt: but, on this occaſion alone, Valens was brave; and his unſeaſonable bravery was fatal to himſelf and to his ſubjects. He declared his intention of march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Antioch to Conſtantinople, to ſubdue this dangerous rebellion; and, as he was not

ignorant of the difficulties of the enterpriſe, he ſolicited the aſſiſtance of his nephew, the emperor Gratian, who commanded all the forces of the Weſt. The veteran troops were haſtily recalled from the defence of Armenia; that important frontier was abandoned to the diſcretion of Sapor; and the immediate conduct of the Gothic war was entruſted, during the abſence of Valens, to his lieutenants Trajan and Profuturus, two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals who indulged themſelves in a very falſe and favourable opinion of their own abilities. On their arrival in Thrace, they were joined by Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomer, count of the domeſtics; and the auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of the Weſt, that marched under his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, were compoſed of the Gallic legions, reduced indeed by a ſpirit of deſertion to the vain appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of ſtrength and numbers. In a council of war, which was influenced by pride, rather than by reaſon, it was reſolved to ſeek, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, the Barbarians; who lay encamped in the ſpacious and fertile meadows, near the moſt ſouthern of the ſix mouths of the Danube <note n="79" place="bottom">The Itinerary of Antoninus (p. 226, 227. edit.

In the midſt of riotous intemperance, the watchful Fritigern obſerved the motions, and penetrated the deſigns, of the Romans. He perceived, that the numbers of the enemy were continually increaſing; and, as he underſtood their intention of attacking his rear, as ſoon as the ſcarcity of forage ſhould oblige him to remove his camp; he recalled to their ſtandard his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory detachments, which covered the adjacent country.

The evening was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready far advanced; and the two armies prepared themſelves for the approaching combat, which was deferred only till the dawn of day. While the trumpets ſounded to arms, the undaunted courage of the Goths was confirmed by the mutual obligation of a ſolemn oath; and as they advanced to meet the enemy, the rude ſongs, which celebrated the glory of their forefathers, were mingled with their fierce and diſſonant out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries; and oppoſed to the artificial harmony of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0034700104:404"/>
the Roman ſhout. Some military ſkill was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played by Fritigern to gain the advantage of a commanding eminence; but the bloody conflict, which began and ended with the light, was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, on either ſide, by the perſonal and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate efforts of ſtrength, valour, and agility. The legions of Armenia ſupported their fame in arms; but they were oppreſſed by the irreſiſtible weight of the hoſtile multitude: the left wing of the Romans was thrown into diſorder, and the field was ſtrewed with their mangled carcaſſes. This partial defeat was balanced, however, by partial ſucceſs; and when the two armies, at a late hour of the evening, retreated to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective camps, neither of them could claim the honours, or the effects, of a deciſive victory. The real loſs was more ſeverely felt by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, in proportion to the ſmallneſs of their numbers; but the Goths were ſo deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and diſmayed by this vigorous, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps unexpected, reſiſtance, that they remained ſeven days within the circle of their fortifications. Such funeral rites, as the circumſtances of time and place would admit, were piouſly diſcharged to ſome officers of diſtinguiſhed rank; but the indiſcriminate vulgar was left unburied on the plain. Their fleſh was greedily devoured by the birds of prey, who, in that age, enjoyed very frequent and delicious feaſts; and ſeveral years afterwards the white and naked bones, which covered the wide extent of the fields, preſented

They prepared to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Viſigoths in the narrow angle of land, between the Danube, the deſert of Scythia, and the mountains of Haemus, till their ſtrength and ſpirit ſhould be inſenſibly waſted by the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table operation of famine. The deſign was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with ſome conduct and ſucceſs; the Barbarians had almoſt exhauſted their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines, and the harveſts of the country; and the diligence of Saturninus, the maſter-general of the cavalry, was employed to improve the ſtrength, and to contract the extent, of the Roman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications. His labours were interrupted by the alarming intelligence, that new ſwarms of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians had paſſed the unguarded Danube, either to ſupport the cauſe, or to imitate the example, of Fritigern. The juſt apprehenſion, that he himſelf might be ſurrounded, and overwhelmed, by the arms of hoſtile and unknown nations,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0034700104:406"/>
compelled Saturninus to relinquiſh the ſiege of the Gothic camp: and the indignant Viſigoths, breaking from their confinement, ſatiated their hunger and revenge, by the repeated devaſtation of the fruitful country, which extends above three hundred miles from the banks of the Danube to the ſtreights of the Helleſpont <note n="83" place="bottom">Ammian. xxxi. 8.</note>. The ſagacious Fritigern had ſucceſsfully appealed to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as well as to the intereſt, of his Barbarian allies; and the love of rapine, and the hatred of Rome, ſeconded, or even prevented, the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his ambaſſadors. He cemented a ſtrict and uſeful alliance with the great body of his countrymen, who obeyed Alatheus and Saphrax as the guardians of their infant king: the long animoſity of rival tribes was ſuſpended by the ſenſe of their common intereſt; the independent part of the nation was aſſociated under one ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; and the chiefs of the Oſtrogoths appear to have yielded to the ſuperior genius of the general of the Viſigoths. He obtained the formidable aid of the Taifalae, whoſe military renown was diſgraced and polluted by the public infamy of their domeſtic manners. Every youth, on his entrance into the world, was united by the ties of honourable friendſhip, and brutal love, to ſome warrior of the tribe; nor could he hope to be releaſed from this unnatural connection, till he had approved his manhood, by ſlaying, in ſingle combat, a huge bear, or a wild boar of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt <note n="84" place="bottom">Hanc Taifalorum gentem turpem, et obſcenae vitae flagitiis ita accipimus merſam; ut apud eos nefandi concubitûs foedere copulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur mares puberes, aetatis viriditatem in eorum pollutis uſibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpturi.

But the moſt powerful auxiliaries of the Goths were drawn from the camp of thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who had expelled them from their native ſeats. The looſe ſubordination, and extenſive poſſeſſions, of the Huns and the Alani, delayed the conqueſts, and diſtracted the councils, of that victorious people. Several of the hords were allured by the liberal promiſes of Fritigern; and the rapid cavalry of Scythia, added weight and energy to the ſteady and ſtrenuous efforts of the Gothic infantry. The Sarmatians, who could never forgive the ſucceſſor of Valentinian, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and encreaſed the general confuſion; and a ſeaſonable irruption of the Alemanni, into the provinces of Gaul, engaged the attention, and diverted the forces, of the emperor of the Weſt <note n="85" place="bottom">Ammian. xxxi. 8, 9.

A ſoldier, of the life-guards of Gratian, was of the nation
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0034700104:408"/>
of the Alemanni, and of the tribe of the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tienſes, who dwelt beyond the lake of Conſtance. Some domeſtic buſineſs obliged him to requeſt a leave of abſence. In a ſhort viſit to his family and friends, he was expoſed to their curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries; and the vanity of the loquacious ſoldier tempted him to diſplay his intimate acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the ſecrets of the ſtate, and the deſigns of his maſter. The intelligence, that Gratian was preparing to lead the military force of Gaul, and of the Weſt, to the aſſiſtance of his uncle Valens, pointed out to the reſtleſs ſpirit of the Alemanni, the moment, and the mode, of a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſful invaſion. The enterpriſe of ſome light detachments, who, in the month of February, paſſed the Rhine upon the ice, was the prelude of a more important war. The boldeſt hopes of rapine, perhaps of conqueſt, outweighed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of timid prudence, or national faith. Every foreſt, and every village, poured forth a band of hardy adventurers; and the great army of the Alemanni, which, on their approach, was eſtimated at forty thouſand men by the fears of the people, was afterwards magnified to the number of ſeventy thouſand, by the vain and credulous flattery of the Imperial court. The legions, which had been ordered to march into Pannonia, were immediately recalled, or detained, for the defence of Gaul; the military command was divided between Nanienus and Mellobaudes; and the youthful emperor, though he reſpected the long experience and ſober wiſdom of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0034700104:409"/>
was much more inclined to admire, and to follow, the martial ardour of his colleague; who was allowed to unite the incompatible characters of count of the domeſtics, and of king of the Franks. His rival Priarius, king of the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni, was guided, or rather impelled; by the ſame headſtrong valour; and as their troops were animated by the ſpirit of their leaders, they met, they ſaw, they encountered, each other, near the town of Argentaria, or Colmar <note n="86" place="bottom">The field of battle, <hi>Argentaria,</hi> or <hi>Argentovaria,</hi> is accurately fixed by M. d'Anville (Notice de l'Ancienne Gaul, p. 96—99.) at twenty-three Gallic leagues, or thirty-four and a half Roman miles, to the ſouth of Straſburgh.

The glory of the day was juſtly aſcribed to the miſſile weapons, and well-prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed evolutions of the Roman ſoldiers: the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni, who long maintained their ground, were ſlaughtered with unrelenting fury: five thouſand only of the Barbarians eſcaped to the woods and mountains; and the glorious death of their king on the field of battle, ſaved him from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the people, who are always diſpoſed to accuſe the juſtice, or policy, of an unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful war. After this ſignal victory, which ſecured the peace of Gaul, and aſſerted the honour of the Roman arms, the emperor Gratian appeared to proceed without delay on his Eaſtern expedition; but as he approached the confines of the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni, he ſuddenly inclined to the left, ſurpriſed them by his unexpected paſſage of the Rhine, and boldly advanced into the heart of their country.
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0034700104:410"/>
The Barbarians oppoſed to his progreſs the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles of nature and of courage; and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to retreat, from one hill to another, till they were ſatisfied, by repeated trials, of the power and perſeverance of their enemies. Their ſubmiſſion was accepted, as a proof, not indeed of their ſincere repentance, but of their actual diſtreſs; and a ſelect number of their brave and robuſt youth was exacted from the faithleſs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the moſt ſubſtantial pledge of their future moderation. The ſubjects of the empire, who had ſo often experienced, that the Alemanni could neither be ſubdued by arms, nor reſtrained by treaties, might not promiſe themſelves any ſolid or laſting tranquillity: but they diſcovered, in the virtues of their young ſovereign, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a long and auſpicious reign. When the legions climbed the mountains, and ſcaled the fortifications, of the Barbarians, the valour of Gratian was diſtinguiſhed in the foremoſt ranks; and the gilt and variegated armour of his guards was pierced and ſhattered by the blows, which they had received in their conſtant attachment to the perſon of their ſovereign. At the age of nineteen, the ſon of Valentinian ſeemed to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the talents of peace and war; and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſucceſs againſt the Alemanni was interpreted as a ſure preſage of his Gothic triumphs <note n="87" place="bottom">The full and impartial narrative of Ammianus (xxxi. 10.) may derive ſome additional light from the Epitome of Victor, the Chronicle of Jerom, and the Hiſtory of Oroſius (l. vii. c. 33. p. 552. edit.

The ſplendid narratives, which the general tranſmitted of his own exploits, alarmed the Imperial court by the appearance of ſuperior merit; and though he cautiouſly inſiſted on the difficulties of the Gothic war, his valour was praiſed, his advice was rejected; and Valens, who liſtened with pride and pleaſure to the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſuggeſtions of the eunuchs of the palace, was impatient to ſeize the glory of an eaſy and

aſſured conqueſt. His army was ſtrengthened by a numerous reinforcement of veterans; and his march from Conſtantinople to Hadrianople was conducted with ſo much military ſkill, that he prevented the activity of the Barbarians, who deſigned to occupy the intermediate defiles, and to intercept either the troops themſelves, or their convoys of proviſions. The camp of Valens, which he pitched under the walls of Hadrianople, was fortified, according to the practice of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, with a ditch and rampart; and a moſt important council was ſummoned, to decide the fate of the emperor and of the empire. The party of reaſon and of delay was ſtrenuouſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Victor, who had corrected, by the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of experience, the native fierceneſs of the Sarmatian character; while Sebaſtian, with the flexible and obſequious eloquence of a courtier, repreſented every precaution, and every meaſure, that implied a doubt of immediate victory, as unworthy of the courage and majeſty of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible monarch. The ruin of Valens was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated by the deceitful arts of Fritigern, and the prudent admonitions of the emperor of the Weſt. The advantages of negociating in the midſt of war, were perfectly underſtood by the general of the Barbarians; and a Chriſtian eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic was diſpatched, as the holy miniſter of peace, to penetrate, and to perplex, the councils of the enemy. The misfortunes, as well as the provocations, of the Gothic nation, were forcibly and truly deſcribed by their ambaſſador; who
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0034700104:414"/>
proteſted, in the name of Fritigern, that he was ſtill diſpoſed to lay down his arms, or to employ them only in the defence of the empire; if he could ſecure, for his wandering countrymen, a tranquil ſettlement on the waſte lands of Thrace, and a ſufficient allowance of corn and cattle. But he added, in a whiſper of confidential friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that the exaſperated Barbarians were averſe to theſe reaſonable conditions; and, that Friti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern was doubtful whether he could accompliſh the concluſion of the treaty, unleſs he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſupported by the preſence, and terrors, of an Imperial army. About the ſame time, Count Richomer returned from the Weſt, to announce the defeat and ſubmiſſion of the Alemanni, to inform Valens, that his nephew advanced by rapid marches at the head of the veteran and victorious legions of Gaul; and to requeſt, in the name of Gratian, and of the republic, that every dangerous and deciſive meaſure might be ſuſpended, till the junction of the two emperors ſhould enſure the ſucceſs of the Gothic war. But the feeble ſovereign of the Eaſt was actuated only by the fatal illuſions of pride and jealouſy.

The event of the battle of Hadrianople, ſo fatal to Valens and to the empire, may be deſcribed in a few words: <note place="margin">The defeat of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</note> the Roman cavalry fled; the infantry was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, ſurrounded, and cut in pieces. The moſt ſkilful evolutions, the firmeſt courage, are ſcarcely ſufficient to extricate a body of foot, encompaſſed, on an open plain, by ſuperior numbers of horſe: but the troops of Valens, oppreſſed by the weight of the enemy and their own fears, were crowded into a narrow ſpace, where it was impoſſible for them to extend their ranks, or even to uſe, with effect, their ſwords and javelins. In the midſt of tumult, of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of diſmay, the emperor, deſerted by his guards, and wounded, as it was ſuppoſed, with an arrow, ſought protection among the Lancearii and the Mattiarii, who ſtill maintained their
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0034700104:417"/>
ground with ſome appearance of order and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. His faithful generals, Trajan and Victor, who perceived his danger, loudly exclaimed, that all was loſt, unleſs the perſon of the emperor could be ſaved. Some troops, animated by their exhortation, advanced to his relief: they found only a bloody ſpot, covered with a heap of broken arms and mangled bodies, without being able to diſcover their unfortunate prince, either among the living, or the dead. Their ſearch could not indeed be ſucceſsful, if there is any truth in the circumſtances with which ſome hiſtorians have related the death of the emperor. By the care <note place="margin">Death of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Valens.</note> of his attendants, Valens was removed from the field of battle to a neighbouring cottage, where they attempted to dreſs his wound, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his future ſafety. But this humble retreat was inſtantly ſurrounded by the enemy: they tried to force the door; they were provoked by a diſcharge of arrows from the roof; till at length, impatient of delay, they ſet fire to a pile of dry faggots, and conſumed the cottage, with the Roman emperor and his train. Valens pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the flames; and a youth who dropt from the window, alone eſcaped, to atteſt the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly tale, and to inform the Goths of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable prize which they had loſt by their own raſhneſs. A great number of brave and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed officers periſhed in the battle of Hadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople, which equalled, in the actual loſs, and far ſurpaſſed, in the fatal conſequences, the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune which Rome had formerly ſuſtained in the

According to the grave Polybius, no more than 370 horſe, and 3000 foot, eſcaped from the field of Cannae: 10,000 were made priſoners; and the number of the ſlain amounted to 5630 horſe, and 70,000 foot (Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyb. l. iii. p. 371. edit.

Two maſter-generals of the cavalry and infantry, two great officers of the palace, and thirty-five tribunes, were found among the ſlain; and the death of Sebaſtian might ſatisfy the world, that he was the victim, as well as the author, of the public calamity.

            <p>While the impreſſions of grief and terror were <note place="margin">Funeral oration of Valens and his army.</note> ſtill recent in the minds of men, the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated rhetorician of the age compoſed the funeral oration of a vanquiſhed army, and of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popular prince, whoſe throne was already occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by a ſtranger. <q>There are not wanting, ſays the candid Libanius, thoſe who arraign

the prudence of the emperor, or who impute the public misfortune to the want of courage and diſcipline in the troops. For my own part, I reverence the memory of their former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits: I reverence the glorious death, which they bravely received, ſtanding, and fighting in their ranks: I reverence the field of battle, ſtained with <hi>their</hi> blood, and the blood of the Barbarians. Thoſe honourable marks have been already waſhed away by the rains; but the lofty monuments of their bones, the bones of generals, of centurions, and of valiant war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, claim a longer period of duration. The king himſelf fought and fell in the foremoſt ranks of the battle. His attendants preſented him with the fleeteſt horſes of the Imperial ſtable, that would ſoon have carried him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the purſuit of the enemy. They vainly preſſed him to reſerve his important life for the future ſervice of the republic. He ſtill declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he was unworthy to ſurvive ſo many of the braveſt and moſt faithful of his ſubjects; and the monarch was nobly buried under a mountain of the ſlain. Let none, therefore, preſume to aſcribe the victory of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians to the fear, the weakneſs, or the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of the Roman troops. The chiefs and the ſoldiers were animated by the virtue of their anceſtors, whom they equalled in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and the arts of war. Their generous emulation was ſupported by the love of glory, which prompted them to contend at the ſame
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0034700104:420"/>
time with heat and thirſt, with fire and the ſword; and cheerfully to embrace an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able death, as their refuge againſt flight and infamy. The indignation of the gods has been the only cauſe of the ſucceſs of our enemies.</q> The truth of hiſtory may diſclaim ſome parts of this panegyric, which cannot ſtrictly be reconciled with the character of Valens, or the circumſtances of the battle: but the faireſt commendation is due to the eloquence, and ſtill more to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, of the ſophiſt of Antioch <note n="95" place="bottom">Libanius de ulciſcend.

            <p>The pride of the Goths was elated by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable <note place="margin">The Goths beſiege Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianople.</note> victory; but their avarice was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the mortifying diſcovery, that the richeſt part of the Imperial ſpoil had been within the walls of Hadrianople. They haſtened to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the reward of their valour; but they were encountered by the remains of a vanquiſhed army, with an intrepid reſolution, which was the effect of their deſpair, and the only hope of their ſafety. The walls of the city, and the rainparts of the adjacent camp, were lined with military engines, that threw ſtones of an enormous weight; and aſtoniſhed the ignorant Barbarians by the noiſe, and velocity, ſtill more than by the real effects, of the diſcharge. The ſoldiers, the citizens, the provincials, the domeſtics of the palace, were united in the danger, and in the defence: the ſurious aſſault of the Goths was repulſed; their ſecret arts of treachery and treaſon were diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0034700104:421"/>
and, after an obſtinate conflict of many hours, they retired to their tents; convinced, by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that it would be far more adviſeable to obſerve the treaty, which their ſagacious leader had tacitly ſtipulated with the fortifications of great and populous cities. After the haſty and impolitic maſſacre of three hundred deſerters, an act of juſtice extremely uſeful to the diſcipline of the Roman armies, the Goths indignantly raiſed the ſiege of Hadrianople. The ſcene of war and tumult was inſtantly converted into a ſilent ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: the multitude ſuddenly diſappeared; the ſecret paths of the woods and mountains were marked with the footſteps of the trembling fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who ſought a refuge in the diſtant cities of Illyricum and Macedonia: and the faithful officers of the houſehold, and the treaſury, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly proceeded in ſearch of the emperor, of whoſe death they were ſtill ignorant. The tide of the Gothic inundation rolled from the walls of Hadrianople to the ſuburbs of Conſtantinople. The Barbarians were ſurpriſed with the ſplendid appearance of the capital of the Eaſt, the height and extent of the walls, the myriads of wealthy and affrighted citizens who crowded the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, and the various proſpect of the ſea and land. While they gazed with hopeleſs deſire on the inacceſſible beauties of Conſtantinople, a ſally was made from one of the gates by a party of Saracens <note n="96" place="bottom">Valens had gained, or rather purchaſed, the friendſhip of the Saracens, whoſe vexatious inroads were felt on the borders of Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia, Paleſtine, and Egypt.

The army of the Goths, laden with the ſpoils of the wealthy ſuburbs, and the adjacent territory, ſlowly moved, from the Boſphorus, to the mountains which form the weſtern boundary of Thrace.

            <p>Whatever may have been the juſt meaſure of <note place="margin">Maſſacre of the Gothic youth in Aſia, A.

The ſons of the Goths had been judiciouſly diſtributed through the cities of the Eaſt; and the arts of education were employed, to poliſh, and ſubdue, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fierceneſs of their temper. In the ſpace of about twelve years, their numbers had continually increaſed; and the children, who, in the firſt emigration, were ſent over the Helleſpont, had attained, with rapid growth, the ſtrength and ſpirit of perfect manhood <note n="102" place="bottom">Eunapius (in Excorpt.

Such was the Greek eloquence of the times.</note>. It was impoſſible to conceal from their knowledge the events of the Gothic war; and, as thoſe daring youths had not ſtudied the language of diſſimulation, they betrayed their wiſh, their deſire, perhaps their intention, to emulate the glorious example of their fathers. The danger of the times ſeemed to juſtify the jealous ſuſpicions of the provincials;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0034700104:426"/>
and theſe ſuſpicions were admitted as unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able evidence, that the Goths of Aſia had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſecret and dangerous conſpiracy againſt the public ſafety. The death of Valens had left the Eaſt without a ſovereign; and Julius, who filled the important ſtation of maſter-general of the troops, with a high reputation of diligence and ability, thought it his duty to conſult the ſenate of Conſtantinople; which he conſidered, during the vacancy of the throne, as the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative council of the nation. As ſoon as he had obtained the diſcretionary power of acting as he ſhould judge moſt expedient for the good of the republic, he aſſembled the principal officers; and privately concerted effectual meaſures for the execution of his bloody deſign. An order was immediately promulgated, that, on a ſtated day, the Gothic youth ſhould aſſemble in the capital cities of their reſpective provinces; and, as a report was induſtriouſly circulated, that they were ſummoned to receive a liberal gift of lands and money, the pleaſing hope allayed the fury of their reſentment, and perhaps ſuſpended the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the conſpiracy. On the appointed day, the unarmed crowd of the Gothic youth was carefully collected in the ſquare, or Forum: the ſtreets and avenues were occupied by the Roman troops; and the roofs of the houſes were covered with archers and ſlingers. At the ſame hour, in all the cities of the Eaſt, the ſignal was given of indiſcriminate ſlaughter; and the provinces of Aſia were delivered, by the cruel prudence of

            <p>The emperor Gratian was far advanced on his <note place="margin">The empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian inveſts Theodoſius with the empire of the Eaſt, A.

Whatever reſentment the raſh and jealous vanity of his uncle might deſerve, the reſentment of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mind is eaſily ſubdued by the ſofter emotions of grief and compaſſion: and even the ſenſe of pity was ſoon loſt in the ſerious and alarming conſideration of the ſtate of the republic. Gratian was too late to aſſiſt, he was too weak to revenge, his unfortunate colleague; and the valiant and modeſt youth felt himſelf unequal to the ſupport of a ſinking world. A formidable tempeſt of the Barbarians of Germany ſeemed ready to burſt
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0034700104:428"/>
over the provinces of Gaul; and the mind of Gratian was oppreſſed, and diſtracted, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Weſtern Empire. In this important criſis, the government of the Eaſt, and the conduct of the Gothic war, required the undivided attention of a hero and a ſtateſman. A ſubject inveſted with ſuch ample command would not long have preſerved his fidelity to a diſtant benefactor; and the Imperial council embraced the wiſe and manly reſolution, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring an obligation, rather than of yielding to an inſult. It was the wiſh of Gratian to beſtow the purple as the reward of virtue; but, at the age of nineteen, it is not eaſy for a prince, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the ſupreme rank, to underſtand the true characters of his miniſters and generals. He attempted to weigh, with an impartial hand, their various merits and defects; and, whilſt he checked the raſh confidence of ambition, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted the cautious wiſdom, which deſpaired of the republic. As each moment of delay dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſomething of the power and reſources of the future ſovereign of the Eaſt, the ſituation of the times would not allow a tedious debate. The choice of Gratian was ſoon declared in favour of an exile, whoſe father, only three years before, had ſuffered, under the ſanction of <hi>his</hi> authority, an unjuſt and ignominious death. The great Theodoſius, a name celebrated in hiſtory, and dear to the Catholic Church <note n="104" place="bottom">A life of Theodoſius the Great was compoſed in the laſt century (Paris 1679, in 4to; 1680, in 12mo), to inflame the mind of the young Dauphin with Catholic zeal. The author, Flechier, afterwards biſhop of Niſmes, was a celebrated preacher; and his hiſtory is adorned, or tainted, with pulpit-eloquence; but he takes his learning from Baronius, and his principles from St. Ambroſe and St. Auguſtin.</note>, was ſummoned

Five months after the death of Valens, the emperor Gratian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced before the aſſembled troops, <hi>his</hi> colleague, and <hi>their</hi> maſter; who, after a modeſt, perhaps a ſincere, reſiſtance, was compelled to accept, amidſt the general acclamations, the diadem, the purple, and the equal title of Auguſtus <note n="105" place="bottom">The birth, character, and elevation of Theodoſius, are marked in Pacatus (in Panegyr.

Even in thoſe governments which allow the reigning monarch to declare a colleague, or a ſucceſſor, his partial choice, which may be influenced by the blindeſt paſſions, is often directed to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy object.

of the reign of Theodoſius, we are reduced to illuſtrate the partial narrative of Zoſimus, by the obſcure hints of fragments and chronicles, by the figurative ſtyle of poetry or panegyric, and by the precarious aſſiſtance of the eccleſiaſtical wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who, in the heat of religious faction, are apt to deſpiſe the profane virtues of ſincerity and moderation. Conſcious of theſe diſadvantages, which will continue to involve a conſiderable portion of the decline and fall of the Roman empire, I ſhall proceed with doubtful and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſteps. Yet I may boldly pronounce, that the battle of Hadrianople was never revenged by any ſignal or deciſive victory of Theodoſius over the Barbarians; and the expreſſive ſilence of his venal orators may be confirmed by the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the condition and circumſtances of the times. The fabric of a mighty ſtate, which has been reared by the labours of ſucceſſive ages, could not be overturned by the misfortune of a ſingle day, if the fatal power of the imagination did not exaggerate the real meaſure of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. The loſs of forty thouſand Romans, who fell in the plains of Hadrianople, might have been ſoon recruited in the populous provinces of the Eaſt, which contained ſo many millions of inhabitants. The courage of a ſoldier is found to be the cheapeſt, and moſt common, quality of human nature; and ſufficient ſkill to encounter an undiſciplined foe, might have been ſpeedily taught by the care of the ſurviving centurions. If the Barbarians were mounted on the horſes,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0034700104:435"/>
and equipped with the armour, of their vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enemies, the numerous ſtuds of Cappadocia and Spain would have ſupplied new ſquadrons of cavalry; the thirty-four arſenals of the empire were plentifully ſtored with magazines of offenſive and defenſive arms; and the wealth of Aſia might ſtill have yielded an ample fund for the expences of the war. But the effects which were produced by the battle of Hadrianople on the minds of the Barbarians, and of the Romans, extended the victory of the former, and the defeat of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, far beyond the limits of a ſingle day. A Gothic chief was heard to declare, with inſolent moderation, that, for his own part, he was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued with ſlaughter; but that he was aſtoniſhed how a people, who fled before him like a flock of ſheep, could ſtill preſume to diſpute the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their treaſures and provinces <note n="115" place="bottom">Chryſoſtom, tom. i. p. 344. edit.

If Theodoſius, haſtily collecting his ſcattered forces, had led them into the field to encounter a victorious enemy, his army would have been vanquiſhed by their own fears; and his raſhneſs could not have been excuſed by the chance of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0034700104:436"/>
ſucceſs. But the <hi>great</hi> Theodoſius, an epithet which he honourably deſerved on this moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous occaſion, conducted himſelf as the firm and faithful guardian of the republic. He fixed his head-quarters at Theſſalonica, the capital of the Macedonian dioceſe <note n="117" place="bottom">See Godefroy's Chronology of the Laws. Codex Theodoſ. tom. i. Prolegomen. p. xcix—civ.</note>; from whence he could watch the irregular motions of the Barbarians, and direct the operations of his lieutenants, from the gates of Conſtantinople to the ſhores of the Hadriatic. The fortifications and garriſons of the cities were ſtrengthened; and the troops, among whom a ſenſe of order and diſcipline was revived, were inſenſibly emboldened by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of their own ſafety. From theſe ſecure ſtations, they were encouraged to make frequent ſallies on the Barbarians, who infeſted the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent country; and, as they were ſeldom allowed to engage, without ſome deciſive ſuperiority, either of ground or of numbers, their enterpriſes were, for the moſt part, ſucceſsful; and they were ſoon convinced, by their own experience, of the poſſibility of vanquiſhing their <hi>invincible</hi> enemies. The detachments of theſe ſeparate garriſons were gradually united into ſmall armies; the ſame cautious meaſures were purſued, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an extenſive and well-concerted plan of operations; the events of each day added ſtrength and ſpirit to the Roman arms; and the artful diligence of the emperor, who circulated the moſt favourable reports of the ſucceſs of the war,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0034700104:437"/>
contributed to ſubdue the pride of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and to animate the hopes and courage of his ſubjects. If, inſtead of this faint and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect outline, we could accurately repreſent the counſels and actions of Theodoſius, in four ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive campaigns, there is reaſon to believe, that his conſummate ſkill would deſerve the applauſe of every military reader. The republic had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been ſaved by the delays of Fabius: and, while the ſplendid trophies of Scipio, in the field of Zama, attract the eyes of poſterity, the camps and marches of the Dictator among the hills of Campania, may claim a juſter proportion of the ſolid and independent fame, which the general is not compelled to ſhare, either with fortune or with his troops. Such was likwiſe the merit of Theodoſius; and the infirmities of his body, which moſt unſeaſonably languiſhed under a long and dangerous diſeaſe, could not oppreſs the vigour of his mind, or divert his attention from the public ſervice <note n="118" place="bottom">Moſt writers inſiſt on the illneſs, and long repoſe, of Theodoſius, at Theſſalonica: Zoſimus, to diminiſh his glory; Jornandes, to favour the Goths; and the eccleſiaſtical writers, to introduce his baptiſm.</note>.</p>

As long as the ſuperior genius of Fritigern preſerved the union, and directed the motions, of the Barbarians, their power was not inadequate to the conqueſt of a great empire. The death of that hero, the predeceſſor and maſter of the renowned Alaric, relieved an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient multitude from the intolerable yoke of diſcipline and diſcretion. The Barbarians, who had been reſtrained by his authority, abandoned themſelves to the dictates of their paſſions; and their paſſions were ſeldom uniform, or conſiſtent. An army of conquerors was broken into many diſorderly bands of ſavage robbers; and their blind and irregular fury was not leſs pernicious to themſelves, than to their enemies. Their miſchievous diſpoſition was ſhewn in the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every object, which they wanted ſtrength to remove, or taſte to enjoy; and they often conſumed, with improvident rage, the harveſts, or the granaries, which ſoon afterwards became neceſſary for their own ſubſiſtence.

the inſults and injuries, which they had recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally offered, or ſuſtained, while the nation was ſeated in the countries beyond the Danube. The progreſs of domeſtic faction abated the more diffuſive ſentiment of national animoſity; and the officers of Theodoſius were inſtructed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, with liberal gifts and promiſes, the retreat, or ſervice, of the diſcontented party. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of Modar, a prince of the royal blood of the Amali, gave a bold and faithful champion to the cauſe of Rome. The illuſtrious deſerter ſoon obtained the rank of maſter-general, with an important command; ſurpriſed an army of his countrymen, who were immerſed in wine and ſleep; and, after a cruel ſlaughter of the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Goths, returned with an immenſe ſpoil, and four thouſand waggons, to the Imperial camp <note n="120" place="bottom">Zoſimus (l. iv. p. 232.) ſtyles him a Scythian, a name which the more recent Greeks ſeem to have appropriated to the Goths.</note>. In the hands of a ſkilful politician, the moſt different means may be ſucceſsfully applied to the ſame ends: and the peace of the empire, which had been forwarded by the diviſions, was accompliſhed by the re-union, of the Gothic nation. Athanaric, who had been a patient <note place="margin">Death and funeral of Athanaric, A. D. 381.

But age had chilled the daring ſpirit of Athanaric; and, inſtead of leading his people to the field of battle and victory, he wiſely liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the fair propoſal of an honourable and advantageous treaty. Theodoſius, who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the merit and power of his new ally, condeſcended to meet him at the diſtance of ſeveral miles from Conſtantinople; and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him in the Imperial city, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of a friend, and the magnificence of a monarch. <q>The Barbarian prince obſerved, with curious attention, the variety of objects which attracted his notice, and at laſt broke out into a ſincere and paſſionate exclamation of wonder.

But the progreſs of the Barbarians was ſuddenly ſtopped by an unexpected obſtacle; a triple line of veſſels, ſtrongly connected with each other, and which formed an impenetrable chain of two miles and a half along the river. While they ſtruggled to force their way in the unequal conflict, their right flank was overwhelmed by the irreſiſtible attack of a fleet of gallies, which
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0034700104:444"/>

He too frequently betrays his poverty of judgment, by diſgracing the moſt ſerious narratives with trifling and incredible circumſtances.</note>. The flattering poet, who celebrated, in the court of Honorius, the glory of the father and of the ſon, aſcribes the victory to the perſonal proweſs of Theodoſius; and almoſt inſinuates, that the king of the Oſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goths was ſlain by the hand of the emperor <note n="127" place="bottom">
                  <l>—Odothaei Regis <hi>opima</hi>
                  </l>

                  <p>Ver. 632. The <hi>opima</hi> were the ſpoils, which a Roman general could only win from the king, or general, of the enemy, whom he had ſlain with his own hands: and no more than three ſuch examples are celebrated in the victorious ages of Rome.</p>

The ſeries of their hiſtory has imperfectly preſerved the ſpirit and ſubſtance of this ſingular agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note n="128" place="bottom">
                  <p>See Themiſtius, Orat. xvi. p. 211. Claudian (in Eutrop. l. ii. 152.) mentions the Phrygian colony:</p>

               </note>. The ravages of war and tyranny had provided many large tracts of fertile, but uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated land, for the uſe of thoſe Barbarians, who might not diſdain the practice of agriculture. A numerous colony of the Viſigoths was ſeated in Thrace: the remains of the Oſtrogoths were planted in Phrygia and Lydia; their immediate wants were ſupplied by a diſtribution of corn and cattle; and their future induſtry was encouraged by an exemption from tribute, during a certain term of years. The Barbarians would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to feel the cruel and perfidious policy of the Imperial court, if they had ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be diſperſed through the provinces. They required, and they obtained, the ſole poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the villages and diſtricts aſſigned for their reſidence; they ſtill cheriſhed and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated their native manners and language; aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the boſom of deſpotiſm, the freedom of

their domeſtic government; and acknowledged the ſovereignty of the emperor, without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the inferior juriſdiction of the laws and magiſtrates of Rome. The hereditary chiefs of the tribes and families were ſtill permitted to command their followers in peace and war; but the royal dignity was aboliſhed; and the generals of the Goths were appointed and removed at the pleaſure of the emperor. An army of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Goths was maintained for the perpetual ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the empire of the Eaſt; and thoſe haughty troops, who aſſumed the title of <hi>Foederati,</hi> or allies, were diſtinguiſhed by their gold collars, liberal pay, and licentious privileges. Their native courage was improved by the uſe of arms, and the knowledge of diſcipline; and, while the republic was guarded, or threatened, by the doubtful ſword of the Barbarians, the laſt ſparks of the military flame were finally extinguiſhed in the minds of the Romans <note n="129" place="bottom">Compare Jornandes (c. xx. 27.), who marks the condition and number of the Gothic <hi>Foederati,</hi> with Zoſimus (l. iv. p. 258.), who mentions their golden collars; and Pacatus (in Panegyr.

Petav.). The philoſophic biſhop of Cyrene was near enough to judge; and he was ſufficiently removed from the temptation of fear, or flattery.</note>. The calamities of the war were painted in the moſt lively colours; and the firſt ſymptoms of the return of order, of plenty, and ſecurity, were diligently exaggerated. The advocates of Theodoſius could affirm, with ſome appearance of truth and reaſon, that it was impoſſible to extirpate ſo many warlike tribes, who were rendered deſperate by the loſs of their native country; and that the exhauſted provinces would be revived by a freſh ſupply of ſoldiers and huſbandmen. The Barbarians ſtill wore an angry and hoſtile aſpect; but the experience of paſt times might encourage the hope, that they would acquire the habits of induſtry and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; that their manners would be poliſhed by time, education, and the influence of Chriſtianity; and that their poſterity would inſenſibly blend with the great body of the Roman people <note n="132" place="bottom">Themiſtius (Orat. xvi. p. 211, 212.) compoſes an elaborate and rational apology, which is not, however, exempt from the pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilities of Greek rhetoric.

To the zeal and valour of the Barbarians, Theodoſius was indebted for the ſucceſs of his arms: but their aſſiſtance was precarious; and they were ſometimes ſeduced, by a treacherous and inconſtant diſpoſition, to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his ſtandard, at the moment when their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was the moſt eſſential. During the civil war againſt Maximus, a great number of Gothic deſerters retired into the moraſſes of Macedonia, waſted the adjacent provinces, and obliged the intrepid monarch to expoſe his perſon, and exert his power, to ſuppreſs the riſing flame of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion <note n="134" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. iv. p. 267—271.

The public apprehenſions were fortified by the ſtrong ſuſpicion, that theſe tumults were not the effect of accidental paſſion, but the reſult of deep and premeditated deſign. It was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believed, that the Goths had ſigned the treaty of peace with an hoſtile and inſidious ſpirit; and that their chiefs had previouſly bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by a ſolemn and ſecret oath, never to keep faith with the Romans; to maintain the faireſt ſhew of loyalty and friendſhip, and to watch the favourable moment of rapine, of conqueſt,

and of revenge. But, as the minds of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians were not inſenſible to the power of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſeveral of the Gothic leaders ſincerely devoted themſelves to the ſervice of the empire, or, at leaſt, of the emperor: the whole nation was inſenſibly divided into two oppoſite factions, and much ſophiſtry was employed in converſation and diſpute, to compare the obligations of their firſt, and ſecond, engagements. The Goths, who conſidered themſelves as the friends of peace, of juſtice, and of Rome, were directed by the authority of Fravitta, a valiant and honourable youth, diſtinguiſhed above the reſt of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, by the politeneſs of his manners, the liberality of his ſentiments, and the mild virtues of ſocial life. But the more numerous faction adhered to the fierce and faithleſs Priulf, who inflamed the paſſions, and aſſerted the independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of his warlike followers. On one of the ſolemn feſtivals, when the chiefs of both parties were invited to the Imperial table, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly heated by wine, till they forgot the uſual reſtraints of diſcretion and reſpect; and betrayed, in the preſence of Theodoſius, the fatal ſecret of their domeſtic diſputes. The emperor, who had been the reluctant witneſs of this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary controverſy, diſſembled his fears and reſentment, and ſoon diſmiſſed the tumultuous aſſembly. Fravitta, alarmed and exaſperated by the inſolence of his rival, whoſe departure from the palace might have been the ſignal of a civil war, boldly followed him; and, drawing his
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:0034700104:450"/>

Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions flew to arms; and the faithful champion of Rome would have been oppreſſed by ſuperior numbers, if he had not been protected by the ſeaſonable interpoſition of the Imperial guards <note n="135" place="bottom">Compare Eunapius (in Excerpt. Legat. p. 21, 22.) with Zoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus (l. iv. p. 279.). The difference of circumſtances and names muſt undoubtedly be applied to the ſame ſtory.

Such were the ſcenes of Barbaric rage, which diſgraced the palace and table of the Roman emperor; and, as the impatient Goths could only be reſtrained by the firm and temperate character of Theodoſius, the public ſafety ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depend on the life and abilities of a ſingle man <note n="136" place="bottom">Les Goths ravagerent tout depuis le Danube juſqu'au Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore; exterminerent Valens et ſon armée; et ne repaſſerent le Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube, que pour abandonner l'affreuſe ſolitude qu'ils avoient faite (Oeuvres de Monteſquieu, tom. iii. p. 479; Conſiderations ſur les <hi>Cauſes</hi> de la Grandeur et de la Decadence des Romains, c. xvii.).
