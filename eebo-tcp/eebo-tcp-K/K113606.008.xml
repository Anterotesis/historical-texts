            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of Caterpillars in General.</head>
               <p>IF we take a curſory view of inſects in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
caterpillars alone, and the butterflies and moths they give birth to, will make
a third part of the number. Wherever we move, wherever we turn, theſe
inſects, in one ſhape or another, preſent themſelves to our view. Some,
in every ſtate, offer the moſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpectacle; others are
beautiful only in their winged form. Many perſons, of which number I am one,
have an invincible averſion to caterpillars, and worms of every ſpecies:
there is ſomething diſagreeable in their ſlow crawling motion, for which
the variety of their colouring can never compenſate. But others feel no
repugnance at obſerving, and even handling them with the moſt attentive
application.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0824000108:6"/>There is nothing in the butterfly ſtate,
ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful or ſplendid as theſe inſects. They ſerve, not leſs
than the birds themſelves, to baniſh ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude from our walks, and to
fill up our idle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals with the moſt pleaſing ſpeculations. The
butterfly makes one of the principal ornaments of oriental poetry; but, in
thoſe countries, the inſect is larger and more beautiful than with us.</p>
               <p>The beauties of the fly may therefore very well excite our
curioſity to examine the reptile. But we are ſtill more ſtrongly attached
to this tribe, from the uſefulneſs of one of the number. The ſilkworm is,
perhaps, the moſt ſerviceable of all other animals; ſince, from its
labours, and the manufacture attending it, near a third part of the world are
cloathed, adorned, and ſupported.</p>
               <p>Caterpillars may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from worms or
maggots, by the number of their feet; and by their producing butterflies of
moths. When the ſun calls up vegetation, and vivifies the various eggs of
inſects, the caterpillars are the firſt that are ſeen, upon almoſt
every vegetable and tree, eating its leaves, and preparing for a ſtate of
greater perfection. They have feet both before and behind; which not only
enable them to move forward by a ſort of ſteps made by their fore and
hinder parts, but alſo to climb up ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, and to ſtretch themſelves
out from the boughs and ſtalks, to reach their food at a <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0824000108:7"/>
diſtance. All of this claſs have from eight feet at the leaſt, to
ſixteen; and this may ſerve to diſtinguiſh them from the worm tribe,
that never have ſo many. The animal into which they are converted, is always
a butterfly or a moth; and theſe are always diſtinguiſhed from other
flies, by having their wings covered over with a painted duſt, which gives
them ſuch various beauty. The wings of flies are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, as we ſee
in the common fleſh fly; while thoſe of beetles are hard, like horn: from
ſuch the wing of a butterfly may be eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; and words
would obſcure their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
               <p>From hence it appears, that caterpillars, whether in the reptile
ſtate, or advanced to their laſt ſtate of perfection into butterflies,
may eaſily be diſtinguiſhed from all other inſects; being animals
peculiarly formed, and alſo of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar nature. The tranſmutations they
undergo, are alſo more numerous than thoſe of any inſect hitherto
mentioned; and, in conſequence, they have been placed in the third order of
changes by Swammerdam, who has thrown ſuch lights upon this part of natural
hiſtory. In the ſecond order of changes, mentioned before, we ſaw the
graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper and the earwig, when excluded from the egg, aſſume a form
very like that which they <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0824000108:8"/> were after to preſerve; and
ſeemed arrived at a ſtate of perfection, in all reſpects, except in not
having wings; which did not bud forth until they were come to maturity. But the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects of this third order, that we are now about to deſcribe, go through
a much greater variety of transformations: for, when they are excluded from the
egg, they aſſume the form of a ſmall caterpillar, which feeds and grows
larger every day, often changing its ſkin, but ſtill preſerving its form.
When the animal has come to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain magnitude in this ſtate, it
diſcontinues eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, makes itſelf a covering or huſk, in which it
remains wrapped up, ſeemingly without life or motion; and after having for
ſome time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this ſtate, it once more burſts its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement,
and comes forth a beautiful butterfly. Thus we ſee this animal put on no
leſs than three different appearances, from the time it is firſt excluded
from the egg. It appears a crawling caterpillar; then an inſenſible
aurelia, as it is called, without life or motion; and laſtly, a butterfly,
variouſly painted, according to its different kind. Having thus
diſtinguiſhed this claſs of inſects from all others, we will firſt
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey their hiſtory in general; and then enter par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly into the
manners and nature of a few of them, which moſt deſerve our curioſity and
attention.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the Transformations of the Caterpillar into its
correſponding Butterfly or Moth.</head>
               <p>WHEN winter has diſrobed the trees of their leaves, Nature
then ſeems to have loſt her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects. There are thouſands of different
kinds, with and without wings; which, though ſwarming at other ſeaſons,
then entirely diſappear. Our fields are re-peopled, when the leaves begin to
bud, by the genial influence of ſpring; and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars, of various
ſorts, are ſeen feeding upon the promiſe of the year, even before the
leaves are completely unfolded. Thoſe caterpillars, which we then ſee, may
ſerve to give us a view of the general means which Nature employs to
preſerve ſuch a number of inſects during that ſeaſon, when they can
no longer find ſubſiſtence. It is known, by united experience, that all
theſe animals are hatched from the eggs of butterflies; and thoſe who
obſerve them more cloſely, will find the fly very careful in depoſiting
its eggs in thoſe places where they are likely to be hatched with the
greateſt ſafety and ſucceſs. During winter, therefore, the greateſt
number of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars are in an egg ſtate; and in this lifeleſs 
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0824000108:10"/> ſituation, brave all the rigours and the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the
climate: and though often expoſed to all its changes, ſtill preſerve the
latent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of life, which is more fully exerted at the approach of
ſpring. That ſame power that puſhes forth the budding leaf, and the
opening flower, impels the inſect into animation; and Nature at once ſeems
to furniſh the gueſt and the banquet. When the inſect has found force to
break its ſhell, it always finds its favourite aliments provided in abundance
before it.</p>
               <p>But all caterpillars are not ſent off from the egg in the
beginning of ſpring; for many of them have ſubſiſted during the winter
in their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia ſtate: in which, as we have briefly obſerved above, the
animal is ſeemingly deprived of life and motion. In this ſtate of
inſenſibility, many of theſe inſects continue during the rigours of
winter; ſome encloſed in a kind of ſhell, which they have ſpun for
themſelves at the end of autumn; ſome concealed under the bark of trees;
others in the chinks of old walls; and many buried under ground. From all
theſe, a variety of butterflies are ſeen to iſſue, in the beginning of
ſpring; and adorn the earlieſt part of the year with their painted
flutterings.</p>
               <p>Some caterpillars do not make any change whatſoever at the
approach of winter; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0824000108:11"/> to live in their reptile
ſtate, through all the ſeverity of the ſeaſon. Theſe chuſe
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome retreat, where they may remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed for ſome
months together; and there they remain, quite motionleſs, and as
inſenſible as if they were actually dead. Their conſtitution is ſuch,
that food, at that time, would be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and the cold prevents their
making thoſe diſſipations which require reſtoration. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
caterpillars of this kind are found in great numbers together, encloſed in
one common web, that covers them all, and ſerves to protect them from the
injuries of the air.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there are ſome of the caterpillar kind, whoſe
butterflies live all the winter; and who, having fluttered about for ſome
part of the latter end of autumn, ſeek for ſome retreat during the winter,
in order to anſwer the ends of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, at the approach of ſpring.
Theſe are often found lifeleſs and motionleſs in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of trees,
or the clefts of timber; but, by being approached to the fire, they recover
life and activity, and ſeem to anticipate the deſires of the ſpring.</p>
               <p>In general, however, whether the animal has ſubſiſted in
an egg ſtate, during the winter; or whether as a butterfly, bred from an
aurelia, in the beginning of ſpring; or a butterfly that <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0824000108:12"/>
has ſubſiſted during the winter, and lays eggs as ſoon as the leaves of
plants are ſhot forward, the whole ſwarm of caterpillars are in motion to
ſnare the banquet that Nature has provided. There is ſcarce a plant that
has not its own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar inſects; and ſome are known to ſupport
ſeveral of different kinds. Of theſe, many are hatched from the egg, at the
foot of the tree, and climb up to its leaves for ſubſiſtence: the eggs of
others, have been glued by the parent butterfly to the leaves; and they are no
ſooner excluded from the ſhell, but they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the midſt
of plenty.</p>
               <p>When the caterpillar firſt burſts from the egg, it is
ſmall and feeble; its appetites are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its ſize, and it
ſeems to make no great conſumption: but as it encreaſes in magnitude, it
improves in its appetites; ſo that, in its adult caterpillar ſtate, it is
the moſt ravenous of all animals whatſoever. A ſingle caterpillar will
eat double its own weight of leaves in a day, and yet ſeems no way
diſordered by the meal.—What would mankind do, if their oxen or their
horſes were ſo voracious!</p>
               <p>Theſe voracious habits, with its ſlow crawling motion, but
ſtill more a ſtinging like that of nettles, which follows upon handling the
greateſt number of them, make theſe inſects not the moſt 
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0824000108:13"/> agreeable objects of human curioſity. However, there are
many philoſophers who have ſpent years in their contemplation; and who have
not only attended to their habits and labours, but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely examined their
ſtructure and internal conformation.</p>
               <p>The body of the caterpillar, when anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically conſidered, is
found compoſed of rings, whoſe circumference is pretty near circular or
oval. They are generally twelve in number, and are all membraneous; by which
caterpillars may be diſtinguiſhed from many other inſects, that nearly
reſemble them in form. The head of the caterpillar is connected to the
firſt ring by the neck; that is generally ſo ſhort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, that
it is ſcarce viſible. All the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the head in caterpillars ſeems
to conſiſt of a ſhell; and they have neither upper nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der jaw, for
they are both placed rather verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and each jaw armed with a large thick
tooth, which is ſingly equal to numbers. With theſe the animals devour
their food in ſuch amazing quantities; and with theſe, ſome of the kind
defend themſelves againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Though the mouth be kept ſhut,
the teeth are always uncovered; and while the inſect is in health, they are
ſeldom without employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whatever the caterpillar devours, theſe 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0824000108:14"/> teeth ſerve to chop it into ſmall pieces, and render
the parts of the leaf fit for ſwallowing. Many kinds, while they are yet
young, eat only the ſucculent part of the leaf, and leave all the fibres
untouched; others, however, attack the whole leaf, and eat it clean away. One
may be amuſed, for a little time, in obſerving the avidity with which they
are ſeen to feed; ſome are ſeen eating the whole day; others have their
hours of repaſt; ſome chuſe the night, and others the day. When the
caterpillar attacks a leaf, it places its body in ſuch a manner that the edge
of the leaf ſhall fall between its feet, which keeps it ſteady, while the
teeth are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in cutting it: theſe fall upon the leaf, ſomewhat in
the manner of a pair of gardener's ſheers; and every morſel is ſwallowed
as ſoon as cut. Some caterpillars feed upon leaves ſo very narrow, that
they are not broader than their mouths; in this caſe the animal is ſeen to
devour it from the point, as we would eat a radiſh.</p>
               <p>As there are various kinds of caterpillars, the numbers of their
feet are various; ſome having eight, and ſome ſixteen. Of theſe feet
the ſix foremoſt are covered with a ſort of ſhining griſtle; and are
therefore called the ſhelly legs. The hindmoſt feet, whatever be 
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0824000108:15"/> their number, are ſoft and flexible, and are called
membranaceous. Caterpillars alſo, with regard to their external figure, are
either ſmooth, or hairy. The ſkin of the firſt kind is ſoft to the
touch, or hard, like ſhagreen; the ſkin of the latter, is hairy, and as it
were thorny; and generally, if handled, ſtings like nettles. Some of them
even cauſe this ſtinging pain, if but approached too nearly.</p>
               <p>Caterpillars, in general, have ſix ſmall black ſpots
placed on the circumference of the fore ring, and a little to the ſide of the
head. Three of theſe are larger than the reſt, and are convex and
tranſparent: theſe Reaumur takes to be the eyes of the caterpillar;
however, moſt of theſe reptiles have very little occaſion for ſight,
and ſeem only to be directed by their feeling.</p>
               <p>But the parts of the caterpillar's body which moſt juſtly
demand our attention, are the ſtigmata, as they are called; or thoſe holes
on the ſides of its body, through which the animal is ſuppoſed to
breathe. All along this inſect's body, on each ſide, theſe holes are
eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable. They are eighteen in number, nine on a ſide, rather
nearer the belly than the back; a hole for every ring, of which the animal's
body is compoſed, except the ſecond, the third, and the laſt. Theſe
oval openings may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0824000108:16"/> as ſo many mouths,
through which the inſect breathes; but with this difference, that as we have
but one pair of lungs, the caterpillar has no leſs than eighteen. It requires
no great anatomical dexterity to diſcover theſe lungs in the larger kind of
caterpillars: they appear, at firſt view, to be hollow cartilaginous tubes,
and of the colour of mother-of-pearl. Theſe tubes are often ſeen to unite
with each other; ſome are perceived to open into the inteſtines; and ſome
go to different parts of the ſurface of the body. That theſe veſſels
ſerve to convey the air, appears evidently, from the famous expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of
Malpighi; who, by ſtopping up the mouths of the ſtigmata with oil, quickly
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated the animal, which was ſeen to die con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed the inſtant
after. In order to aſcertain his theory, he rubbed oil upon other parts of
the inſect's body, leaving the ſtigmata free; and this ſeemed to have no
effect upon the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal's health, but it continued to move and eat as uſual:
he rubbed oil on the ſtigmata of one ſide, and the animal underwent a
partial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, but recovered ſoon after. However, it ought to be
obſerved, that air is not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to theſe as to the nobler
ranks of animals, ſince caterpillars will live in an exhauſted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
for ſeveral days together; and though <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0824000108:17"/> they ſeem dead
at the bottom, yet, when taken out, recover, and reſume their former
vivacity.</p>
               <p>If the caterpillar be cut open longitudinally along the back,
its inteſtines will be perceived running directly in a ſtraight line from
the mouth to the anus. They reſemble a number of ſmall bags opening into
each other; and ſtrengthened on both ſides by a fleſhy cord, by which
they are united. Theſe inſects are, upon many occaſions, ſeen to caſt
forth the internal coat of their inteſtines with their food, in the changes
which they ſo frequently undergo. But the inteſtines take up but a ſmall
part of the animal's body, if compared to the fatty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which
they are involved. This ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance changes its colour when the inſect's
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis begins to approach; and from white it is uſually ſeen to
become yellow. If to theſe parts, we add the caterpillar's imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for
ſpinning, (for all caterpillars ſpin at one time or another) we ſhall
have a rude ſketch of this animal's conformation: however, we ſhall
reſerve the deſcription of thoſe parts, till we come to the hiſtory of
the ſilk-worm, where the manner in which theſe inſects ſpin their webs,
will moſt properly find place.</p>
               <p>The life of a caterpillar ſeems one continued ſucceſſion
of changes; and it is ſeen to throw off <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0824000108:18"/> one ſkin only
to aſſume another; which alſo is diveſted in its turn: and thus for
eight or ten times ſucceſſively. We muſt not, however, confound this
changing of the ſkin with the great metamorphoſis which it is afterwards to
undergo. The throwing off one ſkin, and aſſuming another, ſeems, in
compariſon, but a ſlight operation among theſe animals: this is but the
work of a day; the other is the great adventure of their lives. Indeed, this
faculty of changing the ſkin, is not peculiar to caterpillars only, but is
common to all the inſect kind; and even to ſome animals that claim a higher
rank in nature. We have already ſeen the lobſter and the crab out-growing
their firſt ſhells, and then burſting from their confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in order
to aſſume a covering more roomy and convenient. It is probable that the
louſe, the flea, and the ſpider, change their covering from the ſame
neceſſity; and growing too large for the cruſt in which they have been
for ſome time encloſed, burſt it for another. This period is probably
that of their growth; for as ſoon as their new ſkin is hardened round them,
the animal's growth is neceſſarily cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed, while it remains
within it. With reſpect to caterpillars, many of them change their ſkins
five or ſix times in a ſeaſon; and <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0824000108:19"/> this covering,
when caſt off, often ſeems ſo complete, that many might miſtake the
empty ſkin for the real inſect. Among the hairy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars, for
inſtance, the caſt ſkin is covered with hair; the feet, as well griſtly
as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braneous, remain fixed to it; even the parts which nothing but a
microſcope can diſcover, are viſible in it; in ſhort, all the parts of
the head; not only the ſkull, but the teeth.</p>
               <p>In proportion as the time approaches in which the caterpillar is
to caſt its old ſkin, its colours become more feeble, the ſkin ſeems to
wither and grow dry, and in ſome meaſure reſembles a leaf, when it is no
longer ſupplied with moiſture from the ſtock. At that time, the inſect
begins to find itſelf under a neceſſity of changing; and it is not
effected without violent labour, and perhaps pain. A day or two before the
critical hour approaches, the inſect ceaſes to eat, loſes its uſual
activity, and ſeems to reſt immoveable. It ſeeks ſome place to remain
in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; and no longer timorous, ſeems regardleſs even of the touch.
It is now and then ſeen to bend itſelf and elevate its back; again it
ſtretches to its utmoſt extent: it ſometimes lifts up the head, and then
lets it fall again; it ſometimes waves it three or four times from ſide to
ſide, and then remains in quiet. At length, ſome of <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0824000108:20"/>
within from the view; but in others, where it is more tranſparent, the
caterpillar, when it has done ſpinning, ſtrikes into it the claws of the
two feet under the tail, and afterwards forces in the tail itſelf, by
contracting thoſe claws, and violently ſtriking the feet one againſt the
other. If, however, they be taken from their web at this time, they appear in a
ſtate of great languor; and, incapable of walking, remain on that ſpot
where they are placed. In this condition they remain one or two days,
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to change into an aurelia; ſomewhat in the manner they made
preparations for changing their ſkin. They then appear with their bodies bent
into a bow, which they now and then are ſeen to ſtraiten: they make no
uſe of their legs; but if they attempt to change place, do it by the
contortions of their body. In proportion as their change into an aurelia
approaches, their body becomes more and more bent; while their extenſions and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive contractions become more frequent. The hinder end of the body is
the part which the animal firſt diſengages from its caterpillar ſkin;
that part of the ſkin remains empty, while the body is drawn up contractedly
towards the head. In the ſame manner they diſengage themſelves from the
two ſucceeding rings; ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
the animal is then lodged entirely in the <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0824000108:21"/> fore part of its
caterpillar covering: that half which is abandoned, remains flacid and empty;
while the fore part, on the contrary, is ſwolen and diſtended. The animal,
having thus quitted the hinder part of its ſkin, to drive itſelf up into
the fore part, ſtill continues to heave and work as before; ſo that the
ſkull is ſoon ſeen to burſt into three pieces, and a longitudinal
opening is made in the three firſt rings of the body, through which the
inſect thruſts forth its naked body, with ſtrong efforts. Thus at laſt,
it entirely gets free from its cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar ſkin, and for ever forſakes its
moſt odious reptile form.</p>
               <p>The caterpillar, thus ſtripped of its ſkin for the laſt
time, is now become an aurelia; in which the parts of the future butterfly are
all viſible; but in ſo ſoft a ſtate, that the ſmalleſt touch can
diſcompoſe them. The animal is now become helpleſs and motionleſs; but
only waits for the aſſiſtance of the air to dry up the moiſture on its
ſurface, and ſupply it with a cruſt capable of reſiſting external
injuries. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after being ſtripped of its caterpillar ſkin, it is
of a green colour, eſpecially in thoſe parts which are diſtended by an
extraordinary afflux of animal moiſture; but in ten or twelve hours after
being thus expoſed, its parts harden, <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0824000108:22"/>

glutinous ſilk, make a kind of paſte, in which they wrap themſelves up.
Many are the forms which theſe animals aſſume in this help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſtate; and it often happens, that the moſt deformed butterflies iſſue
from the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful aurelias.</p>
               <p>In general, however, the aurelia takes the rude outline of the
parts of the animal which is contained within it; but as to the various
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours which it is ſeen to aſſume, they are rather the effect of
accident; for the ſame ſpecies of inſect does not at all times aſſume
the ſame hue, when it becomes an aurelia. In ſome, the beautiful gold
colour is at one time found; in others, it is wanting. This brilliant hue,
which does not fall ſhort of the beſt gilding, is formed in the ſame
manner in which we ſee leather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a gold colour, though none of that
metal ever enters into the tincture. It is only formed by a beautiful brown
varniſh, laid upon a white ground; and the white thus gleaming through the
tranſparency of the brown, gives a charming golden yellow. Theſe two
colours are found, one over the other, in the aurelia of the little animal we
are deſcribing; and the whole ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears gilded, without any real gilding.</p>
               <p>The aurelia thus formed, and left to time to expand into a
butterfly, in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0824000108:25"/> an animal in
an egg, that is to wait for external warmth to hatch it into life and vigour.
As the quantity of moiſture that is encloſed within the covering of the
aurelia, continues to keep its body in the moſt tender ſtate, ſo it is
requiſite that this humidity ſhould be dried away, before the little
butterfly can burſt its priſon. Many have been the experiments to prove
that nature may in this reſpect be aſſiſted by art; and that the life
of the inſect may be retarded or quickened, without doing it the ſmalleſt
injury. For this purpoſe, it is only requiſite to continue the inſect in
its aurelia ſtate, by preventing the evaporation of its hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity; which will
conſequently add ſome days, nay weeks, to its life: on the other hand, by
evaporating its moiſture, in a warm ſituation, the animal aſſumes its
winged ſtate before its uſual time, and goes through the offices
aſſigned its exiſtence. To prove this, Mr. Reaumur encloſed the aurelia
in a glaſs tube; and found the evaporated water, which exhaled from the body
of the inſect, collected in drops at the bottom of the tube: he covered the
aurelia with varniſh; and this making the evaporation more difficult and
ſlow, the butterfly was two months longer than its natural term, in coming
out of its caſe: he found, on the other hand, <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0824000108:26"/> that by
laying the animal in a warm room, he haſtened the diſcloſure of the
butterfly; and by keeping it in an ice-houſe in the ſame manner, he delayed
it. Warmth acted, in this caſe, in a double capacity; invigorating the
animal, and evaporating the moiſture.</p>
               <p>The aurelia, though it bears a different ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal appearance,
nevertheleſs contains within it all the parts of the butterfly in perfect
form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and lying each in a very orderly manner, though in the ſmalleſt
compaſs. Theſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are ſo faſt and tender, that it is
impoſſible to viſit without diſcompoſing them. When either by warmth,
or encreaſing vigour, the parts have acquired the neceſſary force and
ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, the butterfly then ſeeks to diſembarraſs itſelf of thoſe
bands which kept it ſo long in confinement. Some inſects continue under the
form of an aurelia not above ten days; ſome twenty; ſome ſeveral months;
and even for a year together.</p>
               <p>The butterfly, however, does not continue ſo long under the
form of an aurelia, as one would be apt to imagine. In general, thoſe
caterpillars that provide hemſelves with cones, continue within them but a
few days after the cone is completely finiſhed. Some, however, remain buried
in this artificial covering for eight <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0824000108:27"/> or nine months,
without taking the ſmalleſt ſuſtenance during the whole time: and
though in the caterpillar ſtate no animals were ſo vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, when thus
transformed, they appear a miracle of abſtinence. In all, ſooner or later,
the butterfly burſts from its priſon; not only that natural priſon which
is formed by the ſkin of the aurelia, but alſo from that artificial one of
ſilk, or any other ſubſtance in which it has encloſed itſelf.</p>
               <p>The efforts which the butterfly makes to get free from its
aurelia ſtate, are by no means ſo violent as thoſe which the inſect had
in changing from the caterpillar into the aurelia. The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of moiſture
ſurrounding the butterfly is by no means ſo great as that attending its
former change; and the ſhell of the aurelia is ſo dry, that it may be
cracked between the fingers.</p>
               <p>If the animal be ſhut up within a cone, the butterfly always
gets rid of the natural internal ſkin of the aurelia, before it eats its way
through the external covering which its own induſtry has formed round it. In
order to obſerve the manner in which it thus gets rid of the aurelia
covering, we muſt cut open the cone, and then we ſhall have an opportunity
of diſcovering the inſect's efforts to emancipate itſelf from its natural
ſhell. When this operation begins, there <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0824000108:28"/> ſeems to be a
violent agitation in the humours contained within the little animal's body. Its
fluids ſeem driven, by an haſty fermentation, through all the veſſels;
while it labours violently with its legs, and makes ſeveral other violent
ſtruggles to get free. As all theſe motions concur with the growth of the
inſect's wings and body, it is impoſſible that the brittle ſkin which
covers it ſhould longer reſiſt: it at length gives way, by burſting
into four diſtinct and regular pieces. The ſkin of the head and legs
firſt ſeparates; then the ſkin at the back flies open, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding into
two regular portions, diſengages the back and wings: then there likewiſe
happens another rupture in that portion which covered the rings of the back of
the aurelia. After this, the butterfly, as if fatigued with its ſtruggles,
remains very quiet for ſome time, with its wings pointed downwards, and its
legs fixed in the ſkin which it had juſt thrown off. At firſt ſight the
animal, juſt ſet free, and permitted the future uſe of its wings, ſeems
to want them entirely: they take up ſuch little room, that one would wonder
where they were hidden. But ſoon after, they expand ſo rapidly, that the
eye can ſcarce attend their unfolding. From reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce half the
length of the body, they acquire, in a moſt wonderful manner, their full 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0824000108:29"/> extent and bigneſs, ſo as to be each five times larger
than they were before. Nor is it the wings alone that are thus encreaſed: all
their ſpots and paintings, before ſo minute as to be ſcarce
diſcernible, are proportionably extended; ſo that, what a few minutes
before ſeemed only a number of confuſed, unmeaning points, now become
diſtinct and moſt beautiful ornaments. Nor are the wings, when they are
thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded, unfolded in the manner in which ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wigs and graſshoppers
diſplay theirs, who unfurl them like a lady's fan: on the contrary, thoſe
of butterflies actually grow to their natural ſize in this very ſhort
ſpace. The wing, at the inſtant it is freed from its late confinement, is
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably thicker than afterwards; ſo that it ſpreads in all its
dimenſions, growing thinner as it becomes broader. If one of the wings be
plucked from the animal juſt ſet free, it may be ſpread by the fingers,
and it will ſoon become as broad as the other, which has been left behind. As
the wings extend themſelves ſo ſuddenly, they have not yet had time to
dry; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly appear like pieces of wet paper, ſoft, and full of
wrinkles. In about half an hour, they are perfectly dry, their wrinkles
entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear, and the little animal aſſumes all its ſplendor.
The tranſmutation being thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0824000108:30"/> finiſhed, the
butterfly diſcharges three or four drops of a blood-coloured liquid, which
are the laſt remains of its ſuperfluous moiſture. Thoſe aurelias which
are encloſed within a cone, find their exit ſtill more difficult, as they
have ſtill another priſon to break through: this, however, they perform in
a ſhort time; for the butterfly, freed from its aurelia ſkin, butts with
its head violently againſt the walls of its artificial priſon; and probably
with its eyes, that are rough and like a file, it rubs the internal ſurface
away; till it is at laſt ſeen burſting its way into open light; and, in
leſs than a quarter of an hour, the animal acquires its full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Thus, to uſe the words of Swammerdam, we ſee a little
inſignificant creature diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, in its laſt birth, with
qualifications and ornaments, which man, during his ſtay upon earth, can
never even hope to acquire. The butterfly, to enjoy life, needs no other food
but the dews of Heaven; and the honeyed juices which are diſtilled from every
flower. The pageantry of princes cannot equal the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which it is
inveſted; nor the rich colouring that embelliſhes its wings. The ſkies
are the butterfly's proper habitation, and the air its element: whilſt man
comes into the <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0824000108:31"/> world naked, and often roves about without
habitation or ſhelter; expoſed, on one hand, to the heat of the ſun; and,
on the other, to the damps and exhalations of the earth; both alike enemies of
his happineſs and exiſtence.—A ſtrong proof that, while this little
animal is raiſed to its greateſt height, we are as yet, in this world, only
candidates for perfection!</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of Butterflies and Moths.</head>
               <p>IT has been already ſhewn that all Butterflies are bred from
caterpillars; and we have exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the various circumſtances of that
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing change. It has been remarked, that butterflies may be eaſily
diſtinguiſhed from flies of every other kind, by their wings; for, in
others, they are either tranſparent, like gauze, as we ſee in the common
fleſh fly; or they are hard and cruſted, as we ſee in the wings of the
beetle. But in the butterfly, the wings are ſoft, opake, and painted over
with a beautiful duſt, that comes off with handling.</p>
               <p>The number of theſe beautiful animals is very great; and
though Linnaeus has reckoned up above ſeven hundred and ſixty different
kinds, the catalogue is ſtill very incomplete. Every collector of butterflies
can ſhew undeſcribed ſpecies: and ſuch as are fond of minute
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, can here produce animals that have been examined only by
himſelf. In general, however, thoſe of the warm climates, are larger and
more beautiful than ſuch as are bred at home; and we can eaſily admit the
beauty of <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0824000108:33"/> the butterfly, ſince we are thus freed from
the damage of the caterpillar. It has been the amuſement of ſome to collect
theſe animals, from different parts of the world; or to breed them from
caterpillars at home. Theſe they arrange in ſyſtematic order; or
diſpoſe ſo as to make ſtriking and agreeable pictures: and all muſt
grant, that this ſpecious idleneſs is far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to that unhappy
ſtate which is produced by a total want of employment.</p>
               <p>The wings of butterflies, as was obſerved, fully
diſtinguiſh them from flies of every other kind. They are four in number;
and though two of them be cut off, the animal can fly with the two others
remaining. They are, in their own ſubſtance, tranſparent; but owe their
opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to the beautiful duſt with which they are covered; and which has
been likened, by ſome naturaliſts, to the feathers of birds; by others, to
the ſcales of fiſhes; as their imaginations were diſpoſed to catch the
reſemblance. In fact, if we regard the wing of a butterfly with a good
microſcope, we ſhall perceive it ſtudded over with a variety of little
grains of different dimenſions and forms, generally ſupported upon a
footſtalk, regularly laid upon the whole ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. Nothing can exceed the
beautiful and regular arrangement of theſe little ſubſtances; 
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0824000108:34"/> which thus ſerve to paint the butterfly's wing, like the
tiles of an houſe. Thoſe of one rank are a little covered by thoſe that
follow: they are of many figures: on one part of the wing may be ſeen a
ſucceſſion of oval ſtuds; on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, a cluſter of ſtuds,
each in the form of an heart: in one place they reſemble a hand open; and in
another they are long or trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; while all are interſperſed with
taller ſtuds, that grow between the reſt, like muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms upon a ſtalk.
The wing itſelf is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſeveral thick nerves, which render the
conſtruction very ſtrong, though light; and though it be covered over with
thouſands of theſe ſcales or ſtuds, yet its weight is very little
encreaſed by the number. The animal is with eaſe enabled to ſupport
itſelf a long while in air, although its flight be not very graceful. When it
deſigns to fly to a conſiderable diſtance, it aſcends and deſcends
alternately; going ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the right, ſometimes to the left, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any apparent reaſon. Upon cloſer exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, however, it will be found
that it flies thus irregularly in purſuit of its mate; and as dogs bait and
quarter the ground in purſuit of their game, ſo theſe inſects
traverſe the air, in queſt of their mates, whom they can diſcover at more
than a mile's diſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0824000108:35"/>If we proſecute our deſcription of the
but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfly, the animal may be divided into three parts; the head, the
corſelet, and the body.</p>
               <p>The body is the hinder part of the butterfly, and is compoſed
of rings, which are generally concealed under long hair, with which that part
of the animal is cloathed. The corſelet is more ſolid than the reſt of
the body, becauſe the fore wings, and the legs, are fixed therein. The legs
are ſix in number, although four only are made uſe of by the animal; the
two fore legs being often ſo much concealed in the long hair of the body,
that it is ſometimes difficult to diſcover them. If we examine theſe
parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, we ſhall find the ſame ſet of veſſels in the
butterfly that we obſerved in the caterpillar, but with this great
difference; that as the blood, or humours, in the caterpillar, circulated from
the tail to the head, they are found, in the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfly, to take a direct
contrary courſe, and to circulate from the head to the tail; ſo that the
caterpillar may be conſidered as the embryo animal, in which, as we have
formerly ſeen, the circulation is carried on differently from what it is in
animals when excluded.</p>
               <p>But leaving the other parts of the butterfly, let us turn our
attention particularly to the head. The eyes of butterflies have not all the
ſame <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0824000108:36"/> form; for, in ſome they are large, in others
ſmall; in ſome they are the larger portion of a ſphere, in others they
are but a ſmall part of it, and juſt appearing from the head. In all of
them, however, the outward coat has a luſtre, in which may be diſcovered
the various colours of the rainbow. When examined a little cloſely, it will
be found to have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a multiplying glaſs; having a great
number of ſides, or facets, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a brilliant cut diamond. In
this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the eye of the butterfly, and of moſt other inſects,
entirely correſpond; and Luen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoek pretends, there are above ſix thouſand
facets on the cornea of a flea. Theſe animals, therefore, ſee not only with
great clearneſs; but view every object multiplied in a ſurprizing manner.
Puget adapted the cornea of a fly in ſuch a poſition, as to ſee objects
through it by the means of a microſcope; and nothing could exceed the
ſtrangeneſs of its repreſentations: a ſoldier, who was ſeen through
it, appeared like an army of pigmies; for while it multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, it alſo
diminiſhed the object: the arch of a bridge exhibited a ſpectacle more
magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent than human ſkill could perform; the flame of a candle ſeemed a
beautiful illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It ſtill, however, remains a doubt, 
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0824000108:37"/> whether the inſect ſees objects ſingly, as with one
eye; or whether every facet is itſelf a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete eye, exhibiting its own
object diſtinct from all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Butterflies, as well as moſt other flying inſects, have two
inſtruments, like horns, on their heads, which are commonly called feelers.
They dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the horns of greater animals, in being moveable at their
baſe; and in having a great number of joints, by which means the inſect is
enabled to turn them in every direction. Thoſe of butterflies are placed at
the top of the head, pretty near the external edge of each eye. What the uſe
of theſe inſtruments may be, which are thus formed with ſo much art, and
by a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who does nothing without reaſon, is as yet unknown to man. They
may ſerve to guard the eye; they may be of uſe to clean it; or they may be
the organ of ſome ſenſe which we are ignorant of: but this is only
explaining one difficulty by another.</p>
               <p>We are not ſo ignorant of the uſes of the trunk, which few
inſects of the butterfly kind are without. This inſtrument is placed
exactly between the eyes; and when the animal is not employed in ſeeking its
nouriſhment, it is rolled up, like a curl. A butterfly, when it is feeding,
flies round ſome flower, and ſettles upon it. <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0824000108:38"/> The
trunk is then uncurled, and thruſt out either wholly or in part; and is
employed in ſearching the flower to its very bottom, let it be never ſo
deep. This ſearch being repeated ſeven or eight times, the butterfly then
paſſes to another; and continues to hover over thoſe agreeable to its
taſte, like a bird over its prey. This trunk conſiſts of two equal hollow
tubes, nicely joined to each other, like the pipes of an organ.</p>
               <p>Such is the figure and conformation of theſe beautiful
inſects, that cheer our walks, and give us the earlieſt intimations of
ſummer. But it is not by day alone that they are ſeen fluttering wantonly
from flower to flower, as the greateſt number of them fly by night, and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand the moſt beautiful colouring, at thoſe hours when there is no
ſpectator. This tribe of inſects has therefore been divided into Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal
and Nocturnal Flies; or, more properly ſpeaking, into Butterflies and Moths:
the one only flying by day, the other moſt uſually on the wing in the
night. They may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from each other, by their horns
or feelers: thoſe of the butterfly being clubbed, or knobbed at the end;
thoſe of the moth, tapering finer and finer to a point. To expreſs it
technically—the feelers of butterflies are cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated; thoſe of moths,
are filiform.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0824000108:39"/>The butterflies, as well as the moths,
employ the ſhort life aſſigned them, in a variety of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. Their
whole time is ſpent either in queſt of food, which every flower offers; or
in purſuit of the female, whoſe approach they can often perceive at above
two miles diſtance. Their ſagacity in this particular is not leſs
aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing than true; but by what ſenſe they are thus capable of
diſtinguiſhing each other at ſuch diſtances, is not eaſy to conceive.
It cannot be by the ſight, ſince ſuch ſmall objects as they are muſt
be utterly imperceptible, at half the diſtance at which they perceive each
other: it can ſcarcely be by the ſenſe of ſmelling, ſince the animal
has no organs for that purpoſe. Whatever be their powers of perception,
certain it is, that the male, after having fluttered, as if careleſly, about
for ſome time, is ſeen to take wing, and go forward, ſometimes for two
miles together, in a direct line to where the female is perched on a
flower.</p>
               <p>The general rule among inſects is, that the female is larger
than the male; and this obtains particularly in the tribe I am deſcribing.
The body of the male is ſmaller and ſlenderer; that of the female, more
thick and oval. Previous to the junction of theſe animals, they are ſeen
ſporting in the air, purſuing and flying from <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0824000108:40"/> each
other, and preparing, by a mock combat, for the more important buſineſs of
their lives. If they be diſturbed while united, the female flies off with the
male on her back, who ſeems entirely paſſive upon the occaſion.</p>
               <p>But the females of many moths and butterflies ſeem to have
aſſumed their airy form for no other reaſon but to fecundate their eggs,
and lay them. They are not ſeen fluttering about in queſt of food, or a
mate: all that paſſes, during their ſhort lives, is a junction with the
male of about half an hour; after which they depoſite their eggs, and die,
without taking any nouriſhment, or ſeeking any. It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
however, that in all the females of this tribe, they are impregnated by the
male by one aperture, and lay their eggs by another.</p>
               <p>The eggs of female butterflies are diſpoſed in the body like
a bed of chaplets; which, when excluded, are uſually oval, and of a whitiſh
colour: ſome, however, are quite round; and others flatted, like a turnip.
The covering or ſhell of the egg, though ſolid, is thin and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent;
and in proportion as the caterpillar grows within the egg, the colours change,
and are diſtributed differently. The butterfly ſeems very well inſtructed
by nature in its choice of the plant, or the leaf, where it ſhall depoſite
its <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0824000108:41"/> burthen. Each egg contains but one caterpillar; and it
is requiſite that this little animal, when excluded, ſhould be near its
peculiar proviſion. The butterfly, therefore, is careful to place her brood
only upon thoſe plants that afford good nouriſhment to its poſterity.
Though the little winged animal has been fed itſelf upon dew, or the honey of
flowers, yet it makes choice for its young of a very different proviſion, and
lays its eggs on the moſt unſavoury plants; the rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed, the cabbage, or
the nettle. Thus every butterfly chuſes not the plant moſt grateful to it
in its winged ſtate; but ſuch as it has fed upon in its reptile form.</p>
               <p>All the eggs of butterflies are attached to the leaves of the
favourite plant, by a ſort of ſize or glue; where they continue,
unobſerved, unleſs carefully ſought after. The eggs are ſometimes
placed round the tender ſhoots of plants, in the form of bracelets,
conſiſting of above two hundred in each, and generally ſurrounding the
ſhoot, like a ring upon a finger. Some butterflies ſecure their eggs from
the injuries of air, by covering them with hair, plucked from their own bodies,
as birds ſometimes are ſeen to make their neſts; ſo that their eggs are
thus kept warm, and alſo entirely concealed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0824000108:42"/>All the tribe of female moths lay their eggs
a ſhort time after they leave the aurelia; but there are many butterflies
that flutter about the whole ſummer, and do not think of laying, till the
winter begins to warn them of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching end: ſome even continue the
whole winter in the hollows of trees, and do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for poſterity until
the beginning of April, when they leave their retreats, depoſite their eggs,
and die. Their eggs ſoon begin to feel the genial influence of the
ſeaſon: the little animals burſt from them in their caterpillar ſtate,
to become aurelias, and butterflies in their turn; and thus to continue the
round of nature.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Enemies of the Caterpillar.</head>
               <p>NATURE, though it has rendered ſome animals ſurprizingly
fruitful, yet ever takes care to prevent their too great encreaſe. One ſet
of creatures is generally oppoſed to another: and thoſe are chiefly the
moſt prolific, that are, from their imbecility, incapable of making any
effectual defence. The caterpillar has perhaps, of all other animals, the
greateſt number of enemies; and ſeems only to exiſt, by its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
fecundity. Some animals devour them by hundreds; others, more minute, yet more
dangerous, mangle them in various ways: ſo that, how great ſoever their
numbers may be, their deſtroyers are in equal proportion. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we
conſider the miſchiefs theſe reptiles are capable of occaſioning, and
the various da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages we ſuſtain from their inſatiable rapacity, it is
happy for the other ranks of nature, that there are thouſands of fiſhes,
birds, and even inſects, that live chiefly upon caterpillars, and make them
their moſt favourite repaſt.</p>
               <p>When we deſcribed the little birds that live in our gardens,
and near our houſes, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0824000108:44"/> neighbours,
ſufficient attention was not paid to the ſervices which they are
fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently found to render us. It has been proved, that a ſingle ſparrow
and its mate, that have young ones, deſtroy above three thouſand
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars in a week; not to mention ſeveral butterflies, in which
numberleſs caterpillars are deſtroyed in embryo. It is in purſuit of
theſe reptiles that we are favoured with the viſits of many of our moſt
beautiful ſongſters; that amuſe us during their continuance, and leave us
when the caterpillars diſappear.</p>
               <p>The maxim which has often been urged againſt man, that he, of
all other animals, is the only creature that is an enemy to his own kind, and
that the human ſpecies only are found to deſtroy each other, has been
adopted, by perſons who never conſidered the hiſtory of inſects. Some
of the caterpillar kind in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that ſeem fitted only to live upon
leaves and plants, will, however, eat each other; and the ſtrongeſt will
devour the weak, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their vegetable food. That which lives upon
the oak, is found to ſeize any of its companions, which it conveniently can,
by the firſt rings, and inflict a deadly wound: it then feaſts in
tranquillity on its prey, and leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the animal but the huſk.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0824000108:45"/>But it is not from each other they have
moſt to fear, as in general they are inoffenſive; and many of this tribe
are found to live in a kind of ſociety. Many kinds of flies lay their eggs
either upon, or within their bodies; and as theſe turn into worms, the
caterpillar is ſeen to nouriſh a ſet of inteſtine enemies within its
body, that muſt ſhortly be its deſtruction: Nature having taught flies,
as well as all other animals, the ſureſt methods of perpetuating their
kind. 
<q rend="inline">"Towards the end of Auguſt," ſays Reaumur,
"I perceived a little fly, of a beautiful gold colour, buſily employed in the
body of a large caterpillar, of that kind which feeds upon cabbage. I gently
ſeparated that part of the leaf on which theſe inſects were placed, from
the reſt of the plant, and placed it where I might obſerve them more at my
eaſe. The fly, wholly taken up by the buſineſs in which it was employed,
walked along the cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar's body, now and then remaining fixed to a
particular ſpot. Upon this occaſion, I perceived it every now and then dart
a ſting, which it carried at the end of its tail, into the caterpillar's
body, and then drew it out again, to repeat the ſame operation in another
place. It was not difficult for me to conjecture the buſineſs which engaged
this animal ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly; <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0824000108:46"/> its whole aim was to
depoſite its eggs in the caterpillar's body; which was to ſerve as a proper
retreat for bringing them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The reptile thus rudely treated,
ſeemed to bear all very patiently, only mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little when ſtung too
deeply; which, however, the fly ſeemed entirely to diſregard. I took
particular care to feed this caterpillar; which ſeemed to me to continue as
voracious and vigorous as any of the reſt of its kind. In about ten or twelve
days, it changed into an aurelia, which ſeemed gradually to decline, and
died: upon examining its internal parts, the animal was entirely devoured by
worms; which, however, did not come to perfection, as it is probable they had
not enough to ſuſtain them within."</q>
               </p>
               <p>What the French philoſopher perceived upon this occaſion, is
every day to be ſeen in ſeveral of the larger kinds of caterpillars,
whoſe bodies ſerve as a neſt to various flies, that very carefully
depoſite their eggs within them. The large cabbage caterpillar is ſo
ſubject to its injuries, that, at certain ſeaſons, it is much eaſier to
find them with than without them. The ichnumon fly, as it is called,
particularly infeſts theſe rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and prevents their fecundity. This
fly is, of all others, the moſt formidable to inſects of 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0824000108:47"/> various kinds. The ſpider, that deſtroys the ant, the
moth, and the butterfly, yet often falls a prey to the ichnumon; who purſues
the robber to his retreat, and, deſpiſing his nets, tears him in pieces, in
the very labyrinth he has made. This inſect, as redoubtable as the little
quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede that deſtroys the crocodile, has received the ſame name; and
from its deſtruction of the caterpillar tribe, is probably more ſerviceable
to mankind. This inſect, I ſay, makes the body of the caterpillar the place
for depoſiting its eggs; to the number of ten, fifteen, or twenty. As they
are laid in thoſe parts which are not mortal, the reptile ſtill continues
to live, and to feed, ſhewing no ſigns of being incommoded by its new
gueſts. The caterpillar changes its ſkin; and ſometimes undergoes the
great change into an aurelia: but ſtill the fatal intruders work within, and
ſecretly devour its internal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: ſoon after they are ſeen
burſting through its ſkin, and moving away, in order to ſpin
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a covering, previous to their own little transformation. It is
indeed aſtoniſhing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſee the number of worms, and thoſe
pretty large, that thus iſſue from the body of a ſingle caterpillar, and
eat their way through its ſkin: but it is more extraordinary ſtill, that
they ſhould remain within the body, devouring its <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0824000108:48"/>
entrails, without deſtroying its life. The truth is, they ſeem inſtructed
by nature not to devour its vital parts; for they are found to feed only upon
that fatty ſubſtance which compoſes the largeſt part of the
caterpillar's body. When this ſurprizing appearance was firſt obſerved,
it was ſuppoſed that the animal thus gave birth to a number of flies,
different from itſelf; and that the ſame caterpillar ſometimes bred an
ichnumon, and ſometimes a butterfly: but it was not till after more careful
inſpection, it was diſcovered, that the ichnumon tribe were not the
caterpillar's offspring, but its murderers.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of the Silkworm.</head>
               <p>HAVING mentioned, in the laſt chapter, the damages inflicted
by the caterpillar tribe, we now come to an animal of this kind, that alone
compenſates for all the miſchief occaſioned by the reſt. This little
creature, which only works for itſelf, has been made of the utmoſt
ſervice to man; and furniſhes him with a covering more beautiful than any
other animal can ſupply. We may declaim indeed againſt the luxuries of the
times, when ſilk is ſo generally worn; but were ſuch garments to fail,
what other arts could ſupply their deficiency?</p>
               <p>Though ſilk was anciently brought in ſmall quantities to
Rome, yet it was ſo ſcarce as to be ſold for its weight in gold; and was
conſidered as ſuch a luxurious refinement in dreſs, that it was infamous
for a man to appear in habits of which ſilk formed but half the
compoſition. It was moſt probably brought among them from the remoteſt
parts of the eaſt; ſince it was, at the time of which I am ſpeaking,
ſcarcely known even in Perſia.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more remote from the truth, <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0824000108:50"/>
than the manner in which their hiſtorians deſcribe the animal by which
ſilk is produced. Pauſanias informs us, that ſilk came from the country
of the Seres, a people of Aſiatic Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia; in which place an inſect, as
large as the beetle, but in every other reſpect reſembling a ſpider, was
bred up for that purpoſe. They take great care, as he aſſures us, to feed
and defend it from the weather; as well during the ſummer's heat, as the
rigours of winter. This inſect, he obſerves, makes its web with its feet,
of which it has eight in number. It is fed, for the ſpace of four years, upon
a kind of paſte, prepared for it; and at the beginning of the fifth, it is
ſupplied with the leaves of the green willow, of which it is particularly
fond. It then feeds till it burſts with fat; after which they take out its
bowels, which are ſpun into the beautiful manufacture ſo ſcarce and
coſtly.</p>
               <p>The real hiſtory of this animal was unknown among the Romans
till the times of Juſtinian; and it is ſuppoſed, that ſilkworms were
not brought into Europe till the beginning of the twelfth century; when Roger
of Sicily, brought workmen in this manufacture from Aſia Minor, after his
return from his expedition to the Holy Land, and ſettled them in Sicily and
Calabria. From theſe the other kingdoms of Europe <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0824000108:51"/>
learned this manufacture; and it is now one of the moſt lucrative carried on
among the ſouthern provinces of Europe.</p>
               <p>The ſilkworm is now very well known to be a large caterpillar,
of a whitiſh colour, with twelve feet, and producing a butterfly of the moth
kind. The cone on which it ſpins, is formed for covering it while it
continues in the aurelia ſtate; and ſeveral of theſe, properly wound off,
and united together, form thoſe ſtrong and beautiful threads, which is
woven into ſilk. The feeding theſe worms, the gathering, the winding, the
twiſting, and the weaving their ſilk, is one of the principal manufactures
of Europe; and, as our luxuries encreaſe, ſeems every day to become more
and more neceſſary to human happineſs.</p>
               <p>There are two methods of breeding ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms; for they may be
left to grow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at liberty upon the trees where they are hatched; or
they may be kept in a place built for that purpoſe, and fed every day with
freſh leaves. The firſt method is uſed in China, Tonquin, and other hot
countries; the other is uſed in thoſe places where the animal has been
artificially propagated, and ſtill continues a ſtranger. In the warm
climates, the ſilkworm proceeds from an egg, which has been glued 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0824000108:52"/> by the parent moth upon proper parts of the mulberry-tree,
and which remains in that ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion during the winter. The manner in which
they are ſituated and fixed to the tree, keeps them unaffected by the
influence of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo that thoſe froſts which are ſevere enough
to kill the tree, have no power to injure the ſilkworm.</p>
               <p>The inſect never proceeds from the egg till Nature has
provided it a ſufficient ſupply; and till the budding leaves are
furniſhed, in ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient abundance, for its ſupport. When the leaves are
put forth, the worms ſeem to feel the genial ſummons, and burſting from
their little eggs, crawl upon the leaves, where they feed with a moſt
voracious appetite. Thus they become larger by degrees; and after ſome months
feeding, they lay, upon every leaf, ſmall bundles, or cones of ſilk, which
appear like ſo many golden apples, painted on a fine green ground. Such is
the method of breeding them in the Eaſt; and without doubt it is beſt for
the worms, and leaſt troubleſome for the feeder of them. But it is
otherwiſe in our colder European climates; the frequent changes of the
weather, and the heavy dews of our even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, render the keeping them all night
expoſed, ſubject to ſo many inconveniences, as to admit 
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0824000108:53"/> of no remedy, It is true, that by the aſſiſtance of
nets, they may be preſerved from the inſults of birds; but the ſevere
cold weather, which often ſucceeds the firſt heats of ſummer, as well as
the rain and high winds, will deſtroy them all: and, therefore, to breed them
in Europe, they muſt be ſheltered and protected from every external
injury.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe, a room is choſen, with a ſouth aſpect;
and the windows are ſo well glazed, as not to admit the leaſt air: the
walls are well built, and the planks of the floor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding cloſe, ſo as
to admit neither birds nor mice, nor even ſo much as an inſect. In the
middle there ſhould be four pillars erected, or four wooden poſts, ſo
placed as to form a pretty large ſquare. Between theſe are different
ſtories made with ozier hurdles; and under each hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle there ſhould be a
floor, with an upright bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all round. Theſe hurdles and floors muſt
hang upon pullies, ſo as to be placed, or taken down at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>When the worms are hatched, ſome tender mulberry leaves are
provided, and placed in the cloth or paper box in which the eggs were laid, and
which are large enough to hold a great number. When they have acquired ſome
ſtrength, they muſt be diſtributed on beds of <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0824000108:54"/>
mulberry leaves, in the different ſtories of the ſquare in the middle of
the room, round which a perſon may freely paſs on every ſide. They will
fix themſelves to the leaves, and afterwards to the ſticks of the hurdles,
when the leaves are devoured. They have then a thread, by which they can
ſuſpend themſelves on occaſion, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any ſhock by a fall; but
this is by no means to be conſidered as the ſilk which they ſpin
afterwards in ſuch abundance. Care muſt be taken that freſh leaves be
brought every morning, which muſt be ſtrewed very gently and equally over
them; upon which the ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms will forſake the remainder of the old
leaves, which muſt be carefully taken away, and every thing kept very clean;
for nothing hurts theſe inſects ſo much as moiſture and
unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. For this reaſon their leaves muſt be gathered when the
weather is dry, and kept in a dry place, if it be neceſſary to lay in a
ſtore. As theſe animals have but a ſhort time to live, they make uſe of
every moment, and almoſt continually are ſpinning, except at thoſe
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals when they change their ſkins. If mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry leaves be difficult to
be obtained, the leaves of lettuce or holyoak will ſuſtain them: but they
do not thrive ſo well upon their new diet; and their ſilk will neither be
ſo copious, nor of ſo good a quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0824000108:55"/>Though the judicious choice, and careful
management of their diet, is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yet there is another
precaution of equal importance, which is to give them air, and open their
chamber windows, at ſuch times as the ſun ſhines warmeſt. The place
alſo muſt be kept as clean as poſſible; not only the ſeveral floors
that are laid to receive their ordure, but the whole apartments in general.
Theſe things well obſerved, contribute greatly to their health and
encreaſe.</p>
               <p>The worm, at the the time it burſts the ſhell, is extremely
ſmall, and of a black colour; but the head is of a more ſhining black than
the reſt of the body: ſome days after, they begin to turn whitiſh, or of
an aſh-coloured grey. After the ſkin begins to grow too rigid, or he animal
is ſtinted within it, the inſect throws it off, and appears cloathed a-new:
it then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes larger and much whiter, though it has a greeniſh caſt:
after ſome days, which are more or leſs, according to the different heat of
the climate, or to the quality of the food, it leaves off eating, and ſeems
to ſleep for two days together: then it begins to ſtir, and put itſelf
into violent motions, till the ſkin falls off the ſecond time, and is
thrown aſide by the animal's feet. All theſe changes are made in three
weeks <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0824000108:56"/> may eaſily be obſerved is, that it is compoſed
externally of a kind of rough cotton-like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is called
floſs; within the thread is more diſtinct and even; and next the body of
the aurelia, the apartment ſeems lined with a ſubſtance of the hardneſs
of paper, but of a much ſtronger conſiſtence. It muſt not be
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the thread which goes to compoſe the cone, is rolled
round, as we roll a bottom; on the contrary, it lies upon it in a very
irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular manner, and winds off now from one ſide of the cone, and then from
the other. This whole thread, if meaſured, will be found about three hundred
yards long; and ſo very fine, that eight or ten of them are generally rolled
off into one by the manufacturers. The cone, when completed, is in form like a
pidgeon's egg, and more pointed at one end than the other; at the ſmaller
end, the head of the aurelia is generally found; and this is the place that the
inſect, when converted into a moth, is generally ſeen to burſt
through.</p>
               <p>It is generally a fortnight or three weeks before the aurelia is
changed into a moth; but no ſooner is the winged inſect completely formed,
than having diveſted itſelf of its aurelia ſkin, it prepares to burſt
through its cone, or outward priſon: for this purpoſe it extends its 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0824000108:57"/> head towards the point of the cone, butts with its eyes,
which are rough, againſt the lining of its cell, wears it away, and at laſt
puſhes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, through a paſſage which is ſmall at firſt, but which
enlarges as the animal encreaſes its efforts for emancipation; while the
tattered rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of its aurelia ſkin lie in confuſion within the cone,
like a bundle of dirty linen.</p>
               <p>The animal, when thus ſet free from its double confinement,
appears exhauſted with fatigue, and ſeems produced for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
but to tranſmit a future brood. It neither flies nor eats; the male only
ſeeking the female, whoſe eggs he impregnates; and their union continues
for four days, without interruption. The male dies immediately after
ſeparation from his mate; and ſhe ſurvives him only till ſhe has laid
her eggs, which are not hatched into worms till the enſuing ſpring.</p>
               <p>However, there are few of theſe animals ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to come to
a ſtate of maturity; for as their burſting through the cone deſtroys the
ſilk, the manufacturers take care to kill the aurelia, by expoſing it to
the ſun, before the moth comes to perfection. This done, they take off the
floſs, and throw the cones into warm water, ſtirring them till the firſt
thread offers them a clue for winding all off. They generally take eight of 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0824000108:58"/> the ſilken threads together; the cones ſtill kept
under water, till a proper quantity of the ſilk is wound off: however, they
do not take all; for the latter parts grow weak, and are of a bad colour. As to
the paper-like ſubſtance which remains, ſome ſtain it with a variety of
colours, to make artificial flowers; others let it lie in the water, till the
glutinous matter which cements it is all diſſolved: it is then carded like
wool, ſpun with a wheel, and converted into ſilk ſtuffs of an inferior
kind.</p>

               <p>IN the foregoing part we treated of cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars changing into
butterflies; in the preſent will be given the hiſtory of grubs changing
into their correſponding winged animals. Theſe, like the former, undergo
their transformation, and appear as grubs or maggots, as aurelias, and at
laſt as winged inſects. Like the former, they are bred from eggs; they feed
in their reptile ſtate; they continue motionleſs and lifeleſs, as
aurelias; and fly and propagate, when furniſhed with wings. But they differ
in many reſpects: the grub or maggot wants the number of feet which the
caterpillar is ſeen to have; the aurelia is not ſo totally wrapped up, but
that its feet and its wings appear. The perfect animal, when emancipated,
alſo has its wings either caſed, or tranſparent, like gauze; not coloured
with that beautifully painted duſt which adorns the wings of the
butterfly.</p>
               <p>In this claſs of inſects, therefore, we may place a various
tribe, that are firſt laid as eggs, then are excluded as maggots or grubs,
then change <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0824000108:61"/> into aurelias, with their legs and wings not
wrapped up, but appearing; and laſtly, aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wings, in which ſtate
they propagate their kind. Some of theſe have four tranſparent wings, as
bees; ſome have two membranous caſes to their wings, as beetles; and ſome
have but two wings, which are tranſparent, as ants. Here, therefore, we will
place the bee, the waſp, the humble bee, the ichnumon fly, the gnat, the
tipula or longlegs, the bettle, the may-bug, the glow-worm, and the ant. The
transformations which all theſe undergo, are pretty nearly ſimilar; and
though very different animals in form, are yet produced nearly in the ſame
manner.</p>

               <p>TO give a complete hiſtory of this inſect in a few pages,
which ſome have exhauſted vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes in deſcribing, and whoſe nature and
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties ſtill continue in diſpute, is impoſſible. It will be
ſufficient to give a general idea of the animal's operations; which, though
they have been ſtudied for more than two thouſand years, are ſtill but
incompletely known. The account given us by Reaumur is ſufficiently minute;
and, if true, ſufficiently wonderful: but I find many of the facts which he
relates, doubted by thoſe who are moſt converſant with bees; and ſome
of them actually declared not to have a real exiſtence in nature.</p>
               <p>It is unhappy, therefore, for thoſe whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod demands an

thoſe particulars in which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding obſervers have begun to think him
er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. Which of the two are right, time only can diſcover; for my part I
have only heard one ſide, for as yet none have been ſo bold as openly to
oppoſe Reaumur's delightful reſearches.</p>
               <p>There are three different kinds of bees in every hive. Firſt,
the labouring bees, which make up the far greateſt number, and are thought to
be neither male or female, but merely born for the purpoſes of labour, and
continuing the breed, by ſupplying the young with proviſion, while yet in
their helpleſs ſtate. The ſecond ſort are the drones; they are of a
darker colour, longer, and more thick by one third than the former: they are
ſuppoſed to be the males; and there is not above a hundred of them, in a
hive of ſeven or eight thouſand bees. The third ſort is much larger than
either of the former, and ſtill fewer in number: ſome aſſert, that
there is not above one in every ſwarm; but this later obſervers affirm not
to be true, there being ſometimes five or ſix in the ſame hive. Theſe
are called queen bees, and are ſaid to lay all the eggs from which the whole
ſwarm is hatched in a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>In examining the ſtructure of the common working bee, the
firſt remarkable part that <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0824000108:64"/> offers is the trunk, which
ſerves to extract the honey from flowers. It is not formed, like that of
other flies, in the manner of a tube, by which the fluid is to be ſucked up;
but like a beſom, to ſweep, or a tongue, to lick it away. The animal is
furniſhed alſo with teeth, which ſerve it in making wax. This
ſubſtance is gathered from flowers, like honey; it conſiſts of that
duſt or farina which contribute to the fecundation of plants, and is molded
into wax by the little animal, at leiſure. Every bee, when it leaves the hive
to collect this precious ſtore, enters into the cup of the flower,
particularly ſuch as ſeem charged with the greateſt quantities of this
yellow farina. As the animal's body is covered over with hair, it rolls
itſelf within the flower, and ſoon becomes quite covered with the duſt,
which it ſoon after bruſhes off with its two hind legs, and kneads into two
little balls. In the thighs of the hind legs there are two cavities, edged with
hair; and into theſe, as into a baſket, the animal ſticks its pellets.
Thus employed, the bee flies from flower to flower, encreaſing its ſtore,
and adding to its ſtock of wax; until the ball, upon each thigh, becomes as
big as a grain of pepper: by this time, having got a ſufficient load, it
returns, making the beſt of its way to the hive.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0824000108:65"/>The belly of the bee is divided into ſix
rings, which ſometime ſhorten the body, by ſlipping one over the other.
It contains within it, beſide the inteſtines, the honey-bag, the venom-bag,
and the ſting. The honey-bag is as tranſparent as chryſtal, containing
the honey that the bee has bruſhed from the flowers; of which the greater
part is carried to the hive, and poured into the cells of the honey-comb; while
the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder ſerves for the bee's own nouriſhment: for, during ſummer,
it never touches what has been laid up for the winter. The ſting, which
ſerves to defend this little animal from its enemies, is compoſed of three
parts; the ſheath, and two darts, which are extremely ſmall and
penetrating. Both the darts have ſeveral ſmall points or barbs, like
thoſe of a fiſh-hook, which renders the ſting more painful, and makes the
darts rankle in the wound. Still, however, this inſtrument would be very
ſlight, did not the bee poiſon the wound. The ſheath, which has a ſharp
point, makes the firſt impreſſion; which is followed by that of the
darts, and then the venomous liquor is poured in. The ſheath ſometimes
ſticks ſo faſt in the wound, that the animal is obliged to leave it
behind; by which the bee ſoon after dies, and the wound is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
enflamed. It might at firſt appear <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0824000108:66"/> well for mankind, if
the bee were without its ſting; but, upon recollection, it will be found,
that the little animal would then have too many rivals in ſharing its
labours. An hundred other lazy animals, fond of honey, and hating la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
would intrude upon the ſweets of the hive; and the treaſure would be
carried off, for want of armed guardians to protect it.</p>
               <p>From examining the bee ſingly, we now come to conſider it in
ſociety, as an animal not only ſubject to laws, but active, vigilant,
laborious, and diſintereſted. All its proviſions are laid up for the
community; and all its arts in building a cell, deſigned for the benefit of
poſterity. The ſubſtance with which bees build their cells is wax; which
is faſhioned into convenient apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for themſelves and their young.
When they begin to work in their hives, they divide themſelves into four
companies: one of which roves in the fields in ſearch of materials; another
employs itſelf in laying out the bottom and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of their cells; a
third is employed in making the inſide ſmooth from the corners and angles;
and the fourth company bring food for the reſt, or relieve thoſe who return
with their reſpective burthens. But they are not kept conſtant to one
employment; they often change the taſks aſſigned them: thoſe that have
been <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0824000108:67"/> at work, being permitted to go abroad; and thoſe
that have been in the fields already, take their places. They ſeem even to
have ſigns, by which they underſtand each other; for when any of them want
food, it bends down its trunk to the bee from whom it is expected, which then
opens its honey-bag, and lets ſome drops fall into the other's mouth, which
is at that time opened to receive it. Their diligence and labour is ſo great,
that, in a day's time, they are able to make cells, which lie upon each other
numerous enough to contain three thouſand bees.</p>
               <p>If we examine their cells, they will be found formed in the
exacteſt proportion. It was ſaid by Pappus, an ancient geometrician, that,
of all other figures, hexagons were the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; for, when placed
touching each other, the moſt convenient room would be given, and the
ſmalleſt loſt. The cells of the bees are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hexagons: theſe, in
every honeycomb, are double, opening on either ſide, and cloſed at the
bottom. The bottoms are compoſed of little triangular panes, which, when
united together, terminate in a point, and lie exactly upon the extremities of
other panes of the ſame ſhape, in oppoſite cells. Theſe lodgings have
ſpaces, like ſtreets, between them, large enough to give the 
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0824000108:68"/> bees a free paſſage in and out; and yet narrow enough
to preſerve the neceſſary heat. The mouth of every cell is defended by a
border, which makes the door a little leſs than the inſide of the cell,
which ſerves to ſtrengthen the whole. Theſe cells ſerve for different
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: for laying up their young; for their wax, which in winter becomes
a part of their food; and for their honey, which makes their principal
ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>It is well known that the habitation of bees ought to be very
cloſe; and what their hives want, from the negligence or unſkilfulneſs of
man, theſe animals ſupply by their own induſtry: ſo that it is their
principal care, when firſt hived, to ſtop up all the crannies. For this
purpoſe they make uſe of a reſinous gum, which is more tenacious than
wax, and differs greatly from it. This the ancients called Propolis: it will
grow conſiderably hard in June; though it will in ſome meaſure ſoften
by heat; and is often found different in conſiſtence, colour and ſmell.
It has generally an agreeable aromatic odour when it is warmed; and by ſome
it is conſidered as a moſt grateful perfume. When the bees begin to work
with it, it is ſoft, but it acquires a firmer conſiſtence every day; till
at length it aſſumes a brown colour, and becomes much <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0824000108:69"/>
harder than wax. The bees carry it on their hinder legs; and ſome think it is
met with on the birch, the willow, and poplar. However it is procured, it is
certain that they plaiſter the inſide of their hives with this
compoſition.</p>
               <p>If examined through a glaſs hive, from the hurry the whole
ſwarm is in, the whole at firſt appears like anarchy and confuſion: but
the ſpectator ſoon finds every animal diligently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and following
one purſuit, with a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled purpoſe. Their teeth are the inſtruments
by which they model and faſhion their various buildings, and give them ſuch
ſymmetry and perfection. They begin at the top of the hive; and ſeveral of
them work at a time, at the cells which have two faces. If they are ſtinted
with regard to time, they give the new cells but half the depth which they
ought to have; leaving them imperfect, till they have ſketched out the number
of cells neceſſary for the preſent occaſion. The conſtruction of
their combs, coſts them a great deal of labour: they are made by
inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible additions; and not caſt at once in a mold, as ſome are apt
to imagine. There ſeems no end of their ſhaping, finiſhing, and turning
them neatly up. The cells for their young are moſt carefully formed; thoſe
deſigned for lodging the drones, are larger than the reſt; 
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0824000108:70"/> and that for the queen-bee, the largeſt of all. The
cells in which the young brood are lodged, ſerve at different times for
containing honey; and this proceeds from an obvious cauſe: every worm, before
it is transformed into an aurelia, hangs its old ſkin on the partitions of
its cell; and thus, while it ſtrengthens the wall, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the capacity
of its late apartment. The ſame cell, in a ſingle ſummer, is often
tenanted by three or four worms in ſucceſſion; and the next ſeaſon,
by three or four more. Each worm takes particular care to fortify the pannels
of its cell, by hanging up its ſpoils there: thus, the partitions being
lined, ſix or eight deep, become at laſt too narrow for a new brood, and
are converted into ſtore-houſes, for honey.</p>
               <p>Thoſe cells where nothing but honey is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, are much
deeper than the reſt. When the harveſt of honey is ſo plentiful that they
have not ſufficient room for it, they either lengthen their combs, or build
more; which are much longer than the former. Sometimes they work at three combs
at a time; for, when there are three work-houſes, more bees may be thus
employed, without embarraſſing each other.</p>
               <p>But honey, as was before obſerved, is not the only food upon
which theſe animals ſubſiſt. <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0824000108:71"/> The meal of flowers,
of which their wax is formed, is one of their moſt favourite repaſts. This
is a diet which they live upon during the ſummer; and of which they lay up a
large winter proviſion. The wax of which their combs are made, is no more
than this meal digeſted, and wrought into a paſte. When the flowers upon
which bees generally feed, are not fully blown, and this meal or duſt is not
offered in ſufficient quantities, the bees pinch the tops of the ſtamina in
which it is contained, with their teeth; and thus anticipate the progreſs of
vegetation. In April and May, the bees are buſy, from morning to evening, in
gathering this meal; but when the weather becomes too hot in the midſt of
ſummer, they work only in the morning.</p>
               <p>The bee is furniſhed with a ſtomach for its wax, as well as
its honey. In the former of the two, their powder is altered, digeſted and
concocted into real wax; and is thus ejected by the ſame paſſage by which
it was ſwallowed. Every comb, newly made, is white: but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes yellow as
it grows old, and almoſt black when kept too long in the hive. Beſide the
wax thus digeſted, there is a large portion of the powder kneaded up for food
in every hive, and kept in ſeparate cells, for winter proviſion. 
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0824000108:72"/> This is called, by the country people, bee-bread; and
contributes to the health and ſtrength of the animal during winter. Thoſe
who rear bees, may rob them of their honey, and feed them, during the winter,
with treacle; but no proper ſubſtitute has yet been found for the
bee-bread; and, without it, the animals become conſumptive and die.</p>
               <p>As for the honey, it is extracted from that part of the flower
called the nectareum. From the mouth this delicious fluid paſſes into the
gullet; and then into the firſt ſtomach, or honey-bag, which, when filled,
appears like an oblong bladder. Children, that live in country places, are well
acquainted with this bladder; and deſtroy many bees to come at their ſtore
of honey. When a bee has ſufficiently filled its firſt ſtomach, it
returns back to the hive, where it diſgorges the honey into one of the cells.
It often happens that the bee delivers its ſtore to ſome other, at the
mouth of the hive, and flies off for a freſh ſupply. Some honey-combs are
always left open for common uſe; but many others are ſtopped up, till there
is a neceſſity of opening them. Each of theſe are covered care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with
wax; ſo cloſe, that the covers ſeem to be made at the very inſtant the
fluid is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited within them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0824000108:73"/>Having thus given a curſory deſcription
of the inſect, individually conſidered, and of the habitation it forms, we
next come to its ſocial habits and inſtitutions: and, in conſidering this
little animal attentively, after the neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions for the
immediate preſervation of the community, its ſecond care is turned to the
continuance of poſterity. How numerous ſoever the multitude of bees may
appear in one ſwarm, yet they all owe their original to a ſingle parent,
which is called the queen-bee. It is indeed ſurprizing that a ſingle
inſect ſhall, in one ſummer, give birth to above twenty thouſand young:
but, upon opening her body, the wonder will ceaſe; as the number of eggs
appearing, at one time, amounts to five thouſand. This animal, whoſe
exiſtence is of ſuch importance to her ſubjects, may eaſily be
diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, by her ſize, and the ſhape of her body.
On her ſafety depends the whole wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the commonwealth; and the
attentions paid her by all the reſt of the ſwarm, evidently ſhew the
dependence her ſubjects have upon her ſecurity. If this inſect be
carefully obſerved, ſhe will be ſeen at times attended with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
retinue, marching from cell to cell, plunging the extremity of her body into
many of them, and leaving a ſmall egg in each.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0824000108:74"/>The bees which generally compoſe her
train, are thought to be males, which ſerve to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate her by turns.
Theſe are larger and blacker than the common bees; without ſtings, and
without induſtry. They ſeem formed only to tranſmit a poſterity; and to
attend the queen, whenever ſhe thinks proper to iſſue from the ſecret
retreats of the hive, where ſhe moſt uſually reſides. Upon the union of
theſe two kinds depends all expectations of a future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny; for the
working bees are of no ſex, and only labour for another offspring: yet ſuch
is their attention to their queen, that if ſhe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to die, they will
leave off working, and take no farther care of poſterity. If, however,
another queen is in this ſtate of univerſal deſpair preſented them,
they immediately acknowledge her for ſovereign, and once more diligently
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to their labour. It muſt be obſerved, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that all this
fertility of the queen-bee, and the great attentions paid to her by the reſt,
are controverted by more recent obſervers. They aſſert, that the common
bees are parents themſelves; that they depoſite their eggs in the cells
which they have prepared; that the females are impregnated by the males, and
bring forth a progeny, which is wholly their own.</p>
               <p>However, to go on with their hiſtory, as <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0824000108:75"/>
delivered us by Mr. Reaumur—When the queen-bee has depoſited the number
of eggs neceſſary in the cells, the working bees under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the care of the
riſing poſterity. They are ſeen to leave off their uſual employments;
to conſtruct proper receptacles for eggs; or to complete thoſe that are
already formed. They purpoſely build little cells, extremely ſolid, for the
young; in which they employ a great deal of wax: thoſe deſigned for lodging
the males, as was already obſerved, are larger than the reſt; and thoſe
for the queen-bees the largeſt of all. There is uſually but one egg
depoſited in every cell; but when the fecundity of the queen is ſuch, that
it exceeds the number of cells already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, there are ſometimes three
or four eggs crowded together in the ſame apartment. But this is an
inconvenience that the working bees will by no means ſuffer. They ſeem
ſenſible that, two young ones, ſtuffed up in the ſame cell, when they
grow larger, will but embarraſs, and at laſt deſtroy each other: they
therefore take care to leave a cell to every egg; and remove, or deſtroy the
reſt.</p>
               <p>The ſingle egg that is left remaining, is fixed to the bottom
of the cell, and touches it but in a ſingle point. A day or two after it is
depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, the worm is excluded from the ſhell of <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0824000108:76"/> the
egg, having the appearance of a maggot rolled up in a ring, and lying ſoftly
on a bed of a whitiſh coloured jelly; upon which alſo the little animal
begins to feed. In the mean time, the inſtant it appears, the working bees
attend it with the moſt anxious and parental tenderneſs; they furniſh it
every hour with a ſupply of this whitiſh ſubſtance, on which it feeds
and lies; and watch the cell with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting care. They are nurſes that
have a greater affection for the offspring of others, than many parents have
for their own children. They are conſtant in viſiting each cell, and
ſeeing that nothing is wanting; preparing the white mixture, which is nothing
but a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of honey and wax, in their own bowels, with which they
feed them. Thus attended, and plentifully fed, the worm, in leſs than ſix
days time, comes to its full growth, and no longer accepts the food offered it.
When the bees perceive that it has no further occaſion for feeding, they
perform the laſt offices of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and ſhut the little animal up in
its cell; walling up the mouth of its apartment with wax: there they leave the
worm to itſelf; having ſecured it from every external injury.</p>
               <p>The worm is no ſooner left encloſed, but, from a ſtate of
inaction, it begins to labour, <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0824000108:77"/> extending and ſhortening
its body; and by this means lining the walls of its apartment with a ſilken
tapeſtry, which it ſpins in the manner of caterpillars, before they undergo
their laſt transformation. When their cell is thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, the animal is
ſoon after transformed into an aurelia; but differing from that of the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caterpillar, as it exhibits not only the legs, but the wings of the
future bee, in its preſent ſtate of inactivity. Thus, in about twenty, or
one and twenty days after the egg was laid, the bee is completely formed, and
fitted to undergo the fatigues of its ſtate. When all its parts have acquired
their proper ſtrength and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, the young animal opens its
priſon, by piercing with its teeth the waxen door that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines it. When
juſt freed from its cell, it is as yet moiſt, and incommoded with the
ſpoils of its former ſituation; but the officious bees are ſoon ſeen to
flock round it, and to lick it clean on all ſides with their trunks; while
another band, with equal aſſiduity, are obſerved to feed it with honey:
others again begin immediately to cleanſe the cell that has been juſt left;
to carry the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures out of the hive, and to fit the place for a new
inhabitant. The young bee ſoon repays their care, by its induſtry; for as
ſoon as ever its external parts become dry, it diſcovers its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural 
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0824000108:78"/> appetites for labour, and induſtriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the
taſk, which it purſues unremittingly through life. The toil of man is
irkſome to him, and he earns his ſubſiſtance with pain; but this little
animal ſeems happy in its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and finds delight in all its
employments.</p>
               <p>When juſt freed from the cell, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly equipped by its
fellow bees for duty, it at once iſſues from the hive, and inſtructed
only by nature, goes in queſt of flowers, chuſes only thoſe that yield it
a ſupply, rejects ſuch as are barren of honey, or have been already drained
by other adventurers; and when load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is never at a loſs to find its way
back to the common habitation. After this firſt ſally, it begins to gather
the mealy powder, that lies on every flower, which is afterwards converted into
wax; and with this, the very firſt day, it returns with two large balls
ſtuck to its thighs.</p>
               <p>When bees firſt begin to break their priſons, there are
generally above a hundred excluded in one day. Thus, in the ſpace of a few
weeks, the number of the inhabitants in one hive, of moderate ſize, becomes
ſo great, that there is no place to contain the new comers; and they are
ſcarcely excluded from the cell, when they are obliged, by the old bees, to
ſally forth in queſt of new habitations. In other words, the 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0824000108:79"/> hive begins to ſwarm, and the new progeny prepares for
exile.</p>
               <p>While there is room enough in the hive, the bees remain quietly
together; it is neceſſity alone that compels the ſeparation. Sometimes,
indeed, the young brood, with graceleſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, refuſe to depart, and
even venture to reſiſt their progenitors. The young ones are known by being
browner than the old, with whiter hair; the old ones are of a lighter co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
with red hair. The two armies are therefore eaſily diſtinguiſhable, and
dreadful battles are often ſeen to enſue. But the victory almoſt ever
terminates with ſtrict poetical juſtice in favour of the veterans, and the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious offspring are driven off, not without loſs and mutilation.</p>
               <p>In different countries, the ſwarms make their appearance at
different times of the year, and there are ſeveral ſigns previous to this
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended migration. The night before, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual buzzing is heard in the
hive; in the morning, though the weather be ſoft and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting, they ſeem
not to obey the call, being intent on more important meditations within. All
labour is diſcontinued in the hive, every bee is either employed in forcing,
or reluctant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielding a ſubmiſſion; at length, after ſome 
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0824000108:80"/> noiſe and tumult, a queen bee is choſen, to guard,
rather than conduct, the young colony to other habitations, and then they are
marſhalled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apparent conductor. In leſs than a minute, they
leave their native abode, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cloud round their protectreſs, they
ſet off, without ſeeming to know the place of their deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; 
<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>The world before them, where to chuſe
their place of reſt.</hi>
                  </q> The uſual time of ſwarming, is from ten in
the morning, to three in the afternoon, when the ſun ſhines bright, and
invites them to ſeek their fortunes. They flutter for a while, in the air,
like flakes of ſnow, and ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a diſtant journey, but more
frequently are contented with ſome neighbouring aſylum; the branch of a
tree, a chimney top, or ſome other expoſed ſituation. It is, indeed,
remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that all thoſe animals, of what ever kind, that have long been
under the protection of man, ſeem to loſe a part of their natural
ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, in providing for themſelves. The rabbit, when domeſticated,
forgets to dig holes, the hen to build a neſt, and the bee to ſeek a
ſhelter, that ſhall protect it from the inclemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of winter. In thoſe
countries, where the bees are wild, and unprotected by man, they are always
ſure to build their waxen cells in the hollow of a tree; but with us, they
ſeem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0824000108:81"/> provident in their choice, and the
firſt green branch that ſtops their flight, ſeems to be thought
ſufficient for their abode through win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. However, it does not appear, that
the queen chuſes the place where they are to alight, for many of the
ſtragglers, who ſeem to be pleaſed with a particular branch, go and
ſettle upon it; others are ſeen to ſucceed, and at laſt, the queen
herſelf, when ſhe finds a ſufficient number there before her, goes to
make it the place of her head quarters. When the queen is ſettled, the reſt
of the ſwarm ſoon follow; and, in about a quarter of an hour, the whole
body ſeem to be at eaſe. It ſometimes is found, that there are two or
three queens to a ſwarm, and the colony is divided into parties; but it
moſt uſually happens, that one of theſe is more conſiderable than the
other, and the bees by degrees, deſert the weakeſt, to take ſhelter under
the moſt powerful protector. The deſerted queen does not long ſurvive
this defeat; ſhe takes refuge under the new monarch, and is ſoon
deſtroyed by her jealous rival. Till this cruel execution is performed, the
bees never go out to work; and if there ſhould be a queen bee, belonging to
the new colony, left in the old hive, ſhe always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes the fate of the
former. However, it muſt <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0824000108:82"/> be obſerved, that the bees
never ſacrifice any of their queens, when the hive is full of wax and honey;
for there is at that time, no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in maintaining a plurality of
breeders.</p>
               <p>When the ſwarm is thus conducted to a place of reſt, and the
policy of government is ſettled, the bees ſoon reſume their former
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. The making cells, ſtoring them with honey, impregnating the queen,
making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cells for the reception of the riſing progeny, and protecting
them from external danger, employ their unceaſing induſtry. But ſoon
after, and towards the latter end of ſummer, when the colony is
ſufficiently ſtored with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, a moſt cruel policy enſues. The
drone bees, which are (as has been ſaid) ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in a hive, to the number
of an hundred, are marked for ſlaughter. Theſe, which had hitherto led a
life of indolence and pleaſure, whoſe only employment was in impregnating
the queen, and rioting upon the labours of the hive, without aiding in the
general toil, now ſhare the fate of moſt voluptuaries, and fall a
ſacrifice to the general reſentment of ſociety.</p>
               <p>The working bees, in a body, declare war againſt them; and in
two or three days time, the ground all round the hive is covered with their
dead bodies. Nay, the working bees <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0824000108:83"/> will even kill ſuch
drones, as are yet in the worm ſtate, in the cell, and eject their bodies
from the hive, among the general carnage.</p>
               <p>When a hive ſends out ſeveral ſwarms in the year, the
firſt is always the beſt, and the moſt numerous. Theſe, having the
whole ſummer before them, have the more time for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wax and honey, and
conſequently their labours are the moſt valuable to the proprietor.
Although the ſwarm chiefly conſiſts of the youngeſt bees, yet it is
often found, that bees of all ages compoſe the multitude of emigrants, and it
often happens, that bees of all ages are ſeen remaining behind. The number of
them is always more conſiderable than that of ſome populous cities, for
ſometimes upwards of forty thouſand are found in a ſingle hive. So large
a body may well be ſuppoſed to work with great expedition; and in fact, in
leſs than twenty-four hours, they will make combs above twenty inches long,
and ſeven or eight broad. Sometimes they will half fill their hives with wax,
in leſs than five days. In the firſt fifteen days, they are always found to
make more wax than they do afterwards during the reſt of the year.</p>
               <p>Such are the out-lines of the natural hiſtory of theſe
annimals, as uſually found in our own <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0824000108:84"/> country. How they
are treated, ſo as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the greateſt quantity of honey, belongs
rather to the rural oeconomiſt, than the natural hiſtorian; volumes have
been written on the ſubject, and ſtill more remains equally curious and
new. One thing, however, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to obſerve, that a farm, or a
country, may be over ſtocked with bees, as with any other ſort of animal;
for a certain number of hives, always require a certain number of flowers to
ſubſiſt on. When the flowers near home are rifled, then are theſe
induſtrious inſects ſeen tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more extenſive ranges, but their
abilities may be over taxed; and if they are obliged, in queſt of honey, to
go too far from home, they are over-wearied in the purſuit, they are
devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by birds, or beat down by the winds and rain.</p>
               <p>For a knowledge of this, in ſome parts of France and Piedmont,
they have contrived, as I have often ſeen, a kind of floating
bee-houſe.</p>
               <p>They have on board one barge, threeſcore or an hundred
bee-hives, well defended from the inclemency of an accidental ſtorm; and with
theſe, the owners ſuffer themſelves to float gently down the river. As
the bees are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually chuſing their flowery paſture along the banks of
the ſtream, they are furniſhed with ſweets before unrifled; and thus a
ſingle float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0824000108:85"/> bee-houſe, yields the proprietor a
conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able income. Why a method ſimilar to this has never been adopted
in England, where we have more gentle rivers, and more flowery banks, than in
any other part of the world, I know not; certainly it might be turned to
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and yield the poſſeſſor a ſecure, though perhaps a
moderate income.</p>
               <p>Having mentioned the induſtry of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable inſects,
it will be proper to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the effects of their labour, of that
wax and honey, which are turned by man to ſuch various uſes. Bees gather
two kinds of wax, one coarſe and the other fine. The coarſer ſort is
bitter, and with this, which is called <hi>propolis,</hi> they ſtop up all
the holes and crevices of their hives. It is of a more reſinous nature than
the fine wax, and is conſequently better qualified to reſiſt the
moiſture of the ſeaſon, and preſerve the works warm and dry within. The
fine wax is as neceſſary to the animals preſervation as the honey
itſelf. With this they make their lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with this they cover the cells
of their young, and in this they lay up their magazines of honey. This is made,
as has been already obſerved, from the duſt of flowers, which is carefully
kneaded by the little inſect, then ſwallowed, and having undergone a kind
of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0824000108:86"/> is formed into the cells, which anſwers
ſuch a variety of purpoſes. To collect this, the animal rolls itſelf in
the flower it would rob, and thus takes up the vegetable duſt with the hair
of its body. Then carefully bruſhing it into a lump, with its fore paws it
thruſts the compoſition into two cavities behind the thighs, which are made
like ſpoons to receive the wax, and the hair that lines them, ſerves to
keep it from falling.</p>
               <p>As of wax, there are alſo two kinds of honey. The white and
the yellow. The white is taken without fire from the honey-combs. The yellow is
extracted by heat, and ſqueezed through bags, in a preſs. The beſt honey
is new, thick and granulated, of a clear tranſparent white colour, of a
ſoft and aromatic ſmell, and of a ſweet lively taſte. Honey made in
moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous countries, is preferable to that of the valley. The honey made in
the ſpring, is more highly eſteemed, than that gathered in ſummer, which
laſt is ſtill more valuable, than that of autumn, when the flowers begin to
fade and loſe their fragrance.</p>
               <p>The bees are nearly alike in all parts of the world, yet there
are differences worthy our notice. In Guadaloupe, the bee is leſs by one
half, than the European, and more black and <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0824000108:87"/> round. They
have no ſting, and make their cells in hollow trees; where, if the hole they
meet with is too large, they form a ſort of waxen houſe, of the ſhape of
a pear, and in this they lodge and ſtore their honey, and lay their eggs.
They lay up their honey in waxen veſſels, of the ſize of a pigeon's egg,
of a black or deep violet colour; and theſe are ſo joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that
there is no ſpace left between them. The honey never congeals, but is fluid,
of the conſiſtence of oil, and the colour of amber. Reſembling theſe,
there are found little black bees, without a ſting, in all the tropical
cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates; and though theſe countries are replete with bees, like our own,
yet thoſe form the moſt uſeful and laborious tribe in that part of the
world. The honey they produce, is neither ſo unpalatable, nor ſo
ſurfeiting as ours; and the wax is ſo ſoft, that it is only uſed for
medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal purpoſes, it being never found hard enough to form into candles,
as in Europe.</p>
               <p>Of inſects, that receive the name of bees, among us, there are
ſeveral; which, however, differ very widely from that induſtrious ſocial
race we have been juſt deſcribing. The HUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE BEE is the largeſt of all
this tribe, being as large as the firſt joint of one's middle finger. Theſe
are ſeen in every field, and perched on <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0824000108:88"/> every flower.
They build their neſt in holes in the ground, of dry leaves, mixed with wax
and wool, defended with moſs from the weather. Each humble bee makes a
ſeparate cell about the ſize of a ſmall nutmeg, which is round and
hollow, containing the honey in a bag. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of theſe cells are joined
together, in ſuch a manner, that the whole appears like a cluſter of
grapes. The females, which have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of waſps, are very few, and
their eggs are laid in cells, which the reſt ſoon cover over with wax. It
is uncertain whether they have a queen or not; but there is one much larger
than the reſt, without wings, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hair, and all over black, like
poliſhed ebony. This goes and views all the works, from time to time, and
enters into the cell, as if it wanted to ſee whether every thing was done
right: In the morning, the young humble bees are very idle, and ſeem not at
all inclined to labour, till one of the largeſt, about ſeven o'clock,
thruſts half its body from a hole, deſigned for that purpoſe, and
ſeated on the top of the neſt, beats its wings for twenty minutes
ſucceſſively, buzzing the whole time, till the whole colony is put in
motion. The humble bees gather honey, as well as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon 
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0824000108:89"/> bees; but it is neither ſo fine, nor ſo good, nor the
wax ſo clean, or ſo capable of fuſion.</p>
               <p>Beſides the bees already mentioned, there are various kinds
among us, that have much the appearance of honey-makers, and yet make only wax.
The WOOD BEE is ſeen in every garden. It is rather larger than the common
queen bee; its body of a blueiſh black, which is ſmooth and ſhining. It
begins to appear at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of ſpring, and is ſeen flying near walls
expoſed to a ſunny aſpect. This bee makes its neſt in ſome piece of
wood, which it contrives to ſcoop and hollow for its purpoſe. This,
however, is never done in trees that are ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the wood it makes
choice of is half rotten. The holes are not made directly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but turning
to one ſide, and have an opening ſufficient to admit one's middle finger;
from whence runs the inner apartment, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally twelve or fifteen inches long.
The inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed in boring theſe cavities, are their teeth; the
cavity is uſually branched into three or four apartments; and in each of
theſe, they lay their eggs, to the number of ten or twelve, each ſeparate
and diſtinct from the reſt: The egg is involved in a ſort of paſte,
which ſerves at once for the young animal's protection <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0824000108:90"/>
and nouriſhment. The grown bees, however, feed upon ſmall inſects,
particularly a louſe, of a reddiſh brown colour, of the ſize of a ſmall
pin's head.</p>
               <p>MASON BEES make their cells with a ſort of mortar, made of
earth, which they build againſt a wall that is expoſed to the ſun. The
mortar, which at firſt is ſoft, ſoon becomes as hard as ſtone, and in
this their eggs are laid. Each neſt contains ſeven or eight cells, an egg
in every cell, placed regularly one over the other. If the neſt remains
unhurt, or wants but little repairs, they make uſe of them the year
enſuing: and thus they often ſerve three or four years ſucceſſively.
From the ſtrength of their houſes, one would think theſe bees in perfect
ſecurity, yet none are more expoſed than they. A worm with very ſtrong
teeth, is often found to bore into their little fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and devour
their young.</p>
               <p>The GROUND BEE builds its neſt in the earth, wherein they make
round holes, five or ſix inches deep; the mouth being narrow, and only juſt
ſufficient to admit the little inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. It is amuſing enough, to
obſerve the patience and aſſiduity with which they labour. They carry out
all the earth, grain by grain, to the mouth of the hole, where it forms a
little <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0824000108:91"/> hillock, an Alps compared to the power of the
artiſt by which it is raiſed. Sometimes the walks of a garden are found
undermined by their labours; ſome of the holes running directly downward,
others horizontally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſurface. They lay up in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
proviſions for their young, which conſiſt of a paſte that has the
appearance of corn, and is of a ſweetiſh taſte.</p>
               <p>The LEAF-CUTTING BEES make their neſt and lay their eggs among
bits of leaves, very artificially placed in holes in the earth, of about the
length of a tooth-pick caſe. They make the bits of leaves of a roundiſh
form, and with them line the inſide of their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This tapeſtry is
ſtill further lined by a reddiſh kind of paſte, ſomewhat ſweet or
acid. Theſe bees are of various kinds; thoſe that build their neſts with
cheſnut-leaves are as big as drones, but thoſe of the roſe-tree are
ſmaller than the common bee.</p>
               <p>The WALL BEES are ſo called, becauſe they make their neſts
in walls of a kind of ſilky membrane with which they fill up the vacuities
between the ſmall ſtones which form the ſides of their habitation. Their
apartment conſiſts of ſeveral cells placed end to end, each in the
ſhape of a woman's thimble. Though the <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0824000108:92"/> web which lines
this habitation is thick and warm, yet it is tranſparent and of a whitiſh
colour. This ſubſtance is ſuppoſed to be ſpun from the animal's body;
the male and females are of a ſize, but the former are without a ſting. To
theſe varieties of the bee kind might be added ſeveral others which are all
different in nature, but not ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed to excite
curioſity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the Waſp and Hornet.</head>
               <p>HOWEVER ſimilar many inſects may be in appearance, this does
not imply a ſimilitude in their hiſtory. The bee and the waſp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
each other very ſtrongly, yet, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining their manner and their duration,
they differ very widely; the bee labours to lay up honey, and lives to enjoy
the fruits of its indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; the waſp appears equally aſſiduous, but
only works for poſterity, as the habitation is ſcarcely completed when the
inhabitant dies.</p>
               <p>The waſp is well known to be a winged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect with a
ſting. To be longer in proportion to its bulk than the bee, to be marked with
bright yellow circles round its body, and to be the moſt ſwift and active
inſect of all the fly kind. On each ſide of the mouth this animal is
furniſhed with a long tooth, notched like a ſaw, and with theſe it is
enabled to cut any ſubſtance, not omitting meat itſelf, and to carry it
to its neſt. Waſps live like bees in community, and ſometimes ten or
twelve thouſand are found inhabiting a ſingle neſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0824000108:94"/>Of all other inſects the waſp is the
moſt fierce, voracious, and moſt dangerous, when enraged. They are ſeen
wherever fleſh is cutting up, gorging themſelves with the ſpoil, and then
flying to their neſts with their reeking prey. They make war alſo on every
other fly, and the ſpider himſelf dreads their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
               <p>Every community among bees is compoſed of females or queens,
drones or males, and neutral or working bees. Waſps have ſimilar
occupations; the two firſt are for propagating the ſpecies, the laſt for
nurſing, defending and ſupporting the riſing progeny. Among bees,
however, there is ſeldom above a queen or two in an hive; among waſps there
are above two or three hundred.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the ſummer begins to invigorate the inſect
tribes, the waſps are the moſt of the number, and diligently employed
either in providing proviſions for their neſt, if already made, or in
making one, if the former habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be too ſmall to receive the
encreaſing community. The neſt is one of the moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious objects in
natural hiſtory, and contrived almoſt as artificially as that of the bees
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Their principal care is to ſeek out an hole that has been
begun by ſome other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0824000108:95"/> a field mouſe, a rat, or
a mole, to build their neſts in. They ſometimes build upon the plain, where
they are ſure of the dryneſs of their ſituation, but moſt commonly on
the ſide of a bank to avoid the rain or water that would otherwiſe annoy
them. When they have choſen a proper place they go to work with wonderful
aſſiduity. Their firſt labour is to enlarge and widen the hole, taking
away the earth and carrying it off to ſome diſtance. They are perfectly
formed for labour, being furniſhed with a trunk above their mouths, two
ſaws on each ſide which play to the right and left againſt each other,
and ſix ſtrong muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar legs to ſupport them. They cut the earth into
ſmall parcels with their ſaws, and carry it out with their legs or paws.
This is the work of ſome days; and at length the outline of their habitation
is formed, making a cavity of about a foot and an half every way. While ſome
are working in this manner, others are roving the fields to ſeek out
materials for their building. To prevent the earth from falling down and
cruſhing their riſing city into ruin, they make a ſort of roof with their
gluey ſubſtance, to which they begin to fix the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of their
building, working from the top downwards, as if they were hanging a 
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0824000108:96"/> bell, which, however at length they cloſe up at the
bottom. The materials with which they build their neſts are bits of wood and
glue. The wood they get where they can from the rails and poſts which they
meet with in the fields and elſewhere. Theſe they ſaw and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into a
multitude of ſmall fibres, of which they take up little bundles in their
claws, letting fall upon them a few drops of gluey matter with which their
bodies are provided, by the help of which they knead the whole compoſition
into a paſte, which ſerves them in their future building. When they have
returned with this to the neſt, they ſtick their load of paſte on that
part where they make their walls and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions; they tread it cloſe with
their feet, and trowel it with their trunks, ſtill going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as they
work. Having repeated this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration three or four times, the compoſition is
at length flatted out until it becomes a ſmall leaf of a grey colour, much
finer than paper, and of a pretty firm texture. This done the ſame waſp
returns to the field to collect a ſecond load of paſte, repeating the
ſame ſeveral times, placing layer upon layer, and ſtrengthening eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
partition in proportion to the wants or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of the general fabric.
Other work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waſps come quickly after to repeat the ſame 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0824000108:97"/> operation, laying more leaves upon the former, till at
length, after much toil, they have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the large roof which is to
ſecure them from the tumbling in of the earth. This dome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed,
they make another entrance to their habitation, deſigned either for letting
in the warmth of the ſun, or for eſcaping in caſe one door be invaded by
plunderers. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain however it is, that by one of theſe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enter,
by the other they ſally forth to their toil; each hole being ſo ſmall
that they can paſs but one at a time. The walls being thus compoſed, and
the whole ſomewhat of the ſhape of a pear, they labour at their cells,
which they compoſe of the ſame paper-like ſubſtance that goes to the
formation of their outſide works. Their combs differ from thoſe of bees,
not leſs in the compoſition than the poſition which they are always
ſeen to obtain. The honey-comb of the bee is edgeways with reſpect to the
hive; that of the waſp is flat, and the mouth of every cell opens downwards.
Thus is their habitation, contrived ſtory above ſtory, ſupported by
ſeveral rows of pillars which give firmneſs to the whole building, while
the upper ſtory is flat-roofed, and as ſmooth as the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a room,
laid with ſquares of marble. The waſps can freely walk upon theſe
ſtories <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0824000108:98"/> between the pillars to do whatever their wants
require. The pillars are very hard and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, being larger at each end than
in the middle, not much unlike the columns of a building. All the cells of the
neſt are only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined for the reception of the young, being replete with
neither wax nor honey.</p>
               <p>Each cell is like that of the bee, hexagonal; but they are of
two ſorts, the one larger for the production of the male and female waſps,
the other leſs for the reception of the working part of the community. When
the females are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated by the males, they lay their eggs, one in each
cell, and ſtick it in with a kind of gummy matter to prevent its falling out.
From this egg proceeds the inſect in its worm-ſtate, of which the old ones
are extremely careful, feeding it from time to time till it becomes large and
entirely fills up its cell. But the waſp community differs from that of the
bee in this; that among the latter the working bees take the parental duties
upon them, whereas among the waſps the females alone are permitted to feed
their young, and to nurſe their riſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny. For this purpoſe the
female waits with great patience till the working waſps have brought in their
proviſions, which ſhe takes from them, and cuts into pieces. She then goes 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0824000108:99"/> with great compoſure from cell to cell, and feeds every
young one with her mouth. When the young worms have come to a certain ſize
they leave off eating, and begin to ſpin a very fine ſilk, fixing the
firſt end to the entrance of the cell, then turning their heads, firſt on
one ſide, then on the other, they fix the thread to different parts, and thus
they make a ſort of a door which ſerves to cloſe up the mouth of the
cell. After this they diveſt themſelves of their ſkins after the uſual
mode of transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the aurelia by degrees begins to emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate itſelf
from its ſhell; by little and little it thruſts out its legs and wings, and
inſenſibly acquires the colour and ſhape of its parent.</p>
               <p>The waſp thus formed, and prepared for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predation, becomes a
bold, troubleſome, and dangerous inſect: there are no dangers which it will
not encounter in purſuit of its prey, and nothing ſeems to ſatiate its
gluttony. Though it can gather no honey of its own, no animal is more fond of
ſweets. For this purpoſe it will purſue the bee and the humble bee,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them with its ſting, and then plunder them of their honey-bag,
with which it flies triumphantly loaded to its neſt to regale its young.
Waſps are ever fond of making their neſts in the neighbourhood of bees,
merely to <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0824000108:100"/> have an opportunity of robbing their hives,
and feaſting on the ſpoil. Yet the bees are not found always patiently
ſubmiſſive to their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, but fierce battles are ſometimes ſeen
to enſue, in which the bees make up by conduct and numbers what they want in
perſonal prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs. When there is no honey to be had, they ſeek for the
beſt and ſweeteſt fruits, and they are never miſtaken in their choice.
From the garden they fly to the city, to the grocers ſhops, and butchers
ſhambles. They will ſometimes carry off bits of fleſh half as big as
themſelves, with which they fly to their neſts for the nouriſhment of
their brood. Thoſe who cannot drive them away, lay for them a piece of ox's
liver, which being without fibres, they prefer to other fleſh; and whenever
they are found, all other flies are ſeen to deſert the place immediately.
Such is the dread with which theſe little animals impreſs all the reſt of
the inſect tribes, which they ſeize and devour without mercy, that they
vaniſh at their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Wherever they fly, like the eagle or the falcon,
they form a deſert in the air around them. In this manner the ſummer is
paſſed in plundering the neighbourhood, and rearing up their young; every
day adds to their numbers; and from their ſtrength, agility, and
indiſcriminate appetite for every kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0824000108:101"/> were they as long lived as the bee, they would ſoon ſwarm upon
the face of nature, and become the moſt noxious plague of man: but
providentially their lives are meaſured to their miſchief, and they live
but a ſingle ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>While the ſummer heats continue, they are bold, voracious, and
enterprizing; but as the ſun withdraws, it ſeems to rob them of their
courage and activity. In proportion as the cold encreaſes, they are ſeen to
become more do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic; they ſeldom leave the neſt, they make but ſhort
adventures from home, they flutter about in the noon-day heats, and ſoon
after return chilled and feeble.</p>
               <p>As their calamities encreaſe, new paſſions ſoon begin to
take place; the care for poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity no longer continues, and as the parents
are no longer able to provide their grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing progeny a ſupply, they take the
barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſolution of ſacrificing them all to the neceſſity of the
times. In this manner, like a garriſon upon ſhort allowance, all the
uſeleſs hands are deſtroyed; the young worms, which a little before they
fed and protected with ſo much aſſiduity, are now butchered and dragged
fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m their cells. As the cold
encreaſes they no longer find ſufficient warmth in their neſts, which
grow hateful to them, and they fly to <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0824000108:102"/> ſeek it in the
corners of houſes, and places that receive an artificial heat. But the winter
is ſtill inſupportable; and, before the new year begins, they wither and
die; the working bees firſt, the males ſoon following, and many of the
fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males ſuffering in the general calamity. In every neſt, however, one or
two females ſurvive the winter, and having been impregnated by the male
during the preceding ſeaſon, ſhe begins in ſpring to lay her eggs in a
little hole of her own contrivance. This bundle of eggs, which is cluſtered
together like grapes, ſoon produces two worms which the female takes proper
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution to defend and ſupply, and theſe when hatched ſoon give
aſſiſtance to the female, who is employed in hatching two more; theſe
alſo gathering ſtrength, extricate themſelves out of the web that
encloſed them, and become likewiſe aſſiſtants to their mother;
fifteen days after, two more make their appearance; thus is the community every
day encreaſing, while the female lays in every cell, firſt a male and then
a female. Theſe ſoon after become breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in turn, till, from a ſingle
female, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand waſps are ſeen produced before the month of June.
After the female has thus produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her progeny, which are diſtributed in
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſtricts, they aſſemble from all parts, <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0824000108:103"/> in the middle of ſummer, and provide for themſelves the large
and commodious habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which has been deſcribed above.</p>
               <p>Such is the hiſtory of the ſocial waſp; but, as among
bees, ſo alſo among theſe inſects, there are various tribes that live
in ſolitude: theſe lay their eggs in a hole for the purpoſe, and the
parent dies long before the birth of its offspring. In the principal ſpecies
of the SOLITARY WASPS, the inſect is ſmaller than the working waſp of the
ſocial kind. The fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which the corſelet is joined to the body, is
longer and more diſtinctly ſeen, and the whole colour of the inſect is
blacker than in the ordinary kinds. But it is not their figure, but the manners
of this extraordinary inſect that claim our principal regard.</p>
               <p>From the end of May to the beginning of July, this waſp is
ſeen moſt diligently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. The whole purpoſe of its life ſeems to
be in contriving and fitting up a commodious apartment for its young one, which
is not to ſucceed it till the year enſuing. For this end it is employed,
with unwearied aſſiduity, in boring a hole into the fineſt earth ſome
inches deep, but not much wider than the diameter of its own body. This is but
a gallery lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a wider apartment deſtined for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0824000108:104"/> lodgment of its young. As it always chuſes a gravelly
ſoil to work in, and where the earth is almoſt as hard as ſtone itſelf;
the digging and hollowing this apartment is an enterprize of no ſmall labour:
for effecting its operations, this inſect is furniſhed with two teeth,
which are ſtrong and firm, but not ſufficiently hard to penetrate the
ſubſtance through which it is reſolved to make its way. In order
therefore to ſoften that earth which it is unable to pierce, it is
furniſhed with a gummy liquor which it emits upon the place, and which
renders it more eaſily ſeparable from the reſt, and the whole becoming a
kind of ſoft paſte is removed to the mouth of the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The animal's
proviſion of liquor in theſe operations is however ſoon exhauſted; and
it is then ſeen either taking up water from ſome neighbouring flower or
ſtream in order to ſupply the deficiency.</p>
               <p>At length, after much toil, a hole ſome inches deep is formed,
at the bottom of which is a large cavity; and to this no other hoſtile
inſect would venture to find its way, from the length and the narrowneſs of
the defile through which it would be obliged to paſs. In this the ſolitary
waſp lays its egg, which is deſtined to continue the ſpecies; there the
naſcent animal <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0824000108:105"/> is to continue for above nine months,
unattend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and immured, and at firſt appearance the moſt helpleſs
inſect of the creation. But when we come to examine, new wonders offer, no
other inſect can boaſt ſo copiouſly luxurious a proviſion, or ſuch
confirmed ſecurity.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the mother waſp has depoſited her egg at the
bottom of the hole, her next care is to furniſh it with a ſupply of
proviſions, which may be offered to the young inſect as ſoon as it leaves
the egg. To this end ſhe procures a number of little green worms, generally
from eight to twelve, and theſe are to ſerve as food for the young one the
inſtant it awakens into life. When this ſupply is regularly arranged and
laid in, the old one then, with as much aſſiduity as it before worked out
its hole, now cloſes the mouth of the paſſage; and thus leaving its young
one immured in perfect ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and in a copious ſupply of animal food,
ſhe dies ſatisfied with having provided for a future progeny.</p>
               <p>When the young one leaves the egg it is ſcarcely viſible,
and is ſeen immured among a number of inſects, infinitely larger than
itſelf, ranged in proper order around it, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever give it no manner
of apprehenſion. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the parent, when ſhe laid in the inſect 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0824000108:106"/> proviſion, contrived to diſable the worms from
reſiſtance, or whether they were at firſt incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any, is not
known. Certain it is, that the young glutton feaſts upon the living ſpoil
without any controul; his game lies at his hand, and he devours one after the
other as the calls of appetite incite him. The life of the young animal is
therefore ſpent in the moſt luxurious manner, till its whole ſtock of
worms is exhauſted, and then the time of its transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation begins to
approach; and then ſpinning a ſilken web, it continues fixed in its cell
till the ſun calls it from its dark abode the enſuing ſummer.</p>
               <p>The waſps of Europe are very miſchievous, yet they are
innocence itſelf when compared to thoſe of the tropical climates, where all
the inſect tribes are not only numerous, but large, voracious, and
formidable. Thoſe of the Weſt Indies are thicker, and twice as long as the
common bee; they are of a grey colour, ſtriped with yellow, and armed with a
very dangerous ſting. They make their cells in the manner of a honey-comb, in
which the young ones are hatched and bred. They generally hang their neſts by
threads, compoſed of the ſame ſubſtance with the cells, to the branches
of trees, and the eaves of houſes. They are <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0824000108:107"/> ſeen
every where in great abundance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending like fruit, particularly pears,
of which ſhape they are, and as large as one's head. The inſide is divided
into three round ſtories, full of cells, each hexagonal, like thoſe of an
honey-comb. In ſome of the iſlands, theſe inſects are ſo very
numerous, that their neſts are ſtuck up in this manner, ſcarce two feet
aſunder, and the inhabitants are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual apprehenſion from their
accidental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. It ſometimes happens, that no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions can
prevent their attacks, and the pains of their ſting is almoſt
inſupportable. Thoſe who have felt it think it more terrible than even that
of a ſcorpion; the whole viſage ſwells, and the features are ſo
disfigured, that a perſon is ſcarcely known by his moſt intimate
acquaintance.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Ichnumon Fly.</head>
               <p>EVERY rank of inſects, how voracious ſoever, have enemies
that are terrible to them, and that revenge upon them the injuries done upon
the reſt of the animated creation. The waſp, as we have ſeen, is very
troubleſome to man, and very formidable to the inſect tribe; but the
ichnumon fly (of which there are many varieties) fears not the waſp itſelf,
it enters its retreats, plunders its habitations, and takes poſſeſſion
of that cell for its own young, which the waſp had laboriouſly built for a
dearer poſterity.</p>
               <p>Though there are many different kinds of this inſect, yet the
moſt formidable, and that beſt known, is called the common ichnumon, with
four wings, like the bee, a long ſlender black body, and a three forked tail,
conſiſting of briſtles; the two outermoſt black, and the middlemoſt
red. This fly receives its name from the little quadrupede, which is found to
be ſo deſtructive to the crocodile, as it bears a ſtrong ſimilitude in
its courage and rapacity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0824000108:109"/>Though this inſtrument is, to all
appearance, ſlender and feeble, yet it is found to be a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon of great
force and efficacy. There is ſcarce any ſubſtance which it will not
pierce; and, indeed, it is ſeldom ſeen but employed in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration. This
is the weapon of defence, this is employed in deſtroying its prey, and
ſtill more, by this the animal depoſites her eggs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe thinks
fit to lay them. As it is an inſtrument chiefly employed for this purpoſe,
the male is unprovided with ſuch a ſting, while the female uſes it with
great force and dexterity, brandiſhing it when caught, from ſide to ſide,
and very often wounding thoſe who thought they held her with the greateſt
ſecurity.</p>
               <p>All the flies of this tribe are produced in the ſame manner,
and owe their birth to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſome other inſect, within
whoſe body they have been depoſed, and upon whoſe vitals they have
preyed, till they came to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. There is no inſect whatever, which they
will not attack, in order to leave their fatal preſent in its body; the
caterpillar, the gnat, and even the ſpider himſelf, ſo formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to
others, is often made the unwilling foſterer of this deſtructive
progeny.</p>
               <p>About the middle of ſummer, when other inſects are found in
great abundance, the ich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numon <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0824000108:110"/> is ſeen flying buſily
about, and ſeeking proper objects upon whom to depoſe its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny. As
there are various kinds of this fly, ſo they ſeem to have various
appetites. Some are found to place their eggs within the aurelia of ſome
naſcent inſect, others place them within the neſt, which the waſp had
curiouſly contrived for its own young; and as both are produced at the ſame
time, the young of the ichnumon, not only devours the young waſp, but the
whole ſupply of worms, which the parent had carefully provided for its
proviſion. But the greateſt number of the ichnumon tribe are ſeen
ſettling upon the back of the caterpillar, and darting, at different
intervals, their ſtings into its body. At every dart they depoſe an egg,
while the wounded animal ſeems ſcarcely ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the injury it
ſuſtains. In this manner they leave from ſix to a dozen of their eggs,
within the fatty ſubſtance of the reptile's body, and then fly off to
commit further depredations. In the mean time the caterpillar thus irreparably
injured, ſeems to feed as voraciouſly as before, does not abate of its
uſual activity; and to all appearance, ſeems no way affected by the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal enemies that are preparing its deſtruction in their darkſome
abode. But they ſoon burſt from their egg ſtate, and begin to prey upon 
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0824000108:111"/> the ſubſtance of their priſon. As they grow
larger, they require a greater ſupply, till at laſt the animal, by whoſe
vitals they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, is no longer able to ſuſtain them, but dies;
its whole inſide being almoſt eaten away. It often happens, however, that
it ſurvives their worm ſtate, and then they change into a chryſalis,
encloſed in the caterpillar's body till the time of their delivery
approaches, when they burſt their priſons and fly away. The caterpillar,
however, is irreparably deſtroyed, it never changes into a chryſalis, but
dies ſhortly after, from the injuries it had ſuſtained.</p>
               <p>Such is the hiſtory of this fly, which though very terrible to
the inſect tribe, fails not to be of infinite ſervice to mankind. The
millions which it kills in a ſingle ſummer, are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable; and
without ſuch a deſtroyer, the fruits of the earth would only riſe to
furniſh a banquet for the inſect race, to the excluſion of all the nobler
ranks of animated nature.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of the Ant.</head>
               <p>THOUGH the number of two winged flies be very great, and the
naturaliſts have taken ſome pains to deſcribe their characters and
varieties; yet there is ſuch a ſimilitude in their forms and manners, that
in a work like this, one deſcription muſt ſerve for all. We now
therefore, come to a ſpecies of four winged inſects, that are famous from
all antiquity, for their ſocial and induſtrious habits, that are marked for
their ſpirit of ſubordination, that are offered as a pattern of
parſimony, to the profuſe, and of unremitting diligence to the
ſluggard.</p>
               <p>In the experiments, however, which have been more recently made,
and the obſervations which have been taken, much of their boaſted frugality
and precaution ſeems denied them; the treaſures they lay up, are no longer
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, intended for future proviſion, and the choice they make in
their ſtores, ſeems no way dictated by wiſdom. It is, indeed, ſomewhat
ſurprizing, that almoſt every writer of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhould deſcribe
this inſect, as labouring in the ſummer, and feaſting upon the produce 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0824000108:113"/> during the winter. Perhaps, in ſome of the warmer
climates, where the winter is mild, and of ſhort contiuance, this may take
place; but in France and England, theſe animals can have no manner of
occaſion for a ſupply of winter proviſions, as they are actually in a
ſtate of torpidity during that ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The common ants of Europe, are of two or three different kinds;
ſome red, ſome black, ſome with ſtings, and others without. Such as
have ſtings, inflict their wounds in that manner; ſuch as are unprovided
with theſe weapons of defence, have a power of ſpurting, from their hinder
parts, an acid pungent liquor, which, if it lights upon the ſkin, inflames
and burns it like nettles.</p>
               <p>The body of an ant is divided, into the head, breaſt and
belly. In the head, the eyes are placed, which are entirely black, and under
the eyes, there are two ſmall horns or feelers, compoſed of twelve joints,
all covered with a fine ſilky hair. The mouth is furniſhed with two crooked
jaws, which project outwards, in each of which are ſeen inciſures, that
look like teeth. The breaſt is covered with a fine ſilky hair, from which
project ſix legs, that are pretty ſtrong and hairy, the extremities of each
armed with two ſmall claws, which the animal uſes in <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0824000108:114"/>
climbing. The belly is more reddiſh than the reſt of the body, which is of
a brown cheſnut colour, it is as ſhining as glaſs, and covered with
extremely fine hair.</p>
               <p>From ſuch a formation, this animal ſeems bolder, and more
active, for its ſize, than any other of the inſect tribe, and fears not to
attack a creature, often above ten times its own mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the winter is paſt, in the firſt fine day in
April, the ant hill, that before ſeemed a deſart, now ſwarms with new
life, and myriads of theſe inſects are ſeen juſt awaked from their
annual lethargy, and preparing for the pleaſures and fatigues of the
ſeaſon. For the firſt day they never offer to leave the hill, which may
be conſidered as their citadel, but run over every part of it, as if to
examine its preſent ſituation, to obſerve what injuries it has
ſuſtained during the rigours of winter,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Memoires pour ſervoir a l' Hiſtoire des inſectes par

                  </note> while they ſlept, and to mediate and ſettle
the labours of the day enſuing.</p>
               <p>At the firſt diſplay of their forces, none but the
wingleſs tribe appears, while thoſe furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with wings remain at the
bottom. Theſe are the working ants, that firſt appear, and that 
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0824000108:115"/> are always deſtitute of wings; the males and females,
that are furniſhed with four large wings each, are more ſlow in making
their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
               <p>Thus, like bees, they are divided into males, females, and the
neutral or the working tribe. Theſe are all eaſily diſtinguiſhed from
each other; the females are much larger than the males; the working ants are
the ſmalleſt of all. The two former have wings; which, however, they
ſometimes are diveſted of; the latter never have any, and upon them are
devolved all the labours that tend to the welfare of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The
female, alſo, may be diſtinguiſhed, by the colour and ſtructure of her
breaſt, which is a little more brown, than that of the common ant, and a
little brighter than that of the male.</p>
               <p>In eight or ten days after their firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the
labours of the hill are in ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs; the males and females are
ſeen mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the working multitude, and purſued or purſuing each
other. They ſeem no way to partake in the common drugeries of the ſtate;
the males purſue the females with great aſſiduity, and in a manner, force
them to compliance. They remain coupled for ſome time, while the males thus
united, ſuffer themſelves to be drawn along by the will of their

ſtate take no part in their pleaſures, they are ſeen diligently going
from the ant-hill, in purſuit of food for themſelves and their
aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, and of proper materials for giving a comfortable retreat to
their young, or ſafety to their habitation. In the fields of England,
ant-hills are formed with but little apparent regularity. In the more
ſouthern provinces of Europe, they are conſtructed with wonderful
contrivance, and offer a ſight highly worthy a naturaliſt's curioſity.
Theſe are generally formed in the neighbourhood of ſome large tree and a
ſtream of water. The one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by the animals, as the proper place
for getting food; the other for ſupplying them with moiſture, which they
cannot well diſpenſe with. The ſhape of the ant-hill, is that of a
ſugar loaf, about three feet high, compoſed of various ſubſtances;
leaves, bits of wood, ſand, earth, bits of gum, and grains of corn. Theſe
are all united into a compact body, perforated with galleries down to the
bottom, and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ways within the body of the ſtructure. From this
retreat, to the water, as well as to the tree, in different directions, there
are many paths worn by conſtant aſſiduity, and along theſe the buſy
inſects are ſeen paſſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0824000108:117"/>
continually; ſo that from May, or the beginning of June, according to the
ſtate of the ſeaſon, they work continually, till the bad weather comes
on.</p>
               <p>The chief employment of the working ants, is in ſuſtaining
not only the idlers at home, but alſo finding a ſufficiency of food for
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They live upon various proviſions, as well of the vegetable as
of the animal kind. Small inſects they will kill and devour; ſweets of all
kinds, they are particularly fond of. They ſeldom, however, think of their
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, till they themſelves are firſt ſatiated. Having found a juicy
fruit, they ſwallow what they can, and then tearing it in pieces, carry home
their load. If they meet with an inſect above their match, ſeveral of them
will fall upon it at once, and having mangled it, each will carry off a part of
the ſpoil. If they meet, in their excurſions, any thing that is too heavy
for one to bear, and yet, which they are unable to divide, ſeveral of them
will endeavour to force it along; ſome dragging and others puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If any
one of them happens to make a lucky diſcovery, it will immediately give
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to others, and then at once, the whole republic will put themſelves
in motion. If in theſe ſtruggles, one of them happens to be 
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0824000108:118"/> killed, ſome kind ſurvivor will carry him off to a
great diſtance, to prevent the obſtructions his body may give to the
general ſpirit of induſtry.</p>
               <p>But while they are thus employed in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate,
in feeding abroad, and carrying in proviſions to thoſe that continue at
home, they are not unmindful of poſterity. After a few days of fine weather,
the female ants begin to lay their eggs, and thoſe are as aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
watched and protected by the working ants, who take upon themſelves to
ſupply whatever is wanting to the naſcent animal's convenience or
neceſſity. They are carried as ſoon as laid, to the ſafeſt
ſituation, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of their hill, where they are carefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
from cold and moiſture. We are not to ſuppoſe, that thoſe white
ſubſtances which we ſo plentifully find in every ant-hill, are the eggs
as newly laid. On the contrary, the ant's egg is ſo very ſmall, that,
though laid upon a black ground, it can ſcarcely be diſcerned. The little
white bodies we ſee, are the young animals in their maggot ſtate, endued
with life, long ſince freed from the egg, and often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in a cone,
which it has ſpun round it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, like the ſilk worm. The real egg when
laid, if viewed through a microſcope, appears ſmooth, poliſhed and
ſhining, while the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0824000108:119"/> is ſeen compoſed of
twelve rings, and is oftener larger than the ant itſelf.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the fond attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the
working ants ſhew to their riſing progeny. In cold weather they take them
in their mouths, but without offering them the ſmalleſt injury, to the very
depths of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, where they are leſs ſubject to the ſeverity
of the ſeaſon. In a fine day they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them, with the ſame care,
nearer the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, where their maturity may be aſſiſted by the warm
beams of the ſun. If a formidable enemy ſhould come to batter down their
whole habitation, and cruſh them by thouſands in the ruin, yet theſe
wonderful inſects, ſtill mindful of their parental duties, make it their
firſt care to ſave their offspring. They are ſeen running wildly about
and different ways, each loaded with a young one, often bigger than the
inſect that ſupports it. I have kept, ſays Swammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſeveral of the
working ants in my cloſet, with their young, in a glaſs filled with earth.
I took pleaſure in obſerving, that in proportion as the earth dried on the
ſurface, they dug deeper and deeper to depoſite their eggs; and when I
poured water thereon, it was ſurpriſing to ſee with what care, affection,
and diligence they laboured, to put their brood in ſafety, in 
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0824000108:120"/> the drieſt place. I have ſeen alſo, that when
water has been wanting for ſeveral days, and when the earth was moiſtened
after it a little, they immediately carried their young ones to have a ſhare,
who ſeemed to enjoy and ſuck the moiſture.</p>
               <p>When the young maggot is come to its full growth, the breaſt
ſwells inſenſibly, it caſts its ſkin, and loſes all motion. All the
members which were hidden before, then begin to appear, an aurelia is formed,
which repreſents very diſtinctly, all the parts of the animal, though they
are yet without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as it were, wrapped up in ſwaddling-cloaths.
When at length, the little inſect has paſſed through all its changes, and
acquired its proper maturity, it burſts this laſt ſkin, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
the form it is to retain ever after. Yet this is not done by the efforts of the
little ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal alone, for the old ones very aſſiduouſly break open, with
their teeth, the covering in which it is encloſed. Without this
aſſiſtance the aurelia would never be able to get free, as Mr. De Geer
often found, who tried the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, by leaving the aurelia to themſelves.
The old ones not only aſſiſt them, but know the very preciſe time for
lending their aſſiſtance, for if produced too ſoon the young one dies
of <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0824000108:121"/> cold, if retarded too long it is ſuffocated in its
priſon.</p>
               <p>When the female has done laying, and the whole brood is thus
produced, her labours, as well as that of the male, become unneceſſary, and
her wings, which ſhe had but a ſhort time before ſo actively employed,
drop off. What becomes of her when thus diveſted of her orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is not
well known, for ſhe is ſeen in the cells for ſome weeks after. The males,
on the other hand, having no longer any occupation at home, make uſe of
thoſe wings with which they have been furniſhed by nature, and fly away,
never to return, or to be heard of more. It is probable they periſh with the
cold, or are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the birds, which are particularly fond of this petty
prey.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the working ants having probably depoſed
their queens, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the males, that ſerved but to clog the
community, prepare for the ſeverity of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and bury their retreats
as deep in the earth as they conveniently can. It is now found that the grains
of corn, and other ſubſtances with which they furniſh their hill, are
only meant as fences to keep off the rigours of the weather, not as
proviſions to ſupport them during its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. It is found generally
to obtain, that <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0824000108:122"/> every inſect that lives a year after
it is come to its full growth, is obliged to paſs four or five months without
taking any nouriſhment, and will ſeem to be dead all that time. It would be
to no purpoſe therefore for ants to lay up corn for the winter, ſince they
lie that time without motion, heaped upon each other, and are ſo far from
eating, that they are utterly unable to ſtir. Thus what authors have
dignified by the name of a magazine, appears to be no more than a cavity, which
ſerves for a common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat when the weather forces them to return to their
lethargic ſtate.</p>
               <p>What has been ſaid with exaggeration of the European ant, is
however true, if aſſerted of thoſe of the tropical climates. They build
an ant-hill with great contrivance and regularity, they lay up proviſions,
and, as they probably live the whole year, they ſubmit themſelves to
regulations entirely unknown among the ants of Europe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of Africa are of three kinds, the red, the green and the
black; the latter are above an inch long, and in every reſpect a moſt
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable inſect. Their ſting produces extreme pain, and their
depredations are ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely deſtructive. They build an ant-hill
of a very great ſize, from ſix to twelve feet high; <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0824000108:123"/>
it is made of viſcous clay, and tapers into a py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramidal form. This
habitation is conſtructed with great artifice, and the cells are ſo
nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and even, that a honey-comb ſcarce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds them in number and
regularity.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of this edifice ſeem to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a very
ſtrict regulation. At the ſlighteſt warning they will ſally out upon
whatever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbs them, and if they have time to arreſt their enemies, he
is ſure to find no mercy. Sheep, hens, and even rats are often deſtroyed by
theſe mercileſs inſects, and their fleſh devoured to the bone. No
anatomiſt in the world can ſtrip a ſkeleton ſo cleanly as they, and no
animal, how ſtrong ſoever, when they have once ſeized upon it, has power
to reſiſt them.</p>
               <p>It often happens that theſe inſects quit their retreat in a
body, and go in queſt of adventures. 
<q rend="inline">"During my ſtay," ſays Smith, "at Cape
Corſe Caſtle, a body of theſe ants came to pay us a viſit in our
fortification. It was about day-break when the advanced guard of this
famiſhed crew entered the chapel, where ſome negroe ſervants were
aſleep upon the floor. The men were quickly alarmed at the invaſion of this
unexpected army, and prepared, as well as they could, for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. While the
foremoſt battalion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0824000108:124"/> had already taken
poſſeſſion of the place, the rear guard was more than a quarter of a
mile diſtant. The whole ground ſeemed alive and crawling with unceaſing
deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After deliberating a few moments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what was to be done, it
was reſolved to lay a large train of gunpowder along the path they had taken,
by this means millions were blown to pieces, and the rear guard peceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
deſtruction of their leaders, thought proper inſtantly to return, and make
back to their original habitation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The order which theſe ants obſerve, ſeems very
extraordinary; whenever they ſally forth, fifty or ſixty larger than the
reſt are ſeen to head the band, and conduct them to their deſtined prey.
If they have a fixed ſpot where their prey continues to reſort to, they
then form a vaulted gallery, which is ſometimes a quarter of a mile in
length, and yet, they will hollow it out in the ſpace of ten or twelve
hours.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Beetle and its Varieties.</head>
               <p>HITHERTO we have been treating of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects with four
tranſparent wings, we now come to a tribe with two tranſparent wings, with
caſes that cover them cloſe while at reſt, but which allow them their
proper play when fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The principal of theſe are the Beetle, the May Bug,
and the Cantharis. Theſe are all bred like the reſt of their order, firſt
from eggs, then they become grubs, then a chryſalis in which the parts of the
future fly are diſtinctly ſeen, and laſtly the animal leaves its
priſon, breaking forth as a winged animal in full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.</p>
               <p>Of the Beetle there are various kinds; all, however, concurring
in one common formation of having caſes to their wings, which are the more
neceſſary to thoſe inſects, as they often live under the ſurface of
the earth, in holes, which they dig out by their own induſtry. Theſe
caſes prevent the various injuries their real wings might ſuſtain, by
rubbing or cruſhing againſt the ſides of their abode. Theſe, though

                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0824000108:127"/> they do not aſſiſt flight,
yet keep the internal wings clean and even, and produce a loud buzzing noiſe,
when the animal riſes in the air.</p>
               <p>If we examine the formation of all animals, of the beetle kind,
we ſhall find, as in ſhell-fiſh, that their bones are placed externally,
and their muſcles within. Theſe muſcles are formed very much like thoſe
of quadrupedes, and are endued with ſuch ſurprizing ſtrength, that bulk
for bulk, they are a thouſand times ſtronger than thoſe of a man. The
ſtrength of theſe muſcles is of uſe in digging the animal's
ſubterraneous abode, where it is moſt uſually hatched, and to which it
moſt frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, even after it becomes a winged inſect, capable of
flying.</p>
               <p>Beſide the difference which reſults from the ſhape and
colour of theſe animals, the ſize alſo makes a conſiderable one; ſome
beetles being not larger than the head of a pin, while others, ſuch as the
elephant beetle, are as big as ones fiſt: But the greateſt difference among
them is, that ſome are produced in a month, and in a ſingle ſeaſon go
through all the ſtages of their exiſtence, while others take near four
years to their production; and live as winged inſects a year more. To give
the hiſtory of all theſe <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0824000108:128"/> animals, that are bred
pretty much in the ſame way, would be inſipid and endleſs; it will
ſuffice to ſelect one or two from the number, the origin of which may
ſerve as ſpecimens of the reſt. I will, therefore, offer the hiſtory of
the may-bug to the reader's attention; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, that moſt other beetles,
though not ſo long lived, are bred in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>The may-bug, or dorr-beetle, as ſome call it, has, like all
the reſt, a pair of caſes to its wings, which are of a reddiſh brown
colour, ſprinkled with a whitiſh duſt, which eaſily comes off. In
ſome years their necks are ſeen covered with a red plate, and in others,
with a black; theſe, however, are diſtinct ſorts, and their difference is
by no means accidental. The fore legs are very ſhort, and the better
calculated for burrowing in the ground, where this inſect makes its retreat.
It is well known for its evening buzz to children; but till more formidably
introduced to the acquaintance of huſbandmen and gardeners, for in ſome
ſeaſons, it has been found to ſwarm in ſuch numbers, as to eat up every
vegetable production.</p>
               <p>The two ſexes in the may-bug, are eaſily diſtinguiſhed
from each other, by the ſuperior length of the tufts, at the end of the
horns, in <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0824000108:129"/> the male. They begin to copulate in ſummer,
and at that ſeaſon, they are ſeen joined together for a conſiderable
time. The female being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated, quickly falls to boring a hole into the
ground, where to depoſit her burthen. This is generally about half a foot
deep, and in it the places her eggs, which are of an oblong ſhape, with great
regularity, one by the other. They are of a bright yellow colour, and no way
wrapped up in a common covering, as ſome have imagined. When the female is
lightened of her burthen, ſhe again aſcends from her hole, to live as
before, upon leaves and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, to buzz in the ſummer evening, and to
lie hid, among the branches of trees, in the heat of the day.</p>
               <p>In about three months after theſe eggs have been thus
depoſited in the earth, the contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſect begins to break its ſhell,
and a ſmall grub or maggot crawls forth, and feeds upon the roots of whatever
vegetable it happens to be neareſt. All ſubſtances, of this kind, ſeem
equally grateful, yet it is probable the mother inſect has a choice among
what kind of veget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables ſhe ſhall depoſit her young. In this manner
theſe voracious creatures continue in the worm ſtate, for more than three
years, devouring the roots of every plant they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0824000108:130"/> and making their way under ground, in queſt of food, with great
diſpatch and facility. At length they grow to above the ſize of a walnut,
being a great thick white maggot with a red head, which is ſeen moſt
frequently in new turned earth, and which is ſo eagerly ſought after by
birds of every ſpecies. When largeſt, they are found an inch and an half
long, of a whitiſh yellow colour, with a body conſiſting of twelve
ſeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or joints, on each ſide of which, there are nine breathing holes,
and three red feet. The head is large, in proportion to the body, of a
reddiſh colour, with a pincer before, and a ſemi-circular lip, with which
it cuts the roots of plants, and ſucks out their moiſture. As this inſect
lives entirely under ground, it has no occaſion for eyes, and accordingly it
is found to have none; but is furniſhed with two feelers, which, like the
crutch of a blind man, ſerve to direct its motions. Such is the form of this
animal, that lives for years in the worm ſtate under ground, ſtill
voracious, and every year changing its ſkin.</p>
               <p>It is not till the end of the fourth year, that this
extraordinary inſect prepares to emerge from its ſubterraneous abode, and
even this is not effected, but by a tedious preparation. <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0824000108:131"/>
About the latter end of autumn, the grub be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to perceive the approaches of
its tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it then buries itſelf deeper and deeper in the earth,
ſometimes ſix feet beneath the ſurface, and there forms itſelf a
capacious apartment, the walls of which it renders very ſmooth and ſhining,
by the excretions of its body. Its abode being thus formed, it begins ſoon
after, to ſhorten itſelf, to ſwell, and to burſt its laſt ſkin, in
order to aſſume the form of a chryſalis. This, in the beginning, appears
of a yellowiſh colour, which heightens by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, till at laſt, it is
ſeen nearly red. Its exterior form plainly diſcovers all the veſtiges of
the future winged inſect, all the fore parts being diſtinctly ſeen; while
behind, the animal ſeems as if wrapped in ſwaddling cloaths.</p>
               <p>The young may-bug continues in this ſtate for about three
months longer, and it is not till the beginning of January, that the aurelia
diveſts itſelf of all its impediments, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a winged inſect,
completely formed. Yet ſtill the animal is far from attaining its natural
ſtrength, health, and appetite. It un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes a kind of infant imbecillity,
and unlike moſt other inſects, that the inſtant they become flies are
arrived at their ſtate of full perfection, the may-bug continues feeble and
ſickly. <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0824000108:132"/> Its colour is much brighter than in the
perfect animal, all its parts are ſoft, and its voracious nature ſeems for
a while, to have entirely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken it. As the animal is very often found in
this ſtate, it is ſuppoſed, by thoſe unacquainted with its real
hiſtory, that the old ones, of the former ſeaſon, have buried
themſelves for the winter, in order to reviſit the ſun the enſuing
ſummer. But the fact is, the old one never ſurvives the ſeaſon but
dies, like all the other winged tribe of inſects, from the ſeverity of cold
in winter.</p>
               <p>About the latter end of May, theſe inſects, after having
lived for four years under ground, burſt from the earth, when the firſt
mild even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invites them abroad. They are at that time ſeen riſing from
their long impriſonment, from living only upon roots, and imbibing only the
moiſture of the earth, to viſit the mildneſs of the ſummer air, to
chuſe the ſweeteſt vegetables for their banquet, and to drink the dew of
the evening. Wherever an attentive obſerver then walks abroad, he will ſee
them burſting up before him in his pathway, like ghoſts on a theatre. He
will ſee every part of the earth, that had its ſurface beaten into
hardneſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated by their egreſſion. When the ſeaſon is
favourable for them, they are ſeen by myriads <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0824000108:133"/> buzzing
along, hitting againſt every object that intercepts their flight. The mid-day
ſun, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſeems too powerful for their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; they then
lurk under the leaves and branches of ſome ſhady tree; but the willow
ſeems particularly, their moſt favourite food; there they lurk in
cluſters, and ſeldom quit the tree till they have devoured all its
ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. In thoſe ſeaſons, which are favourable to their propagation,
they are ſeen in an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as thick as flakes of ſnow, and hitting
againſt every object with a ſort of capricious blindneſs. Their duration,
however, is but ſhort, as they never ſurvive the ſeaſon. They begin to
join ſhortly after they have been let looſe from their priſon, and when
the female is impregnated, the cautiouſly bores a hole in the ground, with an
inſtrument fitted for that purpoſe, which the is furniſhed with at the
tail, and there depoſits her eggs, generally to the number of threeſcore.
If the ſeaſon and the ſoil be adapted to their propagation, theſe
ſoon multiply as already deſcribed, and go through their noxious ſtages
of their contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible exiſtence. This inſect, however, in its worm
ſtate, though prejudicial to man, makes one of the chief repaſts of the
feathered tribe, and is generally the firſt nouriſhment with 
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0824000108:134"/> which they ſupply their young: Rooks, and hogs are
particularly fond of theſe worms, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them in great numbers. The
inhabitants of the county of Norfolk, ſome time ſince, went into the
practice of deſtroying their rookeries, but in proportion, as they
deſtroyed one plague, they were peſtered with greater; and theſe
inſects multiplied in ſuch an amazing abundance, as to deſtroy not only
the verdure of the fields, but even the roots of vegetables, not yet ſhot
forth. One farm in particular was ſo injured by them in the year 1751, that
the occupier was not able to pay his rent, and the landlord was not only
content to loſe his income for that year, but alſo gave money for the
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the farmer and his family. In Ireland they ſuffered ſo much
by theſe inſects, that they came to a reſolution of ſetting fire to a
wood, of ſome miles in extent, to prevent their miſchievous
propagation.</p>
               <p>Of all the beetle kind this is the moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and
therefore deſerves the chief attention of hiſtory. The numerous varieties
of other kinds, might repay the curioſity of the diligent obſerver, but we
muſt be content in general to obſerve, that in the great out-lines of the
hiſtory, they reſemble thoſe of which we have juſt been giving a
deſcription; like them, all <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0824000108:135"/> other beetles are bred
from the egg, which is depoſited in the ground, or ſometimes, tho'
ſeldom, in the barks of trees, they change into a worm; they ſubſiſt in
that ſtate by living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the roots of vegetables, or the ſucculent parts
of the bark round them. They generally live a year at leaſt before they
change into an aurelia; in that ſtate they are, not entirely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs,
nor intirely ſwaddled up without form.</p>
               <p>It would be tedious and endleſs to give a deſcription of
all, and yet it would be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable omiſſion not to mention the
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities of ſome beetles, which are ſingular rather from their
ſize, their manners, or their formation. That beetle which the Americans call
the tumble-dung, particularly demands our attention; it is all over of a
duſky black, rounder than thoſe animals are generally found to be, and ſo
ſtrong, tho' not much larger than the common black beetle, that if one of
them be put under a braſs candleſtick, it will cauſe it to move backwards
and forwards, as if it were by an inviſible hand, to the admiration of
thoſe who are not accuſtomed to the ſight; but this ſtrength is given
it for much more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful purpoſes than thoſe of exciting human
curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, for there is no creature more laborious, either in ſeeking
ſubſiſtence, or in providing a <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0824000108:136"/> proper retreat for
its young. They are endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſagacity to diſcover ſubſiſtence by
their excellent ſmelling, which directs them in flights to excrements juſt
fallen from man or beaſt, on which they inſtantly drop, and fall
unanimouſly to work in forming round balls or pellets there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the middle
of which they lay an egg. Theſe pellets, in September, they convey three feet
deep in the earth, where they lye till the approach of ſpring, when the eggs
are hatched and burnt their neſts, and the inſects find their way out of
the earth. They aſſiſt each other with indefatigable induſtry, in
rolling theſe globular pellets to the place where they are to be buried. This
they are to perform with the tail foremoſt, by raiſing up their hinder
part, and ſhoving along the ball with their hind-feet. They are always
accompanied with other beetles of a larger ſize, and of a more elegant
ſtructure and colour. The breaſt of this is covered with a ſhield of a
crimſon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and ſhining-like metal; the head is of the like colour,
mixed with green, and on the crown of the head ſtands a ſhining black horn,
bended backwards. Theſe are called the kings of the beetles, but for what
reaſon is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſince they partake of the ſame dirty drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery with
the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0824000108:137"/>The Elephant-beetle is the largeſt of
this kind hitherto known, and is found in South-America, particularly Guiana
and Surinam, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the river Oroonoko. It is of a black co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and the whole body is covered with a very hard ſhell, full as thick and as
ſtrong as that of a ſmall crab. Its length, from the hinder part to the
eyes, is almoſt four inches, and from the ſame part to the end of the
proboſcis, or trunk, four inches and three quarters. The tranſverſe
dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the body is two inches and a quarter, and the breadth of each
elytron, or caſe for the wings, is an inch and three tenths. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennae or
feelers, are quite horny; for which reaſon the proboſcis or trunk is
moveable at its inſertion into the head, and ſeems to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place
of feelers. The horns are eight tenths of an inch long, and terminate in
points. The proboſcis is an inch and a quarter long, and turns upwards,
making a crooked line, terminating in two horns, each of which is near a
quarter of an inch long; but they are not perforated at the end like the
proboſcis of other inſects. About four tenths of an inch above the head, or
that ſide next the body, is a prominence, or ſmall horn, which if the
reſt of the trunk were away, would cauſe this part to reſemble the horn
of a rhinoceros. There is <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0824000108:138"/> indeed a beetle ſo called,
but then the horns or trunk has no fork at, the end, though the lower horn
reſembles this. The feet are all forked at the end, but not like lobſters
claws.</p>
               <p>To this claſs we may alſo refer the glow-worm, that little
animal which makes ſuch a diſtinguiſhed figure in the deſcriptions of
our poets. No two inſects can differ more than the male and female of this
ſpecies from each other. The male is in every reſpect a beetle, having
caſes to its wings, and riſing in the air at pleaſure; the female, on the
contrary has none, but is entirely a creeping inſect, and is obliged to wait
the approaches of her capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious companion. The body of the female has eleven
joints, with a ſhield breaſt-plate, the ſhape of which is oval; the head
is placed over this, and is very ſmall, and the three laſt joints of her
body are of a yellowiſh colour; but what diſtinguiſhes it from all other
animals, at leaſt in this part of the world, is the ſhining light which it
emits by night, and which is ſuppoſed by force philoſophers, to be an
emanation which ſhe ſends forth to allure the male to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Moſt
travellers who have gone through ſandy countries, muſt well remember the
little ſhining ſparks with which the ditches are ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on each ſide
of the road. If incited by <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0824000108:139"/> curioſity to approach more
nearly, he will find the light ſent forth by the glow-worm; if he ſhould
keep the little animal for ſome time, its light continues to grow paler, and
at laſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears totally extinct: The manner in which this light is produced
has hitherto continued inexplicable; it is probable the little animal is
ſupplied with ſome electrical powers, ſo that by rubbing the joints of
its body againſt each other, it thus ſupplies a ſtream of light which if
it allures the male, as we are told, ſerves for very uſeful purpoſes.</p>
               <p>The cantharis is of the beetle kind, from whence come
cantharides, well known in the chops by the name of Spaniſh flies, and for
their uſe in bliſters. They have feelers like briſtles, flexible caſes
to the wings, a breaſt pretty plain, and the ſides of the belly wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Cantharides differ from each other in their ſize, ſhape, and colour,
thoſe uſed in the ſhops alſo do the ſame. The largeſt in theſe
parts are about an inch long, and as much in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, but others are not
above three quarters of an inch. Some are of a pure azure colour, others of
pure gold, and others again, have a mixture of pure gold and azure colours; but
they are all very brilliant, and extremely beautiful. Theſe inſects, as is
well <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0824000108:140"/> known, are of the greateſt benefit to mankind,
making a part in many medicines conducive to human preſervation. They are
chiefly natives of Spain, Italy, and Portugal; but they are to be met with
alſo about Paris in the ſummer time, upon the leaves of the aſh, the
poplar, and the roſe-trees, and alſo among wheat, and in meadows. It is
very certain, that theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects are fond of aſh leaves, inſomuch that
they will ſometimes ſtrip one of theſe trees quite bare. Some affirm,
that theſe flies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſweet-ſmelling herbs, and it is very
certain, that they are fond of honey-ſuckles, liloc, and wild-cherry
ſhrubs; but ſome that have ſought after them declare, they never could
find them on elder-trees, nut-trees, and among wheat. We are told, that the
country people expect the return of theſe inſects every ſeven years. It
is very certain, that ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe inſects have been ſeen
together in the air, that they appeared like ſwarms of bees; and that they
have ſo diſagreeable a ſmell, that it may be perceived a great way off,
eſpecially about ſun-ſet, though they are not ſeen at that time. This
bad ſmell is a guide for thoſe who make it their buſineſs to catch
them. When they are caught they dry them, after which they are ſo light, that
fifty will hardly weigh a <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0824000108:141"/> dram. Thoſe that gather
them, tie them in a bag, or a piece of linnen cloth, that has been well worn,
and then they kill them with the vapours of hot vinegar; after which they dry
them in the ſun, and keep them in boxes. Theſe flies, thus dried, being
chymically ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſed, yield a great deal of volatile cauſtic-ſalt, mixed
with a little oil, phlegm and earth. Cantharides are penetrating, corroſive,
and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſkin, raiſe bliſters, from whence proceeds a great
deal of ſeroſity. They are made uſe of both inwardly and outwardly.
However it is ſomewhat ſtrange that the effects of theſe flies ſhould
fall principally upon the urinary paſſages, for though ſome authors have
endeavoured to account for this, we are mill in the dark, for all they have
ſaid amounts to no more, than that they affect theſe parts in a manner
which may be very learnedly deſcribed, but very obſcurely comprehended.</p>
               <p>An inſect of great, tho' perhaps not equal uſe in medicine,
is that which is known by the name of the kermes; it is produced in the
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence of an oak, called the berry-bearing ilex, and appears at firſt
wrapt up in a membranaceous bladder, of the ſize of a pea, ſmooth and
ſhining of a browniſh red colour, and covered with a very fine
aſh-coloured pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0824000108:142"/> This bag teems with a number of
reddiſh eggs or inſects, which being rubbed with the fingers pour out a
crimſon liquor. It is only met with in warm countries in the months of May
and June. In the month of April this inſect becomes of the ſize and ſhape
of a pea, and its eggs ſome time after burſt from the womb, and ſoon
turning worms, run about the branches and leaves of the tree. They are of two
ſexes, and the females have been hitherto deſcribed; but the males are very
diſtinct from the former, and are a ſort of ſmall flies like gnats, with
ſix feet, of which the four forward are ſhort, and the two backward long,
divided into four joints, and armed with three crooked nails. There are two
feelers on the head, a line and a half long, which are moveable, ſtreaked and
articulated. The tail, at the back part of the body, is half a line long, and
forked. The whole body is covered with two tranſparent wings, and they leap
about in the manner of fleas. The har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of the kermes is greater or leſs
in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſeverity of the winter, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men gather them
before ſun-riſing, tearing them off with their nails; for fear there
ſhould be any loſs from the hatching of the inſects. They ſprinkle them
with vinegar, and lay them in the ſun to dry, where they acquire a red
colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0824000108:143"/>An inſect, perhaps, ſtill more
uſeful than, either of the former, is the cochineal, which has been very
variouſly deſcribed by authors; ſome have ſuppoſed it a vegetable
excreſcence from the tree upon which it is found; ſome have deſcribed it
as a louſe, ſome as a bug, and ſome as a beetle. As they appear in our
ſhops when brought from America, they are of an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſhape, convex on
one ſide, and a little concave on the other; but are both marked with
tranſverſe ſtreaks or wrinkles. They are of a ſcarlet colour within,
and without of a blackiſh red, and ſometimes of a white, reddiſh, or
aſh-colour, which are accounted the beſt, and are brought to us from
Mexico. The cochineal inſect is of an oval form, of the ſize of a ſmall
pea, with ſix feet, and a ſnout or trunk. It brings forth its young alive,
and is nouriſhed by ſucking the juice of the plant. Its body conſiſts
of ſeveral rings, and when it is once fixed on the plant, it continues
immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, being ſubject to no change. Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend there are two ſorts,
the one domeſtic, which is beſt, and the other wild, that is of a vivid
colour; however they appear to be the ſame, only with this difference, that
the Wild feeds upon uncultivated trees, without any aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whereas
the domeſtic is carefully at a <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0824000108:144"/> ſtated ſeaſon,
removed to cultivated trees, where it feeds upon a purer juice. Thoſe who
take care of theſe inſects, place them on the prickly pear plant in a
certain order, and are very induſtrious in defending them from other
inſects; for if any other kind come among them, they take care to bruſh
them off with foxes tails. Towards the end of the year, when the rains and cold
weather are coming on, which are fatal to theſe inſects, they take off the
leaves or branches covered with cochineal, that have not attained their
utmoſt degree of perfection, and keep them in their houſes till winter is
paſt. Theſe leaves are very thick and juicy, and ſupply them with
ſufficient nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while they remain within doors. When the milder
weather returns, and theſe animals are about to exclude their young, the
natives make them neſts, like thoſe of birds, but leſs, of tree-moſs,
or ſoft hay, or the down of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa-nuts, placing twelve in every neſt.
Theſe they fix on the thorns of the prickly pear-plant, and in three or four
days time they bring forth their young, which leave their neſts in a few
days, and creep upon the branches of the plant, till they find a proper place
to reſt in, and take in their nouriſhment; and until the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males are
ſecundated by the males, which, as <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0824000108:145"/> in the former
tribe, differ very widely, from the females being winged inſects, whereas the
others only creep, and are at moſt ſtationary. When they are impregnated,
they produce a new offspring, so that the propagator has a new harveſt thrice
a year. When the native Americans have gathered the cochineal, they put them
into holes in the ground, where they kill them with boiling water, and
afterwards dry them in the ſun, or in an oven, or lay them upon hot plates.
From the various me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of killing them, ariſe the different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours which
they appear in when brought to us. While they are living, they ſeem to be
ſprinkled over with a white powder, which they loſe as ſoon as the
boiling water is poured upon them. Thoſe that are dried upon hot places are
the blackeſt. What we call the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chineal are only the females, for the males
are a ſort of fly as already obſerved in the kermes. They are uſed both
for dyeing and medicine, and are ſaid to have much the ſame virtue as the
ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, tho' they are now ſeldom uſed alone, but are mixed with other
things for the ſake of the colour.</p>
               <p>I shall end this account of the beetle tribe with the hiſtory
of an animal which cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ranked under this ſpecies, and yet
which cannot be more methodically ranged under <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0824000108:146"/> any
other. This is the inſect that forms and reſides in the gall-nut, the
ſpoils of which are converted to ſuch uſeful purpoſes. The gall
inſects are bred in a ſort of bodies adhering to a kind of oak in Aſia,
which differ with regard to their colour, ſize, roughneſs, ſmoothneſs
and ſhape, and which we call galls. They are not fruit, as ſome have
imagined, but preternatural tumours, owing to the wounds given to the buds,
leaves, and twigs of the tree, by a kind of inſects that lay their eggs
within them. This animal is furniſhed with an implement, by which the female
penetrates into the bark of the tree, or into that ſpot which juſt begins
to bud, and there ſheds a drop of corroſive fluid into the cavity. Having
thus formed a recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for her eggs, ſhe depoſites them in the place,
and dies ſoon after. The heart of the bud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus wounded, the
circulation of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive juice is interrupted and the fermentation
thereof, with the poiſon injected by the fly, burns the parts adjacent, and
then alters the natural colour of the plant. The juice or ſap turned bark
from its natural courſe, extravaſates and flows round the egg. After which
it ſwells and dilates by the aſſiſtance of ſome bubbles of air, which
get admiſſion through the pores of the bark, and which run in the
veſſels with the ſap. <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0824000108:147"/> The external coat of this
excreſcence is dried by the air, and grows into a figure which bears ſome
reſemblance to the bow of an arch, or the roundneſs of a kernel. This
little ball receives its nutriment, growth and vegetation as the other parts of
the tree by ſlow degrees, and is what we call the gall-nut. The worm that is
hatched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this ſpacious vault, finds in the ſubſtance of the ball,
which is as yet very tender, a ſubſiſtence ſuitable to its nature;
gnaws and digeſts it till the time comes for its tranſformation to a nymph,
and from that ſtate of exiſtence changes into a fly. After this the
inſect, perceiving it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf duly provided with all things requiſite,
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engages itſelf ſoon from its confinement, and takes its flight into
the open air. The caſe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is not ſimilar with reſpect to the
gall-nut, that grows in autumn. The cold weather fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently comes on before
the worm is tranſform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a fly, or before the fly can pierce through its
incloſure. The nut falls with the leaves, and altho' you may imagine that the
fly which lies within is loſt, yet in reality it is not ſo; on the
contrary, its being covered up ſo cloſe, is the means of its
preſervation. Thus it ſpends the winter in a warm houſe, where every
crack and cranny of the nut is well ſtopped up; and lies buried as it were
under a heap of leaves, <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0824000108:148"/> which preſerves it from the
injuries of the weather. This apartment, however, tho' ſo commodious a
retreat in the winter, is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect priſon in the ſpring. The fly, rouzed
out of its lethargy by the firſt heats, breaks its way through, and ranges
where it pleaſes. A very ſmall aperture is ſufficient ſince at this
time the fly is but a diminutive crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Beſides, the ringlets whereof its
body is compoſed, dilate, and become pliant is the paſſage.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of the Gnat and the Tipula.</head>
               <p>THERE are two inſects which entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble each other in
their form, and yet widely differ in their habits, manners and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thoſe who have ſeen the tipula, or long-legs, and the larger kind of gnat,
have moſt probably miſtaken the one for the other, they have often
accuſed the tipula, a harmleſs inſect, of depredations made by the gnat,
and the innocent have ſuffered for the guilty; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the differences in
their form are ſo very minute, that it often requires the aſſiſtance of
a microſcope to diſtinguiſh the one from the other: they are both mounted
on long legs, both furniſhed with two wings and a ſlender body; their heads
are large, and they ſeem to be hump-backed; the chief and only difference,
therefore, is, that the tipula wants a trunk, while the gnat has a large one,
which it often exerts to very miſchievous purpoſes. The tipula is a
harmleſs peaceful inſect, that offers injury to nothing; the gnat is
ſanguinary and <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0824000108:150"/> predaceous, ever ſeeking out for a
place in which to bury its trunk, and pumping up the blood from the animal in
large quantities.</p>
               <p>The gnat proceeds from a little worm, which is uſually ſeen
at the bottom of ſtanding waters. The manner in which the inſect lays its
eggs is particularly curious; after having laid the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per number on the
ſurface of the water, it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds them with a kind of unctuous matter,
which prevents them from ſinking; but at the ſame time faſtens them with
a thread to the bottom, to prevent their floating away, at the mercy of every
breeze, from a place the warmth of which is proper for their production, to any
other, where the water may be too cold, or the animals its enemies too
numerous. Thus the inſects, in their egg ſtate, reſemble a buoy, which is
fixed by an anchor. As they come to maturity they ſink deeper, and at laſt,
when they leave the egg as worms they creep at the bottom. They now make
themſelves lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of cement, which they faſten to ſome ſolid body
at the very bottom of the water, unleſs, by accident, they meet with a piece
of chalk, which being of a ſoft and pliant nature, gives them an opportunity
of ſinking a retreat for themſelves, where nothing but the claws of a
cray-fiſh can poſſibly moleſt them. The worm <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0824000108:151"/>
afterwards changes its form. It appears with a large head, and a tail
inveſted with hair, and moiſtened with an oleaginous liquor, which ſhe
makes uſe of as a cork, to ſuſtain her head in the air, and her tail in
the water, and to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport her from one place to another. When the oil with
which her tail is moiſtened begins to grow dry, ſhe diſcharges out of her
mouth an unctuous humour, which ſhe ſheds all over her tail, by virtue
whereof, ſhe is enabled to-tranſport herſelf where ſhe pleaſes,
without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either wet or any ways incommoded by the water. The gnat, in her
ſecond ſtate, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, in her form of a nymph, which is an
introduction, or entrance into a new life. In the firſt place, the diverts
herſelf of her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſkin; in the next ſhe reſigns her eyes, her
antennae, and her tail; in ſhort, ſhe actually ſeems to expire. However,
from the ſpoils of the amphibious animal, a little winged inſect cuts the
air, whoſe every part is active to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and whoſe whole
ſtructure is the juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our admiration. Its little head is
adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a plume of feathers, and its whole body inveſted with ſcales
and hair, to ſecure it from any wet or duſt. She makes trial of the
activity of her wings, by rubbing them either againſt her body, or her broad
ſide-bags, <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0824000108:152"/> which keep her in an equilibrium. The
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>below, or little border of fine feathers, which graces her wings is very
curious, and ſtrikes the eye in the moſt agreeable manner. There is
nothing, however, of greater importance to the gnat, than her trunk, and that
weak imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may juſtly be deemed one of nature's maſter-pieces. It is
ſo very ſmall, that the extremity of it can ſcarcely be diſcerned
through the beſt microſcope that can be procured. That part which is at
firſt obvious to the eye, is nothing but a long ſcaly ſheath under the
throat. At near the diſtance of two thirds of it, there is an aperture,
through which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect darts out four ſtings, and afterwards retracts
them. One of which, however ſharp and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive it may be, is no more than the
caſe in which the other three lie concealed, and run in a long groove. The
ſides of theſe ſtings are ſharpened like two-edged ſwords; they are
likewiſe barbed, and have a vaſt number of cutting teeth towards the point,
which turns up like a hook, and is fine beyond expreſſion. When all theſe
darts are ſtuck into the fleſh of animals, ſometimes one after another,
and ſometimes all at once, the blood and humours of the adjacent parts muſt
unavoidably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated; upon which a tumour muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently 
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0824000108:153"/> enſue, the little orifice whereof is cloſed up by
the compreſſion of the external air. When the gnat, by the point of her
caſe, which ſhe makes uſe of as a tongue, has taſted any fruit,
fleſh, or juice, that ſhe has found out; if it be a fluid, ſhe ſucks it
up, without play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her darts into it; but in caſe ſhe finds the leaſt
obſtruction by any fleſh whatever, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts her ſtrength, and
pierces through it, if poſſibly ſhe can. After this ſhe draws back her
ſtings into their ſheath, which ſhe applies to the wound in order to
extract, as through a reed, the juices which ſhe finds incloſed. This is
the implement with which the gnat performs her work in the ſummer, for during
the winter the has no manner of occaſion for it. Then ſhe ceaſes to eat,
and ſpends all that tedious ſeaſon either in quarries or in caverns,
which ſhe abandons at the return of ſummer, and flies about in ſearch
after ſome commodious ford, or ſtanding water, where ſhe may produce her
progeny, which would be ſoon waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and loſt, by the too rapid
motion of any running ſtream. The little brood are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo
numerous, that the very water is tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged according to the colour of the
ſpecies, as green, if they be green, and of a ſanguine hue, if they be
red.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0824000108:154"/>Theſe are circumſtances ſufficiently
extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in the life of this little animal, but it offers ſomething
ſtill more curious in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of its propagation. However ſimilar
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects of the gnat kind are in their appearance, yet they differ widely
from each other in the manner in which they are brought forth, for ſome are
ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous, and are produced from eggs, ſome are viviparous, and come forth
in their moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect form; ſome are males, and unite with the female;
ſome are females, requiring the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation of the male; ſome are of
neither ſex, yet ſtill produce young, without any copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation whatſoever.
This is one of the ſtrangeſt diſcoveries in all natural hiſtory! A gnat
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the reſt of its kind, and incloſed in a glaſs
veſſel, with air ſufficient to keep it alive, ſhall produce young,
which alſo, when ſeparated from each other, ſhall be the parents of a
numerous progeny. Thus, down for five or ſix generations do theſe
extraordinary animals propagate without the uſe of copulation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any
congreſs between the male and female, but in the manner of vegetables, the
young burſting from the body of their parents, without any previous
impregnation. At the ſixth genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion however, their propagation ſtops,
the gnat no longer produces its like, from itſelf <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0824000108:155"/>
alone, but it requires the acceſs of the male to give it another

               <p>The gnat of Europe gives but little uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; it is
ſometimes heard to hum about our beds at night, and keeps off the approaches
of ſleep by the apprehenſion it cauſes; but it is very different in the
ill-peopled regions of America, where the waters ſtagnate, and the climate is
warm, and where they are produced in multitudes beyond expreſſion. The
whole air is there filled with clouds of thoſe famiſhed inſects; and they
are found of all ſizes, from ſix inches long, to a minuteneſs that even
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the microſcope to have a diſtinct percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. The warmth
of the mid-day ſun is too powerful for their conſtitutions; but when the
evening approaches, neither art nor flight can ſhield the wretched
inhabitants from their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks, tho' millions are deſtroyed, ſtill
millions more ſucceed, and produce unceaſing torment. The native Indians,
who anoint their bodies with oil, and who have from their infancy been uſed
to their depredations, find them much leſs inconvenient than thoſe who are
newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Europe; they ſleep in their cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages covered all over
with thouſands of the gnat kind upon their bodies, and yet do not ſeem to
have their ſlumbers interrupted by <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0824000108:156"/> their cruel
devourers. If a candle happens to be lighted in one of thoſe places, a cloud
of inſects at once light upon the flame, and extinguiſh it; they are
therefore obliged to keep their candles in glaſs lanthorns; a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
expedient to prevent an unceaſing calamity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of Zoophytes in General.</head>
               <p>WE are now come to the laſt link in the chain of animated
nature, to a claſs of beings ſo confined in their powers, and ſo
defective in their formation, that ſome hiſtorians have been at a loſs
whether to conſider them as a ſuperior rank of vegetables, or the
humbleſt order of the animated tribe. In order therefore to give them a
denomination, agreeable to their exiſtence, they have been called Zoophytes,
a name implying vegetable nature indued with animal life; and indeed, in ſome
the marks of the animal are ſo few, that it is difficult to give their place
in nature with preciſion, or to tell whether it is a plant or an inſect
that is the object of our conſideration.</p>
               <p>Should it be aſked what it is that conſtitutes the
difference between animal and vegetable life, what it is that lays the line
that ſeparates thoſe two great kingdoms from each other, it would be
difficult, perhaps we ſhould find it impoſſible, to return an anſwer.
The power of motion cannot form this diſtinction, ſince ſome vegetables
are poſſeſt of motion, and <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0824000108:159"/> many animals are
totally without it. The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive plant has obviouſly a greater variety
of motions than the oyſter or the pholas. The animal that fills the
acorn-ſhell is immoveable, and can only cloſe its lid to defend itſelf
from external injury, while the flower, which goes by the name of the fly-trap,
ſeems to cloſe upon the flies that light upon it, and that attempt to rifle
it of its honey. The animal in this inſtance, ſeems to have ſcarce a
power of ſelf defence; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable not only guards its
poſſeſſions, but ſeizes upon the robber that would venture to invade
them. In like manner, the methods of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion give no ſuperiority to the
lower rank of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. On the contrary, vegetables are frequently produced
more conformably to the higher ranks of the creation, and though ſome plants
are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by cuttings from others, yet the general manner of propagation is
from ſeeds, laid in the womb of the earth, where they are hatched into the
ſimilitude of the parent plant or flower. But a moſt numerous tribe of
animals have lately been diſcovered, which are propagated by cuttings, and
this in ſo extraordinary a manner, that, though the original inſect be
divided into a thouſand parts, each, however ſmall, ſhall be formed into
an animal, entirely reſembling that which was at firſt divided; in this
reſpect, <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0824000108:160"/> therefore, certain races of animals ſeem to
fall beneath vegetables, by their more imperfect propagation.</p>
               <p>What, therefore, is the diſtinction between them, or are the
orders ſo intimately blended as that it is impoſſible to mark the
boundaries of each? To me it would ſeem, that all animals are
poſſeſſed of one power, of which vegetables are totally deficient; I
mean either the actual ability, or an aukward attempt at
ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. However vegetables may ſeem poſſeſſed of this
important quality, yet it is with them but a mechanical impulſe, reſembling
the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one end of the lever, when you depreſs the other: the
ſenſitive plant contracts and hangs its leaves, indeed, when touched, but
this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no way contributes to its ſafety; the fly-trap flower acts
entirely in the ſame manner; and though it ſeems to ſeize the little
animal, that comes to annoy it, yet, in reality, only cloſes mechanically
upon it, and this incloſure neither contributes to its preſervation nor its
defence. But it is very different with inſects, even of the loweſt order;
the earth-worm not only contracts, but hides itſelf in the earth, and
eſcapes with force ſhare of ſwiftneſs from its purſuers. The polypus
hides its horns; the ſtar-fiſh contracts its arms, upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance 
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0824000108:161"/> even of diſtant dangers; they not only hunt for their
food, but provide for their ſafety, and however imperfectly they may be
formed, yet ſtill they are in reality, placed many degrees above the
higheſt vegetable of the earth, and are poſſeſſed of many animal
functions, as well as thoſe that are more elaborately formed.</p>
               <p>But though theſe be ſuperior to plants, they are very far
beneath their animated fellows of exiſtence. In the claſs of zoophytes, we
may place all thoſe animals, which may be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by cuttings, or in
other words, which, if divided into two or more parts, each part in time,
becomes a ſeparate and perfect animal; the head ſhoots forth a tail, and on
the contrary, the tail produces a head; ſome of theſe will bear dividing,
but into two parts, ſuch is the earth-worm; ſome may be divided into more
than two, and of this kind are many of the ſtar fiſh; others ſtill may be
cut into a thouſand parts, each becoming a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect animal; they may be
turned inſide out, like the finger of a glove, they may be mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into all
manner of ſhapes, yet ſtill their vivacious principle remains, ſtill
every ſingle part becomes perfect in its kind, and after a few days
exiſtence, exhibits all the arts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0824000108:162"/> of
its contemptible parent! We ſhall, therefore, divide zoophytes according to
their ſeveral degrees of perfection, namely, into worms, ſtar-fiſh and
polypi; contenting our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a ſhort review of thoſe nauſeous and
deſpicable creatures, that excite our curioſity chiefly by their
imperfections; it muſt not be concealed, however, that much has of late been
written on this part of natural hiſtory. A new mode of animal production,
could not fail of exciting not only the curioſity, but the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of every philoſopher; many found their favourite ſyſtems totally
overthrown by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and it was not without a wordy ſtruggle, that
they gave up what had formerly been their pleaſure and their pride. At
laſt, however, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction became too ſtrong for argument, and a
queſtion, which owed its general ſpread rather to its novelty, than to its
importance, was given up in favour of the new diſcovery.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of Worms.</head>
               <p>THE firſt in the claſs of zoophytes, are animals of the worm
kind, which being entirely deſtitute of feet, trail themſelves along upon
the ground, and find themſelves a retreat under the earth, or in the water.
As theſe, like ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, have a creeping motion, ſo both, in general, go
under the common appellation of reptiles; a loathſome, noxious, malignant
tribe, to which man by nature, as well as by religion, has the ſtrongeſt
antipathy. But though worms, as well as ſerpents, are moſtly without feet,
and have been doomed to creep along the earth on their bellies, yet their
motions are very different. The ſerpent, as has been ſaid before, having a
back bone, which it is incapable of contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bends its body into the form
of a bow, and then ſhoots forward from the tail; but it is very different
with the worm, which has a power of contracting or lengthening itſelf at
will. There is a ſpiral muſcle, that runs round its whole body, from the
head to tail, ſomewhat reſembling a wire wound round a walking-cane, 
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0824000108:164"/> which, when ſlipped off, and one end extended and held
faſt, will bring the other nearer to it; in this manner the earth-worm,
having ſhot out, or extended its body, takes hold by the ſlime of the fore
part of its body, and ſo contracts and brings forward the hinder part; in
this manner it moves onward, not without great effort, but the occaſions for
its progreſſive motion are few.</p>
               <p>As it is deſigned for living under the earth, and leading a
life of obſcurity, ſo it ſeems toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably adapted to its ſituation. Its
body is armed with ſmall ſtiff ſharp burrs or prickles, which it can
erect or depreſs at pleaſure; under the ſkin there lies a ſlimy juice,
to be ejected as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion requires, at certain perforations, between the
rings of the muſces, to lubricate its body, and facilitate its paſſage
into the earth. Like moſt other inſects, it hath breathing-holes along the
back, adjoining each ring; but it is without bones, without eyes, without ears,
and, properly without feet. It has a mouth, and alſo an elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary canal,
which runs along to the very point of the tail. In ſome worms, however,
particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as are found in the bodies of animals, this canal opens
towards the middle of the belly, at ſome diſtance from the tail. The
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines of the earth-worm, are always found <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0824000108:165"/> filled
with a very fine earth, which ſeems to be the only nouriſhment theſe
animals are capable of receiving.</p>
               <p>The animal is entirely without brain, but near the head is
placed the heart, which is ſeen to beat with a very diſtinct motion, and
round it are the ſpermatic veſſels, forming a number of little globules,
containing a milky fluid, which have an opening into the belly, not far from
the head: they are alſo often found to contain a number of eggs, which are
laid in the earth, and are hatched in twelve or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days into life, by
the genial warmth of their ſituation; like ſnails, all theſe animals
unite in themſelves, both ſexes at once, the reptile that impregnates,
being impregnated in turn; few that walk out, but muſt have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them,
with their heads laid againſt each other, and ſo ſtrongly attached, that
they ſuffer themſelves to be trod upon.</p>
               <p>When the eggs are laid in the earth, which, in about fourteen
days, as has been ſaid, are hatched into maturity, the young ones come forth
very ſmall, but perfectly formed, and ſuffer no change during their
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence: how long their life continues is not well known, but it certainly
holds for more than two or three ſeaſons. During the winter, 
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0824000108:166"/> they bury themſelves deeper in the earth, and ſeem,
in ſome meaſure, to ſhare the general torpidity of the inſect tribe. In
ſpring, they revive with the reſt of nature, and on thoſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, a
moiſt or dewy evening brings them forth from their retreats, for the
univerſal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of continuing their kind. They chiefly live in a light
rich and fertile ſoil, moiſtened by dews or accidental ſhowers, but avoid
thoſe places where the water is apt to lie on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth, or
where the clay is too ſtiff for their eaſy progreſſion under
ground.</p>
               <p>Helpleſs as they are formed, yet they ſeem very vigilant in
avoiding thoſe animals that chiefly make them their prey; in particular, the
mole, who feeds entirely upon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſurface, and who ſeldom
ventures, from the dimneſs of its ſight, into the open air; him they avoid,
by darting up from the earth, the inſtant they feel the ground move; and
fiſhermen, who are well acquainted with this, take them in what numbers they
chuſe, by ſtirring the earth where they expect to find them. They are
alſo driven from their retreats under ground, by pouring bitter or acrid
water thereon, ſuch as that water in which green walnuts have been ſteeped,
or a lye made of pot-aſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0824000108:167"/>Such is the general outline of the
hiſtory of theſe reptiles, which, as it ſhould ſeem, degrades them no
way beneath the rank of other animals of the inſect creation; but we now come
to a part of their hiſtory, which proves the imperfection of their organs,
from the eaſineſs with which theſe little machines may be damaged and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired again. It is well known in mechanics, that the fineſt and moſt
complicated inſtruments are the moſt eaſily put out of order, and the
moſt difficultly ſet right; the ſame alſo obtains in the animal
machine. Man, the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated machine of all others, whoſe nerves are
more numerous, and powers of action more various, is moſt eaſily
deſtroyed: he is ſeen to die under wounds which a quadruped or a bird could
eaſily ſurvive; and as we deſcend gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the lower ranks, the
ruder the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the more difficult it is to diſarange it. Some
animals live without their limbs, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten are ſeen to reproduce them;
ſome are ſeen to live without their brain for many weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
caterpillars continue to increaſe and grow large, tho' all their nobler
organs are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtroyed within; ſome animals continue to exiſt,
though cut in two, their nobler parts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving life, while the others
periſh that were cut away; but the earth worm, and all the 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0824000108:168"/> zoophyte tribe, continue to live in ſeparate parts,
and one animal, by the means of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, is divided into two diſtinct
exiſtences, ſometimes into a thouſand.</p>
               <p>There is no phaenomenon in all natural hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry more
aſtoniſhing than this, that man, at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhould have a kind of
creative power, and out of one life make two, each compleatly formed, with all
its apparatus and functions, each with its perceptions, and powers of motion
and ſelf-preſervation, each as compleat in all reſpects as that from
which it derived its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and equally enjoying the humble
grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of its nature.</p>
               <p>When De Cartes firſt ſtarted the opinion, that brutes were
machines, the diſcovery of this ſurpriſing propagation was unknown, which
might, in ſome meaſure, have ſtrengthened his fanciful theory. What is
life, in brutes, he might have ſaid, or where does it reſide? In ſome we
find it ſo diffuſed, that every part ſeems to maintain a vivacious
principle, and the ſame animal appears poſſeſſed of a thouſand
diſtinct irrational ſouls at the ſame time. But let us not, he would
ſay, give ſo noble a name to ſuch contemptible powers, but rank the
vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying principle in theſe with the ſap that riſes in vegetables, or
the moiſture that contracts a <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0824000108:169"/> cord, or the heat that
puts water into motion! Nothing, in fact, deſerves the name of ſoul, but
that which reaſons, that which underſtands, and by knowing God, receives
the mark of its currency, and is minted with the impreſſion of its great
Creator.</p>
               <p>Sucb might have been the ſpeculations of this philoſopher,
however to leave theory, it will be ſufficient to ſay that we owe the
firſt diſcovery of this power of reproduction in animals to Mr. Trembley,
who firſt obſerved it in the polypus, and after him, Spalanzani and others
found it taking place in the earth-worm, the ſea-worm, and ſeveral other
ill-formed animals of a like kind, which were ſuſceptible of this new mode
of propagation. This laſt philoſopher, has tried ſeveral experiments upon
the earth-worm, many of which ſucceeded according to his expectation; every
earth-worm, however, did not retain the vivacious principle with the ſame
obſtinacy; ſome, when cut in two, were intirely deſtroyed; others
ſurvived only in the nobler part; and while the head was living the tail
entirely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and a new one was ſeen to burge on from the extremity.
But what was moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing of all, in ſome, particularly in the
ſmall red-headed earth worm, both extremities ſurvived the operation; the
head produced a <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0824000108:170"/> tail with the anus, the inteſtines,
the anular muſcles, and the prickly beards; the tail part, on the other hand,
was ſeen to ſhoot forth the nobler organs, and in leſs than the ſpace
of three months ſent forth a head, heart, with all the apparatus and
inſtruments of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. This part, as may eaſily be ſuppoſed, was
produced much more ſlowly than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, a new head taking above three or
four months for its completion, a new tail being ſhot forth in leſs than as
many weeks. Thus two animals, by diſſection, were made out of one, each
with their ſeparate appetites, each endued with life and motion, and
ſeemingly as perfect as that ſingle animal from whence they derived their
origin.</p>
               <p>What was performed upon the earth-worm, was found to obtain
alſo in many other of the vermicular ſpecies. The ſea-worm, the white
water-worm, and many of thoſe little worms with feelers, found at the bottom
of dirty ditches; in all theſe the nobler organs are of ſuch little uſe,
that if taken away, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal does not ſeem to feel the want of them; it
lives in all its parts, and in every part, and by a ſtrange paradox in
nature, the moſt uſeleſs and contemptible life is of all others the
moſt difficult to deſtroy.</p>

               <p>THE next order of zoophytes is that of the ſtar fiſh, a
numerous tribe, ſhapeleſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, aſſuming at different times
different appearances. The ſame animal that now appears round like a ball,
ſhortly after flattens as thin as a plate. All of this kind are formed of a
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-tranſparent gelatinous ſubſtance, covered with a thin membrane,
and, to an inattentive ſpectator, often appear like a lump of inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
jelly, floating at random upon the ſurface of the ſea, or thrown by chance
on ſhore at the departure of the tide. But upon a more minute inſpection,
they will be found poſſeſſed of life and motion; they will be found to
ſhoot forth their arms in every direction, in order to ſeize upon ſuch
inſects as are near, and to devour them with great rapacity. Worms, the
ſpawn of fiſh, and even muſcles themſelves, with their hard
reſiſting ſhell, have been found in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs of theſe voracious
animals; and what is very extraordinary, tho' the ſubſtance of their own

                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0824000108:173"/> theſe ſhells, which are
almoſt of a ſtony hardneſs. They increaſe in ſize as all other
ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals do. In ſummer, when the water of the ſea is warmed by the heat of
the ſun, they float upon the ſurface, and in the dark they ſend forth a
kind of ſhining light reſembling that of phoſphorus. Some have given
theſe animals the name of ſea-nettles, becauſe they burn the hands of
thoſe that touch them, as nettles are found to do. They are often ſeen
faſtened to the rocks, and to the largeſt ſea-ſhells, as if to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
their nouriſhment from them. If they be taken and put into ſpirit of wine,
they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for many years intire, but if they be left to the influence
of the air, they are, in leſs than four and twenty hours melted down into a
limpid and offenſive water.</p>
               <p>In all of this ſpecies, none are found to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs a
vent for their excrements, but the ſame paſſage by which they devour
their food, ſerves for the ejection of their faeces. Theſe animals as was
ſaid, take ſuch a variety of figures, that it is impoſſible to
deſcribe them under one deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate ſhape; but in general, their bodies
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a truncated cone, whoſe baſe is applied to the rock to which
they are found uſually attached. Tho' generally tranſparent, yet they are
found of different colours, ſome inclining to <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0824000108:174"/> green,
ſome to red, ſome to white, and ſome to brown. In ſome, their colours
appear dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed over the whole ſurface, in ſome, they are often
ſtreaked, and in others often ſpotted. They are poſſeſt of a very
ſlow progreſſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in fine weather, they are continually
ſeen, ſtretching out and fiſhing for their prey. Many of them are
poſſeſt of a number of long ſlender filaments, in which they entangle
any ſmall animals they happen to approach, and thus draw them into their
enormous ſtomachs, which fill the whole cavity of their bodies. The harder
ſhells continue for ſome weeks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted, but at length, they undergo a
kind of maceration in the ſtomach, and become a part of the ſubſtance of
the animal itſelf. The indigeſtible parts, are returned by the ſame
aperture by which they were ſwallowed, and then the ſtar-fiſh begins to
fiſh for more. Theſe alſo may be cut in pieces, and every part will
ſurvive the operation; each becoming a perfect animal, endued with its
natural rapacity. Of this tribe, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is various, and the deſcription
of each would be tedious and uninſtructing; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and nature of all,
are nearly as deſcribed; but I will juſt make mention of one creature,
which, tho' not properly belonging to this claſs, <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0824000108:175"/> yet
is ſo nearly related, that the paſſing it in ſilence would be an
unpardonable omiſſion.</p>
               <p>Of all other animals, the cuttle-fiſh, tho' in ſome
reſpect ſuperior to this tribe, poſſeſſes qualities the moſt
extraordinary. It is about two feet long, covered with a very thin ſkin, and
its fleſh compoſed of a gelatinous ſubſtance, which however within
ſide is ſtrengthened by a ſtrong bone, of which ſuch great uſe is
made by the goldſmiths. It is poſſeſſed of eight arms, which it
extends, and which are proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of ſervice to it in fiſhing for its prey;
while in life, it is capable of lengthening or contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe at
pleaſure; but when dead, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and loſe their rigidity. They feed
upon ſmall fiſh, which they ſeize with their arms; and they are bred from
eggs, which are laid upon the weeds along the ſea-ſhore.</p>
               <p>The cuttle fiſh is found along many of the coaſts of Europe,
but are not eaſily caught, from a contrivance with which they are
furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by nature; this is a black ſubſtance, of the colour of ink,
which is contained in a bladder generally on the left-ſide of the belly, and
which is ejected in the manner of an excrement from the anus. Whenever
therefore this fiſh is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and when it finds a difficulty of
eſcaping, it ſpurts forth a great quantity of this black 
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0824000108:176"/> liquor, by which the waters are totally darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and
then it eſcapes, by lying cloſe at the bottom. In this manner the creature
finds its ſafety, and men find ample cauſe for admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the great
variety of ſtratagems with which creatures are endued for their peculiar
preſervation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. Of the Polypus.</head>
               <p>THOSE animals which we have deſcribed in the laſt chapter,
are variouſly denominated. They have been called the Star-fiſh,
Sea-net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and Sea-polypi. This laſt name has been peculiarly aſcribed
to them by the ancients, becauſe of the number of feelers or feet of which
they are all poſſeſt, and with which they have a ſlow progreſſive
motion; but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns have given the name of Polypus, to a reptile that
lives in freſh water, by no means ſo large or obſervable. Theſe are
found at the bottom of wet ditches, or attached to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſurface of the
broad-leafed plants that grow and ſwim on the waters. The ſame difference
holds between theſe and the ſea-water polypus, as between all the
productions of the ſea, and of the land and the ocean. The marine vegetables
and animals grow to a monſtrous ſize. The eel, the pike, or the bream of
freſh-waters, is but ſmall; but in the ſea, they grow to an enormous
magnitude. The herbs of the field are at moſt but a few feet high; thoſe of
the ſea often ſhoot forth a ſtalk of a hundred. It is ſo between the
polypi of <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0824000108:178"/> both elements. Thoſe of the ſea are found
from two feet in length to three or four, and Pliny has even deſcribed one,
the arms of which were no leſs than thirty feet long. Thoſe in freſh
waters, however, are comparatively minute; at their utmoſt ſize, ſeldom
above three parts of an inch long, and when gathered up into their uſual
form, not above a third even of thoſe dimenſions.</p>
               <p>It was upon theſe minute animals, that the power of
diſſection was firſt tried in multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their numbers. They had been
long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as little worthy the attention of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and were
conſigned to that neglect in which thouſands of minute ſpecies of
inſects remain to this very day. It is true, indeed, that Reau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
obſerved, claſſed, and named them. By contemplating their motions, he was
enabled di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to pronounce on their being of the animal, and not of the
vegetable kingdom; and he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them Polypi, from their great reſemblance
to thoſe larger ones that were found in the ocean. Still, however, their
properties were neglected, and their hiſtory unknown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trembley was the perſon to whom we owe the firſt
diſcovery of the amazing properties and powers of this little vivacious
creature: He divided this claſs of animals into four different 
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0824000108:179"/> kinds; into thoſe inclining to green, thoſe of a
browniſh caſt, thoſe of fleſh-colour, thoſe which he calls the polype
dé panache. The differences of ſtructure in theſe, as alſo of
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, are obſervable enough; but the manner of their ſubſiſting, of
ſeizing their prey, and of their propagation, is pretty nearly the ſame in
all.</p>
               <p>Whoever has looked with care into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a wet ditch,
when the water is ſtagnant, and the ſun has been powerful, may remember to
have ſeen many little tranſparent lumps of jelly, about the ſize of a
pea, and flatted on one ſide; ſuch alſo as have examined the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſide of the broad-leafed weeds that grow on the ſurface of the water,
muſt have obſerved them ſtudded with a number of theſe little
jelly-like ſubſtances, which were probably then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded, becauſe
their nature and hiſtory was unknown. Theſe little ſubſtances however,
were no other than living polypi gathered up into a quieſcent ſtate and
ſeemingly inanimate, becauſe either diſturbed, or not excited by the
calls of appetite to action. When they are ſeen exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves they
put on a very different appearance from that when at reſt; to conceive a
juſt idea of their figure, we may ſuppoſe the finger of a glove cut off
at the bottom; we may <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0824000108:180"/> ſuppoſe alſo ſeveral
threads or horns plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round the edge like a fringe. The hollow of this
finger will give us an idea of the ſtomach of the animal, the threads
iſſuing forth from the edges may be conſidered as the arms or feelers,
with which it hunts for its prey. The animal, at its greateſt extent, is
ſeldom ſeen above an inch and a half long, but it is much ſhorter when it
is contracted and at reſt; it is furniſhed neither with muſcles nor
rings, and its manner of length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening or contracting itſelf, more reſembles
that of the ſnail, than worms, or any other inſect. The polypus contracts
itſelf more or leſs, in proportion as it is touched, or as the water is
agitated in which they are ſeen. Warmth ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates them, and cold benumbs
them; but it requires a degree of cold approaching conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation before they are
reduced to perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity; thoſe of an inch have generally their arms
double, often thrice as long as their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The arms, where the animal is
not diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſeaſon not unfavourable, are thrown about in
various directions, in order to ſeize and entangle its little prey;
ſometimes three or four of the arms are thus employed, while the reſt are
contracted like the horns of a ſnail, within the animal's body. It ſeems
capable of giving what length it pleaſes to theſe arms; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts 
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0824000108:181"/> and extends them at pleaſure, and ſtretches them
only in proportion to the remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the object it would ſeize.</p>
               <p>Theſe animals have a progreſſive motion, which is
performed by that power they have of lengthening and contracting themſelves
at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; they go from one part of the bottom to another; they mount
along the margin of the water, and climb up the ſide of aquatic plants. They
often are ſeen to come to the ſurface of the water, where they ſuſpend
themſelves by their lower end. As they advance but very ſlowly, they employ
a great deal of time in every action, and bind themſelves very ſtrongly to
whatever body they chance to move upon as they proceed; their adheſion is
voluntary, and is probably performed in the manner of a cupping glaſs
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the body.</p>
               <p>All animals of this kind have a remarkable attachment to turn
towards the light, and this naturally might induce an enquirer to look for
their eyes; but however carefully this ſearch has been purſued, and however
excellent the microſcope with which every part was examined yet nothing of
the appearance of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan was found over the whole body; and it is moſt
probable that, like ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſects which hunt their prey by their 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0824000108:182"/> feeling, theſe creatures are unfurniſhed with
advantages which would be totally uſeleſs for their ſupport.</p>
               <p>In the center of the arms, as was ſaid before, the mouth is
placed, which the animal can open and ſhut at pleaſure, and this ſerves
at once as a paſſage for food, and an opening for it after digeſtion. The
inward part of the animal's body ſeems to be one great ſtomach, which is
open at both ends; but the purpoſes which the opening at the bottom ſerves
are hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, but certainly not for excluding their excrements, for
thoſe are ejected at the aperture by which they are taken in. If the
ſurface of the body of this little creature be examined with a microſcope,
it will be found ſtudded with a number of warts, as alſo the arms,
eſpecially when they are contracted; and theſe tubercles, as we ſhall
preſently ſee, anſwer a very important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>If we examine their way of living, we ſhall find theſe
inſects chiefly ſubſiſting upon others, much leſs than themſelves,
particularly a kind of millepedes that live in the water, and a very ſmall
red worm, which they ſeize with great avidity. In ſhort, no inſect
whatſoever, leſs than themſelves, ſeems to come amiſs to them; their
arms, as was obſerved above, ſerve them as a <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0824000108:183"/> net
would a fiſherman, or perhaps more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſpeaking, as a lime-twig does a
fowler. Wherever their prey is perceived, which the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal effects by its
feeling, it is ſufficient to touch the object it would ſeize upon and it is
faſtened, without a power of eſcaping. The inſtant one of this inſect's
long arms is laid upon a millepede, the little inſect ſticks without a
poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating. The greater the diſtance at which it is
touched, the greater is the eaſe with which the Polypus brings the prey to
its mouth. If the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle object be near, tho' irretrievably caught, it is not
without great difficulty that it can be brought to the mouth and ſwallowed.
When the Polypus is unſupplied with prey, it teſtifies its hunger by
opening its mouth; the aperture, however, is ſo ſmall that it cannot be
eaſily perceived; but when, with any of its long arms, it has ſeized upon
its prey, it then opens the mouth diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, and this opening is
always in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the ſize of the animal which it would ſwallow; the
lips dilate inſenſibly by ſmall degrees, and adjuſt themſelves
preciſely to the figure of their prey. Mr. Trembley, who took a pleaſure in
feeding this uſeleſs brood, found that they could devour aliments of every
kind, fiſh and fleſh as well as inſects; but he owns they did not thrive
ſo well upon beef and <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0824000108:184"/> veal, as upon the little worms
of their own provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. When he gave one of theſe famiſhed rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles any
ſubſtance which was improper to ſerve for aliment, at firſt it ſeized
the prey with avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, but after keeping it ſome time entangled near the
mouth, it let drop again with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing nicety.</p>
               <p>When ſeveral polypi happen to fall upon the ſame worm, they
diſpute their common prey with each other. Two of them are often ſeen
ſeizing the ſame worm at different ends, and dragging it at oppoſie
directions with great force. It often happens that while one is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
its reſpective end, the other is alſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſame manner, and
thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſwallowing each his part, until their mouths meet
together; they then reſt, each for ſome time in this ſituation, till the
worm breaks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and each goes off with his ſhare; but it often
happens, that a ſeemingly more dangerous combat enſues, when the mouths of
both are thus joined upon one common prey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: the largeſt polypus then
gapes and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his antagoniſt; but what is very wonderful, the animal
thus ſwallowed ſeems to be rather a gainer by the misfortune. After it has
lain in the conquerors body for about an hour, it iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues unhurt, and often
in poſſeſſion of the prey <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0824000108:185"/> which had been the
original cauſe of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; how happy would it be for men, if they had as
little to fear from each other!</p>
               <p>Theſe reptiles continue eating the whole year, except when the
cold approaches to congelation; and then, like moſt others of the inſect
tribe, they feel the general torpor of nature, and all their faculties are for
two or three months ſuſpended; but if they abſtain at one time, they are
equally voracious at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and like ſnakes, ants, and other animals that
are torpid in winter, the meal of one day ſufficies them for ſeveral months
together. In general, however, they devour more largely in proportion to their
ſize, and their growth is quick exactly as they are fed; ſuch as are beſt
ſupplied, ſooneſt acquire their largeſt ſize, but they diminiſh
alſo in their growth with the ſame facility, if their food be taken
away.</p>
               <p>Such are the more obvious properties of theſe little animals,
but the moſt wonderful ſtill remain behind: Their manner of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
or rather multiplication, has for ſome years been the aſtoniſhment of all
the learned of Europe. They are produced in as great a variety of manners as
every ſpecies of vegetable. Some polypi are propagated from eggs, as plants
are from their ſeed; <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0824000108:186"/> ſome are produced by buds
iſſuing from their bodies, as plants are produced by inoculation, while all
may be multiplied by cuttings, and this to a degree of minuteneſs that
exceeds even philoſophical perſeverance.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to ſuch of this kind as are hatched from the
egg little curious can be added, as it is a method of propagation ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all the tribes of inſect nature; but with regard to ſuch as are produced
like buds from their parent ſtem, or like cuttings from an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal root,
their hiſtory requires a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed explanation. If a polypus be
carefully obſerved in ſummer, when theſe animals are chiefly active, and
more particularly prepared for propagation, it will be found to burgeon forth
from different parts of its body ſeveral tubercles or little knobs, which
grow larger and larger every day; after two or three days inſpection, what at
firſt appeared but a ſmall excreſcence takes the figure of a ſmall
animal, entirely reſembling its parent, furniſhed with feelers, a mouth,
and all the apparatus for ſeizing and digeſting its prey. This little
crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture every day becomes larger, like the parent, to which it continues
attached; it ſpreads its arms to ſeize upon whatever inſect is proper for
aliment, and devours it for its own <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0824000108:187"/> particular benefit;
thus it is poſſeſſed of two ſources of nouriſhment, that which it
receives from the parent by the tail, and that which it receives from its own
induſtry by the mouth. The food which theſe animals receive often tinctures
the whole body, and upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the parent is often ſeen
communicating a part of its own fluids to that of its progeny that grows upon
it; while, on the contrary, it never receives any tincture, from any
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that is caught and ſwallowed by its young. If the parent
ſwallows a red worm, which gives a tincture to all its fluids, the young one
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the parental colour; but if the latter ſhould ſeize upon the
ſame prey, the parent polypus is no way benefited by the capture, but all the
advantage remains with the young one.</p>
               <p>But we are not to ſuppoſe that the parent is capable of
producing only one at a time, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral young ones are thus ſeen at once, of
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſizes, growing from its body, ſome juſt budding forth, others
acquiring their perfect form, and others come to ſufficient maturity, and
juſt ready to drop from the original ſtem to which they had been attached
for ſeveral days. But what is more extraordinary ſtill, thoſe young ones
themſelves that continue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0824000108:188"/> to their parent,
are ſeen to burgeon, and propagate their own young ones alſo, each holding
the ſame dependance upon its reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive parent, and poſſeſſed of
the ſame advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that have been already deſcribed in the firſt
connection. Thus we ſee a ſurprizing chain of exiſtence continued, and
numbers of animals naturally produced without any union of the ſexes, or
other previous diſpoſition of nature.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to be the moſt natural way by which theſe
inſects are multiplied; their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction from the egg being not ſo common;
and tho' ſome of this kind are found with a little bladder attached to their
bodies, which is ſuppoſed to be filled with eggs, which afterwards come to
maturity, yet the artificial method of propagating theſe animals, is much
more expeditious and equally certain: It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different whether one of them be
cut into ten, or ten hundred parts, each becomes as perfect an animal as that
which was originally divided, but it muſt be obſerved, that the ſmaller
the part which is thus ſeparated from the reſt, the longer it will be in
coming to maturity, or in aſſuming its perfect form. It would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to recount the many experiments that have been tried upon this philoſophical
prodigy; <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0824000108:189"/> the animal has been twiſted, and turned into
all manner of ſhapes; it has been turned inſide out, it has been cut in
every diviſion, yet ſtill it continued to move; its parts adapted
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again to each other, and in a ſhort time it became as voracious
and induſtrious as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe kinds mentioned by Mr.Tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, there are
various others which have been lately diſcovered by the vigilance of
ſucceeding obſervers, and ſome of theſe ſo ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a
flowering vegetable in their forms, that they have been miſtaken by many
natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts for ſuch. Mr. Hughes, the author of the Natural Hiſtory of
Barbadoes, has deſcribed a ſpecies of this animal, but has miſtaken its
nature, and called it a ſenſitive flowering plant; he obſerved it to take
refuge in the holes of rocks, and when undiſturbed, to ſpread forth a
number of ramifications, each terminated by a flowery petal which ſhrunk at
the approach of the hand, and withdrew into the hole from whence before it had
been ſeen to iſſue. This plant however was no other than an animal of the
polypus kind, which is not only to be found in Barbadoes, but alſo on many
parts of the coaſt of Cornwall, and along the ſhores of the Continent.</p>

               <p>IT is very probable that the animals we ſee, and are
acquainted with, bear no manner of proportion to thoſe that are concealed
from us. Although every leaf and vegetable ſwarms with animals upon land, yet

formation of inſects, palaces which they have built for their own

Theſe aquatic groves are formed of different ſubſtances, and aſſume
various appearances. The coral-plants, as they are called, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhoot
out like trees without leaves in winter; they often ſpread out a broad
ſurface like a fan, and not uncommonly a large bund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling head, like a faggot;
ſometimes they are found to reſemble a plant with leaves and flowers; and
often the antlers of a ſtag, with great exactneſs and regularity. In other
parts of the ſea are ſeen ſponges of various magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and
extraordinary appearances, aſſuming a variety of phantaſtic forms like
large muſhrooms, mitres, fonts and flower-pots. To an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſpectator
theſe various productions ſeem intirely of the vegetable kind; they ſeem
to have their leaves and their flowers, and have been experimentally known to
ſhoot out branches in the compaſs of a year. Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, therefore,
till of late, thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pretty ſecure in aſcribing theſe
producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the vegetable kingdom; and Count Marſigli, who has written
very laboriouſly and learnedly upon the ſubject of corals and ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
has not heſitated to declare his opinion, that they were plants of the
aquatic kind, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0824000108:193"/> with flowers and ſeed, and
endued with a vegetation intirely reſembling that which is found upon land.
This opinion, however, ſome time after, began to be ſhaken by Rumphius and
Juſſieu, and at laſt by the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mr. Ellis who by a more
ſagacious and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enquiry into nature, put it paſt doubt, that corals
and ſponges were entirely the work of animals and that like the honey-comb,
which was formed by the bee, the coral was the work of an infinite number of
reptiles of the polypus kind, whoſe united labours were thus capable of
filling whole tracts of the ocean with thoſe embarraſſing tokens of their
induſtry.</p>
               <p>If in our reſearches after the nature of theſe plants, we
ſhould be induced to break off a branch of the coraline ſubſtance, and
obſerve it carefully, we ſhall perceive its whole ſurface, which is very
rugged and irregular, covered with a mucous fluid, and almoſt in every part
ſtudded with little jelly-like drops, which when cloſely examined, will be
found to be no other than reptiles of the polypus kind. Theſe have their
motions, their arms, their appetites, exactly reſembling thoſe deſcribed
in the laſt chapter, but they ſoon expire when taken out of the ſea, and
our curioſity is at once ſtopped in its <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0824000108:194"/> career, by
the animals ceaſing to give any marks of their induſtry; recourſe
therefore has been had to other expedients, in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the nature
of the inhabitant, as well as the habitation.</p>
               <p>If a coraline plant be ſtrictly obſerved, while ſtill
growing in the ſea, and the animals upon its ſurface be not diſturbed,
either by the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the waters, or the touch of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, the
little polypi will then be ſeen in infinite numbers, each iſſuing from
its cell, and in ſome kinds, the head covered with a little ſhell,
reſembling an umbrella, the arms ſpread abroad, in order to ſeize its
prey, while the hinder part ſtill remains attached to its habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from
whence it never wholly removes. By this time it is perceived that the number of
inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants is infinitely greater than was at firſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; that
they are all aſſiduouſly employed in the ſame purſuits, and that they
iſſue from their reſpective cells, and retire into them at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
Still, however, there are no proofs that thoſe large branches which they
inhabit are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the conſtruction of ſuch feeble and minute animals.
But chemiſtry will be found to lend a clue to extricate us from our doubts in
this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Like the ſhells which are formed by <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0824000108:195"/>
ſnails, muſcles and oyſters, theſe cora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſubſtances
efferveſce with acids, and may therefore well be ſuppoſed to partake of
the ſame animal nature. But Mr. Ellis went ſtill farther, and examined
their operations, juſt as they were beginning. Obſerving an oyſter-bed
which had been for ſome time neglected, he there perceived the firſt
rudiments of a coraline plantation, and tufts of various kinds ſhooting from
different parts of this favourable ſoil. It was upon theſe he tried his
principal experiment. He took out the oyſters which were thus furniſhed
with cora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and placed them in a large wooden veſſel, covering them
with ſea-water. In about an hour, he perceived the animals, which before had
been contracted by handling, and had ſhewn no ſigns of life, expanding
themſelves in every direction, and appearing employed in their own natural
manner. Perceiving them therefore in this ſtate, his next aim was to
preſerve them thus expanded, ſo as to be permanent objects of curioſity.
For this purpoſe he poured, by ſlow degrees, an equal quantity of
boiling-water into the veſſel of ſea water in which they were immerſed.
He then ſeparated each polypus with pincers from its ſhell, and plunged
each ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately into ſmall chryſtal vaſes, filled with ſpirit 
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0824000108:196"/> of wine mixed with water. By this means, the animal was
preſerved entire, without having time to contract itſelf, and he thus
perceived a variety of kinds, almoſt equal to that variety of productions
which theſe little animals are ſeen to form. He has been thus able to
perceive and deſcribe fifty different kinds, each of which is ſeen to
poſſeſs its own peculiar mode of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and to form a coraline
that none of the reſt can imitate. It is true indeed, than on every coraline
ſubſtance there are a number of polypi found, no way reſembling thoſe
which are the erectors of the building; theſe may be called a vagabond race
of reptiles, that are only intruders upon the labours of others, and that take
poſſeſſion of habitations, which they have neither art nor power to
build for themſelves. But in general, the ſame difference that
ſubſiſts between the honeycomb of the bee, and the paper-like cells of
the waſp, ſubſiſts between the different habitations of the
coral-making polypi.</p>
               <p>With regard to the various forms of theſe ſubſtances, they
have obtained different names from the nature of the animal that produced them,
or the likeneſs they bear to ſome well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known object, ſuch as coralines
fungimadre-pores, ſponges, aſtroites, and keratophytes. Tho' 
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0824000108:197"/> theſe differ extremely in their outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
yet they all are formed in the ſame manner by reptiles of various kinds and
nature. When examined chemically, they all diſcover the marks of animal
formation; the corals, as was ſaid, diſſolve in acids, the ſponges burn
with an odour ſtrongly reſembling that of burnt horn. We are left
ſomewhat at a loſs with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the preciſe manner in which this
multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of cells which at laſt aſſume the appearance of a plant or
flower, are formed. If we may be led in this ſubject by analogy, it is moſt
probable, that the ſubſtance of coral is produced in the ſame manner that
the ſhell of the ſnail grows round it; theſe little reptiles are each
poſſeſſed of a ſlimy matter, which covers its body, and this
hardening, as in the ſnail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an habitation exactly fitted to the body
of the animal that is to reſide in it; ſeveral of theſe habitations being
joined together, form at length a conſiderable maſs, and as moſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
are productive, in proportion to their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs, ſo theſe multiplying
in a ſurpriſing degree at length form thoſe extenſive foreſts that
cover the bottom of the deep.</p>
               <p>Thus all nature ſeems replete with life; almoſt every plant
on land has its ſurface co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with millions of theſe minute creatures, 
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0824000108:198"/> of whoſe exiſtence we are certain, but of whoſe
uſes we are intirely ignorant; while numbers of what ſeem plants at ſea
are not only the receptacles of inſects, but alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely of inſect
formation. This might have led ſome late philoſophers into an opinion, that
all nature was animated, that every, even the moſt inert maſs of matter,
was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with life and ſenſation, but wanted or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to make thoſe
ſenſations perceptible to the obſerver: Thoſe opinions, taken up at
random, are difficultly maintained, and as difficultly refuted; like combatants
that meet in the dark, each party may deal a thouſand blows without ever
reaching the adverſary. Thoſe perhaps are wiſer who view nature as ſhe
offers; who without ſearching too deeply into the receſſes in which ſhe
ultimately hides, are contented to take her as ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents herſelf, and
ſtoring their minds with effects, rather than with cauſes, inſtead of the
embarraſment of ſyſtems, about which few agree, are contented with the
hiſtory of appearances, concerning which, all mankind have but one
opinion.</p>

certain ſeaſons, are enemies to each other—all of the cat kind devour
nothing but fleſh, and ſtarve upon any other proviſion, iii.
198—their greateſt force lies in the claws, iii. 200—the cat goes
with young fifty-ſix days; and ſeldom brings forth above five or ſix at a
time—the male often devours the kittens—before they are a year old,
they are fit to engender, iii. 203—the female ſeeks the male with
cries; nor is their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation performed without great pain; and
why—cats hunt the ſerpents in the iſle of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus—any animal
weaker than themſelves, is to them an indiſcriminate object of
deſtruction—the mouſe is their favourite game, and they patiently
watch a whole day, until the mouſe appears, iii. 204, 205—a flagrant
mark by which the cat diſcovers its natural malignity—their eyes ſee
better in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than light; and why—if the inhabitant quits the

iii. 211—the lion cat, or more properly, the cat of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gora—the

212—all the cat kind are kept off by the fires which the inhabitants
light to preſerve their herds and flocks—and they hunt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the
ſight than the ſmell, iii. 222—it happens that the lion purſues the
jackall or the wild dog, while they are hunting upon the ſcent, and mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for themſelves; the lion is then an unwelcome intruder upon the fruits of
their toil—from thence, probably, has ariſen the ſtory of the lion's
provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, iii. 223—the lion devours a great deal at a time, and
generally fills himſelf for two or three days to come—in the deſerts

223, 224—the race of cats noxious in proportion to their power to do
miſchief—inhabit the moſt torrid latitudes of India, Africa, and
America, and have never been able to multiply beyond the torrid zone; they
ſeldom attack man, though provoked—of all animals theſe are the
moſt ſullen, and, to a proverb, untameable, iii. 259—different
claſſes of the kind from the lion to the cat, iii. 267, 268—the wild
cat and the match ſeldom meet without a combat—it is not a match for
the martin, iii. 369—the cat of Pharaoh injudiciouſly called the

diſtreſſed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of heat and cold—ſwim from the
continent into iſlands ſome leagues diſtant, iv. 256—fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
migrate from one country to another; and why—their food of the vegetable
kind, loathing all ſort of animal diet—one finding a ſpot of good
paſture, invites the reſt to partake of it—precautions by negroes and
Indians againſt them—they often break through their fence, deſtroy
the harveſt, overturn their habitations, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in order, as they
made the irruption, iv. 257—looks with attention and friendſhip at its
maſter—its ears wipe its eyes, and cover them againſt the duſt and
flies—it likes muſic, learns to beat time, move in meaſure, and join
its voice to the ſound of the drum and trumpet—is pleaſed with the
odours that delight man, iv. 258—the orange flower particularly grateful
to its taſte and ſmell—picks up flowers, and is pleaſed with the
ſcent—ſeeks the moſt odiferous plants for food; prefers the coco,
the banana, the palm, and the ſago tree to all others—eats plants to
the roots—their ſenſe of touching moſt delicate—deſcription
of its trunk—ſerving all the purpoſes of an hand—breathes,
drinks, and ſmells through the trunk, iv. 259, 260—takes a pin from the
ground, unties knots <pb facs="tcp:0824000108:303"/> of a rope, unlocks a door, and writes with
a pen, iv. 260—an object too large for the trunk to graſp, is ſucked
up by its breath, lifted and ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—the trunk its organ of
ſmelling, of touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of ſuction; of ornament and defence—its neck

wants human aſſiſtance, and chuſes to ſleep ſtanding—a
deſcription of its feet, iv. 262—and of its tuſks—theſe, with
age, become ſo heavy, that it is obliged to reſt them in holes in the walls
of its ſtall—they are two—their amazing ſize—they proceed
from the upper jaw, not from the frontal bones—and are not horns, as
ſome have ſuppoſed—nor ever ſhed in a domeſtic ſtate, ii.

261—extraordinary manner of eating—is not a rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
animal—its ſtomach and inteſtines reſemble thoſe of a
horſe—opinion that the young ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant ſucks with its trunk not with
its mouth; referred to future diſcoverers, iv. 264, 265—the ſkin not
covered with hair, a few briſtles in the ſcars and wrinkles of the body,
and thinly ſcattered over the ſkin, the hide reſembles the bark of an old
tree more than the ſkin of an animal—is ſubject to that diſorder
known by the name of elephantiaſis, or Arabian leproſy, iv. 265—in
what manner the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians endeavour to prevent it—the flies torment this
animal inceſſantly—what arts it tries to keep them off—in a
ſtate of nature, it rarely quits the river, and often ſtands in water up to
the belly, iv. 265, 266—from time immemorial employed for the purpoſes
of labour, of war, to encreaſe the grandeur of eaſtern princes, or to
extend their dominions—is a native of Africa and Aſia—ſtill
retains its natural liberty in Africa—during the ſplendour of the
Carthaginian empire, they were uſed in the <pb facs="tcp:0824000108:304"/> wars, iv.

price encreaſes in proportion to their ſize, iv. 268—the largeſt
kept for princes—their colour—that appropriated for the monarchs
own riding, kept in a palace, attended by nobles, and almoſt adored by the
people—opinions concerning the white ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant—the eaſtern
princes maintain as many ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants as they are able, and place great
confidence on their aſſiſtance in an engagement—they never breed in
a ſtate of ſervitude, and the generative powers fail when it comes under
the dominion of man, iv. 269—duration of pregnacy, in the female, ſtill
a ſecret—what Ariſtotle and others ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this and their

271, 272—negroes of Africa, who hunt this animal for its fleſh, take it
in pit-falls, iv. 273—its attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the perſon that attends
it—it comprehends ſeveral of the ſigns made to it, diſtinguiſhes
the tone of command from that of anger or approbation, and acts
accordingly—executing orders with prudence, eagerly, yet without
precipitation—is taught to kneel down, to receive its rider, uſually
mounted upon its neck—careſſes thoſe it knows, ſalutes ſuch as
ordered to diſtinguiſh, and helps to take up part of its load—takes a
pleaſure in the finery of its trappings—draws chariots, cannon, or
ſhipping with ſtrength and perſeverance; and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, provided it
be not corrected without a cauſe, and that its maſter be pleaſed with its
exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—in what manner the conductor guides it—frequently takes
ſuch an affection to its keeper as to obey no other; has been known to die of
grief for killing its conductor in a fit of madneſs—ſurpriſing
inſtance of moderation in its fury—a word ſufficient to put it into
motion, iv. 275—a century or two ago the Indian generals made great
dependence <pb facs="tcp:0824000108:305"/> upon the number and the expertneſs of their
ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants; of late they are little uſed, except for drawing cannon, and
tranſporting proviſions—ſtill they are uſed in war in Siam, in
Cochin-China, in Tonquin, and Pegu, iv. 276—in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner armed and led
to battle—effects of its fury in the field—thoſe placed upon its
back in a ſquare tower, combat as from an eminence, and fling down their
weapons with double force—no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more dreadful, or more
irreſiſtible, than ſuch moving machines, to men unacquainted with the
modern arts of war—Romans quickly learned the art of opening their ranks
to admit the elephant, iv. 277—and ſeparating it from aſſiſtance,
compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its conductors to calm the animal's fury, and to
ſubmit—ſometimes, inſtead of obeying, turned upon thoſe it was
employed to aſſiſt; one elephant is known to conſume as much as forty
men in a day—they are now chiefly employed in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or drawing
burthens throughout the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſula of India—it can, with eaſe, draw
more than ſix horſes can remove—it carries upon its back three or
four thouſand weight; and upon its tuſks it can ſupport near a
thouſand—when puſhed, it moves as ſwiftly as a horſe at full
gallop—it travels fifty or ſixty miles a day; and hard preſſed
almoſt double that quantity—heard trotting on at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
iv. 278—its tract is deeply impreſſed on the ground, and from fifteen
to eighteen inches in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter—uſed, in India, as executioners, and
with what dexterity they perform the horrid taſk—ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they
impale the criminal on their enormous tuſks, iv. 279—two ſurpriſing
inſtances how ſenſible it is of neglect, iv. 275, 279—the keeper
deſpiſing its endeavours in launching a ſhip, the animal redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled its
efforts, fractured its ſkull, and died upon the ſpot, iv. 279—revenge
one of them took upon a taylor who pricked its trunk with a needle in Deli, iv.
280—is mindful of benefits, iv. 279—inſtance of it, iv.

get leaves, chew, and thruſt them into the opening—are often killed in
