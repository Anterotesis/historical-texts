            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TOWARDS the cloſe of day Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
arrived at a ſmall village ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
among the mountains, where ſhe
purpoſed to paſs the night. The even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was remarkably fine, and the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſque
beauty of the ſurrounding ſcenery
invited her to walk. She followed the
windings of a ſtream, which was loſt at
ſome diſtance among luxuriant groves
of cheſnut. The rich colouring of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
glowed through the dark foliage,
which ſpreading a penſive gloom around,
offered a ſcene congenial to the preſent
temper of her mind, and ſhe entered the
ſhades. Her thoughts, affected by the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0793800202:4"/>
ſurrounding objects, gradually ſunk into
a pleaſing and complacent melancholy,
and ſhe was inſenſibly led on. She ſtill
followed the courſe of the ſtream to where
the deep ſhades retired, and the ſcene
again opening to day, yielded to her a
view ſo various and ſublime, that ſhe
pauſed in thrilling and delightful won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
A group of wild and groteſque
rocks roſe in a ſemicircular form, and
their fantaſtic ſhapes exhibited Nature in
her moſt ſublime and ſtriking attitudes.
Here her vaſt magnificence elevated the
mind of the beholder with high enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm.
Fancy caught the thrilling ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
and at her touch the towering
ſteeps became ſhaded with unreal
glooms; the caves more darkly frowned—the
projecting cliffs aſſumed a more
terrific aſpect, and the wild overhanging
ſhrubs waved to the gale in deeper
murmurs. The ſcene inſpired Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
with reverential awe, and her
thoughts involuntarily roſe "from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
up to Nature's God." The laſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0793800202:5"/>
gleams of day tinted the rocks and
ſhone upon the waters, which retired
through a rugged channel, and were loſt
afar among the receding cliffs. While ſhe
liſtened to their diſtant murmur, a voice
of liquid and melodious ſweetneſs aroſe
from among the rocks; it ſung an air,
whoſe melancholy expreſſion awakened
all her attention, and captivated her heart.
The tones ſwelled and died faintly away
among the clear, yet languiſhing, echoes
which the rocks repeated with an effect
like that of enchantment. Madame
looked around in ſearch of the ſweet
warbler, and obſerved at ſome diſtance
a peaſant girl ſeated on a ſmall projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the rock, overſhadowed by droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſycamores. She moved ſlowly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſpot, which ſhe had almoſt
reached, when the ſound of her ſteps
ſtartled and ſilenced the ſyren, who,
on perceiving a ſtranger, aroſe in an
attitude to depart. The voice of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
arreſted her, and ſhe approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0793800202:6"/>
Language cannot paint the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Madame, when, in the diſguiſe
of a peaſant girl, ſhe diſtinguiſhed the
features of Julia, whoſe eyes lighted up
with ſudden recollection, and who ſunk
into her arms overcome with joy. When
their firſt emotions were ſubſided,
and Julia had received anſwers to her enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
concerning Ferdinand and Emilia,
ſhe led Madame to the place of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment.
This was a ſolitary cottage,
in a cloſe valley ſurrounded by moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
whoſe cliffs appeared wholly inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible
to mortal foot. The deep ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the ſcene diſſipated at once Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame's
wonder that Julia had ſo long
remained undiſcovered, and excited ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
how ſhe had been able to explore
a ſpot thus deeply ſequeſtered; but
Madame obſerved with extreme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
that the countenance of Julia no
longer wore the ſmile of health and
gaiety. Her fine features had received
the impreſſions not only of melancholy,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0793800202:7"/>
but of grief. Madame ſighed as ſhe
gazed, and read too plainly the cauſe
of the change. Julia underſtood that ſigh,
and anſwered it with her tears. She
preſſed the hand of Madame in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſilence to her lips, and her cheeks
were ſuffuſed with a crimſon glow. At
length, recovering herſelf, "I have
much, my dear Madame, to tell," ſaid
ſhe, "and much to explain, 'ere you
will admit me again to that eſteem of
which I was once ſo juſtly proud. I
had no reſource from miſery, but
in flight; and of that I could not make
you a confidant, without meanly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving
you in its diſgrace." "Say no
more, my love, on the ſubject," replied
Madame; "with reſpect to myſelf, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
your conduct, and felt ſeverely
for your ſituation. Rather let me hear
by what means you effected your eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
and what has ſince befallen you."
Julia pauſed a moment, as if to ſtiſle her
riſing emotion, and then commenced her narrative.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0793800202:8"/>
"You are already acquainted with
the ſecret of that night, ſo fatal to my
peace. I recall the remembrance of it
with an anguiſh which I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal;
and why ſhould I wiſh its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment,
ſince I mourn for one, whoſe noble
qualities juſtified all my admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and deſerved more than my
feeble praiſe can beſtow; the idea of
whom will be the laſt to linger in
my mind till death ſhuts up this pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſcene." Her voice trembled, and
ſhe pauſed. After a few moments ſhe
reſumed her tale. "I will ſpare my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the pain of recurring to ſcenes
with which you are not unacquainted,
and proceed to thoſe which more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
attract your intereſt. Caterina,
my faithful ſervant, you know, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me in my confinement; to her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
I owe my eſcape. She obtained
from her lover, a ſervant in the caſtle,
that aſſiſtance which gave me liberty.
One night when Carlo, who had been
appointed my guard, was aſleep, Nicolo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0793800202:9"/>
crept into his chamber, and ſtole from
him the keys of my priſon. He had
previouſly procured a ladder of ropes.
O! I can never forget my emotions,
when in the dead hour of that night,
which was meant to precede the day of
my ſacrifice, I heard the door of my
priſon unlock, and found myſelf half
at liberty! My trembling limbs with
difficulty ſupported me as I followed
Caterina to the ſaloon, the windows of
which being low and near to the terrace,
ſuited our purpoſe. To the terrace we
eaſily got, where Nicolo awaited us with
the rope ladder. He faſtened it to the
ground; and having climbed to the top
of the parapet, quickly ſlided down
on the other ſide. There he held it
while we aſcended, and deſcended; and
I ſoon breathed the air of freedom again.
But the apprehenſion of being retaken
was ſtill too powerful to permit a full
enjoyment of my eſcape. It was my
plan to proceed to the place of my
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0793800202:10"/>
faithful Caterina's nativity, where ſhe
had aſſured me I might find a ſafe aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
in the cottage of her parents, from
whom, as they had never ſeen me I
might conceal my birth. This place,
ſhe ſaid, was entirely unknown to the
marquis, who had hired her at Naples
only a few months before, without any
enquiries concerning her family. She
had informed me that the village was
many leagues diſtant from the caſtle,
but that ſhe was very well acquainted
with the road. At the foot of the walls
we left Nicolo, who returned to the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to prevent ſuſpicion, but with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to leave it at a leſs dangerous
time, and repair to Farrini to his good
Caterina. I parted from him with many
thanks, and gave him a ſmall diamond
croſs, which, for that purpoſe, I had
taken from the jewels ſent to me for
wedding ornaments."</p>

            <p>"ABOUT aquarter of a league from
the walls we ſtopped, and I aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the habit in which you now ſee me.
My own dreſs was faſtened to ſome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
ſtones, and Caterina threw it into the
ſtream, whoſe murmurings you have ſo
often admired. The fatigue and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
I endured in this journey, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
almoſt wholly on foot, at any other
time would have overcome me; but my
mind was ſo occupied by the danger I
was avoiding, that theſe leſſer evils were
diſregarded. We arrived in ſafety at
the cottage, which ſtood at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from the village of Farrini and
were received by Caterina's parents with
ſome ſurprize, and more kindneſs. I
ſoon perceived it would be uſeleſs, and
even dangerous, to attempt to preſeve
the character I perſonated. In the eyes
of Caterina's mother, I read a degree of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0793800202:12"/>
ſurprize and admiration which declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhe believed me of ſuperior rank;
I, therefore, thought it more prudent to
win her fidelity by entruſting her with
my ſecret than, by endeavouring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it, leave it to be diſcovered by
her curioſity or diſcernment. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
I made known my quality and
my diſtreſs, and received ſtrong aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of aſſiſtance and attachment. For fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſecurity, I removed to this ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſpot. The cottage we are now in
belongs to a ſiſter of Caterina, upon whoſe
faithfulneſs I have been hitherto fully
juſtified in relying. But I am not even
here ſecure from apprehenſion, ſince for
ſeveral days paſt horſemen of a ſupici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
appearance have been obſerved near
Marcy, which is only half a league from hence."</p>
            <p>Here Julia cloſed her narration,to
which Madame had liſtened with a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſurprize and pity, which her eyes
ſufficiently diſcovered. The laſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0793800202:13"/>
of the narrative ſeriouſly alarmed
her. She acquainted Julia with the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
which the duke had undertaken;
and ſhe did not heſitate to believe it a
party of his people whom Julia had deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed.
Madame, therefore, carneſtly
adviſed her to quit her preſent ſituation,
and to accompany her in diſguiſe to the
monaſtery of St. Auguſtin, where ſhe
would find a ſecure retreat; becauſe,
even if her place of refuge ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
the ſuperior authority of the
church would protect her. Julia ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
the propoſal with much joy. As
it was neceſſary that Madame ſhould
ſleep at the village where ſhe had left
her ſervants and horſes, it was agreed
that at break of day ſhe ſhould return to
the cottage, where Julia would await
her. Madame took an affectionate leave
of Julia, whoſe heart, in ſpite of reaſon,
ſunk when ſhe ſaw her depart though
but for the neceſſary interval of repoſe.</p>
            <p>At the dawn of day Madame aroſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0793800202:14"/>
Her ſervants, who were hired for the
journey, were ſtrangers to Julia, from
them, therefore, ſhe had nothing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.
She reached the cottage before
ſun-riſe, having left her people at ſome
little diſtance. Her heart foreboded evil,
when, on knocking at the door, no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was returned. She knocked again,
and ſtill all was ſilent. Through the
caſement ſhe could diſcover no object,
amidſt the grey obſcurity of the dawn.
She now opened the door, and to her
inexpreſſible aſtoniſhment and diſtreſs,
found the cottage empty. She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to a ſmall inner room, where lay
a part of Julia's apparel. The bed had no
appearance of having been ſlept in, and
every moment ſerved to heighten and
confirm her apprehenſions. While ſhe
purſued the ſearch, ſhe ſuddenly heard
the trampling of feet at the cottage door,
and preſently after ſome people entered.
Her fears for Julia now yielded to thoſe
for her own ſafety, and ſhe was undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0793800202:15"/>
whether to diſcover herſelf, or
remain in her preſent ſituation, when
ſhe was relieved from her irreſolution
and diſtreſs by the appearance of Julia.</p>
            <p>On the return of the good woman,
who had accompanied Madame to the
village on the preceding night, Julia went
to the cottage at Farrini. Her grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
heart would not ſuffer her to depart
without taking leave of her faithful
friends, thanking them for their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and informing them of her future
proſpects. They had prevailed upon
her to ſpend the few intervening hours
at this cot, whence ſhe had juſt riſen
to meet Madame.</p>
            <p>They now haſtened to the ſpot where
the horſes were ſtationed,and commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their journey. For ſome leagues they
travelled in ſilence and thought, over
a wild and pictureſque country. The
landſcape was tinted with rich and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
hues; and the autumnal lights,
which ſtreamed upon the hills, produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0793800202:16"/>
a ſpirited and beautiful effect upon the
ſcenery. All the glories of the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
roſe to their view: the purple
grapes fluſhed through the dark green of
the ſurrounding foliage, and the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
glowed with warm luxuriance.</p>
            <p>They now deſcended into a deep val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
which appeared more like a ſcene
of airy enchantment than reality. Along
the bottom flowed a clear majeſtic
ſtream, whoſe banks were adorned with
thick groves of orange and citron trees.
Julia ſurveyed the ſcene in ſilent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency,
but her eye quickly caught
an object which changed with inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
ſhock the tone of her feelings.
She obſerved a party of horſemen wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the ſide of a hill behind them.
Their uncommon ſpeed alarmed her,
and she pushed her horſe into a gallop.
On looking back they clearly perceived
themſelves to be purſued. Soon after
the men ſuddenly appeared from behind
a dark grove within a ſmall diſtance of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0793800202:17"/>
them; and upon their nearer approach,
Julia overcome with fatigue and fear,
ſunk breathleſs from her horſe. She was
ſaved from the ground by one of the
purſuers, who caught her in his arms.
Madame, with the reſt of the party, were
quickly overtaken; and as ſoon as Julia
revived, they were bound, and re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to the hill from whence they had
deſcended. Imagination only can paint
the anguiſh of Julia's mind, when ſhe ſaw
herſelf thus delivered up to the power of
her enemy. Madame, in the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
troop, diſcovered none of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's
people, and they were therefore
evidently in the hands of the duke.
After travelling for ſome hours, they
quitted the main road, and turned into
a narrow winding dell, overſhadowed
by high trees, which almoſt excluded
the light. The gloom of the place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
terrific images. Julia trembled
as ſhe entered; and her emotion was
heightened, when ſhe perceived at ſome
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0793800202:18"/>
diſtance, through the long perſpective
of the trees, a large ruinous manſion.
The gloom of the ſurrounding ſhades
partly concealed it from her view; but,
as ſhe drew near, each forlorn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying
feature of the fabric was gradually
diſcloſed, and ſtruck upon her heart a
horror ſuch as ſhe had never before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced.
The broken battlements,
enwreathed with ivy, proclaimed the
fallen grandeur of the place, while the
ſhattered vacant window frames exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
its deſolation, and the high graſs that
overgrew the threſhold, ſeemed to ſay
how long it was ſince mortal foot had
entered. The place appeared fit only for
the purpoſes of violence and deſtruction:
and the unfortunate captives, when they
ſtopped at its gates, felt the full force
of its horrors.</p>
            <p>They were taken from their horſes,
and conveyed to an interior part of the
building, which, if it had once been a
chamber, no longer deſerved the name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0793800202:19"/>
Here the guard ſaid they were directed
to detain them till the arrival of their
lord, who had appointed this the place of
rendezvous. He was expected to meet
them in a few hours, and theſe were
hours of indeſcribable torture to Julia
and Madame. From the furious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the duke, exaſperated by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
diſappointment, Julia had every
evil to apprehend; and the lonelineſs of
the ſpot he had choſen, enabled him to
perpetrate any deſigns, however violent.
For the firſt time, ſhe repented that ſhe
had left her father's houſe. Madame
wept over her, but comfort ſhe had none
to give. The day cloſed—the duke did
not appear, and the fate of Julia yet
hung in perilous uncertainty. At length,
from a window of the apartment ſhe
was in, ſhe diſtinguiſhed a glimmering
of torches among the trees, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after the clattering of hoofs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
her the duke was approaching.
Her heart ſunk at the ſound; and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0793800202:20"/>
her arms round Madame's neck, ſhe
reſigned herſelf to deſpair. She was
ſoon rouſed by ſome men, who came to
announce the arrival of their lord. In
a few moments the place, which had
lately been ſo ſilent, echoed with tumult;
and a ſudden blaze of light illum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining
the fabric, ſerved to exhibit more
forcibly its ſtriking horrors. Julia ran to
the window; and in a ſort of court below,
perceived a group of men diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from their horſes. The torches
ſhed a partial light; and while ſhe
anxiouſly looked around for the perſon
of the duke, the whole party entered the
manſion. She liſtened to a confuſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar
of voices, which ſounded from the
room beneath, and ſoon after it ſunk
into a low murmur, as if ſome matter of
importance was in agitation. For ſome
moments ſhe ſat in lingering terror,
when ſhe heard footſteps advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the chamber, and a ſudden gleam
of torch-light flaſhed upon the walls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0793800202:21"/>
"Wretched girl! I have at laſt ſecured
you!" ſaid a cavalier, who now entered
the room. He ſtopped as he perceived
Julia; and turning to the men who
ſtood without, "Are theſe," ſaid he,
"the fugitives you have taken?" "Yes,
my lord."—"Then you have deceived
yourſelves, and miſled me; this is not
my daughter." Theſe words ſtruck the
ſudden light of truth and joy upon the
heart of Julia, whom terror had before
rendered almoſt lifeleſs; and who had
not perceived that the perſon entering
was a ſtranger. Madame now ſtepped for ward,
and an explanation enſued, when
it appeared that the ſtranger was the
marquis Murani, the father of the fair
fugitive whom the duke had before
miſtaken for Julia.</p>
            <p>The appearance and the evident flight
of Julia, had deceived the banditti em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by this nobleman, into a belief
that ſhe was the object of their ſearch,
and had occaſioned her this unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0793800202:22"/>
diſtreſs. But the joy ſhe now felt
on finding herſelf thus unexpectedly at
liberty, ſurpaſſed, if poſſible, her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
terrors. The marquis made Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
and Julia all the reparation in
his power, by offering immediately to
reconduct them to the main road, and
to guard them to ſome place of ſafety
for the night. This offer was eagerly
and thankfully accepted; and though
faint from diſtreſs, fatigue, and want of
ſuſtenance, they joyfully remounted
their horſes, and by torch-light quitted
the manſion. After ſome hours travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
they arrived at a ſmall town, where
they procured the accommodation ſo
neceſſary to their ſupport and repoſe.
Here their guides quitted them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
their ſearch.</p>
            <p>They aroſe with the dawn, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
their journey, continually terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the apprehenſion of encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the duke's people. At noon they
arrived at Azulia, from whence the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0793800202:23"/>
monaſtery; or abbey of St. Auguſtin
was diſtant only a few miles. Madame
wrote to the <hi>Padre Abate,</hi> to whom ſhe
was ſomewhat related, and ſoon after
received an anſwer very favourable to
her wiſhes. The ſame evening they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to the abbey, where Julia, once
more relieved from the fear of purſuit,
offered up a prayer of gratitude to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and endeavoured, to calm her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
by devotion. She was received by
the abbot with a ſort of paternal affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by the nuns with officious
kindneſs. Comforted by theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and by the tranquil appearance
of every thing around her, ſhe retired to
reſt, and paſſed the night in peaceful
ſlumbers</p>
            <p>In her preſent ſituation ſhe found
much novelty to amuſe, and much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
matter to engage her mind. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendered
by diſtreſs, ſhe eaſily yielded to
the penſive manners of her companions,
and to the ſerene uniformity of a monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0793800202:24"/>
life. She loved to wander through
the lonely cloiſters, and high-arched
aiſles, whoſe long perſpectives retired
in ſimple grandeur, diffuſing a holy
calm around. She found much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in the converſation of the nuns,
many of whom were uncommonly ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and the dignified ſweetneſs of
whoſe manners formed a charm irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibly
attractive. The ſoft melancholy
impreſſed upon their countenances, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
the ſituation of their minds, and
excited in Julia a very intereſting mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of pity and eſteem. The affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
appellation of ſiſter, and all that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing
tenderneſs which they ſo well
know how to diſplay, and of which they
ſo well underſtand the effect, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on Julia, in the hope of winning
her to become one of their order.</p>
            <p>Soothed by the preſence of Madame,
the aſſiduity of the nuns, and by the
ſtillneſs and ſanctity of the place, her
mind gradually recovered a degree of
complacency to which it had long been
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0793800202:25"/>
a ſtranger. But notwithſtanding all her
efforts, the idea of Hippolitus would at
intervals return upon her memory with a
force that at once ſubdued her fortitude,
and ſunk her in a temporary deſpair.</p>
            <p>Among the holy ſiſters, Julia diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
one, the ſingular fervor of whoſe
devotion, and the penſive air of whoſe
countenance, ſoftened by the languor of
illneſs, attracted her curioſity, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
a ſtrong degree of pity. The nun,
by a ſort of ſympathy, ſeemed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
inclined towards Julia, which ſhe
diſcovered by innumerable acts of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſuch as the heart can quickly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
and acknowledge, although
deſcription can never reach them. In
converſation with her, Julia endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as far as delicacy would permit,
to prompt an explanation of that more
than common dejection which ſhaded
thoſe features, where beauty, touched
by refignation and ſublimed by religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſhone forth with mild and lambent luſtre.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0793800202:26"/>
The duke de Luovo, after having
been detained for ſome weeks by the
fever which his wounds had produced,
and his irritated paſſions had much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed,
arrived at the caſtle of Mazzini.
When the marquis ſaw him return, and
recollected the futility of thoſe exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by which he had boaſtingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to recover Julia, the violence of
his nature ſpurned the diſguiſe of art,
and burſt forth in contemptuous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
of the valour and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the duke, who ſoon retorted
with equal fury. The conſequence
might have been fatal, had not the
ambition of the marquis ſubdued the
ſudden irritation of his inferior paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and induced him to ſoften the ſeverity
of his accuſations, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
conceſſions. The duke, whoſe
paſſion for Julia was heightened by the
difficulty which oppoſed it, admitted
ſuch conceſſions as in other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
he would have rejected; and
thus each, conquered by the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0793800202:27"/>
paſſion of the moment, ſubmitted
to be the ſlave of his adverſary.</p>
            <p>Emilia was at length releaſed from
the confinement ſhe had ſo unjuſtly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
She had now the uſe of her old
apartments, where, ſolitary and dejected,
her hours moved heavily along, embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by inceſſant anxiety for Julia,
and by regret for the loſt ſociety of
Madame. The marchioneſs, whoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
ſuffered a temporary ſuſpenſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the preſent confuſion at the caſtle,
exerciſed the ill-humoured caprice,
which diſappointment and laſſitude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired,
upon her remaining ſubject.
Emilia was condemned to ſuffer, and
to endure without the privilege of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining.
In reviewing the events of the
laſt few weeks, ſhe ſaw thoſe moſt
dear to her baniſhed, or impriſoned by
the ſecret influence of a woman, every
feature of whoſe character was exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppoſite to that of the amiable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe had been appointed to ſucceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0793800202:28"/>
The ſearch after Julia ſtill continued,
and was ſtill unſucceſsful. The aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of the marquis increaſed with
his diſappointments; for where could
Julia, ignorant of the country, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute
of friends, have poſſibly found
an aſylum? He ſwore with a terrible oath
to revenge on her head, whenever ſhe
ſhould be found, the trouble and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhe now cauſed him. But he agreed
with the duke to relinquiſh for a while
the ſearch; till Julia, gaining confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from the obſervation of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
might gradually ſuppoſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſecure from moleſtation, and thus
be induced to emerge by degrees from concealment.</p>

            <p>MEAN WHILE Julia, ſheltered in
the obſcure receſſes of St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,
endeavoured to attain a degree of
that tranquillity which ſo ſtrikingly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized
the ſcenes around her. The
abbey of St. Auguſtin was a large mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
maſs of Gothic architecture,
whoſe gloomy battlements, and majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
towers, aroſe in proud ſublimity
from amid the darkneſs of the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhades. It was founded in the
twelfth century, and ſtood a proud
monument of monkiſh ſuperſtition and
princely munificence. In the times
when Italy was agitated by internal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
and perſecuted by foreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders,
this edifice afforded an aſylum
to many noble Italian emigrants, who
here conſecrated the reſt of their days
to religion. At their death they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
the monaſtery with the treaſures
which it had enabled them to ſecure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0793800202:30"/>
The view of this building revived in
the mind of the beholder the memory
of paſt ages. The manners and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which diſtinguiſhed them aroſe to
his fancy, and through the long lapſe of
years, he diſcriminated thoſe cuſtoms
and manners which formed ſo ſtriking
a contraſt to the modes of his own times.
The rude manners, the boiſterous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
the daring ambition, and the groſs
indulgences which formerly characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
the prieſt, the nobleman, and the
ſovereign, had then begun to yield to
learning—the charms of refined conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation—political
intrigue and private ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices.
Thus do the ſcenes of life vary
with the predominant paſſions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and with the progreſs of civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The dark clouds of prejudice
break away before the ſun of ſcience,
and gradually diſſolving, leave the
brightening hemiſphere to the influence
of his beams. But through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſcene appeared only a few ſcattered
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0793800202:31"/>
rays, which ſerved to ſhew more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the vaſt and heavy maſſes that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
the form of truth. Here preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
not reaſon, ſuſpended the influence
of the paſſions; and ſcholaſtic learning,
myſterious philoſophy, and crafty ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
ſupplied the place of wiſdom, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
and pure devotion.</p>
            <p>At the abbey, ſolitude and ſtillneſs,
conſpired with the ſolemn aſpect of the
pile to impreſs the mind with religious
awe. The dim glaſs of the high-arched
windows, ſtained with the colouring of
monkiſh fictions, and ſhaded by the
thick trees that environed the abbey,
ſpread around a ſacred gloom, which
inſpired the beholder with congenial feelings.</p>
            <p>As Julia muſed through the walks,
and ſurveyed this vaſt monument of
barbarous ſuperſtition, it brought to her
recollection an ode which ſhe often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
with melancholy pleaſure, as the
compoſition of Hippolitus.</p>

            <p>She wept to the memory of times
paſt, and there was a romantic ſadneſs
in her feelings, luxurious and indefina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Madame behaved to Julia with
the tendereſt attention, and endeavoured
to withdraw her thoughts from their
mournful ſubject, by promoting that
taſte for literature and muſic, which was
ſo ſuitable to the powers of her mind.</p>
            <p>But an object ſeriouſly intereſting
now obtained that regard, which thoſe
of mere amuſement failed to attract.
Her favourite nun, for whom her love
and eſteem daily encreaſed, ſeemed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
under the preſſure of a ſecret
grief. Julia was deeply affected with
her ſituation, and though ſhe was not
empowered to adminiſter conſolation to
her ſorrows, ſhe endeavoured to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the ſufferings of illneſs. She nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0793800202:34"/>
her with unremitting care, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſeize with avidity the temporary
opportunity of eſcaping from herſelf.
The nun appeared perfectly reconciled
to her fate, and exhibited during her ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo much ſweetneſs, patience, and
reſignation, as affected all around her
with pity and love. Her angelic mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſteady fortitude, characterized
the beatification of a ſaint, rather than
the death of a mortal. Julia watched
every turn of her diſorder with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſolicitude, and her care was at
length rewarded by the amendment of
Cornelia. Her health gradually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
and ſhe attributed this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
to the aſſiduity and tenderneſs
of her young friend, to whom her heart
now expanded in warm and unreſerved
affection. At length Julia ventured to
ſolicit what ſhe had ſo long and ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
wiſhed for, and Cornelia unfolded
the hiſtory of her ſorrows.</p>
            <p>"Of the life which your care has
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0793800202:35"/>
prolonged," ſaid ſhe, "it is but juſt
that you ſhould know the events;
though thoſe events are neither new,
or ſtriking, and poſſeſs little power
of intereſting perſons unconnected with
them. To me they have, however,
been unexpectedly dreadful in effect,
and my heart aſſures me, that to you
they will not be indifferent."</p>
            <p>"I am the unfortunate deſcendant of
an ancient and illuſtrious Italian family.
In early childhood I was deprived of a
mother's care, but the tenderneſs of my
ſurviving parent made her loſs, as to my
welfare, almoſt unfelt. Suffer me here
to do juſtice to the character of my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
father. He united in an eminent
degree, the mild virtues of ſocial life,
with the firm unbending qualities of the
noble Romans, his anceſters, from whom
he was proud to trace his deſcent. Their
merit, indeed, continually dwelt on his
tongue, and their actions he was always
endeavouring to imitate, as far as was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0793800202:36"/>
conſiſtent with the character of his times,
and with the limited ſphere in which he
moved. The recollection of his virtue
elevates my mind, and fills my heart
with a noble pride, which even the cold
walls of a monaſtery have not been able
to ſubdue.</p>
            <p>My father's fortune was unſuitable to
his rank. That his ſon might hereafter
be enabled to ſupport the dignity of his
family, it was neceſſary for me to aſſume
the veil. Alas! that heart was unfit to
be offered at an heavenly ſhrine, which
was already devoted to an earthly object.
My affections had long been engaged
by the the younger ſon of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nobleman, whoſe character and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments
attracted my early love,
and confirmed my lateſt eſteem. Our
families were intimate, and our youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
intercourſe occaſioned an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which ſtrengthened and expanded
with our years. He ſolicited me of my
father, but there appeared an inſuperable
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0793800202:37"/>
barrier to our union. The family of
my lover laboured under circumſtances
of ſimilar diſtreſs with that of my own—it
was noble—but poor! My father,
who was ignorant of the ſtrength of my
affection, and who conſidered a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
formed in poverty as deſtructive
to happineſs, prohibited his ſuit.</p>
            <p>Touched with chagrin and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
he immediately entered into
the ſervice of his Neapolitian majeſty,
and ſought in the tumultuous ſcenes of
glory, a refuge from the pangs of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
paſſion.</p>
            <p>To me, whoſe hours moved in one
round of dull uniformity—who had no
purſuit to intereſt—no variety to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
my drooping ſpirits—to me the
effort of forgetfulneſs was ineffectual.
The loved idea of Angelo ſtill roſe
upon my fancy, and its powers of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation,
heightened by abſence, and,
perhaps, even by deſpair, purſued me
with inceſſant grief. I concealed in

ſilence the anguiſh that preyed upon
my heart, and reſigned myſelf a willing
victim to monaſtic auſterity. But I was
now threatened with a new evil, terrible
and unexpected. I was ſo unfortunate
as to attract the admiration of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
Marinelli, and he applied to my
father. He was illuſtrious at once in
birth and fortune, and his viſits could
only be unwelcome to me. Dreadful
was the moment in which my father
diſcloſed to me the propoſal. My diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
which I vainly endeavoured to
command, diſcovered the exact ſituation
of my heart, and my father was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>After a long and awful pauſe, he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly
releaſed me from my diſtreſs,
by leaving it to my choice to accept the
marquis, or to aſſume the veil. I fell
at his feet, overcome by the noble diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſtedneſs
of his conduct, and inſtantly accepted the latter.</p>
            <p>This affair removed entirely the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0793800202:41"/>
with which I had hitherto guarded
my heart;—my brother—my generous
brother! learned the true ſtate of its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
He ſaw the grief which prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon my health; he obſerved it to
my father, and he nobly—oh how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly!
to reſtore my happineſs, deſired to
reſign a part of the eſtate which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
deſcended to him in right of his
mother. "Alas! Hippolitus," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Cornelia, deeply ſighing, "thy
virtues deſerved a better fate."</p>
            <p>"Hippolitus!" ſaid Julia, in a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous
accent, "Hippolitus, count de
Vereza!" "The ſame," replied the
nun, in a tone of ſurprize. Julia was
ſpeechleſs; tears, however, came to her
relief. The aſtoniſhment of Cornelia
for ſome moment ſurpaſſed expreſſion;
at length a gleam of recollection croſſed
her mind, and ſhe too well underſtood
the ſcene before her. Julia, after ſome
time revived, when Cornelia tenderly
approaching her, "Do I then embrace
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0793800202:42"/>
my ſiſter!" ſaid ſhe, "United in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are we alſo united in misfortune?"

At length Cornelia reſumed her narrative.</p>
            <p>"My father, ſtruck with the conduct
of Hippolitus, pauſed upon the offer.
The alteration in my health was too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to eſcape his notice; the conflict
between pride and parental tenderneſs,
held him for ſome time in indeciſion,
but the latter finally ſubdued every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
feeling, and he yielded his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to my marriage with Angelo. The
ſudden tranſition from grief to joy, was
almoſt too much for my feeble frame;
judge then what muſt have been the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the dreadful reverſe, when the
news arrived that Angelo had fallen in
a foreign engagement! Let me oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
if poſſible, the impreſſion of ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſo dreadful. The ſufferings of
my brother, whoſe generous heart could
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0793800202:43"/>
ſo finely feel for another's woe, were on
this occaſion inferior only to my own.</p>
            <p>After the firſt exceſs of my grief was
ſubſided, I deſired to retire from a world
which had tempted me only with illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
viſions of happineſs, and to remove
from thoſe ſcenes which prompted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection,
and perpetuated my diſtreſs.
My father applauded my reſolution, and
I immediately was admitted a noviciate
into this monaſtery, with the Superior of
which my father had in his youth been acquainted.</p>
            <p>At the expiration of the year I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the veil. Oh! I well remember
with what perfect reſignation, with what
comfortable complacency I took thoſe
vows which bound me to a life of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and religious reſt.</p>
            <p>The high importance of the moment,
the ſolemnity of the ceremony, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
glooms which ſurrounded me, and
the chilling ſilence that prevailed when
I uttered the irrevocable vow—all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0793800202:44"/>
to impreſs my imagination, and
to raiſe my views to heaven. When I
knelt at the altar, the ſacred flame of
pure devotion glowed in my heart, and
elevated my ſoul to ſublimity. The
world and all its recollections faded
from my mind, and left it to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of a ſerene and holy enthuſiaſm
which no words can deſcribe.</p>
            <p>Soon after my noviciation, I had the
misfortune to loſe my dear father. In
the tranquillity of this monaſtery, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
in the ſoothing kindneſs of my
companions, and in devotional exerciſes,
my ſorrows found relief, and the ſting
of grief was blunted. My repoſe was of
ſhort continuance. A circumſtance oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
that renewed the miſery, which
can now never quit me but in the grave,
to which I look with no fearful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
but as a refuge from calamity,
truſting that the power who has ſeen
good to afflict me, will pardon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectneſs
of my devotion, and the too
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0793800202:45"/>
frequent wandering of my thoughts to
the objects once ſo dear to me."</p>
            <p>As ſhe ſpoke ſhe raiſed her eyes,
which beamed with truth and meek aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,
to heaven; and the fine devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
ſuffuſion of her countenance ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to characterize the beauty of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired ſaint.</p>
            <p>"One day, Oh! never ſhall I forget
it, I went as uſual to the confeſſional
to acknowledge my ſins. I knelt before
the father with eyes bent towards the
earth, and in a low voice proceeded to
confeſs. I had but one crime to deplore,
and that was the too tender remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of him for whom I mourned,
and whoſe idea impreſſed upon my
heart, made it a blemiſhed offering to
God.</p>
            <p>I was interrupted in my confeſſion
by a ſound of deep ſobs, and raiſing my
eyes, Oh God, what were my ſenſations,
when in the features of the holy father,
I diſcovered Angelo! His image fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0793800202:46"/>
like a viſion from my fight, and I
funk at his feet. On recovering I found
myſelf on my matraſs attended by a
ſiſter, who I diſcovered by her conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
had no ſuſpicion of the occaſion
of my diſorder. Indiſpoſition confined
me to my bed for ſeveral days; when I
recovered, I ſaw Angelo no more, and
could almoſt have doubted my ſenſes,
and believed that an illuſion had croſſed
my ſight, till one day I found in my cell
a written paper. I diſtinguiſhed at the
firſt glance the hand writing of Angelo,
that well known hand which had ſo
often awakened me to other emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
I trembled at the ſight; my beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heart acknowledged the beloved
characters; a cold tremor ſhook my
frame, and half breathleſs I ſeized the
paper. But recollecting myſelf, I pauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—I
heſitated: duty at length yielded
to the ſtrong temptation, and I read the
lines. Oh! thoſe lines! prompted by
deſpair, and bathed in my tears! every
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0793800202:47"/>
word they offered gave a new pang to
my heart, and ſwelled its anguiſh almoſt
beyond endurance. I learned that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,
ſeverely wounded in a foreign en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
had been left for dead
upon the field; that his life
was ſaved by the humanity of a common ſoldier
of the enemy, who perceiving ſigns
of exiſtence, conveyed him to a
houſe. Aſſiſtance was ſoon procured,
but his wounds exhibited the moſt
alarming ſymptoms. During ſeveral
months he languiſhed between life and
death, till at length his youth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
ſurmounted the conflict, and
he returned to Naples. Here he ſaw
my brother, whoſe diſtreſs and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
at beholding him occaſioned
a relation of paſt circumſtances, and of
the vows I had taken in conſequence of
the report of his death. It is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſry
to mention the immediate effect
of this narration; the final one exhibited
a very ſingular proof his attachment
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0793800202:48"/>
and deſpair;—he devoted himſelf to a
monaſtic life, and choſe this abbey for
the place of his reſidence, becauſe it
contained the object moſt dear to his
affections. His letter informed me that
he had purpoſely avoided diſcovering
himſelf, endeavouring to be contented
with the opportunities which occurred of
ſilently obſerving me, till chance had
occaſioned the foregoing interview.—But
that ſince its effects had been ſo
mutually painful, he would relieve me
from the apprehenſion of a ſimilar diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
by aſſuring me, that I ſhould ſee
him no more. He was faithful to his
promiſe; from that day I have never
ſeen him, and am even ignorant whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he yet inhabits this aſylum; the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of religious fortitude, and the juſt
fear of exciting ſurprize, having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
me from enquiry. But the moment
of our laſt interview has been equally
fatal to my peace and to my health, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0793800202:49"/>
I truſt I ſhall ere very long be releaſed
from the agonizing ineffectual ſtruggles
occaſioned by the conſciouſneſs of ſacred
vows imperfectly performed, and by
earthly affections not wholly ſubdued."</p>
            <p>Cornelia ceaſed, and Julia, who had
liſtened to the narrative in deep atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
at once admired, loved, and pitied
her. As the ſiſter of Hippolitus, her
heart expanded towards her, and it was
now inviolably attached by the fine ties
of ſympathetic ſorrow. Similarity of
ſentiment and ſuffering united them in
the firmeſt bonds of friendſhip; and thus,
from reciprocation of thought and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
flowed a pure and ſweet conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Julia loved to indulge in the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
pleaſure of converſing of Hippolitus,
and when thus engaged, the hours crept
unheeded by. A thouſand queſtions
ſhe repeated concerning him, but to
thoſe moſt intereſting to her, ſhe receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0793800202:50"/>
no conſolatory anſwer. Cornelia, who
had heard of the fatal tranſaction at the
caſtle of Mazzini, deplored with her its
too certain conſequence.</p>

            <p>JULIA accuſtomed herſelf to walk in
the fine evenings under the ſhade of
the high trees that environed the abbey.
The dewy coolneſs of the air refreſhed
her. The innumerable roſeate tints
which the parting ſun-beams reflected
on the rocks above, and the fine vermil
glow diffuſed over the romantic ſcene
beneath, ſoftly fading from the eye, as
the night-ſhades fell, excited ſenſations
of a ſweet and tranquil nature, and
ſoothed her into a temporary forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her ſorrows.</p>
            <p>The deep ſolitude of the place ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
her apprehenſion, and one evening
ſhe ventured with Madame de Menon
to lengthen her walk. They returned
to the abbey without having ſeen a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
being, except a friar of the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
who had been to a neighbouring
town to order proviſion. On the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0793800202:52"/>
evening they repeated their
walk; and engaged in converſation,
rambled to a conſiderable diſtance from
the abbey. The diſtant bell of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
ſounding for veſpers, reminded
them of the hour, and looking round,
they perceived the extremity of the
wood. They were returning towards
the abbey, when ſtruck by the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of ſome majeſtic columns which
were diſtinguiſhable between the trees,
they pauſed. Curioſity tempted them
to examine to what edifice pillars of
ſuch magnificent architecture could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
in a ſcene ſo rude, and they went
on.</p>
            <p>There appeared on a point of rock
impending over the valley, the reliques
of a palace, whoſe beauty time had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
only to heighten its ſublimity.
An arch of ſingular magnificence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
almoſt entire, beyond which
appeared wild cliffs retiring in grand
perſpective. The fun, which was now
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0793800202:53"/>
ſetting, threw a trembling luſtre upon
the ruins, and gave a finiſhing effect to
the ſcene. They gazed in mute wonder
upon the view; but the faſt fading light,
and the dewy chillneſs of the air warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to return. As Julia gave a laſt
look to the ſcene, ſhe perceived two
men leaning upon a part of the ruin at
ſome diſtance, in earneſt converſation.
As they ſpoke, their looks were ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively
bent on her, that ſhe could
have no doubt ſhe was the ſubject of their
diſcourſe. Alarmed at this circumſtance,
Madame and Julia immediately retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards the abbey. They walked
ſwiftly through the woods, whoſe ſhades,
deepened by the gloom of evening,
prevented their diſtinguiſhing whether
they were purſued. They were ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to obſerve the diſtance to which they
had ſtrayed from the monaſtery, whoſe
dark towers were now obſcurely ſeen
riſing among the trees that cloſed the
perſpective. They had almoſt reached
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0793800202:54"/>
the gates, when on looking back, they
perceived the ſame men ſlowly advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without any appearance of purſuit,
but clearly as if obſerving the place of
their retreat.</p>
            <p>This incident occaſioned Julia much
alarm. She could not but believe that
the men whom ſhe had ſeen were ſpies
of the marquis;—if ſo, her aſylum was
diſcovered, and ſhe had every thing to
apprehend. Madame now judged it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the ſafety of Julia, that the
Abate ſhould be informed of her ſtory,
and of the ſanctuary ſhe had ſought in
his monaſtery, and alſo that he ſhould
be ſolicited to protect her from parent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
tyranny. This was a hazardous,
but a neceſſary ſtep to provide againſt
the certain danger which muſt enſue,
ſhould the marquis, if he demanded
his daughter of the Abate, be the firſt
to acquaint him with her ſtory. If ſhe
acted otherwiſe, ſhe feared that the Abate,
in whoſe generoſity ſhe had not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0793800202:55"/>
and whoſe pity ſhe had not ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
would, in the pride of his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
deliver her up, and thus would
ſhe become a certain victim to the duke
de Luovo.</p>
            <p>Julia approved of this communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though ſhe trembled for the event;
and requeſted Madame to plead her
cauſe with the Abate. On the following
morning, therefore, Madame ſolicited a
private audience of the Abate; ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
permiſſion to ſee him, and Julia
in trembling anxiety, watched her to
the door of his apartment. The confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
was long, and every moment
ſeemed an hour to Julia, who, in fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
expectation, awaited with Cornelia
the ſentence which would decide her
deſtiny. She was now the conſtant
companion of Cornelia, whoſe declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
health intereſted her pity, and
ſtrengthened her attachment.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Madame developed to the
Abate the diſtreſsful ſtory of Julia. She
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0793800202:56"/>
praiſed her virtues, commended her
accompliſhments, and deplored her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.
She deſcribed the characters
of the marquis and the duke, and
concluded with pathetically repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that Julia had ſought in this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,
a laſt aſylum from injuſtice and
miſery, and with entreating that the
Abate would grant her his pity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
            <p>The Abate during this diſcourſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
a ſullen ſilence; his eyes were
bent to the ground, and his aſpect was
thoughtful and ſolemn. When Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
ceaſed to ſpeak, a pauſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
ſilence enſued, and ſhe fat in anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
expectation. She endeavoured to
anticipate in his countenance the anſwer
preparing, but ſhe derived no comfort
from thence. At length raiſing his
head, and awakening from his deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie,
he told her that her requeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
deliberation, and that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
ſhe ſolicited for Julia, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0793800202:57"/>
him in ſerious conſequences, ſince
from a character ſo determined as the
marquis's, much violence might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
be expected. "Should his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be refuſed him," concluded the
Abate, "he may even dare to violate
the ſanctuary."</p>
            <p>Madame ſhocked by the ſtern indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of this reply, was a moment
ſilent. The Abate went on. "What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I ſhall determine upon, the young
lady has reaſon to rejoice that ſhe is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into this holy houſe; for I will
even now venture to aſſure her, that if the
marquis fails to demand her, ſhe ſhall
be permitted to remain in this ſanctuary
unmoleſted. You, Madam, will be
ſenſible of this indulgence, and of the
value of the ſacrifice I make in granting
it; for in thus concealing a child from
her parent, I encourage her in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and conſequently ſacrifice my
ſenſe of duty, to what may be juſtly
called a weak humanity."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0793800202:58"/>
Madame liſtened to this pompous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
in ſilent ſorrow and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
She made another effort to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
the Abate in favour of Julia, but
he preſerved his ſtern inflexibility, and
repeating that he would deliberate upon
the matter, and acquaint her with the
reſult he aroſe with great ſolemnity,
and quitted the room.</p>
            <p>She now half repented of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ſhe had repoſed in him, and of
the pity ſhe had ſolicited, ſince he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
a mind incapable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the firſt, and a temper inacceſſible
to the influence of the latter. With an
heavy heart ſhe returned to Julia, who
read in her countenance, at the moment
ſhe entered the room, news of no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
import. When Madame related the
particulars of the conference, Julia pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaged
from it only miſery, and giving
herſelf up for loſt—ſhe burſt into tears.
She ſeverely deplored the confidence
ſhe had been induced to yield; for ſhe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0793800202:59"/>
now ſaw herſelf in the power of a man,
ſtern and unfeeling in his nature; and
from whom, if he thought it fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
her, ſhe had no means of eſcaping.
But ſhe concealed the anguiſh of her
heart; and to conſole Madame, affected
to hope where ſhe could only deſpair.</p>
            <p>Several days elapſed, and no anſwer
was returned from the Abate. Julia
too well underſtood this ſilence.</p>
            <p>One morning Cornelia entering her
room with a diſturbed and impatient
air, informed her that ſome emiſſaries
from the marquis were then in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,
having enquired at the gate for
the Abate, with whom, they ſaid, they
had buſineſs of importance to tranſact.
The Abate had granted them immediate
audience, and they were now in cloſe
conference.</p>
            <p>At this intelligence the ſpirits of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
forſook her; ſhe trembled, grew pale,
and ſtood fixed in mute deſpair. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
though ſcarcely leſs diſtreſſed,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0793800202:60"/>
retained a preſence of mind. She un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
too juſtly the character of the
Superior, to doubt that he would heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
in delivering Julia to the hands of
the marquis. On this moment, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
turned the criſis of her fate!—this
moment ſhe might eſcape—the next ſhe
was a priſoner. She therefore adviſed
Julia to ſeize the inſtant, and fly from
the monaſtery before the conference was
concluded, when the gates would moſt
probably be cloſed upon her, aſſuring
her, at the ſame time, ſhe would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
her in flight.</p>
            <p>The generous conduct of Madame
called tears of gratitude into the eyes of
Julia, who now awoke from the ſtate of
ſtupefaction which diſtreſs had cauſed.
But before ſhe could thank her faithful
friend, a nun entered the room with a
ſummons for Madame to attend the
abate immediately. The diſtreſs which
this meſſage occaſioned can not eaſily be
conceived. Madame adviſed Julia to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0793800202:61"/>
eſcape while ſhe detained the Abate in
converſation, as it was not probable that
he had yet iſſued orders for her detention.
Leaving her to this attempt, with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of following her from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
as ſoon as poſſible, Madame obeyed
the ſummons. The coolneſs of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
forſook her as ſhe approached the
Abate's apartment, and ſhe became leſs
certain as to the occaſion of this ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p>The Abate was alone. His counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
was pale with anger, and he was
pacing the room with ſlow but agitated
ſteps. The ſtern authority of his look
ſtartled her. "Read this letter," ſaid
he, ſtretching forth his hand which
held a letter, "and tell me what that
mortal deſerves, who dares inſult our
holy order, and ſet our ſacred preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
at defiance." Madame diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the hand writing of the marquis, and
the words of the Superior threw her into
the utmoſt aſtoniſhment. She took the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0793800202:62"/>
letter. It was dictated by that ſpirit of
proud vindictive rage, which ſo ſtrongly
marked the character of the marquis.
Having diſcovered the retreat of Julia,
and believing the monaſtery afforded
her a willing ſanctuary from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,
he accuſed the Abate of encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his child in open rebellion to his
will. He loaded him and his ſacred
order with opprobrium, and threatened,
if ſhe was not immediately reſigned to
the emiſſaries in waiting, he would in
perſon lead on a force which ſhould
compel the church to yield to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
authority of the father.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of the Abate was rouſed by
this menace; and Julia obtained from
his pride, that protection which neither
his principle nor his humanity would
have granted. "The man ſhall trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,"
cried he,"who dares defy our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or queſtion our ſacred authority.
The lady Julia is ſafe. I will protect
her from this proud invader of our
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0793800202:63"/>
rights, and teach him at leaſt to vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the power he cannot conquer. I
have diſpatched his emiſſaries with my
anſwer."</p>
            <p>Theſe words ſtruck ſudden joy upon
the heart of Madame de Menon, but
ſhe inſtantly recollected, that ere this
time Julia had quitted the abbey, and
thus the very precaution which was
meant to enſure her ſafety, had probably
precipitated her into the hand of her
enemy. This thought changed her joy
to anguiſh; and ſhe was hurrying from
the apartment in a ſort of wild hope,
that Julia might not yet be gone, when
the ſternv oice of the Abate arreſted her.
"Is it thus," cried he,"that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the knowledge of our generous
reſolution to protect your friend? Does
ſuch condeſcending kindneſs merit no
thanks—demand no gratitude?" Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
returned in an agony of fear, left
one moment of delay might prove fatal
to Julia, if haply ſhe had not yet
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0793800202:64"/>
quitted the monaſtery. She was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of her deficiency in apparent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and of the ſtrange appearance of
her abrupt departure from the Abate,
for which it was impoſſible to apologize,
without betraying the ſecret, which
would kindle all his reſentment. Yet ſome
atonement his preſent anger demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and theſe circumſtances cauſed her
a very painful embaraſſment. She
formed a haſty excuſe; and expreſſing
her ſenſe of his goodneſs, again at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to retire, when the Abate frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in deep reſentment, his features in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with pride, aroſe from his ſeat.
"Stay," ſaid he, "whence this impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to fly from the preſence of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor?—If
my generoſity fails to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
gratitude, my reſentment ſhall not
fail to inſpire awe.—Since the lady Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
is inſenſible of my condeſcenſion, ſhe
is unworthy of my protection, and I will
reſign her to the tyrant who demands
her."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0793800202:65"/>
To this ſpeech, in which the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
pride of the Abate overcoming all
ſenſe of juſtice, accuſed and threatened
to puniſh Julia for the fault of her
friend, Madame liſtened in dreadful
impatience. Every word that detained
her ſtruck torture to her heart, but the
concluding ſentence occaſioned new ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and ſhe ſtarted at its purpoſe. She
fell at the feet of the Abate in an agony
of grief. "Holy father," ſaid ſhe,
"puniſh not Julia for the offence which
I only have committed; her heart
will bleſs her generous protector, and
for myſelf, ſuffer me to aſſure you that
I am fully ſenſible of your goodneſs."</p>
            <p>"If this is true," ſaid the Abate,
"ariſe,and bid the lady Julia attend me."
This command increaſed the confuſion
of Madame, who had no doubt that her
detention had proved fatal to Julia. At
length ſhe was ſuffered to depart, and
to her infinite joy found Julia in her
own room. Her intention of eſcaping
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0793800202:66"/>
had yielded immediately after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of Madame, to the fear of being
diſcovered by the marquis's people.
This fear had been confirmed by the
report of Cornelia, who informed her,
that at that time ſeveral horſemen were
waiting at the gates for the return of
their companions. This was a dreadful
circumſtance to Julia, who perceived it
was utterly impoſſible to quit the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,
without ruſhing upon certain
deſtruction. She was lamenting her
deſtiny, when Madame recited the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of the late interview, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the ſummons of the Abate.</p>
            <p>They had now to dread the effect of
that tender anxiety, which had excited his
reſentment; and Julia ſuddenly elated to
joy by his firſt determination, was as
ſuddenly ſunk to deſpair by his laſt. She
trembled with apprehenſion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
interview, though each moment of
delay, which her fear ſolicited, would by
heightening the reſentment of the Abate,
only increaſe the danger ſhe dreaded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0793800202:67"/>
At length by a ſtrong effort ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated
her ſpirits, and went to the
Abate's cloſet to receive her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
He was ſeated in his chair, and
his frowning aſpect chilled her heart.
"Daughter," ſaid he, "you have been
guilty of heinous crimes. You have
dared to diſpute—nay openly to rebel,
againſt the lawful authority of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
You have diſobeyed the will of
him whoſe prerogative yields only to
ours. You have queſtioned his right
upon a point of all others the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided—the
right of a father to diſpoſe
of his child in marriage. You have
even fled from his protection—and you
have dared—inſidiouſly, and meanly
have dared, to ſcreen your diſobedience
beneath this ſacred roof. You have
prophaned our ſanctuary with your
crime. You have brought inſult upon
our ſacred order, and have cauſed bold
and impious defiance of our high prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.
What puniſhment is adequate
to guilt like this?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0793800202:68"/>
The father pauſed—his eyes ſternly
fixed on Julia, who pale and trembling,
could ſcarcely ſupport herſelf, and who
had no power to reply. "I will be
merciful, and not juſt," reſumed he,—"I
will ſoften the puniſhment you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
and will only deliver you to your
father." At theſe dreadful words, Julia
burſting into tears, ſunk at the feet of
the Abate, to whom ſhe raiſed her eyes
in ſupplicating expreſſion, but was
unable to ſpeak. He ſuffered her to
remain in this poſture. "Your dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,"
he reſumed, "is not the leaſt of
your offences.—Had you relied upon
our generoſity for forgiveneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
an indulgence might have been
granted;—but under the diſguiſe of
virtue you concealed your crimes, and
your neceſſities were hid beneath the
maſk of devotion."</p>
            <p>Theſe falſe aſperſions rouſed in Julia
the ſpirit of indignant virtue; ſhe aroſe
from her knees with an air of dignity,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0793800202:69"/>
that ſtruck even the Abate. "Holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,"
ſaid ſhe, "my heart abhors the
crime you mention, and diſclaims all
union with it. Whatever are my offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces—from
the ſin of hypocriſy I am at
leaſt free; and you will pardon me if I
remind you, that my confidence has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
been ſuch, as fully juſtifies my
claim to the protection I ſolicit. When
I ſheltered myſelf within theſe walls, it
was to be preſumed that they would
protect me from injuſtice; and with
what other term than injuſtice would
you, Sir, diſtinguiſh the conduct of
the marquis, if the fear of his power
did not overcome the dictates of truth?"</p>
            <p>The Abate felt the full force of this
reproof; but diſdaining to appear ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to it, reſtrained his reſentment. His
wounded pride thus exaſperated, and all
the malignant paſſions of his nature thus
called into action, he was prompted to
that cruel ſurrender which he had never
before ſeriouſly intended. The offence
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0793800202:70"/>
which Madame de Menon had unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally
given, his haughty ſpirit
urged him to retaliate in puniſhment.
He had, therefore, pleaſed himſelf with
exciting a terror which he never meant
to confirm, and he reſolved to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſolicited for that protection which
he had already determined to grant.
But this reproof of Julia touched him
where he was moſt conſcious of defect;
and the temporary triumph which he
imagined it afforded her, kindled his
reſentment into flame. He muſed in
his chair, in a fixed attitude.—She ſaw
in his countenance the deep workings
of his mind—ſhe revolved the fate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for her, and ſtood in trembling
anxiety to receive her ſentence. The
Abate conſidered each aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of the marquis's menace, and
each ſentence of Julia's ſpeech; and his
mind experienced, that vice is not only
inconſiſtent with virtue, but with itſelf—for
to gratify his malignity, he now
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0793800202:71"/>
diſcovered that it would be neceſſary to
ſacrifice his pride—ſince it would be
impoſſible to puniſh the object of the
firſt, without denying himſelf the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the former. This reflection
ſuſpended his mind in a ſtate of torture,
and he ſat wrapt in gloomy ſilence.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit which lately animated Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
had vaniſhed with her words—each
moment of ſilence increaſed her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion;
the deep brooding of his
thoughts confirmed her in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of evil, and with all the
artleſs eloquence of ſorrow, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to ſoften him to pity. He
liſtened to her pleadings in ſullen ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
But each inſtant now cooled the
fervour of his reſentment to her, and
increaſed his deſire of oppoſing the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis.
At length the predominant fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his character reſumed its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
influence, and overcame the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of ſubordinate paſſion. Proud of
his religious authority, he determined
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0793800202:72"/>
never to yield the prerogative of the
church to that of the father, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to oppoſe the violence of the
marquis with equal force.</p>
            <p>He therefore condeſcended to relieve
Julia from her terrors, by aſſuring her
of his protection; but he did this in
a manner ſo ungracious, as almoſt to
deſtroy the gratitude which the promiſe
demanded. She haſtened with the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
intelligence to Madame de Menon,
who wept over her tears of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

            <p>NEAR a fortnight had elapſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
producing an appearance of
hoſtility from the marquis, when one
night, long after the hour of repoſe,
Julia was awakened by the bell of the
monaſtery. She knew it was not the hour
cuſtomary for prayer, and ſhe liſtened
to the ſounds, which rolled through the
deep ſilence of the fabric, with ſtrong
ſurprize and terror. Preſently ſhe heard
the doors of ſeveral cells creak on their
hinges, and the ſound of quick foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
in the paſſages—and through the
crevices of her door ſhe diſtinguiſhed
paſſing lights. The whiſpering noiſe
of ſteps increaſed, and every perſon of
the monaſtery ſeemed to have awakened.
Her terror heightened; it occurred to
her that the marquis had ſurrounded
the abbey with his people, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of forcing her from her retreat;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0793800202:74"/>
and ſhe aroſe in haſte, with an intention
of going to the chamber of Madame de
Menon, when ſhe heard a gentle tap at
the door. Her enquiry of who was
there, was anſwered in the voice of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
and her fears were quickly diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
for ſhe learned the bell was a
ſummons to attend a dying nun, who
was going to the high altar, there to
receive extreme unction.</p>
            <p>She quitted the chamber with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame.
In her way to the church, the
gleam of tapers on the walls, and the
glimpſe which her eye often caught
of the friars in their long black habits,
deſcending ſilently through the narrow
winding paſſages, with the ſolemn toll
of the bell, conſpired to kindle imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to impreſs her heart with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
awe. But the church exhibited a
ſcene of ſolemnity, ſuch as ſhe had never
before witneſſed. Its gloomy aiſles were
imperfectly ſeen by the rays of tapers
from the high altar, which ſhed a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0793800202:75"/>
gleam over the remote parts of the fabric,
and produced large maſſes of
light and ſhade, ſtriking and ſublime
in their effect.</p>
            <p>While ſhe gazed, ſhe heard a diſtant
chanting riſe through the aiſles; the
ſounds ſwelled in low murmurs on the
ear, and drew nearer and nearer, till a
ſudden blaze of light iſſued from one of
the portals, and the proceſſion entered.
The organ inſtantly ſounded a high and
ſolemn peal, and the voices riſing alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
ſwelled the ſacred ſtrain. In
front appeared the <hi>Padre Abate,</hi> with
ſlow and meaſured ſteps, bearing the
holy croſs. Immediately followed a
litter, on which lay the dying perſon
covered with a white veil, borne along,
and ſurrounded by nuns veiled in white,
each carrying in her hand a lighted
taper. Laſt came the friars,
two and two, cloathed in black, and each bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a light.</p>
            <p>When they reached the high altar
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0793800202:76"/>
the bier was reſted, and in a few moments
the anthem ceaſed. The Abate now
approached to perform the unction; the
veil of the dying nun was lifted—and
Julia diſcovered her beloved Cornelia!
Her countenance was already impreſſed
with the image of death, but her eyes
brightened with a faint gleam of recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
when they fixed upon Julia,
who felt a cold thrill run through her
frame, and leaned for ſupport on Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame.
Julia now for the firſt time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
the unhappy lover of Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
on whoſe features was depictured
the anguiſh of his heart, and who hung
pale and ſilent over the bier. The ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
being finiſhed, the anthem
ſtruck up; the bier was lifted, when
Cornelia faintly moved her hand, and it
was again reſted upon the ſteps of the
altar. In a few minutes the muſic ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
when lifting her heavy eyes to her
lover, with an expreſſion of ineffable
tenderneſs and grief, ſhe attempted to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0793800202:77"/>
ſpeak, but the ſounds died on her cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lips. A faint ſmile paſſed over
her countenance, and was ſucceeded
by a fine devotional glow; ſhe folded
her hands upon her boſom, and with a
look of meek reſignation, raiſing tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
heaven her eyes, in which now
ſunk the laſt ſparkles of expiring life—her
ſoul departed in a ſhort deep ſigh.</p>
            <p>Her lover ſinking back, endeavoured
to conceal his emotions, but the deep
ſobs which agitated his breaſt, betrayed
his anguiſh, and the tears of every ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator
bedewed the ſacred ſpot where
beauty, ſenſe, and innocence expired.</p>
            <p>The organ now ſwelled in mournful
harmony; and the voices of the aſſembly
chanted in choral ſtrain, a low and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
requiem to the ſpirit of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>Madame hurried Julia, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as lifeleſs as her departed friend,
from the church. A death ſo ſudden,
heightened the grief which ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0793800202:78"/>
would otherwiſe have occaſioned.
It was the nature of Cornelia's diſorder,
to wear a changeful but flattering aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.
Though ſhe had long been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining,
her decay was ſo gradual and
imperceptible, as to lull the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of her friends into ſecurity.
It was otherwiſe with herſelf; ſhe was conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of the change, but forbore to afflict
them with the knowledge of the truth.
The hour of her diſſolution was ſudden,
even to herſelf; but it was compoſed,
and even happy. In the death of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia
Julia ſeemed to mourn again that
of Hippolitus. Her deceaſe appeared
to diſſolve the laſt tie which connected
her with his memory.</p>
            <p>In one of the friars of the convent,
Madame was ſurprized to find the father
who had confeſſed the dying Vincent.
His appearance revived the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the ſcene ſhe had witneſſed at
the caſtle of Mazzini; and the laſt
words of Vincent, combined with the
circumſtances which had ſince oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0793800202:79"/>
renewed all her curioſity and
aſtoniſhment. But his appearance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
more ſenſations than thoſe of
wonder. She dreaded, leſt he ſhould
be corrupted by the marquis, to whom
he was known, and thus be induced to
uſe his intereſt with the <hi>Abate</hi> for the
reſtoration of Julia.</p>
            <p>From the walls of the monaſtery, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
now never ventured to ſtray. In the
glooms of evening ſhe ſometimes ſtole
into the cloiſters, and often lingered at
the grave of Cornelia, where ſhe wept
for Hippolitus, as well as for her friend.
One evening, during veſpers, the bell
of the convent was ſuddenly rang out;
the <hi>Abate,</hi> whoſe countenance expreſſed
at once aſtoniſhment and diſpleaſure,
ſuſpended the ſervice, and quitted the altar.
The whole congregation repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the hall, where they learned that
a friar, retiring to the convent, had ſeen
a troop of armedmen advancing through
the wood; and not doubting they were
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0793800202:80"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> people of the marquis, and were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
with hoſtile intention, had
thought it neceſſary to give the alarm.
The <hi>Abate</hi> aſcended a turret, and thence
diſcovered through the trees a glittering
of arms, and in the ſucceeding moment
a band of men iſſued from a dark part
of the wood, into a long avenue which
immediately fronted the ſpot where he
ſtood. The clattering of hoofs was now
diſtinctly heard; and Julia, ſinking with
terror, diſtinguiſhed the marquis head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the troop, which ſoon after ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into two diviſions, ſurrounded the
monaſtery. The gates were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ſecured; and the <hi>Abate,</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
from the turret, aſſembled
the friars in the hall, where his voice
was ſoon heard above every other part
of the tumult. The terror of Julia
made her utterly forgetful of the <hi>Padre's</hi>
promiſe, and ſhe wiſhed to fly for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment
to the deep caverns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the monaſtery, which wound
under the woods. Madame, whoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0793800202:81"/>
furniſhed her with a juſt-know
ledge of the <hi>Abate's</hi> character, founded
her ſecurity on his pride. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
diſſuaded Julia from attempting to
tamper with the honeſty of a ſervant
who had the keys of the vaults, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
her to rely entirely on the effort of
the <hi>Abate's</hi> reſentment towards the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis.
While Madame endeavoured to
ſoothe her to compoſure, a meſſage from
the <hi>Abate,</hi> required her immediate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
She obeyed, and he bade her fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him to a room which was directly
over the gates of the monaſtery. From
thence ſhe ſaw her father, accompanied
by the duke de Luovo; and as her heart
died away at the ſight, the marquis called
furiouſly to the <hi>Abate</hi> to deliver her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
into his hands, threatening, if ſhe
was detained, to force the gates of the
monaſtery. At this threat the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the <hi>Abate</hi> grew dark; and
leading Julia forcibly to the window,
from which ſhe had ſhrunk back, "Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0793800202:82"/>
menacer!" ſaid he, "eternal ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
be upon thee! From this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we expel thee from all the rights
and communities of our church. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant
and daring as you are, your
threats I defy." "Look here," ſaid
he, pointing to Julia, "and learn that
you are in my power; for if you dare
to violate theſe ſacred walls, I will
proclaim aloud in the face of day, a
ſecret which ſhall make your heart's
blood run cold; a ſecret which involves
your honour, nay, your very exiſtence.
Now triumph and exult in impious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace!"
The marquis ſtarted involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
at this ſpeech, and his features un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent
a ſudden change, but he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to recover himſelf, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
his confuſion. He heſitated for a
few moments, uncertain how to act—to
deſiſt from violence was to confeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
conſcious of the threatened ſecret;
yet he dreaded to inflame the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Abate,</hi> whoſe menaces his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0793800202:83"/>
own heart too ſurely ſeconded. At
length—"All that you have uttered,"
ſaid he, "I deſpiſe as the daſtardly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge
of monkiſh cunning. Your
new inſults add to the deſire of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my daughter, that of puniſhing you.
I would proceed to inſtant violence, but
that would now be an imperfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
I ſhall therefore withdraw my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and appeal to a higher power. Thus
ſhall you be compelled at once to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
my daughter, and retract your
ſcandalous impeachment of my honour
" Saying this, he turned his horſe
from the gates, and his people following him,
quickly withdrew, leaving the <hi>Abate</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting
in conqueſt, and Julia loſt in aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
and doubtful joy. When ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to Madame the particulars of the
conference, ſhe dwelt with emphaſis on
the threats of the <hi>Abate;</hi> but Madame,
though her amazement was heightened
at every word, very well underſtood
how the ſecret, whatever it was, had
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0793800202:84"/>
been obtained. The confeſſor of Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
ſhe had already obſerved in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,
and there was no doubt that
he had diſcloſed whatever could be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
from the dying words of Vincent.
She knew, alſo, that the ſecret would
never be publiſhed, unleſs as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for immediate violence, it being
one of the firſt principles of monaſtic
duty, to obſerve a religious ſecrecy upon
all matters intruſted to them in conſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>When the firſt tumult of Julia's emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſubſided, the joy which the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
departure of the marquis occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yielded to apprehenſion. He had
threatened to appeal to a higher power,
who would compel the <hi>Abate</hi> to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her. This menace excited a juſt
terror, and there remained no means of
avoiding the tyranny of the marquis, but
by quitting the monaſtery. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
requeſted an audience of the <hi>Abate;</hi>
and having repreſented the danger of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0793800202:85"/>
her preſent ſituation, ſhe intreated his
permiſſion to depart in queſt of a ſafer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.
The <hi>Abate,</hi> who well knew the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
was wholly in his power, laughed
at the repetition of his menaces, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
her requeſt, under pretence of his
having now become reſponſible for her
to the church. He bade her be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
and promiſed her his protection;
but his aſſurances were given in ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
and haughty a manner, that Julia
left him with fears, rather increaſed than
ſubdued. In croſſing the hall, ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
a man haſtily enter it from an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
door. He was not in the habit
of the order, but was muffled up in a
cloak, and ſeemed to wiſh concealment.
As ſhe paſſed he raiſed his head, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
diſcovered—her father! He darted
at her a look of vengeance; but, before
ſhe had time even to think, as if ſuddenly
recollecting himſelf, he covered his face,
and ruſhed by her. Her trembling
frame could ſcarcely ſupport her to the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0793800202:86"/>
apartment of Madame, where ſhe ſunk
ſpeechleſs upon a chair, and the horror
of her look alone ſpoke the agony of
her mind. When ſhe was ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
ſhe related what ſhe had ſeen,
and her converſation with the <hi>Abate.</hi>
But Madame was loſt in equal perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with herſelf, when ſhe attempted to
account for the marquis's appearance.
Why, after his late daring menace,
ſhould he come ſecretly to viſit the
<hi>Abate,</hi> by whoſe connivance alone he
could have gained admiſſion to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery?
And what could have influenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Abate</hi> to ſuch a conduct? Theſe
circumſtances, though equally inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable,
united to confirm a fear of
treachery and ſurrender. To eſcape
from the abbey was now impracticable,
for the gates were conſtantly guarded;
and even was it poſſible to paſs them,
certain detection awaited Julia with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
from the marquis's people, who
were ſtationed in the woods. Thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0793800202:87"/>
with danger, ſhe could only
await in the monaſtery the iſſue of her
deſtiny.</p>
            <p>While ſhe was lamenting with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
her unhappy ſtate, ſhe was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
once more to attend the <hi>Abate.</hi>
At this moment her ſpirits entirely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
her; the criſis of her fate ſeemed
arrived; for ſhe did not doubt that the
<hi>Abate</hi> intended to ſurrender her to the
marquis, with whom ſhe ſuppoſed he
had negociated the terms of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
It was ſome time before ſhe
could recover compoſure ſufficient to
obey the ſummons; and when ſhe did,
every ſtep that bore her towards the
<hi>Abate</hi>'s room, increaſed her dread. She
pauſed a moment at the door, 'ere ſhe
had courage to open it; the idea of
her father's immediate reſentment aroſe
to her mind, and ſhe was upon the point
of retreating to her chamber, when a
ſudden ſtep within, near the door, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed
her heſitation, and ſhe entered the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0793800202:88"/>
cloſet. The marquis was not there,
and her ſpirits revived. The fluſh of
triumph was diffuſed over the features
of the <hi>Abate,</hi> though a ſhade of unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed
reſentment yet remained viſible.
"Daughter," ſaid he, "the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
we have to communicate may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
you. Your ſafety now depends
ſolely on yourſelf. I give your fate
into your own hands, and its iſſue be
upon your head." He pauſed, and
ſhe was ſuſpended in wondering ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the coming ſentence. "I
here ſolemnly aſſure you of my protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but it is upon one condition only—that
you renounce the world, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
your days to God." Julia liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a mixture of grief and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
"Without this conceſſion on
your part, I poſſeſs not the power, had
I even the inclination, to protect you.
If you aſſume the veil, you are ſafe
within the pale of the church from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
violence. If you neglect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0793800202:89"/>
to do this, the marquis may apply
to a power from whom I have no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
and I ſhall be compelled at laſt to
reſign you."</p>
            <p>"But to enſure your ſafety, ſhould
the veil be your choice, we will procure
a diſpenſation from the uſual forms of
noviciation, and a few days ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
your vows." He ceaſed to ſpeak;
but Julia, agitated with the moſt cruel
diſtreſs, knew not what to reply. "We
grant you three days to decide upon
this matter," continued he, "at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
of which, the veil, or the duke
de Luovo, awaits you." Julia quitted
the cloſet in mute deſpair, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to Madame, who could now
ſcarcely offer her the humble benefit of
conſolation.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the <hi>Abate</hi> exulted in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
vengeance, and the marquis
ſmarted beneath the ſtings of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The menace of the former was too
ſeriouſly alarming to ſuffer the marquis
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0793800202:90"/>
to proſecute violent meaſures; and he
had therefore reſolved, by oppoſing ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
to pride, to ſoothe the power which
he could not ſubdue. But he was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to entruſt the <hi>Abate</hi> with a proof
of his compliance and his fears, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
a bribe in a letter, and preferred
the more humiliating, but ſafer method,
of a private interview. His magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
offers created a temporary heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the mind of the <hi>Abate,</hi> who, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
of his advantage, ſhewed at firſt no
diſpoſition to be reconciled, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the marquis to depart in anxious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty.
After maturely deliberating
upon the propoſals, the pride of the
<hi>Abate</hi> ſurmounted his avarice; and he
determined to prevail upon Julia effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to deſtroy the hopes of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
by conſecrating her life to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Julia paſſed the night and the
next day in a ſtate of mental torture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
all deſcription. The gates of
the monaſtery beſet with guards, and the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0793800202:91"/>
woods ſurrounded by the marquis's
people, made eſcape impoſſible. From
a marriage with the duke, whoſe late
conduct had confirmed the odious idea
which his character had formerly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
her heart recoiled in horror,
and to be immured for life within the
walls of a convent, was a fate little leſs
dreadful. Yet ſuch was the effect of
that ſacred love ſhe bore the memory
of Hippolitus, and ſuch her averſion to
the duke, that ſhe ſoon reſolved to
adopt the veil. On the following even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhe informed the <hi>Abate</hi> of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.
His heart ſwelled with
ſecret joy; and even the natural ſeverity
of his manner relaxed at the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
He aſſured her of his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and protection, with a degree of
kindneſs which he had never before
manifeſted, and told her the ceremony
ſhould be performed on the ſecond day
from the preſent. Her emotion ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuffered her to hear his laſt words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0793800202:92"/>
Now that her fate was fixed beyond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
ſhe almoſt repented of her choice.
Her fancy attached to it a horror not
its own; and that evil, which, when
offered to her deciſion, ſhe had accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with little heſitation, ſhe now pauſed
upon in dubious regret; ſo apt we are
to imagine that the calamity moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
is alſo the moſt intolerable!</p>
            <p>When the marquis read the anſwer of
the <hi>Abate,</hi> all the baleful paſſions of his
nature were rouſed and inflamed to a
degree which bordered upon diſtraction.
In the firſt impulſe of his rage, he
would have forced the gates of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,
and defied the utmoſt malice
of his enemy. But a moment's reflection
revived his fear of the threatened ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
and he ſaw that he was ſtill in the
power of the Superior.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Abate</hi> procured the neceſſary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
and preparations were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
began for the approaching ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony.
Julia watched the departure
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0793800202:93"/>
of thoſe moments which led to her fate
with the calm fortitude of deſpair. She
had no means of eſcaping from the
coming evil, without expoſing herſelf to
a worſe; ſhe ſurveyed it therefore with
a ſteady eye, and no longer ſhrunk from
its approach.</p>
            <p>On the morning preceding the day
of her conſecration, ſhe was informed
that a ſtranger enquired for her at the
grate. Her mind had been ſo long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to the viciſſitudes of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
that fear was the emotion which
now occurred; ſhe ſuſpected, yet ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knew why, that the marquis was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and heſitated whether to deſcend.
A little reflection determined her, and
ſhe went to the parlour—where to
her equal joy and ſurprize ſhe beheld—Ferdinand!</p>
            <p>During the abſence of the marquis
from his caſtle, Ferdinand, who had
been informed of the diſcovery of Julia,
effected his eſcape from impriſonment,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0793800202:94"/>
and had haſtened to the monaſtery in the
deſign of reſcuing her. He had paſſed
the woods in diſguiſe, with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
eluding the obſervation of the
marquis's people, who were yet diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
round the abbey. To the monaſtery,
as he came alone, he had been admitted
without difficulty.</p>
            <p>When he learned the conditions of
the <hi>Abate</hi>'s protection, and that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
day was appointed for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration
of Julia, he was ſhocked, and
pauſed in deliberation. A period ſo
ſhort as was this interval, afforded little
opportunity for contrivance, and leſs
for heſitation. The night of the preſent
day was the only time that remained for
the attempt and execution of a plan of
eſcape, which if it then failed of ſucceſs,
Julia would not only be condemned for
life to the walls of a monaſtery, but
would be ſubjected to whatever puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the ſeverity of the <hi>Abate,</hi> exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by the detection, ſhould think fit
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0793800202:95"/>
to inflict. The danger was deſperate,
but the occaſion was deſperate alſo.</p>
            <p>The nobly diſintereſted conduct of
her brother, ſtruck Julia with gratitude
and admiration; but deſpair of ſucceſs,
made her now heſitate whether ſhe
ſhould accept his offer. She conſidered
that his generoſity would moſt probably
involve him in deſtruction with herſelf;
and ſhe pauſed in deep deliberation,
when Ferdinand informed her of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
which, till now, he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
concealed, and which at once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
every doubt and every fear.
"Hippolitus," ſaid Ferdinand, "yet
lives." "Lives!" repeated Julia faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,—"lives!
Oh! tell me where—how."—Her
breath refuſed to aid her, and ſhe
ſunk in her chair, overcome with the
ſtrong and various ſenſations that preſſed
upon her heart. Ferdinand, whom the
grate with-held from aſſiſting her, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
her ſituation in extreme diſtreſs.
When ſhe recovered, he informed her
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0793800202:96"/>
that a ſervant of Hippolitus, ſent no
doubt by his lord to enquire concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Julia, had been lately ſeen by one
of the marquis's people in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of the caſtle. From him it
was known that the count de Vereza
was living, but that his life had been
deſpaired of; and he was ſtill confined,
by dangerous wounds, in an obſcure
town on the coaſt of Italy. The man
had ſteadily refuſed to mention the place
of his lord's abode. Learning that the
marquis was then at the abbey of St.
Auguſtin, whither he purſued his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the man diſappeared from Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zini,
and had not ſince been heard of.</p>
            <p>It was enough for Julia to know that
Hippolitus lived; her fears of detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and her ſcruples concerning Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,
inſtantly vaniſhed; ſhe thought
only of eſcape—and the means which
had lately appeared ſo formidable—ſo
difficult in contrivance, and ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in execution, now ſeemed eaſy,
certain, and almoſt accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0793800202:97"/>
They conſulted on the plan to be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and agreed, that in attempting to
bribe a ſervant of the monaſtery to their
intereſt, they ſhould incur a danger too
eminent, yet it appeared ſcarcely prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable
to ſucceed in their ſcheme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
riſquing this. After much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
they determined to entruſt
their ſecret to no perſon but to Madame.
Ferdinand was to contrive to conceal
himſelf till the dead of night in the
church, between which and the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
were ſeveral doors of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
When the inhabitants of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
were ſunk in repoſe, Julia might
without difficulty paſs to the church,
where Ferdinand awaiting her, they
might perhaps eſcape either through an
outer door of the fabric, or through a
window, for which latter attempt Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
was to provide ropes.</p>
            <p>A couple of horſes were to be ſtationed
among the rocks beyond the woods, to
convey the fugitives to a ſea-port, whence
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0793800202:98"/>
they could eaſily paſs over to Italy.
Having arranged this plan, they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
in the anxious hope of meeting
on the enſuing night.</p>
            <p>Madame warmly ſympathized with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
in her preſent expectations, and was
now ſomewhat relieved from the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of that ſelf reproach, with which the
conſideration of having withdrawn Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
from a ſecure aſylum, had long
tormented her. In learning that Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus
lived, Julia experienced a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
renovation of life and ſpirits. From
the languid ſtupefaction which deſpair
had occaſioned ſhe revived as from a
dream, and her ſenſations reſembled
thoſe of a perſon ſuddenly awakened
from a frightful viſion, whoſe thoughts
are yet obſcured in the fear and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
which the paſſing images have
impreſſed on his fancy. She emerged
from deſpair; joy illumined her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
yet ſhe doubted the reality of
the ſcene which now opened to her
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0793800202:99"/>
view. The hours rolled heavily along
till the evening, when expectation gave
way to fear, for ſhe was once more ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
by the <hi>Abate.</hi> He ſent for her
to adminiſter the uſual neceſſary exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
on the approaching ſolemnity;
and having detained her a conſiderable
time in tedious and ſevere diſcourſe,
diſmiſſed her with a formal benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="12" type="chapter">
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0793800202:100"/>
            <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
            <p>THE evening now ſunk in darkneſs,
and the hour was faſt approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which would decide the fate of Julia.
Trembling anxiety now ſubdued every
other ſenſation; and as the minutes
paſſed, her fears increaſed. At length
ſhe heard the gates of the monaſtery
faſtened for the night; the bell rang
the ſignal for repoſe; and the paſſing
footſteps of the nuns told her they were
haſtening to obey it. After ſome time,
all was ſilent. Julia did not yet dare to
venture forth; ſhe employed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
interval in interesting and affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
converſation with Madame de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
to whom, notwithſtanding her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
her heart bade a ſorrowful adieu.</p>
            <p>The clock ſtruck twelve, when ſhe
aroſe to depart. Having embraced her
faithful friend with tears of mingled
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0793800202:101"/>
grief and anxiety, ſhe took a lamp in
her hand, and with cautious, fearful
ſteps deſcended through the long wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſſages to a private door, which
opened into the church of the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.
The church was gloomy and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;
and the feeble rays of the lamp ſhe
bore, gave only light enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
its chilling grandeur. As ſhe
paſſed ſilently along the aiſles, ſhe caſt
a look of anxious examination around—but
Ferdinand was no where to be
ſeen. She pauſed in timid heſitation,
fearful to penetrate the gloomy obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which lay before her, yet dreading
to return.</p>
            <p>As ſhe ſtood examining the place,
vainly looking for Ferdinand, yet fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to call leſt her voice ſhould betray
her, a hollow groan aroſe from a part of
the church very near her. It chilled
her heart, and ſhe remained fixed to the
ſpot. She turned her eyes a little to
the left, and ſaw light appear through
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0793800202:102"/>
the chinks of a ſepulchre at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
The groan was repeated—a low
murmuring ſucceeded, and while ſhe
yet gazed, an old man iſſued from the
vault with a lighted taper in his hand.
Terror now ſubdued her, and ſhe utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an involuntary ſhriek. In the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
moment, a noiſe was heard in
a remote part of the fabric; and Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
ruſhing forth from his conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ran to her aſſiſtance. The old
man, who appeared to be a friar, and
who had been doing penance at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of a ſaint, now approached.
His countenance expreſſed a degree of
ſurprize and terror almoſt equal to that
of Julia's, who now knew him to be
the confeſſor of Vincent. Ferdinand
ſeized the father; and laying his hand
upon his ſword, threatened him with
death if he did not inſtantly ſwear to
conceal for ever his knowledge of what
he then ſaw, and alſo aſſiſt them to
eſcape from the abbey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0793800202:103"/>
"Ungracious boy!" replied the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a calm voice, "deſiſt from this
language, nor add to the follies of youth
the crime of murdering, or terrifying
a defenceleſs old man. Your violence
would urge me to become your enemy,
did not previous inclination tempt me
to be your friend. I pity the diſtreſſes
of the lady Julia, to whom I am no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and will cheerfully give her all the
aſſiſtance in my power."</p>
            <p>At theſe words Julia revived, and
Ferdinand, reproved by the generoſity
of the father, and conſcious of his own
inferiority, ſhrunk back. "I have no
words to thank you," ſaid he, "or to
entreat your pardon for the impetuoſity
of my conduct; your knowledge of my
ſituation muſt plead my excuſe." "It
does," replied the father, "but we
have no time to loſe;—follow me. "</p>
            <p>They followed him through the church
to the cloiſters, at the extremity of which
was a ſmall door, which the friar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked.
It opened upon the woods.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0793800202:104"/>
"This path," ſaid he, "leads
through an intricate part of the woods,
to the rocks that riſe on the right of the
abbey; in their receſſes you may ſecrete
yourſelves till you are prepared for a
longer journey. But extinguiſh your
light; it may betray you to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's
people, who are diſperſed about
this ſpot. Farewell! my children, and
God's bleſſing be upon ye."</p>
            <p>Julia's tears declared her gratitude;
ſhe had no time for words. They ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
into the path, and the father cloſed
the door. They were now liberated
from the monaſtery, but danger awaited
them without, which it required all their
caution to avoid. Ferdinand knew the
path which the friar had pointed out,
to be the ſame that led to the rocks
where his horſes were ſtationed, and he
purſued it with quick and ſilent ſteps.
Julia, whoſe fears conſpired with the
gloom of night to magnify and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
every object around her, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0793800202:105"/>
at each ſtep that ſhe took, ſhe
perceived the figures of men, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
every whiſper of the breeze the
ſound of purſuit.</p>
            <p>They proceeded ſwiftly, till Julia
breathleſs and exhauſted could go no
farther. They had not reſted many
minutes, when they heard a ruſtling
among the buſhes at ſome diſtance, and
ſoon after diſtinguiſhed a low ſound
of voices. Ferdinand and Julia inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
renewed their flight, and thought
they ſtill heard voices advance upon the
wind. This thought was ſoon confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for the ſounds now gained faſt upon
them, and they diſtinguiſhed words
which ſerved only to heighten their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
when they reached the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of the woods. The moon, which
was now up, ſuddenly emerging from
a dark cloud, diſcovered to them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
men in purſuit; and alſo ſhewed to
the purſuers the courſe of the fugitives.
They endeavoured to gain the rocks
where the horſes were concealed, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0793800202:106"/>
which now appeared in view. Theſe they
reached when the purſuers had almoſt
overtaken them—but their horſes were
gone! Their only remaining chance of
eſcape was to fly into the deep receſſes
of the rock. They, therefore, entered
a winding cave from whence branched
ſeveral ſubterraneous avenues, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of one of which they ſtopped.
The voices of men now vibrated in tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
echoes through the various
and ſecret caverns of the place, and the
ſound of footſteps ſeemed faſt approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Julia trembled with terror, and
Ferdinand drew his ſword, determined
to protect her to the laſt. A confuſed
volley of voices now ſounded up that
part of the cave where Ferdinand and
Julia lay concealed. In a few moments
the ſteps of the purſuers ſuddenly took
a different direction, and the ſounds
ſunk gradually away, and were heard no
more. Ferdinand liſtened attentively
for a conſiderable time, but the ſtillneſs
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0793800202:107"/>
of the place remained undiſturbed. It
was now evident that the men had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the rock, and he ventured forth to
the mouth of the cave. He ſurveyed
the wilds around, as far as his eye could
penetrate, and diſtinguiſhed no human
being; but in the pauſes of the wind he
ſtill thought he heard a ſound of diſtant
voices. As he liſtened in anxious ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
his eye caught the appearance of
a ſhadow, which moved upon the ground
near where he ſtood. He ſtarted back
within the cave, but in a few minutes
again ventured forth. The ſhadow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſtationary; but having watched
it for ſome time, Ferdinand ſaw it glide
along till it diſappeared behind a point
of rock. He had now no doubt that
the cave was watched, and that it was
one of his late purſuers whoſe ſhade
he had ſeen. He returned, therefore,
to Julia, and remained near an hour hid
in the deepeſt receſs of the rock; when,
no ſound having interrupted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0793800202:108"/>
ſilence of the place, he at length
once more ventured to the mouth of the
cave. Again he threw a fearful look
around, but diſcerned no human form.
The ſoft moon-beam ſlept upon the
dewy landſcape, and the ſolemn ſtillneſs
of midnight wrapt the world. Fear
heightened to the fugitives the ſublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the hour. Ferdinand now led Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
forth, and they paſſed ſilently along
the ſhelving foot of the rocks.</p>
            <p>They continued their way without
farther interruption; and among the
cliffs at ſome diſtance from the cave,
diſcovered to their inexpreſſible joy,
their horſes, who having broken their
faſtenings, had ſtrayed thither, and had
now laid themſelves down to reſt. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand
and Julia immediately mounted;
and deſcending to the plains, took the
road that led to a ſmall ſea port at ſome
leagues diſtance, whence they could
embark for Italy.</p>
            <p>They travelled for ſome hours through
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0793800202:109"/>
gloomy foreſts of beech and cheſnut;
and their way was only faintly illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by the moon, which ſhed a tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
luſtre through the dark foliage, and
which was ſeen but at intervals, as the
paſſing clouds yielded to the power of
her rays. They reached at length the
ſkirts of the foreſt. The grey dawn
now appeared, and the chill morning
air bit ſhrewdly. It was with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible
joy that Julia obſerved the
kindling atmoſphere; and ſoon after the
rays of the riſing ſun touching the tops
of the mountains, whoſe ſides were yet
involved in dark vapours.</p>
            <p>Her fears diſſipated with the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—The
ſun now appeared amid
clouds of inconceivable ſplendour; and
unveiled a ſcene which in other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
Julia would have contemplated
with rapture. From the ſide of the hill,
down which they were winding, a vale
appeared, from whence aroſe wild and
lofty mountains, whoſe ſides were cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0793800202:110"/>
with hanging woods, except where
here and there a precipice projected its
bold and rugged front. Here a few
half withered trees hung from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of the rock, and gave a pictureſque
wildneſs to the object; there cluſters of
half ſeen cottages, riſing from among
tufted groves, embelliſhed the green
margin of a ſtream which meandered in
the bottom, and bore its waves to the
blue and distant main.</p>
            <p>The freſhneſs of morning breathed
over the ſcene, and vivified each colour
of the landſcape. The bright dew-drops
hung trembling from the branches of
the trees, which at intervals overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
the road; and the ſprightly muſic
of the birds ſaluted the riſing day. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
her anxiety, the ſcene dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
a ſoft complacency over the mind
of Julia.</p>
            <p>About noon they reached the port,
where Ferdinand was fortunate enough
to obtain a ſmall veſſel; but the wind
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0793800202:111"/>
was unfavourable, and it was paſt mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
before it was poſſible for them to
embark.</p>
            <p>When the dawn appeared, Julia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the deck; and viewed with a
ſigh of unaccountable regret, the reced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
coaſt of Sicily. But ſhe obſerved
with high admiration, the light gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
ſpreading through the atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere,
darting a feeble ray over the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the waters, which rolled in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
ſoundings upon the diſtant ſhores.
Fiery beams now marked the clouds,
and the eaſt glowed with encreaſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diance,
till the ſun roſe at once above
the waves, and illuminating them with
a flood of ſplendour, diffuſed gaiety and
gladneſs around. The bold concave of
the heavens, uniting with the vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſe
of the ocean; formed a <hi>coup d'oeil,</hi>
ſtriking and ſublime. The magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of the ſcenery inſpired Julia with
delight; and her heart dilating with
high enthuſiaſm, ſhe forgot the ſorrows
which had oppreſſed her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0793800202:112"/>
The breeze waſted the ſhip gently along
for ſome hours, when it gradually ſunk
into a calm. The glaſſy ſurface of the
waters was not curled by the lighteſt air,
and the veſſel floated heavily on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
of the deep. Sicily was yet in view,
and the preſent delay agitated Julia with
wild apprehenſion. Towards the cloſe
of day a light breeze ſprang up, but it
blew from Italy, and a train of dark va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
emerged from the verge of the
horizon, which gradually accumulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the heavens became entirely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt.
The evening ſhut in ſuddenly:
the riſing wind, the heavy clouds that
loaded the atmoſphere, and the thunder
which murmured afar off, terrified Julia,
and threatened a violent ſtorm.</p>
            <p>The tempeſt came on, and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
vainly ſounded for anchorage: it
was deep ſea, and the veſſel drove furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
before the wind. The darkneſs
was interrupted only at intervals, by the
broad expanſe of vivid lightnings,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0793800202:113"/>
which quivered upon the waters, and
diſcloſing the horrible gaſpings of the
waves, ſerved to render the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
darkneſs more awful. The thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which burſt in tremendous craſhes
above, the loud roar of the waves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
the noiſe of the ſailors, and the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
cracks and groanings of the veſſel,
conſpired to heighten the tremendous
ſublimity of the ſcene.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Far on the rocky ſhores the ſurges ſound,</l>
               <l>The laſhing whirlwinds cleave the vaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found;</l>
               <l>While high in air, amid the riſing ſtorm,</l>
               <l>Driving the blaſt, ſits, Danger's black'ning form.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Julia lay fainting with terror and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the cabin, and Ferdinand though
almoſt hopeleſs himſelf was endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſupport her, when a loud and
dreadful craſh was heard from above.
It ſeemed as if the whole veſſel had
parted. The voices of the ſailors now
roſe together, and all was confuſion and
uproar. Ferdinand ran up to the deck,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0793800202:114"/>
and learned that the main maſt, borne
away by the wind, had fallen upon the
deck, whence it had rolled overboard.</p>
            <p>It was now paſt midnight, and the
ſtorm continued with unabated fury.
For four hours the veſſel had been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before the blaſt; and the captain
now declaring it was impoſſible ſhe
could weather the tempeſt much longer,
ordered the long boat to be in readineſs.
His orders were ſcarcely executed, when
the ſhip bulged upon a reef of rocks,
and the impetuous waves ruſhed into the
veſſel:—a general groan enſued. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand
flew to ſave his ſiſter, whom he
carried to the boat, which was nearly
filled by the captain and moſt of the
crew. The ſea ran ſo high that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
impracticable to reach the ſhore;
but the boat had not moved many
yards, when the ſhip went to pieces.
The captain now perceived by the ſlaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of lightning, a high rocky coaſt at
about the diſtance of half a mile. The
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0793800202:115"/>
men ſtruggled hard at the oars; but
almoſt as often as they gained the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of a wave, it daſhed them back
again, and made their labour of little
avail.</p>
            <p>After much difficulty and fatigue
they reached the coaſt, where a new dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
preſented itſelf. They beheld a
wild rocky ſhore, whoſe cliffs appeared
inacceſſible, and which ſeemed to afford
little poſſibility of landing. A landing
however was at laſt effected; and the
ſailors, after much ſearch, diſcovered a
kind of path way cut in the rock, which
they all aſcended in ſafety.</p>
            <p>The dawn now faintly glimmered,
and they ſurveyed the coaſt, but could
diſcover no human habitation. They ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
they were on the ſhores of Sicily,
but poſſeſſed no means of confirming
this conjecture. Terror, ſickneſs, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue
had ſubdued the ſtrength and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Julia, and ſhe was obliged to reſt
upon the rocks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0793800202:116"/>
The ſtorm now ſuddenly ſubſided,
and the total calm which ſucceeded to
the wild tumult of the winds and waves,
produced a ſtriking and ſublime effect.
The air was huſhed in a deathlike ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but the waves were yet violently
agitated; and by the encreaſing light,
parts of the wreck were ſeen floating wide
upon the face of the deep. Some ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
who had miſſed the boat were alſo
diſcovered clinging to pieces of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
and making towards the ſhore. On
obſerving this, their ſhipmates imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
deſcended to the boat; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off to ſea, reſcued them from their
perilous ſituation. When Julia was
ſomewhat re-animated, they proceeded
up the country in ſearch of a dwelling.</p>
            <p>They had travelled near half a league,
when the ſavage features of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
began to ſoften, and gradually
changed to the pictureſque beauty of
Sicilian ſcenery. They now diſcovered
at ſome diſtance a villa, ſeated on a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0793800202:117"/>
eminence crowned with woods. It
was the firſt human habitation they had
ſeen ſince they embarked for Italy; and
Julia, who was almoſt ſinking with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue,
beheld it with delight. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and his men haſtened towards it to
make known their diſtreſs, while Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
and Julia ſlowly followed. They
obſerved the men enter the villa, one of
whom quickly returned to acquaint
them with the hoſpitable reception his
comrades had received.</p>
            <p>Julia with difficulty reached the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
at the door of which ſhe was met
by a young cavalier, whoſe pleaſing
and intelligent countenance immediately
intereſted her in his favour. He wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
the ſtrangers with a benevolent
politeneſs, that diſſolved at once every
uncomfortable feeling which their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had excited, and produced an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous
eaſy confidence. Through
a light and elegant hall, riſing into a
dome, ſupported by pillars of white
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0793800202:118"/>
marble, and adorned with buſts; he led
them to a magnificent veſtibule, which
opened upon a lawn. Having ſeated
them at a table ſpread with refreſhments;
he left them, and they ſurveyed with
ſurprize, the beauty of the adjacent
ſcene.</p>
            <p>The lawn, which was on each ſide
bounded by hanging woods, deſcended
in gentle declivity to a fine lake, whoſe
ſmooth ſurface reflected the ſurrounding
ſhades. Beyond appeared the diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
riſing on the left into bold romantic
mountains, and on the right, exhibiting
a ſoft and glowing landſcape, whoſe
tranquil beauty formed a ſtriking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt
to the wild ſublimity of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
craggy heights. The blue and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
ocean terminated the view.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time the cavalier returned,
conducting two ladies of a very engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appearance, whom he preſented as
his wife and ſiſter. They welcomed
Julia with graceful kindneſs; but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0793800202:119"/>
ſoon obliged her to retire to reſt,
and a conſequent indiſpoſition encreaſed
ſo rapidly, as to render it impracticable
for her to quit her preſent abode on that
day. The captain and his men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
on their way, leaving Ferdinand
and Julia at the villa, where ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
every kind and tender affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The day which was to have devoted
Julia to a cloiſter, was uſhered in at
the abbey with the uſual ceremonies.
The church was ornamented, and all the
inhabitants of the monaſtery prepared to
attend. The <hi>Padre Abate</hi> now exulted in
the ſucceſs of his ſcheme, and anticipated
in imagination, the rage and vexation
of the marquis, when he ſhould diſcover
that his daughter was loſt to him for
ever.</p>
            <p>The hour of celebration arrived, and
he entered the church with a proud
firm ſtep, and with a countenance
which depictured his inward triumph;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0793800202:120"/>
he was proceeding to the high altar,
when he was told that Julia was no
where to be found. Aſtoniſhment for
a while ſuſpended other emotions,—he
yet believed it impoſſible that ſhe could
have effected an eſcape, and ordered
every part of the abbey to be ſearched—not
forgetting the ſecret caverns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the monaſtery, which wound
beneath the woods. When the ſearch
was over, and he became convinced ſhe
was fled; the deep workings of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
paſſions fermented into rage
which exceeded all bounds. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the moſt terrible judgments
upon Julia; and calling for Madame de
Menon, charged her with having inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her holy religion, in being acceſſary
to the flight of Julia. Madame endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
theſe reproaches with calm dignity,
and preſerved a ſteady ſilence; but ſhe
ſecretly determined to leave the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and ſeek in another, the repoſe
which ſhe could never hope to find in
this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0793800202:121"/>
The report of Julia's diſappearance
ſpread rapidly beyond the walls, and
ſoon reached the ears of the marquis,
who rejoiced in the circumſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that ſhe muſt now inevitably
fall into his hands.</p>
            <p>After his people, in obedience to his
orders, had carefully ſearched the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
woods and rocks, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
them from the abbey; and having
diſperſed them various ways in ſearch
of Julia, he returned to the caſtle of
Mazzini. Here new vexation awaited
him, for he now firſt learned that Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand
had eſcaped from confinement.</p>
            <p>The myſtery of Julia's flight was now
diſſolved; for it was evident by whoſe
means ſhe had effected it, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
iſſued orders to his people to ſecure
Ferdinand wherever he ſhould be found.</p>

            <p>HIPPOLITUS, who had languiſhed
under a long and dangerous ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
produced by his wounds, but
heightened and prolonged by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
of his mind, was detained in a ſmall
town on the coaſt of Calabria, and was
yet ignorant of the death of Cornelia.
He ſcarcely doubted that Julia was now
devoted to the duke, and this thought
was at times poiſon to his heart. After
his arrival in Calabria, immediately on
the recovery of his ſenſes, he diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a ſervant back to the caſtle of Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zini,
to gain ſecret intelligence of what
had paſſed after his departure. The
eagerneſs with which we endeavour to
eſcape from miſery, taught him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
a remote and romantic hope,
that Julia yet lived for him. Yet even

as the time elapſed which ſhould

By him he learned the news of
Julia's flight, and his heart dilated with
joy; but it was ſuddenly checked, when
he heard the marquis had diſcovered
her retreat in the abbey of St. Auguſtin.
The wounds which ſtill detained him in
confinement now became intolerable.
Julia might yet be loſt to him for
ever. But even his preſent ſtate of
fear and uncertainty was bliſs compared
with the anguiſh of deſpair, which his
mind had long endured.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was ſufficiently recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he quitted Italy for Sicily, in the
deſign of viſiting the monaſtery of St.
Auguſtin, where it was poſſible Julia
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0793800202:124"/>
might yet remain. That he might paſs
with the ſecrecy neceſſary to his plan,
and eſcape the attacks of the marquis,
he left his ſervants in Calabria and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
alone.</p>
            <p>It was morning when he landed at a
ſmall port of Sicily, and proceeded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the abbey of St. Auguſtin. As he
travelled, his imagination revolved the
ſcenes of his early love, the diſtreſs of
Julia, and the ſufferings of Ferdinand,
and his heart melted at the retroſpect.
He conſidered the probabilities of Julia's
having found protection from her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the pity of the <hi>Padre Abate;</hi> and
even ventured to indulge himſelf in a
flattering, fond anticipation of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when Julia ſhould again be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored
to his ſight.</p>
            <p>He arrived at the monaſtery, and his
grief may eaſily be imagined, when he
was informed of the death of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
ſiſter, and of the ſlight of Julia.
He quitted St. Auguſtin's immediately,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0793800202:125"/>
without even knowing that Madame de
Menon was there, and ſat out for a town
at ſome leagues diſtance, where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to paſs the night.</p>
            <p>Abſorbed in the melancholy reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which the late intelligence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
he gave the reins to his horſe,
and journeyed on unmindful of his
way. The evening was far advanced,
when he diſcovered that he had taken
a wrong direction, and that he was
bewildered in a wild and ſolitary ſcene.
He had wandered too far from the
road to hope to regain it, and he had
beſide no recollection of the objects
left behind him. A choice of errors
only, lay before him. The view on his
right hand exhibited high and ſavage
mountains, covered with heath and
black fir; and the wild deſolation of
their aſpect, together with the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
appearance of the path that wound
up their ſides, and which was the only
apparent track they afforded, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Hippolitus not to attempt their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0793800202:126"/>
On his left lay a foreſt, to which
the path he was then in led; its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
was gloomy, but he preferred it to
the mountains; and ſince he was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of its extent, there was a poſſibility
that he might paſs it, and reach a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
before the night was ſet in.—At
the worſt, the foreſt would afford him a
ſhelter from the winds; and however he
might be bewildered in its labyrinths, he
could aſcend a tree, and reſt in ſecurity
till the return of light ſhould afford him
an opportunity of extricating himſelf.
Among the mountains there was no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of meeting with other ſhelter
than what the habitation of man afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſuch a ſhelter there was little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of finding. Innumerable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
alſo threatened him here, from which
he would be ſecure on level ground.</p>
            <p>Having determined which way to
purſue, he puſhed his horſe into a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,
and entered the foreſt as the laſt
rays of the ſun trembled on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0793800202:127"/>
The thick foliage of the trees
threw a gloom around, which was every
moment deepened by the ſhades of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The path was uninterrupted, and
the count continued to purſue it till all
diſtinction was confounded in the veil
of night. Total darkneſs now made it
impoſſible for him to purſue his way.
He diſmounted, and faſtening his horſe
to a tree, climbed among the branches,
purpoſing to remain there till morning.</p>
            <p>He had not been long in this ſituation,
when a confuſed ſound of voices from
a diſtance rouſed his attention. The
ſound returned at intervals for ſome
time, but without ſeeming to approach.
He deſcended from the tree, that he
might the better judge of the direction
whence it came; but before he reached
the ground, the noiſe was ceaſed, and
all was profoundly ſilent. He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to liſten, but the ſilence remaining
undiſturbed, he began to think he had
been deceived by the ſinging of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0793800202:128"/>
wind among the leaves; and was prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to re-aſcend, when he perceived a
faint light glimmer through the foliage
from afar. The ſight revived a hope
that he was near ſome place of human
habitation; he therefore unfaſtened his
horſe, and led him towards the ſpot
whence the ray iſſued. The moon was
now riſen, and threw a checkered gleam
over his path ſufficient to direct him.</p>
            <p>Before he had proceeded far the light
diſappeared. He continued however his
way as nearly as he could gueſs, towards
the place whence it had iſſued; and after
much toil, found himſelf in a ſpot where
the trees formed a circle round a kind
of rude lawn. The moonlight diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him an edifice which appeared to
have been formerly a monaſtery, but
which now exhibited a pile of ruins,
whoſe grandeur, heightened by decay,
touched the beholder with reverential
awe. Hippolitus pauſed to gaze upon
the ſcene; the ſacred ſtillneſs of night
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0793800202:129"/>
encreaſed its effect, and a ſecret dread,
he knew not wherefore, ſtole upon his
heart.</p>
            <p>The ſilence and the character of the
place made him doubt whether this was
the ſpot he had been ſeeking; and as he
ſtood heſitating whether to proceed or
to return, he obſerved a figure ſtanding
under an arch-way of the ruin; it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a light in its hand, and paſſing
ſilently along, diſappeared in a remote
part of the building. The courage of
Hippolitus for a moment deſerted him.
An invincible curioſity, however, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
his terror, and he determined to
purſue, if poſſible, the way the figure
had taken.</p>
            <p>He paſſed over looſe ſtones through
a ſort of court, till he came to the
arch-way; here he ſtopped, for fear
returned upon him. Reſuming his
courage, however, he went on, ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to follow the way the figure
had paſſed, and ſuddenly found himſelf
in an encloſed part of the ruin, whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0793800202:130"/>
was more wild and deſolate than
any he had yet ſeen. Seized with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable
apprehenſion, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring,
when the low voice of a diſtreſſed
perſon ſtruck his ear. His heart ſunk
at the ſound, his limbs trembled, and he
was utterly unable to move.</p>
            <p>The ſound which appeared to be the
laſt groan of a dying perſon, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.
Hippolitus made a ſtrong ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and ſprang forward, when a light
burſt upon him from a ſhattered caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the building, and at the ſame
inſtant he heard the voices of men!</p>
            <p>He advanced ſoftly to the window,
and beheld in a ſmall room, which was
leſs decayed than the reſt of the edifice,
a group of men, who from the ſavage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their looks, and from their dreſs,
appeared to be banditti. They ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a man who lay on the ground wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and bathed in blood, and who it
was very evident had uttered the groans
heard by the count.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0793800202:131"/>
The obſcurity of the place prevented
Hippolitus from diſtinguiſhing the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the dying man. From the
blood which covered him, and from the
ſurrounding circumſtances, he appeared
to be murdered; and the count had no
doubt that the men he beheld were the
murderers. The horror of the ſcene
entirely overcame him; he ſtood rooted
to the ſpot, and ſaw the aſſaſſins rifle the
pockets of the dying perſon, who in a
voice ſcarcely articulate, but which deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
ſeemed to aid, ſupplicated for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
The ruffians anſwered him only
with execrations, and continued their
plunder. His groans and his ſufferings
ſerved only to aggravate their cruelty.
They were proceeding to take from him
a miniature picture, which was faſtened
round his neck, and had been hitherto
concealed in his boſom; when by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
effort he half raiſed himſelf from
the ground, and attempted to ſave it
from their hands. The effort availed
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0793800202:132"/>
him nothing; a blow from one of the
villians laid the unfortunate man on the
floor without motion. The horrid bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
of the act ſeized the mind of
Hippolitus ſo entirely, that forgetful of
his own ſituation, he groaned aloud,
and ſtarted with an inſtantaneous deſign
of avenging the deed. The noiſe he
made alarmed the banditti, who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whence it came, diſcovered the
count through the caſement. They
inſtantly quitted their prize, and ruſhed
towards the door of the room. He was
now returned to a ſenſe of his danger,
and endeavoured to eſcape to the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
part of the ruin; but terror bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
his ſenſes, and he miſtook his
way. Inſtead of regaining the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
he perplexed himſelf with fruitleſs
wanderings, and at length found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
only more deeply involved in the
ſecret receſſes of the pile.</p>
            <p>The ſteps of his purſuers gained faſt
upon him, and he continued to perplex
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0793800202:133"/>
himſelf with vain efforts at eſcape, till
at length, quite exhauſted, he ſunk on
the ground, and endeavoured to reſign
himſelf to his fate. He liſtened with a
kind of ſtern deſpair, and was ſurprized
to find all ſilent. On looking round,
he perceived by a ray of moon-light
which ſtreamed through a part of the
ruin from above, that he was in a ſort
of vault, which, from the ſmall means
he had of judging, he thought was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation he remained for a
conſiderable time, ruminating on the
means of eſcape, yet ſcarcely believing
eſcape was poſſible. If he continued
in the vault, he might continue there
only to be butchered; but by attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to reſcue himſelf from the place he
was now in, he muſt ruſh into the hands
of the banditti. Judging it, therefore,
the ſafer way of the two to remain where
he was, he endeavoured to await his fate
with fortitude, when ſuddenly the loud
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0793800202:134"/>
voices of the murderers burſt upon his
ear, and he heard ſteps advancing
quickly towards the ſpot where he lay.</p>
            <p>Deſpair inſtantly renewed his vigour;
he ſtarted from the ground, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
round him a look of eager deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
his eye caught the glimpſe of a
ſmall door, upon which the moon-beam
now fell. He made towards it, and
paſſed it juſt as the light of a torch
gleamed upon the walls of the vault.</p>
            <p>He groped his way along a winding
paſſage, and at length came to a flight
of ſteps. Notwithſtanding the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
he reached the bottom in ſafety.</p>
            <p>He now for the firſt time ſtopped to
liſten—the ſounds of purſuit were ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all was ſilent! Continuing to
wander on in ineffectual endeavours to
eſcape, his hands at length touched cold
iron, and he quickly perceived it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to a door. The door however
was faſtened, and reſiſted all his efforts
to open it. He was giving up the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0793800202:135"/>
in deſpair, when a loud ſcream
from within, followed by a dead and
heavy noiſe, rouſed all his attention.
Silence enſued. He liſtened for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
time at the door, his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
filled with images of horror, and
expecting to hear the ſound repeated.
He ſought for a decayed part of the
door, through which he might diſcover
what was beyond; but he could find
none; and after waiting ſome time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hearing any farther noiſe, he was
quitting the ſpot, when in paſſing his
arm over the door, it ſtruck againſt
ſomething hard. On examination he
perceived to his extreme ſurprize that
the key was in the lock. For a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he heſitated what to do; but curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
overcame other conſiderations, and
with a trembling hand he turned the
key. The door opened into a large and
deſolate apartment, dimly lighted by a
lamp that ſtood on a table, which
was almoſt the only furniture of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0793800202:136"/>
place. The count had advanced ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſteps before he perceived an object,
which fixed all his attention. This
was the figure of a young woman lying
on the floor apparently dead. Her face
was concealed in her robe; and the long
auburn treſſes which fell in beautiful
luxuriance over her boſom, ſerved to
veil a part of the glowing beauty which
the diſorder of her dreſs would have
revealed.</p>
            <p>Pity, ſurprize, and admiration ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
in the breaſt of Hippolitus; and
while he ſtood ſurveying the object
which excited theſe different emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he heard a ſtep advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the room. He flew to the door
by which he had entered, and was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
enough to reach it before the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the perſons whoſe ſteps he
heard. Having turned the key, he
ſtopped at the door to liſten to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
He diſtinguiſhed the voices
of two men, and knew them to be
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0793800202:137"/>
thoſe of the aſſaſſins. Preſently he
heard a piercing ſhriek, and at the ſame
inſtant the voices of the ruffians grew
loud and violent. One of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
that the lady was dying, and
accuſed the other of having frightened
her to death, ſwearing with horrid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations
that ſhe was his, and he would
defend her to the laſt drop of his blood.
The diſpute grew higher; and neither
of the ruffians would give up his claim
to the unfortunate object of their alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>The claſhing of ſwords was ſoon after
heard, together with a violent noiſe.
The ſcreams were repeated, and the
oaths and execrations of the diſputants
redoubled. They ſeemed to move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the door, behind which Hippolitus
was concealed; ſuddenly the door was
ſhook with great force, a deep groan fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and was inſtantly ſucceeded by a
noiſe like that of a perſon whoſe whole
weight falls at once to the ground.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0793800202:138"/>
For a moment all was ſilent. Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
had no doubt that one of the ruffians
had deſtroyed the other, and was ſoon
confirmed in the belief—for the ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
triumphed with brutal exultation
over his fallen antagoniſt. The ruffian
haſtily quitted the room, and Hippolitus
ſoon after heard the diſtant voices of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
perſons in loud diſpute. The ſounds
ſeemed to come from a chamber over
the place where he ſtood; he alſo heard
a trampling of feet from above, and
could even diſtinguiſh, at intervals, the
words of the diſputants. From theſe
he gathered enough to learn that the
affray which had juſt happened, and the
lady who had been the occaſion of it,
were the ſubjects of diſcourſe. The
voices frequently roſe together, and
confounded all diſtinction.</p>
            <p>At length the tumult began to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and Hippolitus could diſtinguiſh
what was ſaid. The ruffians agreed to
give up the lady in queſtion to him who
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0793800202:139"/>
had fought for her; and leaving him to
his prize, they all went out in queſt of
farther prey. The ſituation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
lady excited a mixture of pity
and indignation in Hippolitus, which
for ſome time entirely occupied him;
he revolved the means of extricating
her from ſo deplorable a ſituation, and
in theſe thoughts almoſt forgot his own
danger. He now heard her ſighs; and
while his heart melted to the ſounds, the
farther door of the apartment was thrown
open, and the wretch to whom ſhe had
been allotted, ruſhed in. Her ſcreams
now redoubled, but they were of no
avail with the ruffian who had ſeized
her in his arms; when the count, who
was unarmed, inſenſible to every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
but that of a generous pity, burſt
into the room, but became fixed like a
ſtatue when he beheld his Julia ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
in the graſp of the ruffian. On
diſcovering Hippolitus, ſhe made a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſpring, and liberated herſelf; when,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0793800202:140"/>
running to him, ſhe ſunk lifeleſs in his
arms.</p>
            <p>Surprize and fury ſparkled in the eyes
of the ruffian, and he turned with a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
deſperation upon the count; who,
relinquiſhing Julia, ſnatched up the
ſword of the dead ruffian, which lay
upon the floor, and defended himſelf.
The combat was furious, but Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
laid his antagoniſt ſenſelſs at his
feet. He flew to Julia, who now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
but who for ſome time could
ſpeak only by her tears. The tranſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of various and rapid ſenſations,
which her heart experienced, and the
ſtrangely mingled emotions of joy and
terror that agitated Hippolitus, can only
be underſtood by experience. He raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her from the floor, and endeavoured
to ſoothe her to compoſure, when ſhe
called wildly upon Ferdinand. At his
name the count ſtarted, and inſtantly
remembered the dying cavalier, whoſe
countenance the glooms had concealed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0793800202:141"/>
from his view. His heart thrilled with
ſecret agony, yet he reſolved to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his terrible conjectures from Julia,
of whom he learned that Ferdinand,
with herſelf, had been taken by banditti
in the way from the villa which had
offered them ſo hoſpitable a reception
after the ſhip-wreck. They were on
the road to a port whence they deſigned
again to embark for Italy, when this
misfortune overtook them. Julia add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Ferdinand had been immediately
ſeparated from her; and that, for ſome
hours, ſhe had been confined in the
apartment where Hippolitus found her.</p>
            <p>The count with difficulty concealed
his terrible apprehenſions for Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,
and vainly ſtrove to ſoften Julia's
diſtreſs. But there was no time to be
loſt—they had yet to find a way out
of the edifice, and before they could
accompliſh this, the banditti might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
It was alſo poſſible that ſome of
the party were left to watch this their
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0793800202:142"/>
abode during the abſence of the reſt,
and this was another circumſtance of
reaſonable alarm.</p>
            <p>After ſome little conſideration, Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus
judged it moſt prudent to ſeek
an outlet through the paſſage by which
he entered; he therefore took the lamp,
and led Julia to the door. They enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the avenue, and locking the door
after them, ſought the flight of ſteps
down which the count had before
paſſed; but having purſued the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the avenue a conſiderable time
without finding them, he became cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
he had miſtaken the way. They,
however, found another flight, which
they deſcended, and entered upon a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
ſo very narrow and low, as not to
admit of a perſon walking upright.
This paſſage was cloſed by a door,
which on examination was found to be
chiefly of iron. Hippolitus was ſtartled
at the ſight, but on applying his ſtrength
found it gradually yield, when the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0793800202:143"/>
air ruſhed out, and had nearly
extinguiſhed the light. They now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
upon a dark abyſs; and the door
which moved upon a ſpring, ſuddenly
cloſed upon them. On looking around
they beheld a large vault; and it is not
eaſy to imagine their horror on diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they were in a receptacle for the
murdered bodies of the unfortunate
people who had fallen into the hands of
the banditti.</p>
            <p>The count could ſcarcely ſupport the
fainting ſpirits of Julia; he ran to the
door which he endeavoured to open, but
the lock was ſo conſtructed that it could
be moved only on the other ſide, and
all his efforts were uſeleſs. He was
conſtrained, therefore, to ſeek for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
door, but could find none. Their
ſituation was the moſt deplorable that
can be imagined; for they were now
incloſed in a vault ſtrewn with the dead
bodies of the murdered, and muſt there
become the victims of famine, or of the
ſword. The earth was in ſeveral places
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0793800202:144"/>
thrown up, and marked the boundaries
of new made graves. The bodies which
remained unburied were probably left
either from hurry or negligence, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
a ſpectacle too ſhocking for
humanity. The ſufferings of Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus
were increaſed by thoſe of Julia,
who was ſinking with horror, and who
he endeavoured to ſupport to a part of
the vault which fell into a receſs—where
ſtood a bench.</p>
            <p>They had not been long in this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when they heard a noiſe which
approached gradually, and which did
not appear to come from the avenue
they had paſſed.</p>
            <p>The noiſe increaſed, and they could
diſtinguiſh voices. Hippolitus believed
the murderers were returned; that they
had traced his retreat, and were coming
towards the vault by ſome way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to him. He prepared for the
worſt—and drawing his ſword, reſolved
to defend Julia to the laſt. Their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0793800202:145"/>
however, was ſoon diſſipated
by a trampling of horſes, which ſound
had occaſioned his alarm, and which
now ſeemed to come from a court-yard
above, extremely near the vault. He
diſtinctly heard the voices of the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti,
together with the moans and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
of ſome perſon, whom it was
evident they were about to plunder.
The ſound appeared ſo very near, that
Hippolitus was both ſhocked and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized;
and looking round the vault,
he perceived a ſmall grated window
placed very high in the wall, which he
concluded overlooked the place where
the robbers were aſſembled. He recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
that his light might betray him;
and horrible as was the alternative,
he was compelled to extinguiſh it. He
now attempted to climb to the grate,
through which he might obtain a view
of what was paſſing without. This at
length he effected, for the ruggedneſs of
the wall afforded him a footing. He
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0793800202:146"/>
beheld in a ruinous court, which was
partially illuminated by the glare of
torches, a group of banditti ſurrounding
two perſons who were bound on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
and who were ſupplicating for
mercy.</p>
            <p>One of the robbers exclaiming with
an oath that this was a golden night,
bade his comrades diſpatch, adding he
would go to find Paulo and the lady.</p>
            <p>The effect which the latter part of
this ſentence had upon the priſoners in
the vault, may be more eaſily imagined
than deſcribed. They were now in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
darkneſs in this manſion of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
without means of eſcape, and in
momentary expectation of ſharing a fate
ſimilar to that of the wretched objects
around them. Julia overcome with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
and terror, ſunk on the ground;
and Hippolitus, deſcending from the
grate, became inſenſible of his own
danger in his apprehenſion for her.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time all without was confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0793800202:147"/>
and uproar; the ruffian who had
left the court returned with the alarm
that the lady was fled, and that Paulo
was murdered. The robbers quitting
their booty to go in ſearch of the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
and to diſcover the murderer,
dreadful vociferations reſounded through
every receſs of the pile.</p>
            <p>The tumult had continued a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
time, which the priſoners had
paſſed in a ſtate of horrible ſuſpence,
when they heard the uproar advancing
towards the vault, and ſoon after a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of voices ſhouted down the avenue.
The ſound of ſteps quickened. Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus
again drew his ſword, and placed
himſelf oppoſite the entrance, where he
had not ſtood along, when a violent
puſh was made againſt the door; it
flew open, and a party of men ruſhed
into the vault.</p>
            <p>Hippolitus kept his poſition, proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he would deſtroy the firſt who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached.
At the ſound of his voice
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0793800202:148"/>
they ſtopped; but preſently advancing,
commanded him in the king's name to
ſurrender. He now diſcovered what
his agitation had prevented him from
obſerving ſooner, that the men before
him were not banditti, but the officers
of juſtice. They had received informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this haunt of villainy from the
ſon of a Sicilian nobleman, who had
fallen into the hands of this banditti,
and had afterwards eſcaped from their
power.</p>
            <p>The officers came attended by a
guard, and were every way prepared to
proſecute a ſtrenuous ſearch through
theſe horrible receſſes.</p>
            <p>Hippolitus enquired for Ferdinand,
and they all quitted the vault in ſearch
of him. In the court, to which they
now aſcended, the greater part of the
banditti were ſecured by a number of
the guard. The count accuſed the
robbers of having ſecreted his friend,
whom he deſcribed, and demanded to
have liberated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0793800202:149"/>
With one voice they denied the fact,
and were reſolute in perſiſting that they
knew nothing of the perſon deſcribed.
This denial confirmed Hippolitus in
his former terrible ſurmiſe; that the
dying cavalier whom he had ſeen, was
no other than Ferdinand, and he became
furious. He bade the officers proſecute
their ſearch, who, leaving a guard over
the banditti they had ſecured, followed
him to the room where the late dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſcene had been acted.</p>
            <p>The room was dark and empty, but
the traces of blood were viſible on the
floor; and Julia, though ignorant of the
particular apprehenſion of Hippolitus,
almoſt ſwooned at the ſight. On quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the room, they wandered for ſome
time among the ruins, without diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing extraordinary, till, in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
under the arch-way by which Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus
had firſt entered the ruins, their
footſteps returned a deep ſound, which
convinced them that the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0793800202:150"/>
was hollow. On cloſe examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they perceived by the light of their
torch, a trap door, which with ſome
difficulty they lifted, and diſcovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
a narrow flight of ſteps. They all
deſcended into a low winding paſſage,
where they had not been long, above,
when they heard a trampling of horſes
and a loud and ſudden uproar.</p>
            <p>The officers apprehending that the
banditti had overcome the guard, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
back to the trap-door, which they
had ſcarcely lifted, when they heard a
claſhing of ſwords, and a confuſion of
unknown voices. Looking onward,
they beheld through the arch, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſort of court, a large party of ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti
who were juſt arrived, reſcuing
their comrades, and contending furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
with the guard.</p>
            <p>On obſerving this, ſeveral of the
officers ſprang forward to the aſſiſtance
of their friends; and the reſt, ſubdued
by cowardice, hurried down the ſteps,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0793800202:151"/>
letting the trap-door fall after them
with a thundering noiſe. They gave
notice to Hippolitus of what was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
above, who hurried Julia along the
paſſage in ſearch of ſome outlet or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment.
They could find neither;
and had not long purſued the windings
of the way, when they heard the trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door
lifted, and the ſteps of perſons
deſcending. Deſpair gave ſtrength to
Julia, and winged her flight. But they
were now ſtopped by a door which
cloſed the paſſage, and the ſound of
diſtant voices murmured along the walls.</p>
            <p>The door was faſtened by ſtrong iron
bolts, which Hippolitus vainly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to draw. The voices drew near.
After much labour and difficulty the bolts
yielded—the door uncloſed—and light
dawned upon them through the mouth
of a cave, into which they now entered.
On quitting the cave they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the foreſt, and in a ſhort time
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0793800202:152"/>
reached the borders. They now ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to ſtop, and looking back per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no perſon in purſuit.</p>

            <p>WHEN Julia had reſted, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the track before them,
and in a ſhort time arrived at a village
where they obtained ſecurity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment.</p>
            <p>But Julia, whoſe mind was occupied
with dreadful anxiety concerning Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,
became indifferent to all around
her. Even the preſence of Hippolitus,
which but lately would have raiſed her
from miſery to joy, failed to ſoothe her
diſtreſs. The ſteady and noble attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her brother had ſunk deep in
her heart, and reflection only aggravat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her affliction. Yet the banditti had
ſteadily perſiſted in affirming that he
was not concealed in their receſſes; and
this circumſtance, which threw a deeper
ſhade over the fears of Hippolitus, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
a glimmering of hope to the
mind of Julia.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0793800202:154"/>
A more immediate intereſt at length
forced her mind from this ſorrowful
ſubject. It was neceſſary to determine
upon ſome line of conduct, for ſhe was
now in an unknown ſpot, and ignorant
of any place of refuge. The count,
who trembled at the dangers which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed
her, and at the probabilities he
ſaw of her being torn from him for ever,
ſuffered a conſideration of them to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the dangerous delicacy which at
this mournful period required his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
He entreated her to deſtroy the
poſſibility of ſeparation, by conſenting
to become his immediately. He urged
that a prieſt could be eaſily procured
from a neighbouring convent, who would
confirm the bonds which had ſo long
united their hearts, and who would
thus at once arreſt the deſtiny that ſo
long had threatened his hopes.</p>
            <p>This propoſal, though ſimilar to the
one ſhe had before accepted; and though
the certain means of reſcuing her from
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0793800202:155"/>
the fate ſhe dreaded, ſhe now turned
from in ſorrow and dejection. She
loved Hippolitus with a ſteady and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
affection, which was ſtill heightened
by the gratitude he claimed as her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer;
but ſhe conſidered it a propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the memory of that brother
who had ſuffered ſo much for her ſake,
to mingle joy with the grief which her
uncertainty concerning him occaſioned.
She ſoftened her refuſal with a tender
grace, that quickly diſſipated the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
doubt ariſing in the mind of Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus,
and encreaſed his fond admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her character.</p>
            <p>She deſired to retire for a time to
ſome obſcure convent, there to await
the iſſue of the event, which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
involved her in perplexity and
ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Hippolitus ſtruggled with his feelings
and forbore to preſs farther the ſuit on
which his happineſs, and almoſt his
exiſtence now depended. He enquired
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0793800202:156"/>
at the village for a neighbouring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
and was told that there was none
within twelve leagues, but that near
the town of Palini, at about that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
were two. He procured horſes;
and leaving the officers to return to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo
for a ſtronger guard, he, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by Julia, entered on the road to
Palini.</p>
            <p>Julia was ſilent and thoughtful; Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus
gradually ſunk into the ſame
mood, and he often caſt a cautious look
around as they travelled for ſome hours
along the foot of the mountains. They
ſtopped to dine under the ſhade of
ſome beech trees; for, fearful of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
Hippolitus had provided againſt
the neceſſity of entering many inns.
Having finiſhed their repaſt, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
their journey; but Hippolitus now
began to doubt whether he was in the
right direction. Being deſtitute, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
of the means of certainty upon
this point, he followed the road before
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0793800202:157"/>
him, which now wound up the ſide of
a ſteep hill, whence they deſcended into
a rich valley, where the ſhepherd's pipe
ſounded ſweetly from afar among the
hills. The evening ſun ſhed a mild
and mellow luſtre over the landſcape,
and ſoftened each feature with a vermil
glow that would have inſpired a mind
leſs occupied than Julia's, with ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of congenial tranquillity.</p>
            <p>The evening now cloſed in; and as
they were doubtful of the road, and
found it would be impoſſible to reach
Palini that night, they took the way to
a village, which they perceived at the
extremity of the valley.</p>
            <p>They had proceeded about half a
mile, when they heard a ſudden ſhout
of voices echoed from among the hills
behind them; and looking back per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
faintly through the duſk a party
of men on horſeback making towards
them. As they drew nearer, the words
they ſpoke were diſtinguiſhable, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0793800202:158"/>
Julia heard her own name ſounded.
Shocked at this circumſtance, ſhe had
now no doubt that ſhe was diſcovered
by a party of her father's people, and
ſhe fled with Hippolitus along the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.
The purſuers, however, were
almoſt come up with them, when they
reached the mouth of a cavern, into
which ſhe ran for concealment. Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus
drew his ſword; and awaiting
his enemies, ſtood to defend the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
            <p>In a few moments Julia heard the
claſhing of ſwords. Her heart trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for Hippolitus; and ſhe was upon
the point of returning to reſign herſelf
at once to the power of her enemies,
and thus avert the danger that threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, when ſhe diſtinguiſhed the loud
voice of the duke.</p>
            <p>She ſhrunk involuntarily at the found,
and purſuing the windings of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
fled into its inmoſt receſfes. Here
ſhe had not been long when the voices
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0793800202:159"/>
ſounded through the cave, and drew
near. It was now evident that Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus
was conquered, and that her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were in ſearch of her. She threw
round a look of unutterable anguiſh, and
perceived very near, by a ſudden gleam
of torch-light a low and deep receſs
in the rock. The light, which belonged
to her purſuers, grew ſtronger; and ſhe
entered the rock on her knees, for the
overhanging crags would not ſuffer her
to paſs otherwiſe; and having gone a
few yards, perceived that it was termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by a door. The door yielded to
her touch, and ſhe ſuddenly found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a highly vaulted cavern, which
received a feeble light from the moon
beams that ſtreamed through an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the rock above.</p>
            <p>She cloſed the door, and pauſed to
liſten. The voices grewl ouder, and
more diſtinct, and at laſt approached ſo
near that ſhe diſtinguiſhed what was
ſaid. Above the reſt ſhe heard the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0793800202:160"/>
voice of the duke. "It is impoſſible
ſhe can have quitted the cavern," ſaid
he, "and I will not leave it till I have
found her. Seek to the left of that rock,
while I examine beyond this point."</p>
            <p>Theſe words were ſufficient for Julia;
ſhe fled from the door acroſs the cavern
before her, and having ran a conſiderable
way without coming to a termination,
ſtopped to breathe. All was now ſtill;
and as ſhe looked around, the gloomy
obſcurity of the place ſtruck upon her
fancy all its horrors. She imperfectly
ſurveyed the vaſtneſs of the cavern in
wild amazement, and feared that ſhe had
precipitated herſelf again into the power
of banditti, for whom alone this place
appeared a fit receptacle. Having liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
a long time without hearing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of voices, ſhe ſought to find the
door by which ſhe had entered, but the
gloom, and vaſt extent of the cavern,
made the endeavour hopeleſs, and the
attempt unſucceſsful. Having wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0793800202:161"/>
a conſiderable time through the void,
ſhe gave up the effort, endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
herſelf to her fate, and to compoſe her
diſtracted thoughts. The remembrance
of her former wonderful eſcape inſpired
her with confidence in the mercy of
God. But Hippolitus and Ferdinand
were now both loſt to her—loſt, perhaps
for ever—and the uncertainty of their
fate gave force to fancy, and poignancy
to ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Towards morning grief yielded to
nature, and Julia ſunk to repoſe. She
was awakened by the ſun, whoſe rays
darting, obliquely through the opening
in the rock, threw a partial light acroſs
the cavern. Her ſenſes were yet bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by ſleep, and ſhe ſtarted in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
on beholding her ſituation; as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection
gradually ſtole upon her mind,
her ſorrows returned, and ſhe ſickened
at the fatal retroſpect.</p>
            <p>She aroſe, and renewed her ſearch for
an outlet. The light, imperfect as it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0793800202:162"/>
was, now aſſiſted her, and ſhe found a
door, which ſhe perceived was not the
one by which ſhe had entered. It was
firmly faſtened; ſhe diſcovered, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the bolts and the lock that held
it, and at length uncloſed the door. It
opened upon a dark paſſage, which ſhe
entered.</p>
            <p>She groped along the winding walls
for ſome time, when ſhe perceived the
way was obſtructed. She now diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that a door interrupted her progreſs,
and ſought for the bolts which might
faſten it. Theſe ſhe found; and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
by deſperation forced them back.
The door opened, and ſhe beheld in a
ſmall room, which received its feeble
light from a window above, the pale
and emaciated figure of a woman, ſeated,
with half cloſed eyes, in a kind of elbow
chair. On perceiving Julia, ſhe ſtarted
from her ſeat, and her countenance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
a wild ſurprize. Her features,
which were worn by ſorrow, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0793800202:163"/>
the traces of beauty, and in her
air was a mild dignity that excited in
Julia an involuntary veneration.</p>
            <p>She ſeemed as if about to ſpeak, when
fixing her eyes earneſtly and ſteadily
upon Julia, ſhe ſtood for a moment in
eager gaze, and ſuddenly exclaiming,
"My daughter!" fainted away.</p>
            <p>The aſtoniſhment of Julia would
ſcarcely ſuffer her to aſſiſt the lady, who
lay ſenſeleſs on the floor. A multitude
of ſtrange imperfect ideas ruſhed upon
her mind, and ſhe was loſt in confuſion
and perplexity; but as ſhe examined the
features of the ſtranger, which were now
re-kindling into life, ſhe thought ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the reſembl<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ce of Emilia!</p>
            <p>The lady breathing a deep ſigh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
her eyes; ſhe raiſed them to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
who hung over her in ſpeechleſs
aſtoniſhment, and fixing them upon her
with a tender earneſt expreſſion—they
filled with tears. She preſſed Julia to
her heart, and a few moments of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0793800202:164"/>
unutterable emotion followed.
When the lady grew more compoſed,
"Thank heaven,!" ſaid ſhe, "my
prayer is granted. I am permitted to
embrace one of my children before I die.
Tell me what brought you hither. Has
the marquis at laſt relented, and allowed
me once more to behold you, or has his
death diſſolved my wretched bondage?"</p>
            <p>Truth now glimmered upon the mind
of Julia, but ſo faintly, that inſtead of
enlightening, it ſerved only to encreaſe
her perplexity.</p>
            <p>"Is the marquis Mazzini living?"
continued the lady. Theſe words were
not to be doubted; Julia threw herſelf
at the feet of her mother, and embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her knees in an energy of joy, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
only in ſobs.</p>
            <p>The marchioneſs eagerly enquired
after her children. "Emilia is living," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
Julia, "but my dear brother—"
"Tell me,"  cried the marchioneſs,
with quickneſs. An explanation enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0793800202:165"/>
When ſhe was informed concerning
Ferdinand, ſhe ſighed deeply, and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her eyes to heaven, endeavoured to
aſſume a look of pious reſignation; but
the ſtruggle of maternal feeling was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in her countenance, and almoſt
overcame her powers of reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Julia gave a ſhort account of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
adventures, and of her entrance
into the cavern; and found to her inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible
ſuprize, that ſhe was now in a
ſubterranean abode belonging to the
ſouthern buildings of the caſtle of Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zini!
The marchioneſs was beginning
her narrative, when a door was heard to
unlock above, and the ſound of a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep
followed.</p>
            <p>"Fly!" cried the marchioneſs, "ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
yourſelf if poſſible, for the marquis
is coming." Julia's heart ſunk at theſe
words; ſhe pauſed not a moment, but
retired through the door by which ſhe
had entered. This ſhe had ſcarcely
done, when another door of the cell
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0793800202:166"/>
was unlocked, and ſhe heard the voice
of her father. Its founds thrilled her
with univerſal tremour; the dread of
diſcovery ſo ſtrongly operated upon her
mind, that ſhe ſtood in momentary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of ſeeing the door of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
uncloſed by the marquis; and ſhe
was deprived of all power of ſeeking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
in the cavern.</p>
            <p>At length the marquis, who came
with food, quitted the cell, and re-lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the door, when Julia ſtole forth from
her hiding place. The marchioneſs
again embraced, and wept over her
daughter. The narrative of her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
upon which ſhe now entered, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
diſſipated the myſtery which had
ſo long enveloped the ſouthern build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the caſtle.</p>
            <p>"Oh! why," ſaid the marchioneſs,
"is it my taſk to diſcover to my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the vices of her father? In relating
my ſufferings, I reveal his crimes! It is
now about fifteen years, as near as I can
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0793800202:167"/>
gueſs from the ſmall means I have of
judging, ſince I entered this horrible
abode. My ſorrows, alas! began not
here; they commenced at an earlier pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.
But it is ſufficient to obſerve, that
the paſſion whence originated all my
misfortunes, was diſcovered by me long
before I experienced the more baleful
effect of its influence."</p>
            <p>"Seven years had elapſed ſince my
marriage, when the charms of Maria de
Vellorno, a young lady ſingularly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
inſpired the marquis with a paſſion
as violent as it was irregular. I obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with deep and ſilent anguiſh, the
cruel indifference of my lord towards
me, and the rapid progreſs of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for another. I ſeverely examined
my paſt conduct, which I am thankful
to ſay preſented a retroſpect of only
blameleſs actions; and I endeavoured by
meek ſubmiſſion, and tender aſſiduities,
to recall that affection which was, alas!
gone for ever. My meek ſubmiſſion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0793800202:168"/>
was conſidered as marks of a ſervile
and inſenſible mind; and my tender
aſſiduities, to which his heart no longer
reſponded, created only diſguſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
the proud ſpirit it was meant to
conciliate."</p>
            <p>"The ſecret grief which this change
occaſioned, conſumed my ſpirits, and
preyed upon my conſtitution, till at
length a ſevere illneſs threatened my
life. I beheld the approach of death
with a ſteady eye, and even welcomed
it as the paſs-port to tranquillity; but it
was deſtined that I ſhould linger through
new ſcenes of miſery."</p>
            <p>"One day, which it appears was the
paroxyſm of my diſorder, I ſunk into a
ſtate of total torpidity, in which I lay
for ſeveral hours. It is impoſſible to
deſcribe my feelings, when, on recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I found myſelf in this hedious
abode. For ſome time I doubted my
ſenſes, and afterwards believed that I
had quitted this world for another; but
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0793800202:169"/>
I was not long ſuffered to continue
in my error, the appearance of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
bringing me to a perfect ſenſe of
my ſituation."</p>
            <p>"I now underſtood that I had been
conveyed by his direction to this receſs
of horror, where it was his will I ſhould
remain. My prayers, my ſupplications
were ineffectual; the hardneſs of his
heart repelled my ſorrows back upon
myſelf; and as no entreaties could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon him to inform me where I
was, or of his reaſon for placing me
here, I remained for many years igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of my vicinity to the caſtle, and of
the motive for my confinement."</p>
            <p>"From that fatal day, until very
lately, I ſaw the marquis no more—but
was attended by a perſon who had been
for ſome years dependant upon his
bounty, and whom neceſſity, united to
an inſenſible heart, had doubtleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to accept this office. He gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
brought me a week's proviſions, at
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0793800202:170"/>
ſtated intervals, and I remarked that
his viſits were always in the night."</p>
            <p>"Contrary to my expectation, or
my wiſh, nature did that for me which
medicine had refuſed, and I recovered
as if to puniſh with diſappointment and
anxiety my cruel tyrant. I afterwards
learned, that in obedience to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's
order, I had been carried to this ſpot
by Vincent during the night, and that
I had been buried in effigy at a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
church, with all the pomp of
funeral honour due to my rank."</p>
            <p>At the name of Vincent, Julia ſtarted;
the doubtful words he had uttered on
his death bed were now explained—the
cloud of myſtery which had ſo long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
the ſouthern buildings broke at
once away; and each particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that had excited her former ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
aroſe to her view entirely unveiled
by the words of the marchioneſs.—The
long and total deſertion of this part of
the: fabric—the light that had appeared
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0793800202:171"/>
through the caſement—the figure ſhe
had ſeen iſſue from the tower—the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
noiſes ſhe had heard—were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
evidently dependant on the
impriſonment of the marchioneſs; the
latter of which incidents were produced
either by Vincent, or the marquis, in
their attendance upon her.</p>
            <p>When ſhe conſidered the long and
dreadful ſufferings of her mother, and
that ſhe had for many years lived ſo
near her ignorant of her miſery, and
even of her exiſtence—ſhe was loſt in
aſtoniſhment and pity.</p>
            <p>"My days," continued the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs,
"paſſed in a dead uniformity,
more dreadful than the moſt acute viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes
of misfortune, and which would
certainly have ſubdued my reaſon, had
not thoſe firm principles of religious
faith, which I imbibed in early youth,
enabled me to withſtand the ſtill, but
forceful, preſſure of my calamity."</p>
            <p>"The inſenſible heart of Vincent at
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0793800202:172"/>
length began to ſoften by my misfortunes.
He brought me ſeveral articles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
of which I had hitherto been def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute,
and anſwered ſome queſtions I
put to him concerning my family. To
releaſe me from my preſent ſituation,
however his inclination might befriend
me, was not to be expected, ſince his life
would have paid the forfeiture of what
would be termed his duty."</p>
            <p>"I now firſt diſcovered my vicinity
to the caſtle. I learned alſo, that the
marquis had married Maria de Vellorno,
with whom he reſided at Naples, but
that my daughters were left at Mazzini.
This laſt intelligence awakened in my
heart the throbs of warm maternal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
and on my knees I ſupplicated
to ſee them. So earneſtly I entreated,
and ſo ſolemnly I promiſed to return
quietly to my priſon, that at length,
prudence yielded to pity, and Vincent
conſented to my requeſt."</p>
            <p>"On the following day he came to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0793800202:173"/>
the cell, and informed me my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were going into the woods, and
that I might ſee them from a window
near which they would paſs. My nerves
thrilled at theſe words, and I could
ſcarcely ſupport myſelf to the ſpot I ſo
eagerly ſought. He led me through
long and intricate paſſages, as I gueſſed
by the frequent turnings, for my eyes
were bound, till I reached a hall of
the ſouth buildings. I followed to a
room above, where the full light of
day once more burſt upon my ſight, and
almoſt overpowered me. Vincent plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me by a window, which looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the woods. Oh! what moments
of painful impatience were thoſe in
which I awaited your arrival!"</p>
            <p>"At length you appeared. I ſaw
you—I ſaw my children—and was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
permitted to claſp them to my
heart, or to ſpeak to them! You was
leaning on the arm of your ſiſter, and
your countenances ſpoke the ſprightly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0793800202:174"/>
happy innocence of youth—Alas! you
knew not the wretched fate of your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who then gazed upon you! Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
you were at too great a diſtance
for my weak voice to reach you, with
the utmoſt difficulty I avoided throwing
open the window, and endeavouring to
diſcover myſelf. The remembrance of
my ſolemn promiſe, and that the life of
Vincent would be ſacrificed by the act,
alone reſtrained me. I ſtruggled for
ſome time with emotions too powerful
for my nature, and fainted away."</p>
            <p>"On recovering I called wildly for
my children, and went to the window—but
you were gone! Not all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
of Vincent could for ſome time
remove me from this ſtation, where I
waited in the fond expectation of ſeeing
you again—but you appeared no more!
At laſt I returned to my cell in an extaſy
of grief which I tremble even to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber."</p>
            <p>"This interview, ſo eagerly ſought,
and ſo reluctantly granted, proved a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0793800202:175"/>
ſource of new miſery—inſtead of
calming, it agitated my mind with a
reſtleſs wild deſpair, which bore away
my ſtrongeſt powers of reſiſtance. I
raved inceſſantly of my children, and
inceſſantly ſolicited to ſee them again—Vincent,
however, had found but too
much cauſe to repent of his firſt indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
to grant me a ſecond."</p>
            <p>"About this time a circumſtance
occurred which promiſed me a ſpeedy
releaſe from calamity. Above a week
elapſed, and Vincent did not appear.
My little ſtock of proviſion was exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and I had been two days without
food, when I again heard the doors that
led to my priſon crack on their hinges.
An unknown ſtep approached, and in a
few minutes the marquis entered my
cell! My blood was chilled at the ſight,
and I cloſed my eyes as I hoped for the
laſt time. The ſound of his voice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
me. His countenance was dark
and ſullen, and I perceived that he
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0793800202:176"/>
trembled. He informed me that Vincent
was no more, and that henceforward his
office he ſhould take upon himſelf. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
to reproach—where reproach would
only have produced new ſufferings, and
with-held ſupplication where it would
have exaſperated conſcience and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
revenge. My knowledge of
the marquis's ſecond marriage I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed."</p>
            <p>"He uſually attended me when
night might beſt conceal his viſits;
though theſe were irregular in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
Lately, from what motive I can
not gueſs, he has ceaſed his nocturnal
viſits, and comes only in the day."</p>
            <p>"Once when midnight encreaſed the
darkneſs of my priſon, and ſeemed to
render ſilence even more awful, touched
by the ſacred horrors of the hour, I
poured forth my diſtreſs in loud lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Oh! never can I forget what I
felt, when I heard a diſtant voice anſwer
to my moan! A wild ſuprize, which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0793800202:177"/>
was ſtrangely mingled with hope, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, and in my firſt emotion I ſhould
have anſwered the call, had not a recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
croſſed me, which blaſted at once
every half-raiſed ſenſation of joy. I
remembered, the dreadful vengeance
which the marquis had ſworn to execute
upon me if I ever, by any means, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to make known the place of my
concealment; and though life had long
been a burden to me, I dared not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
the certainty of being murdered.
I alſo well knew that no perſon who
might diſcover my ſituation could effect
my enlargement; for I had no relations
to deliver me by force, and the marquis,
you know, has not only power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon,
but alſo the right of life and
death in his own domains. I, therefore,
forbore to anſwer the call, though I
could not entirely repreſs my lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I long perplexed myſelf with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to account for this ſtrange
circumſtance, and am to this moment
ignorant of its cauſe."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0793800202:178"/>
Julia remembering that Ferdinand
had been confined in a dungeon of the
caſtle, it inſtantly occurred to her that
his priſon, and that of the marchioneſs,
were not far diſtant; and ſhe ſcrupled
not to believe that it was his voice which
her mother had heard. She was right
in this belief, and it was indeed the
marchioneſs whoſe groans had formerly
cauſed Ferdinand ſo much alarm, both
in the marble hall of the ſouth build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and in his dungeon.</p>
            <p>When Julia communicated her opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the marchioneſs believed that
ſhe had heard the voice of her
ſon—her emotion was extreme, and it was ſome
time before ſhe could reſume her narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>"A ſhort time ſince," continued the
marchioneſs, "the marquis brought me
a fortnight's proviſion, and told me that
I ſhould probably ſee him no more till
the expiration of that term. His ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
at this period you have explained
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0793800202:179"/>
in your account of the tranſactions
at the abbey of St. Auguſtin. How can
I ever ſufficiently acknowledge the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
I owe to my dear and invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
friend Madame de Menon! Oh!
that it might be permitted me to teſtify
my gratitude."</p>
            <p>Julia attended to the narrative of her
mother in ſilent aſtonishment, and gave
all the ſympathy which ſorrow could
demand. "Surely" cried ſhe, "the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
on whom you have ſo firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied,
and whoſe inflictions you have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with a fortitude ſo noble, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
me through a labyrinth of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
to this ſpot, for the purpoſe of
delivering you! Oh! let us haſten to fly
this horrid abode—let us ſeek to eſcape
through the cavern by which I entered."</p>
            <p>She pauſed, in earneſt expectation
awaiting a reply. "Whither can I
fly?" ſaid the marchioneſs, deeply ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
This queſtion ſpoken with the
emphaſis of deſpair, affected Julia to
tears, and ſhe was for a while ſilent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0793800202:180"/>
"The marquis," reſumed Julia,
"would know not where to ſeek you, or
if he found you beyond his own domains,
would fear to claim you. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
may afford for the preſent a ſafe
aſylum; and whatever ſhall happen,
ſurely no fate you may hereafter encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
can be more dreadful than the one
you now experience."</p>
            <p>The marchioneſs aſſented to the truth
of this, yet her broken ſpirits, the effect
of long ſorrow and confinement, made
her heſitate how to act; and there was
a kind of placid deſpair in her look,
which too faithfully depictured her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
It was obvious to Julia that the
cavern ſhe had paſſed wound beneath
the range of mountains on whoſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
ſide ſtood the caſtle of Mazzini.
The hills thus riſing, formed a ſcreen
which muſt entirely conceal their emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
from the mouth of the cave, and
their flight, from thoſe in the caſtle.
She repreſented theſe circumſtances to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0793800202:181"/>
her mother, and urged them ſo forcibly,
that the lethargy of deſpair yielded to
hope, and the marchioneſs committed,
herſelf to the conduct of her daughter.</p>
            <p>"Oh! let me lead you to light and
life!"cried Julia with warm enthuſiaſm.
"Surely heaven can bleſs me with no
greater good than by making me the
deliverer of my mother." They both,
knelt down; and the marchioneſs with
that affecting, eloquence which true piety
inſpires, and with that confidence
which had ſupported her through ſo
many miſeries, committed herſelf to the
protection of God, and implored his
favour on their attempt.</p>
            <p>They aroſe, but as they converſed
farther on their plan, Julia recollected
that ſhe was deſtitute of money—the
banditti having robbed her of all! The
ſudden ſhock produced by this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
almoſt ſubdued her ſpirits;
never till this moment had ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the value of money. But ſhe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0793800202:182"/>
commanded her feelings, and reſolved
to conceal this circumſtance from the
marchioneſs, preferring the chance of
any evil they might encounter from
without, to the certain miſery of this
terrible impriſonment.</p>
            <p>Having taken what proviſion the
marquis had brought, they quitted the
cell, and entered upon the dark paſſage,
along which they paſſed with cautious
ſteps. Julia came firſt to the door of
the cavern, but who can paint her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
when ſhe found it was faſtened!
All her efforts to open it were ineffectual.—The
door which had cloſed after her,
was held by a ſpring lock, and could
be opened on this ſide only with a key.
When ſhe underſtood this circumſtance,
the marchioneſs, with a placid reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which ſeemed to exalt her above
humanity, addreſſed herſelf again to
heaven, and turned back to her cell.
Here Julia indulged without reſerve,
and without ſcruple, the exceſs of her
grief. The marchioneſs wept over her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0793800202:183"/>
"Not for myſelf," ſaid ſhe, "do I grieve,—I
have too long been inured to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to ſink under its preſſure. This
diſappointment is intrinſically, perhaps,
little—for I had no certain refuge
from calamity—and had it even been
otherwiſe, a few years only of ſuffering
would have been ſpared me. It is for
you, Julia, who ſo much lament my
fate; and who, in being thus delivered
to the power of your father, are ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to the duke de Luovo—that my
heart ſwells."</p>
            <p>Julia could make no reply, but by
preſſing to her lips the hand which
was held forth to her. She ſaw all the
wretchedneſs of her ſituation; and her
fearful uncertainty concerning Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus
and Ferdinand, formed no inferior
part of her affliction.</p>
            <p>"If," reſumed the marchioneſs,
"you prefer impriſonment with your
mother, to a marriage with the duke,
you may ſtill ſecrete yourſelf in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0793800202:184"/>
we have juſt quitted, and ſhare the
proviſion which is brought me."</p>
            <p>"O! talk not, madam, of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with the duke," ſaid Julia; "ſurely
any fate is preferable to that. But
when I conſider that in remaining here, I
am condemned only to the ſufferings
which my mother has ſo long endured,
and that this confinement will enable
me to ſoften, by tender ſympathy, the
aſperity of her misfortunes, I ought to
ſubmit to my preſent ſituation with
complacency, even did a marriage with
the duke appear leſs hateful to me."</p>
            <p>"Excellent girl!" exclaimed the
marchioneſs, claſping Julia to her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom;
"the ſufferings you lament are
almoſt repaid by this proof of your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and affection!" Alas! that I ſhould
have been ſo long deprived of ſuch a
daughter!</p>
            <p>Julia now endeavoured to imitate the
fortitude of her mother, and tenderly
concealed her anxiety for Ferdinand
and Hippolitus, the idea of whom
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0793800202:185"/>
inceſſantly haunted her imagination.
When the marquis brought food to
the cell, ſhe retired to the avenue lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the cavern, and eſcaped diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
            <p>THE marquis, meanwhile, whoſe
indefatigable ſearch after Julia
failed of ſucceſs, was ſucceſſively the
ſlave of alternate paſſions, and he pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth the ſpleen of diſappointment on
his unhappy domeſtics.</p>
            <p>The marchioneſs, who may now more
properly be called Maria de Vellorno,
inflamed, by artful inſinuations, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
already irritated, and heightened
with cruel triumph his reſentment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Julia and Madame de Menon.
She repreſented, what his feelings too
acutely acknowledged,—that by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
diſobedience of the firſt, and the
machinations of the laſt, a prieſt had
been enabled to arreſt his authority
as a father—to inſult the ſacred honour
of his nobility—and to overturn at once
his proudeſt ſchemes of power and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.
She declared it her opinion,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0793800202:187"/>
that the <hi>Abate</hi> was acquainted with the
place of Julia's preſent retreat, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
the marquis with want of ſpirit
in thus ſubmitting to be outwitted by a
prieſt, and forbearing an appeal to the
pope, whoſe authority would compel the
<hi>Abate</hi> to reſtore Julia.</p>
            <p>This reproach ſtung the very ſoul of
the marquis; he felt all its force, and
was at the ſame time conſcious of his
inability to obviate it. The effect of
his crimes now fell in ſevere puniſhment
upon his own head. The threatened
ſecret, which was no other than the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
of the marchioneſs, arreſted
his arm of vengeance, and compelled
him to ſubmit to inſult and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But the reproach of Maria ſunk
deep in his mind; it fomented his pride
into redoubled fury, and he now repell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with diſdain the idea of ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>He revolved the means which might
effect his purpoſe—he ſaw but one—this
was the death of the marchioneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0793800202:188"/>
The commiſſion of one crime often
requires the perpetration of another.
When once we enter on the labyrinth of
vice, we can ſeldom return, but are led
on through correſpondent mazes to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction.
To obviate the effect of his firſt
crime, it was now neceſſary the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
ſhould commit a ſecond, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the <hi>impriſonment</hi> of the marchioneſs
by her <hi>murder.</hi> Himſelf the only liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
witneſs of her exiſtence, when ſhe
was removed, the allegations of the
<hi>Padre Abate</hi> would by this means be
unſupported by any proof, and he might
then boldly appeal to the pope for the
reſtoration of his child.</p>
            <p>He muſed upon this ſcheme, and the
more he accuſtomed his mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
it, the leſs ſcrupulous he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came.
The crime from which he would
formerly have ſhrunk, he now ſurveyed
with a ſteady eye. The fury of his
paſſions, unaccuſtomed to reſiſtance,
uniting with the force of what ambition
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0793800202:189"/>
termed neceſſity—urged him to the
deed, and he determined upon the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his wife. The means of effecting
his purpoſe were eaſy and various; but
as he was not yet ſo entirely hardened
as to be able to view her dying pangs,
and embrue his own hands in her blood,
he choſe to diſpatch her by means of
priſon, which he reſolved to mingle in
her food.</p>
            <p>But a new affliction was preparing
for the marquis, which attacked him
where he was moſt vulnerable; and the
veil which had ſo long overſhadowed his
reaſon was now to be removed. He was
informed by Baptiſta of the infidelity of
Maria de Vellorno. In the firſt emotion
of paſſion, he ſpurned the informer from
his preſence, and diſdained to believe
the circumſtance. A little reflection
changed the object of his reſentment;
he recalled the ſervant, whoſe faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
he had no reaſon to diſtruſt, and
condeſcended to interrogate him on the
ſubject of his misfortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0793800202:190"/>
He learned that an intimacy had for
ſome time ſubſiſted between Maria and
the cavalier de Vincini; and that the
aſſignation was uſually held at the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villion
on the ſea ſhore, in an evening.
Baptiſta farther declared, that if the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
deſired a confirmation of his words,
he might obtain it by viſiting this ſpot
at the hour mentioned.</p>
            <p>This information lighted up the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
paſſions of his nature; his former
ſufferings faded away before the ſtronger
influence of the preſent misfortune, and
it ſeemed as if he had never taſted mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
till now. To ſuſpect the wife upon
whom he doated with romantic fondneſs,
on whom he had centered all his firmeſt
hopes of happineſs, and for whoſe ſake
he had committed the crime which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered
even his preſent moments, and
which would involve him in ſtill deeper
guilt—to find <hi>her</hi> ungrateful to his love,
and a traitoreſs to his honour—produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a miſery more poignant than any his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0793800202:191"/>
imagination had conceived. He was
torn by contending paſſions, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
reſolutions:—now he reſolved to
expiate her guilt with her blood—and
now he melted in all the ſoftneſs of love.
Vengeance and honour bade him ſtrike
to the heart which had betrayed him,
and urged him inſtantly to the deed—when
the idea of her beauty—her win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſmiles—her fond endearments ſtole
upon his fancy, and ſubdued his heart;
he almoſt wept to the idea of injuring
her, and in ſpight of appearances, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
her faithful. The ſucceeding
moment plunged him again in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
his tortures acquired new vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
from ceſſation, and again he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
all the phrenzy of deſpair.
He was now reſolved to end his doubts
by repairing to the pavillion; but again
his heart wavered in irreſolution how to
proceed ſhould his fears be confirmed.
In the mean time he determined to
watch the behaviour of Maria with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
vigilance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0793800202:192"/>
They met at dinner, and he obſerved
her cloſely, but diſcovered not the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
impropriety in her conduct. Her
ſmiles and her beauty again wound their
faſcinations round his heart, and in the
exceſs of their influence he was almoſt
tempted to repair the injury which his
late ſuſpicions had done her, by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them at her feet. The appearance
of the cavalier de Vincini, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
his ſuſpicions; his heart throbbed
wildly, and with reſtleſs impatience he
watched the return of evening, which
would remove his ſuſpence.</p>
            <p>Night at length came. He repaired to
the pavillion, and ſecreted himſelf
among the trees that embowered it.
Many minutes had not paſſed, when he
heard a ſound of low whiſpering voices
ſteal from among the trees, and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
approaching down the alley. He
ſtood almoſt petrified with terrible ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
and preſently heard ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
enter the pavillion. The marquis
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0793800202:193"/>
now emerged from his hiding place; a
faint light iſſued from the building.
He ſtole to the window, and beheld
within, Maria and the cavalier de Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cini.
Fired at the ſight, he drew his
ſword, and ſprang forward. The ſound
of his ſtep alarmed the cavalier, who,
on perceiving the marquis, ruſhed by
him from the pavillion, and diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among the woods. The marquis
purſued, but could not overtake him;
and he returned to the pavillion with
an intention of plunging his ſword in
the heart of Maria, when he diſcovered
her ſenſeleſs on the ground. Pity now
ſuſpended his vengeance; he pauſed in
agonizing gaze upon her, and returned
his ſword into the ſcabbard.</p>
            <p>She revived, but on obſerving the
marquis, ſcreamed and relapſed. He
haſtened to the caſtle for aſſiſtance; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting,
to conceal his diſgrace, ſome
pretence for her ſudden illneſs, and ſhe
was conveyed to her chamber.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0793800202:194"/>
The marquis was now not ſuffered
to doubt her infidelity, but the paſſion
which her conduct abuſed, her faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs
could not ſubdue; he ſtill
doated with abſurd fondneſs, and even
regretted that uncertainty could no
longer flattered him with hope. It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as if his deſire of her affection en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
with his knowledge of the loſs
of it; and the very circumſtance which
ſhould have rouſed his averſion, by a
ſtrange perverſity of diſpoſition, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to heighten his paſſion, and to make
him think it impoſſible he could exiſt
without her.</p>
            <p>When the firſt energy of his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was ſubſided, he determined,
therefore, to reprove and to puniſh, but
hereafter to reſtore her to favour.</p>
            <p>In this reſolution he went to her
apartment, and reprehended her falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in terms of juſt indignation.</p>
            <p>Maria de Vellorno, in whom the late
diſcovery had rouſed reſentment, inſtead
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0793800202:195"/>
of awakening penitence; and exaſperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
pride without exciting ſhame,—heard
the upbraidings of the marquis
with impatience, and replied to them
with acrimonious violence.</p>
            <p>She boldly aſſerted her innocence, and
inſtantly invented a ſtory, the plauſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of which might have deceived a
man who had evidence leſs certain than
his ſenſes to contradict it. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
with a haughtineſs the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent;
and when ſhe perceived that the
marquis was no longer to be miſled, and
that her violence failed to accompliſh
its purpoſe, ſhe had recourſe to tears and
ſupplications. But the artifice was too
glaring to ſucceed; and the marquis
quitted her apartment in an agony of
reſentment.</p>
            <p>His former faſcinations, however,
quickly returned, and again held him
in ſuſpenſion between love and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.
That the vehemence of his
paſſion however, might not want an
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0793800202:196"/>
object, he ordered Baptiſta to diſcover
the retreat of the cavalier de Vincini,
on whom he meant to revenge his loſt
honour. Shame forbade him to employ
others in the ſearch.</p>
            <p>This diſcovery ſuſpended for a while
the operations of that fatal ſcheme,
which had before employed the thoughts
of the marquis; but it had only ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—not
deſtroyed them. The late oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
had annihilated his domeſtic
happineſs; but his pride now roſe to
reſcue him from deſpair, and he centered
all his future hopes upon ambition. In
a moment of cool reflection, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
that he had derived neither hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
nor content from the purſuit of
diſſipated pleaſures, to which he had
hitherto ſacrificed every oppoſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
He reſolved, therefore, to
abandon the gay ſchemes of diſſipation
which had formerly allured him, and
dedicate himſelf entirely to ambition,
in the purſuits and delights of which
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0793800202:197"/>
he hoped to bury all his cares. He
therefore became more earneſt than
ever for the marriage of Julia with the
duke de Luovo, through whoſe means
he deſigned to involve himſelf in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of the ſtate, and determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
her at whatever conſequence. He
reſolved without further delay to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to the pope; but to do this with
ſafety, it was neceſſary that the marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs
ſhould die; and he returned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the conſideration and execution
of his diabolical purpoſe.</p>
            <p>He mingled a poiſonous drug with
the food he deſigned for her; and when
night arrived, carried it to the cell.
As he unlocked the door, his hand
trembled; and when he preſented the
food, and looked conſciouſly for the laſt
time upon the marchioneſs, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it with humble thankfulneſs, his
heart almoſt relented. His countenance,
over which was diffuſed the paleneſs of
death, expreſſed the ſecret movements
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0793800202:198"/>
of his ſoul, and he gazed upon her with
eyes of ſtiffened horror. Alarmed by
his looks, ſhe fell upon her knees to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
his pity.</p>
            <p>Her attitude recalled his bewildered
ſenſes; and endeavouring to aſſume a
tranquil aſpect, he bade her riſe, and
inſtantly quitted the cell, fearful of the
inſtability of his purpoſe. His mind
was not yet ſufficiently hardened by
guilt to repel the arrows of conſcience,
and his imagination reſponded to her
power. As he paſſed through the long
dreary paſſages from the priſon, ſolemn
and myſterious ſounds ſeemed to ſpeak
in every murmur of the blaſt which
crept along their windings, and he often
ſtarted and looked back.</p>
            <p>He reached his chamber, and having
ſhut the door, ſurveyed the room in
fearful examination. Ideal forms flitted
before his fancy, and for the firſt time
in his life he feared to be alone. Shame
only with-held him from calling Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0793800202:199"/>
The gloom of the hour, and the
death-like ſilence that prevailed, aſſiſted
the horrors of his imagination. He half
repented of the deed, yet deemed it
now too late to obviate it; and he threw
himſelf on his bed in terrible emotion.
His head grew dizzy, and a ſudden
faintneſs overcame him; he heſitated,
and at length aroſe to ring for aſſiſtance,
but found himſelf unable to ſtand.</p>
            <p>In a few moments he was ſomewhat
revived, and rang his beil; but before
any perſon appeared, he was ſeized with
terrible pains, and ſtaggering to his bed,
ſunk ſenſeleſs upon it. Here Baptiſta,
who was the firſt perſon that entered
his room, found him ſtruggling, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
in the agonies of death. The
whole caſtle was immediately rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the confuſion may be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
imagined than deſcribed. Emilia
amid the general alarm came to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
room, but the ſight of him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
her, and ſhe was carried from his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0793800202:200"/>
preſence. By the help of proper appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
the marquis recovered his ſenſes,
and his pains had a ſhort ceſſation.</p>
            <p>"I am dying," ſaid he, in a faulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accent; "send inſtantly for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs
and my ſon."</p>
            <p>Ferdinand in eſcaping from the hands
of the banditti, it was now ſeen had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into the power of his father. He
had been ſince confined in an apartment
of the caſtle, and was now liberated to
obey the ſummons. The countenance
of the marquis exhibited a ghaſtly
image; Ferdinand, when he drew near
the bed, ſuddenly ſhrunk back, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with horror. The marquis now
beckoned his attendants to quit the
room, and they were preparing to obey,
when a violent noiſe was heard from
without; almoſt in the same inſtant the
door of the apartment was thrown open,
and the ſervant who had been ſent for
the marchioneſs, ruſhed in. His look
alone declared the horror of his mind,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0793800202:201"/>
for words he had none to utter. He
ſtared wildly, and pointed to the gallery
he had quitted. Ferdinand, ſeized
with new terror, ruſhed the way he
pointed to the apartment of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs.
A ſpectacle of horror pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
itſelf. Maria lay on a couch
lifeleſs, and bathed in blood. A poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,
the inſtrument of her deſtruction,
was on the floor; and it appeared from
a letter which was found on the couch
beſide her, that ſhe had died by her
own hand. The paper contained theſe
words:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <head>TO THE MARQUIS DE MAZZINI.</head>
                  <p>YOUR words have ſtabbed my
heart. No power on earth could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
the peace you have deſtroyed.
I will eſcape from my torture. When
you read this, I ſhall be no more.
But the triumph ſhall no longer be
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0793800202:202"/>
your's—the draught you have drank
was given by the hand of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>MARIA DE MAZZINI.</signed>
                  </closer>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>It now appeared that the marquis
was poiſoned by the vengeance of the
woman for whom he had reſigned his
conſcience. The conſternation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
of Ferdinand cannot eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
he haſtened back to his father's
chamber, but determined to conceal
the dreadful cataſtrophe of Maria de
Vellorno. This precaution, however,
was uſeleſs; for the ſervants, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation
of terror, had revealed it, and
the marquis had fainted.</p>
            <p>Returning pains recalled his ſenſes,
and the agonies he ſuffered were too
ſhocking for the beholders. Medical
endeavours were applied, but the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was too powerful for antidote. The
marquis's pains at length ſubſided; the
poiſon had exhauſted moſt its rage,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0793800202:203"/>
and he became tolerably eaſy. He
waved his hand for the attendants to
leave the room; and beckoning to Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,
whoſe ſenſes were almoſt ſtun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by this accumulation of horror, bade
him ſit down beſide him. "The hand
of death is now upon me," ſaid he;
"I would employ theſe laſt moments
in revealing a deed, which is more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to me than all the bodily agonies I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.
It will be ſome relief to me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it." Ferdinand graſped the hand of
the marquis in ſpeechleſs terror. "The
retribution of heaven is upon me," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
the marquis. "My puniſhment
is the immediate conſequence of my
guilt. Heaven has made that woman
the inſtrument of its juſtice, whom I
made the inſtrument of my crimes;—that
woman for whoſe ſake I forgot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and braved vice—for whom I
impriſoned an innocent wife, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
murdered her."</p>
            <p>At theſe words every nerve of Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0793800202:204"/>
thrilled; he let go the marquis's
hand, and ſtarted back. "Look not
ſo fiercely on me," ſaid the marquis, in
a hollow voice;"your eyes ſtrike death
to my ſoul; my conſcience needs not
this additional pang." "My mother!"
exclaimed Ferdinand—"my mother!
Speak, tell me"—"I have no breath,"
ſaid the marquis. "Oh!—Take theſe
keys—the ſouth tower—the trap-door.—"Tis
poſſible—Oh!—"</p>
            <p>The marquis made a ſudden ſpring
upwards, and fell lifeleſs on the bed.
The attendants were called in, but he
was gone for ever. His laſt words ſtruck
with the force of lightning upon the
mind of Ferdinand; they ſeemed to ſay
that his mother might yet exiſt. He
took the keys; and ordering ſome of the
ſervants to follow, haſtened to the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
building; he proceeded to the
tower, and the trap-door beneath the
ſtair-caſe was lifted. They all deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a dark paſſage, which conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0793800202:205"/>
them through ſeveral intricacies to
to the door of the cell. Ferdinand in
trembling horrible expectation, applied
the key; the door opened, and he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—but
what was his ſurprize when he
found no perſon in the cell! He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that he had miſtaken the place,
and quitted it for farther ſearch; but,
having followed the windings of the
paſſage, by which he entered, without
diſcovering any other door, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a more exact examination of the
cell. He now obſerved the door which
led to the cavern, and he entered upon
the avenue, but no perſon was found
there, and no voice anſwered to his call.
Having reached the door of the cavern,
which was faſtened, he returned loſt in
grief, and meditating upon the laſt
words of the marquis. He now thought
that he had miſtaken their import, and
that the words "tis poſſible," were
not meant to apply to the life of the
marchioneſs. He concluded that the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0793800202:206"/>
murder had been committed at a diſtant
period; and he reſolved, therefore, to
have the ground of the cell dug up,
and the remains of his mother ſought
for.</p>
            <p>When the firſt violence of the emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
excited by the late ſcenes was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided,
he enquired concerning Maria
de Vellorno.</p>
            <p>It appeared that on the day preceding
this horrid tranſaction, the marquis had
paſſed ſome hours in her apartment;
that they were heard in loud diſpute;—that
the paſſion of the marquis grew
high;—that he upbraided her with her
paſſed conduct, and threatened her with
a formal ſeparation. When the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
quitted her, ſhe was heard walking
quick through the room, in a paſſion of
tears; ſhe often ſuddenly ſtopped in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
but incoherent exclamation;
and at laſt threw herſelf on the floor,
and was for ſome time entirely ſtill.
Here her woman found her, upon whoſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0793800202:207"/>
entrance ſhe aroſe haſtily, and reproved
her for appearing un-called. After this
ſhe remained ſilent and ſullen.</p>
            <p>She deſcended to ſupper, where the
marquis met her alone at table. Little
was ſaid during the repaſt, at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of which the ſervants were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed;
and it was believed that during
the interval between ſupper, and the
hour of repoſe, Maria de Vellorno con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
to mingle poiſon with the wine
of the marquis. How ſhe had procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this poiſon was never diſcovered.</p>
            <p>She retired early to her chamber;
and her woman obſerving that ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
much agitated, enquired if ſhe
was ill. To this ſhe returned a ſhort
anſwer in the negative, and her woman
was ſoon afterwards diſmiſſed. But ſhe
had hardly ſhut the door of the room,
when ſhe heard her lady's voice recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her. She returned, and received
ſome trifling order, and obſerved that
Maria looked uncommonly pale; there
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0793800202:208"/>
was beſides, a wildneſs in her eyes which
frightened her, but ſhe did not dare to
aſk any queſtions. She again quitted
the room, and had only reached the
extremity of the gallery, when her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs's
bell rang. She haſtened back.
Maria enquired if the marquis was gone
to bed, and if all was quiet. Being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
in the affirmative, ſhe replied,
"This is a ſtill hour, and a dark
one!—Good night!"</p>
            <p>Her woman having once more left
the room, ſtopped at the door to liſten;
but all within remaining ſilent, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to reſt.</p>
            <p>It is probable that Maria perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
the fatal act ſoon after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of her woman; for when ſhe
was found two hours afterwards, ſhe
appeared to have been dead ſome time.
On examination a wound was diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on her left ſide, which had doubtleſs
penetrated to the heart, from the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneſs
of her death, and from the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of blood which had followed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0793800202:209"/>
Theſe terrible events ſo deeply affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Emilia, that ſhe was confined to her
bed by a dangerous illneſs. Ferdinand
ſtruggled againſt the ſhock with manly
fortitude. But amid all the tumult of
the preſent ſcenes, his uncertainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Julia, whom he had left in the
hands of banditti, and whom he had
been with-held from ſeeking or reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
formed perhaps the moſt affecting
part of his diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>The late marquis de Mazzini, and
Maria de Vellorno, were interred with
the honour due to their rank in the
church of the convent of St. Nicolo.
Their lives exhibited a boundleſs indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of violent and luxurious paſſions,
and their deaths marked the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſuch indulgence, and held forth
to makind a ſingular inſtance of divine
vengeance.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
            <p>IN turning up the ground of the cell,
it was diſcovered that it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
with the dungeon in which
Ferdinand had been confined, and where
he had heard thoſe groans which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
him ſo much terror.</p>
            <p>The ſtory which the marquis for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
related to his ſon concerning the
ſouthern buildings, it was now evident
was fabricated for the purpoſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
the impriſonment of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs.
In the choice of his ſubject,
he certainly diſcovered ſome art; for
the circumſtance related was calculated,
by impreſſing terror, to prevent farther
enquiry into the receſſes of theſe build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
It ſerved alſo to explain by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-natural
evidence the cauſe of thoſe
ſounds, and of that appearance which
had been there obſerved, but which
were in reality occaſioned only by the
marquis.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0793800202:211"/>
The event of the examination in the
cell threw Ferdinand into new perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.
The marquis had confeſſed that
he poiſoned his wife—yet her remains
were not to be found; and the place
which he ſignified to be that of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement,
bore no veſtige of her having
been there. There appeared no way
by which ſhe could have eſcaped from
her priſon; for both the door which
opened upon the cell, and that which
terminated the avenue beyond, were
faſtened when tried by Ferdinand.</p>
            <p>But the young marquis had no time
for uſeleſs ſpeculation—ſerious duties
called upon him. He believed that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
was ſtill in the power of banditti;
and on the concluſion of his father's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
he ſet forward himſelf to Palermo
to give information of the abode of the
robbers, and to repair with the officers
of juſtice, accompanied by a party of
his own people, to the reſcue of his
ſiſter. On his arrival at Palermo he
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0793800202:212"/>
was informed that a banditti, whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
had been among the ruins of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,
ſituated in the foreſt of Maren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino,
was already diſcovered; that their
abode had been ſearched, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſecured for examples of public
juſtice—but that no captive lady had
been found amongſt them. This lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
intelligence excited in Ferdinand a
very ſerious diſtreſs, and he was wholly
unable to conjecture her fate. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
leave, however, to interrogate
thoſe of the robbers, who were impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
at Palermo, but could draw from
them no ſatisfactory or certain inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>At length he quitted Palermo for the
foreſt of Marentino, thinking it poſſible
that Julia might be heard of in its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.
He travelled on in melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
and dejection, and evening over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
him long before he reached the
place of his deſtination. The night
came on heavily in clouds, and a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0793800202:213"/>
ſtorm of wind and rain aroſe. The
road lay through a wild and rocky coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and Ferdinand could obtain no
ſhelter. His attendants offered him their
cloaks, but he refuſed to expoſe a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the hardſhip he would not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
endure. He travelled for ſome miles
in a heavy rain; and the wind, which
howled mournfully among the rocks,
and whoſe ſolemn pauſes were filled by
the diſtant roarings of the ſea, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
the deſolation of the ſcene. At
length he diſcerned amid the darkneſs
from a far, a red light waving in the
wind; it varied with the blaſt, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
totally diſappeared. He puſhed his
horſes into a gallop, and made towards
it.</p>
            <p>The flame continued to direct his
courſe; and on a nearer approach, he
perceived by the red reflection of its
fires, ſtreaming a long radiance upon
the waters beneath—a light-houſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
upon a point of rock which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hung
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0793800202:214"/>
the ſea. He knocked for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and the door was opened by an
old man, who bade him welcome.</p>
            <p>Within appeared a cheerful blazing
fire, round which were ſeated ſeveral
perſons, who ſeemed like himſelf to
have ſought ſhelter from the tempeſt of
the night. The ſight of the fire cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, and he advanced towards it,
when a ſudden ſcream ſeized his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the company roſe up in confuſion,
and in the ſame inſtant he diſcovered
Julia and Hippolitus. The joy of that
moment is not to be deſcribed, but his
attention was quickly called off from his
own ſituation to that of a lady, who
during the general tranſport had faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
His ſenſations on learning ſhe was
his mother can only be conceived.</p>
            <p>She revived. "My ſon!" ſaid ſhe,
in a languid voice, as ſhe preſſed him
to her heart. "Great God, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed!
Surely this moment may
repay a life of miſery!" He could only
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0793800202:215"/>
receive her careſſes in ſilence; but the
ſudden tears which ſtarted in his eyes,
ſpoke a language too expreſſive to be
miſunderſtood.</p>
            <p>When the firſt emotion of the ſcene
was paſſed, Julia enquired by what
means Ferdinand had come to this ſpot.
He anſwered her generally, and avoided
for the preſent entering upon the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſubject of the late events at the
caſtle of Mazzini. Julia related the
hiſtory of her adventures ſince ſhe parted
with her brother. In her narration, it
appeared that Hippolitus, who was
taken by the duke de Luovo, at the
mouth of the cave, had afterwards eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped,
and returned to the cavern in
ſearch of Julia. The low receſs in the
rock, through which Julia had paſſed,
he perceived by the light of his flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau.
He penetrated to the cavern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond,
and from thence to the priſon of
the marchioneſs. No colour of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
can paint the ſcene which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
it is ſufficient to ſay that the whole
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0793800202:216"/>
party agreed to quit the cell at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of night. But this being a night
on which it was known the marquis
would viſit the priſon, they agreed to
defer their departure till after his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
and thus elude the danger to
be expected from an early diſcovery of
the eſcape of the marchioneſs.</p>
            <p>At the ſound of footſteps above, Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus
and Julia had ſecreted themſelves
in the avenue; and immediately on the
marquis's departure they all repaired to
the cavern, leaving in the hurry of
their flight untouched the poiſonous
food he had brought. Having eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
from thence they proceeded to
a neighbouring village, where horſes
were procured to carry them towards
Palermo. Here after a tedious jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
they arrived, in the deſign of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking
for Italy. Contrary winds had
detained them till the day on which
Ferdinand left that city, when apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and weary of delay, they hired a
ſmall veſſel, and determined to brave
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0793800202:217"/>
the winds. They had ſoon reaſon to
repent their temerity; for the veſſel had
not been long at ſea when the ſtorm
aroſe, which threw them back upon the
ſhores of Sicily, and brought them to
the light-houſe, where they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by Ferdinand.</p>
            <p>On the following morning Ferdinand
returned with his friends to Palermo,
where he firſt diſcloſed the late fatal
events of the caſtle. They now ſettled
their future plans; and Ferdinand haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
to the caſtle of Mazzini to fetch
Emilia, and to give orders for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of his houſehold to his palace at
Naples, where he deſigned to fix his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
reſidence. The diſtreſs of Emilia,
whom he found recovered from her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition,
yielded to joy and wonder,
when ſhe heard of the exiſtence of her
mother, and the ſafety of her ſiſter.
She departed with Ferdinand for Paler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,
where her friends awaited her, and
where the joy of the meeting was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
heightened by the appearance
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0793800202:218"/>
of Madame de Menon, for whom the
marchioneſs had diſpatched a meſſenger
to St. Auguſtin's. Madame had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the abbey for another convent, to
which however the meſſenger was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
This happy party now embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Naples.</p>
            <p>From this period the caſtle of Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zini,
which had been the theatre of a
dreadful cataſtrophe, and whoſe ſcenes
would have revived in the minds of the
chief perſonages connected with it,
painful and ſhocking recollections—was
abandoned.</p>
            <p>On their arrival at Naples, Ferdinand
preſented to the king a clear and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
account of the late events at the
caſtle, in conſequence of which the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs
was confirmed in her rank, and
Ferdinand was received as the ſixth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
de Mazzini.</p>
            <p>The marchioneſs, thus reſtored to
the world, and to happineſs, reſided
with her children in the palace at Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
where, after time had ſomewhat
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0793800202:219"/>
mellowed the remembrance of the late
calamity, the nuptials of Hippolitus and
Julia were celebrated. The recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the difficulties they had encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and of the diſtreſs they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
for each other, now ſerved only
to heighten by contraſt the happineſs of
the preſent period.</p>
            <p>Ferdinand ſoon after accepted a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in the Neapolitan army; and
amidſt the many heroes of that warlike
and turbulent age, diſtinguiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for his valour and ability. The
occupations of war engaged his mind,
while his heart was occupied in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
the happineſs of his family.</p>
            <p>Madame de Menon, whoſe generous
attachment to the marchioneſs had been
fully proved, found in the reſtoration of
her friend a living witneſs of her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and thus recovered thoſe eſtates
which had been unjuſtly with-held from
her. But the marchioneſs and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
grateful to her friendſhip, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0793800202:220"/>
to her virtues, prevailed upon
her to ſpend the remainder of her life
at the palace of Mazzini.</p>
            <p>Emilia, wholly attached to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
continued to reſide with the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs,
who ſaw her race renewed in
the children of Hippolitus and Julia.
Thus ſurrounded by her children and
friends, and engaged in forming the
minds of the infant generation, ſhe
ſeemed to forget that ſhe had ever been
otherwiſe than happy."</p>
            <p>Here the manuſcript annals conclude.
In reviewing this ſtory, we perceive a
ſingular and ſtriking inſtance of moral
retribution. We learn alſo, that thoſe
who do only THAT WHICH IS
RIGHT, endure nothing in misfortune
but a trial of their virtue, and from trials
well endured, derive the ſureſt claim to
the protection of heaven.</p>
