            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>ISAIAH xi. 9.</bibl> They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy
Mountain: For the Earth ſhall be full of
the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters
cover the Sea.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Paſſage of Scripture is underſtood,
by all Chriſtian Interpreters, to refer
to the Days of the Goſpel. The Prophet is
deſcribing in the Context the Influence of the
<hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s Reign, extending thro' all Nature,
and producing univerſal Happineſs. This, in
its full Accompliſhment, doubtleſs, is yet fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and reſpects ſome more advanced Period
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0135602100:3"/>
of the Kingdom of God, foretold in other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of the prophetick Writings; when true
Religion ſhall univerſally prevail, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Tendency of the Goſpel attain its entire
Effect. In the Proſpect of this, the Prophet
ſeems to riſe above himſelf, and celebrates thoſe
happy Days in the moſt ſublime, figurative
Strain of Eaſtern Poetry. He opens a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
View of the State of the World, as a State
of returning Innocence. He repreſents all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
flouriſhing in Peace; Diſcord and Guile
aboliſhed; the moſt hoſtile Natures reconciled,
and the moſt ſavage tamed and reformed. <hi>The
Wolf alſo ſhall dwell with the Lamb; and the
Leopard ſhall ly down with the Kid: And the
Calf and the young Lion, and the Fatling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and a little Child ſhall lead them. And the
Cow and the Bear ſhall feed, their young Ones
ſhall ly down together; and the Lion ſhall eat
Straw like the Ox; and the ſucking Child ſhall
play on the Hole of the Aſp, and the weaned Child
ſhall put his Hand on the Cockatrice Den. They
ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
For</hi> (aſſigning in the Text the Cauſe of
this great and happy Revolution) <hi>the Earth ſhall
be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
cover the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0135602100:4"/>
UPON reading theſe Words, we muſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
perceive the great <hi>Encouragement</hi> they
give to all good Deſigns, for promoting Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in the World. When we engage in this
Cauſe, we have the Comfort, not only of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
engaged in a <hi>good</hi> Cauſe, but alſo in one
that will undoubtedly be <hi>ſucceſsful.</hi> For we
are here aſſured, by the Divine Promiſe, that
Truth and Goodneſs ſhall at length prevail,
and the increaſing Light and Influence of
Religion prove the Cauſe of general Order
and Happineſs. It is a noble and animating
Thought, that, in ſuch Deſigns, we co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with God for advancing the Kingdom of
the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and work upon his Plan with all
the Force of eternal Providence on our Side.
Nor ought we to be diſcouraged by thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable
Circumſtances, which at preſent
ſeem to make againſt us. Tho' the Ignorance,
Superſtition and Corruption that now fill ſo
much of the World, have a dark and myſterious
Aſpect, it is not beyond the Power of that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Being, who brings Light out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to unravel all thoſe perplexed Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and gradually to extricate Mankind from
the Labyrinth of Vice and Error. From the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0135602100:5"/>
               <hi>preſent</hi> State of the World, it is not more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
that the Goſpel ſhall one Day be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
received, and exert its <hi>entire</hi> Influence on
the Hearts of Men; than <hi>once</hi> it was, that it
ſhould reach <hi>ſo far,</hi> and demoliſh <hi>ſo much</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
Superſtition as it has <hi>already</hi> done.
At the Riſe of Chriſtianity, there was as great
a Diſproportion betwixt the apparent human
Cauſes, and the Effect which has been <hi>actually</hi>
produced, as there is, in our Times, betwixt
the Circumſtances of Religion in the World,
and the Effect which we <hi>farther</hi> expect. The
<hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> having exerted its Influence
ſo far, in breaking thro' the thickeſt Darkneſs,
we may juſtly hope, that it is powerful enough
to diſpel all remaining Obſcurity, and that it
will aſcend by Degrees to that <hi>perfect Day,</hi>
when <hi>Healing ſhall be under its Wings</hi> to all the
Nations. <hi>A little One ſhall become a Thouſand,
and a ſmall One a ſtrong Nation: I the Lord will
haſten it in its Time</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. lx. 22.</note>.</p>
            <p>BESIDES this <hi>Encouragement</hi> to our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for advancing Religion, there is to be
obſerved in the Text, a preciſe <hi>Connection</hi> mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0135602100:6"/>
betwixt the Increaſe of religious Knowledge
and the Happineſs of Mankind. <hi>The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Lord filling the Earth,</hi> is diſtinctly
aſſigned as the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> why <hi>they ſhall not hurt nor
deſtroy in all God's holy Mountain.</hi> To this I
am principally to lead your Thoughts; as a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
properly ſuited to the Occaſion of our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and peculiarly <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as I conceive, to
be inculcated, in the preſent Times, which ſeem
to be waxing indifferent, more and more, to all
religious Principles. Whether Chriſtianity ſhall
be propagated further or not, is treated as a
Matter of no great Concern to Mankind. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
prevail, that moral Virtue may ſubſiſt,
with equal Advantage, independent of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For <hi>moral Principles</hi> great Regard is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:
But <hi>Articles of religious Belief</hi> are
thought abſtract Things; remote from Life;
Points of mere Speculation and Debate; of very
inconſiderable Influence on the Actions of
Men. The general Conduct of Mankind, it
is argued, will always proceed upon Principles
and Views of another Nature; and therefore,
religious Knowledge ſtands in no neceſſary
Connection with their Improvement or Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
Fact and Experience is alledged for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0135602100:7"/>
this. Even amongſt many, who would not be
ranged on the Side of Unbelief, this looſe and
indifferent Spirit too much prevails; and hence,
the Profeſſion of Religion amongſt us is too
viſibly ſinking into Diſrepute. How adverſe
all this is to the Deſign which the preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
is intended to recommend, needs not be
ſaid. How adverſe it is to the general Welfare
and moſt real Intereſts of Mankind, I hope,
ſhall be made evident to candid Minds.</p>
            <p>BY the <hi>Knowledge of the Lord,</hi> is not to be
underſtood the natural Knowledge of God only.
It is plain, the Prophet ſpeaks of thoſe Times
of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> when more enlarged Diſcoveries
ſhould be made to Mankind of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and of the Meaſures of the Divine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
than mere unaſſiſted Reaſon could
reach. Our natural Notices of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are not laid aſide by Chriſtianity, but
cleared from Error, confirmed by higher Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and carried into a wider Field. In this
<hi>enlarged</hi> Senſe of religious Knowledge, to make
its Importance to the Happineſs of Mankind
appear, let us conſider Man,<list>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. CONSIDERING Man, in his ſingle Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
as an <hi>Individual,</hi> our Inquiry ſhall here
begin, of what <hi>Importance</hi> it is to him to have
juſt and true Principles of religious Belief. This
divides itſelf unto two grand Branches: With
reſpect, firſt, to his <hi>Improvement;</hi> and next, to
his <hi>Conſolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As to the real <hi>Improvement</hi> of Man; the
Advancement of his Nature in what is morally
valuable and uſeful; the Acquiſition of ſuch
Diſpoſitions and Habits, as fit him for acting
his Part well on this Stage, and prepare him
for a higher State of Life and Action hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
What Benefit does he receive, in theſe
Reſpects, from religious Knowledge and Belief?
It muſt be obvious, that all Increaſe of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is Improvement to the <hi>Underſtanding.</hi>
The further its Sphere extends, the more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that are ſubmitted to its View and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
eſpecially when thoſe Objects are
of intrinſick <hi>Excellence,</hi> the more that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Power, which is the Glory of Man,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0135602100:9"/>
is in the Courſe of attaining its proper Strength
and Maturity. Hence <hi>Truth</hi> is juſtly ſaid to be
<hi>the Food of the Soul.</hi> But were the Knowledge
of Religion merely ſpeculative, tho' the Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
muſt be allowed to be noble, yet leſs
could be ſaid of its Importance. We recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it to Mankind, as forming their <hi>Hearts.</hi>
Pure and exalted Conceptions of the Deity,
ſuch as Religion gives us;—The univerſal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and righteous Governor of the Univerſe;—the
Author of <hi>every good and perfect Gift;</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the Standard of unſpotted Perfection and
Goodneſs;—conducting his whole Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with an eternal Regard to Order, Virtue
and Truth;—ever favouring the Cauſe, and
ſupporting the Intereſts of Righteouſneſs, and
righteous Men;—and applying to this the whole
Force of Omnipotence, and the whole Art of
unerring Wiſdom, from the Beginning to the
End of Things:—Such Conceptions of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
naturally deſcend into the Heart; kindle in
it the <hi>Love</hi> of Goodneſs, and eſtabliſh a Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of its being our higheſt <hi>Intereſt.</hi> They
give a peculiar <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Fortitude</hi> to the
Mind in the Practice of Virtue; and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
a chearful <hi>Acquieſcence</hi> in this ſupremely
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0135602100:10"/>
wiſe and righteous Adminiſtration, <hi>whatever</hi>
Trials and Sufferings may ariſe.</p>
            <p>ALL the Doctrines <hi>peculiar</hi> to Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
are great Improvements of what the
Light of Nature imperfectly ſuggeſts. A Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
of Providence is made known to us,
particularly ſuited to the Exigencies of Man:
Calculated for recovering him from that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and guilty State, into which, <hi>Experience</hi>
bears Witneſs that he is fallen, and reſtoring
him to a State of Integrity and Favour with his
Creator. The Method of carrying on this
great Plan is ſuch as gives us the moſt affecting
Views of the <hi>Importance</hi> of Holineſs and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and of the <hi>high Account</hi> in which it ſtands
with God. The Son of God appearing on the
Earth, and dying as a <hi>Propitiation for the Sins
of the World,</hi> that he might <hi>bring in everlaſting
Righteouſneſs</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. ix. 24.</note>; that he might <hi>purge our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienceſ
from dead Works, to ſerve the living
God</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. ix. 14.</note>; <hi>that he might redeem us from all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and purify unto himſelf a peculiar People,
zealous of good Works</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Tit. ii. 14.</note>. Such a gracious and
merciful Interpoſition of the Creator of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0135602100:11"/>
World, ſo diſtinguiſhing a Proof of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for the moral Intereſts of Mankind, is
moſt proper to warm the Heart with <hi>Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and <hi>adds</hi> to the Cauſe of Goodneſs the
Force of every Motive from <hi>Gratitude</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
Affection. Theſe Diſcoveries of the
Goſpel have this further Effect, to eſtabliſh an
unſhaken Confidence in God. They afford
ſomething to the Mind, on which it can lay
hold as the <hi>Security</hi> of its Hope; when, with
a Certainty far beyond that of mere <hi>abſtract
Argument,</hi> it appeals to <hi>Matter of Fact;</hi> and
is taught to ſay, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son,
but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not
with him alſo freely give us all Things</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 32.</note>? Hence
the great Encouragement to the <hi>Repentance</hi> and
Reformation of Sinners, from the Hope of
Acceptance with God thro' JESUS CHRIST,
and from the Belief of a Divine Aſſiſtance
communicated to the Upright in Heart. Whilſt
the Government of God is thus rendered moſt
<hi>amiable,</hi> placed in a Light moſt encouraging to
every virtuous Mind; there is, at the ſame
Time, ſomething extremely <hi>awful</hi> and <hi>ſolemn</hi>
in the whole Doctrine of the <hi>Redemption.</hi> It
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0135602100:12"/>
naturally ſtrikes the Mind with Reverence for
the Divine Law; pointing at ſome <hi>deep</hi> Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in Sin, ſome dreadful Conſequences flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from it, <hi>unknown</hi> perhaps in their Cauſes,
and in their <hi>whole</hi> Extent, to the human Mind,
which moved the Creator of the World to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the ordinary Laws of Providence,
and to undertake the Reſtoration of guilty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
by a Method ſo aſtoniſhing. Hence,
Mankind are <hi>awakened</hi> to ſerious Reflection.
Hence, ſuch Views ariſe of the Laws under
which they are placed, and of the Ends of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are bound to fulfil, as give <hi>Solemnity</hi>
to Virtue, and reſtrain them from trifling with
Life: Eſpecially, when to this is joined the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of <hi>Life and Immortality</hi> by the Goſpel;
the Connection in which this Life ſtands with
a future eternal State, for which we are now
under Probation; in a Courſe of Diſcipline;
which, according as by Divine Aſſiſtance it
terminates in our Improvement in Virtue, or,
thro' our own Miſconduct, leaves us in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
unimproved State, will diſmiſs us to laſting
Abodes either of Puniſhment or Reward. This
is far above thoſe faint interrupted Hopes, thoſe
feeble ineffectual Reaſonings, which mere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0135602100:13"/>
Light ſuggeſts, concerning the future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Mankind. Here we find, what alone
can be of any conſiderable Weight with Men
in Practice,—direct Promiſe and Threatning,—an
authoritative Sanction given to a Law,—the
Governor revealed,—and the Motives addreſſed
to Hope and Fear, urged home on the Mind
by, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Nor are Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
wanting to impreſs the <hi>Imagination</hi>
in the livelieſt Manner. The Reſurrection of
the Body, the Solemnity of a future Judgment,
the deciſive Sentence, the final Separation, and
the everlaſting Manſions of the Good and the
Bad, are all ſet forth in ſtrong and affecting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
In ſhort, a great and magnificent <hi>Plan</hi>
of Divine Adminiſtration is in Part opened;
and nothing is omitted that may give Mankind
the deepeſt Senſe of their being all the Subjects
of the <hi>moral Government</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>THE Bounds of this Diſcourſe have allowed
me to give but an imperfect View of the great
Principles of Religion. From theſe Hints, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
we may recollect ſo much of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Doctrine, as will be a ſufficient Foundation
for an Appeal to every impartial Mind, whether
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0135602100:14"/>
the <hi>Knowledge,</hi> the real and firm <hi>Belief</hi> of theſe
Principles of Religion, be not ſtrictly connected
with the <hi>Improvement</hi> of Man; and thereby of
the higheſt Importance to his <hi>Happineſs.</hi> I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
now with thoſe who admit, that to be vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and good is real Improvement and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
Let them lay what Streſs they will
upon Conſcience, upon its natural Authority
within, and the Force and Evidence of its Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates:
Obſtinate ſure they muſt be, who will
not grant, that the natural Tendency of theſe
religious Principles is to <hi>ſupport</hi> the Dictates,
and <hi>confirm</hi> the Authority of Conſcience; to
<hi>awaken,</hi> on various Occaſions, the moſt uſeful
Feelings; to provide <hi>additional</hi> Reſtraints from
Vice, and <hi>additional</hi> Motives to every Virtue.
Who dares ſay, that there is no Caſe in which
Conſcience ſtands in real <hi>Need</hi> of ſuch Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
to <hi>direct,</hi> where there is ſo much Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and Darkneſs; and to <hi>prompt,</hi> where
there is ſo much Feebleneſs and Irreſolution,
and ſuch a fatal Proneneſs to Vice and Folly?</p>
            <p>BUT how good ſoever the <hi>Tendency</hi> of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Principles may be, their <hi>actual</hi> Significan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Influence on Life will ſtill be called in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0135602100:15"/>
Queſtion. This <hi>Tendency</hi> is by various Cauſes
defeated: Betwixt the <hi>Belief</hi> of religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and correſpondent <hi>Practice,</hi> it will be
ſaid, that Experience ſhows there is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Connection; nor can the Propagation of
the <hi>one</hi> at all aſſure us, that proportionable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
will follow in the <hi>other.</hi>—This is
in Part allowed: As we allow, that Knowledge
and Belief admit of various Degrees, before they
arrive at that Chriſtian Faith, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
repreſents as certainly <hi>purifying the Heart.</hi>
But, tho' the Connection be not <hi>neceſſary</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Knowledge and Practice, I hope it will
not be denied, that <hi>ſome</hi> Connection there is.
Here there is <hi>one</hi> Avenue to the Heart. If
the <hi>Tendency</hi> of religious Knowledge be good,
Wiſdom muſt direct, and Duty oblige us to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
it. For <hi>Tendency</hi> will, at leaſt in <hi>ſome</hi>
Caſes, become <hi>effectual;</hi> in <hi>more</hi> Caſes, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
than are taken notice of amidſt the Hurry
of the World. Beſides the <hi>known</hi> and <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed</hi>
Examples of true Religion and Virtue,
which, in every Age of Chriſtianity, have ſhone,
more or leſs, as <hi>Lights of the World:</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
may there be, in the more <hi>ſilent</hi> Scenes of
Life, overlooked by ſuperficial Obſervers of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0135602100:16"/>
Mankind, on whoſe Hearts and Lives religious
Principles have a great and happy Influence?
Even on looſe and giddy Minds, where they
are far from operating their full Effect, their
Influence is not altogether loſt. Religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
are at leaſt a <hi>Clog</hi> on Vice in its Career;
they ſtop it from going its <hi>full</hi> Length; and,
tho' they do not entirely reform the Mind, are
however the Means of preſerving external Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and giving a Check to open Profligateneſs
and Diſſolution of Manners. Men, that are
now <hi>bad,</hi> might probably have been <hi>worſe</hi>
without them; and the World have ſuffered
more from their Licentiouſneſs. Beſides, they
often ſow latent Seeds of Goodneſs in the
Heart, which proper Circumſtances and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ripen; when the Reformation of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
perhaps, is not ſo conſpicuous to the
World, as his former bad Manners have been.
From the <hi>native</hi> Tendency of religious Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
there is Reaſon to believe, that thoſe
good Effects of it are not <hi>ſo rare,</hi> as ſome would
perſuade us; eſpecially, when we conſider it
as accompanied with a <hi>Divine Bleſſing.</hi> By the
Nature and plain Tendency of a Thing, it is
more reaſonable to judge of it, than to lay the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0135602100:17"/>
               <hi>whole</hi> Streſs on Obſervations drawn from a <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi>
Experience, which often is narrow in its
Compaſs, and fallacious in its Concluſions.
One great Cauſe of the Tendency of Religion
being often defeated, certainly is, that the
Knowledge of Divine Things is not thoroughly
imbibed, nor the Belief of them fully received.
Were a juſt Senſe and a firm Perſuaſion of them
more general amongſt Men, we may rationally
hope their good Effects would more extenſively
appear.</p>
            <p>I ADMIT indeed, that mere Knowledge will
prove unavailing againſt the Power of <hi>Temper</hi>
and ſettled <hi>Habits:</hi> Theſe, 'tis ſaid, govern the
Life of Men far more than religious Belief, and
will be too hard for all Principles whatever.
Perhaps this is ſaid with Truth. But then we
ought to conſider, that it is the Nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to work itſelf gradually into the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to acquire the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the Temper,
and ſo to give Riſe to Habits of acting. Hence
the Perfection of religious Influence is, with
great Juſtice and Propriety, deſcribed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by a <hi>new Heart and a new Spirit;</hi> when
the Mind is not involuntarily conſtrained by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0135602100:18"/>
Principle, but Principle forms the inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and becomes, in a Manner, the <hi>ſame</hi>
with Temper and Affection.</p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>actual</hi> Influence of Principle and
Belief on Mankind admits of further Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
from <hi>unconteſted</hi> Matter of Fact. They
who hold the good Influence of Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to be <hi>ſo inconſiderable,</hi> as to render the
Propagation of them of no great Importance,
will be at no Loſs to give us Inſtances of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and wrong Principles having had a <hi>great</hi>
Influence on the World. Loud Complaints
we hear from this Quarter, of the direful <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi>
which <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> have
produced; how they have <hi>poiſoned</hi> the Tempers,
and <hi>tranſformed</hi> the Manners of Men; and
have <hi>overcome</hi> the ſtrongeſt Reſtraints of Law,
of Reaſon and Humanity.—Is this then the
Caſe, that <hi>all</hi> Principles, <hi>except good ones,</hi> are
ſuppoſed to be of ſuch mighty <hi>Energy?</hi> Strange!
that falſe Religion ſhould do <hi>ſo much,</hi> and true
Religion <hi>ſo little.</hi>—No impartial Inquirer,
ſure, can be of ſuch an abſurd Opinion. The
whole Hiſtory of Mankind ſhows, that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Belief is no inconſiderable Principle of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0135602100:19"/>
Action. The Miſchief ſuch Belief has done,
when miſled, is indeed a good Argument to be
on our Guard againſt Error: But, as it is a
Proof of what Belief <hi>can</hi> do, it is an Argument
to hope the more from it, when rightly direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The <hi>ſame</hi> Torrent that overflows and lays
waſte a Country, when put out of its natural
Courſe, enriches the Soil, when it runs in its
proper Bed. If it be alledged, that <hi>Superſtition</hi>
is the more powerful Principle, by falling in
with the weak and corrupt Propenſities of
Mankind; it may be oppoſed to this, that
<hi>Truth</hi> has the Divine Bleſſing, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of Heaven, on its Side. Let us always
hope well of a Cauſe that is good in itſelf, and
beneficial to Mankind. Truth is mighty, and
will prevail. Let us ſpread the <hi>incorruptible
Seed</hi> as widely as we can, and truſt in God, that
<hi>he will give the Increaſe.</hi> So much for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of religious Knowledge to every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual,
in the Way of <hi>Improvement.</hi> Let us
next conſider,</p>
            <p>2. WHAT it promiſes in the Way of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,</hi>
of Aid and Relief to Man, amidſt the
Diſtreſſes of Life. Here it muſt be allowed by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0135602100:20"/>
all, that Religion triumphs; and its valuable
Influence in this Reſpect, muſt be a ſtrong
Argument to every benevolent Mind, for wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Influence to be further ſpread thro'
the World. For, without religious Principle
and Hope, Man is a Creature <hi>miſerable</hi> and
<hi>forlorn.</hi> He finds himſelf here a <hi>Stranger</hi> in a
wide World, where the Powers and Operations
of Nature are very imperfectly known; where
both the Cauſes and the Iſſues of Things are
wrapt up in much Darkneſs; where he is quite
at a Loſs, or at beſt can form only an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Gueſs, whence he comes; for what Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he was brought unto this State of Being;
and whither he is to go, when he departs from
hence. What a <hi>diſconſolate</hi> Situation is this to
a ſerious inquiring Mind! Even tho' it were in
a Man's Power to fill up the Hours of Life
with perpetual Amuſement, void of Care; Life,
enjoyed on ſuch Terms, would, upon Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
appear <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>trifling:</hi> But how much
<hi>worſe,</hi> when we conſider the real Condition of
Man; a Being frail and feeble, beſet with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Dangers and Ills, and expoſed to many a
melancholy Reflection, when he ſees all Things
around him ſo tranſitory and decaying, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0135602100:21"/>
meets with <hi>Diſappointment</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> with
<hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation,</hi> in all the Paths of Life!
In this diſtreſſed Condition, to reveal to him
ſuch Diſcoveries of God, and his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the Chriſtian Religion affords, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
to him a <hi>Father</hi> and a <hi>Friend;</hi> is to let in
a Ray of moſt comforting Light upon the
Darkneſs of human Eſtate. He who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a deſtitute Orphan, wandering in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſpitable
Deſart, has now gained a Shelter
from the bitter and inclement Blaſt. He now
knows to <hi>whom</hi> to pray, and in <hi>whom</hi> to truſt;
<hi>where</hi> to unboſom his Sorrows; from <hi>what</hi>
Hand to look for Relief. Certain it is, that
when the Heart bleeds, from ſome Wound of
recent Miſfortune, there is nothing of equal
Efficacy with religious Comfort. It is of Power
to chear the darkeſt Hours, and to aſſwage the
deepeſt Woe, by the Belief of Divine Favour,
and the Proſpect of happy Immortality. Here
the Mind expatiates with Joy; and, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved
of all its earthly Friends, ſolaces itſelf
with the Thoughts of <hi>One</hi> Friend that will never
forſake it. Theſe Views have a greater and
better Effect on the Heart of a plain, but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> than all the Refinements of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0135602100:22"/>
have on the <hi>Learned.</hi> Refined Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
may pleaſe and amuſe the Mind when it is
at Eaſe; may, perhaps, help to relieve it, when
ſlightly touched with Sorrow; but when it is
torn with any ſore Diſtreſs, they are <hi>cold</hi> and
<hi>feeble,</hi> compared with a direct <hi>Promiſe</hi> from the
Word of God. This is <hi>an Anchor to the Soul
both ſure and ſtedfaſt.</hi> This has given <hi>Refuge and
ſtrong Conſolation</hi> to many a pious and virtuous
Soul, at a Time when mere <hi>Reaſonings</hi> would
have proved utterly unavailing. Beſides, that
they can never be ſo accommodated to the Bulk
of Mankind, as to be <hi>generally</hi> uſeful; this great
Diſadvantage attends them, that they raiſe more
<hi>Perplexities</hi> in an <hi>inquiring</hi> Mind than it is in
their Power to reſolve. Upon the Approach
of <hi>Death,</hi> eſpecially, this will be felt; when, if
a Man thinks at all, his Anxiety muſt naturally
increaſe about the future Concerns of his Soul.
<hi>Then</hi> it is, that the great Importance of the
Diſcoveries of the Goſpel will appear: Not
only <hi>Life and Immortality</hi> brought to Light,
but the Path opened that leads to Life: A <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi>
diſcovered: <hi>Mercy</hi> proclaimed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of the World, thro' this Mediator, to
the Frailties and Errors of thoſe who are peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0135602100:23"/>
humble and ſincere in Heart; and the
<hi>Preſence</hi> of their Redeemer promiſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
them thro' the Valley of the Shadow
of Death, to unſeen Habitations of Reſt and
Glory, where he hath prepared their Place.
Here is Ground for good Men's leaving the
World with <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> But in this
<hi>ſevere</hi> and <hi>trying</hi> Period, this <hi>labouring</hi> Hour
of Nature, how ſhall the wretched Man ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
himſelf, who believes not, or knows not
the Hope of Religion?—Secretly conſcious to
himſelf, that he has not acted the Part he ought,
the Failings and Vices of his paſt Life ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him in ſad Remembrance. He <hi>wiſhes</hi> to
exiſt after Death; and yet is <hi>afraid</hi> of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.
The Governor of the World is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</hi>
His Mercy, for any thing that he can
tell, may be implored <hi>in vain;</hi> all is myſterious
Obſcurity: And in the midſt of endleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities
and Doubts, the trembling Soul is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
away from the Body.—As the Miſfortunes
of Life muſt have been inſupportable to ſuch
a Man, ſo its End is bitter. His ſetting Sun
goes down in a dark Cloud; and the Night
of Death cloſes over his Head, full of Miſery.
<hi>Having no Hope,</hi> and <hi>being without God,</hi> that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0135602100:24"/>
is, without the Knowledge of God <hi>in the World,</hi>
are two Things moſt juſtly connected by the
Apoſtle, when he is deſcribing the Miſery of
the Heathen Nations<note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 12.</note>. Thus, by Means of
<hi>the Knowledge of the Lord,</hi> Man, conſidered as
an <hi>Individual,</hi> is both <hi>improved</hi> and <hi>comforted.</hi>
We are next to ſhow,</p>
            <p n="2">II. WHAT Benefit he receives from this
Knowledge, as a <hi>Member of Society.</hi> This
Branch of the Subject is in Part anticipated, by
what has been already ſaid. For all the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement</hi>
that Man, as an <hi>Individual,</hi> receives
from religious Knowledge, redounds to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the <hi>Publick.</hi> Society reaps the Fruits
of the Virtue of all its Members; and as <hi>each,</hi>
apart, is made better, the <hi>whole</hi> muſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
flouriſh. But, beſides this, religious
Knowledge has a <hi>direct</hi> Tendency to improve
the ſocial Intercourſes of Men, and to aſſiſt
them in co-operating for common Good.</p>
            <p>FOR, firſt of all, it <hi>forms</hi> them for Society.
It <hi>civilizes</hi> Mankind. It tames the Fierceneſs
of their Paſſions, and wears off the Barbarity of
their Manners. Without ſome Notions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0135602100:25"/>
it is much to be queſtioned, whether any
regular Society ever ſubſiſted, or could ſubſiſt,
in the World. All thoſe who, in early Times,
attempted to reduce wandering and ſcattered
Men unto Society, found it neceſſary to begin
with ſome Inſtitution of Religion: And the
wiſeſt Legiſlators of old, thro' the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of their Syſtems of Government, treated
it as neceſſary and eſſential to Civil Polity. If
even thoſe <hi>imperfect</hi> Forms of Religion, mixed
with ſo much Error, were important to Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<hi>how much more,</hi> that reaſonable and true
Worſhip of God which the Goſpel teaches?
True Religion introduces the Idea of regular
Subjection, by accuſtoming Mankind to the
<hi>Awe</hi> of ſuperior Power, in the Deity, <hi>joined</hi>
with the <hi>Eſteem</hi> of ſuperior Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
It is, by its Natnre, an <hi>aſſociating</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
creating new and ſacred Bonds of Union
amongſt Men. Common Aſſemblies for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worſhip, and the joint Veneration of
one God; the Senſe of being all, in common,
dependent on the ſame ſupreme Protection,
and bound by the ſame Ties to Duty, Sharers
of the ſame Benefits of Religion, and Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the ſame Reward; all this has a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0135602100:26"/>
to awaken the Senſe of our friendly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
to knit us together, and ſtrengthen our
mutual Connection.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, religious Knowledge aſſiſts in
preparing the Way for all uſeful and ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Improvements in Society. It has, in Fact,
been found, that, along with the Increaſe of
<hi>religious</hi> Light, <hi>Learning</hi> has flouriſhed, and
uſeful <hi>Arts</hi> have been cultivated and advanced.
The true Knowledge of the Lord promotes a
<hi>free</hi> and <hi>manly</hi> Spirit. It teaches Men to think
for themſelves, to form their Principles upon a
a fair Inquiry unto the Word of God; and not
to reſign their Conſciences implicitely to Men.
Hence, it is ſtrongly connected with a Deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Oppreſſion of every kind; and forms a
Taſte for <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Laws.</hi> We ſee that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Governments have taken the firmeſt
Root, in Nations blinded by <hi>Mahometan</hi> and
<hi>Pagan</hi> Darkneſs, where the Throne of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is <hi>ſupported</hi> by Ignorance and Error. In
the Chriſtian World, as long as <hi>Popiſh</hi> Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
reigned undiſturbed, <hi>Darkneſs, Oppreſſion</hi>
and <hi>Slavery</hi> were in its Train. For ſome Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies,
the Cloud ſat <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>deep</hi> over all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0135602100:27"/>
and threatned a Relapſe unto ancient Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity:
Till, at the auſpicious Aera of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
together with the true <hi>Knowledge of
the Lord, Learning, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> began
to ſhine forth, and reſume their Luſtre. At
this Day, the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> is, in our own,
and ſome other States, the great Bulwark of
<hi>Liberty.</hi> The Promoters of arbitrary Power
know this well; and hence, it has been their
conſtant Aim to bear it down; and in place of
the <hi>Knowledge of the Lord,</hi> to eſtabliſh an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit</hi>
Submiſſion to the Dictates of <hi>Men,</hi> in
Matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>BUT this is not the whole of that happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
which religious Knowledge hath on
Society. It is not only ſubſidiary to its <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,</hi>
but neceſſary to its <hi>Preſervation.</hi>
It is the very <hi>Baſis</hi> on which it reſts. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Principle is what gives Mankind the
ſureſt Hold of one another. That laſt and
greateſt Pledge of Veracity, an <hi>Oath,</hi> without
which no Society can ſubſiſt, derives its whole
Authority from the Reverence of God, to
whom it is a ſolemn Appeal. Baniſh religious
Principle, and you looſen all the Bonds of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0135602100:28"/>
You ſhake the fundamental Pillar of all
mutual Truſt and Confidence amongſt Men;
nay, you deſtroy the Security ariſing from
<hi>Laws</hi> themſelves. For human Laws and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Sanctions cannot extend to numberleſs
Caſes, in which the Safety of Mankind is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned. They would be very ineffectual
Means of maintaining the Order and Peace of
Society, if there were no Checks upon Men,
from the Senſe of Divine Legiſlation; if no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of Divine Rewards and Puniſhments were
to come in Aid, of what human Rewards and
Puniſhments ſo imperfectly provide for.</p>
            <p>INDEED, the Belief of Religion is of ſuch
Importance to publick Welfare, that the moſt
expreſſive Deſcription we could give of a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
in the utmoſt Circumſtances of Diſorder,
would be to ſay, There was no <hi>Fear of God</hi>
left amongſt them.—Our Imagination would
immediately conceive of them as looſe and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;
abandoned to Rapine and Violence, to
Perfidy and Treachery; deceiving and deceived;
oppreſſing and oppreſt; conſumed by inteſtine
Broils, and ripe for becoming a Prey to the firſt
Invader.—On the other hand, in order to any
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0135602100:29"/>
Society's flouriſhing in its higheſt <hi>Perfection</hi>
and <hi>Glory,</hi> we need only ſuppoſe the Belief of
Chriſtian Principles prevailing in ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as to exert their <hi>entire</hi> Influence on the
Hearts and Lives of all its Members. <hi>Then</hi>
would the moſt amiable Scene open. We would
ſee the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of publick Diſunion inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
when Men were once formed to the
Purſuit of thoſe higher Intereſts, which give
no Occaſion to <hi>Competitions</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies;</hi> and
warmed in Heart with that noble Spirit of <hi>Love</hi>
which our holy Religion breathes; and of
which it hath ſet before us ſuch illuſtrious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
in Almighty God, and our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
We would ſee the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith ſhedding over Families, Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
and Communities; the comfortable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of Unity and Peace, like the <hi>Dew of
Hermon, and the Dew that deſcendeth upon the
Mountains of Zion, where the Lord commandeth
the Bleſſing, even Life for evermore</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. cxxxiii. 3.</note>. We
would ſee them inſpiring private Faith and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Loyalty; reſtoring Sobriety of Manners
and Simplicity of Life; promoting in every
Man Contentment with his Lot, Reſignation
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0135602100:30"/>
to Divine Appointment, continual Regard to
the Bleſſing of Heaven.—We may extol <hi>Riches</hi>
and <hi>Traffick;</hi> but, in Truth, the Prevalency
of ſuch Principles of publick <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi>
forms the real <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of a
Nation. In Proportion as theſe prevail, they
give us the Proſpect of human Society riſing
from that ſad <hi>Degeneracy</hi> into which it is at
preſent ſunk, and advancing, under the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Heaven, towards that happy Period,
when <hi>Nation ſhall not lift up their Sword againſt
Nation, nor War be learned any more</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. ii. 4.</note>; <hi>when
there ſhall be nothing to hurt nor deſtroy in all
the holy Mountain of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To convince us yet further of the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of religious Knowledge to the Welfare
of Society, there is one Conſideration which
deſerves particular Attention. It is this; That
if <hi>good Seed</hi> be not ſown in the Field, <hi>Tares</hi>
will infallibly ariſe. There is a ſtrong <hi>Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
in human Nature to Religion: A natural
Preparation of the Mind for receiving ſome
Impreſſions of religious Belief. In ignorant
and uncultivated Minds, <hi>Superſtition</hi> or <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0135602100:31"/>
never fail to graft themſelves upon this
Root. Into what monſtrous Forms <hi>theſe</hi> have
ſhot forth, and what various Miſchiefs they
have produced in Society, is too well known.
But this is not the <hi>whole</hi> of the Danger. For
deſigning Men are ſeldom wanting to take <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi>
of popular Weakneſs; and to <hi>improve</hi>
a ſuperſtitious Biaſs to their own ambitious and
intereſted <hi>Ends.</hi> Hence Superſtition, in itſelf
a formidable Evil, threatens Conſequences ſtill
more formidable, when it is made the <hi>Tool</hi> of
Ambition and Intereſt. In this Way <hi>Popery</hi>
has become the Means of enſlaving the People,
and exalting the Church to exorbitant Power;
and, like ſome baneful Planet, has ſhed moſt
malignant Influences both on the civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Intereſts of Chriſtian Society.</p>
            <p>As it is the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of true Religion which
gives Riſe to thoſe Evils, this furniſhes us with
one ſtrong Argument, for promoting the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it in the World; that juſt and rational
Principles of Religion may fill up the <hi>Room</hi> in
Mens Minds, which Superſtition will otherwiſe
uſurp; and the Enemies of Society will make
their Advantage of. This brings the Caſe near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0135602100:32"/>
to ourſelves, by ſuggeſting to us the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Part of our own Country, upon
which the <hi>Society for propagating Chriſtian
Knowledge</hi> have chiefly beſtowed their Care.
A Part of the Country, which may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as yet <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>uncivilized;</hi> where Society
has ſcarcely got beyond its <hi>Infant</hi> State; and
whither the Influence of Government and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
has very imperfectly reached: Where the
Inhabitants, hitherto accuſtomed to no Subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
except a ſlaviſh Dependence on their Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
are inured to Rapine, totally negligent of
the Arts of Peace, and Strangers to cultivated
Life: Where the groſſeſt <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition</hi>
have remarkably reigned, and have
nouriſhed, as their <hi>proper</hi> Offſpring, a blind At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
to ſome pernicious Notions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
artfully inſtilled into their Minds.
If ever the Aid of religious Knowledge was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to eſtabliſh and aſſiſt Society, it muſt
be allowed to be neceſſary here: Eſpecially, as
we know Popiſh Emiſſaries have not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among them, to ſow their <hi>poiſonous</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
and to foment that <hi>diſaffected</hi> Spirit, the
violent Effects of which were felt a few Years
ago; when we ſaw them ruſhing, like a Torrent
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0135602100:33"/>
from their own bleak Mountains, to ſpread
Confuſion and Terror through a peaceful
Land.—If ſo many of our Countrymen have
hitherto been not only <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> but even <hi>danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
to the reſt of the Society, ought not <hi>all</hi> wiſe
and good Men to encourage the Deſign of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
among them thoſe Principles of true
religious Knowledge, which may <hi>reform</hi> them
from Barbarity, and <hi>unite</hi> them to the reſt of
the Society? Regard to our own Safety and
Tranquility might alone recommend this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
tho' no <hi>higher</hi> Motive were applied to.
The Method, that is employed in carrying it
on, muſt be allowed to be inconteſtably proper;
the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Schools</hi> for the religious
Education of Youth, who muſt otherwiſe have
been void of all moral Culture, and of Courſe
have been the prepared Inſtruments of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Cruelty. The good Deſigns of the
<hi>Legiſlature</hi> for introducing regular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Induſtry and Arts, into thoſe Parts of the
Country, can never be purſued with Succeſs, if
Endeavours be not <hi>early</hi> uſed, to root out bad
Principles, both of Religion and Government,
from their Minds, and to plant right ones in
their ſtead. The more directly to co-operate
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0135602100:34"/>
with the Legiſlature for <hi>civil</hi> Good, the <hi>Society</hi>
have not confined themſelves to the Care of
<hi>religious</hi> Education; but make it their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to baniſh <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> and to inſtruct Youth
in <hi>ſuch Arts</hi> as may qualify them to be uſeful
Members of Civil Society<note n="†" place="bottom">The Society are authoriſed, by a ſecond Patent obtained from the Crown, in the Year 1738, to <hi>cauſe ſuch of the Children as they ſhall think fit, to be inſtructed and bred up to Huſbandry, Trades and Manufactures, or to ſuch other manual Operations as the Society ſhall think proper.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>THESE Conſiderations directly reſpect the
Good of Society. But, when we take the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that has been treated, in its <hi>full</hi> Extent;
when we conſider the Importance of religious

and their Preparation for <hi>future</hi> Glory, the
Motive for ſpreading that Knowledge through
the World receives a great Addition of Strength.
Is it not an affecting Thought, that there ſhould
be ſo many of our Fellow-creatures, nay of
our Countrymen, deſtitute of all thoſe Bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

Him, <hi>whom to know is Life eternal</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">John xvii. 3.</note>. Such
a Deſign calls upon every <hi>Lover of Mankind</hi>
for Encouragement and Support. As it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
from <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>benevolent</hi> Views, by
the <hi>Society</hi> erected for this Purpoſe amongſt
ourſelves, ſo, by the <hi>Progreſs</hi> they have made,

in our <hi>American</hi> Colonies, not without Succeſs.
In an Undertaking of this Nature, where the
Field is ſo wide, and where ſo much yet remains
to be done, the charitable Aſſiſtance of all is
moſt neceſſary. Thoſe eſpecially who are <hi>rich
in this World</hi> have here an Opportunity put
into their Hands by Providence of employing,

            </p>
            <p>I muſt mention one Conſideration more,
which render theſe Aſſociations of good Men,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0135602100:37"/>
to promote Chriſtian Knowledge, the <hi>more</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,
and the <hi>more</hi> deſerving of our Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
at this Day. They are not only the
Means of extending Chriſtianity <hi>further</hi> than
it has already reached, but likewiſe of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Regard for it <hi>at Home.</hi> They preſerve,
at leaſt, the <hi>Face of Seriouſneſs</hi> amongſt us, and
contribute to recall ſomething of that <hi>Zeal</hi> which
has ſo much decayed. This renders them pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<hi>ſeaſonable</hi> now, when a Horror at <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition</hi>

to the Dangers of <hi>Irreligion,</hi> and of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference</hi>
about all that is ſacred: Tho' this <hi>laſt</hi>
is certainly much more the general Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtick

we have any Regard for the moſt valuable

            <head>STATE
OF THE
SOCIETY in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
FOR
Propagating CHRISTIAN KNOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDGE,
in the Year 1750.</head>
            <p>THIS SOCIETY took its Riſe about the
Year 1700; and, in the Year 1709, was
erected into a Body corporate, by Letters pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
from her late Majeſty Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> The
Intention was to promote the Knowledge of
Chriſtianity thro' the remote Corners of the
Highlands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> miſerably ſunk in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and in Ignorance; a Deſign, which every
one muſt acknowledge laudable, and worthy of
Encouragement.</p>
            <p>THIS Encouragement it met from many
pious and well-diſpoſed Perſons, who, from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0135602100:40"/>
time to time, did, and do ſtill contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
its Support, by charitable Donations, in
ſo much, that at preſent the Society finds itſelf
in Condition to maintain no fewer than 136
Schools, at which are educated to the Number
of 7000 Children of both Sexes.</p>
            <p>THE Directors uſe the Word <hi>educate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that comes up beſt to the Deſign of the
Society, which is, to inſtruct the Children, firſt
of all, in the Knowledge of Chriſtianity, the
reformed Proteſtant Religion. 2<hi>dly,</hi> In Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Orthography, Arithmetick and Church
Muſick. 3<hi>dly,</hi> In the Knowledge of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Tongue, and, if poſſible, to root out the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> altogether. And, <hi>laſtly,</hi> To teach them
right Principles of Government, to inſtil a
Love of true Liberty and Affection to King
<hi>George.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH this Deſign did the Society ſet out,
with this Deſign does it ſtill go on, and in this
Deſign it has, in ſome Meaſure, happily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded;
ſo that, from the Beginning of its E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
until now, (at the moſt moderate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation)
it has been the Means of inſtructing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0135602100:41"/>
50,000 Children, of both Sexes, in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Chriſtianity. The firſt Step to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Religion into the Heart, is to diſpel the
Clouds of Ignorance in the Head.—The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
can do no more than Men can do; they
may endeavour to convey Knowledge into the
Head, but it is the Office of the ſupreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bring it home to the Heart.</p>
            <p>AND, ſure, the Means which this Society
uſes are of all others the moſt proper. They
are applied to the Minds of the Inhabitants,
when theſe Minds and theſe inhabitants are
young, and their Tempers, like the Willow,
are more eaſily bent any Way.—If they cannot
ſucceed at this Age, they never will at any;
and it is believed, that if this Method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the Highlands of <hi>Scotland</hi> proves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortive,
all other human Methods certainly will.</p>
            <p>SURE then, it cannot but be the Duty, and
muſt be the Intereſt of every good Man, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>Briton,</hi> to encourage this Deſign;—tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo evidently to make us a happy,—a
free,—and an united Nation.—Religion and
Liberty, and Induſtry and Joy, are Siſters, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0135602100:42"/>
never appear to ſuch Advantage, as in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
with one another.—While Superſtition and
Slavery, and Idleneſs and Sulleneſs, are Spectres
the moſt hideous, and ought to have their
Dwelling not upon the Earth, but under it.</p>
            <p>THE Society obtained a new Patent in the
Year 1738, enabling them to inſtruct the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
under their Care, in the Knowledge of
Huſbandry and Houſewifery, Trade and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture,
or in ſuch like manual Operations.
This they have already done in ſeveral remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Inſtances, and are deſireous to do ſo in
more, as their Stock enables them. And they
apply the Benefactions made, either to the
Purpoſes of the firſt, or of the ſecond Charter,
as the Donor is pleaſed to direct; ſo that now,
Religion and Induſtry go Hand in Hand,
ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh one another.</p>
            <p>AMONG the various Inſtances of Generoſity
which the Year 1749 has produced, the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
judge themſelves bound to take particular
Notice of the two following, both from one
Country, that of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The one is the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentleman of Diſtinction,
who has not only paid into the Society 100 <hi>l.</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0135602100:43"/> 
               <hi>Sterl.</hi> towards the Support of Charity Schools
in the Iſlands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but alſo cauſed
tranſlate Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Call to the Unconverted,</hi>
&amp;c. into the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Language, (for the Uſe of
ſuch as cannot learn <hi>Engliſh</hi>) under Direction
of this Society, and has given a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Sum, and engaged to pay what further
may be neceſſary for defraying the Expence of
it.—The Work is now finiſhed, by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of a Reverend Member of the Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and will be printed without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
and diſtributed at the Sight of the Society.</p>
            <p>THE other is a Legacy, which the Society
has received from Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> Surgeon in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
for no leſs than 100 <hi>l. Sterl.</hi>—of which
they have now actually got Payment.—Two
Inſtances worthy to be imitated by all, (where
Circumſtances will allow) who hope for that
melting Acknowledgement of the Saviour of
Sinners: <hi>In as much as ye have done thoſe Things
to one of the leaſt of my Brethren, ye have done
them unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES thoſe Endeavours uſed by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
to promote the Knowledge of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
at home, they have alſo in Conformity
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0135602100:44"/>
to a Clauſe in their firſt Patent, extended their
Care to Places abroad, particularly to the wild
and wandering <hi>Indians</hi> on the Borders of <hi>New
York, New Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Penſilvania.</hi> The firſt
Attempt of this Kind was made in the Year
1731, and another and more ſucceſsful one in
the Year 1741 and 1747. Of the Succeſs of
this laſt Miſſion the World has had a printed
Account (under the Care of Dr. <hi>Doddridge</hi>)

are grown extremely deſirous of reading and
underſtanding the Word of God;—For that
End, ſays he, they attend an Evening School,
which the Schoolmaſter has ſet up on Purpoſe.—The greater Part of the young People attend
this School alſo, and ſome that are 40 or 50
Years of Age; and it is hoped, that moſt of
them will, in a little Time, be able to read the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0135602100:46"/>
Bible. The School is increaſing, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
make good Progreſs in their Learning.</p>
            <p>As to the College propoſed to be erected in
<hi>New Jersey,</hi> the Society have done every Thing
in their Power to encourage it, and have ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the Sum of 30 <hi>l. Sterl.</hi> to be employed in
buying proper Books for the Students; ſo that,
in a little Time, there is reaſon to hope, that
there will be no more Reaſon for a Complaint,
ſo often made in theſe Parts, That <hi>the Harveſt
is great, but the Labourers are few.</hi>—Neither
can the Directors omit taking this Opportunity
of recommending this good Deſign to others.
The Thing indeed recommends itſelf, and muſt
do ſo to every Perſon, whoſe Heart is capable
of the leaſt Tincture of Compaſſion for ſuch
vaſt Numbers of poor forlorn <hi>Indians.</hi>—Nor
would ſuch a Seminary anſwer a religious End
only, it would alſo ſerve a political View; for
ſure, if from us Learning and good Manners
could be propagated thro' theſe Savages, it
would be a Mean of engaging them more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt. And if, along with
Learning and good Manners, true Religion
ſhould take place among them, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0135602100:47"/>
come Subjects, willing Subjects of the KING
of all Kings, what Joy would not this yield to
every ſincere Chriſtian?</p>
            <p>BY this Means, Streams would break out
in that vaſt Wilderneſs, and Rivers run in that
immenſe Deſart.—Nay, the Deſart would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
and bloſſom as the Roſe; ſo that from the
Riſing of the Sun unto where he goeth down,
a pure Offering ſhould be offered unto the true
God.—Men ſhould be bleſſed in Jeſus, and all
Nations call him Bleſſed.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Prayers of this Society, and
they are the Prayers of every true Chriſtian.</p>
