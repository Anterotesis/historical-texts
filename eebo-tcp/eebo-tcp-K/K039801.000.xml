            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To you, and your courtly Tribe of Imitators, we ſtand indebted for the frequent, curious Amendments of FASHION, and Machinations of LOVE; alſo for OPERAS, BURLETTAS, MAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUERADES, PANTOMIMES, DRUMS, ROUTS, with a long &amp;c. of <hi>Time-killing</hi> Amuſements; and laſt, <hi>though not leaſt in Love,</hi> for the following Tale founded on your Syſtems of Life, which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance muſt particularly recommend it to your moſt indulgent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage.</p>

            <p>KNOWING from perſonal Experience how apt prefatory Matter is to pall, I ſhall no farther intrude upon the Leiſure of my Readers than briefly to obſerve, that the following Narration is founded on Truth; that it is related, excluſive of an Alteration in the Cataſtrophe of <hi>NARCISSA,</hi> with ſtrict Fidelity. What Merit there may be in it, I ſhall leave the Public to decide; I am well apprized that the Characters will ſeem ſomewhat imperfect, particularly <hi>ELIZA,</hi> who does not appear ſufficiently to conſtitute a Principal; but I hope to be excuſed any Error of this Kind, though voluntary, as I found Prolixity ſtealing in upon me, which I was reſolved at any Rate to avoid.</p>
            <p>I ſhould perhaps have thrown the Incidents together in Proſe, but that I think the Town already too much harraſſed with <hi>MEMOIRS, ADVEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURES,</hi> &amp;c. This is a Sort of Deviation, and I hope ſome Perſons of ſtronger Genius than I imagine myſelf to be will communicate Pictures of Life in poetical Narratives.</p>
            <p>Upon the Whole, as I know many Faults muſt appear, I earneſtly requeſt that every judicious Reader will make ſuch Amendments as ſeem neceſſary, and render it, if poſſible, agreeable to his or her Taſte, believing I ſhould have done the ſame, had it been in my Power.</p>
