            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN time of ſecurity, when proſperity ſmiles upon the land, the eloquence of an angel would not be attended to; but, when Princes, to become ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign maſters, trample under foot, without ſhame or remorſe, the moſt ſacred rights of the people, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is excited by the moſt minute object, and even the voice of a man ſo unſupported as myſelf may have effect upon the minds of the public.</p>
            <p>If by collecting into one point of view under your eyes the villainous meaſures planned by Princes to attain abſolute empire, and the diſmal ſcenes ever attendant on deſpotiſm, I could inſpire you with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror againſt tyranny, and revive in your breaſts the holy flame of liberty which burnt in thoſe of your forefathers, I ſhould eſteem myſelf the moſt happy of men.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, the preſent parliament, by law, muſt ſoon expire; and no diſſolution was ever more earneſtly
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0044000700:4"/>wiſhed for by an injured people. Your moſt ſacred rights have been flagrantly violated by your repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, your remonſtrances to the throne artfully rejected, yourſelves treated like a handful of diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſons, and your complaints ſilenced by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the ſame conduct which raiſed them. Such is your condition, and if ſuch it continues, the little liberty which is yet left you, muſt ſoon be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed: but the time for redreſs is now approaching, and it is in your power to obtain that juſtice you have ſo many times craved in vain.</p>
            <p>As long as virtue reigns in the great council of the nation, the prerogative of the crown, and the rights of the ſubjects, are ſo tempered that they mutually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and reſtrain each other: but when honour and virtue are wanting in the ſenate, the balance is deſtroyed: the parliament, the ſtrength and glory of Britain, becomes a profligate faction, which, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the miniſter's bounty, and ſeeking to ſhare with him the ſpoils of their country, joins thoſe at the helm in their criminal deſigns, and ſupports their deſtructive meaſures,—a band of diſguiſed traitors, who, under the name of guardians, traffic away the national intereſts, and the rights of a free-born people: the Prince then becomes abſolute, and the people ſlaves.
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0044000700:5"/>—A truth of which we have unfortunately had but too often the ſad experience.</p>
            <p>On you alone, Gentlemen, depends the care of ſecuring the freedom of parliament; and it is ſtill in your power to revive that auguſt aſſembly, which, in the laſt century, humbled the pride of a tyrant, and broke your fetters: but to effect this, how careful muſt you be in your choice of thoſe into whoſe hands you ſhall truſt your authority?</p>
            <p>Reject boldly all who attempt to buy your votes; they are but mercenary ſuitors, who covet only to enlarge their fortune at the expence of their honour, and the intereſt of their country.</p>
            <p>Reject all who have any place at court, any employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the diſpoſal of the great officers of the crown, any commiſſion which the King can improve. By men thus dependant, and of which the ſenate is chiefly compoſed at preſent, how can you hope to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with fidelity?</p>
            <p>Reject all who earneſtly mendicate your voice; there is no good to be expected from that quarter. If they had nothing at heart but the honour of ſerving the public, do you imagine that they would ſubmit to act ſuch a diſgraceful part? Thoſe humiliating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues are the tranſactions of vice, not of virtue.
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0044000700:6"/>Merit indeed is fond of honourable diſtinctions; yet ſatisfied with proving worthy of them, it never debaſes itſelf to beg them, but waits till they are offered.</p>
            <p>Reject men of pompous titles; among them there is little knowledge and leſs virtue: nay, what have they of nobility but the name, the luxuries and the vices of it?</p>
            <p>Reject the inſolent opulent; in this claſs are not to be found the few virtues which are left to ſtock the nation.</p>
            <p>Reject young men; no confidence is to be placed in them. Wholly given up to pleaſure in this age of degeneracy; diſſipation, amuſements, and debauchery, are their only occupation; and, to ſupport the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive gaieties of the capital, they are ever ready to act with zeal in the intereſts of a miniſter. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them not corrupt, they are but little acquainted with the national intereſt; beſides, naturally incapable of long continued attention, they are impatient of reſtraint, they would have nothing to do, but to give their votes, and cannot attend to what they call the dry buſineſs of the houſe, and fulfil the duties of a good ſenator.</p>
            <p>Select for your repreſentatives men diſtinguiſhed by their ability, integrity, and love for their country;
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0044000700:7"/>men verſed in the national affairs, men whom an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent fortune ſecures from the temptations of poverty, and a diſdain of ruinous pageantry from the allurements of ambition; men who have not been corrupted by the ſmiles of a court, men whoſe venerable mature age crowns a ſpotleſs life; men who have ever appeared zealous for the public cauſe, and have had in view only the welfare of their country, and the obſervance of the laws.</p>
            <p>Confine not your choice to the candidates who offer themſelves; invite men worthy of that truſt, wiſe men who deſire to be your repreſentatives, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſpute that honour with the rich without merit, who labour by bribes to force it out of your hands; do it in ſuch a manner, that for the pleaſure of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their country, they ſhall have no occaſion to dread the ruin of their fortune; and ſcorn even to eat or drink at proſtituted tables.</p>
            <p>The utmoſt efforts will be exerted, as uſual, by the miniſtry to influence your choice. Are the alluring baits of corruption to triumph over your virtue? Is the Britiſh ſpirit ſo ſunk that none durſt ſcorn to receive a bribe? When your great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt ought to direct you, ſhall the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh paſſions dare to raiſe their voice? Are they worthy to be indulged at ſuch a price? Behold the
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0044000700:8"/>diſmal ſcenes ariſing from neglect of national intereſt; behold your ſenators buſy in making, altering, and amending acts for ſecuring the property of their dogs, whilſt half of the ſubjects, lingering in miſery from the villainy of monopolizers, cry to them for bread; behold your country bleeding at the feet of a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the wounds ſhe has received.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, the whole nation caſt their eyes upon you for redreſs; but if your heart be ſhut to generous feelings, and juſtice to your fellow ſubjects cannot move you, let your own intereſt at leaſt animate you.</p>
            <p>To you is left a power to ſecure the liberty of the people, or enſlave the nation; during the time you proceed to election you are, it may be termed, the arbiters of the ſtate, and can teach thoſe to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before you, who would make you tremble before them. Be made ſenſible of the importance of your functions; let honour raiſe its voice, and a becoming pride elevate your minds. How can the dignity of your office be united with the infamy of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption?</p>
            <p>Moſt of the candidates are laviſh of fawning careſſes, and ſpare no baſeneſs to gain you to their intereſts, but look upon you with diſdain, from the inſtant they have extorted your votes. Reſent ſuch affront, reject their hypocritical courteſy, think on the inſolent
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0044000700:9"/>contempt which follows, and fix your choice upon men who are conſcious of what they owe to their conſtituents.</p>
            <p>Parliament under undue influence will do no act to promote the public welfare: Nay, thoſe who have carried their election with money, not ſatisfied with neglecting your intereſt, treat you as a mercenary gang of ſlaves; eagerly ſeeking to be repaid any way, they traffic away your rights, and uſe the power you have truſted them with, to ruin you. Are the baits of corruption ſo attractive as not to be counterbalanced by the ſolid advantages tendered by virtue? But what are the bribes taken for votes, to the loſſes ſuffered by a neglect of your intereſts, to the advantages you would reap from being repreſented with ability and fidelity?</p>
            <p>Beſides what you owe to your country and your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, conſider what you owe to poſterity.</p>
            <p>How careful were your anceſtors, although with hazard of their lives, to tranſmit thoſe rights as entire to their children as they had received them from their fathers. What they did with labour, you may do with eaſe; what they did with danger, you may do with ſafety. Will the holy flame of liberty which burnt in their breaſts never burn in yours? Will you
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0044000700:10"/>diſgrace the names of your forefathers? Will you not ſhudder with horror at the idea of injuring your poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity? Is the age of liberty paſſed away? Shall your children, bathing their chains with tears, one day ſay, —Theſe are the fruits of the venality of our fathers?</p>
            <p>Gentlemen,</p>
            <p>With virtue and courage a people may ever main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their liberty: but when once this ineſtimable treaſure is loſt, it is almoſt impoſſible to recover it; and it is very near being ſo, when electors ſet a price on their votes.</p>

            <head>THE CHAINS OF SLAVERY.</head>
            <p>IT appears the common lot of mankind not to be allowed the enjoyment of liberty: Princes every where are aſpiring to deſpotiſm, and the people ſinking to ſervitude.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtory of Deſpotiſm is replete with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common events: On one ſide, we ſurvey the bold deſigns of ſome ambitious men, their villainous attempts, and the ſecret ſprings they put in action to attain illicit power: on the other ſide, we ſee the people, whilſt repoſing under the ſhade of their own laws, enſlaved; we behold the vain efforts of an unfortunate multitude to ſhake off oppreſſion, and the numberleſs evils conſtantly attendants on ſlavery. Scenes at once horrible and magnificent, wherein alternately appear peace, plenty, ſports, pomp,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0044000700:16"/>feſtivals, diſſentions, miſery, artifice, treachery, treaſon, baniſhments, conteſts and carnage.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Deſpotiſm is eſtabliſhed at once by the force of arms: but this rapid progreſs of power to abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Empire is not the ſubject of my preſent work: it is the ſlow and gradual efforts of policy, which by degrees ſubject the necks of the people to the yoke, depriving them at the ſame time both of the means and deſire of ſhaking it off.</p>
            <p>From attentively conſidering the eſtabliſhment of deſpotiſm, it is evident that Slavery is only the effect of time, and the neceſſary conſequence of the defects of political conſtitutions. Let us endeavour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to diſcover how by their means the Magiſtrate uſurps the title of Maſter, and ſubſtitutes his will for the law. Let us review that multiplicity of machines, which the ſacrilegious audacity of Princes has recourſe to, in order to ſap the foundation of liberty: let us follow their dark projects, their crafty proceedings, their ſecret plots, enter into a detail of their fatal policy, unfold the principles of that deceitful art, and reduce to one point of view the various attacks that have been made upon Public Freedom. But in arranging my obſervations, I ſhall leſs regard the order of time than the connection of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0044000700:17"/>When once the dangerous truſt of public authority is committed to a Prince, and the care of enforcing obedience to the laws to Magiſtrates, the people ſee themſelves ſooner or later ſubdued by thoſe rulers they have made choice of, and their liberty, their property, their lives at the diſcretion of thoſe who have been appointed to protect them. No ſooner has the Prince caſt his eyes upon the truſt repoſed on him, but he endeavours to forget from what hands he received it: Full of himſelf and of his power, he ſupports impatiently the idea of his dependance, and conſtantly labours to free himſelf from every ſort of reſtraint.</p>
            <p>The people are never voluntary ſlaves, they yield not to power, but when they believe it to be a duty, or are unable to oppoſe it. Hence in a ſtate newly founded or reformed, the ſubjects are not at once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved, however imperfect the conſtitution might be. Deſpair, that prompted them at firſt to throw off the yoke, would prompt them to throw it off anew when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhould feel its weight. To commence with open attacks upon liberty, and to attempt to deſtroy it by violence, would prove therefore a raſh under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. When thoſe who govern, daringly diſpute the ſupreme power with open force, and the people
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0044000700:18"/>perceive their rulers attempting<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>If we properly attend, we ſhall find, that no State is in its origin of great extent, and that all owe their increaſe to no other cauſe but conqueſt or alliance.</p>
               </note> to enſlave them, the latter ever prevail, and the Prince in a moment loſes the fruit of all his efforts. At his firſt attempt the ſubjects unite againſt him, and his authority is at ſtake, if his conduct be not more ſubmiſſive than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious. It is not therefore by open attacks Princes firſt attempt to enſlave the people, they take their meaſures in ſecreſy, they have recourſe to craft: it is by ſlow but conſtant efforts, by changes almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible, by innovations of which it is difficult to obſerve the conſequences, and ſuch as are ſcarcely taken notice of.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Power of Time.</head>
               <p>THE firſt attack Princes make upon the public liberty, is not the violating audaciouſly the laws, but the cauſing them to fall into oblivion. To enchain their ſubjects, they begin by ſetting them aſleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0044000700:19"/>Whilſt men have their heads heated with ideas of liberty, and whilſt the bloody image of Tyranny is ſtill before their eyes, they deteſt deſpotiſm, and watch with inquietude every motion of the Miniſtry. The Prince at that time is cautious not to form any attacks upon public freedom; he appears the father of his people, and his reign the aera of juſtice. At firſt his adminiſtration is ſo mildly conducted, that it might be apprehended he has a deſign of extending Liberty, far from having any intent of ruining it.</p>
               <p>Having nothing to diſpute relating to their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, which are not conteſted, nor to their liberty which is not attacked, the people gradually become leſs watchful over the conduct of their rulers, they inſenſibly diſcontinue to be upon their guard, and finally lay aſide all ſolicitude, reſting tranquil beneath the ſhade of the laws.</p>
               <p>Thus in proportion as the people recede from the ſtormy times, in which the conſtitution took its riſe; they gradually loſe ſight of Liberty. To ſet their minds at reſt, there is occaſion only to let things proceed in their natural order. But Princes do not always rely on the power of time alone.</p>

               <p>TO the power of time and influence of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, is joined an attention to national affairs. Some war<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>Charlemagne continually engaged his nobility in different expeditions, and by obliging them thus to concur in his deſigns, he never gave them time to examine into his conduct.</p>

                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0044000700:21"/>Ferdinand of Arragon made uſe of this artifice during almoſt his whole reign. Firſt he attacked Granada, next expelled the Moors from his dominions, he then carried the war into Africa, Italy, France; and by theſe continual enterprizes, entirely engaged the unquiet buſy minds of his ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>"We command, ſaid Charles V. to Francis I. people of ſuch fierce and reſtleſs diſpoſitions, that unleſs we were engaged in frequent wars in order to amuſe them, our ſubjects would not indure us." Matthieu, Hiſt. de la. Paix, lib. i. narrat. xi.</p>

The multitude, judging from appearances alone, believe the Prince is attentive to the welfare of the ſtate only, whilſt he is wholly taken up with his projects; they grow careleſs more and more, and at laſt they ceaſe to be watchful over their enemy.</p>
               <p>While the minds of the people ceaſe to be engaged, the defects of the conſtitution begin to unfold: the Prince, ever intent upon his own intereſts, is ſeeking means to extend his power; but now takes care not to give the leaſt room for diſturbing that profound ſecurity.</p>

               <p>AMUSING the people is not ſufficient, the prince endeavours to have them well affected towards him: and what ſome do to divert the attention of their ſubjects, others do to gain their affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0044000700:22"/>The Roman people, thoſe abſolute maſters of the earth, were extremely fond of public ſhows; and the magnificence of entertainments was a mean made uſe of, to captivate them, by thoſe who deprived them of their power and liberty.</p>
               <p>When Charles II. aſcended the throne of Spain, the firſt buſineſs of the miniſter was to reſtore plenty to the kingdom, and to indulge the people with ſhows; never in that country were ſeen ſo many bull-fights, plays, and other entertainments after the taſte of the nation<note n="*" place="bottom">Deſormeaux, Abreg. Chronol. de l'Hiſt. d'Eſpag.</note>.</p>
               <p>To conciliate the affections of the people, princes have recourſe ſometimes to grants, &amp;c.<note n="†" place="bottom">It muſt be confeſſed, that this crafty wile ſucceeds but too well with the multitude—a ſtupid animal whoſe affection largeſſes ever ſecure. Whilſt from a balcony of the Hotel de ville, Mazarine, on his return to Paris, ſcattered money among the rabble, it was curious to hear the people paſſing from the greateſt imprecations to the greateſt enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums.

               <p>Louis XIV. applied himſelf to win the hearts of his ſubjects, by his engaging manners, his prodigality and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0044000700:23"/>magnificence. He was careful no one ſhould depart diſſatisfied from his preſence, he ſecured by lucrative employments thoſe whom he ſuſpected, and by favours gained to himſelf even the inſatiate croud of courtiers. At court, he amuſed the people with feaſts, fireworks, balls, maſquerades, tournaments, ſhews of every kind. In his campaigns, he repeated the feaſts, he viſited in his wonted pageantry the towns that had ſubmitted to his power; he invited to his table women of quality, conferred gratifications on the military, ſcattered gold among the populace, and was applauded to the ſkies. But it is not by grants only<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Every grant of the Prince to the people ought to be ſuſpected, unleſs conferred at the time of any ſudden calamity. The only method a Prince, who has no deſigns upon liberty, can make uſe of to relieve his people, is the leſſening of their taxes.</p>

               <p>Ferdinand VI. on aſcending the throne, endeavoured to gain popularity by apparent airs of goodneſs: he ordered the priſons to be opened to all who had been committed for no capital crimes; he granted a general amneſty to deſerters and ſmugglers, and appointed two

               <p>Princes often-times apply themſelves by an affected condeſcenſion to win the hearts of the ſubjects.</p>
               <p>The people of Venice admire the goodneſs of their maſters, when they ſee the Doge at the head of the Senate making the yearly proceſſion to St. Maria Formoſa, to diſcharge a promiſe of one of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, and not ſcorning to accept of a ſtraw hat and two bottles of wine, that the artiſans of the pariſh preſent him for his trouble: when they ſee the Doge on the 1ſt of Auguſt accepting of a few melons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him by the gardeners, and allowing them to kiſs him: when they ſee the Senators aſſiſting with the Doge on Shrove-Tueſday at the ſlaughter of a bull, or at ſome other popular entertainment: when they ſee the grand-council on Corpus Chriſti day paſſing in proceſſion through St. Mark's place, each Noble yielding the right hand to a beggar.</p>
               <p>How ſtrange ſoever it may appear, Princes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attain to deſpotiſm by means which in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance tend to produce a contrary effect. In order to encreaſe their authority, ſome by a refinement of policy aſſume the character of juſtice, goodneſs and mercy; to deceive others, they take the outſide of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0044000700:25"/>plain dealing. Ximenes, became the idol of the Caſtillians by an apparent purity of manners, by his charity and munificence: the people not ſuſpecting him, left him to make what attempts upon their liberty he pleaſed, to keep in pay out of the revenue of his benefices mercenary troops, and augment the regal authority<note n="*" place="bottom">Bandier, Hiſt. de Ximenes.</note>.</p>
               <p>The people of Terra Ferma boaſt of the lenity of the government of the Seignory, when they ſee the popularity of the podeſtates, and the attention given by the inquiſitors of ſtate to their complaints againſt the nobles they hate; and from the opinion they entertain that the whole is done for their advantage alone, they bleſs the equity of their maſters.</p>
               <p>At other times, thoſe who govern, that they might conceal their own corruption, attempt to corrupt others; that they might conceal their own ambition, they flatter that of the people, they ſpeak to them perpetually of their rights, affect an extreme zeal for their intereſts, and raiſe themſelves to tyranny by affecting to protect them.</p>
               <p>But in order to enſlave mankind, Princes have even affected an averſion to Empire: Some have laboured to promote the public happineſs; and taking
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0044000700:26"/>advantage of that moment when the ſubjects exulted in their well-being, they pretended themſelves tired of the ſceptre, and reſolved to abdicate; expecting to be importuned to hold the reins of the Empire. The greateſt of evils this, ſince the Prince has the blind confidence of his people, and the means of abuſing it.</p>

                        <p>Some Princes have even perſecuted thoſe who have attempted to reform the people. Charles I. had W. Prynne ſentenced to a cruel puniſhment by the Star-Chamber, for having written againſt theatrical amuſements.</p>

                  <p>Cyrus, having conquered Lydia, was told that the inhabitants of that country had revolted; but not thinking fit to demoliſh their cities or ſecure them with ſtrong garriſons, inſtituted therein public plays,

                  <p>To ſubdue the ſpirit of their Engliſh ſubjects, the kings of the houſe of Stuart countenanced the general diſſipation. Under James I. ſpacious buildings were erected for exhibiting theatrical performances to the multitude. Maſks and mummings, drolls and dancings were the chief occupation of life.

And under Charles II. all ranks of men were given up to diſſipation, debauchery and riotous banquetting.</p>
                  <p>Modern Princes are very careful to have theatres conſtructed in the principal cities of their dominions.

                        <p>Our dramatic authors, depraved as the reſt, or degraded to ſervile flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, have complied with the taſte of the age; and, to their eternal ſhame, are buſy only in corrupting it ſtill more.

               <p>BY encouraging the fine arts and the ſciences among the Romans, Auguſtus ſubjected them to the yoke; and by the ſame method, his ſucceſſors ſubdued the barbarians they had vanquiſed<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>It may appear ſtrange, ſays a celebrated hiſtorian, that the progreſs of the arts and ſciences, which among the Greeks and Romans encreaſed every day the number of ſlaves, became in late times a general ſource of liberty; and, to clear this phenomenon, he has recourſe to a ſeries of vain arguments; whilſt a ſimple diſtinction is ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>When the rights of mankind are not the ſubject of our enquiries, ſtudy, by fixing the mind on foreign objects, neceſſarily cauſes it to loſe ſight of liberty: but when the ſanctuary of learning is opened to a barbarous people, by a natural progreſſion, they muſt neceſſarily turn their thoughts to the relations nature and ſociety have eſtabliſhed among men. The Romans were acquainted only with matters of war or ſtate; and in order to divert them therefrom, Auguſtus brought the fine arts into eſteem among them. Under feudal government, the people were extremely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; they loſt in their fetters even all ſenſe of liberty: but when they had begun to cultivate the ſciences, and turn their minds to meditation, they at laſt reflected their thoughts on themſelves, and were made conſcious of their rights.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>No people was ever ſo independent as the ancient Germans. Without fixed eſtabliſhments, continually engaged in ſome expedition for pillaging, exceſſively fond of liberty, and ever continuing in arms, they were but little reſtrained by laws, their Princes had
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0044000700:35"/>but little authority over them; and even that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was but little reſpected. But, when once they had ſecured their conqueſts, their Princes in order to extending and ſecuring their power, laboured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them with the love of tranquil employments, to acquaint them with the ſweet fruits of induſtry, to engage them to cultivate the arts of peace, and devote themſelves to a contemplative life.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the crown of England was ſecured on the head of Alfred, this Prince took great care to inſpire his ſubjects with the love of arts and ſciences; and the better to encourage them to apply themſelves to ſtudy, he ſet them the example, and was attentive to reward merit<note n="*" place="bottom">Aſſer. p. 13.

               <p>Spain, almoſt continually torn by factions, ſedition and civil wars, was, till the reign of Ferdinand V. ſunk into barbarity, its inhabitants being only ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially acquainted with war and politics: but in order to extend his power, Ferdinand begun to introduce into his dominions the love of letters, by diſtributing favours to thoſe who addicted themſelves thereto<note n="†" place="bottom">Zurita.

               <p>Philip II. and Philip III. both eager after abſolute command, befriended with all their power the arts and

               <p>At firſt the ſubjects are indulged with feaſts and ſhows, but as theſe entertainments cannot long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, unleſs the Prince has the diſpoſal of the ſpoils of the whole world, a laſting ſource of corruption is then opened to the people: induſtry is encouraged, and commerce rendered flouriſhing<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>This aſſertion will undoubtedly appear very ſtrange to thoſe, who have their eyes fixed on the feudal government degenerated into deſpotiſm or oligarchy. Princes encourage induſtry and commerce in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, they will ſay, in order to increaſe their revenues, not to abaſe their ſubjects: I requeſt the reader to conſider, that I do not ſpeak of a people already under the yoke, but of thoſe who are intended to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected thereto. Thus, not mentioning the efforts made ſome centuries ago, in the ſtates of Venice, Genoa, Florence, in France, Spain, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp;c. to encourage induſtry, arts and commerce among the ſubjects, let us conſider what attempts in that reſpect have been made by Princes of a free people. The antient Britons, like the Goths, and other Celtic nations, were almoſt entirely independant; and as long as they remained ſplit into many ſmall tribes, with no other poſſeſſions but their arms and flocks, it proved impoſſible to their chieftains to become abſolute. But in order to ſubject them, the Romans introduced the arts of peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and urbanity. Agricola chiefly taught them to procure themſelves 
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0044000700:38"/>the conveniencies of life, he endeavoured to render their condition pleaſing; and the Britons ſo much ſubmitted themſelves to the domination of their new maſters, that, once ſubdued, they gave them no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, and loſt all deſire, even all idea of their former independency. <hi>Tacit. in Agricol.</hi>

               <p>ONE effect of luxury is the extinguiſhing the heroic virtues; for, when men can attract notice by ſumptuous equipages, coſtly dreſs, long retinue of ſervants, they are no more ſolicitous of attracting it by upright manners, noble ſentiments, glorious deeds.</p>
               <p>Luxury is immediately attended by a looſeneſs of manners, which is the beginning of their depravation: both ſexes meet together in order to render their intercourſe more agreeable, and corrupt themſelves reciprocally; gallantry is introduced; this produces a frivolous turn of mind, puts a value on trifles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes whatever is of any concern; and duty is ſoon forgotten.</p>
               <p>The arts which luxury maintains, and the pleaſures it promiſes, rendering ſociety delightful, hurry us away to effeminacy; they ſoften our manners, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0044000700:39"/>enervate that haughtineſs which endures neither fetters nor reſtraint.</p>
               <p>By concealing with flowers the chains which are prepared for us, they extinguiſh in our ſouls the ſenſe of liberty, and make us in love with ſervitude.</p>
               <p>Hence Princes generally neglect nothing which may bring luxury into eſteem: they recommend it by their<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>As luxury ſo much charms the multitude, as to induce them to be guilty of a thouſand extravagancies, ever attended with the ruin of the ſtate, Princes, after having countenanced it, were often obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it. But by a contraſt not uncommon, while they repreſſed luxury by their proclamations, they encouraged it by their example.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt Lewis XIV. prohibited, by his edicts to the lieutenants-general and other officers of his armies who kept an open table, the ſerving up of any other diſhes, except pottage, roaſt-meat, and the like, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſplayed on his table the productions of all climates. Whilſt he fixed the quantity of gold or ſilver to be allowed for plate, furniture, equipage, dreſs, &amp;c. he himſelf ſquandered the public money in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent extravagancies.</p>
                     <p>Let Princes iſſue out as many proclamations as they pleaſe, luxury will not the leſs prevail. Thoſe ordonances act even againſt the purpoſe they are intended for, as they give more value to what they prohibit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the deſire of enjoying it. From this very conſideration they are ſometimes made.</p>
                  </note> example; they diſplay every where page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry and magnificence, and are the firſt to ſow in the minds of their ſubjects thoſe ſeeds of corruption<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>The exceſſive love of pleaſure, that poſſeſſed the courts of James I. Charles II. Louis XIV. &amp;c. infected all ranks of men. Every day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0044000700:40"/>ſome feaſt, and every night ſome maſk, in which people of fortune engaged: diſſipation and luxury took place of ſimplicity and application.</p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0044000700:39"/>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0044000700:40"/>If Princes recommend not luxury by their example, they at leaſt countenance it, or refuſe to reſtrain it. The Roman Senate, ſtill compoſed of grave Magiſtrates, propoſed to Auguſtus the reformation of the manners and of the luxury of women; but though obliged by his office of Cenſor to attend to it, he ever artfully avoided the importunate requeſt of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators<note n="†" place="bottom">Dio Caſſius, lib. liv.</note>.</p>
               <p>Some have gone even ſo far as to force their ſubjects to ſink into effeminacy. In order to ſubdue the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Cuma, Ariſtomenes laboured to enervate the courage of the youth: he ordered the boys to let their hair grow, to adorn their heads with flowers, and, like girls, to wear long gowns of various colours; he commanded them, when going to their dancing or ſinging maſters, to be attended by women with umbrellas and fans; in the bath they were to be ſerved with looking-glaſſes, combs and perfumes: this way of education was continued till they were twenty years of age<note n="‡" place="bottom">Dionyſ. Halicarn. lib. vii.</note>.</p>
               <p>Thus by enervating and corrupting the people, luxury ſubdues them without reſiſtance to the will of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0044000700:41"/>an imperious Maſter, and forces them to purchaſe, at the price of their liberty, the quiet life and ſoft pleaſures they are permitted to enjoy.</p>

                  <p>LUXURY not only enervates the minds, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is better calculated to divide them; when once introduced into a ſtate, the union of its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is deſtroyed; every one endeavours to attract notice, to become more conſpicuous than his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and riſe above the common level. Careleſs of the good of the public, they then attend to their private intereſts only; the love of one's patria is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in every heart; the citizen diſappears, and the man remains.</p>
                  <p>Luxury, as it extends itſelf, ranks ſuperfluity among neceſſaries. At firſt the people abandon themſelves to diſſipation; it becomes habitual to them; pleaſures are neceſſary; and as every one cannot enjoy them equally, they are actuated by various ſentiments: on one ſide are envy, jealouſy, hatred; on the other, pride and contempt—new ſeeds of diſcord!<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>How many Princes have fomented theſe diviſions by their ordonances. In an edict of 1294, Philip the Fair prohibited the burgeſſes from wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ermine, gold and jewels, all which were permitted to the nobility.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0044000700:42"/>To burgeſſes worth 2000 livres he allowed cloth of 12 pence a yard; to the leſs rich, cloth of 8 pence; but prelates and barons were permitted to wear cloth of 25 pence a yard.</p>
                        <p>Other Princes have made ſimilar ordinances.</p>

                  <p>WHEN once men are corrupted by luxury, new deſires prey alternately on the mind. If the means of indulging them are wanting, every one buſies himſelf to ſupport the extravagances in which he delights.</p>
                  <p>The evil grows worſe every day, ſince from much endeavouring to be diſtinguiſhed, no one at laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes himſelf any more; but as a rank is taken, and as a deſire of attracting the eyes of the public ſtill continues, every nerve is bent in order to get out of that intolerable uniformity. From that time there is no proportion between the wants and the means; every one is eager after riches, and bows down in the temple of Fortune. How many voluntary ſlaves!</p>
                  <p>Finally, a multitude of ſubjects, needy by their new wants, and vexed to be the meaneſt of all, vainly agitate themſelves to get off their humiliating poverty, and are at laſt reduced to wiſh for their country's deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0044000700:43"/>Such is the powerful influence of luxury, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times nothing more is wanting to compleat the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liberty, even in countries the moſt fond of it.</p>
                  <p>As long as Rome was inhabited by poor citizens, honeſty, honour, courage, and love of liberty, were incloſed within its walls; but when once it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with the ſpoils of vanquiſhed nations, theſe ancient virtues gave way to a multitude of vices. Notwithſtanding the wiſdom of the laws, no ſooner were its gates open to the riches of the enemy, but Rome ceaſed to acknowledge its degenerated off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring; manners and duties became oppoſite to each other; poverty, till then honoured, fell into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; gold became the object of every one's deſire; luxury expanded itſelf with rapidity; all plunged headlong into voluptuouſneſs: and when pleaſures had once impoveriſhed theſe Sybarites, a multitude of laviſh citizens, aſhamed of their poverty, caballed from ambition, and diſturbed public tranquillity; whilſt ſome powerful men alternately put themſelves at the head of the mob, tore the ſtate to pieces, ſpilled the blood of the citizens, uſurped the ſupreme power, and ſilenced the laws.

               <p>ANOTHER method, put in practice for ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubjects, is the keeping them in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not controuling their pleaſures. They then, careleſs of liberty, take no concern in public affairs,

               <p>When once the people become fond of money, if none is to be got but by giving up their birth-rights, they ſubmit to the yoke, and impatiently wait for their ſalary.</p>
               <p>If the Prince is moreover attentive at times to entertain them, they are baſe enough to bleſs their tyrant.</p>

               <p>The Venetians take great care to maintain their ſubjects in plenty, to ſet them free from moral reſtraint, and indulge them with ſhews. Far from controuling the pleaſures of the citizens, they give encouragement to lewdneſs, by publicly protecting houſes of ill fame; and thus divert the ſubjects from taking any concern in matters of ſtate.

               <p>IN a country, where the Prince diſpoſes of benefices, places and dignities, though by their means he ever gets friends, he at firſt grants none but to deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons; but when once he has ſucceeded in abaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and depraving his ſubjects, he thinks of getting creatures.</p>
               <p>The great, being maſters of the lower claſſes of people, are ſo in ſome ſort of the ſtate; and with them the Prince begins to ſhare authority: he dazzles the ſight of one by a ribbon, ſeduces another by an employment, temptations are offered every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his favourite paſſions, and men eagerly preſent their necks to the yoke.</p>
               <p>Beſides the ſmall number of powerful men, who fill up the firſt places of the ſtate, he holds by hope thoſe ambitious men who continually ſeek after favour and preferment.

               <p>WHILST the deſire of acquiring fame burns in the breaſt of the ſubjects, and they are greedy after glory alone, liberty is never more ſecure. They ſtand unſhaken at dangers, diſheartened by no obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and reſtrained by no conſideration; leſs fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0044000700:50"/>the moſt horrid torture, than the opprobrium of betraying their country to a tyrant.</p>
               <p>Princes accordingly loſe no opportunity of changing the object of glory. For fame, which the public diſpenſes, they ſubſtitute honours which they alone diſtribute; and inſtead of making dignities the reward of ſervices done the patria, they make honours the ſalary of ſervices tendered to them. Thus their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are covered both with infamy and marks of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and theſe marks of note are ſoon valued at the expence of merit, virtue and talents.</p>
               <p>Hence ariſe two oppoſite effects: men of abject principles ſeek after dignities, men of an elevated mind deſpiſe them. Diſgraced by the uſe they are made of, and the perſons on whom they are beſtowed, to become worthy of them is no more the purſuit of noble ſouls.

               <p>In order to be in favour with the monarch, they ſpeak emphatically of his little merit; they allow him to poſſeſs virtues of every kind, and extol the happineſs of being under his empire<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>It is oftentimes the caſe with both houſes of parliament, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion words to things in their addreſſes of thanks to the throne. How little ſoever be the deſert of the monarch, they always give him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained encomiums. Let him do right or wrong, they praiſe him for every thing, thank him for every thing, and never ſo much as when he deſerves neither thanks nor praiſes. For the rulers of the Britiſh Empire, what a diſgraceful part! It will be ſaid, that theſe fawning addreſſes are but empty words; but whilſt praiſes are proſtituted, what remains to be ſaid to a good king, to a true father of his people? Where are the allurements of virtue, whilſt flattery beſtows on others the encomiums which belong to virtuous men alone?

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0044000700:52"/>or be incited to grace the throne? Fortunately thoſe baſe flatteries ſink into contempt; thoſe venal diſcourſes, cenſured by the public, are reduced to their juſt value.</p>
                     <p>It is not in thoſe addreſſes, it is ſaid, that one muſt look for the ſpirit and love of liberty. So much the worſe: flattery and venality are linked together, the one goes rarely without the other, and both are always attended with ſlavery.</p>

               <p>Deſtitute of virtue, they cannot bear it in others; and exert all their addreſs in ridiculing them: on all occaſions they depreſs glorious deeds, aſperſe good men, and by the moſt humiliating epithets ſtigmatize the lovers of liberty.</p>
               <p>At firſt, their baſe diſcourſes are deſpiſed; but, by conſtantly repeating the ſame without bluſhing, they amaze their adverſaries, and humble them by deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their blows. Beſides, as ſuch effrontery in facing ridicule impoſes upon the multitude, incapable of appraiſing things at their juſt value, contempt ends and admiration begins.</p>
               <p>On his part, the Prince ſcarcely riſes any to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities but in proportion as they prove ſervile. Never
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0044000700:53"/>ſure of his favour, unleſs ever ready to betray their engagements, they are diſgraced from the moment they remember their duty. Mean flatterers, and thoſe wretches who ſell their conſcience that they might ſell their protection, are therefore the only perſons who can bear themſelves up in ſuch a thorny place. Thus all vices reign at courts; there flattery, perjury, and contempt of all duty, parade with effrontery.</p>
               <p>Not being allowed to live as one might wiſh, every one lives according to the times, men, and affairs; even the wiſeſt have but a frigid admiration for virtue, and the beſt patriots are but little concerned for the public good.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of diſuniting the People.</head>
               <p>HAVING engaged the people to loſe fight of their patria, an attempt is made to annihilate the love of it in their hearts. Men united by liberty and for liberty muſt remain free, as long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main united; to be enſlaved they therefore ought to be divided, and time never fails to offer an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for it.</p>
               <p>Almoſt in every ſtate, there are from its foundation various ranks of people; nobles ever diſdain the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians, and plebeians ever hate the nobles, or rather, every one who belongs to any rank, hates or deſpiſes thoſe who belong to another: theſe baſe paſſions Princes make uſe of to ſow diſſention, and alienate the affections of the people from their patria.</p>
               <p>If there is originally no diverſity of ranks, thoſe at the helm labour to introduce it: they divide the people into different claſſes, and to every one aſſign
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0044000700:55"/>particular employments, rights or privileges. The one is appointed to magiſtracies, the other to military ſervices; this to eccleſiaſtical benefices, that to trade and mechanical arts.</p>
               <p>Till the ſeceſſion of the Romans, the patricians only were nominated to the magiſtracy; and till the emperors, every order of citizens was not admitted to military ſervice.</p>
               <p>None but noblemen were to be admitted into the order of knights templars, and none are to be admitted into that of knights of Malta, but thoſe whoſe nobility can be proved by many deſcents.</p>
               <p>In France, noblemen, military men, and the king's honorary councellors alone, are free from a land-tax, called <hi>la taille.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to incite jealouſy among his ſubjects, Philip II. of Spain, ſettled in 1586, by proclamation, a ceremonial to be obſerved in regard to the grandees, miniſters, and prelates; he likewiſe fixed the titles by which the citizens were to be ſtiled, and ordered the refractory to be proſecuted by law.</p>
               <p>At Venice, the different orders of<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The body of the cytadini is compoſed of the ſecretaries of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, of the notaries, phyſicians, lawyers, woollen and ſilk mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and of the glaſs-makers of Maron; that is to ſay, of the moſt powerful citizens.</p>
                  </note> cytadini are diſtinguiſhed the one from the other, and all from
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0044000700:56"/>the vulgar, by peculiar privileges. The firſt order is appointed to the reſidentſhip of foreign courts, and to the ſecretaryſhip of counſels and embaſſies; into their families patricians are permitted to marry; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſome of them are incorporated into the body of the nobility, inſtead of thoſe families which become extinct: the other cytadini are permitted to take the gown of the nobles. Thus they are all engaged to unite with the maſters of the commonwealth againſt the reſt of the people.</p>
               <p>But as if this craft was ſtill inſufficient, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration ſows diſſention among the rabble of the different wards of the city, and conſtantly keeps up two oppoſite parties<note n="*" place="bottom">The Nicoloti and Caſtellani.</note> by ſecretly encouraging fighting among them on one particular day of the year.</p>
               <p>Of their ſubjects of Terra Ferma, the burgeſſes are treated with indulgency, the nobles with ſeverity.</p>
               <p>Looking upon the Paduans as the antient maſters of Venice, the ſeignory took particular care to keep them diſunited. For that purpoſe, the moſt powerful families were tranſported to Venice, and ſuch privileges granted to the ſtudents of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity as to incenſe the jealouſy of the citizens.</p>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0044000700:57"/>Princes, not ſatisfied with dividing the people into various orders, enjoying divers privileges, artfully incite diſcord in every order by means of odious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions<note n="*" place="bottom">

Peter Erizza being podeſtate at Udina, as the nobility of the Frioul were then in very good correſpondence among themſelves, was ordered to ſet them at variance; and for that purpoſe received from the ſenate the power of granting the title of count or marquis to whom he ſhould think proper.

                  <p>IN order to ſow diſcord among their ſubjects, almoſt all Princes have tolerated different religious ſects: ſome of them have even countenanced particular ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries; others, with the ſame views, have perſecuted them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe artifices prove ſo deſtructive to liberty, that by their aid many Princes have governed their people in an arbitrary manner.—A truth of which we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have more than once had the ſad experience.</p>

                  <p>"As Henry VIII. was a ſlave to his furious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, each party flattered themſelves that a blind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the king's will would throw him fully into their intereſts, and they implicitly put themſelves into his hands."</p>
                  <p>While the people were in ſucceeding times divided into Whigs and Tories, and as ſoon as theſe two fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made irreconcileable by the artifices of the court, and could counterbalance the forces of each other, Charles II. pulled off the maſk, diſſolved the parliament; and the nation beheld with aſtoniſhment, a king who had received ſo many mortifications from the legiſlative powers, and had been ſo often obliged to ſubmit, on a ſudden, without fleet, without army, without money, and without foreign aſſiſtance, become abſolute maſter of his kingdom; letting his oppoſers feel the terrible effects of his vengeance, ſacrificing the moſt ſpirited patriots to his rage, and governing his ſubjects with a tyrannical ſway.</p>

               <p>PRINCES cannot alone ruin liberty, they abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely want ſome aid; and as their miniſters are to be their chief tools of tyranny, they commit the execution of their dark deſigns to crafty men, to men without honour, honeſty, and conſcience. Some of the moſt artful confer no office, no place of any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but to men of new families, who being ſenſible that they owe every thing to royal favour, are content to ſupport the power of the crown, though at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of juſtice and national privileges; and the better to ſecure their projects, they even admit but few into the cabinet.</p>
               <p>Henry VII. ever ruled by a faction, and that by the leſſer faction. To give full ſcope to his tyrannical rapacity, he nominated for his miniſters Empſon and Dudley, two profligate men, equally enabled by their knowledge in the law to pervert the forms of juſtice to the oppreſſion of the innocent, and perfectly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to prey upon the defenceleſs people.</p>
               <p>Louis XI. truſted none with the firſt places of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but men that were corrupt and of baſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0044000700:61"/>extraction: theſe were his ſole confidents, and the miniſters of his ambitious deſigns.</p>

               <p>LIBERTY is eſtabliſhed on the laws alone; but as the laws ever ſpeak by the mouths of men, in order to render them deluſive and uſeleſs, Princes ſet on the benches corrupted judges, or they corrupt thoſe who are ſitting.</p>

               <p>Charles I. bribed the judges of the high-court of juſtice; and not content with this, under colour of reforming abuſes, granted a commiſſion to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, and other members of the privy-council, for regulating the juriſdiction of all the courts of judicature in the kingdom. Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were to examine all queſtions, controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and debates, ariſing about the juriſdiction of the courts, civil and eccleſiaſtical.

               <p>At other times, thoſe at the helm induce ſome of their tools to propoſe, in the name of the public, the projects in view; deceived by appearance, the people again fall into the ſnare.</p>

               <p>If the Prince erects no court of juſtice, he changes the eſtabliſhed forms of law, alters the tenure by which the judges hold their places, ſets them above the cenſure of the legiſlative powers, makes their judgments arbitrary, and calls before them all cauſes.</p>

If ſometimes they follow violent meaſures, it is only in relation to ſome notorious villain, whoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though arbitrarily inflicted, is always agreeable to the people, more mindful of their own intereſts than jealous of their liberty, and ever ready to confirm the unjuſt power which is at laſt to oppreſs them.</p>

               <p>In a free country, it is with his ſubjects as volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, that the Prince attacks the enemy; with them
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0044000700:71"/>he makes a conqueſt or defends the ſtate. But at the head of men wedded to their country he dares not make any attempt againſt liberty; mercenary troops are therefore thought neceſſary to ſubvert the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Princes accordingly have all laboured, as ſoon as it was in their power, to have ſuch troops; and in order to ſucceed, they have employed many artifices.</p>
               <p>Charles VII. of France, availing himſelf of the reputation which he had acquired in expelling the Engliſh out of his kingdom, and taking advantage of the impreſſion of terror which the enemy had left on the minds of his ſubjects, effected the<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtoire de France, par Velly &amp; Villaret, tom. xv. p. 332, &amp;c.</note> eſtabliſhment of a ſtanding army. Under pretence of putting the ſtate in a poſture of defence on any ſudden invaſion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his ſervice a body of ſixteen thouſand infantry and nine thouſand cavalry; he appointed officers to command them, and ſtationed them at his pleaſure in different parts of the kingdom. Thus, inſtead of the auxiliary tenants of the barons, attached only to the chieftain whoſe banner they followed, and accuſtomed to obey no other command, the King had troops that were taught to acknowledge a maſter, to obey his orders, and expect from him the reward of their ſervices.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0044000700:72"/>Under the pious pretence of keeping always on foot a force ſufficient to oppoſe the frequent incurſions of the Moors from Africa, and to reſiſt the progreſs of the infidels, Ximenes, regent of Caſtile, iſſued out a proclamation commanding every city in that kingdom to enroll a certain number of its burgeſſes; he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to be trained to the uſe of arms, engaged officers to command them, and took this new militia into his ſervice<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Nobles of Caſtile, alarmed at the repeated attempts made by Ximenes for extending the power of the crown, began to utter loud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and formed many cabals; but before they proceeded to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they deputed ſome of their number to the Cardinal, to enquire into the power in conſequence of which he exerciſed acts of ſuch authority. In anſwer to their demand, Ximenes produced the teſtament of Ferdinand, by which he was appointed regent of the Spaniſh monarchy; then leading them towards a balcony, from which they had a view of a large body of troops under arms, and of a formidable train of artillery—<hi>Behold,</hi> ſays he, pointing to theſe, <hi>the power which I have received from his Catholic Majeſty; with theſe I govern Caſtile, and with theſe I will govern it."</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera's Hiſt. lib. viii.</p>

               <p>While we were under feodal government, the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary power was lodged in the hands of the barons; but as it always proved but very little ſerviceable to the crown, and ſometimes dangerous, Henry V. exchanged,<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </note> under various pretences, military ſervice for pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary contribution, and ſubſtituted to the military
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0044000700:73"/>tenants of the nobles a new militia, much more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to execute his orders. Henry's ſucceſſors pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his plan; ſome of them even attempted to have a ſtanding army, and at laſt ſucceeded. Immediately after Monmouth's invaſion, James II. demanded a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy for keeping on foot ſome regular troops, under pretence of being ready at any time to face a new danger<note n="*" place="bottom">See his ſpeech to parliament in 1685</note>. But a ſtanding army, properly ſpeaking, was unknown in England till the acceſſion of the houſe of Brunſwick. Through the very earneſt deſire of George I. a conſiderable body of troops was taken into conſtant pay, to maintain the tranquillity of the kingdom, and anſwer the ends of the treaty of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover.</p>
               <p>In the other ſtates of Europe, the ſcheme of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armies has likewiſe been purſued with eagerneſs, and executed with ſuch ſucceſs, that, the Swiſs excepted, there are no patriotic ſoldiery; every where merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries ſtand armed by tyranny againſt liberty.</p>
               <p>As theſe troops were raiſed under the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of defending the ſtate, men tied to their country by ſome eſtabliſhment were at firſt enrolled. Such ſoldiers proved but little ſubmiſſive: in order to get ſoldiers more devoted, Princes were ſenſible that their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0044000700:74"/>armies ought to be compoſed of men, who having no property, no principle, might be ever as ready to march againſt their countrymen as againſt the enemy.</p>
               <p>In proportion as induſtry increaſes and commerce flouriſhes, inequality extends itſelf; part of the people ſwallows up all the riches, the remainder, abaſed by miſery or contemptible employments, ſubſiſts only by the vices or follies of the opulent, and poſſeſſes an induſtry which weds them to no country. Of this abject populace, deſtitute of all knowledge, of every virtue, of every principle of honour, without patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and aſhamed of their indigence, Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their armies.</p>
               <p>But as if national mercenaries were not ſufficiently devoted to tyranny, Princes, to oppreſs their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, have recourſe to foreigners.</p>
               <p>In France, there are in the regal armies, Swiſs, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicans, Italians, Scotch, Iriſh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In Spain, there are Italians, Swiſs, Germans, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In Pruſſia, half of the troops are French or Poliſh.</p>
               <p>In England, there are indeed no foreign ſoldiery, but ſeveral Scotch regiments are conſtantly ſtationed there, and from the good harmony which reigns between the two nations, the king reſigns to them the odious part of oppreſſing his Engliſh ſubjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0044000700:75"/>Some Princes are not ſatisfied with having at their command foreign troops, but will even keep no others.</p>
               <p>In all their expeditions, offenſive or defenſive, the ſenate of Venice have avoided, with the greateſt care, arming the citizens, even on the moſt urgent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>In the time of the league of Cambray, the ſenate ſeeing the wretched ſtate of their affairs, took into ſervice ſoldiers of the enemy at a zequin a day.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Moſt Princes have carried their policy ſo far as to diſarm their ſubjects on different pretences; fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhould ever be made ſenſible of their own force, and ſhould uſe it to repel oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>Under colour of public ſafety, the regency of Spain in 1669, iſſued out a proclamation, forbidding the citizens of Madrid keeping fire-arms<note n="†" place="bottom">Deſormeaux, Abreg. Chronol. de l'Hiſt. d'Eſpag.</note>.</p>
               <p>In France the peaſants have been diſarmed under pretence of preventing their hunting; and in the whole kingdom, the capital excepted, only noblemen, military men, and honorary officers of the king are permitted to wear arms.</p>
               <p>At Venice, the wearing of arms is prohibited by the moſt ſevere law.</p>
               <p>Thus Princes, having armed mercenary troops againſt the people; under pretence of ſecuring public tranquillity, tie the hands of their ſubjects, the more eaſily to enſlave them.</p>

               <p>THE Prince, having now grounded his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, forms attempts upon liberty with leſs caution. As it is ſeldom the caſe that a whole nation is concerned for an injured ſubject<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Some tools of the miniſtry have raiſed their clamours againſt the <hi>Society of the Bill of Rights;</hi> they have even carried their effrontery ſo far as to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid this ſociety with the rank of its members. Let their rank be what it will, their attempt is bold, it is praiſeworthy, noble, and generous. Inſtead of giving ear to thoſe detractions, the nation ought rather to have followed 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0044000700:77"/>ſuch a ſpirited example, and eſtabliſhed a fund for proſecuting, at the public expence, the miniſter, whenever he injures any unſupported ſubject. In order to maintain their liberty, the people ought to eſpouſe, againſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, the cauſe even of the meaneſt individual, when oppreſſed. Whilſt the members of the ſtate ſeparate their intereſt, the conſtitution has no ſtrength, and ſlavery is approaching.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0044000700:77"/>attacks the privileges of the people by incroaching upon the rights of individuals.</p>
               <p>If the injured parties make any expoſtulation about the violence offered them, awed by power, too fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conteſt with the miniſter, or unable to bear the charges of a law-ſuit; they are obliged to ſuffer the injury, and ſubmit to oppreſſion. Thus the queſtion not being determined, the outrages of the Prince paſs unrepreſſed; and, inſtead of appearing firmly in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of thoſe who ſuffer in the public cauſe, the others baſely deſert them, and the unfortunate fall like vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims devoted to their ill fate.</p>
               <p>If the Prince has to do with men able to conteſt with him, he attempts to prevail over them. If his efforts prove unſucceſsful, he lets ſlip no opportunity to weary the adverſe parties by formality, adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and expences; he is intent in perplexing them by cavilling at law, in order, if poſſible, to prevent the matter being finally decided.</p>
               <p>When he cannot diſmiſs the adverſe parties, he ſometimes makes an attempt upon their lives.</p>

               <p>To defend his own rights, a private man has no reſource but to make application to a court of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, almoſt always preſided over, and oftentimes wholly compoſed of miniſterial tools<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>In our days, bribery diſgraces ſometimes the courts of juſtice among us. The preſident, being commonly a creature of the Prince, is not wanting in prepoſſeſſing the judges in favour of the crown, and in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalling their opinion: the judges themſelves often yield to bribery; and in every cauſe where adminiſtration is concerned, a devoted jury may always be got. Of this we have a clear proof in the caſe of Mr. Wilkes, relating to the ſecretaries of ſlate. "The day before Mr. Wilkes's trial, letters ſigned <hi>The Summoning Officer,</hi> were ſent to ſeveral of the jury, acquainting them that Mr. Wilkes's trial was put off to another day; which prevented thoſe to whom theſe letters were ſent from attending their duty at Weſtminſter-hall, at the real time of his trial. In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim another jury was packed, which found him guilty." Hiſtory of the late Minority.</p>
                  </note>. Let his claim be ever ſo legal; juſtice and law, too weak againſt power and ſecret practices, are impotent ſupporters of his rights. Even thoſe who argue, generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by fear or reſpect, are not ſo bold as to make
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0044000700:79"/>good his title with ſpirit<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>I confeſs with pleaſure that ſuch is not commonly our caſe. There are ſtill among us patriotic lawyers, and their number is not ſmall: but amidſt ſo many zealous ſupporters of the rights of the people, the name of Glynn will ever grace the annals of liberty.</p>
                  </note>; whilſt the counſel of the adverſe party, ſafe under the royal banners, and emboldened by favour, extenuate it, or put upon it a falſe conſtruction. Cunning is oppoſed to juſtice, ſophiſm to reaſon, falſehood to truth; no pains are wanting to ſeduce the judges in favour of tyranny. The judges themſelves, ſeduced or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, run into oppreſſive vengeance; and, to gratify their intereſted views, proſtitute juſtice to power<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>During the fatal reigns of Henry VII. Henry VIII. Mary, James I. Charles I. Charles II. and James II. with what ſhocking profligacy did the judges proſtitute themſelves to the crown: With what unexampled inſolence they oppreſſed the unfortunate, proſecuted by thoſe tyrants! Without ſhame, ſcruple, or remorſe, they followed with a blind devotion every order from the court, and for the ſame deed condemned one day the man whom they had acquitted a day before. Amidſt ſo many inſtances of this kind, let this ſuffice.—The king's counſel, who were againſt the famous Titus Oates, proſecuted by James II. had been for him in the trial of the five Jeſuits, particularly the attorney-general and ſolicitor-general.</p>

                     <p>In 1628, the attorney-general exhibited an information in the exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer againſt Samuel Vaſſal, a merchant of London, for refuſing to pay
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0044000700:80"/>the new duty of five ſhillings and ſix-pence on every hundred weight of currants. To this information Vaſſal pleaded the ſtatutes of Magna Charta, the ſtatute de tallagio non concedendo, and that this duty was impoſed without aſſent of parliament. The barons of the exchequer refuſed to hear Vaſſal's counſel argue for him, and ſaid, "that the king was in poſſeſſion, and that they would keep him in it."

                     <p>In the cauſes brought before the high courts of juſtice againſt the crown under the Stuarts, the ſword was always lifted up on the head of thoſe who dared to defend the rights of the people; whilſt thoſe who were for regal prerogative, ſafe under the banners of the crown, urged with effron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery the moſt palpable falſehoods.</p>

               <p>THE people ſeldom foreſee their fate. Render their birthrights illuſive, undermine their liberty; they perceive their miſerable ſervitude only when they feel it, when they hear the names of the proſcribed, when they ſee the blood of their fellow ſubjects, or when cruſhed under the yoke, they, trembling, expect the puniſhment they are to undergo.</p>
               <p>The ſubjects, in order to maintain their liberty, ought to watch the motions of the miniſtry with a jealous eye. Men are never ſo eaſily undone, as when they ſuſpect no danger; and too great ſecurity in a nation is almoſt always the forerunner of ſlavery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0044000700:82"/>But as a continual attention to public affairs is above the reach of the multitude; in a ſtate jealous of its liberty, there never ſhould be wanting ſome men to watch the tranſactions of the miniſters, unveil their ambitious projects, givean alarm at the approach of the ſtorm, rouſe the people from their lethargy, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the abyſs open before them, and point out thoſe on whom the public indignation ought to fall. The greateſt misfortune, therefore, which can attend a free country, where the Prince is powerful and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, is, that no party, no commotion, no faction agitate the minds of the ſubjects. All is undone, when the people are unconcerned for public affairs; on the contrary, liberty conſtantly ſprings up out of the fires of ſedition.</p>

               <p>Great care ought to be taken chiefly not to incite them to the purſuit of a falſe, or even doubtful object. When the ſubjects proceed ſo far as to put themſelves in a poſture of defending their rights, it is of great concern to liberty that they be not overcome.

               <p>WHEN adminiſtration is cenſured, the charges againſt it ought conſtantly to be ſupported by incontrovertible facts. If the ſubjects, in a juſt cauſe, make any inconſiderate ſtep, it ſuffices to ruin their affairs. The Prince, who at firſt trembled under the laſh of the malcontents, while they confined
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0044000700:84"/>themſelves within the bounds of prudence, triumphs as ſoon as they go beyond; he complains in his turn, he proſecutes thoſe who have handled the pen; and leaving the public grievances for his private injuries, he oftentimes ſucceeds in making the people loſe ſight of the principal object. Thus the friends of liberty, who, by cautious proceedings, might have been vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, loſe by a ſingle act of imprudence the fruit of their paſt efforts.</p>

               <p>THE manner in which the cauſe of the public is defended, is not of little concern to liberty. When tyranny is complained of, let it be always in a grave and animated ſtile. Satirical writers attack indeed the tyrant, but not tyranny; and far from reminding him of his duty, they mortally wound his pride, they exaſperate and incenſe him the more.</p>
               <p>Satirical ſtrokes avail not but to promote ſervitude: and although ſenſible men might look upon them not as upon exaggerated charges, they go not the leſs againſt the aim intended. For by affording fewel to public malignity<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>It is a conſtant practice with the French to eaſe their grief about public misfortunes with ſongs and epigrams.</p>

               <p>IT has been ſaid, that in a ſtate jealous of its liberty, ſome men ought never to be wanting to reclaim the laws when violated by the Prince, to rouſe the people from their lethargy, to guide them in difficult caſes, and bring them back to their rights. But as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0044000700:87"/>the human mind, when too long intent upon any object, becomes weary of it; all is undone, if in exciting the patriotic zeal of the people, their ſpirits be exhauſted, and their zeal rendered extinct.</p>
               <p>This unfortunately has happened to us in our late diſſenſions. Plagued with ſo many writings, and exhauſted by our own efforts, we are at preſent reduced to ſuch an apathy that nothing is able to fix our attention.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXV.</hi> Of the exceſſive Moderation of the People.</head>
               <p>TO overturn the conſtitution, Princes commonly undermine it, they innovate by degrees, ſeldom in a flagrant manner. But the people are neither attentive nor ſagacious enough to obſerve thoſe innovations, nor foreſee the conſequences of them; and if they were, they have not ſpirit enough to oppoſe them. The firſt innovations, however, ought to be ſtrongly oppoſed, in order to maintain liberty. When once abuſes are grown inveterate, with the more difficulty are they reformed, they even many times admit of no remedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0044000700:88"/>To maintain themſelves free, the people ought readily to eſpouſe the cauſe of any individual oppreſſed by the Prince. When ſubjects ſeparate their intereſts, they are ſubdued one after another, and liberty is undone. Far from being ready to protect the rights of others, every one muſt have ſeen his own rights many times flagrantly attacked, before he reſolves to defend them; and it is difficult to conceive how great advantage the government takes from that want of ſpirit to oppoſe its criminal attempts, and how much it concerns liberty that ſubjects be not ſo patient.</p>
               <p>When Charles I. began to put his impure hands into the purſes of his ſubjects, or to offer them the ſhocking ſcene of a ſavage cruelty in the perſons of the unfortunate wretches who were doomed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, had the people taken arms, marched againſt the tyrant, and condemned the miniſters of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to the ſcaffold, they never had ſo long groaned under the moſt odious oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>Yet I would not adviſe a people to have recourſe at every inſtant to violent meaſures: but under colour of not diſturbing the public tranquillity, quiet men do not perceive that they gain nothing by their indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but to be oppreſſed with more impunity; that they encourage tyranny, and that when they at
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0044000700:89"/>laſt undertake to ſtop its progreſs, it often proves too late.</p>
               <p>The ſacrilegious ambition of Princes prompts them to make attempts upon liberty; but the cowardice of the people alone permits their fetters to be forged. Ambitious as they are, Princes would be leſs enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing if they were always to make themſelves a way to abſolute power by force and violence.

               <p>WHEN the clamours of the oppreſſed ſubjects are at length excited, the Prince ſtrives to prevent the voice of the public from being heard:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0044000700:90"/>he ſends his emiſſaries every where to ſeduce the meaneſt claſs of the people, and engage them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent flattering addreſſes, which are artfully put in oppoſition to the juſt remonſtrances of the nation; then adding mockery to injury, he boaſts of the lenity of his government, and endeavours to make the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the malcontents paſs for an handful of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded people<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>IT is a maxim in the cabinet, that the injuries offered to the people, if they remain unredreſſed, acquire to the crown the prerogative of offering them new ones. Accordingly, when public grievances are brought before a ſupreme tribunal, the prince makes uſe of every poſſible artifice to prevent its taking cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of them; he attempts to divert therefrom the attention of the judges, by laying before them new objects<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>Hurrying the ſubſidy-bill was the uſual craft of our kings of the houſe of Stuart, every time the parliament took into conſideration national grievances; and to carry that point, they employed every poſſible artifice; they even worked upon the moſt tender paſſions of the human heart, and then turned againſt the legiſlators the nobleneſs of their ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>"In the year 1605, the miniſters of James I. entreated an immediate ſupply to the King's neceſſities. But as the bill for ſubſidies went on 
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0044000700:92"/>heavily in the lower houſe, and the redreſs of grievances was thought very neceſſary to precede the grant; in the heat of debate, an alarm of the King's being murdered at Oking threw the whole houſe into confuſion. The frighted members ſent meſſage after meſſage to the council to know the truth of the various reports. In a little time they became leſs ſtrong, then doubtful, and in ſome hours James ſent word that he intended being in London that day. Whilſt the minds of men were yet agitated by the double ſurprize, whilſt the tide of affection ran yet high on account of the ſuppoſed accident, the courtiers puſhed the ſupply ſo warmly, that notwithſtanding all that the clear-ſighted could do, they carried the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the parliament was ſuddenly prorogued." <hi>Macaul.

                     <p>In 1628, the Commons took the reſolution of granting no ſubſidies to Charles I. until he had redreſſed the national grievances.

At firſt he perſuaded the Lords to prevail upon the Commons to be ſatisfied with a confirmation of Magna Charta, or ſome other conceſſion; he next, in order to fruſtrate the intent of the ſaid petition, wrote to the lower houſe, "That he could not give up the point of committing in matters of ſtate; he promiſed for the future to be very tender of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the people, to commit none for not lending money, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that the cauſes of all commitments ſhould be expoſed as ſoon as they could with ſafety; he then ſent them continual importunate meſſages for engaging them to confide in his word."</p>
                     <p>"When the petition had paſſed both houſes, and the Commons imagined themſelves at the point of receiving the fruit of their labour, they received the following anſwer: <hi>"The King willeth that right be done according to the laws and cuſtoms of the realm, and that the ſtatutes be put in due execution, that the ſubjects will have no cauſe to complain of any wrong or oppreſſion contrary to their juſt rights and liberties, to the proſecution whereof he holds himſelf as much obliged as of his own prerogative."</hi>

               <p>THE ſubjects, to keep themſelves free, have no other means but watchfulneſs, ſpirit and virtue; the Prince, to ſubdue them, has ſo many means that he is embarraſſed only in his choice of them: that, however, which he moſtly makes uſe of is cunning. People are eaſily deceived in many things, and thoſe at the helm take advantage of it.</p>
               <p>When the oppreſſed ſubjects are about taking ſome reſolution in order to oppoſe the progreſs of tyranny, they always meet with ſome obſtacle. Let them form what deſign they pleaſe, the Prince prevents the execution of it immediately. Let them entreat the redreſs of grievances, their petitions are fruitleſs; the Prince alledges his ſcruples, refuſes to comply, and oftentimes returns mockery to their complaints; he anſwers, <hi>"That he is always ready to hear the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of his ſubjects; that he is never ſo much concerned as about the well-being of his people,"</hi> and diſmiſſes them with fair words.</p>
               <p>If the ſubjects perſiſt in their reſolution, the Prince perſiſts in his conduct. Ever applying their minds to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0044000700:97"/>the maxims of a fraudulent policy, thoſe at the helm learn the art of not being diſheartened by difficulties, of taking advantage of the weakneſs of men, of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jolling into acquieſcence the eaſy multitude; and as it is their method, when they mean to prevail over the people, to promiſe them every thing, with a view of performing none; whilſt the malcontents are earneſt in their requeſt, the Prince amuſes their credulity with fair promiſes, and without any ſhame of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his word, repeats this mean artifice.</p>
               <p>In the time of <hi>la Fronde,</hi> public ſafety having been attacked by many arbitrary exiles and impriſonments, the parliament of Paris at laſt obtained from the king a law<note n="*" place="bottom">See an edict of the 22d Oct. 1645.</note> for ſecuring the liberty of the ſubject; but ſoon after this law was infringed in the perſon of Chavigni. When the parliament remonſtrated againſt this infraction, they were anſwered by the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, <hi>"That the impriſonment complained of ought to deter no body, that ſhe paſſed her word for public ſafety, and that her word would be inviolable."</hi> She broke, however, that inviolable word not long after, in reſpect to the Princes of Condé and Conti. The parliament remonſtrated again, and again the Regent
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0044000700:98"/>aſſured them, "<hi>That for the future the law ſhould be ſtrictly obſerved</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. du Card. Mazar. vol. iii. liv. v. chap. 2.</note>." Thus Princes mock the people.</p>
               <p>If incenſed at ſo many falſe promiſes, and weary with ſeeing their hopes ſo many times baffled, the malcontents exclaim loudly for juſtice, the Prince even then attempts to delay; he ſends them deputies to amuſe them, he ſtops the provoked multitude, diverts their fury, or cools it by vain conſultations, till the moment when he can without danger encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>Amidſt the various inſtructions Charles V. delivered to his ſon, he adviſed him "to yield when the tempeſt blows high; not to oppoſe the fury of angry deſtiny; to eſchew thoſe ſtrokes he cannot reſiſt; to beg quarter, and watch a favourable opportunity." <hi>Silhon's Miniſtre d'Etat,</hi> liv. iii. chap. 6.</p>

               <p>If he is forced to treat, he at firſt makes them ſuch offers as he knows will be rejected, next he makes propoſals more reaſonable but expreſſed in a vague manner, calculated to conceal his duplicity, and which binding him to no particular obligations, leaves him always maſter of the terms of accommodation; or he adds to clear conceſſions ſome obſcure clauſe which renders them void, if falſe engagements rather are not taken.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0044000700:100"/>then appear, by what his Majeſty ſhould do, how far he had been from intending and deſigning any of thoſe things which the too great fears and jealouſies of ſome perſons apprehended, and how ready he would be to exceed the greateſt examples of the moſt indulgent Princes in their acts of grace and favour to their people<note n="*" place="bottom">Parliam.

               <p>In the inſurrection of 1647 at Naples, as the people entreated the delivery of the charter of their privileges, the Viceroy, ſolely intent on diſſipating the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtorm, ordered a copy of it to be forged, which he tendered for the original<note n="†" place="bottom">Giannone Hiſt. di Nap.</note>.</p>

                  <p>TO defeat the people, the Prince ſometimes oppoſes to them even their own ſupporters.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering the eſteem of the public for their leaders as deſtructive of his projects, mercenary ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers are engaged for attempting to vindicate the proceedings of adminiſtration, for aſperſing popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, and defaming thoſe who are ſo ſpirited as to oppoſe the villainous attempts of power.

                  <p>As Manlius incited the Romans to ſet themſelves free from the tyranny of the Senate, the Senators had him apprehended; but being obliged to ſet him at
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0044000700:102"/>liberty in order to ſuppreſs the ſedition, they laboured to make him appear odious to the people.

                  <p>When Barnavelt ſet himſelf againſt Maurice of Naſſau, who attempted to aſſume a monarchic power over Holland, Maurice cauſed him to be charged with being the head of the Arminians; and under that pretence had him dragged into a priſon by his ungrateful fellow citizens, and thence to a ſcaffold.</p>
                  <p>Another extraordinary artifice ſometimes made uſe of by Princes, in order to confound the deſigns of the ſubjects, is the ſetting againſt popular leaders ſome

                  <p>THE Prince has a thouſand means for attacking liberty, the ſubjects but few for defending it; and it is not eaſy to imagine how narrow is the way whereon they can walk with ſafety. Whilſt he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits with impunity ſo many outrages upon the laws; they, on the contrary, are ruined by the leaſt fault.

The Prince being then entreated to continue to hold the

                  <p>The French adminiſtration, ſeeing the bad ſtate of the finances, the alienations, even the mortgaging of the crown-lands, was reduced during the diſturbances of <hi>la Fronde,</hi> to have recourſe to new ways of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: but as the people refuſed to pay the taxes, as the provinces were ready to riſe, as the confederates, for want of money, were on the point of breaking

In ſuch junctures the parliament ſtipulated ſomething in favour of public liberty.

                  <p>After the Scots had revolted againſt the oppreſſive government of Charles I. they ſent him, at York, a petition for redreſs of grievances, to which the king anſwered, "That he required the petitioners to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the particulars of their deſires, he having been always ready to redreſs their grievances." But in the mean while he was ſtudious to make a trial of the affection of the Yorkſhire gentlemen, he endeavoured to incenſe them, by falſe inſinuations, againſt the Scots, and attempted to call together the lords of England in order to obtain a ſubſidy. Obliged finally to treat, he ordered his commiſſioners not to ſtipulate
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0044000700:107"/>any important article, he waſted the time in long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries, demanded that both armies ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, or at leaſt reduced, kept ſecret intelligence with the enemy's party by means of the traiterous Montroſe, and concluded not till reduced to the laſt extremity. His perfidious duplicity did not end here. Scarcely had the parliament of England met, but Charles entreated them to declare themſelves againſt the Scots; he ſolemnly aſſured them, that he was reſolved to gain the affection of his Engliſh ſubjects, and promiſed redreſs of national grievances. In fine, all his meaſures proving abortive, he returned to the Scots, laboured to bribe the army, to draw them to London, in order to ſeize the Tower and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of the parliament<note n="*" place="bottom">Ruſhworth, vol. ii. p. 1297.</note>.</p>
                  <p>James II. alarmed at the deſigns of the Prince of Orange, attempted a reconciliation with the Church of England. In a proclamation, he invited his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to lay aſide all prejudices, jealouſies and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; and, in order to regain their affections, he reſtored the biſhop of London to his ſee, and returned to this city the charter of its privileges. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as his fears increaſed, he took, with reluctancy, ſome other ſteps towards the redreſs of grievances, he diſſolved the High Commiſſion Court, ordered the

Thus actuated by neceſſity, he deſtroyed with his own hands the work which himſelf had raiſed, a reform which continued no longer than his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Upon the news of the diſperſion of the Prince's fleet by a tempeſt, he revoked ſome of his acts of grace granted to his ſubjects. The biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter was recalled on ſome frivolous pretence, and the reſtoration of the college deferred. When the Dutch army had landed, the King, having great confidence in the ſuperiority of his own forces, upon hearing that the city of London were preparing to addreſs him for an accommodation with the Prince of Orange, declared publicly, that he would look upon all thoſe as his enemies, who ſhould pretend to give him ſuch advice. But the Prince's troops being joined by a multitude of ſubjects, and ſome lords petitioning him to call a free parliament, he returned anſwer, "That he moſt paſſionately deſired what they aſked, and promiſed, upon the faith of a king, that he would
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0044000700:109"/>have a parliament, and ſuch a one as they aſked for, as ſoon as ever the Prince of Orange had quitted this realm." He then publiſhed a proclamation for calling a free parliament; but repenting his reſolution, he cauſed the writs that were to be iſſued to be burnt, and imagining that it would not be poſſible to call a lawful parliament without his concurrence, he threw the great ſeal into the Thames, that nothing might be done legally in his abſence, then left his dominions to go and implore foreign aſſiſtance againſt his people<note n="*" place="bottom">Tindal.</note>.</p>

               <p>In order to ſubdue his ſubjects, the Prince labours to blind them. Conſcious of the unlawfulneſs of his own deſigns, and ſenſible of what he has to fear from clear-ſighted men, he endeavours to deprive the people of every means of acquiring knowledge.</p>

               <p>When Princes cannot reſtrain the people from freely ſpeaking or writing, they oppoſe error to truth. If any exclaim againſt their outrageous enterprizes, they at firſt endeavour to bribe the clamorous patriots, and to extinguiſh their zeal by gifts, but chiefly by promiſes.</p>
               <p>If the virtue of the patriots be incorruptible, they oppoſe to them proſtituted ſcribblers, who, ever ready to vindicate tyranny, abuſe, from their obſcure cells, the friends of liberty, exert all their malice in blackening the views of the ſupporters of the rights of the people, and cauſing them to be looked upon as diſturbers of the public tranquillity.</p>
               <p>If theſe artifices prove ineffectual, in order to ſilence the protectors of liberty, the moſt horrid expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients are made uſe of—dungeons, ſword, poiſon.</p>

               <p>If the want of a true idea of liberty be a cauſe of ſlavery, the want of a true idea of tyranny is likewiſe a cauſe of it.</p>

                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0044000700:118"/>Hiſtory ought to celebrate only the moderation of Princes, their wiſdom, their ſteadineſs in enforcing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the laws, zeal in promoting public happineſs, and tenderneſs for the people; but it celebrates almoſt always only their magnificent follies, their villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous attempts and their outrages. Hiſtory ought to beſtow encomiums on thoſe Princes alone who are ſtudious of governing the people in peace; but it ſeldom applauds any but Princes ſkilled in the art of deſolating the world.</p>
               <p>Abaſed by fear, ſeduced by hope, or corrupted by avarice, thoſe who write hiſtory inculcate no averſion to abſolute power, excite in us no horror againſt tyranny; they expatiate on the undertakings of a prince, when great or bold, however pernicious they be to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of mankind, and however wickedly ſupported; they beſtow encomiums on deeds for which the voice of all ages ſhould brand with infamy the names of the authors, and baſely inſinuate the maxims of ſlavery<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>I know there are ſome hiſtorians to be excepted, and with pleaſure I claſs the names of a Ralph and a Macaulay with the reſpectable one of Tacitus.</p>

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0044000700:119"/>When they treat of governments, they declaim againſt the popular and extol the monarchical. They repreſent the people in a democracy, <hi>as being ever ready to yield to the ſeditious ſpeeches of orators earneſt in deceiving them for private views, and the ſtate as a ſhip without anchor on a ſtormy ſea, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally toſſed by contrary winds;</hi> whilſt they compare the ſubjects of a powerful monarch, <hi>as a numerous family, which reſts happy under the wings of a good father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When it ſo happens that a province ſhakes off the yoke, they term the inhabitants, <hi>rebels, or revolted ſlaves, who ought to be again put into fetters.</hi> They deſcribe the ſpirited efforts of a people againſt oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as a <hi>rebellion, a guilty revolt,</hi> and the friends of liberty as perturbators of the public peace; they wreſt the views of good patriots, blaſt their reputation, and brand their memory inſtead of reſpecting their virtues<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>All the Spaniſh hiſtorians, who have written of the civil wars of Caſtile, under Charles V. have blaſted the memory of the brave Padillo; and almoſt all the writers who have mentioned the puniſhment of Charles I. have repreſented as barbarous parricides thoſe ſpirited patriots who ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced that tyrant to death.</p>

Whilſt writing the hiſtory of a great villain, although from the mere force of truth, they make now and then ſome diſagreeable conceſſions; they ever ſpeak ſo faintly of his defects, they ſo greatly palliate his vices, ſo artfully extenuate his criminal attempts, that from their deſcriptions no one can diſtinguiſh the tyrant who ſo much diſgraced human nature.</p>
               <p>The miſeries of the people, during any fatal reign, they generally attribute, not to the follies or outrages of thoſe who command, but to the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible influence of deſtiny<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>They never give to things the real names. They term the <hi>art of governing,</hi> that of ſpreading every where terror and deſolation; they call <hi>magnificence</hi> pageantry and odious prodigality; they cover uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0044000700:121"/>under the fair names of <hi>extenſion of power, addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of privileges, and new prerogatives acquired by the crown;</hi> extortions, rapacity, robberies, under that of <hi>conqueſt;</hi> craft, duplicity, treachery, perfidiouſneſs, treaſon, under that of the <hi>art of negociating;</hi> and outrages, murders, poiſoning, under that of <hi>acts of great policy.</hi> Thus they ſucceed in deſtroying that impreſſion of horror, which the bare ſight of thoſe actions ever excites in the ſpectator.</p>
               <p>But as if the falſe pictures offered in hiſtory were not ſufficient, there is every where a multitude of writers who, actuated by their baſe paſſions, are ever ready to vindicate tyranny. Authors in their dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, poets in their verſes, orators in their ſpeeches, every one with emulation baſely offers his incenſe; they give Princes the moſt flattering appellations, they call them <hi>fathers of the people, benefactors of mankind, the glory of the age,</hi> and we are ſo ſilly as to credit them.</p>
               <p>It is not my deſign here to unveil the groſs impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of thoſe writers, it is ſufficiently obvious to readers not prepoſſeſſed; but I ſhall offer a few words on their ignorance or inſincerity in thoſe very encomiums, which even men of ſenſe have credited.</p>
               <p>Popular government is repreſented <hi>by penſioned ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts</hi> as ever ſtormy and unſettled. A people is reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0044000700:122"/>and ſeditious only when leading an idle life, as the Greeks and Romans did; becauſe, for want of private affairs, men are then always prompted to meddle with matters of ſtate: but men, wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in private employments, are unfortunately al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready but too much unconcerned about the affairs of adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>However, let this falſe aſſertion paſs. Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly there are now and then ſome diſturbances in a democratical government; but is there none in ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical and monarchical ones?</p>
               <p>Beſides, theſe diſturbances ariſe leſs from a popular conſtitution than from its corruption; for if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are generally inconſiderate, if they oftentimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves in falſe ſteps, and ſometimes eagerly purſue their miſery, they are likewiſe, when not bribed, always ready to yield to men whoſe virtue and judgment they reſpect. It is the fault of the conſtitution if ſuch men are not conſtantly ſet at the helm, if ſubjects are deprived of the means of being acquainted with their true intereſts, and if any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual is permitted to be powerful enough to bribe a multitude.</p>
               <p>We are told of the frequent factions, ſeditions, and rebellions, in popular governments; but has a people
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0044000700:123"/>ever took arms but to ſecure their liberty, to oppoſe the pernicious deſigns of ambitious men, and to free themſelves from oppreſſion?</p>
               <p>We are terrified at public diſſenſions. From the fires of diſcord, however, all thoſe laws, which were made formerly at Rome in favour of liberty, took their origin; and from the fires of diſcord liberty has ariſen among us.</p>
               <p>Men are too eaſily impoſed upon by the noiſe of civil diſcords. During the long diſturbances which agitated Rome from the Tarquins to the Gracchi, there were but few baniſhments, but few impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and almoſt no blood ſhed; but from thoſe tranquil reigns, which are ſo much boaſted of, let as long a period leſs fertile in tragic ſcenes be pointed out; how many were incomparably more ſo! What miſchiefs were ever cauſed at Rome by the diſſenſions of the Forum, to be compared with the horrors of the calm reigns of Tiberius, Nero, Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula? What evils were ever ſuffered by any people under popular government, to be compared with thoſe we ſuffered under Henry VII. Mary, Charles I. and James II. And that ſo much extolled calm of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical ſtates, what is it, but the ſad ſilence of an unfortunate people, who dare not vent their griefs?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0044000700:124"/>Thus the praiſes beſtowed on governments, where the Prince is too powerful, are ſo many traits which point out their deformity.</p>
               <p>Conqueſts are ever repreſented as the moſt happy events in a reign. But not to ſpeak of thoſe acts of violence and injuſtice which are inſeparable therefrom, what generally are conqueſts, but the ruin of nations, even of conquerors themſelves? How dear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of a new province to the ancient ones? If the pride of a monarch is ſometimes indulged by the glory of being accounted a conqueror, how much is the well-being of the ſubjects leſſened thereby! Let the benefits that a ſtate receives from that vain glory be put in compariſon with the evils it is productive of.</p>
               <p>What did the ambition of a Charles V. avail, but to deſolate Europe, to ruin his ſubjects, to ſee the conquered provinces wreſted from his hands, and to force him at laſt to bury in a monaſtery his grief and ſhame?</p>
               <p>What the ambition of a Philip II. but to kindle war every where, to ſhed torrents of the blood of his ſubjects, to cauſe the ocean to ſwallow up his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fleets, to allow no reſt to his people, to ſquander the immenſe treaſures of Spain and India, to ruin his extenſive dominions, and to bury with himſelf the eclat of his crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0044000700:125"/>What the ambition of a Charles XII. but to carry terror over Europe, to enlarge his empire, to loſe in a few hours the fruits of nine years victories, and to abandon his own dominions to the ſword of the enemy?</p>
               <p>Such are almoſt conſtantly the fruits of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Princes:—a plague the moſt fatal with which Heaven puniſhes thoſe nations that dare not free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therefrom.</p>
               <p>Writers emphatically praiſe the magnificence and liberalities of monarchs; why not rather cenſure thoſe odious prodigalities, which in order that pageantry be diſplayed, and that a few individuals may abound in riches, oblige the greateſt part of the nation to live ſparingly, or linger in miſery. But even were the people the conſtant objects of royal munificence, how is it poſſible to give them much without taking much more from them?</p>
               <p>Writers exhauſt themſelves in praiſing the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of Princes; but can Princes even poſſeſs that virtue? What are gifts which coſt nothing but the trouble of a command?</p>
               <p>That which is gained with difficulty and labour, or deducted from conveniency and neceſſity, when given with diſcernment; that alone, I ſay, is to be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0044000700:126"/>accounted a valuable gift. But let Princes be ever ſo much laviſh of their favours, are they the leſs at eaſe for it? Do they repoſe the leſs on the pillows of luxury? Are they the leſs clad with purple? Is their table the leſs delicate? Are their palaces the leſs magnificent? their groves the leſs volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous?</p>
               <p>When an hungry ſcribbler gets a penſion, all is well; but the oppreſſed multitude groan in ſilence: and whilſt the ſighs of the unhappy ſufferers remain incloſed within the walls of their wretched habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the praiſes given to bad Princes by proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted ſycophants fly through every climate on the wings of Fame.</p>

               <p>Opinion, reflecting the Stoick within himſelf, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds his heart with ice, prevents it from palpitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with joy amidſt pleaſures, from being moved to pity at the hearing of doleful cries, from ſhaking for fear among dangers; it concenters all his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in pride, and, confirming him in his paſſive vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, cauſes him to live without ties, and die without weakneſs.</p>
               <p>Opinion, in a word, obſtructing our ſight with the bandage of ſuperſtition, ſubjects our necks to the yoke of prieſts; and its power Princes make uſe of in order to enchain us.</p>
               <p>If we turn our ſight upon antiquity, we ſhall every where ſee the Prince labouring to make the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects look upon himſelf as upon a favourite of Heaven.

                     <p>Religion ought to contribute to render men good patriots; when it has ſuch a tendency, it is one of the greateſt pillars of liberty; but when it has a contrary one, it is attended with the moſt humiliating ſervitude.</p>

                  <head>CONTINUATION OF THE SAME SUBJECT.</head>
                  <p>EVERY religion countenances deſpotiſm, but none ſo much as the Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of being connected with the political ſyſtem, the Chriſtian religion is univerſal in its principle; it has nothing excluſive, nothing more peculiar to any country than to another; it embraces equally all mankind in its charity, takes away the bar which ſeparates nations, and unites all Chriſtians in a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.—Such is the true ſpirit of the goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Liberty depends on the love of the patria; but the reign of Chriſtians is not of this world; their patria is in heaven, and to them earth is a place of pilgrimage only. How then can a people, longing but for things above, be concerned for things below?</p>
                  <p>All human inſtitutions are grounded on human paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſupported by them only; the love of liberty is united to that of well-being, to that of temporal enjoyments: but the Chriſtian doctrine inſpires us with an averſion for thoſe enjoyments, and is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally combating our terreſtrial inclinations. Wholly engroſſed by another life, men are but little concerned about this.</p>
                  <p>To maintain themſelves free, the people muſt have an eye ever upon government; they muſt watch all
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0044000700:130"/>its motions, oppoſe all its illegal attempts, and curb its audacity. How can men, whom religion prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits being ſuſpicious, be thus watchful; how can they put a ſtop to the ſecret practices of the enemies to liberty, how detect them, how even ſuppoſe that ſuch men exiſt? Without ſuſpicion, without cunning, without wrath, without reſentment, a true chriſtian is at the diſcretion of the firſt who forms an attempt upon him.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirit of the goſpel is a ſpirit of lenity, of charity<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>If religion influenced the Prince as well as the ſubjects, that ſpirit of charity which is the great characteriſtic of a true Chriſtian, would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly mitigate the exerciſe of power; but when we conſider that the leſſons of the Goſpel cannot take root in a heart given up to pleaſure and diſſipation; when we conſider that its precepts cannot reſiſt pernicious maxims con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly repeated, bad examples ever under the eye, temptations ever new, we are made ſenſible that religion cannot rule thoſe who live at court.</p>
                        <p>Some religious Princes have however been ſeen, it will be ſaid. If by religious Princes, bigots, hypocrites, or fanatics, are meant, I agree; and yet theſe were men whoſe youth had been ſpent under the direction of prieſts, men whoſe paſſions were not naturally violent, men whoſe hearts worn out by pleaſures, or brought back by age to the timidity of infancy, cauſed them to be credulous; men, in a word, who, ſeparating morality from the tenets of faith, like the Phariſee, admitted that part of religion only, which indulged their vicious propenſities.</p>

               <p>BUT as if it did not ſuffice, that the ſubjects ſhould learn from the Goſpel to kiſs the rod of power with devotion, in order to render them more ſervile from principle, there is a confederacy between prieſts and Princes. Theſe borrow the tongue of the divine, to ſubject the people to deſpotiſm: the others borrow the arm of the magiſtrate, to ſubject them to ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>Under the Princes of the houſe of Stuart who mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the throne of England, prieſts were inſtructed to teach ſpeculative deſpotiſm, and graft on religious affections ſyſtems of civil tyranny.</p>
               <p>In 1622, orders were given by James I. "That no preacher, of what title or denomination ſoever, from henceforth ſhould preſume in any auditory within this kingdom, to declare, limit or bound out by way of poſitive doctrine, the power, prerogative, and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of ſovereigns, or otherwiſe meddle with matters of ſtate, and the differences between Princes and the people, than as they are inſtructed by precedents in the homilies of obedience."</p>

               <p>A conformity to ſuch doctrines was exacted through the whole kingdom, and diſobedience was liable to be puniſhed by the High-Commiſſion Court, with deprivation, fines, confiſcation, impriſonment, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Any word or writing which tended towards ſchiſm was puniſhed by the Commiſſioners. Theſe inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were not limited to proceed by legal information; rumour, and ſuſpicions were ſufficient grounds.

               <p>When deſpotiſm eſtabliſhes itſelf by ſlow ſteps, the longer it is eſtabliſhed, the leſs it is felt: it at laſt arrives, however, to ſuch a degree as to force the people to open their eyes. Whenever the Prince audaciouſly attacks rights ſacred to all<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>In a ſmall ſlate where the manners of the people are not degenerated, theſe violent outrages of Princes are ever attended with the ruin of their authority.</p>
                     <p>When Tarquin made an attempt upon Lucretia's chaſtity, as he attacked rights ſacred to all the citizens, every one was filled with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at ſuch an outrage, and his power was at an end.</p>
                  </note> mankind; whenever he tramples under foot the objects of public veneration, or exhibits too frequently ſcenes of blood, the minds of men are affected with indignation, ſighs are changed into complaints, a refractory ſpirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails among perſons of all ranks, confuſion begins to reign, and murmurs, clamours, and ſeditious ſpeeches are to be heard every where. Then the authority of government every inſtant diminiſhes, its orders are diſregarded, in theſe moments of confuſion no act ſeems illicit, and the Prince in appearance retains a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0044000700:136"/>vain title only. But how many means ſtill remain to ſupport his overgrown power?</p>
               <p>If the ſubjects, driven to deſpair, at length take a tragic reſolution, it ſeldom avails but to expoſe them. Whilſt the inſurgents loudly crave juſtice, the Prince in his turn vents his complaints againſt them, ſends them deputies, magiſtrates, ſatellites, has the moſt audacious apprehended, treats them as diſturbers of the public peace, and oftentimes the diſorder is hereby ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p>The efforts made by the people for ſecuring their liberty are commonly fruitleſs<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>In almoſt every inſurrection, the populace alone hoſtilities, men of fortune declare for no party at firſt, and are at length only hurried along by the torrent. What is to be expected from the attempts of a rabble? They have never great intereſt for taking arms againſt tyranny, they cannot depend one upon another, and they want ſecrecy. In their fits of reſentment or deſpair, the populace divulge their deſigns, and ever give their enemy time to render them abortive.</p>
                  </note>. When the violent ſymptoms of univerſal diſſatisfaction break out, unleſs the inſurgents be headed by ſome great perſonage, unleſs the meaſures of an unruly and fluctuating mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude be planned by wiſe men, and carried into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſpirited and audacious ones, the inſurrection inſtead of being a revolt, is but a ſedition—ever eaſily ſuppreſſed, and ever unſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0044000700:137"/>But the engaging as a leader of the inſurgents is dangerous; to head a faction is to draw upon oneſelf all the ſtorm; and the uncertainty of the ſucceſs or the apprehenſions of a miſcarriage, always reſtrain the moſt reſolute<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>How eaſily did thoſe who were maſters of the commonwealth render abortive the deſigns the Gracchi had formed of ſetting the plebeians free from oppreſſion. If it proved ſo eaſy to ruin theſe protectors of the people notwithſtanding their tribunitial power, how much eaſier is it to ruin a popular leader, who having no public character, may always be treated as a diſturber of the public tranquillity.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Beſides, how difficult oftentimes to excite a people to take up arms! When Manlius endeavoured to free the Romans from the oppreſſion of the ſenate, full of zeal as long as danger was remote, they diſplayed the greateſt audacity; but no ſooner was Manlius apprehended and brought before the dictator, but they loſt all reſolution. In vain did this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate leader entreat their aſſiſtance; neither the ſight of thoſe wounds he had received for the ſake of their country, neither the view of the capitol he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, neither reverence for thoſe temples which he had prevented being prophaned, nor piety for the gods, moved them; they remained inactive ſpectators, and beheld calmly their chief dragged into a dungeon.</p>
               <p>If much is ever wanting to excite an inſurrection, very little is commonly wanted to ſuppreſs it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0044000700:138"/>When the Sicilians, weary of groaning under the oppreſſive domination of the viceroy Los Velos, had revolted; the inhabitants of Palermo placed at their head one Alexis; but terrified by the warlike prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Spain, they baſely attempted to purchaſe their pardon by murdering their captain.</p>
               <p>On the day of the firſt <hi>Barricades,</hi> as the populace flocked together to ſurround the hotel of the preſident Molé,—a traitor to his country, and prepared to break open his doors; Molé himſelf immediately had them opened, and without emotion appeared before the inſurgents. Amazed at this bold ſtep, they retired without noiſe, and ſuffered themſelves to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. du Cardin. Mazarin.</note>.</p>
               <p>He muſt be very little acquainted with hiſtory who knows no inſtance of ſuch want of courage in almoſt every revolt.</p>
               <p>When ſubjects prove ſo little reſolute, the Prince diſregards their clamours, or rather ſilences their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints by perſiſting in the ſame conduct which raiſed them; and their reſentment exhales in vain murmurs.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the ſubjects want not reſolution, their riſing avails little, unleſs it be general. When a city takes arms to defend its privileges, if its example is not followed by the reſt of the nation, mercenary
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0044000700:139"/>troops ſubdue it, the Prince treats the inhabitants as rebels, and they feel their yoke lay heavier upon them<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Powerful, noble, and wealthy men, new men who owe their fortune to the Prince, ambitious men who look upon a court as the only ſource of dignities, wretches who ſeek their fortune amidſt public diſorders, prieſts, academicians, pedants, and that proſtituted herd that ſubſiſts by the extravagancies and vices of the great, all generally ſtick to the party of the court: whilſt men of a middle rank, ſenſible and wiſe men, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſouls who will obey the laws only, and elevated minds who ſcorn ſervility, eſpouſe the cauſe of liberty.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the inſurrection be general, yet how ſeldom is there any union between the ſubjects? Commonly the people is divided into many parties, and this want of union is one of the greateſt reſources of tyranny. The Prince then counterballances the reſpective forces of the different parties by each other, he equally avails himſelf of their weakneſs and jealouſies, and cruſhes them with their own hands.</p>
               <p>If the people is not divided into factions, it is the craft of adminiſtration to ſow diſcord among them, and foment diſſention.</p>
               <p>When the repreſentatives of the people of Venice uſurped the ſupreme authority, as the moſt powerful families were divided between empire and ſervitude, and this uſurpation had raiſed a ſpirit of univerſal diſſatisfaction, to diſunite the malcontents, the uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0044000700:140"/>opened anew the door of the council to ſeveral families that had been ſhut out, reſtrained many others by hope, and then audaciouſly faced the reſt.</p>
               <p>When the Caſtilians took arms to vindicate their rights violated by their deputies in the Cortes aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Gallicia, and to obtain ſatisfaction for the outrages committed by the Flemiſh miniſters, Charles V. with a view of dividing the malcontents, iſſued circular letters to all the cities of Caſtile that had revolted, exhorting them in moſt gentle terms to lay down their arms, publiſhed a general amneſty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſuch cities as had continued faithful, or ſhould return to obedience, not to exact from them the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy granted in the late Cortes, and engaged that no office of government ſhould be conferred for the future upon foreigners. On the other hand, he wrote to the nobles, exciting them to appear with vigour in defence of their own rights, againſt the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant claims of the people, and inſtigating them, by a mean jealouſy of that ſpirit of independance which they ſaw riſing among the commons, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the prerogative of the crown<note n="*" place="bottom">Sandov.

For although the ſubjects be all united againſt tyranny, all have not the ſame views. Every claſs among them has peculiar claims, the ſeveral provinces, even the towns of the ſame province have peculiar intereſts.

               <p>Subjects, though united againſt tyranny, agree very ſeldom in the choice of a chief; but what is more ſurpriſing, that which ought to render them unanimous, ſerves oftentimes to ſet them at variance; and this want of harmony ever ruins the intereſts of the people<note n="‡" place="bottom">

               <p>Charles IX. of France, by inceſſantly perſecuting his proteſtant ſubjects, forced them to revolt: as their party encreaſed every day, and terrified the tyrant, too puſillanimous to encounter the inſurgents at the head of his army, he took the reſolution of exterminating them any way, and meditated this horrid project for two years. Having at laſt fixed on the meaſures to carry it into execution, he concluded with them a fraudulent peace, amuſed their chiefs by falſe careſſes, neglected no pains to lull them into a fatal ſecurity, and had them, with ſixty thouſand of their adherents, murdered on the night of St. Bartholomew.</p>

When once the moment which was to fix fortune is let ſlip, all is loſt; the enemy has time for recovering from his fears, and preparing himſelf againſt the intended ſtroke; and, even in theſe critical moments, the party of tyranny has great advantage over the party of liberty.</p>

               <p>King John, being obliged by his Barons to ſign Magna Charta, concealed his reſentment till he had found a favourable juncture for annulling his conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0044000700:150"/>The better to deceive the people, he publicly declared that his adminiſtration was henceforth to run in ſuch a tenor as to give his people no cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, he ſent writs to all his ſheriffs, ordering them to conſtrain every one to ſwear obedience to the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five Barons appointed to ſecure the execution of the ſeveral articles of the great Charter, and then retired into the iſle of Wight to plan the meaſures of a fatal ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: from his retreat he ſecretly ſent abroad his emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to enliſt foreign ſoldiers, and to invite the rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Brabançons into his ſervice by the proſpect of ſharing the ſpoils of England: he diſpatched a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to Rome in order to be abſolved from all his oaths of maintaining the liberties granted to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.

               <p>Edward I. on his return to England from his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into France againſt Philip, being requeſted to ratify ſolemnly the confirmation of the charters to which he had affixed his ſeal, evaded as long as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible:

But after ſo many ſolemn engagements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, whilſt he could not give full ſcope to his ambition, and whilſt his ſubjects flattered themſelves with having ſecured their liberties, he applied to Rome, and procured an abſolution from all his oaths.</p>
               <p>Charles I. having given his aſſent to the petition of rights, repaired in haſte to parliament, and proteſted that he had not intended to give away the profit of tonnage and poundage; ordered this proteſt to be entered in the Journal of the Commons; and again proceeded to ſeize the goods of merchants for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the arbitrary impoſition of tonnage and pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. In the next ſeſſion, he ended his ſpeech by blaming the Commons for enquiring into the infrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the petition of rights, and engaged the Speaker to interrupt all debates on the ſubject. Not ſatisfied with this, and incenſed that parliament had circumſcribed royal power within ſo narrow limits, he reſolved to overthrow them, and to accompliſh his deſign, employed the meaneſt artifices.

To accompliſh this, he at firſt ſtrove to outvie the parliament in courteſy towards the Scots; he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded every motion which had been made in their favour; every thing that they demanded for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their civil rights was granted them: he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards endeavoured to corrupt their army.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0044000700:153"/>themſelves bribed. He then ſet out for Scotland, attempted in his journey to engage the army to prove refractory, ſecured a ſtrong party in the Scotch parliament by the intrigues of his creatures, and laboured to induce the Iriſh catholics to riſe againſt England.</p>
               <p>Charles II. under colour that there were many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators againſt him, and that there were men who, under pretence that the parliament was at an end by virtue of ſome clauſe in the triennial bill, fancied they might aſſemble themſelves to chuſe new members, deſired the parliament held in 1663, not to leave an act in being which was ſuch a diſgrace to the crown, and they baſely complied with his requeſt.</p>
               <p>What a trifling cauſe ſometimes ſuffices to give thoſe at the helm an opportunity for repealing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, and again aſſuming the power into their hands!</p>
               <p>Whilſt M. AEmilius and Q. Fabius laid waſte the enemies lands, the tribunes M. Furius and Cn. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, in order to make the Agrarian laws paſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to levy the tribute, and incited the people to riſe. But although the army, buſy without, was in want of every thing, and the ſenate dreaded a revolt within, the people at that juncture, in appearance ſo favourable to their claims, obtained only that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular-tribune

But while the people reſigned themſelves to joy, and boaſted of their victory, the ſenate was taking ſteps to deprive them of the advantage of it<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>After their victory, the multitude ever abandon themſelves to ſecurity, whilſt they ought to be never more watchful. What terrible attacks could be made then upon liberty! The ſituation of a people, jealous of their rights, is extremely embarraſſing: ſince by a fatality attached to their ſtation, all is againſt them; diſheartened by defeat, ſupine in victory, they have no leſs to fear from good than from bad fortune.</p>
                  </note>. At firſt, it engaged ſome of the moſt illuſtrious patricians to ſet up as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates, expecting that the people would not be ſo daring as to except againſt them; afterwards, exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their utmoſt efforts to carry on that ſcheme, they vented clamours againſt the paſt <hi>comitia,</hi> they ſaid the gods were incenſed that the magiſtracies had been proſtituted by rendering them vulgar, and alledged in proof, the ſharpneſs of winter that had juſt been felt, and the plague which raged over the city and the fields.

                  <p>WHEN the cabinet is compoſed of powerful men, rivalſhip, jealouſy, pique, and ambition, oftentimes incite them to traverſe each others projects, and make them miſcarry. When it is compoſed of many members, the various turn of their minds generally ſets them at variance, reſpecting deſigns and the means of execution. Hence Princes, impatient to attain abſolute power, have always compoſed their cabinet of few men, and men of new families. Such was the craft of Ferdinand of Arragon, of Philip II. Louis XI. Henry VII. Henry VIII. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Some Princes, by a refinement of policy, have even laid down a fixed plan of operations.</p>
                  <p>It was the purſuit of the ſame projects during the reigns of Louis XIII. and Louis XIV. that ſo much increaſed the power of the crown: for Mazarine punctually followed the maxims of Richelieu, and le Tellier thoſe of Mazarine.</p>

As he cannot ſatisfy all ambitious men, thoſe who are admitted into the cabinet are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently oppoſed by thoſe who ſeek to ſet themſelves in their place. As the deſigns of the King ſo much the leſs ſucceed, as his party is the more openly attacked, he is oftentimes obliged to truſt the conduct of affairs to thoſe who have moſt offended him, and to diſmiſs thoſe who have ſerved him beſt. In fine, as his favour is limited, and his hatred impotent, new parties ever ſpring up. Happy diſcord! which ſupplies the want of the virtues among us, and like them ſupports liberty.</p>

                     <p>It is a conſtant cuſtom to give Monarchs the title of Sovereigns. All, even our beſt authors, have fallen into this error; the parliament itſelf—the repreſentative of the real Sovereign, has blindly followed this practice.</p>

               <p>How frequently have been, and ſtill are, ſuch arts employed among us, to corrupt parliament!

               <p>THE Prince, when his deſigns prove abortive, loſes only his time; but when the efforts of the ſubjects to ſhake off their yoke prove unſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they generally loſe the means of making a new attempt.</p>

                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0044000700:163"/>After Princes have plunged their dominions into the calamities of civil war, inſtead of reforming their adminiſtration, and regaining the affections of their injured people, they think only how to ſuppreſs their complaints, and render their efforts fruitleſs: They cannot renounce that ſupreme power, that boundleſs authority, that abſolute empire, which has already coſt them ſo many efforts, ſo many crimes.</p>
               <p>From experience, they learn how to prevent inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. In the beginning of a ſtorm, the miſchief is not diſcovered: when it blows with fury, the remedy is not perceived. Thus they have their eyes ever open on the ſlighteſt commotions, careful to appeaſe them as ſoon as raiſed.</p>
               <p>Not ſatisfied with this, they oftentimes are intent to extirpate the ſeeds of them. Under colour of ſecuring public tranquillity, they forbid all routs, conventicles, clandeſtine meetings, and tumultuous aſſemblies: Some, even by a more refined craft, will not allow any perſons to crowd about popular men, and are ſo wary as to make away with thoſe who are the darlings of the people.</p>
               <p>On his return to Paris, J. J. Rouſſeau uſed to paſs a few moments at a coffee-houſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Le Caffé de la Regence.</note> in his neighbourhood;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0044000700:164"/>but as his preſence attracted great crowds of curious people, he was forbid by the lieutenant of the police to frequent any coffee-houſe.</p>
               <p>The watermen at Venice quarrelling one day with the populace, they came to blows. As the magiſtrates could not ſuppreſs the diſorder, a patrician of the houſe of Lauredano interpoſed, and the mutineers yielded to his entreaties; but the inquiſitors of ſtate, dreading the great influence of this nobleman over the people, diſpatched him ſecretly<note n="†" place="bottom">Amelot de la Houſſaye, Governement de Venice, tom. ii.

               <p>Nay, in order to obviate all inſurrection, it is the craft of thoſe who rule at Venice, to perſecute till death the perſons they have once injured; and that the friends of theſe unfortunate perſons, or ſuch as have eſcaped from their hands, might not conſpire, the Council of the Ten iſſues out from time to time certain proclamations<note n="‡" place="bottom">

               <p>POWER now advances by rapid ſteps towards deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm. The Prince, on the point of making any bold attempt, prepares his engines. If he can do
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0044000700:169"/>without the legiſlature, he carefully abſtains from aſſembling them; if their concurrence is abſolutely neceſſary, he again employs his former arts to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence them, and by bribes, promiſes, threats, ſecures a ſtrong party; when ſecured, he ventures to aſſemble this pretended ſovereign, and makes it reſolve what he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>The ſubjects, wholly engaged with their private affairs, or careleſs of public intereſts, take no notice of the blind devotion of the ſenate to the court, and the Prince continues with eagerneſs to urge on the execution of his deſigns. Yet if any one ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to open the eyes of the public, the miniſtry, under pretence of maintaining good order, perſecute this zealous patriot; then confounding the cauſe of the crown with that of the laws, they charge him with refractory proceedings, and have him puniſhed as a diſturber of the public peace.</p>
               <p>If the public open their eyes and complain, they are amuſed by frivolous objects, calculated only to fix unquiet minds, or their attention is engaged by a politic war.</p>
               <p>Under colour of ſecuring national intereſts, or vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the glory of the ſtate, the Prince arraigns a neighbouring power, demands ſubſidies from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

                     <p>It was in order to make away with troubleſome ſubjects, not to ſtop the progreſs of Philip, that Henry III. of France ſent, in 1589, a fleet to the Terceres, and an army to the Duke d'Alençon.</p>

               <p>Attentive to what paſſes out of the ſtate, the people perceive not what paſſes within, and the Prince conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to enlarge the boundaries of prerogative, or rather to uſurp power.</p>
               <p>To carry on the war, new ſubſidies are demanded, a part of which are carefully laid by.</p>

               <p>During the courſe of a long government, liberty is deſtroyed by gradual alterations, and is ever recovered by violent efforts only: but the Prince takes ſuch cautious meaſures that, once ſubdued, the ſubjects may never be enabled to break their yoke again. Under pretence of ſecuring the ſafety of the realm, he undertakes to become abſolute maſter of it. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly

                     </p>
                     <p>In France, every province is thick ſet with ſtrong places, and there is no conſiderable town without a citadel. Almoſt all other countries in Europe exhibit the ſame ſcene. Fortanately we are an exception, and how carefully is this advantage to be preſerved! As long as adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall conſine their projects to have ſtrong places conſtructed on the ſea-coaſts, let them carry them into execution undiſturbed: but from the inſtant they ſhall attempt, under any pretence whatſoever, to have any fortreſs or citadel built in the interior part of the kingdom, we are undone, unleſs a national oppoſition enſues.</p>

               <p>IN order that thoſe men who are placed at the head of the troops, might ſupport the overgrown power of the crown, and not controul it, Princes are not ſatisfied with having ſuppreſſed every military office of too great influence, but divide the army into many ſmall bodies, among which they incite jealouſy
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0044000700:174"/>by means of peculiar diſtinctions. The command of theſe ſmall bodies they confer on devoted men alone, and the better to ſecure their fidelity, they eſtabliſh in every body ſeveral degrees of command, which officers are promoted to ſlowly by rotation, and rapidly by preferment. Hence every ſubaltern officer not only conſiders him who fills the next ſuperior degree to his own as an obſtacle to advancement, and looks upon him with a jealous eye: but the moſt ambitious among them ſeek to riſe by fawning adulations, vile ſervices, and aſſiduity in courting the Prince; whilſt thoſe who are raiſed labour to ſecure favour by a blind devotion to his commands.</p>
               <p>In regard to the high military offices, great care is taken not to confer them on any darling of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and never to join them to any civil office. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt is ſometimes carried ſo far as to place at the head of the army ſoldiers of fortune only, to change fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the general officers, to incite between them competition, to ſet inſpectors over them, and never to allow the troops to be long ſtationed in the ſame place<note n="*" place="bottom">Such is the craft of the Venetians.</note>.</p>
               <p>When the Prince diſpenſes with commanding the army in perſon; in order to truſt the command with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger into other hands, he gives it to ſeveral,

               <p>AS the military are the inſtruments deſtined to enlarge the Prince's authority, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to act againſt the people in a favourable juncture, they are ſeparated from them<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>I am not ignorant of what has been alledged againſt the quartering of ſoldiers upon free ſubjects; but however grievous a burthen it may be to have ſuch vicious gueſts, I am far from aſſenting to the common opinion. The nuiſance complained of may be removed by enacting ſevere laws againſt the encroachments and violences of ſoldiers, by not authorizing them to demand for their groat a day more than is in the power of the landlord to afford, by commiſſioning civil officers alone to billot them, and by enforcing them to do it in an impartial manner. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0044000700:177"/>to lodge the military in barracks, is at once to diveſt them of that little humanity which they pick up by converſing with the honeſt part of the world, to corrupt them the more by their abandoned inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and to qualify them for a military government. In the firſt caſe, the evil is accidental, but is unavoidable in the laſt; and ſince, from the criminal ambition of Princes, we are to undergo one or the other under pretence of common ſafety, let us ſubmit to the leaſt of them.</p>
                     <p>When, in the reign of William III. adminiſtration induced the commons to enact a law for quartering of ſoldiers either in public or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſes, they knew not how favourable it would prove to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to crowd ſoldiers together in barracks: but this they have ſince learned from other powers. An attempt is now making to ſeparate the ſoldiery from the people. Already troopers, under pretence of keeping them near their riding houſes, are quartered in a ſort of obſcure barracks, till they may be quartered in proper ones; the progreſs is ſlow, but God forbid we ſhould behold ſuch eſtabliſhments with indifference.</p>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0044000700:176"/>
                  </note>, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in barracks; and afterwards inſpired with contempt for every profeſſion except their own. But to render them conſcious of their pre-eminence, many
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0044000700:177"/>marks of diſtinction are conferred on them<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>In Ruſſia every body is obliged to yield the precedency to military men. At Berlin the ſame regard is paid to a detachment of ſoldiers paſſing in the ſtreets, as in Catholic countries to the viaticum.</p>
                     <p>In France, the ſoldier looks upon the burgeſſes with contempt, and believes himſelf privileged to inſult them: the officer diſdains merchants, men of letters, and magiſtrates: the nobility <hi>de l'Epée,</hi> as they are called, deſpiſe the nobility <hi>de la Robe.</hi> So likewiſe in Spain, Portugal, Ruſſia, Denmark, Sweden, &amp;c. and in all theſe countries every ſentinel has a ſcandalous prerogative to waſh away the leaſt affront with the blood of ſubjects.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LVI.</hi> Of Uſury, Exactions, and Extortions.</head>
               <p>IT is a favourite maxim with the cabinet, that if the people are too rich, or even too much at eaſe, it will prove impoſſible to keep them ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; whilſt men rendered dependent by their wants, deſtitute of the means of oppoſing reſiſtance, and aſhamed of their poverty, are conſcious of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and much more diſpoſed to obey<note n="†" place="bottom">See the Political Teſtament of the Cardinal of Richelieu.</note>. Hence, far from releaſing the people, Princes ever charge them with heavy taxes. But as if this did not ſuffice, among the various means they have recourſe to, in order to impoveriſh their ſubjects, uſury, exactions, and extortions are oftentimes made uſe of.</p>
               <p>The Roman ſenate, not ſatisfied with levying the taxes, diſpoſing of the public money, and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating to themſelves the lands of the vanquiſhed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, uſed to prey on the plebeians by uſury.</p>
               <p>Such was the craft of the antients, that of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns is much more refined: they borrow at large intereſt the money of the public; and theſe depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tums of the fortunes of the ſubjects, like chains, tie the people two ways. On one ſide, they are a badge
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0044000700:179"/>of ſubjection, the ſubjects being ever afraid to furniſh a pretence for forfeiture from attempting to revolt: on the other ſide, they are arms in the hands of the Prince which enable him to cruſh thoſe who have truſted him therewith.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when a favourable juncture offers, the Prince, either by retaining the intereſt for a long time, repaying the capital when the value of money is below par, or even by retaining the capital itſelf, reduces, by a ſingle ſtroke, his ſubjects to that point of miſery which they could not have been reduced to but gradually, by purſuing the former plan.</p>
               <p>In theſe points of view, public funds truſted to government in France, Spain, the kingdom of Naples, &amp;c. are to be conſidered.—A truth which thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have but too often ſadly experienced.</p>
               <p>In England ſuch ſteps have never been taken, and perhaps never will; yet public loans bind us not the leſs ſtrongly: for by their means the government has intertwined itſelf with the property of the people, in ſuch a manner that it is impoſſible to lay the ax to the root of the former without deſtroying the latter.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the government becomes debtor, thoſe who are creditors, made ſenſible that the ſums intruſted are loſt if government ſecurities fail, are ever ready to ſubſcribe freſh ones, in order to furniſh it with
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0044000700:180"/>means for defending them. And this newly raiſed money may be employed for a different purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If to ſecure a fund for the payment of intereſt, any regulation deſtructive of liberty ſhould be thought abſolutely neceſſary, the party concerned, that is, that part of the nation which is the moſt regarded, would conſent to it, rather than run the riſk of being ruined by a ſtate bankruptcy. If any one ſhould treat this as a chimerical ſuppoſition, let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the exciſe laws. Moreover, as by the negociation of loans, and the creation or management of funds, the intereſt of moneyed men is intimately connected with that of the court; not only the factors for admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration and thoſe dealers in the funds, who, for the ſake of a lucrative ſhare in ſome contract, are under miniſterial influence, turn courtiers, and cringe at levees, procure themſelves ſeats in parliament, and aſſiſt the Prince to enſlave their country; but the locuſt tribe of ſubſcribers, brokers, ticket-mongers, and all thoſe who act or ſeek to act that dirty part, on all occaſions appear the avowed advocates of every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt miniſter, induce the timid, the weak, the fickle, the ſordid, and the indolent, to follow their example, furniſh their patron with a pretence to urge in excuſe of his miſconduct, raiſes their clamours againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of true patriots, ſmother the voice of the nation,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0044000700:181"/>and become a dangerous faction in ſupport of tyranny.</p>
               <p>Nor are even theſe the worſt meaſures that are planned by ſome Princes to ruin the people.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, in order to impoveriſh their ſubjects and enrich themſelves, they debaſe the coin, that is, reduce its intrinſic value without altering its current one.</p>
               <p>At other times, they prey upon the ſubjects by the moſt flagrant extortions; they even commit them to priſon, in order to oblige them to recover their liberty by paying heavy ranſoms.</p>
               <p>Thus having induced their ſubjects to contract many wants by encouraging luxury, it is the craft of Princes to deprive them afterwards of the means of indulging them, or rather to drive them from depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to ſervitude.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LVII.</hi> To undermine the Supreme Authority.</head>
               <p>THE Prince, having ſecured the army, now labours to ſecure the legiſlature, or to render its power vain. When on the point of making any bold attempt, if he can do without the concurrence of the repreſentatives of the ſovereign, he carefully abſtains from calling them together. If their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence is abſolutely neceſſary, they are not ſuffered to proceed to any other tranſaction, but that for which they have been aſſembled.</p>
               <p>Charles V. having ſummoned the cortes of Caſtile to meet at Compoſtella, engaged them to grant him a ſubſidy. With this grant, the cortes laid before the king a repreſentation of thoſe grievances whereof his people craved redreſs; but he having obtained from them all that he could expect, paid no attention to their petition<note n="*" place="bottom">Sandoval. 84.</note>.</p>
               <p>Such was the practice of Charles I. When he was in want of money, he aſſembled parliament, and hurried the bill for ſubſidies: then to prevent them from taking cognizance of the public grievances, he lulled them into ſecurity by fair promiſes, aſſured
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0044000700:183"/>them that he would be ever careful to preſerve the liberties of his people; engaged the ſpeaker to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt every debate foreign to the bill for ſubſidy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled out of the houſe the warmeſt patriots, by inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitating them from ſerving as repreſentatives, or prorogued, if not diſſolved the parliament.</p>
               <p>To accompliſh their deſigns, Princes ſometimes again put in practice their former arts, they corrupt the legiſlature, and make it ſpeak as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>At other times they terrify the party in oppoſition by threats, or they have the regiſter of the votes altered.</p>
               <p>It was by terror that Henry VIII. kept the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſubmiſſive to his will. The members, free only in the ſenate, were, as ſoon as the ſeſſions was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued, left defenceleſs to the mercy of this tyrant.</p>
               <p>Charles I. intending to have an act paſſed in the parliament of Scotland, for the reſumption of thoſe church lands and titles, which had been alienated in the minority of the former reign, was careful to be preſent at the debate. But meeting with a great oppoſition, he pulled out of his pocket a liſt of all the members that compoſed the houſe, adding, "Gentlemen, I have all your names on this paper, and I will know who will do me ſervice, and who will not, this day." Notwithſtanding the king's
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0044000700:184"/>threatenings, the bill was rejected by the majority; but the clerk of the regiſter, who gathered the votes, removed this difficulty by declaring that it was carried in the affirmative<note n="*" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. i. p. 21.</note>.</p>
               <p>Princes, in order to influence at will the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body, oftentimes endeavour to procure a choice of repreſentatives favourable to their deſigns. Thus Henry VIII. and Mary, when they deſired to carry any important point, uſed to write circular letters to the lord lieutenants in the counties, directing a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per choice of members<note n="†" place="bottom">Mem. of Cramm. p. 344.</note>.</p>
               <p>Actuated by the ſame views, James II. artfully reſumed the charters of all corporations in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and granted them new ones, drawn up in ſuch a form that it was in a manner left to the king to nominate the repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>If this ſuffices not, Princes have ſometimes recourſe to another method. They ſuffer none to fit in the ſenate but thoſe who are known to have no virtue, after having excluded all others who are ſuſpected to have any.</p>
               <p>In the exigencies of affairs in 1656, a parliament was ſummoned, but Cromwell finding that the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the members returned would be unfavourable to his intereſts, placed guards at the doors of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0044000700:185"/>houſe; and, under pretence of excluding men of corrupted principles, permitted none to enter but ſuch as produced a warrant from his council.</p>
               <p>Some Princes, in order that the legiſlature ſhould be entirely at their diſpoſal, have even by violence altered the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>In 1539, Charles V. demanded extraordinary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies from the cortes of Caſtile; but having vainly employed entreaties, promiſes, and threats, in order to obtain his demand, he diſmiſſed the aſſembly with indignation, and excluded out of theſe aſſemblies the nobles and prelates, under pretence that ſuch as pay no part of the public taxes had no vote to claim in laying them on. Hence none were admitted to the cortes but the deputies of the towns, who being in too ſmall a number, and too feeble to oppoſe the king, were all at his devotion<note n="*" place="bottom">Sandoval. Hiſt. vol. ii. p. 269.</note>.</p>
               <p>Other Princes have divided the legiſlative body, and made the proſtituted part paſs for the whole.</p>
               <p>During our civil war of 1641, Charles I. in order to abate the veneration paid to the patriotic repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, and avail himſelf of the name of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with a view of levying the ſums which were neceſſary to carry on the war, ſummoned the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Oxford; and having collected there all the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0044000700:186"/>members of either houſe, who adhered to his intereſts, he endeavoured to inſinuate, that the two houſes ſitting at Weſtminſter were not a legal convention, attempted to prevail with the earl of Eſſex, general of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to treat with thoſe proſcripts, and engaged that proſtituted aſſembly to paſs ſeveral acts, to grant him ſubſidies, and to declare the faithful members guilty of high treaſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Huſband's Collections.</note>.</p>
               <p>The Prince, by engaging the legiſlature to yield conſtantly to his will, and having hereby abaſed them, has no more recourſe to craft; he aſſumes the ſtile of a maſter, and if he ſtill continues to aſſemble them, it is only to give law.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LVIII.</hi> To uſurp Supreme Power.</head>
               <p>ARRIVED to this point, Princes eagerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate their iniquitous deſigns. Earneſt to ſee the people their ſlaves, to reduce them to ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, they oftentimes turn againſt them the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itſelf.</p>
               <p>In a government wherein the activity of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power depends on the will of the executive one,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0044000700:187"/>the legiſlature never can appear but when the Prince gives his orders, and never anſwer but when he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates them: in order, therefore, to annihilate their power, they are no longer called together. When once the legiſlature are ſunk into oblivion, the Prince imperceptibly uſurps their functions: he ventures to iſſue, by his own authority, ſome ordinances, at firſt on trifling objects, afterwards on objects more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; he then by degrees repeats this practice, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms the people to that uſurpation of authority, and at length finds himſelf inveſted with the power of enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laws.</p>
               <p>Thus the kings of France have uſurped ſovereignty. At the origin of that monarchy, royal prerogative was limited to the executive power; the ſupreme power reſided in the general aſſemblies<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe aſſemblies were denominated <hi>Champs de Mars</hi> or <hi>de May.</hi> See Paſquier, Mezeray, le Pere Daniel, &amp;c.</note> of the nation, which met annually at ſtated ſeaſons, and in which every freeman had a right<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>The antient annals of the Francs deſcribe the perſons who were preſent at the aſſembly held A.

                     <p>The capitularia, that is, the laws enacted in thoſe aſſemblies, were relating the one to political, the other to oeconomical, many to eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, and ſome to civil government. See the Capitular. collected by Baluze.</p>
                     <p>In the Capitulare, A. D. 877, the oath Louis the Stammerer took at his coronation, begins thus, "Louis par la miſéricorde de Dieu et l'election du peuple, je promets," &amp;c.</p>
                  </note>, in a word, whatever related to the general welfare of the nation, was ſubmitted to their deliberation, and determined by their ſuffrages<note n="†" place="bottom">Amoinus de Geſtis Francor. lib. iv. Bouquet Recueil, iii. 116, &amp;c.</note>: the King having only a right to give his aſſent to the public reſolutions, and none to refuſe it<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Capitular. of Charles the Bald, A. D. 822, and 857.</note>. Such was the French government under the monarchs of the firſt race.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the power and ſplendor which Charlemagne added to the crown by his conqueſts, the general aſſemblies of the nation continued to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs extenſive authority, under the kings of the ſecond race. They determined which of the royal family ſhould be placed on the throne: the Prince elected, conſulted them regularly with reſpect to every affair of importance to the ſtate, and without their conſent no law was paſſed, and no new tax levied.</p>
               <p>Under the degenerate poſterity of Charlemagne, royal authority was reduced almoſt to nothing. Every
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0044000700:189"/>baron had formed his lands into a ſmall ſtate almoſt independent of the king. The kingdom being thus broken into ſo many ſmall diſtricts, every one of which acknowledged a diſtinct lord, was governed by local cuſtoms, and purſued ſeparate intereſts, hardly any common principle of union remained. Hence the general aſſemblies ſcarcely conſidering the nation as forming one body, could no longer enact common laws; and thus part of the legiſlative power was left inactive.</p>
               <p>Under the deſcendants of Hugh Capet, the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of theſe aſſemblies extended no further than to the impoſition of new taxes, the determination of the ſucceſſor to the crown, and the ſettling the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, when the preceeding monarch had not fixed it by his will.</p>
               <p>It was left to the king to ſummon the national aſſemblies; but as the ordinary charges of government were ſupported by the crown demeſns, he called them together but ſeldom, and only when he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by his wants or his fears to have recourſe to their aid. Thus the obligation of ſummoning them regularly forming no eſſential point of the conſtitution, in order to render their power null, the Prince artfully avoided aſſembling them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0044000700:190"/>When the functions of this power had been a long while ſuſpended, the kings aſſumed them, but ventured at firſt on acts of legiſlation with great reſerve, and took every precaution that could prevent the people from being alarmed at the exerciſe of a new power. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing their authority as much as they could, they began to iſſue their ordinances, not in a tone of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand but of requeſt; they appeared to treat with their ſubjects, they pointed out what was beſt, and allured them to comply with it.</p>
               <p>As the power of the crown extended, this humble ſtile gave place to an imperious tone; and in the beginning of the fifteenth century the king openly aſſumed the ſtile of a law-giver.</p>
               <p>The laſt of the Capitularia collected by Baluze, was iſſued in the year 921, under Charles the Simple. In the middle of the eleventh century, were publiſhed ſome royal ordinances, contained in the collection of Lauriére; but the firſt ordinance extending to the whole kingdom, and being, properly ſpeaking, an act of legiſlation, is that of Philip Auguſtus, iſſued in the year 1190. The eſtabliſhments of St. Louis were not publiſhed as general laws to the whole kingdom, but as a code of laws, to be of authority within the crown domains only. The veneration of the people for this Prince procured this code a favourable recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0044000700:191"/>throughout the whole kingdom, and contributed not a little to reconcile the nation to the uſurpation of the legiſlative authority. The people, accuſtomed to ſee their monarch, by his private authority, iſſue ordinances in points of the greateſt importance, were not ſurpriſed when they ſaw him iſſue them for levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſidies for the ſupport of the government. When Charles VII. and Louis XI. firſt ventured to exerciſe this new power, the minds of the people were ſo well prepared by the gradual incroachments of the crown, that it ſcarce gave riſe to any murmur.</p>
               <p>In proportion as kings continued to exerciſe acts of legiſlation, their ſubjects ceaſed to be ſurpriſed; they forgot at laſt that the crown had uſurped the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative authority: and at preſent the idea of this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity having been veſted in the crown during every period of the monarchy, is ſo univerſal in France, that any aſſertion to the contrary would be deemed abſurd.</p>

                  <p>The Venetians, weary of the long and tyrannic domination of their Prince, reaſſumed, in 1171, the reins of government. They continued, indeed, to elect a doge, but fixed ſuch boundaries to his power, that ſcarce any thing was left him but a title. The ſupreme authority reſided in the people at large: however, as the concurrence of every one to every thing was impoſſible, they transferred the ſovereignty to a council compoſed of 470 citizens, nominated by 12 electors; but that every one might have his turn, there was to be yearly a new election on St. Michael's day. The authority of this council was unbounded,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0044000700:194"/>and by leaving it ſo, the people were ſoon reduced to ſubjection by their repreſentatives<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>When the ſovereign acts by deputies, unleſs their power be limited by the fundamental laws of the ſtate, a ſingle attempt is oftentimes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ruin liberty. In this reſpect, the Engliſh conſtitution is extremely defective. Our repreſentatives are the guardians of our rights; they muſt always defend, never attack them. But no boundaries have been fixed to their authority, in order to ſecure the conſtitution againſt their attempts. They enter into no engagements with their conſtituents. After they are elected, they take their place in the ſenate; and inſtead of conſidering themſelves only as the defenders of the conſtitution, they believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the arbiters of it; they have even altered it many times.</p>
                        <p>It was a fundamental law of the kingdom, that parliament ſhould be held once every year, or more frequently, if neceſſary. During the reign of Edward I. this law was confirmed, but afterwards altered. Under Henry VIII. the parliament paſſed an act for prolonging its duration to ſeven years. This act was made triennial under Charles I. Under Charles II. it was changed to an act for the aſſembling and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a parliament once in three years at leaſt, and again rendered ſepten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial in 1716. In every one of theſe acts of legiſlation, the parliament has overpaſſed the boundaries of its power. The right of determining the frequency of elections and ſeſſions, unqueſtionably belongs to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at large, and to the people at large alone. For if the repreſentatives have a right to fix the duration of their commiſſion to three or ſeven years, why not to extend it to fifteen, twenty, thirty, or rather to render it perpetual, that is to ſay, a right to render themſelves indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, to overturn the conſtitution, to oppreſs their conſtituents, and reduce the nation to ſlavery?</p>
                        <p>One might imagine that the fatal conſequences of this abuſe have eſcaped and ſtill eſcape our notice, when, among our moſt ſpirited patriots, many inconſiderate men are at infinite pains by their frequent motions for
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0044000700:195"/>a triennial bill, to induce the people to acknowledge, as lawful, the authority of the parliament on that point.</p>
                        <p>What I ſay, on the frequency of elections, I ſay likewiſe on that of ſeſſions, and generally with reſpect to whatever belongs to the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal laws of the ſtate. With an unbounded power to redreſs public grievances, the repreſentatives of the people ought to have none to alter the conſtitution, not even to render it perfect, without previouſly taking the advice of the nation. Notwithſtanding the parliament have for a long time arrogated to themſelves the right of extending their authority in every point, this right muſt be claimed by the people, and the utmoſt influence ought to be exerted in order to put themſelves in poſſeſſion of it. According as this point is gained or loſt, we are free or ſlaves. As long as the power of our repreſentatives is not confined within proper limits, liberty may be enjoyed, but is not firmly eſtabliſhed; we have no other laws but the decrees of our deputies; thus abſolute maſters of our birth-rights, they may ſubject us to the yoke, tyrannize over us, and forbid us even to complain.</p>
                        <p>I do not ſay, that the legiſlature intends to make ſo iniquitous an uſe of their power; but they can, when they pleaſe, as long as their power is not reduced within proper bounds. But how is their power to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced? The union of the people, not the ſtep which ought to be taken, is the chief point to be attended to. However our meaſures be planned, they will always prove ſucceſsful when we purſue them in concert, and we may do it, as ſoon as willing.</p>
                        <p>When, under Henry VIII. the parliament paſſed the ſeptennial act, under Charles I. the triennial act, and under Charles II. the act for aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and holding of parliament once in three years at leaſt, the electors might be excuſed for not having diſavowed their deputies; in thoſe times of diſcord and confuſion, to reſcue the ſtate from the brink of deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the only object in view: But at preſent, that ſuperſtition no
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0044000700:196"/>more enflames and divides the minds of the people, if parliament ſhould be ever ſo inconſiderate as to prolong its duration, and refuſe, at the requeſt of the nation, to recall the act, however hard be the neceſſity of vindicating liberty by force, the nation ought not to defer a moment to take up arms. This is the caſe of a juſt revolt.</p>

                  <p>Cromwell returning victorious from his expedition into Scotland, was honoured with a deputation from parliament, and other marks of diſtinction. He then entered the capital in triumph, and as every one ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſought his favour, this crafty diſſembler only thought how to reconcile to himſelf all parties. At firſt he made uſe of his credit to obtain for the royaliſts better terms, he captivated the affections of the preſbyterians by an affected auſterity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſeduced the bigots by exclaiming againſt the looſeneſs of the miniſters of religion, flattered the army by cauſing them to entertain ſuſpicions about the parliament, and gained the affections of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0044000700:197"/>whole nation by earneſtly ſoliciting a new election of repreſentatives. He afterwards filled with his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures all military places, and the firſt civil offices, incited the malcontents to riſe, repaired to parliament followed by a band of devoted ſatellites, charged the patriotic members with ambitious deſigns, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them the houſe. No ſooner did Cromwell become ſole maſter of the government by this act of violence, but he formed a cabinet council of the chief officers of the army who were the moſt in his intereſts, placed himſelf at the helm, and had a new parliament elected: but not finding them enough ſubmiſſive, he engaged the proſtituted members to riſe, and to reſign into his hands their authority: in fine, he expelled the patriotic party, and uſurped the ſupreme power under the ſpecious denomination of Protector.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the ſenators were aſſembled, Chriſtian III. of Sweden, complained to his guards of the little regard theſe Magiſtrates paid him; aided by them, he then ſecured their perſons, obliged them to reſign their places, which he conferred on his creatures, rewarded his adherents, aſſembled his troops, beſtowed gratifications on the officers, exhorted his ſubjects to be ſubmiſſive, and remained in peaceable poſſeſſion of the ſovereignty.</p>

                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0044000700:209"/>What people did ever deſerve this laſt reproach more than ourſelves? We never ceaſe boaſting of the excellencies of our conſtitution, and by continually extolling it, we are not ſenſible of its defects, and neglect to reform them.</p>
                  <p>The conſtitution of England is, no doubt, a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of political wiſdom, if compared to others; yet it is not ſo perfect as we are pleaſed to affirm, nor can it be ſo, conſidering its origin and its revolutions. If traced to its firſt principle, it will be found to be very ſimple, and ſuch as ſuited uncivilized men; good enough for a people who ſubſiſted by pillaging, but containing a thouſand ſources of anarchy.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as theſe concealed cauſes unfolded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the kingdom was tore by domeſtic factions, remained expoſed to foreign invaſion, became the prey of an uſurper, and was reduced to the moſt deplorable ſubjection by its rulers. Under our kings of the houſes of Plantagenet, Tudor, and Stuart, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm was attached to the monarchy. The diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, the power of rendering arbitrary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of impriſoning, of exacting forced loans and benevolences, of preſſing and quartering ſoldiers, of erecting monopolies, were all exerciſed in their turn.</p>
                  <p>Weary of groaning under oppreſſion, we have ſometimes attempted to ſhake off our yoke; but all
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0044000700:210"/>our meaſures to recover liberty, far from being free national tranſactions, were mere acts of violence of the ſtrongeſt party.</p>
                  <p>During our civil diſſentions, every party, as it prevailed, has almoſt always been buſy in cruſhing the others: and amidſt the inſolence of victory erected themſelves as the maſters of the nation.</p>
                  <p>Yet if ever the triumphing party ſtipulated for common liberty; unable, in the tumult of arms and the public agitation of mind, to eſtabliſh it on a firm baſis, in order to form a regular adminiſtration of juſtice, they have applied only a palliative remedy to the moſt urgent evils, and brought back the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its firſt principles, or nearer its primitive inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p>The only favourable juncture for ſecuring public liberty, was at the acceſſion of the houſe of Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick; as the triumphant part then formed a great majority in the nation, and the Prince<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>In 1719, George I. propoſed to eſtabliſh the freedom of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution by ſecuring that part which is the moſt liable to abuſes—the limiting the prerogative of creating Peers; and that prerogative, ſo deſtructive to liberty, and which the king was very willing to diveſt himſelf, was, againſt his will, preſerved to the crown.</p>
                     </note> was without ambitious deſigns; but this favourable juncture we let ſlip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0044000700:211"/>But I leave the conſideration of defects which might have been reformed, for the examination of defects which ſtill remain.</p>
                  <p>In a well conſtituted government, the people at large is the real ſovereign, to them belongs ſupreme power: but among us the Prince has circumſcribed the boundaries of national<note n="*" place="bottom">See the tenor of all the Charters, upon which our birth-rights are founded.</note> liberties; whilſt the nation ought to have circumſcribed thoſe of royal prerogative. This defect in the conſtitution is capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Several of our kings have availed themſelves of it to tyrannize over the ſubjects; it proved the cauſe of all the differences between Parliament and James I. Charles I. and Charles II. it was likewiſe in virtue of it that James II. reaſſumed the charters of the city of London, nay, thoſe of all the corporations in the kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Yet let a veil be drawn over this humiliating origin of our birth-rights. Thus emancipated, had we at leaſt recovered ſovereignty: but we are ſtill no more than an emancipated people; in no national tranſactions does the parliament appear conſcious of their preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; in all their addreſſes to the throne, reſpecting affairs of public concern, they ever mention the king's
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0044000700:212"/>perſon and prerogative in the firſt place; the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the laws, and liberty of the kingdom ever in the laſt.</p>
                  <p>The repreſentatives of the people are admitted into the great council of the nation as truſtees for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well as councellors for the king; but in the oath of fidelity they take at their admiſſion, they conſider themſelves as the king's ſervants only <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>I do promiſe and ſwear to be faithful, and to bear a true allegiance to his Majeſty.—So help me God. Such is the oath of fidelity of the members of the houſe of commons.</p>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>To the people at large only the legiſlative power ought to belong; this power they exerciſe either by themſelves or by repreſentatives: but among us one particular claſs of ſubjects ſhare that power indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of any conſtitutive authority. By birth, they are the king's hereditary councellors, they make one of the three eſtates in conjunction with the lords ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and with them, are ſupreme judges in the realm; nay, the arbiters of it: they diſpoſe of the crown, when the throne becomes vacant, and pronounce in laſt reſort upon all cauſes that have been decided in any of the courts of juſtice.</p>
                  <p>To ſuch extenſive power are annexed high dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and many prerogatives equally oppreſſive and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0044000700:213"/>inſulting<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Let it not be ſaid, that theſe prerogatives are no more than paying them a mock reverence, and ſounding in their ears an empty title; the laws being made to reſtrain them as well as others. But allowing the laws to be impartial, are they not eluded by men of title? Except a ſingle caſe—murder; in all others the dignity which inſpires them with preſumption to oppreſs the defenceleſs, is joined to an eſtate which affords them means to ſupport their outrages: men of no large fortunes, or eaſy circumſtances are therefore not ſafe from their inſolence and caprice.</p>
                     </note> to other ſubjects. It is for their ſublime virtues and exalted merit, that they are honoured with a coronet? No, the fatal privileges which they claim and arrogate to themſelves, are but the inheritance of the plunders, uſurpations, and violences of their anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>When the people at large cannot act by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to them belongs the right of nominating their repreſentatives; but among us this right is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to a ſmall part of the nation<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>In the reign of Henry IV. laws were enacted limiting the electors to ſuch as poſſeſſed forty ſhillings (a ſum equivalent to twenty pounds of our preſent money) a year in land, free from all burthen, within the county: although the letter of this law has not been maintained, we may learn from the following preamble of the ſtatute, that this defect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, I object to, proceeds from the licentious ſpirit and iniquitous pretenſions of the nobility.</p>
                        <p>"Whereas the elections of knights have of late, in many counties of England, been made outrageous by an exceſſive number of people, many of them of ſmall ſubſtance and value, yet pretending to a right equal to the beſt knights and eſquires; whereby manſlaughters, riots, batteries, and diviſions among the gentlemen and other people of the ſame counties, ſhall very likely riſe and be, unleſs due remedy be provided in this behalf," &amp;. <hi>Statutes at Large,</hi> 8 <hi>Henry</hi> IV. cap. 7.</p>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0044000700:214"/>of the reſt. Nay, of this part of the nation, few individuals have as great influence as the moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous corporations; many ſmall boroughs having a right to ſend repreſentatives in parliament. Let us overlook the monſtrous abuſe that four or five thatched houſes ſhould be upon a level in the great council of the nation with the largeſt cities of the kingdom: but theſe inſignificant boroughts have been privileged by the crown for the purpoſe of corruption, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; for by the influence of the court their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are always choſen.</p>
                  <p>In a moment of patriotic<note n="*" place="bottom">In 1656.</note> fermentation, a law indeed was enacted for voiding all elections of parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament-men, where the elected members had been at any expence in meat, drink, or money, to procure votes: but was any proviſion made by that law for diſcovering and perſecuting ſecret offenders; and do our elections the leſs exhibit ſcenes of ſcandalous tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions? Inſtead of ſeeing electors zealous to declare themſelves for merit only, and candidates waiting for their lot with a becoming dignity: a cringing band of ſuitors are ſeen, beſtowing, without ſhame, flatteries and bribes on men they look upon with contempt, the inſtant they have extorted their votes; and a proſtituted herd of voters glutting themſelves without remorſe at lawleſs banquetings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0044000700:215"/>The people's repreſentatives are the defenders, not the arbiters of the conſtitution. Guardians of the national rights, they ought always to defend and never attack them. Hence, although they may be intruſted with a boundleſs authority to redreſs public grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, they ought to have only a limited one to enact ſtatutes<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>A free legiſlature, ſays a celebrated hiſtorian of ours, cannot do any thing illegal. According to this maxim, which is true only when a people at large exerciſe the legiſlative power, a whole nation is at the mercy of its repreſentatives, having not even the right of complaining, when tyrannized over by them.</p>
                     </note>: but where are the boundaries fixed to the power of our deputies, in order to ſecure from their attempts the ſanctuary of the laws?</p>
                  <p>When the repreſentatives are intruſted with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited power, the people ought at leaſt to have a conſtitutional authority to reſtrain or diſown them as ſoon as they abuſe their truſt: By what obligations are our deputies reſtrained to the obſervance of the duties of their office? We have a right, indeed, to watch over their conduct; but when they make iniquitous laws, how are we to diſown them? When they attack our liberties, how repreſs them? By petitioning the Prince? What a fine contrivance, to have recourſe for redreſs of our grievances to the chief author of them! Has he not many times rendered illuſive the right of remonſtrating, by diſregarding our petitions? How
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0044000700:216"/>then are we to obviate this denial of juſtice? We have no other law, therefore, than the arbitrary commands of our repreſentatives, who may at will neglect our intereſts, attack our liberties and ſell our birth-rights; without being called to any account, or incurring any other damage, than not being choſen another time. Even this trifling reſtraint is wanting in our conſtitution! Have not our commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners taken upon themſelves to determine the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their commiſſion? If they are authorized to extend it to ſeven years, why not to twenty, forty, ſixty; why not to render themſelves independent of their conſtituents? Thus we are reduced to the deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſituation of ſeeing our liberties invaded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to oppoſe more than vain murmurs, or reduced to the ſituation ſtill more deplorable of vindicating our rights with arms in our hands<note n="*" place="bottom">How many times have they made it unlawful to reſiſt their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in any caſe!</note>.</p>
                  <p>The repreſentatives of the people, being intruſted with the intereſts of the public, ought to enter into an engagement with their conſtituents: our deputies, when at firſt admitted into the ſenate, take, indeed, an oath of fidelity, but in that oath there is not a ſingle word mentioned about the nation<note n="†" place="bottom">See the form of their oath of fidelity in a preceeding note.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0044000700:217"/>The repreſentatives of the people ought ever to act according to the inſtructions of their conſtituents: but our deputies exerciſe their delegated power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever conſulting us. When once elected, they take not any more notice of us. We have therefore no hand in the laws enacted by them; and how many times have the reſolves of the houſe been directly oppoſite to the ſentiments of the people they repreſent? What are then our repreſentatives, but our maſters?</p>
                  <p>The laws enacted in the great council of the nation ought to promote public welfare: but among us what a neglect of national intereſt; how ſeldom does any bill, but of a private nature, paſs? Even to make a motion for theſe bills, friends in the houſe are always neceſſary, and frequently ſuch friends are bought. Has it not been notorious in many inſtances, that parliament-men have been induced for lucre's ſake to proſtitute their abilities, and ſacrifice their country in the furtherance of any job, how dirty and iniquitious ſoever? Open the journal of the Britiſh ſenate, and there you will find many proofs of this ſad truth<note n="*" place="bottom">Among the many inſtances, I confine myſelf to the affairs of the India company in 1693.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The repreſentatives of the people ought to attend with diligence the duty of their office: but our
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0044000700:218"/>deputies either ſit or abſent themſelves juſt as they pleaſe, except in ſome extraordinary juncture; and by their negligence ever make it the more eaſy for the miniſter to carry his point. Neglect of duty is even at preſent an artifice ſeveral of them make uſe of to make their beſt advantage of that power they are truſted with: nay, the moſt infignificant among them, by thus abſenting themſelves, have found out a method to oblige the miniſter to ſtipulate; for in the great council of the nation matters are carried by the number of votes, not by the weight of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p>As the people alone have a right to ſelect their repreſentatives, they alone have a right to declare their choice, and to maintain it: but our deputies have arrogated to themſelves the eſſential privilege of judging of returns, nay, of excluding ſuch members as they object to, in ſpite of their conſtituents.</p>
                  <p>Talents and virtue ought to be the only qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions required in repreſentatives of the people; and the man whom they grace, whatever be his rank or circumſtances, ought to be preferred to that honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able office: but our deputies conſtrain their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents to ſelect them from among a particular claſs
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0044000700:219"/>of ſubjects which is not<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>By virtue of an act of parliament, all its members muſt be men of a landed intereſt.

                     </note> the leaſt ignorant, nor the leaſt corrupted part of the nation.</p>
                  <p>Every Engliſhman of an unſpotted character, a good underſtanding, and an independant, though ſmall fortune, might have formerly offered himſelf as candidate: but now neither virtue, patriotic zeal, nor ſervices are regarded; money without merit † opens the door of the ſenate, by which fools and knaves enter commonly in ſuch droves as leave very little room for the admiſſion of worthy men. In order to ſecure its freedom, parliament, it is ſaid, has thus lodged more or leſs power in the ſeveral degrees of ſubjects, as they have greater or leſs intereſt in the common ſtock. I confeſs that thoſe ought to have the care of public affairs, who, <hi>ceteris paribus,</hi> have the largeſt ſtake in public weal, becauſe the public have then, in the property of wealthy men, a ſecurity for their good conduct, which is wanting in men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fortune; but wealthy men are not always thoſe who have the greateſt concern for public ſafety, and fortune alone is a very bad guarantee. I appeal to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0044000700:220"/>precedents. All thoſe members who gave up to Henry VII. Henry VIII. and Mary, the birth-rights of the ſubjects; all thoſe who proſtituted themſelves to the will of James I. Charles II. and James II; all thoſe who had, by their violent proceedings relating to foreign affairs, ſo much diſguſted the whole nation, and given cauſe to the Kentiſh petition<note n="*" place="bottom">Pr. H. C. iii. 140.</note>, were they not men of property? all thoſe likewiſe who have lately devoted themſelves to the court, are they not men of property? If ever virtue has ſhone in parliament, it was only when the iniquitous practices of the court, and the very brink of deſtruction; and when the care of public ſafety obliged the electors to be determined in their choice of repreſentatives only by probity, abilities, and patriotic zeal.</p>
                  <p>The allurements tendered to virtue are not of ſo palpable and ſtriking a kind as the baits of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and none but the wiſe and virtuous are greedy of them: men whoſe whole merit conſiſts in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, covet only to enlarge their eſtate at the expence of their honour, and the intereſt of their country; ever ready to join thoſe at the helm in meaſures rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to the people, as long as they find in it their own intereſt.—To ſelect our repreſentatives from among
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0044000700:221"/>wealthy men, is prudent, if they are not deſtitute of merit: but when luxury, extravagance, ignorance, debauchery, and venality, are their only characteriſtics, why not turn our choice upon the virtuous and wiſe, who grace the other claſſes of ſociety?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, from ſuch an inconſiderate choice ever reſults a partiality in the laws. When deputies exerciſe acts of legiſlation, they ſeldom make any law which reſtrains themſelves; and often make ſuch as they may turn to their own advantage. We have no need to look for the proofs of this truth in foreign annals, it is unfortunately but too obvious in thoſe of our own country.</p>
                  <p>To complain that the inferior claſſes of the people receive no advantage from the laws relating to property (ſince being without fortune, they have no ſhare in lucrative eſtabliſhments, and nothing to loſe) would perhaps be deemed too great a preſumption by thoſe opulent Sybarites who, from their elevation, look down with contempt upon the poor, whom they believe not made to ſhare their pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>Let us then overlook the advantages of ſociety, and confine ourſelves to the proſpect of its diſadvantages. I ſhall not mention here the hearth-money, the game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws, and the heavy taxes laid on the neceſſaries of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0044000700:222"/>life, ſo oppreſſive to the poor<note n="*" place="bottom">They are rendered ſtill more ſo to them by their incapability of buying any thing wholeſale.</note>; there are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant inſtances of oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>The act for raiſing the recruits, paſſed in 1703-4, empowers the juſtices of peace to take up ſuch idle perſons as have no calling nor means of ſubſiſtence, and to deliver them to the officers of the army.</p>
                  <p>In a ſociety originally formed among men much in the ſame circumſtances, and wherein poverty ſhould be conſtantly the conſequence of bad conduct; ſuch an act might have the ſacred character of juſtice. But in a government eſtabliſhed among men, where the ſtrongeſt and moſt artful have invaded almoſt every thing; in a government where poverty is often the conſequence of misfortunes, nay, of the injuſtice of knaves; where the induſtry and diligence of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents cannot always afford their giving any education to their family, or preſerving their morals unſpotted; where, without a proper capital, it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to carry on any lucrative buſineſs, or even to get an honeſt livelihood, and where po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty becomes the everlaſting lot of the poor, what law could be more unjuſt?</p>
                  <p>Reduced to linger in miſery, are the indigents beſides to be forced to protect, at the expence of their
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0044000700:223"/>blood, the inheritance, or ſecure the peace of the poſterity of their uſurpers, and at the riſk of their lives, to defend the power of their tyrants? Hear, however, their inſolent oppreſſors giving, without the leaſt remorſe, their advice thereon: <hi>Wars ſweep away, four or five times in a century, vagrants, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, and ſuch like dregs of mankind.</hi>

                  <p>There are foundations for poor among us, it will be ſaid: but what pen, eloquent enough, could deſcribe with propriety the ſhocking ſcene of a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, or what man ever ſo ſavage could take a view of it without ſhaking with horror. Diſmal places! wherein the needy is kept alive by unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food, lays in naſtineſs, breathes an infected air, and groans under the ſevere hand of a warden; wretched habitations! wherein abuſes, diſeaſes and hunger reign conſtantly. Of thoſe who are confined there, how many fall victims to their hard fate; and how few, rather than re-enter therein, unleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by intolerable neceſſity, prefer not ſtarving at the door of the rich?</p>
                  <p>The poor, almoſt entirely deſtitute of aſſiſtance againſt hunger, find as little againſt diſeaſe. Who does not know that letters of recommendation are neceſſary among us, to be admitted into hoſpitals? Thus whilſt the door of them is ever open to the ſervants of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0044000700:224"/>our gentry and nobility, it is almoſt conſtantly ſhut againſt the needy, the unſupported, the friendleſs wretch.</p>
                  <p>Among the many diſmal and horrid ſcenes of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which, in our ſo much exalted government, are but too often diſcloſed reſpecting the poor, let one more ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>"The injured member of ſociety, whom the jury acquit, or whom the villain by whoſe machination he was confined dares not appear to proſecute, is dragged back to his dungeon, where he is again confined, without mercy, by the tyrant of the gaol, till he has paid what he demands of him under the ſpecious denomination of fees;" thus unjuſtly condemned to ſuffer puniſhments which ought to be inflicted on profligate malefactors alone, and reduced, in the horrors of his mind, inceſſantly to curſe the day of his birth.</p>
                  <p>A few, a very few, benevolent members, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received intimation of theſe cruelties, have indeed ſometimes made a motion to enquire into the ſtate of the gaols, but to no effect. The legiſlators, remote as they are from ſuch a wretched condition, behold without concern thoſe abominable abuſes, and never think them worth being reformed. Who are the friends to the poor in a ſenate compoſed of rich men
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0044000700:225"/>only; who are the members acquainted with the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the needy, the miſery wherein he lingers, and the injuries he undergoes; or if they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, who are the members eager to reſcue and relieve him? But they do not thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their own intereſts; and whilſt leaving without pity a vaſt number of their fellow creatures to groan under the weight of the moſt cruel oppreſſion, they, without ſhame, make, alter, and amend acts for ſecuring the property of their dogs.</p>
                  <p>Be it again ſaid, as long as the members that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the legiſlature are ſelected from among one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular claſs of people, it muſt never be expected to ſee them applying themſelves to promote common welfare: and like the parliament under Mary<note n="*" place="bottom">1 and 2 Philip and Mary, c. 6.</note>, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecured their own poſſeſſions, they will be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>But let us draw, with indignation, a veil over theſe myſteries of iniquity, to continue our examination.</p>
                  <p>Although at the mercy of our repreſentatives, yet we have much more to dread from our Prince.</p>
                  <p>Our forefathers, indeed, have taken much care to circumſcribe the prerogative of the crown, but not enought to curb its power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0044000700:226"/>The king ought to be only the prime magiſtrate of the people, but he is the arbiter of the nation.</p>
                  <p>Sole maſter of calling and diſſolving parliament, if he but refuſes to aſſemble them, legiſlature is anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated: In ſuch caſe what conſtitutional authority has a right to interpoſe? The law has provided for it, it is ſaid, as it obliges the king, by his own wants, to call a parliament. But ſhould a crafty Prince lay by, during many years, the fruit of his oeconomy, as well as the produce of ſelling the foreſt woods, creating dignities<note n="*" place="bottom">What a large ſum did James I. raiſe by ſelling the dignities of baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, knight of Nova Scotia, baron, viſcount, earl, &amp;c. Winwood, vol. iii. p. 385.</note>, granting letters patents for monopoly and grants of concealments, or have recourſe to the expedient of levying loans, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the exchequer, who can anſwer that a mean could not be thus contrived for doing without the legiſlature?</p>
                  <p>Did not Charles I. govern for twelve years together without a parliament? Yes, but he got money by levying arbitrary taxes, and forcing loans. Did not Charles II. become abſolute maſter of his kingdom, without army, without money, without foreign aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and govern us with tyrannic ſway? How little was then wanting to reduce us to perpetual ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude?
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0044000700:227"/>Was it the wiſdom of our conſtitution, or even our virtue, that reſcued the ſtate from the brink of deſtruction?</p>
                  <p>But let us ſuppoſe that what has once happened, never will happen again.</p>
                  <p>The ſeſſion of parliament holds as long as the king pleaſes, and we are too well acquainted with the uſe our Princes of the Stuart line made of this prerogative, not to dread the conſequences of it.</p>
                  <p>The king has no legiſlative power, but can procure a legiſlature at his devotion, by his great influence in the election of repreſentatives. When a new parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called, beſides the votes procured by the money which is privately diſtributed for that purpoſe, the miniſter diſpoſes of all the votes of the tradeſmen who ſerve his majeſty in the ſeveral towns, and of all thoſe that placemen and other creatures of the court command in the ſeveral boroughs: The lord lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and other perſons in authority, in the counties and towns, exert, moreover, all their intereſts and addreſs to get ſuch members choſen as are favourable to the deſigns of the crown.</p>
                  <p>Not ſatisfied with ſecret practices, the adminiſtration even employs violence in order to fill the great council of the nation with court dependants. It is illegal to bring troops into the neighbourhood of an election;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0044000700:228"/>but the miniſter byaſſes the electors, by hiring a band of determinate villains to frighten them into a choice of a miniſterial candidate: and of what crime ſoever ſuch villains may be guilty, the Prince is not aſhamed to ſcreen them from puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>As the place-bill does not regard the upper houſe, by creating peers of the realm ſuch commoners as have greateſt influence in elections, and ſecuring theſe new peers, it is in the power of the court ever to command a majority in the lower houſe.</p>
                  <p>If the king neglects to influence a choice of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives; when they are choſen, he may influence their reſolutions at his will.</p>
                  <p>The king has no demeſnes within the kingdom; but he is the fountain of all honours, and diſpoſes of all places, eccleſiaſtical, civil, and military. Hence a great number of hirelings in parliament; this number he can ever increaſe, it being in his power to multiply places and offices: nay, by only augmenting the number of the officers of his houſhold, he may diſpoſe at his will of the whole ſenate.</p>
                  <p>The place-bill, it is ſaid, prevents in that reſpect the influence of the king, and is the great bulwark of parliamentary independence. A groſs error this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0044000700:229"/>Does a commiſſion in the army, the navy, or the militia, vacate a ſeat in parliament? Does even the place of attorney or ſolicitor general, lord lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the counties, receiver of the king's cuſtoms, keeper of his majeſty's gates, roads, and bridges, director and clerk of the royal hoſpitals, lord of the board of trade and plantations, lord of the admiralty, member of the court of exchequer, and board of green cloth, commiſſioner of the treaſury, groom of their majeſties' bed-chambers, and any other office of the houſhold; nay, does a place of privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, or of ſecretary of ſtate, incapacitate from being a repreſentative? Suppoſe, however, that the place-bill incapacitates perſons who have an office or place of profit under the king, or receive a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the crown, to ſerve as a member of the houſe of commons; does it incapacitate thoſe who receive marks of dignity or titles of honour, does it incapacitate thoſe whoſe relations and friends have places of profit under the court, thoſe who receive ſecret douceurs, thoſe who are dependant on place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and creatures of the court; does it regard the houſe of peers, although it be well known that the lords diſpoſe of a third part of the houſe of commons? In fine, that great bulwark of parliamentary inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence was no ſooner erected than ſubverted by
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0044000700:230"/>private contracts; no proviſion having been made by that law for diſcovering ſecret offenders.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the places and dignities, of which the king diſpoſes, the exorbitant ſums aſſigned for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his houſhold, the penſions he grants, the douceurs his miniſters manage for his tools in negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting public loans<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Public lotteries—a meaſure which the diſtreſſes of government alone ought to force, are commonly undertook in England for the noble pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, not only of keeping up the ſpirit of gaming among the people, but to ſecure members of the lower houſe, by negotiating the loans in a way beneficial to the ſubſcribers, and thus to buy friends to the miniſtry with the nation's money.</p>
                     </note>, the promiſes with which they feed the hopes of thoſe hungry harpies who ſeek to feaſt on the vitals of their country, the tricks of craft<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>The clear-ſighted have too much ſenſe to truſt to bare promiſes, or accept of tenures unſtable and reſting upon uncertainties; with them the miniſter deals ready money: but how many are ſo ſilly as to accept of any terms? Having ſupported, by their dead vote, the intereſts of the court, they afterwards ſee themſelves at the diſcretion of its; the miniſter uſing them as dogs, as they deſerve, gives them but a bare bone to pick: their twelve or ſix hundred a year dwindle to three or two, without their daring to complain, for fear of proving their proſtitution. Thoſe who are ſkilled in the tricks of policy know that there are few places of one thouſand pounds a year, but have two or three penſioners quartered upon them.</p>
                     </note> with which they deceive the ſimple, the ſmiles of the court which lull the vain into obſequiouſneſs, the intereſted but warm rhetoric of his creatures which
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0044000700:231"/>draws into his party all thoſe who have not an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding clear enough to ſecure their virtue; theſe means, I ſay, enable him to have at his diſpoſal the greateſt number of votes in the great council of the nation, to corrupt the members of the legiſlature gradually, make them ſpeak as he pleaſes, and convert tyranny into law.</p>
                  <p>The commons nominate their ſpeaker, but their choice is void, unleſs approved by the king; and the influence of a ſpeaker on the proceedings and reſolves of the whole houſe, is too well known, to conſider this prerogative as of no conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Even the polity of the legiſlature is favourable to the views of the crown. In parliament, every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber gives his vote openly: this method of voting is excellent it itſelf; but as the miniſters are admitted into the ſenate, it ſerves but to force the corrupted members to become traitors to their country.</p>
                  <p>Although the king cannot call to an account the members for freedom of ſpeech in parliament; yet, if any of them, in giving full ſcope to his patriotic zeal, drops a few inconſiderate expreſſions, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Prince exclaim againſt this want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for royal majeſty, and cry out, <hi>The Tower, the Tower;</hi> on the contrary, if the hirelings retained by
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0044000700:232"/>the court diſplay in their fawning ſpeeches the moſt odious flatteries, they have nothing to fear but the bitter ſmiles of the friends of liberty.</p>
                  <p>When the commons have diſregarded their duty, was there ever found any virtue among the lords? But we know too much of their proceedings to turn on that ſide our fond hopes. Even in the moſt critical junctures, and when the commons were ſtruggling againſt the incroachments of the crown under the Stuarts, the lords remained idle, and ſeemed to ſhow little concern at the fears and jealouſies expreſſed by the people. Beſides, there is in their houſe a ſacred tribe, ever blindly devoted from principle to the court.</p>
                  <p>However, ſuppoſing there were in the upper houſe many virtuous members, as the place-bill does not regard it, by making new peers, the court may always ſecure a majority, as has been oftentimes the caſe.</p>
                  <p>The legiſlature is indeed a check upon the crown; yet only when it is intirely independent. For as ſoon as ſelfiſh intereſted views prevail among its members, the parliament—the ſtrength and glory of Britain, turns a profligate faction, who, partaking of the Prince's bounty, and hoping to ſhare with him the ſpoils of their country, join thoſe at the helm in their
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0044000700:233"/>criminal deſigns, and ſupport their deſtructive mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; —a band of diſguiſed traitors, who, under the name of guardians, traffic away the national intereſt and the rights of a free-born people.</p>
                  <p>A King of England will ever endeavour to make his progreſs to abſolute empire by a penſionary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. I have ſhewn what conſidence the people may place in the great council of the nation, as long as our ſo much exalted conſtitution ſhall remain as it is. Under Charles II. the parliament was filled with a band of abject penſioners, and the nation wept at the ſight of their ſenators clothed with the badges of ſlavery: what once was ſeen, may be ſeen again; alas, is it not in ſome ſort already the caſe? Peruſe the liſt of the houſe of commons, and you will find it chiefly compoſed of men who have offices, or places of profit under the king. Nor is even this the worſt of the diſmal proſpect which lies before us.</p>
                  <p>The king has no right to lay any tax, but the crown has the prerogative of diſpoſing of the public money, when depoſited in an aggregated fund in the treaſury. To prevent the miſapplication of public revenue, it has been reſolved to allow out of it ſeparate incomes for the ſupport of the government, and the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the crown dignity; the reſt is under the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0044000700:234"/>command of the parliament, and the commons exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the current ſervice of each year. But as the ſum allotted for ſecret ſervices has not been limited by law, a pretence of ſquandering the nation's money is left to the miniſtry, if not a ſafe and eaſy mean of filling up the king's coffers, and enriching themſelves.</p>
                  <p>A warrant for paying money out of the treaſury muſt, indeed, go through the hands of proper officers; but the king nominates theſe officers, and removes them at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>To prevent abuſes, the commons have the right of inquiring into the diſpoſal of public money; but this prerogative of the crown is liable to the controul of the houſe, only when parliament is aſſembled.</p>
                  <p>The houſe has a right to call the great officers of the crown to an account; but with money which has been embezzled, the miniſter can engage them not to take cognizance of his miſdemeanor and plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. An enormous defect in our conſtitution this, of which we had lately the ſad experience!</p>
                  <p>Royal prerogative is not circumſcribed here. The king alone has a right to make war, peace, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, even without conſulting the nation. Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of that monſtrous abuſe of intruſting a ſole individual with a power to ſacrifice to his caprices the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0044000700:235"/>blood of a multitude, of diverting the public attention in a critical juncture, evading the redreſs of national grievances, and making away with many troubleſome patriots, by nominating them to perilous employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; how many other inconveniencies!</p>
                  <p>The king's deſigns, when they have received the ſanction of both houſes, are ever carried into execution at the nation's expence: the ſum they require may be employed againſt its deſtination: how many inſtances of this under Charles II.?</p>
                  <p>No war is made but a treaty follows, and few trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are concluded without money. Thus when the Prince ſells to the enemy the fruits of national victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or to any power the weight of his influence on the affairs of Europe, the ſums remitted remain in his hands; but the charges of ill ſucceſs are always placed to the account of the public<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <p>Did not Charles II. ſell Dunkirk to Louis XIV. for 5,000,000 of livres; and did not the louis d'ors of the French monarch engage Charles to ſacrifice the intereſts of his allies, and the freedom of Europe?</p>

A due balance of independency in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of a conſtitution is abſolutely neceſſary for its ſtability: but in the conſtitution of England, the royal prerogative ſo much overbalances the reſt, that when a ſubtle audacious enterprizing Prince ſhall aſcend the throne, the government will be ſubverted.</p>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0044000700:236"/>only; yet during that interval, what could not be done by an audacious monarch, who, having ſecured, for a long time, the affections both of ſoldiers and officers, ſhould on a ſudden pull off the maſk?</p>
                  <p>The ſoldiers are patriots, it is objected, the officers are men of honour, and thoſe at the head of the army, men of great property. What an objection this! <hi>The ſoldiers are patriots;</hi> but they are raiſed out of the moſt neceſſitous, the moſt ignorant, the moſt vicious part of the nation. What truſt can be placed in ſuch an abandoned race, whom idleneſs, debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, or crimes have driven to enliſt for bread? Is it to be ſuppoſed that mercenaries who ſell themſelves for ſix-pence a day, would not be ready to obey any command of a Prince, who ſhould flatter them with the hope of rendering their condition comfortable with the ſpoils of the citizens?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The officers are men of honour.</hi> Such among them who ſhould prove incorruptible, might be removed; yet how few would refuſe to purchaſe the ſmiles of a court at the expence of public liberty, and prefer
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0044000700:237"/>duty to favour, riches, and dignities? Beſides, when once the ſoldiers are ſecured, what is more eaſy than making officers?</p>

                     <hi>Thoſe at the head of the army are men of great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</hi> Well, were they not men of property who, at the head of armies, have joined with Princes to reduce the people to ſubjection?</p>
                  <p>Were they not men of property who, at the head of the army of Charles I. attempted to enſlave the nation?</p>
                  <p>Are they not men of property who, at the head of the army, keep their fellow ſubjects in foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſubmiſſive to the government?</p>
                  <p>If the Prince ſhould begin by beſtowing on officers dazzling tokens of favour, is it to be imagined that they would refuſe preſent profit from a fear of future diſadvantage?</p>
                  <p>If the power of the crown be formidable to the people at large, it is much more ſo to individuals.</p>
                  <p>A miniſter can, when he pleaſes, have perſons arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily ſeized, together with their papers and books, or oppreſs them other ways: but when a plaintiff brings an action againſt a miniſter, how difficult for him to obtain juſtice! Although we boaſt of having the beſt digeſted and moſt excellent body of laws, which any nation on the face of the globe could ever
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0044000700:238"/>poſſeſs; yet our laws are ſo prodigiouſly multiplied, and many of them ſo inaccurate, ſo obſcure, that the ſubtle politics of a jeſuiſtical miniſtry may very often evade the letter of them. Whenever the crown has incroached upon the ſubjects, in how many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant points has the matter entirely reſted upon the opinion of the judges? But how clear and indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſoever the claim of the plaintiff may be; beſides the ſecret dealings of the government to ſupport their arbitrary proceedings, how many means are employed to avoid trying the legality of their proceedings? Caſting eſſoigns, pleading privilege, ſtanding out in contempt of the court, evading the judgment by bills of exception, ſpecial verdicts, motions for a new trial, writs of error, &amp;c. are all made uſe of in their turn. Thus they prevent the cauſe being finally decided, by delaying until the poor proſecutor be overborn, in the long run, by dint of expence, or until an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental event, if not ſome dark expedient deprive him of any further need of a court of juſtice. However, ſuppoſing it to be as eaſy as it is difficult, to obtain redreſs, the arbitrary proceedings of the government, although condemned, are but little, if the leaſt, reſtrained. Let the encroachments of a miniſter be ever ſo outrageous, inſtead of meeting with a juſt retaliation, or having a ſevere cenſure paſſed on
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0044000700:239"/>him; the puniſhment he ſuffers is but apparent, for the only ſatisfaction that the injured party can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to is damages, which are ever defrayed at the public expence. Thus adminiſtration, having trampled under foot the rights of the ſubjects, mocks the ſword of juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are enormous defects in our conſtitution, and more than ſufficient to ruin liberty: yet how many more remain<note n="*" place="bottom">Add to the foregoing, that the Prince actually on the throne, is of himſelf powerful, and keeps on foot in his electorate a large body of troops, which, without obſtacle, might be embarked for theſe his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</note>?</p>

And whilſt we were groaning under the oppreſſive hand of James II. was it not accidentally that liberty ſprung up from its ruins? If the audacity alone of ſome of our Princes proved ſufficient to ſubject us to ſervitude; how much more ſo when aided by refined artifice? Times have changed, I allow, but the conſtitution is much the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Be it ſaid, therefore, notwithſtanding all thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums beſtowed on our conſtitution, liberty is precarious among us, it depends on the want of genius and audacity of our Princes, and chiefly on that ſpirit of independency which prevails in theſe times all over the nation.</p>
                  <p>As long as this ſpirit ſhall prevail, liberty may be enjoyed; we are undone as ſoon as it becomes extinct.</p>

               <p>THE inconſiderate vanity of the ſubjects, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, gives way to tyranny.</p>
               <p>At the death of a deſpot, the only inſtant when ſubjects might diſplay their true ſentiments, inſtead of acclamations, they wear mourning as courtiers.</p>
               <p>What hence? will it be ſaid. Alas, is it not ſelf-evident enough! By that inconſiderate vanity, you have deprived yourſelves of the only mean which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of being openly revenged of a bad Prince, and the only mean of honouring the memory of a good one; for if you diſplay ſuch marks of reſpect for a Tiberius, a Louis XI. a Henry VIII. what remains for a Marcus Aurelius, a Louis IX. a Henry V.?</p>
               <p>By that inconſiderate vanity, you have wreſted from your own hands the only rod which remained to repreſs the audacity of the ſucceſſor to the crown, the only reward to encourage him to the purſuit of virtue<note n="*" place="bottom">Of the Princes who mounted the Egyptian throne, how many turned virtuous, from the conſideration alone that ſepulture was refuſed to a bad one.</note>.</p>
               <p>By that abſurd vanity, you have deprived your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the only mean of diſtinguiſhing the ſecret
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0044000700:242"/>enemies to their country, you have placed yourſelves upon a level with the creatures of the court, and you blindly act the part of ſervile flatterers.</p>
               <p>By ſuch inconſiderate marks of reſpect, you have confounded the real relations of things. For the loſs of a Prince who could ſcarce liſp, the whole ſtate aſſumes a melancholy face, all is mournful, feaſts ceaſe, places of public entertainment are ſhut: whilſt for the loſs of the benefactors of the patria, of thoſe who have defended it at the expence of their blood, of thoſe who have enriched it by their knowledge, of thoſe who have honoured it with their virtues, no marks of public grief are ſeen, feaſts continue, and all appear gay. Nay, when an allied Prince dies, the ſubjects, imitating the court, wear black, whilſt in thoſe public calamities, when the plague lays waſte the provinces, when the fire of heaven conſumes the cities, when famine drives to deſpair uſeful labourers, no mourning, no public marks of affliction are ſeen.</p>
               <p>In fine, from that ſervile ſpirit, Princes proceed to enforce, as a duty, thoſe exterior marks of veneration; and eſtabliſhing their tyrannic empire in our very hearts, they command us to bemoan when they bemoan, and to laugh when they laugh.</p>
               <p>Henceforth political relations are ſubverted; the Prince is all, the Nation nothing.</p>

               <p>IN order to obtain their demand, it is the conſtant practice of thoſe who ſolicit any favour from Princes, to tell them, they have a boundleſs power, as God himſelf.</p>
               <p>In order to ſhare their authority, it is likewiſe the conſtant cuſtom of the miniſter to tell them that they are abſolute, that every thing muſt yield to their will, that they may diſpoſe of the fortune of their ſubjects, and that every meaſure to render their power irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is permitted when well planned, or attended with ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>On another ſide, penſioned lawyers and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, confounding all notions of ſound politics, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually repeat in their fawning ſpeeches, that Princes alone have a right to command, and ſubjects none but to obey; they build ſyſtems of injuſtice, and baſely proſtitute their incenſe.</p>
               <p>Vile authors publiſh theſe odious maxims; and, as if endeavouring to go beyond their own meanneſs, they aſſert that there is no<note n="*" place="bottom">Hobbes, de Imperio.</note> covenant between king

               <p>Poets, in their turn, diſplay theſe maxims in their verſes. Men engaged in the conduct of public affairs begin to ſpread them, at firſt with caution, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with effrontery. The creatures of the Prince, and all thoſe villains who build their fortune on the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0044000700:245"/>ruins of their country, join their proſtituted voices. Thus dictated by flattery and treaſon, and repeated by intereſt, fear, hope, or ſtupidity, theſe maxims take place.</p>
               <p>By continually hearing that Princes are abſolute, the people at laſt believe it. The credulous father gives with devotion theſe leſſons to his children; and children following blindly the prejudices of their father, royal prerogative eſtabliſhes itſelf in every mind, and every one thinks himſelf bound in duty to ſubmit to the yoke.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe ſcandalous tenets, ſervilely propagated and ſtupidly received, become the firmeſt ſupport of tyranny.</p>

               <p>THE people not only ſuffer themſelves to be enchained, but oftentimes offer their necks to the yoke.</p>
               <p>When a crafty man gains their confidence, he inſpires them with what ſentiment he pleaſes, and maſters them at will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0044000700:246"/>Having aſſiſted at the obſequies of Caeſar, Antony aſcends the roſtra, and holding the bloody gown of the emperor, moves the populace; who inſtantly ran with the torches of the funeral pile in their hands to ſet on fire the houſes of Caſſius and Brutus.</p>
               <p>But, conſidering what Mahomet, and other founders of ſects have done, what need is there for any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample?</p>
               <p>Not ſatisfied with being dupes, the people run ſometimes to ſervitude, and lend their own hands to forge their chains. Never thinking that in a free coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, every ſubject has a right to inform againſt the ſervants of the public, they ever blindly abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their zeal for thoſe who have appeared in their defence; and, yielding to gratitude, ever ſtrike at that very liberty, the defender of which they mean to vindicate.</p>
               <p>As Timoleon, charged with miſdemeanors by ſome orators of Syracuſa, was ſummoned to appear before the people to clear himſelf, his fellow citizens were on the point of tearing his accuſers to pieces<note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch. in Vita Timoleon.</note>.</p>
               <p>In order to maintain themſelves free, the people ought never to ſuffer the law to be made deluſive; but they oftentimes obſtinately violate it in favour of thoſe they reſpect. Zaleuchus, legiſlator of the Locrians, having enacted a ſevere law againſt adultery, and his own
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0044000700:247"/>ſon being ſoon after convicted of that crime, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moved by the paternal ſorrow, repeatedly entreated his pardon.</p>
               <p>How many times, with a view to ſecure their liberty, have the people truſted in the Prince's own hands a tyrannic ſway? The perſecutions of the Proteſtant ſubjects under Mary I. rendered her domination odious. Accordingly, when Elizabeth mounted the throne, as ſhe profeſſed the reformed religion, the people, tranſported by an indiſcreet zeal, veſted her with an extenſive power to extirpate papiſm; but the fear of religious perſecutions was ſoon changed into fear of civil ſlavery, and the proteſtants with regret felt themſelves cruſhed under the weight of that power they had erected to cruſh their enemies.</p>
               <p>Nay, in order to reform the government or vindicate the ſtate, they have truſted a few individuals with an abſolute power! Of this the Decemviri, Marius, and Sylla, are famous inſtances. Veſted with the whole power of the commonwealth, Rome beheld with aſtoniſhment the authority it had intruſted them with: in their preſence the people caſt their eyes down, the laws laid in ſilence, the names of the proſcribed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded every where, and blood was ſhed in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0044000700:248"/>The Dutch, delivered from the domination of their maſter by the death of William II. again truſted the ſupreme authority into the hands of his ſon, murdered the zealous patriots who oppoſed ſuch a raſh ſtep, and again erected a Prince againſt liberty.</p>
               <p>Have we not ourſelves many times forged our chains? When the people, incenſed by the tax of three groats impoſed by Richard II. on every perſon, male or female, above fifteen years of age, had riſen againſt their oppreſſors, reſolutely bent to better their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they required the abolition of ſlavery, freedom of commerce in market-towns without tolls or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, and a fixed rent on lands, inſtead of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices due by villenage. All theſe requeſts were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, and charters to that purpoſe were granted them. Soon after the nobility and gentry, hearing of theſe tranſactions, flocked to London with their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and retainers, Richard took the field, the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of enfranchiſement were revoked by parliament, and the inferior claſs of people were reduced to the ſame ſlaviſh condition as before<note n="*" place="bottom">Froiſſart, liv. ii. cap. 77.</note>.</p>
               <p>The parliament, like a vile inſtrument deſtined to enlarge royal authority, ſubjected the whole nation to Henry VIII. in the moſt ſcandalous manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0044000700:249"/>At firſt they conferred on the King the title of the only ſupreme head on earth of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and inveſted him with all the real power belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, or rather, acknowledged his pretended inherent power "To viſit, repreſs, redreſs, reform, correct, reſtrain, and amend all errors, hereſies, abuſes, offences, contempt, and enormities, which fall under any ſpiritual authority and juriſdiction;" and, as if it was not enough to truſt him with theſe terrible wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, they paſſed a law by which they ratified all the tenets which the commiſſion, appointed by the crown to chuſe a religion for the people, ſhould eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh with the king's conſent, not being aſhamed of expreſly declaring that they had no other rule in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious concerns but the arbitrary will of their maſter.</p>
               <p>Having thus reſigned all their eccleſiaſtical liberties, they proceeded to an entire ſurrender of their civil rights; and, without ſcruple or deliberation, made, by one act, a total ſubverſion of the Engliſh conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;—they gave to the king's proclamations the ſame force as to ſtatutes enacted by parliament<note n="*" place="bottom">31 Hen. VIII. cap. 8.</note>; they even framed this law as if it were only intended to explain the natural extent of royal authority, and to facilitate the execution of it, appointed that any one of the king's councellors ſhould form a legal court for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0044000700:250"/>all diſobedience to proclamations. But to prove the more ready to gratify even the moſt lawleſs paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the King, they ratified his divorce from Anne Boleyn, declared the iſſue of their marriage illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, ſettled the crown on the king's iſſue by his new miſtreſs, and in caſe he ſhould die without children, empowered him, by his will or letters patent, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the crown. Not ſatisfied with this ſcandalous proſtitution to the will of the monarch, a ſpecies of civil inquiſition was eſtabliſhed over the kingdom. Whoever refuſed to anſwer upon oath to any article of the act of ſettlement, was declared guilty of high treaſon.</p>
               <p>But there are in our hiſtory other inſtances of baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtill more humiliating.</p>
               <p>When Charles II. was recalled to the crown, with what eagerneſs did every order of the people run to meet him, and endeavour to outvie each other in their aſſurance of loyalty!</p>
               <p>The nobility, papiſts, and tories, united in their inſult over an aſſembly, whoſe patriotic ſpirit had hitherto foiled their combined efforts to reduce their country under the yoke of ancient tyranny, and celebrated the happy event. The preſbyterians, ſtupidly imagining they were exulting in their own triumph, cordially joined their voice; the patriotic party themſelves,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0044000700:251"/>giving up all thoſe liberties they had purchaſed at the expence of their blood, imitated the crowd.</p>
               <p>Every one was buſy in removing whatever might offend the eyes of their new maſter: the arms of the commonwealth were pulled down, and thoſe of the King put up in their place; the Scotch colours taken at Dunbar and Worceſter were removed, and the great ſeals broken: whatever bore any ſtamp of liberty, or revived any idea of independance, was deſtroyed, and public thankſgivings were ordered.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was the Prince landed, but the people from every quarter of the kingdom flocked to him; the ſenate of the nation threw themſelves at his feet; he entered the capital in pomp amidſt public acclamations; rejoicings and illuminations were ſeen every where, whilſt in the tranſports of their joy, the ſtupid multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude curſed the names of thoſe who had ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them of a King, threw in the flames the ſad remains of the commonwealth, and racked their groſs imaginations for invention to inſult a government by whoſe paternal regard they could only hope to have been emancipated from that abject ſtate of ſervitude they were ſubject to.</p>
               <p>Hardly was the Prince aſcended the throne, but the parliament deemed as the moſt execrable rebels, the oppoſers of Charles the Firſt's uſurpations: they
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0044000700:252"/>decreed proſcription, confiſcation or impriſonment againſt the members of the tribunal that had ſentenced the tyrant. By their order the bodies of Cromwell, Ireton, Bradſhaw, and Pride, were taken out of their graves, drawn upon an hurdle to Tyburn, hanged there, and then buried under the gallows. By their order, the walls of Glouceſter, Coventry, Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Leiceſter,—towns which had diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their zeal for parliament, were raſed to the ground.</p>
               <p>Not ſatisfied with reſtoring Charles to his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the parliament proceeded to inveſt him with an unlimited power. Having ſettled on the King a greater revenue than that of his predeceſſor, they paſſed an act declaring the right of diſpoſing of the militia and land forces to be in the king's hands only; recalled, at his deſire, the triennial bill; enacted a law to prevent diſaffected perſons from being admitted into office, to have the ſucceſſion of corporations per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated in the hands of the creatures of the court, and to oblige all their officers to take a new oath of allegiance and ſupremacy, declaring it unlawful, upon any pretence whatſoever, to riſe in arms againſt the king, or thoſe commiſſioned by him.</p>
               <p>They veſted in the crown new prerogatives, and did not ceaſe to enlarge its authority, till they themſelves,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0044000700:253"/>cruſhed under the weight of that power they had erected, beheld with trembling the work of their own hands.</p>
               <p>But, as if ever fated through want of knowledge or virtue to effect their own miſery, one idol was no ſooner fallen down, but our forefathers erected another, and adored it with greater devotion.</p>
               <p>As James II. aſcended the throne, the parliament earneſtly cringed at his feet, and amidſt the ſeveral tokens of zeal they diſplayed for him, it was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which of both houſes was moſt earneſt to run to ſlavery. The lower houſe voted that all the revenue enjoyed by the late King ſhould be granted to his majeſty during life; and thus ſettling upon him an immenſe revenue, enabled the crown to maintain an army and fleet without the aſſiſtance of the people, and ſubdue thoſe who ſhould dare to oppoſe: whilſt the upper houſe, at the requeſt of the attorney-general, entirely diſcharged the earl of Danby, and the popiſh lords who, upon indictment, had been pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in the Tower for the plot, annulled their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer order<note n="*" place="bottom">Of the 19th of March, 1678.</note>, and brought in a bill to reverſe the attainder of the viſcount Stafford in the year 1680.</p>
               <p>On their ſide, all the magiſtrates, judges, juſtices of the peace, ſerved the king his own way, and as if
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0044000700:254"/>thoſe who were appointed to hold the balance of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice would leave no right in the ſtate, they gave it as their opinion, THAT THE LAWS OF ENGLAND ARE THE KING'S LAWS, AND THAT IT IS A PREROGATIVE OF THE CROWN TO DISPENSE WITH THEM.</p>
               <p>The clergy of the church of England, likewiſe, diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their devotion to the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of the court. The pulpit every where refounded with the doctrine of paſſive obedience; and this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was ſupported in the courts of juſtice by the judges and lawyers to the utmoſt of their power.</p>
               <p>At length, to render at once the King abſolute, all the corporations in the kingdom made a general ſurrender of their charters, and abandoned themſelves to his mercy.</p>
               <p>Thus, except a few men of a ſound underſtanding, and exalted mind, the people are commonly compoſed of ſimple and timid perſons, ever ready to accelerate their own ſervitude.</p>

               <p>AS ſoon as the Prince has uſurped the ſupreme power, the object of all public undertakings is no more the welfare of the people, but the diſplay of his authority, of the dignity of his crown, or the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his pride and caprice. Hence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the ſtate as his patrimony, and the public money as his revenue; he ſells offices and dignities, traffics away towns, provinces, ſubjects, and diſpoſes at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all the national forces.</p>
               <p>If incenſed at ſuch outrages, the people utter aloud complaints, the Prince pulls off the maſk, aſſumes the imperious ſtile of a maſter, orders them to be ſubmiſſive, and to their remonſtrances anſwers, <hi>Such is our good pleaſure.</hi> If he meets with oppoſition; he ſpeaks but of puniſhing the audacity of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Complaints are then uſeleſs, and as the Prince has ſecured his authority, whatever be his arbitrary mandates, there remains only paſſive obedience.</p>
               <p>Already public liberty exiſts no more, the Prince is all, and the nation nothing; however certain indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, corporations, or orders of people, ſtill retain
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0044000700:256"/>particular privileges, which ſtand in his way, and as ſo many barriers, confine his power within certain limits.</p>
               <p>When once the legiſlative power is veſted in the crown, the Prince labours to become abſolute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds with concern the enemies of his iniquitous empire, and makes away with them: he ſees with a jealous eye thoſe who ſtill retain perſonal preeminences, and is earneſt to deprive them of their prerogatives; he reſtrains the privileges of corporations, uſurps thoſe of towns, and adds oftentimes mockery to injury. Thus James II. having extorted from his ſubjects their charters, returned them thanks in a proclamation for the great confidence they had repoſed in him; adding, that he, for that mark of honour, thought himſelf more than ordinarily obliged to continue as he had hitherto begun, to ſhew the greateſt moderation and benignity in the exerciſe of ſo great a truſt.</p>
               <p>When the Prince is arrived at this point, his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has no limits; every day he ventures on new ſteps towards extending his power; every day commits new outrages, and, if he continues to have recourſe to pretences, it is leſs from neceſſity than ſalving appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.</p>

               <p>THE Prince, having engroſſed every power which can be exerted in government, would that he were juſt; but woe to thoſe who dare ſtill to complain of his tyrannic empire. As he has ſpared no crime to get poſſeſſion of the ſupreme power, he ſpares none to maintain it. Thus, when once the chains of the people are forged, they are afterwards riveted, and riveted ſo cloſe, that the fate of their liberty is ſealed for ever.</p>
               <p>The laſt blow Princes ſtrike at liberty, is the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the conſtitution under colour of defending it, and the puniſhing as rebels thoſe who ſhould attempt really to defend it.</p>
               <p>Armed with the whole public force, inveſted with all authority, and interpreters of the laws, they make of them an arm defenſive and offenſive, which renders them ſacred to their ſubjects, and terrible to their enemies.</p>
               <p>If in the courts of judicature, before which the unfortunate victims of his vengeance are dragged, there is ſtill a remain of humanity, they compoſe tribunals
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0044000700:258"/>of their creatures<note n="*" place="bottom">Such were the commiſſion of trail-baton, the ſtar-chamber, the high commiſſion court, the council of York, the chambre ardente, &amp;c.</note>: The ſword of tyranny is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended over every head; and if any one dares to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, he is maſſacred in an inſtant.

               <p>Caligula wiſhed that the Roman people had but one head, that he might have the pleaſure to cut it off at a ſingle ſtroke. But why produce inſtances of this? too many unfortunately are known.</p>
