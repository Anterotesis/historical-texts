            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Regard to King <hi>George?</hi> After all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Paraſitical Stuff he has been ſo long venting about the King, which is, to honeſt Men, odious, and to the King Himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. Is this his obſerving the Legal Injunctions, (as one of his Claſs calls them) of the King upon the Clergy?</p>
            <p>Now ſhould we call upon the Miniſtry to do Juſtice upon this Incendiary, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his Majeſty, in his Juſtice to the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and in Vindication of his own Injunctions, to let this Offender be brought to condign Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: This I perſwade my ſelf his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty will not deny, or, that on the other hand, His Royal Juſtice will move him to take off thoſe Injunctions from the Clergy of the Church, which they now lye under; the Reſtraints whereof, they have, with Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to His Majeſty, ſtrictly conformed to. What juſt Complaints may the Clergy make of being hardly and unjuſtly dealt with, if ſuch a manifeſt Breach of His Majeſty's Commands ſhall not be reſented? Is it not expreſſed in the ſaid Injunctions, that the Breach thereof will incur his Royal Diſpleaſure, and that the King will give Charge to the Judges, and all their Civil Officers, to do their Duty towards prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and puniſhing ſuch as ſhall offend herein? And is it the Misfortune of the Church-Clergy
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0554300100:13"/>
only, to be capable of incurring his Majeſty's Diſpleaſure; and the Diſſenting Preachers, who, notwithſtanding they are only admitted, or ſuffer'd to Preach, by a kind Exemption, from the Puniſhment due by the Law, to Schiſmaticks and Recuſants, may, without Offence, take that very Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which the others are forbidden? What a deſolate, abandon'd Condition is the Church of <hi>England</hi> brought to, if this be her Fate? And where may we ſuppoſe this will end?</p>
            <p>But I will not perſwade any true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to entertain a Thought ſo prejudicial to the Honour of the King; neither will I preſume to ſuggeſt, that the King can hear ſuch Things (if ever His Majeſty ſhall have Opportunity to hear them,) without the utmoſt Reſentment.</p>
            <p>Unhappy is the State of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if ſuch Things can be practis'd in this Kingdom, and not one of Her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be ſo faithful to Her Intereſt, as to give a true impartial Account of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to Her Head and Sworn Defender: But there is no room to doubt but ſome will be found, who will lay theſe Things before the King, and will inform His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty who they are, that inflame and deſpiſe His Subjects, by bitter Invectives in their Sermons, and by ſcurrilous Language in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0554300100:14"/>
their Pulpits, notwithſtanding His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to the contrary; which, if done wiſely, and with Clearneſs, will ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince His Majeſty who they are that are the Cauſe of the preſent Diſſatisfaction of his Subjects, and who they are that deſire he may be the Peaceable and Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord over all his People. It can ſcarce be believ'd, that theſe Men ſhould make any Impreſſion on His Majeſty, by this way of Preaching and Printing; but ſurely a faithful Account given to him of this Behaviour, in Defiance of his Injunction, muſt make Impreſſion on his Mind, very much to their Prejudice, and no leſs to the Advantage of the publick Peace, both in Church and State. Mean time, thoſe who think that this Management of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is becoming either the Perſon of this <hi>Bradbury,</hi> who calls himſelf a Miniſter, or his Friends, the Diſſenters, <hi>quatenus</hi> Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and tolerated by the Church, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him to proceed as he has begun; but a Time may come, when they may ſee themſelves miſtaken, and may find they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably diſcover'd the bloody Diſpoſition to be ſo much their own: There are many among the Diſſenters, who are ſenſible of it already, and are only wanting, in that they do not think fit to do themſelves the Juſtice to declare their Minds, which is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0554300100:15"/>
their Fear of the People, and leſt they ſhould be caſt out of the Synagogue, <hi>Loving the Praiſe of Men more,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From this Preaching Incendiary, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Lay-Preacher <hi>B<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Were this Demand made by a leſs fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Villain, one that had not been the Shame, as well as Grief of his Father; the Scandal of his Family, and the Contempt of Men of Honour; or had it been by one who had not ſent his Right Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Her late Majeſty, to beg Mercy for him, and to entreat Her Majeſty that a Juſt Proſecution might be ſtop'd, which was iſſued againſt him, for inſulting Her Royal Perſon and Government, which Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, the very ſame Perſons, whoſe Bloods he now thirſts after, were earneſt Suiters to the Queen to accept, and promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Her Native Clemency to Pardon a Man whom his own Father had nothing to ſay for, but meerly to ask it of her Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0554300100:16"/>
the ſame Grace and Goodneſs which led Her to ſpare many more, who now ſtamp upon Her Memory, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Ingratitude and Contempt. Was this Demand, I ſay, made by one who had not thus been in Debt to the Men he would deſtroy, ſome Room would have been left to believe, there might have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Publick Spirited Zeal in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however extravagant in itſelf, and however it might be carried beyond the Bounds of Chriſtianity and Honour.</p>
            <p>But, when a Man is put into a Rage by Envy, and in the height of a Party Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, calls out for Blood, and demands the Heads of ſuch as he and his Fellow Furies have thought fit to preſcribe, it is Time then to let the World know the Meaning of theſe Things, and what is to be ſaid, or done in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>The Actions of every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man are to be enquir'd into by Legal Proceſs; heard in due Form, and judg'd by the proper Perſons. It is Criminal for any One to tamper with the Juries, who are to paſs upon any Man in Caſes of Life and Death; to offer to Bribe, or Pre-poſſeſs them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Acquit or Condemn; it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore allowed for any Man to enter upon his own Vindication in Publick, while his Caſe is depending in any Court of Juſtice,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0554300100:17"/>
becauſe it is anticipating his Tryal, and a pre-poſſeſſing the People out of whom his Jury is to be Choſen, and conſequently pre-poſſeſſing and tampering with the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry itſelf, in like manner, ought not to be allowed: That Men who are liable to be queſtion'd, in Publick, for any Actions which they may have done, which are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be Illegal, ſhould be arraigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hand in Publick, by every Lewd Scribler, who, in this reſpect, pre-poſſeſſes the World againſt them as much as in him lies; find him Guilty before he is Tryed, and Execute him as it were in Effigie: When ſuch Methods are made uſe of to make Men publickly Obnoxious, it is a plain over awing thoſe, who may come to paſs upon theſe Men for Life or Death, who are made afraid to do Juſtice, leaſt they are mark'd out for the ſame popular Hatred. What, but this, is the real De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of theſe Men? They are for pre-poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the whole Nation with ſuch Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Guilt of the laſt Miniſtry, That whoſoever ſhall not find them Guilty when Impeach'd, or ſhall not be forward to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach them, ſhall be in danger of having his Houſe pull'd down by the Rabble, and of being ſet upon, in the Streets, on every Tumultuous Occaſion.</p>

            <p>The Ignorant young Man, now ſpeaking of, has but one Thing in the whole Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, which he has Publiſh'd, that has Weight in it; and this is, That he ſays, <hi>All the Executors of a Sovereign's Illegal Orders, from a Plenipotentiary, down to a Conſtable, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for their Execution of them.</hi> This, I ſay, is all that has Weight in his Book,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0554300100:19"/>
and this is what every Old Woman in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks knows, and could have ſaid as well as he.

               </gap> better, to ſhew one illegal Order of Her Majeſties which they have executed.</p>
            <p>After all that this ſcurrilous mad Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has ſaid, to provoke his Readers to the ſame height with himſelf, one would have thought he ſhould have given an Inſtance of, at leaſt, one Illegal Order iſſued by Her Majeſty, and executed by Her Miniſtry, upon which they are to <hi>expect</hi> their Heads; and I ſearch'd narrowly for it, but could not find the leaſt appearance thereof, which juſtifies fully the Liberty I take with theſe Two Scriblers, in ſaying, it is not Juſtice, but Blood which they hunt after; and leaſt they ſhould fail of obtaining the Heads of theſe Men, by the Courſe of a Juſt Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, they are thus raiſing a Flame in the Minds of the People againſt them, That, if poſſible, they may Awe the World, not only into the Impeachment, but into the Verdict; and may ſignifie, that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall diſſent, ſhall be mark'd by the People to be ſacrific'd by them upon the firſt Occaſion. What is this but <hi>Blood,</hi> as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0554300100:20"/>
in my Title? And, how can the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bear this, without ſhewing a juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, or making Men fear that they are in worſe Circumſtances, than, it is hoped, they ever will be.</p>
            <p>I know that there is a Deſign in theſe Men, that looks another way; and ſome of them have had Weakneſs enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray the Folly, <hi>viz.</hi> They hope by this popular Rage to intimidate the Perſons they threaten, and filling them with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of not obtaining a fair and juſt Tryal, oblige them to abſent themſelves, and reſerve their Defence for better Times. It is true, had the Perſons Concern'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to expect, but what theſe envenom'd Spirits would do; had they not a firm and fix'd Aſſurance that they can neither prove the Charge, nor influence the Houſe of Peers to condemn Men without Guilt, and without fair Hearing; were it not for this, it muſt be confeſs'd, it would be a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not to be accounted for, That any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Men ſhould put themſelves into their Hands; but hitherto they have not been able to obtain that Point. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſtand fairly, and are ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves fairly; and if they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, it may, with much more Juſtice and Modeſty be ſaid, That the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land expect</hi> they ſhould be heard fairly, and

            <p>The Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> now of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> is an Awful Aſſembly; and it is hoped, they will not permit themſelves to be driven, any more than led into any Thing, which their own Wiſdom does not ſatisfie them, is for the good of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

It behoves the Government to take Care that they have no wrong done them; I ſay, it behoves the Government, for in ſuch Caſes, every Man, who gives himſelf up to the Law, is under the King's Protection in a more particular manner than an another Perſon is; for this Reaſon, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who have been deſtroy'd in the Tower or in any other Priſons, it hath been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed greatly to caſt Reproach upon the King himſelf; ſeeing a Man impriſon'd is taken out of his own Protection, depriv'd of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to defend himſelf, and therefore is in the eſpecial Protection of the Prince: This was alledg'd by the Lawyers as a great Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the Crime, in the Murther of Sir <hi>Tho.

            </p>
            <p>If the People who Rail in this horrid manner, had nothing to deſire but Juſtice, they would not make ſo great a Buſtle on that account: For why ſhould they doubt of obtaining Juſtice? It is a great Affront to the King, and Miniſtry now in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they ſhould make ſo great Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours for obtaining <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as if they found themſelves in danger of failing thereof; and that <hi>Juſtice</hi> would not take place, unleſs <hi>in Terrorem,</hi> the Miniſtry were told publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the People <hi>expect it</hi>; implying, that the People will Reſent it, if it is not done: I will not give any Credit to that ſcandalous Suppoſition, That the preſent Miniſtry have deſir'd theſe Men to make publick Clamours for Impeachments, that they may have it to alledge, that they were obliged to do it, by the general Demand of the People: It is a Scandalous Reflection on the Miniſters of State, and Merits to be expos'd: If there are Crimes ſufficient to warrant an Impeachment of any Men in the Kingdom, the Miniſtry have given no ground to any, to ſupect they are backward to do their Country Juſtice; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting

            <p>There remains but one Thing more in his Clamour, <hi>viz.</hi> Their being <hi>concern'd with the Pretender.</hi> Of this he offers no Facts, no Evidence, no, nor Circumſtances, to make good the Charge which he brings; yet <hi>the Blood</hi> of the Queen's Servants muſt ſatisfy his inexorable Party; and ſuch is the prepoſterous Rage of theſe Men, that it betrays them to groſs Abſurdity, eſpecially this, That they ſhould threaten the preſent Miniſtry, if they do not impeach, <hi>&amp;c</hi>

on them, <hi>per fas aut Nefas,</hi> and to caſt them by Number of Voices, Whether they are guilty, or not guilty?</p>
            <p>To conclude, there ſeems to be the Height of Malice and Party-Rage in all theſe Things, and nothing of Juſtice is concern'd in it; the Temper is helliſh; the Men ſcandalous; they are a Satyr upon themſelves, and all good Men abhor them: The doing Juſtice on Offenders none can oppoſe, neither is any thing in this Tract offer'd againſt it; but let not Juſtice be pretended, and the Pretence be made a Stalking-Horſe, to introduce the private Revenge of diſobliged Perſons, or Parties; let not Publick Juſtice be hackney'd out to Men of no Principles; this will bring inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood upon the Nation, and who knows when the Thirſt will be quenched?</p>
            <p>The King is a Prince of Wiſdom and Prudence, and it is hop'd he will ſhew that Moderation in the midſt of theſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Extremes, as may preſerve the Peace of his People, and prevent that <hi>Cannibal</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which would ſet one half of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to devour the other; and it is eſpecially hoped, His Majeſty will take the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which he has ſworn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
