            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE diſputes which have taken place in the learned world, reſpecting thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems which were publiſhed ſome time ago under the names of Rowley and Canning, are ſtill undetermined; notwithſtanding all the arguments brought on one ſide to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their authenticity, and on the other to prove them the forgeries of a young li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary adventurer, the queſtion is ſtill brought to no concluſion, and as the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans of each hypotheſis declare themſelves unconvinced by the evidences of the other, the matter may be conſidered as yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in doubt and obſcurity. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing collection of pieces are liable to none of the objections which are made to the other. They are the genuine and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0536900400:8"/>
productions of Thomas Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton; a perſon whoſe genius and abilities, exerciſed at a very early period of life, will no leſs command the reſpect of poſterity, than they have excited the attention, and divided the ſentiments of the ableſt judge of the preſent age.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to Rowley's poems, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing opinion ſeems to be, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> they were actually written by Chatterton: for though the antique manner in which they were cloathed, had ſerved greatly to diſguiſe them, yet it could not but be obſerved that that the ſmoothneſs of the verſification, and the frequent <note n="*" place="bottom">The argument ariſing from the coincidences which might be pointed out between the ſuppoſed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient poems and later writers, hath not been attended to in the manner it deſerves. It would be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive than any other yet made uſe of. Let any perſon compare the parallel paſſages lately pointed out by a writer in the St. James's Chronicle, No. 2671, May 21, 1778, and at the ſame time advert to the rules laid down by biſhop Hurd, for the diſcovery of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and he will not heſitate to acknowledge, that the writer of Rowley's poems certainly lived in the preſent century. As this letter will be conſidered as a curioſity by all who intereſt themſelves concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authenticity of thoſe poems, and as it is not readily to be referred to, being printed only in a news-paper, we have ſubjoined it to the preſent publication.<note n="†" place="bottom">See page xxiv.</note>

               </gap>ld be attempted by one who had not reached the age of ſeventeen years, and that theſe attempts ſhould be conducted with a degree of ſkill and judgment, which obliged the moſt intelligent to doubt, and
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0536900400:10"/>
at the ſame time almoſt compelled the moſt doubtful to aſſent, ſeemed to be hardly within the reach of probability; it rather, in the opinion of many, bordered on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impoſſibility.</p>
            <p>It hath been preſumed, though without du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighing circumſtances, that it would be a wild conjecture to ſuppoſe a young, and almoſt uneducated man, was capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting a complicated fraud, which required applications very different from thoſe which the ſeaſon of his life, and his means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſeemed to point out, and at the ſame time ſuch a courſe of ſtudy as is very ſeldom purſued until a more advanced pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. But before this is granted, it ſhould be recollected that he was, as Mr. Warton<note n="*" place="bottom">Additions to Hiſtory of Poetry, vol. II.</note> obſerve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a ſingular inſtance of a prematurity</hi>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0536900400:11"/>
               <hi>of abilities, and that he had acquired a ſtore of general information far exceeding his years; that he poſſeſſed a comprehenſion of mind, and activity of underſtanding, which predominated over his ſituations in life, and his opportunities of inſtruction.</hi> When theſe facts are remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, it will not be conſidered ſo very incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; and the hiſtory of the human mind will furniſh many examples of a maturity of judgment in perſons at as early an age, which will diminiſh the ſurpriſe which muſt at the firſt glance impreſs every perſon who reflects upon this extraordinary phenomenon. It ſhould be recollected, before we pronouce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſively upon this ſubject, that there have been inſtances almoſt as extraordinary as that we have now under conſideration. Dr. Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, at the age of ſix years, acquired a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable knowledge in the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew tongues; and Dr. Johnſon
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0536900400:12"/>
has given the life of one<note n="*" place="bottom">John Phillip Barretier.</note> who maſtered five languages at the age of nine years. Theſe acquiſitions are certainly as wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as Chatterton's knowledge of the obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete language of the 15th and 16th centuries, which he was known to be fond of, and to which he had particularly applied his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor ſhould the contrivance of ſuch a fraud be deemed beyond the reach of one who poſſeſſed ſuch abilities. It is known that a perſon who was diſtinguiſhed by the name of Pſalmanazar, in the beginning of the preſent century, fabricated a new language, and actually ſucceeded in impoſing upon ſome of the moſt intelligent and inquiſitive perſons of the times, who were equally as deſirous, as able to detect the impoſture, had it not been managed with a degree of art which eluded all their vigilance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0536900400:13"/>
It will hardly be denied, that acquiſitions like thoſe we have before mentioned are equally ſurpriſing with any which Chatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton is ſuppoſed to have reached; unleſs the invention of new characters for a language, or the difficulties of obtaining an accurate knowledge of the Latin, Greek, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, are more eaſy to overcome than to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the manner of writing in the time of Edward the fourth. But inſtances may be produced of perſons whoſe extent of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence hath been as great in ſubjects more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe, and not leſs out of the common walk, than thoſe to which Chatterton devoted his attention. It will be ſufficient to name the celebrated Crichton, and M. Servin, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Sully, between both whom and our author a reſemblance might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, as well in their aſtoniſhing abilities, as in thoſe defects which marked the private
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0536900400:14"/>
characters of each of theſe young adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
            <p>As the preſent publication conſiſts of pieces of which not the ſmalleſt doubt was ever entertained of their being genuine, it is totally unneceſſary here to enter into any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument either to ſupport or invalidate thoſe proofs which have been adduced of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity of the ſuppoſed ancient poems; and it is the leſs incumbent on the preſent editor, as the public hath lately received en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſatisfaction on that head from the ſame gentleman to whom we are indebted for the firſt collection of this writer's works. It may not however be unneceſſary to add a few words, in order to compleat the ſhort account given by that gentleman of ſo extraordinary a perſonage, who may be conſidered as the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary phenomenon of the times, and whoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, if it had been properly foſtered and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, might have carried Engliſh litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0536900400:15"/>
to as high a pitch as any author in the preſent century. One can ſcarce avoid draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a parallel upon the preſent occaſion, from the ſimilarity of circumſtances between our author and the great father of the Engliſh ſtage; the one obliged to cramp and abaſe his genius to the ideas and taſte of a barbarous audience; the other, from neceſſity, compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to obey the mandates of the directers of our monthly publications, equally dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, ignorant and inſipid.</p>
            <p>The former editor hath already ſet forth the few circumſtances, relative to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, which he poſſeſſed in common, with other men. The time of his birth, and death; the names of his parents, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and the confined mode of his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are all accurately ſtated. It is to be regretted, that he permitted, the <hi>ſang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froid</hi> of the antiquary, to repreſs, that
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0536900400:16"/>
warmth, which the excellence of his author might have been expected to excite; ſurely, that excellence demanded ſome few words of commendation: it is alſo to be lamented that he did not enter more minutely into the diſpoſition and circumſtances of one whom he could not but reſpect as an author, however he might diſlike his chararacter, as a man: and here it muſt be confeſſed, Chatterton appears to us in the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e point of view. He poſſeſſed all the vices and irregularities of youth, and his profligacy was, at leaſt, as conſpicuous as his abilities. Although he was of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion which might be ſaid to accelerate his purſuits in antiquities, yet ſo averſe was he to that profeſſion, that he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver overcome it. One of his firſt efforts, to emerge from a ſituation ſo irkſome to him, was an application to a gentleman well known in the republic of letters;
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0536900400:17"/>
which unfortunately for the public, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, met with a very cold reception; and which the diſappointed author always ſpoke of with a high degree of acrimony, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was mentioned to him.</p>
            <p>After his quitting Briſtol, he was engaged to aſſiſt Mr. Northhook, in a hiſtory of London, then publiſhing in numbers, and, at the ſame time, was daily writing ſome piece for the magazines. Every effort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been inſufficient to ward off the approach of poverty; and very ſoon after he ſettled in London, his diſtreſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo great, that he meditated a deſign of going to Senegal. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Poem to Miſs Buſh page 85.</note> This intention was never executed. He continued drudging for the bookſellers a few months, when at laſt, oppreſſed with poverty and diſeaſe, in
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0536900400:18"/>
a fit of deſpair, he put an end to his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the month of Auguſt 1770, with a doſe of poiſon.</p>
            <p>Such was the wretched life, and ſuch the fatal end, of one who, had he not prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely finiſhed his days, had bidden fair to do the higheſt honours to Engliſh litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The reader will anticipate every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of regret which can be made upon this occaſion; and while he ſympathizes with the unfortunate, he will lament that one who is allowed to have been, as Mr. Warton expreſſes it, <q rend="inline">"a prodigy of genius,"</q> ſhould, by the mere dint of diſtreſs, be tempted to rid himſelf of an inſupportable exiſtence. He will feel himſelf hurt at the idea that no notice ſhould be taken of one who the laſt mentioned writer pronounces would have proved the firſt of Engliſh po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, had he reached a maturer age; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:0536900400:19"/>
he may feel ſome indignation againſt the perſon to whom his firſt application was made, and by whom he was treated with neglect and contempt. It were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the public was fully informed of all the circumſtances attending that unhappy application; the event of which deprived the world of works which might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the honour of the nation, as well as the comfort and happineſs of their unfortunate author.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved, by the elegant writer before quoted, that ſome of the verſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the following miſcellany, which are thoſe written by their author <hi>without any deſign to deceive, have been judged to be moſt aſtoniſhing productions by the firſt critic of the preſent age.</hi> After ſuch a judgment it cannot be mentioned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exciting wonder, that writings which
<pb facs="tcp:0536900400:20"/>
deſerve ſuch a character, ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue undiſtinguiſhed amidſt the traſh of monthly compilations. A ſtriking ſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may be obſerved between them and their author, both having met with a fate very unworthy their merit, equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and deſpiſed; he, living and dying in obſcurity; they, remaining neglected and almoſt unknown.</p>
            <p>That they may hereafter ſtand a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the application and abilities of an unfortunate man, untimely loſt to himſelf and to the public, one who had a ſlight knowledge of him in his life time, but not enough to be acquainted with his merits, until too late, who conſiders the neglect which hath been ſhewn to theſe his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged works, as an imputation on the taſte and curioſity of the age, hath employed a few leiſure hours in collecting the following
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:0536900400:21"/>
miſcellany, which he truſts, after ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable opinions as are before quoted, will not require either excuſe or apology, but on the contrary, will entitle him to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of thoſe readers whoſe candour will induce them to applaud the marks of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius which may be found herein, and at the ſame time make every due allowance for thoſe imperfections which haſte, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy circumſtances in which many of them were written, would have given the author, had he been living, a title to expect and demand.</p>

            <p>AFTER the opinion which the reverend Mr. Thomas Warton has delivered, concerning the authenticity of the poems attributed to Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, it may be expected that thoſe who maintain a contrary doctrine, ſhould publiſh ſome arguments in ſupport of it. For my part I ſhall rather employ memory than ſagacity on this ſubject, and have no weight to throw into either ſcale, except the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing parallels; obſerving at the ſame time, how extraordinary it is that ſo many coincidences ſhould be diſcoverable between Shakeſpeare, Dryden, &amp;c. and Rowley, whoſe name was never heard of till within theſe ten years paſt.</p>

            <p>'TIS not for thee, O man! to murmur at the will of the Almighty. When the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders roar, the lightnings ſhine on the riſing waves, and the black clouds ſit on the brow of the lofty hill; who then protects the flying deer, ſwift as a ſable cloud, toſt by the whiſtling winds, leaping over the rolling floods, to gain the hoary wood: whilſt the lightnings ſhine on his cheſt, and the wind rides over his horns? When the wolf roars; terrible as the voice of the Severn; moving ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic as the nodding foreſts on the brow of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel-ſtow; who then commands the ſheep to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſwain, as the beams of light attend upon the morning?—Know, O man! That God ſuffers not the leaſt member of his work to periſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anſwering the purpoſe of their creation. The evils of life, with ſome, are bleſſings: and the plant of death healeth the wound of the ſword.—Doth the ſea of trouble and affliction overwhelm thy ſoul, look unto the Lord, thou ſhalt ſtand

            <p>Comely as the white rocks; bright as the ſtar of the evening; tall as the oak upon the brow of the mountain; ſoft as the ſhowers of dew, that fall upon the flowers of the field, Ethelgar aroſe, the glory of <note n="*" place="bottom">Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

ſweet as the morning breeze; beauteous as the ſun; bluſhing like the vines of the weſt; her ſoul as fair as the azure curtain of heaven. She ſaw Ethelgar; her ſoft ſoul melted as the flying ſnow before the ſun. The ſhrine of St. Cuthbert united them. The minutes fled on the golden wings of bliſs. Nine horned moons had decked the ſky, when Aelgar ſaw the light; he was like a young plant upon the mountain's ſide, or the ſun hid in a cloud; he felt the ſtrength of his fire; and, ſwift as the lightnings of Heaven, purſued the wild boar of the wood. The morn awoke the ſun; who, ſtepping from the mountain's brow, ſhook his ruddy locks upon the ſhining dew; Aelgar aroſe from ſleep; he ſeized his ſword and ſpear, and iſſued to the chace. As waters ſwiftly falling down a craggy rock, ſo raged young Aelgar thro' the wood; the wild boar bit his ſpear, and the fox died at his feet. From the thicket a wolf aroſe, his eyes flaming like two ſtars; he roared like the voice of the tempeſt; hunger made him furious, and and he fled like a falling meteor to the war. Like a thunderbolt tearing the black rock, Aelgar darted his ſpear through his heart. The wolf raged like the voice of many waters, and ſeizing Aelgar by by the throat, he ſought the regions of the bleſſed.—The wolf died upon his body.—Ethelgar and

Egwina wept.—They wept like the rains of the ſpring; ſorrow ſat upon them as the black clouds upon the mountains of death: but the power of God ſettled their hearts.</p>
            <p>The golden ſun aroſe to the higheſt of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; the apple perfumed the gale; and the juicy grape delighted the eye. Ethelgar and Egwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na bent their way to the mountain's ſide, like two ſtars that move through the ſky. The flowers grew beneath their feet; the trees ſpread out their leaves; the ſun played upon the rolling brook; the winds gently paſſed along. Dark, pitchy clouds veiled the face of the ſun; the winds roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like the noiſe of a battle; the ſwift hail de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the ground; the lightnings broke from the ſable clouds, and gilded the dark brown cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the ſky; the thunder ſhook the lofty moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; the tall towers nodded to their foundations; the bending oaks divided the whiſtling wind; the broken flowers fled in confuſion round the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's ſide. Ethelgar and Egwina ſought the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſhade, the bleak winds roared over their heads, and the waters ran over their feet. Swift from the dark cloud the lightning came; the ſkies bluſhed at the ſight. Egwina ſtood on the brow of the lofty hill, like an oak in the ſpring; the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings

danced about her garments, and the blaſting flame blackened her face: the ſhades of death ſwam before her eyes; and ſhe fell breathleſs down the black ſteep rock: the ſea received her body, and ſhe rolled down with the roaring water.</p>
            <p>Ethelgar ſtood terrible as the mountain of Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dip; the waves of deſpair harrowed up his ſoul, as the roaring Severn plows the ſable ſand; wild as the evening wolf, his eyes ſhone like the red vapors in the valley of the dead: horror ſat upon his brow; like a bright ſtar ſhooting through the ſky, he plunged from the lofty brow of the hill, like a tall oak breaking from the roaring wind. Saint Cuthbert appeared in the air; the black clouds fled from the ſky; the ſun gilded the ſpang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling meadows; the lofty pine ſtood ſtill; the violets of the vale gently moved to the ſoft voice of the wind; the ſun ſhone on the bubbling brook. The ſaint, arrayed in glory, caught the falling mortal; as the ſoft dew of the morning hangs upon the lofty elm, he bore him to the ſandy beech, whilſt the ſea roared beneath his feet. Ethelgar opened his eyes, like the grey orbs of the morning, folding up the black mantles of the night—Know, O man! ſaid the member of the bleſſed, to ſubmit to the will of

God; he is terrible as the face of the earth, when the waters ſunk to their habitations; gentle as the ſacred covering of the oak; ſecret as the bottom of the great deep; juſt as the rays of the morning. Learn that thou art a man, nor repine at the ſtroke of the Almighty, for God is as juſt as he is great. The holy viſion diſappeared as the atoms fly before the ſun. Ethelgar aroſe, and bent his way to the college of Kenewalein; there he flouriſhes as a hoary oak in the wood of Arden.</p>

            <p>WHEN winter yelled through the leafleſs grove; when the black waves rode over the roaring winds, and the dark-brown clouds hid the face of the ſun; when the ſilver brook ſtood ſtill, and ſnow environed the top of the lofty mountain; when the flowers appeared not in the blaſted fields, and the boughs of the leafleſs trees bent with the loads of ice; when the howling of the wolf affrighted the darkly glimmering light of the weſtern ſky; Kenrick, terrible as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, young as the ſnake of the valley, ſtrong as the mountain of the ſlain; his armour ſhining like the ſtars in the dark night, when the moon is veiled in ſable, and the blaſting winds howl over the wide plain; his ſhield like the black rock, prepared himſelf for war.</p>
            <p>Ceolwolf of the high mountain, who viewed the firſt rays of the morning ſtar, ſwift as the fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deer, ſtrong as a young oak, fierce as an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>Centwin of the vale aroſe, he ſeized the maſſy ſpear; terrible was his voice, great was his ſtrength; he hurled the rocks into the ſea, and broke the ſtrong oaks of the foreſt. Slow in the race as the minutes of impatience. His ſpear, like the fury of a thunderbolt, ſwept down whole armies; his enemies melted before him, like the ſtones of hail at the approach of the ſun.</p>
            <p>Awake, O Eldulph!

            <p>Centwin raged like a wild boar. Tatward ſported in blood, armies melted at his ſtroke. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulph was a flaming vapour, deſtruction ſat upon his ſword. Ceolwolf was drenched in gore, but fell like a rock before the ſword of Mervin.</p>

            <p>Sledda is a flame of fire. Kenbert ſcatters the never-erring ſhaft of death. Aelle is a tempeſt, a cloud burſting in blood, a winter's wind blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul: his knees are encircled with life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm gore, his white robe is like the morning ſky.

            <p>Why will ye ſleep, ye Saxons, whilſt the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mountain of fortune trembles over our heads; Let us gird on the reeking ſword, and wrap in flame the town of Doranceaſtre: ſtrong as the foundation of the earth, ſwift as the impetuous ſtream, deadly as the corrupted air, ſudden as the whirlwind piercing to the hidden bed of the ſea, armed in the red lightnings of the ſtorm, will we come upon the foe.

            <p>Turn your eyes, O ye Saxons, to the diſtant mountain: on the ſpreading top a company is ſeen; they are like the locuſts of the Eaſt, like a dark-brown cloud expanding in the wind: they come down the hills like the ſtones of hail; the javelin nods over the helm; death ſports in their ſhadows. They are children of Woden: ſee the god of battle fans the air, the red ſword waves in their banner.

Godred Crovan, ſon of Harald the Black, whoſe name has put to flight armies, ariſe.</p>
            <p>Godred aroſe; he met the chiefs on the plain; they ſat down, and feaſted till the evening: there ſat Cochlin with the long ſpear, whoſe arm is a thunderbolt: on the banks of the ſea he fought an hoſt, and rained blood on the plain of Mervor: brown is his face as the ſun-burnt heath; ſtrong his arm as the roaring ſea: he ſhook his black locks like clouds toſſed by the winds: he ſings the ſong of joy. Godwin of the ruſhy plain lay upon the ſkin of the wolf; his eyes are ſtars, his blows are lightning. Tatwallin ſat by his ſide, he ſung ſweet as the birds of ſpring, he fought like the angry lion.</p>

               <p>"The wolf of Norway beat his anlace on his ſilver ſhield; the ſons of war aſſembled around him: Swain of the cleft-hill ſhook the ſpear on his left; and Harald the Black, the lion of Iceland, on his right, dyed in gore. Fergus of the ſpreading hills was caſed in black armour; his eyes ſhone with rage, his ſword ſported with the beams of the ſun.</p>

               <p>"Swain prepares for war; he ſounds the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen helmet, his followers lift high the deadly ſpear.</p>

"Madded by defeat, Swain plunged into his band: the ſword of Edmund ſounded on his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met; their ſilver ſhields were heard upon the ſtream: the ſword of Edmund ſunk to the heart of the ſon of Egwin; he bit the bloody ſand at his feet.</p>

Upon the high hills he encountered Moryon; like daſhing waves, they ruſhed to the war; their ſwords rained blood to the valley beneath.

Son of Woden, great was thy might, by thy hand the two ſons of Oſmor fell to the valley.</p>

            <p>Dugnal, who inhabits the iſles, whoſe barks are ſwifter than the wind, ſtands on the bank of the ſtream; his eyes are bent on the ſpangling wave; his hands preſs the ſilver-headed ſpear; he is a lion in the war, in the council wiſe as the ancient prieſts.</p>

            <p>The noiſe of a multitude is heard from the hills: Godred ſets his troops in order for war; they are ſeen on the brow of the hill. Many are the foes of Godred; great is the courage of his warriors.</p>
            <p>Raignald of the iſles attends the chiefs of his foes; his arm is ſtrong as the flouriſhing oak; his wiſdom deep as the black lake; his ſwift ſhips ſlew over the waves; he defied to battle the prince of the mountains.</p>
            <p>Bladdyn fell by his hand; he burnt the palace of the wood: the horn, emboſſed with gold, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his ſpoils; he returned to his caſtle over a ſea of blood.</p>
            <p>Dunhelm bears the banner of the foe; he is the dragon of the moſſy plain; he kept the water of the ſeven ſprings. Wynfylt, and his warriors, ſought
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0536900400:58"/>
to bear away the water in the horn of hoſpitality. Dunhelm aroſe from his ſtrong fort; his anlace glittered over his head.</p>
            <p>Children of the hills, ſaid the ſon of Olave, reſtore the water to the gently-running ſtream.</p>
            <p>The ſon of Meurig anſwered not: the anlace of Dunhelm divided his head; his blows fell like the ſtones of hail, when the loud winds ſhake the top of the lofty tree; the warriors fled like the clouds of night, at the approach of the ſun.</p>
            <p>Elgar, from the borders of Northumberland, was among the enemies of Godred Crovan, ſon of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald the Black: he led his troop down the hill, and began the fight with Oſpray: like the raging of the lake of blood, when the loud winds whiſtle over the ſharp cliffs of the rock, was the noiſe of the battle.</p>
            <p>Summerled roſe in the ſight like the rays of the morning; blood beamed about him; his helmet ſell from his head; his eyes were like the lights upon the billows.</p>
            <p>Octha, who fought for Godred, oppoſed the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his rage: his ſhield was like the riſing ſun,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0536900400:59"/>
his ſpear the tower of Mabyn: the ſpear of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merled ſounded on the ſhield of Octha; he heard the ſhrill cry of joy, as the broken weapon fell to the ground: his ſword fell upon the ſhoulder of Summerled; he gnaſhed his teeth, and died.</p>
            <p>Oſpray, like a lion, ravages the band of Elgar. Octha follows behind him, dying his long white robe in blood.</p>
            <p>Elgar flies to the ſon of Vorti; his ſpear ſounds upon his helmet; the ſword of Octha divides the ſhield of Elgar: the Northumbrian warrior retires to his band. Dunhelm drives his long ſpear through the heart of Octha; he falls to the ground. Wilver ſets his foot upon his breathleſs corpſe, and buries him beneath the bodies of the foe.</p>
            <p>Raignald, with his band, flies to the relief of Dunhelm: the troops of Wilver and Oſpray ſlowly retire. Dunhelm falls by the javelin of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known warrior; ſo falls the eagle by the arrow of the child.</p>
            <p>Raignald rages like the fires of the mountain; the troops of Dugnal and Ceormond melt before him.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0536900400:60"/>
Dugnal lifts high his broad ſhield againſt the breaſt of Raignald; his ſword hangs over his head: the troops of Raignald retire with their chief. Ealward, and the ſon of Harald the Black, fly to the war: the foe retire before them. Raignald encourages his men: like an eagle he rages in the fight.</p>
            <p>The troops of Godred halt; the bands of Dugnal and Ceormond forſake their leaders.</p>
            <p>Godred retires to the bank of the Lexy; the foe followed behind, but were driven back with ſhame. On the bank of the Lexy the warriors are ſcattered like broken oaks.</p>
            <p>Godred ſounds the ſilver ſhield; the chiefs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble round his tent.</p>
            <p>Let us again to the war, O chiefs, and drive the foe over the mountains.</p>
            <p>They prepare for war; Dugnal leads the wolves of the iſle; with a loud voice they began the fight. Ealward falls by the ſword of Raignald. Cullifin ſcatters the javelins of fate. Fingal rages in the fight, but ſell by the ſword of Elgar.</p>

Cochlin heard the dying groans of his friend; his ſword pierced the heart of Elgar, he fell upon the body of Fingal.</p>
            <p>Morvor and Eſſyr raged like ſons of blood, thouſands fell around them. Godwin ſcattered ſlaughter through the hoſt of the ſoe. Tatwallin ſweeps down the chief of the battle; like the noiſe of torrents rolling down the high mountains, is the noiſe of the fight; the feet of the warriors are wet with blood; the ſword of Cochlin is broken, his ſpear pierces through the foe like lightning through the oak: the chiefs of Godred fill the field with the bodies of the dead: the night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and victory is undecided: the black clouds bend to the earth, Raignald and Godred both retire.</p>

            <p>ERE the ſun was ſeen on the brow of the mountain, the clanging ſhields were heard in the valley: our enemies were apalled at the ſound. The red armour of our warriors glittered till the noon of day. The foe fled from the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; they fell in the chace like ſtones of hail; they panted like hunted wolves.</p>
            <p>Let the Hirlas of Rhys overflow like the waters of the great river.</p>
            <p>Where the golden banners declare the valour of Rhys, had the horn of hoſpitality long been uſed: it relieved the warriors, who fainted in the chace, and the traveller whoſe habitation is beyond the white mountains.</p>
            <p>

Bring here, O cupbearer, the carved Hirlas of mirth, which glows with livid gold: let the ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mead ſlow around it.</p>

            <p>Fill the golden Hirlas of mirth; attend to the merits of the warriors, leſt they revenge on thee the diſgrace of their honour.</p>
            <p>See Gryffydh, with his uplifted crimſon ſpear, expects it; he is the bulwark of the borders: ſprung from Cynfyll and the dragons of the hill; his name ſhall ever live in the ſongs of the bards. As refreſhed with the drink of mirth, his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants fought, furious as the battle of the champions of the valley. Whilſt the tomb of Pendragon ſhall ſtand on the hill, his ſame ſhall remain in the ſong.</p>

Dreadful was the conflict as that of Bangor, when the warriors were trod to the ground. The princes fled: Morach beat the earth with his feet: Morvran fled over the mountain.</p>

            <p>Let the golden Hirlas go round to the ſeat of Morgan, whoſe name ſhall be heard in the ſongs of our children: the ſight of his uſeleſs ſword blaſted my ſoul.</p>
            <p>Fill up the badge of honour, the golden Hirlas. To Gronwys bear it; aſtoniſhed I ſaw him ſtand like a rock on the ſpreading plain of Giveſhun; he ſuſtained the aſſault of an army. Upon the ſandy bank of the ſea his attendants did wonders. The chief of the foe was burnt in the fire of his rage, and the gleanings of the ſword were loſt in the ſtream.</p>
            <p>In the heat of the battle, the ſon of Gryffydh burſt his chains; Menrig again raged in the war. When the ſun ſat on the hill, we ſung the ſong of victory.</p>
            <p>Fill the Hirlas of mirth to all the chiefs of Oweyn, who are the wolves of the mountain. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc and Meyler are in ſoul one; they are our caſtles. The warriors of the hill ſtood round their chief,

            <p>Bear it to Daniel, beauteous as the verdure of the foreſt, ſavage as the prowling wolf.</p>
            <p>O cupbearer! great is thy ſervice, in diſplaying the merits of the warrior; if thou haſt not heard his fame, his ſpear flies to thy breaſt, and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers drink thy blood.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the lamps of joy are burning, let the Hirlas go round to the warriors who fought at Llydcomb; they fought with the rage of lions; the mead is their due: they defended Cwrys.</p>

The king of the ſwift warriors ſtarted from his couch: he ſhook like an oak through which the lightnings have cut their rapid way; his eyes rolled like the lights on the Saxons barks, in the tempeſt of the dark and black night.</p>
            <p>Exmundbert flew to his chief: he ſtruck the ſilver ſhield. Sueno of the dark lake, and the black haired Lecolwin, caught the lance and the ſhield, and preſt into the royal tent.</p>
            <p>Warriors ſtrike the ſhields of alarm; the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians are aſſembled together, the Saxons are burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our tents: give the cry of war, and iſſue to the battle: come upon them by the ſide of the thick wood, near the city of <note n="*" place="bottom">Rowceſter, in Derbyſhire, a place of great antiquity.</note>Reggaceſter.

Delward of the ſtrong arm, and Ax-bred of the foreſt of wolves, led the warriors to the thick wood: but quiet was the foreſt as the tranquil lake, when the winds ſleep on the tops of the lofty trees. The inhabitants of Reggaceſter ſlept in the ſtrength of their walls. The leaders returned.</p>
            <p>There is no enemy near, O king: ſtill as the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the dead, are the kingdoms around us: they have felt the ſtrength of thy arm, and will no more riſe up to oppoſe us.

            <p>Sudden from the borders of the wood, was the alarm given: and the ſilver ſhield rouzed the ſun from behind the black clouds. The archers of the ſacrifice dropped the bow, and caught the lance and the ſhield. Confuſion ſpread from watch-tower to watch-tower, and the clamour rung to the diſtant hills.</p>
            <p>Gorthmund raged like a wild boar, but he raged in vain: his whole army was diſordered, and the cry of war was mixed with the yell of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>

Segowald came near with his Mercians on the right-hand: and the great Sigebert led the Saxons round the thick wood.</p>

            <p>Gorthmund ſcorns to fly; he is deſcended from the ſon of battle, L'achollan, whoſe ſword put to flight the armies of Moeric, when the ſun was covered with a mantle of blood, and darkneſs deſcended upon the earth at noon day.

Lofgar never fled, though the warriors of the mountains hurled the rocks upon him in the valley, when he fought for the ſhield of Penda: and ſhould Gorthmund fly, Gorthmund, whoſe ſword was his law, who held juſtice in his banner?</p>
            <p>Segowald ſought Gorthmund: he found him ſingly encountering an army.</p>

Strong were the warriors, as the ghoſt of Cawn,</l>

            <l>Nicou, deſcended from the god of war,</l>

            <l>Vichon, the god who rul'd above the ſkies,</l>

            <l>The warrior dar'd him, ridicul'd his might,</l>
            <l>Bent his white bow, and ſummon'd him to fight.</l>
            <l>Vichon, diſdainful, bade his lightnings fly,</l>

            <l>Threw down a ſtar the armour of his feet,</l>

The waters ſtill aſcending fierce and high,</l>

            <l>There Vichon ſat; his armour on his bed,</l>
            <l>He thought Narada with the mighty dead.</l>

            <l>Head-long he falls; 'tis his own arms compel,</l>

            <l>The mighty Nicou, furious, wild and young.</l>
            <l>Who led th'em battled archers to the field,</l>

            <l>That ſhield his glorious father died to gain,</l>
            <l>When the white warriors fled along the plain:</l>
            <l>When the full ſails could not provoke the flood,</l>
            <l>Till Nicou came, and ſwell'd the ſeas with blood.</l>
            <l>Slow at the end of his robuſt array,</l>

            <l>All Nicou's friendſhip, happineſs, and joy:</l>
            <l>They ſought in vain, 'till Vicat, Vichon's ſon,</l>
            <l>Never in feats of wickedneſs outdone,</l>
            <l>Saw Nica, ſiſter to the mountain king,</l>
            <l>Dreſt beautiful, with all the flowers of ſpring:</l>
            <l>He ſaw and ſcatter'd poiſon in her eyes;</l>
            <l>From limb to limb, in varied forms he flies;</l>
            <l>Dwelt on her crimſon lip, and added grace</l>
            <l>To every gloſſy feature of her face.</l>
            <l>Roreſt was fir'd with paſſion at the ſight,</l>
            <l>Friendſhip and honour, ſunk to Vicat's right:</l>
            <l>He ſaw, he lov'd, and burning with deſire,</l>
            <l>Bore the ſoft maid from brother, ſiſter, ſire.</l>
            <l>Pining with ſorrow, Nica faded, died,</l>
            <l>Like a fair aloe in its morning pride.</l>
            <l>This brought the warrior to the bloody mead,</l>
            <l>And ſent to young Roreſt the threat'ning reed.</l>
            <l>He drew his army forth: Oh! Need I tell!</l>
            <l>That Nicou conquer'd, and the lover fell:</l>
            <l>His breathleſs army mantled all the plain;</l>
            <l>And Death ſat ſmiling on the heaps of ſlain.</l>
            <l>The battle ended, with his reeking dart,</l>
            <l>The penſive Nicou pierc'd his beating heart:</l>
            <l>And to his mourning valiant warriors cry'd,</l>
            <l>I, and my ſiſter's ghoſt are ſatisfy'd.</l>

               <l>BEFORE I ſeek the dreary ſhore,</l>
               <l>Where Gambia's rapid billows roar,</l>
               <l>And foaming pour along;</l>
               <l>To you I urge the plaintive ſtrain,</l>
               <l>And tho' a lover ſings in vain,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Ungrateful, cruel, lovely maid,</l>
               <l>Since all my torments were repaid</l>
               <l>With frowns or languid ſneers;</l>
               <l>With aſſiduities no more</l>

                  <p>THE late publication of a volume of poems, ſaid to have been written by Thomas Rowlie, in the 15th century, having given riſe to ſome ingenious criticiſms reſpecting their authenticity, I beg leave to ſend you the following fragment of a ſermon by the ſame author. It was given to me ſome time ſince by Mr. George Catcott, whoſe name has been ſo often mentioned on the preſent occaſion, and to whoſe inquiſitive diſpoſition, and very commendable zeal, the public is principally indebted for the preſervation and appearance of theſe valuable productions of antiquity. It may be neceſſary to inform you, that, when Chatterton gave this fragment to his friend, he was utterly (and ever after continued) unacquainted with any language but his mother-tongue; and that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0536900400:143"/>
the citations of theſe languages, from two antient authors, have been fully authenticated. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical talents of our bard are eſtabliſhed by the publication of his poems; but the following frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſermon on the divinity of the Holy Spirit, diſplays him in the more illuſtrious charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an orthodox divine. Every circumſtance which tends to throw light on the hiſtory of Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſhould be given to the public, and his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on ſo eſſential a point of the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by no means ſuppreſſed, notwithſtanding they may not have the ſanction of an age unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily overgrown with Arianiſm and infidelity. Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton himſelf, although he totally diſbelieved the ſubject of the fragment, had, however the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity to produce it; and I am ſorry that the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous editors had not thought it (and ſome others of Rowlie's proſe productions in their poſſeſſion) worthy of being publiſhed together with his poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal compoſitions.</p>

            <p>Sir W. Canynge had alſo a cabinet of curioſities, which he had collected with very great expence, and Rowley aſſiſted him in making the collection. The greateſt part of a large folio was filled with his compoſitions. This folio, Rowley ſays. <q rend="inline">"was a preſente wordie of a grete kynge;"</q> and the loſs of it will be ſincerely regretted by the friends of literature, as the writings might have thrown ſome light on the learning of thoſe times. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge was alſo a man of an extenſive genius, and a liberal turn of mind, the diſtinguiſhed patron of literature, and a lover of the fine arts. Rowley, it appears by his writings, lived in the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy with him, and received very extraordinary marks of his favour and generoſity. On all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions he ſhews his gratitude to his illuſtrious friend, takes perpetual delight in dwelling on his many amiable virtues, and conſtanly manifeſts an earneſt deſire of tranſmitting his fame to poſterity. This appears not only in many of his poems, but alſo in the following proſe work, preſerved by

                        <p>"I was fadre confeſſor to maſteres Roberte and maſtre William Cannings. Maſtre Robert was a man after his fadre's own harte, greedie of gaynes and ſparynge of alms deedes; but maſter William was mickle courteous, and gave me many marks in my needs. At the age of 22 years deaces'd maſter Roberte, and by maſter William's deſyre bequeathd me one hundred marks; I went to thank maſter William for his mickle courteſie, and to make tender of myſelfe to him.—Fadre quod he, I have a crotchett in my brayne, that will need your aide.

Conſented I to the ſame, and purſuant ſett outt he Mundaie following for the minſter of our Ladie and Saint Goodwyne, where a drawing of a ſteeple, contryvd for the belles when runge to ſwaie out of the ſyde the ayre, had I thence; it was done by Syr Symon de Mambrie, who, in the troubleſomme rayne of kyng Stephen, devoted himſelfe, and was ſhorne.</p>
                        <p>"Hawkes ſhowd me a manuſcript in Saxonne, but I was onley to bargayne for drawyings.—The next drawyngs I metten with was a church to be reard, ſo as in form of a croſs, the end ſtanding in the ground; a long manuſcript was annexd. Maſter Canning thought no workman culd be found handie enough to do it.—The tale of the drawers deſerveth relation.—Thomas de Blunderville, a preeſte, although the preeſte had no allows, lovd a fair mayden, and on her begatt a ſonn. Thomas educated his ſonn; at ſixteen years he went into

Thomas nevertheleſs had not ſeen his ſonn for five years, yet kennd him inſtauntly; and learning the name of the bryde, took him aſydde and diſclosd to him that he was his ſonn, and was weded to his own ſiſtre.

The prior of Coventree did ſell me a picture of great account, made by Badilian Y'allyanne, who did live in the reign of Kynge Henrie the Firſt, a mann of fickle temper, havyng been tendred ſyx pounds of ſilver for it, to which he ſaid naie, and afterwards did give it to the then abott of

                        <p>"Fadree, you have done mickle well, all the chatills are more worth then you gave; take this for your paynes: ſo ſaying, he did put into my hands a purſe of two hundreds good pounds, and did ſay that I ſhould note be in need; I did thank him moſt heartily.—The choiſe drawyng, when his fadre did dye, was begunn to be put up, and ſomme houſes neer the old church eraſed; it was drawn by Aſlema, preeſte of St. Cutchburts, and offerd as a drawyng for Weſtminſter, but caſt aſyde, being the tender did not ſpeak French.—I had now mickle of ryches, and lyvd in a houſe on the hyll, often repayrings to maſtere William, who was now lord of the houſe. I ſent him my verſes touching his church, for which he did ſend me mickle good things.—In the year kyng Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward came to Briſtow, maſter Cannings ſend for me to avoid a marriage which the kyng was bent upon between him and a ladie he neer had ſeen, of the ſamilee of the Winddevilles; the danger

were nigh, unleſs avoided by one remidee, an holie one, which was, to be ordained a ſonn of holy church, beyng franke from the power of kynges in that cauſe, and cannot be wedded.—Mr. Cannings inſtauntly ſent me to Carpenter, his good friend, biſhop of Worceſter, and the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following was prepaird and ordaynd the next day, the daie of St. Mathew, and on Sunday ſung his firſt maſs in the church of our Ladie, to the aſtoniſhing of kyng Edward, who was ſo ſuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly madd and ravyngs withall, that maſter Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings was wyling to give him 3000 markes, which made him peace again, and he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myted to the preſence of the kyng, ſtaid in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, partook of all his pleaſures and paſtimes till he departed the next year.</p>
                        <p>"I gave maſter Cannings my Briſtow tragedy, for which he gave me in hands twentie pounds, and did praiſe it more then I did think my ſelf did deſerve, for I can ſay in troth I was never proud of my verſes ſince I did read maſter Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; and now haveing nought to do, and not wyling to be ydle.

He gave me 20 markes, and I did goe to Aſhley, to maſter Pelham, to be payd of him for the other one I left with him.</p>

            <head>ANTIQUITY OF CHRISTMAS GAMES.</head>
            <p>IN the days of our anceſtors, Chriſtmas was a period ſacred to mirth and hoſpitality. Though not wholly neglected now, it cannot boaſt of the honours it once had; the veneration for religious ſeaſons fled with popery, and old Engliſh hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality is long ſince deceaſed. Our modern play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of fortune, who make the whole year a revolution of diſſipation and joyleſs feſtivity, cannot diſtinguiſh this ſeaſon; unleſs by reſting from their laborious pleaſures, and (if they can think) find a happy ſerenity in ſolitude and reflection, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in the tumult of hurricanes.—The ancient Chriſtmas gambols were, in my opinion, ſuperior to our modern ſpectacles and amuſements; wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, hurling the ball, and dancing in the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, were pleaſures for men; it is true, the converſation of the hearth-fide was the tales of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0536900400:160"/>
the fairies, Robin Goodfellow, and hobgoblins, never failed to make the trembling audience mutter an Ave Maria, and croſs their chins; but the laughable exerciſes of blindman's buff, riddling, and queſtion and command, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently compenſated for the ſew ſudden ſtarts of terror. Add to theſe amuſements, the wretched voices of the chanters and ſub chanters; howling carols in Latin; the chiming of conſecrated bells; the burning conſecrated wax candles; curiouſly repreſenting the Virgin Mary; praying the ſaint whoſe monaſtery ſtood neareſt; the munching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated croſs-loaves, ſold by the monks; all which effectually eradicated the ſpectres of their terrific ſtories. Nor were theſe the only charms againſt the foul fiends, and night-mare; ſleeping croſs-legged, like the effigies of Knights Templars, and warriors, and the holy buſh and church-yard yew, were certain antidotes againſt thoſe inviſible beings. After this repreſentation, I may be thought partial to my own hobby-horſe, as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary, in giving the preference to the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the days of old; but let the ſentimental reader conſider that the tales of ſuperſtition, when believed, affect the ſoul with a ſenſation plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0536900400:161"/>
horrid; we may paint in more lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours to the eye, they ſpoke to the heart.</p>
            <p>The great barons and knights uſually kept open houſe during this ſeaſon, when their villains, or vaſſals, were entertained with bread, beef, and beer, and a pudding, waſtol cake, or Chriſtmas kitchel, and a groat in ſilver at parting; being obliged, in return, to wave the full flaggon round their heads, in honour of the maſter of the houſe. Sometimes the feſtival continued, till Twelfth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, when the baron, or his ſteward, took the deis, or upper ſeat of the table, and after dinner gave every man a new gown of his livery, and two Chriſtmas kitchels.—This kind of liberality, endeared the barons to the common people, and made them ever ready to take up arms under their banners.</p>
            <p>A regiſter of the nunnery of Keynſham relates, that William, earl of Gloceſter, entertained two hundred knights with tilts and fortunys, at his great manor of Keynſham, provided thirty pies of the eels of Avon, as a curious dainty; and on the Twelfth-day began the plays for the knights
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0536900400:162"/>
by the monks; with miracles and maumeries for the henchmen and ſervants, by minſtrels.</p>
            <p>Here is plainly a diſtinction made between maumeries and miracles, and the more noble repreſentations comprehended under the name plays. The firſt were the holiday entertainments of the vulgar; the other of the barons and nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The private exhibitions at the manors of the barons, were uſually family hiſtories, the monk, who repreſented the maſter of the family, being arrayed in a tabard (or herald's coat without ſleeves) painted with all the hatchments of the names. In theſe domeſtic performances abſurdities were unavoidable; and in a play wrote by Sir Tib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet Gonges, Conſtance, counteſs of Bretagne and Richmond, marries and buries her three huſbands in the compaſs of an hour.

            <p>A Few months before the abdication of the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardly tyrant James II. lord chancellor Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fries, of deteſted memory, went to Arundel, in Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, in order to influence an election. He took his reſidence at the caſtle, and went the day fixed for the election to the town-hall, where Mr. Peckam, who was then mayor of Arundel, held his court. Jeffries had the impudence to ſhew his bloody face there: the mayor ordered him to withdraw immediately; and in caſe of refuſal, threatened to have him committed. <q rend="inline">"You,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"who ought to be the guardian of our laws, and of our ſacred conſtitution, ſhall not ſo audaciouſly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them.

            <p>BEING a little curious in antiquities, I have found that the Saxon heralds had theſe three tinctures, Heofnas, Weal, and Ocyre. Heofnas, (that is, in Saxon, Heaven) I take to be azure.

            <p>SCULPTURE is an art which, by deſign and ſolid matter, imitates the palpable objects of nature. It is difficult to aſcertain the epocha of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0536900400:174"/>
its origin; it is loſt in the moſt remote antiquity. The arts of imitation in general, as painting, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, ſculpture, &amp;c. where the firſt invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Sculptors began to work upon clay and wax, which are more flexible, and more pliable than wood and ſtone. They ſoon made ſtatues of trees which were neither ſubject to corruption nor worms, as the lemon-tree, the cypreſs, the palm, the olive, the ebony, and the vine: at laſt they made uſe of metals, ivory, and the hardeſt ſtones; marble eſpecially became the moſt precious matter, and the moſt eſteemed for works of ſculpture.</p>
            <p>The nations amongſt which this fine art was in the greateſt honour were the Aegyptians; thoſe people, ſo celebrated by the monuments of their gratitude towards the memory of the kings their benefactors. It was to perpetuate their names, that they erected, in the earlieſt ages, the two Coloſſean ſtatues of Mocrus, and the queen his ſpouſe.</p>
            <p>The Aegyptian ſculptors excelled all others in exactneſs of proportion; the different parts of a ſtatue were often formed by divers artiſts; and theſe parts united made the whole perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0536900400:175"/>
The Greek hiſtorians boaſt of the invention of that art in their country, which they attribute to love: however, it is certain that the firſt eſſays of ſculpture in Greece were very unpoliſhed; but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalus, having travelled into Aegypt, improved himſelf in this art, and formed afterwards pupils who became the admiration of a people whoſe taſte was not yet refined by the elegant ſtatues of Phydias, Myron, Lyſippus, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Greeks, ſubdued by the Romans, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated inſenſibly; and the arts vaniſhed with their freedom.</p>
            <p>Sculpture was an exotic which never could thrive in victorious Rome; its tranſient glory was eclipſed by the other arts in the reign of Auguſtus; it declined under Tiberius, Caius, and Claudius; and re-appeared with an enormous magnitude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Nero.</p>
            <p>The Gothic ſculpture ſprung afterwards from a wild imagination, unaſſiſted by nature.</p>
            <p>The epocha of ſculpture is the ſame in France and Italy. The celebrated Michael Angelo work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0536900400:176"/>
in Rome under the pontificate of Leo X. whilſt John Goujon was admitted at Paris, under the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of Francis I.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh advanced by ſlow degrees to the perfection of that art, in which they now rival their ancient maſters.</p>
            <p>The ſculptors gave the name of ſtatue to a figure in emboſſed work, that ſtands by itſelf in wood, ſtone, marble, or metal, of perſons conſpicuous by their birth, their rank, or their merit.</p>
            <p>The ancients often repreſented figures of men, kings, and even gods, under a ſpecies of ſtatues ſmaller than the natural ſize.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of perſons who had diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their ſuperior knowledge, their virtues, or ſome important ſervices to the commonwealth, were erected at the public expence in ſtatues of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſize.</p>
            <p>The third ſpecies of ſtatues was deſigned for kings and emperors: they were taller than men
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0536900400:177"/>
commonly are; and thoſe which perſonated he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes were larger in proportion.</p>
            <p>As for the Coloſſean ſtatues, they repreſented gods; and often kings and emperors, deſirous to magnify themſelves by theſe ſtupendous works, reared at their own expence monuments of their vanity and folly.</p>
            <p>An equeſtrian ſtatue exhibits a man on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; as the ſtatue of Charles I. at Charing-croſs; the ſtatue of Henry IV. at Paris; and that of Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo de Medicis, at Leghorn.</p>
            <p>A Greek ſtatue is naked and antique; thus called, becauſe the Greeks diſplayed in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the gods, the heroes, and the athlets of the Olympic games.</p>
            <p>The Roman ſtatues are all repreſented with a drapery.</p>
            <p>A mauſoleum is a pompous funeral monument, decorated with ſculpture and architecture, with an epitaph ſacred to the memory of ſome conſiderable perſonage. It derives its etymology from the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0536900400:178"/>
magnificent tomb, which Queen Artemiſa cauſed to be erected for Mauſolus, king of Caria, her huſband.</p>
            <p>Heroes, patriots, and ſtateſmen, are not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the love and veneration of their cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries during their lives, but their virtues and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices ought to be tranſmitted to the lateſt poſterity. This vanity of ſurviving our duſt by laſting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of national gratitude, has prompted men to the moſt noble actions, and inſpired them with the emulation of being enrolled in the records of time, with thoſe great heroes whoſe ſtatues and inſcriptions they contemplate with a ſort of extacy. The tombs of Weſtminſter-abbey fill the mind with that awful reverence, which a magnificent and grateful nation teſtifies for its benefactors. The portraits of the illuſtrious warriors who have ſubdued our inveterate enemies in both hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphered, expoſed to public view in Vauxhall-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, create even in a diſſipated multitude a kind of admiration greatly ſuperior to that inſpired by the enchantment of the place. The ſpirit and magnamanity of the incorruptible Beckford, ſo becoming the firſt magiſtrate of the metropolis of a powerful empire; his noble and animated ſpeech
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0536900400:179"/>
to the throne, which was the laſt public teſtimony of his unwearied zeal for his country's cauſe, will be echoed with applauſe at the ſight of his ſtatue by the ſucceeding generation, to whom he tried to tranſmit our conſtitution reſtored to its priſtine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

               <q rend="inline">"And that I defy him to do. Here, Harry, take the trifles. Yours, Mr. Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle."</q> And away drove the titular honourables, whom I heard no more of till my exaltation among the quality. The next diſcourſe of any conſequence happened between Mr. Spangle and his ſon. Jack Spangle was as complete a city buck as any who ſrequent the Park when the ſun ſhines. He ſpoke an angliciſed French very ſlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; and murdered an overture upon the violin to admiration. <q rend="inline">"Jack (ſaid the old gentleman to him one day, when the ungracious ſpendthrift had made application for t'other bank bill) theſe wild courſes will never do. I hear you have a miſtreſs; I don't begrudge it, Jack; but why will
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0536900400:182"/>
you pay ſo confounded dear for her? I make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances; you are fleſh and blood as well as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; would you had as much prudence as many years have taught me. I proteſt, when I was a young fellow, I cut as pretty a figure as you with half the expence. I uſed to take a trip into the country, hire a good handſome wench as my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, put her into reputable lodgings, and buy every thing neceſſary for her myſelf; and by theſe means fix her my own at an eaſy rate. Here was the ſurgeon's bill ſaved, and my conſtitution kept whole and ſound for matrimony, if ever fate ſhould throw a wife, with ten thouſand pounds, in my way. I made every lady a compliment, but ſeldom accompanied it with any other preſent than a kiſs. Would you, Jack, purſue the ſame prudent method, you would find the benefit of it; but I am afraid you are reſolved to buy experience dear."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Jack heard this admonition with a ſheepiſhneſs natural enough to the choice ſpirits of the city, when they are under the rod of correction: but the old gentleman producing a bill at the end of his harangue, Jack's countenance brightened up; he received it, and bowing reſpectfully, ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0536900400:183"/>
out, <q rend="inline">"'Tis very true, Sir, as you ſay, Sir."</q>
            </p>
            <p>After lying in the ſhop three months and four days, (I always endeavour to be preciſe in my chronology, as it gives the reader aſſurance, that the hiſtory is really and <hi>bona fide,</hi> true) one of my rays by an accident, began to be a little tarniſhed: this was a terrible misfortune, as in conſequence of it, I was degraded to the glaſs-caſe at the door. I now gave way to the moſt violent emotionsof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and thought my ſplendor irretrievable; ſaw all my hopes of riſing in the polite world vaniſhed; and expected never to be relieved, till the day of tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, from my diſgraceful ſituation. But fate had kinder days in ſtore for me. The firſt object that claimed my attention in the ſtreet, was the ſuperb chair of Mrs. Spermacety, the wax-chandler's wife. Her chairmen were loaded with ſilver lace; and the footman who cleared the way, had an enormous bag wig. I expected to have ſeen it filled with the dignity of a ducheſs; but how great was my aſtoniſhment, when I perceived a ſhort, fat woman, of the ſame complexion as the ſign of the Saracen's Head faſtened in it! She was dreſſed meanly rich, without the ſhadow of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0536900400:184"/>
in any thing but her chair, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly belonged to a lady of quality, having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it at her deceaſe. Her ſneaking pitiful countenance did not diſcover one grain of genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity or nobility: ſhe appeared an abſolute burleſque on the grandeur which ſurrounded her. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing dialogue between Mr. Spangle and his good friend and neighbour Mr. Pickle let me into her whole hiſtory. <q rend="inline">"Good morning to you, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Spangle, as the man ſaid; methinks Mrs. Spermaceti ſhines to-day."</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"She ſhines every day, at home and abroad, Mr. Pickle: but there may be reaſons for it; and the grey mare is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the better horſe."</q> This ſtroke, though in my opinion not very brilliant, brought a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laugh on both ſides for about ten minutes. <q rend="inline">"You are a wit, neighbour, you are a wit; but they ſay, as how, that Mrs. Spermaceti was formerly her huſband's cook-maid; but lies and ſnow-balls gather in rolling; pray is there any truth in the matter?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Between ourſelves, there is a great deal of truth in it; and the firſt charm that Mr. Spermaceti found in his ſpouſe, was that ſhe dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ortolans to a miracle."</q> Another loud laugh of applauſe echoed to the end of the ſtreet. <q rend="inline">"And they ſay, Mr. Spangle, as how, that ſhe loſt three
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0536900400:185"/>
thouſand pounds one night at the gaming table to lord what-ye-callum—lord Dillitanti; is that true?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Very true, upon my word; for Tom Shamwell, who now lives by his wit, ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her chair, to let him into her hand, as they call it."</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Well, the Lord help us all, it is a ſad thing to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e a ſpending wife, who conſumes all the money before we gets it."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This edifying diſcourſe was terminated by a hearty ſhake of the hand, and an invitation from both parties to partake of a bottle of wine. I had now remained expoſed to public view for about three weeks, and had caught the eye of every ſtaring countryman, who did honour to my fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len brightneſs, by exclaiming, <q rend="inline">"Odzounds! what a woundy pretty thingamy!"</q> Fortune at laſt began to ſmile, and my deliverance from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace was effected in the following manner.</p>
            <p>Father L'Andridella was at the time of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended aſſaſſination of the king of Portugal treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to a principal college of the order of Jeſus, in the city of Liſbon. He was the intimate friend and conſidant of Malagrida; and aſſiſted him in compoſing thoſe ridiculous whimſies which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0536900400:186"/>
condemned as heretical. He was alſo deep in the important ſecret; and when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy began to unravel, was happy enough to eſcape the flames which Malagrida and the other conſpirators periſhed in. The inhumanity with which the innocent families of the only two noble conſpirators were treated, is too ſhocking to be dwelt upon.</p>
            <p>Andridella went firſt to Paris, where he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by St. Florentin to bear certain preſents to certain miniſters in England, on a pacific account: but he demanding more for his trouble than St. Florentin choſe to give, he was threatened with being confined for life in the Baſtile; which threat would have been actually carried into execution, had he not timely got away to England.</p>
            <p>How a certain phyſician came by his intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſhall be known in due time.</p>
            <p>Andridella, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, ſhifted his habit, and equipped himſelf as a pedlar. Being a man of an extenſive genius, and great knowledge in chemiſtry, he prepared ſeveral tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for taking ſpots out of linen, recovering
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0536900400:187"/>
tarniſhed gold or ſilver, and other ingenious <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutiae.</hi> In one of his diurnal rotations, he called on Mr. Spangle, and imparted to him the virtues of his box. I was accordingly taken down to bear witneſs to the excellence of his tincture; and on the touch of his bruſh moiſtened by it ſhone forth with redoubled luſtre, which, by a natural ſympathy glittered alſo in the eyes of Mr. Spangle. Andridella was paid generouſly, and I was once more carefully laid up in the ſhop; but my ſtay there was very ſhort; for Mr. Buckram, the tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, gave me the preference before twenty of my brethren, and fixed me to a magnificent ſuit of cloaths, which were conveyed to B—n houſe, for the uſe of a young d—, juſt ſtepped into his eſtate and title.</p>
            <p>The duke of D—e was the nobleman upon whoſe breaſt I commanded reſpect. Paracelſus, and that ingenious aſtrologic phyſician, Culpeper, aſſert, that gold and ſilver have a magic virtue. The magic of this virtue, commercially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is intereſt; phyſically, it is chimerical; and metaphiſically, it is a fine ſubtle genius or ſpirit, as capable of reaſoning upon matter, as any deiſt ſince Bolingbroke. By the magic of my compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0536900400:188"/>
I was enabled to look internally into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms which I adorned externally, and had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be diſſatisfied with my ſituation, as his grace's heart was no diſhonour to his ſtar. He was young, and had his foibles; the principal of which was a ſtrong paſſion for gaming. Reaſon in vain endeavoured to convince him of his error; had he been convinced, his reſolution would have been too feeble to bear him through in a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt time I adorned him, I viſited the court; after the levee was over, he was accoſted by Lord Rattle, <q rend="inline">"Ah, D—e, how the devil d'ye do to day? I was horridly dipp'd laſt night; thirteen bottles of champaigne, demme. Lord Shuffle was bit this morning of three thouſand; and has ſent to his ſteward to cut down a whole foreſt to have a better ſtock to proceed upon. Pray, have you ſeen C—d's Letters?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"O hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid! don't mention the ſtuff; I ſicken at the idea. Lady Bab Blouzy has had the vapours theſe five days by peruſing as many lines. Nauſeous, 'pon 'onour: I always write my billets in French; a certain preſervative againſt vulgar criticiſm!"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Gadſo, you're right, my lord: but as I always thought writing pedantic and beneath a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, my valet always writes my amorous epiſtles:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0536900400:189"/>
and a fine fellow he is too! Trims a ſentiment like a bag-wig, and twiſts a meaning like a curl."</q> I admired his lordſhips prudence, in making his valet a ſecretary, as it was more than probable he was better qualified for the office than his honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able maſter.</p>
            <p>In the evening, I accompanied the duke to the gaming-table; my luſtre ſickened, and my whole frame trembled, at beholding the knot of raſcals and villains, who ſurrounded him. Some he honoured with a nod; and others he condeſcended to enter into a converſation with; and then with an air of careleſs indifference, ſat down to play, and before he roſe, loſt above eight thouſand pounds. This loſs but very little affected him, and he went home with the ſame compoſure of mind he brought out with him. The ſharpers who ſhared the booty, were Sir Richard —, lord M—, Jack Hounſlow, and father Andredilla, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity had raiſed me to my preſent exalted ſtation. Sir Richard had a legal claim to his title, but no man could diſgrace it with more villanies or mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. His humble ſoul ſtooped to every thing when intereſt was in the way, and his tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience never gave him any trouble about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0536900400:190"/>
Though lord M—, and this conſcientious knight of the poſt, were continually quarrelling every were elſe, they always agreed at the gaming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, in a very capital point, viz. to bubble his grace. His grace was ſo eaſy, ſo ſuperficially learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the art of gambling, and his antagoniſts ſo cunning and deep in the myſtery, that B—n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe was more than once on the verge of being ſold, to pay theſe inpoſtors what the world calls debts of honour. Lord M—, who though young, yet enervated with pleaſure, had ſtill a hankering deſire to be ſacrificing on the altar of the Cytherean goddeſs; and, by the infallibility of a bank-bill, had gained admittance into the chamber of Miſs R—rs, the baronet's miſtreſs. His lordſhip was making his addreſſes, when Sir Richard made his appearance: as the baronet was a man of prudence, and knew how to make uſe of an opportunity, he propoſed to his lordſhip, that if he ſhould be permitted to partake of the profits ariſing from his grace, and an eminent Eaſt-India bubble, his lordſhip ſhould partake in common with the baronet in the charms of Miſs R—rs. Lord M— ſtretched his gallantry to the utmoſt, and complied: and it was upon this conſideration that the baronet had admittance to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0536900400:191"/>
the gaming table. Jack Hounſlow was his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's underſtrapper; he had been an upholſterer, but having ſquandered his ſtock, and nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left but a pair of piſtols, he employed them to the moſt profitable advantage, by levying contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions on the highway. The frequent executions of his fellow labourers ſtriking a damp upon his ſpirits, and having now pretty well recruited his pockets, he gave up his hazardous employment and commenced ſharper. Lord M— ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his inventive genius and uſeful parts, and engaged him in his ſervice.</p>
            <p>Sir Kenelm Digby, who ſo religiouſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the doctrine of ſympathy, would have attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted his lordſhip's diſcovery to ſimilar feelings in his own breaſt. But as many tedious and learned arguments may be brought to maintain it, and to ſay but little in a caſe of importance, is worſe than nothing at all, and for other good cauſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, I ſhall leave it entirely to the reader.</p>
            <p>Father Andredilla having acquired a conſiderable ſum by his tinctures, put himſelf into a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent dreſs, hired three ſervants, and aſſuming the title of marquis de Villa Garcia, completed the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0536900400:192"/>
party who were continually preying upon the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the duke. One morning, lord Rattle came thundering in upon his grace, <q rend="inline">"O, D—e, I ſhall die with riſibility. Never was ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical figure, demme; no maſquerade face can be half ſo laughable. There's C—d gone to his trial, with a countenance as dejected as lord B—e's when at Kingſton; and lady Harriet G—r, with a face as bronzed and as impudent as a naiad of Covent-Garden."</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Pretty work, Rattle, and what d'ye think will be the iſſue?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Between you and I, I have a very important ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and could I confide in your retentive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by the Lord, I have no friend upon earth I would rather reveal it to."</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"You may depend upon my honour, Jack; did I ever betray your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable ſecrets?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Why then, D—e, it is abſolutely determined, that when a divorce is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, C—d ſhall poſitively marry lady Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet: I may confide in your honour now, I hope?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Undoubtedly,"</q> replied his grace, ſmothering a laugh, <q rend="inline">"your ſecrets are of too much importance to be triſled with."</q> Lord Rattle's whiſpers had generally as much truth, as thoſe of a coffee-houſe politician, who is happy in the acquaintance of a paragraph-maker.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0536900400:193"/>
I had lived with his grace long enough to ſee him bubbled out of thirty thouſand pounds, and was then configned, as a cuſtomary fee, to his valet, who immediately carried me to Monmouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, to take my chance with an army of decayed gentry; ſome of whom I had been acquainted with in their days of proſperity. As I had lived my uſual time among the great, I ſubmitted to my fate without murmuring. A black velvet coat and waiſtcoat, my near neighbours, were taken down to give phyſical dignity to a young fellow who had newly commenced quack-doctor; and found out a noſtrum to cure diſtempers which never exiſted. This ſuit had once adorned a genius of the ſame profeſſion, whoſe extraordinary operations in Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields, had made him the envy of all Hatton-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Doctor Bialini, the original wearer, was quite an Eſculapius in his way; he was unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with every principle in ſurgery: but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much courage and impudence, as ignorance, he boldly undertook the moſt difficult operations. When he happened to divide an artery in the cure of a ſcratch, it was all very well; and he had diſcovered by experience, that diverting the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper to the nobler parts, was an infalliable cure, for inconſiderable ailments. He couched for the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0536900400:194"/>
cataract, and where he cured one by chance, he made twenty totally blind, beyond all poſſibility of recovery. But ſucceſs did not always attend his adventure; a young lady of great family ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to him to be eaſed of a troubleſome pain in the head, he gave her ſuch a doſe of his cathartic pills, that ſhe expired under their operation. The friends of the deceaſed accuſed the doctor of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and left it to his choice either to take a doſe of his own cathartics, or leave England to return no more. As he knew the merit of his medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments too well to chuſe the firſt, he returned to Italy, to exerciſe his honeſter occupation of a tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor. His ſolemn habiliments were now diſpoſed of to his ſucceſſor in fame, Mr. Perron, who had been educated a cobler, and on the merit of being twice ſalivated, advertiſed to cure a certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper in all its extenſive branches. The regular ſurgeons have had no reaſon to complain of his ſucceſs; as he has greatly increaſed the buſineſs of the faculty, by confirming the diſeaſe, and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſtitution in every patient he undertook to cure. The warehouſe I was laid up in was greatly frequented by ſecond-hand gentry, among whom I heard many entertaining diſcourſes, but too foreign from my purpoſe to be related here.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0536900400:195"/>
A ſervant enquiring for a rich ſuit with a ſtar, I was accordingly taken down, approved of, and carried off. I wondered what uſe I was going to be put to, when a meagre tall old man made his appearance. <q rend="inline">"Well done, my bra' bonny lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, this is ſaving the ſiller, and laying up more for the bairn."</q> Theſe words were uttered by the identical duke of A—, who putting on his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent finery, ſtepped into a coach, as antiquated as hoſpitality, and rattled off to court. The recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he met with from his M—, would have ſhamed virtue out of countenance: when we ſee villany and avarice careſſed, what ſhall we ſay, but that k—s are men. His only merit was in being born a Scot, and diſtantly related to lord B—. I had examined his breaſt, and found him nothing but a compoſition of pride, fraud and avarice. As he was deep in all his favoured countryman's ſecrets, the affair of the peace was not unknown to him, and he had no inconſiderable ſhare of the booty. Not contented with his ſhare, he revealed the tranſaction to a certain weſtern phyſician, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by oath, not to diſcover from whom he had his intelligence; and articling to receive a moiety of whatever ſhould be given the doctor to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0536900400:196"/>
ſtop his mouth, or ſay nothing at all to the purpoſe. The whole juggle was tranſacted entirely to the duke's ſatisfaction: and he partook ſo gloriouſly of the huſh-money, that for a moment emerging from his uſual avarice; he gave his ſervants new liveries, and matched one of his horſes, having before paired a bay and a black one. The nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity did not receive him ſo well as his M—; as he was univerſally looked upon as a ſcandal to his title, he was ſhunned by every polite company. Unfortunately, the too retentive memory of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, diſcovered his grace's cloaths to have been worn by a more honourable nobleman; and having whiſpered his diſcovery to lady Henrietta F—h. as a very great ſecret; it was known all over the town before the evening, that the duke of A— had been to court in the duke of D—'s caſt-off cloaths. Nothing can expreſs the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the old duke; his pride, which had ſtooped to his avarice, in the purchaſe of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent bargain, began, though too late, to have the pre-eminence; he ordered his ſervant to bear me back to Monmouth-ſtreet, and deſire the frippery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to refund the money, which he did, after deducting a guinea for the uſe of his magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS there are few monthly productions ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally read as your agreeable Miſcellany, I have taken the liberty to beg the inſertion of the following ſhort account of my life, in which I ſhall be as brief as poſſible; and which, if you think proper to countenance, may be a means to warn others of my ſex from falling into the ſame unhappy ſnares, which I now fatally experience have been my ruin.</p>
            <p>My parents were people of ſome repute, for my father enjoyed a place under the government of upwards of two hundred pounds a year, beſides a ſmall eſtate in the country, which brought him in about a hundred and fifty pounds a year more. As I was their only daughter, they naturally took the beſt care of my learning that their income would permit, and I was ſent early to a boarding ſchool, where I received the rudiments of a polite
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0536900400:199"/>
education, and made as great progreſs in French, muſic, &amp;c. as could reaſonably be expected.</p>
            <p>I was in my thirteenth year when my father died of a fever, and as he had been no great oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomiſt, and the eſtate which he enjoyed was to leave our family at his death, my poor mother and I were left without the leaſt reſource. Grief for the loſs of a tender and affectionate huſband, ſoon put an end to my mother's diſtreſs; and I was now the only one left to ſuffer for the faults of my poor father's imprudence. It happened I had a near relation who was married to a gentleman of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who pitying my ſituation, took me home with her to be a companion. By the chearfulneſs of my diſpoſition, and my univerſal aſſiduities to pleaſe, I ingratiated myſelf ſo much in the favour of my couſin and Mr. M—, and received for it ſuch convincing proofs of their friendſhip and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make me happy, that I ſoon forgot the loſs I had ſo lately ſuſtained. Mr. and Mrs. M— were extremely good-natured and affable, and I enjoyed every felicity I could wiſh for in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ſtate. Unluckily for me, Mrs. M— was threatened with a conſumption, juſt as I had attained my fifteenth year, which daily increaſing,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0536900400:200"/>
in about ſix months, terminated a life, the loſs of which I have now the utmoſt reaſon to lament; but not before ſhe had recommended me to the care of Mr. M— in ſuch terms that none but a wretch abandoned to all manner of villainy could have ever forgot.</p>
            <p>I felt every emotion of grief which a heart truly ſuſceptible of gratitude could experience at ſuch a ſhock; but my concern was ſoon alleviated by the aſſurances I received from my ſurviving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor of a continuance of that protection and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem I had hitherto met with. By his genoroſity I was rendered ſole miſtreſs of his houſe, and had every indulgence granted which I could expect. As he had no children, he took me frequently with him, for an airing in the chariot, and though I obſerved his fondneſs for me, daily increaſe, I did not ſuffer the leaſt ſuſpicion to enter my breaſt. Being of an age in which young women are initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in company, and as I was to move in a more genteel ſphere, than formerly, I was no longer to be ſupported in my preſent character, but at a conſiderable expence, ſo that he ſpared no coſt to make me appear ſuitable to that rank in which he placed me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0536900400:201"/>
By this ſtratagem, which I did not at firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, he filled me with additional tenderneſs and gratitude; compelled me to repoſe on him as my only ſupport; and by my ſenſe of his favour, and the deſire of retaining it, diſpoſed me to unlimited complaiſances. At laſt the wretch took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the familiarity which he enjoyed as my relation, and the ſubmiſſion which he exacted as my benefactor, to attempt the ruin of an orphan, whom his indulgence had melted, and his authority had ſubdued. Shocked at the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his deſigns, I ſummoned all the courage which a weak woman could employ, and reſented his behaviour with a becoming indignation. But inſtead of recoiling at the deed, he upbraided me with ingratitude, and mingled his artifices with menaces of total deſertion, if I ſhould continue to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>I was now completely depreſſed, and though I had ſeen mankind enough to know the neceſſity of outward chearfulneſs, I often withdrew to my chamber to vent my grief, and examine by what means I might eſcape perpetual mortification. The loſs of my indulgent parents and kind couſin were
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0536900400:202"/>
now ſeverely felt; and I only reflected that had I been taught a more uſeful kind of learning than a boarding-ſchool produces, I might ſtill live ſecure under the conſciouſneſs of an unblemiſhed reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Unaccuſtomed and unexperienced to earn my bread in a menial capacity, I had no hopes leſt but ſuch as might proceed from his future honour and genoroſity. I ſoon found myſelf cruelly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; no art or cunning was left untried to accompliſh his purpoſe; the moſt ſubtle proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of protection and maintenance were made uſe of, and a ſolemn promiſe of marriage to ſilence all my fears.</p>
            <p>Oh! Woman, woman, thy name is frailty!</p>
            <p>Young and credulous, I ſwallowed the glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bait, and fell an eaſy victim to the unruly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an ungrateful wretch.</p>
            <p>But, alas! When he found the conſequences attendant on our crime, which I tremble to relate, he not only refuſed to fulfil his promiſe of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but alſo abandoned me to all the pangs of recollection, and the frowns of a mercileſs world.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0536900400:203"/>
Yet villain as he was, he did not turn me out of doors, till he had given me money to ſupport me in thoſe moments of perturbation, which his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had forced me to ſuffer; and an untimely birth at length relieved me from the anxieties of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though it left me under the ſevere preſſures of infamy, and the painful proſpect of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poverty.</p>
            <p>Friends and acquaintances have now forſaken me, and I am reduced to the lot of thoſe unhappy beings, from whom many, who melt at the ſight of all other miſery, think it meritorious to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold relief; whom the rigour of virtuous indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation dooms to ſuffer without complaint, and periſh without regard; and whom I myſelf have formerly inſulted in the pride of reputation, and ſecurity of innocence.</p>
            <p>Let others, who read my ſtory, be warned by my example; and however ſpecious the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, avoid the conſequences. Let them conſider that however ſecure they may think themſelves, they will have need of all their fortitude when put to the teſt. Whatever they may think of me,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0536900400:204"/>
let them judge as favourably as poſſible, and as it is out of their power to aſſiſt, let them at leaſt pity a wretch deſtined to ſuffer for the faults of an ungrateful monſter.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>PERMIT me, through the channel of your Magazine, to lay before the public, ſcenes of diſtreſs of no common kind. Though it can afford me no pleaſure to recite the many ſufferings of a wretched victim to misfortune; yet, by my errors, others may be convinced that the way of virtue only, is the way to felicity. Born to an elevated rank in life, I was inſtructed rather to value my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the blind acquiſitions of fortune, and the tinſel of external accompliſhments, than on the more ſolid and commendable qualifications of the mind. My years of infancy were marked by an infant pride; and the mercenary diſpoſition of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſervants did not fail to make the evil increaſe with my growth.</p>
            <p>When I juſt entered my ſixteenth year, I was initated into all the oeconomy of high life. Should the ruſtic or mercantile reader find fault with the expreſſion <hi>oeconomy,</hi> when applicable to high life,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0536900400:206"/>
his ignorance is ſeen in the cenſure. Dames of ſpirit have their mean ſavings; and a titled lady is as anxiouſly avaricious in her way, as any plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding citizen whoſe buſineſs and pleaſure unite in gain. Moſt of the eſtates of our nobility are heavily mortgaged, or lie uſeleſs to the owner, till the rent clears the incumbrances; this is all that can be urged in defence of a lady of quality's ſharping upon her ſervant, and ſlripping her fille de chambre of all her ready caſh, to anſwer ſome urgent demand upon her honour; which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, by that ſacred honour, ſhall be returned with intereſt in a few days. But, alas! Among quality, things equally as ſacred as honour are abuſed and trifled with. If there is any real ſpirit in high life, any generous indifference as to the affairs of this world, which ſhould conſtitute the ſole merit of <hi>nobleſſe,</hi> it is oftener found in a citizen's wife. However the court may exclaim againſt the city, there is leſs mercenary meanneſs in the dames of Ludgate-Hill, than in a whole maſquerade of right honourable diſhonourables</p>
            <p>But to return to my own ſtory. Happy in the notion of the world, by being born to a title and a large fortune, it is not to be doubted that the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0536900400:207"/>
coxcombs of the court were buſy to ingratiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in my favour, by genteely letting me know, they thought themſelves very pretty fellows; ſome indeed went ſo far, as to aſſure me by the <hi>lard,</hi> and all that, that I was conſumedly handſome, ſtill keeping a diſtant view to the dear ſubject, ſelf; and never lending a compliment, unleſs it might be returned to the maker. Theſe ſhadows of men were my continual torment, being my ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, perhaps, prejudiced averſion.</p>
            <p>Another claſs of lovers deſerved rather my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or my pity, than my love, theſe were men of ſenſe, who, by the malice of their fortune, (or their ſtars, if you are an aſtrologer) had never riſen in life to what their ambitious ideas aſpired to.</p>
            <p>As the cuſtoms of the world are, by the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy of it, allowed to be juſt, theſe men imagined every girl of conſpicuous accompliſhments, whoſe unexperienced heart they could deceive into love, their lawful prize. Dangerous is that lover who has more ſenſe than virtue: his ſenſe, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, is the greateſt evil he can poſſeſs. Fools are mere cyphers, they are like the air; when the arrow flies, no traces remain to tell its way; they
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0536900400:208"/>
are like the ſea, where every ſingle impreſſion is loſt in multitudes of impreſſions. Though I eaſily defended myſelf againſt the egotiſms and addreſſes of the coxcomb, I found it no eaſy taſk to ward off the aſſaults of the man of ſenſe; his batteries are levelled at the heart, and where he has mutual youth to plead in his favour, ſeldom fails of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the day. In the early bloom of life, we are not ourſelves; and I confeſs, had not pride been a more certain guard than virtue, my fortune would have fallen into the hands of the creditors of an unfortunate, but amorous author. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this was an error of youth; and the paſſion fled with my experience and the abſence of the bard. But, my God! Why did it fly! To make room for one which ſhould torment me for years. Better had it been for me to live poor by the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany of another, than to be rich, great, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by my own villany. But juſt heavens! I deſerve it all.</p>
            <p>I was in my nineteenth year, when the perſonal accompliſhments of a young gentleman, of inferior rank and fortune to mine, a Mr. Knowles, firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged my notice. I cannot ſay, I conceived a paſſion inſtantaneouſly for him; I was never ſo
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0536900400:209"/>
romantic. I admired his manly figure, his eaſy air, and affable behaviour. In ſhort, I wiſhed to know him, which was going as far as a woman of prudence, could go upon firſt ſight. I was then univerſally allowed to be a beauty; and was unhappy enough to engage his attention. If his perſon pleaſed, his converſation charmed me; I was now madly in love. A ſolid judgment, without the leaſt cynical caſt; a florid, eaſy manner of ſpeech, without the leaſt affectation; and a fluent tongue, without any impertinence, all inſpired to make me ſo. From the minute of our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, we began an acquaintance, an ill-fated one for me. Mr. Knowles had never ſpoke of his paſſion, though his fine eyes expreſſed unutterable things: we were often together, and I did not think it an unhappy circumſtance that no declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been made; for that chilling coldneſs, which, by the cuſtom of the world, neceſſarily ſucceeds a declaration, till the matrimonial act is determined, muſt, to mutual lovers, be a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious torment. In the enſuing ſpring, Mr. Knowles being in the country, as I was one morning playing on my harpſichord, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came haſtily into the room. <q rend="inline">"My dear girl,"</q> ſaid he, throwing his arm round my waiſt,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0536900400:210"/>
               <q rend="inline">"I am overjoyed; partake of my tranſports, and eaſe one part of them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I replied, <q rend="inline">"Whatever gives my father joy, muſt conſequently be welcome to me."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It is in your power,"</q> anſwered he, <q rend="inline">"in your power alone, to inſure this happineſs to me. The earl of — has ſeen you; he likes, he loves you: he has this day offered propoſals to me, and will ſettle more than your own fortune on you."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I was thunder-ſtruck at this intelligence; I could hear no more: I fainted. My father was frighted; he called for help, and ſoon recovered me. Seeing me revive, he changed his tender ſolicitude to rage; called me an ungrateful, vile, diſobedient wretch, in having engaged my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to another, which he was ſure was the caſe, without his conſent; told me, I ſhould marry his lordſhip in three days time, or turn out of his doors with nothing but what I could demand. Saying this, he flung out of the room, and left me to conſult with Janet, my waiting woman, who was privy to my prepoſſeſſion in favour of Mr.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0536900400:211"/>
Knowles. <q rend="inline">"Oh, Janet!"</q> I exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"was ever poor creature ſo ſuddenly plunged into the depth of miſery!"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Why, to be ſure, madam,"</q> returned ſhe, <q rend="inline">"the matter is a little ſudden; but as to miſery, I have heard your honourable father ſay, that happineſs and miſery were both in our own hands. Suppoſe, madam, this affair had not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, would you ever have had Mr. Knowles?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"No!"</q> replied I warmly, <q rend="inline">"No! I would never have ſtooped below my birth."</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Why then, dear madam, if he is out of the queſtion, who could you have better than an earl? It is true, he is old, but then you will have a man of quality, and have all your own fortune ſettled on you. For my part, I can ſee no reaſon to heſitate."</q> Weak as theſe reaſons may appear, it was ſuch cogency of argument that urged me to conſent to be counteſs of —. Doubting the ſtability of the reſolution, I haſtened to put it into execution; and in one fatal minute did what ages of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance could not undo. My lord was affable and kind; my father tranſported out of himſelf; and I was neither miſerable nor happy, in a kind of negative exiſtence, which, for want of a better name, we call the vapours, a latitudinary word, which, meaning every thing, means nothing.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0536900400:212"/>
Mr. Knowles heard of our marriage: he flew on the wings of love. As I was ſitting alone in my parlour, amuſing myſelf with fruitleſs repentance, he burſt in upon me, and giving me an inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible look, exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Oh, my Fanny!"</q> That ſhort ſentence, did more, than the bittereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach could have done: it threw me into agonies not to be deſcribed. At laſt I gathered ſtrength enough to ſpeak. <q rend="inline">"Sir, ſince the laws of the world have have bound me to another, to whom my kind regards are due, they cannot now be yours."</q> This I murmured in articulations ſcarce to be underſtood: I knew not what I ſaid. He ſtarted from his chair, and eagerly ſeizing my hand, exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"And was there ever a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they could be mine!"</q> This reply embarraſſed me greatly; I was all confuſion and hurry, when my lord entered.</p>
            <p>Nothing can paint the diſtraction of his features; lunacy itſelf could not be more enraged; he fiercely commanded Mr. Knowles to walk out of the houſe, without permitting him to ſpeak, and returned to me with the countenance of a fury. <q rend="inline">"Madam,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"could you carry on your vile intrigues no where but in my houſe! But I
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0536900400:213"/>
will take care for the future, you ſhall have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues elſewhere."</q> Saying this, he left me, and never afterwards ſuffered me to ſtir out, but with an old woman, who ſerved me in the office of a duenna.</p>
            <p>Vexed at this barbarous treatment, I reſented it like a woman of quality and ſpirit. I inſiſted on the diſmiſſion of my ſpy, and being left to my own liberty. This his lordſhip flatly refuſed. Madening with rage, I made an immediate aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with Mr. Knowles, exerted my authority, ſent back my guard, and flew in my own coach to the place of appointment.</p>
            <p>When a woman has taken one falſe ſtep, 'tis too late to think of receding; ſhe is neceſſitated to go on. Jealouſy is certainly the effect of love; yet it is a very troubleſome effect, and only tends to make the poſſeſſor hated by the object he loves.</p>
            <p>My huſband's behaviour grew intolerable, and I was determined to leave him. This I did ſoon after with Mr. Knowles, and we retired to a neighbouring kingdom. Happy in not being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, we thought his lordſhip ſat eaſy under his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0536900400:214"/>
loſs; when the firſt intelligence we had of him brought his will. Diſtracted at the fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of my reſentment, I flew to the houſe once his, now mine, his generoſity having left me all, laying the blame on the diſparity of our ages, my prepoſſeſſion, and his jealouſy. Here had I the unhappineſs to find my father dying, ſtabbed to the heart with the news of my flight. O, my God! what an everlaſting hell of reflection muſt attend the guilty.</p>

            <p>THE man who ſits down to write his own hiſtory, has no very agreeable taſk to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute. The chevalier Taylor is the only egotiſt ſince Julius Caeſar, who has made tolerable work in drawing the picture of himſelf. Julius had but two colours to paint with, truth and claſſic ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance: here the chevalier had the advantage, for he was too great to be confined within the bounds of the firſt qualification, and has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0536900400:216"/>
But to proceed to my own affairs. I am, Mr. Editor, a Sad Dog, a very Sad Dog; have run through many ſad adventures, had many ſad eſcapes from the clutches of baliffs, and at the time of writing this ſad relation, am throned in a broken chair within an inch of a thunder-cloud.</p>
            <p>I ſet out in life with a fortune of five thouſand pounds, which the old prig, my father, left me, with this memorable piece of advice: <q rend="inline">"Item, I leave to my youngeſt ſon Henry, five thouſand pounds, with an old book, formerly his grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bridget's, called, The Way to ſave Wealth, containing a thouſand choice receipts in cookery, &amp;c. and I adviſe that he read two pages of the ſaid book every day before he dines."</q> Very pretty advice! but I had not veneration enough for the parental character to follow it.</p>
            <p>When the legacy was paid me, I bid my brother adieu, drank three bottles of claret with Sir Sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Ranger, who had married my ſiſter, and drove furiouſly to the metropolis in my own phaeton and ſour. Honour was the only book which I ever honoured with a peruſal; and being pretty well dipped in the theory of gambling, I ventured to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0536900400:217"/>
engage with ſome knights of the poſt, which were a little better verſed in the practical part, and at one ſitting loſt one fifth of my fortune. This was a terrible ſtroke to me, and I began, for the firſt time in my life, to reflect; but a bottle of champaigne, and a night at the hotel, drove every troubleſome idea out of my head.</p>
            <p>Miſs Fanny H—t, who by a natural tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is tranſmigrated from a whore into a bagnio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, was then in the bloom of her charms; ſhe was never a firſt-rate beauty, but always a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry favourite toaſt among the bucks and pretty fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the city.</p>
            <p>I was one evening ſtrolling the Park, when Miſs Fanny had experience enough to perceive that ſhe had nailed my attention. As I was neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her character, or ſituation, I was not a little elated with the condeſcending glances ſhe honoured me with. Preſuming on my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, I made her a few compliments, 'ſquired her out of the Park, and thought myſelf bleſt in being permitted to accompany her to her lodgings. I had not enjoyed my tête-à-tête five minutes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was aſtoniſhed at hearing the well-known
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0536900400:218"/>
thunder of the voice of Jack N—tt. <q rend="inline">"'Sblood and 'oons, you old harridan, ſhe is mine for a month; and I would rather loſe fifty per cent. than lend her for a ſingle night to the deareſt friend upon earth."</q> To this vociferous exclamation the venerable matron replied: <q rend="inline">"Won't Miſs Kitty do for once, or Polly, or Miſs Nancy?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"I'll have no Miſs, but Fanny, by G—,"</q> replied Jack, burſting into the parlour upon us. I was now ſufficiently in the ſecret, and not diſpleaſed at find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my charmer no veſtal. Jack, who had paid fifty pounds for his month, inſiſted on his right of purchaſe; but Miſs Fanny thinking me a better pay-maſter, heroically turned him out of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; telling him, for his comfort, that he ſhould have his month another time. Miſs Fanny pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ſo well, that before I was weary of her I had ſunk another thouſand; when, in a fit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, I bid her adieu, and left her to Jack, and the reſt of her monthly keepers.</p>
            <p>To make a little digreſſion, I think this method of hiring for a month preferable to the wholeſale bargains for life, and of mutual advantage to the keeper and kept, if that form will ſtand good in law, for a man will find it all rapture and love,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0536900400:219"/>
without diſguſt; and in a few months play the the ſame part over again, with no decay of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
            <p>Jack N—tt is now a principal merchant, and rolls about in his coach and four to every public dinner; where his appetite and ſolidity of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the edible way, does honour to the city. It is notorious that he is a cuckold, and by more than one method free of his company; but that is no detriment to him in the ſcale of mercantile me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The extraordinary buſtle he has made in a late political affair, is very little to his advantage; but it muſt be obſerved in his defence, that the earl of H—lſb—h did him the greateſt act of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip mortal man could do him, viz. invited him to a turtle-feaſt, and revealed to him a ſecret in the culinary art, till then utterly unknown to all the world but his lordſhip and his cook. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed pretended to ſay, that this ſecret is nothing more than giving veniſon an additional flavour, by baſting it with a preparation of French cheeſe and rancid butter; but as I would not preſume to give my opinion in a matter of ſuch importance, I ſhall leave Jack to the pleaſure of the table, and proceed in my relation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0536900400:220"/>
On this conſiderable decay of my fortune, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider ſeriouſly of my departed father's curious advice; and in conſequence of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, reſolved to ſet up for a fortune-hunter, and retrieve my affairs in the ſober track of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. A Miſs L—n was the girl I had fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and accordingly dreſſed at. She raiſed my hopes, and gratified my vanity by ſeveral ſignificant glances; and I was ſo certain of carrying her off in the end, that I chearfully launched out five hundred pounds in dreſs and equipage; which had ſuch an amazing effect, that in three weeks time I had three kiſſes of her hand, and in the fourth week ſhe took a trip to Scotland with her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's footman. This unexpected ſtroke created in me an abſolute averſion to matrimony, and a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution not to endeavour to better myſelf by the hymenial knot.</p>
            <p>Soon after this affair I made an acquaintance with the wife of an alderman: I ſhall conceal his name, as his patriotic behaviour has rendered him reſpectable in the city. Mrs. — was of an amorous complexion: her huſband had too much of the citizen to be like her: turtle, veniſon, and popularity, were the only objects of his attention,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0536900400:221"/>
out of the compting-houſe. Though he has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repeated three periods with propriety, except when aſſiſted by the ingenious device of placing the ready-made ſpeech in the crown of his hat; yet his mercantile genius has often ſtruck upon very lucky hits. He is unrivalled in reckoning the amount of rate per cent. and no ſtock-broker at Jonathan's can whiſper a piece of ſecret intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with half his dexterity. Between you and I and the poſt, Mr. Editor, the ſtopping the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of bad halfpence, inconſiderable as the coin may appear to ſome, has brought him in no leſs than ſeven thouſand pounds, and increaſed the trade of him and his partners amazingly.</p>
            <p>Mrs. — had penetration enough to find out my good qualities; and you will ſuppoſe, that I was not wanting in acknowledging her partiality. We had frequent interviews at the houſe of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital miliner in the Strand, and the amour for ſome time went ſwimmingly on.</p>
            <p>Mrs. — was under no apprehenſions of my being ſatiated with enjoyment? for generouſly conſidering I was but a younger brother, I never ſacrificed on the altar of the Cyprean goddeſs,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0536900400:222"/>
without receiving a bank-bill worth my accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But, alas! happineſs is of ſhort duration; or, to ſpeak in the language of the high-ſounding Oſſian, <q rend="inline">"Behold! thou art happy; but ſoon, ah! ſoon, wilt thou be miſerable. Thou art as eaſy and tranquil as the face of the green-mantled pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; but ſoon, ah! ſoon, wilt thou be tumbled and toſſed by misfortunes, like the ſtream of the water-mill. Thou art beautiful as the cathederal of Canterbury; but ſoon wilt thou be deformed like Chineſe palace-paling. So the ſun riſing in the eaſt gilds the borders of the black mountains, and laces with his golden rays the dark-brown heath. The hind leaps over the ſlowery lawn, and the reeky bull rolls in the bubbling brook. The wild boar makes ready his armour of defence. The inhabitants of the rocks dance, and all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture joins in the ſong. But ſee! riding on the wings of the wind, the black clouds fly. The noiſy thunders roar; the rapid lightnings gleam; the rainy torrents pour, and the dropping ſwain flies over the mountain: ſwift as Bickerſtaff, the ſon of ſong, when the monſter Bumbailiano, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the dark and black cave, purſued him over the hills of death, and the green meadows of dark men."</q> O, Oſſian! immortal genius! what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0536900400:223"/>
could I make now! but I ſhall leave it to the abler pen of Mr. Duff, and ſpin out the thread of my own adventures.</p>
            <p>Mrs. — having diſpatched a billet to me, I flew to her in her own houſe. The knight, as ſhe thought, was fixed to the table of Sir Tunbelly Grains, knight, citizen, and alderman, who had invited him to dinner on a delicious tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: a bleſſing not to be neglected. But, Oh! grief of griefs! the knight having forgot his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite tobacco-box, popped in upon us unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly, and found us too familiarly engaged. Inſtead of burſting into the rage which might have animated an Italian or Spaniard on the occaſion, he ſhook his head, and pronouncing coolly, <q rend="inline">"Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine, all very fine!"</q> he left us, and returned to Sir Tunbelly to finiſh the turtle. As by his haſty throwing open the door he had expoſed us to the view of two of his ſervants, I was terribly afraid of a proſecution for <hi>crim. con.</hi> for though it was as faſhionable then as it is now, I was not very eager to loſe the remainder of my fortune faſhionably. But the knight conſidering his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation would receive a ſevere ſtroke, ſhould the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair be made public, contented himſelf with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0536900400:224"/>
two thouſand pounds for the injury I had done him. As he threatened to proſecute for lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger damages, unleſs I complied, I was obliged to refund more than Mrs. —'s bounty had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon me.</p>
            <p>The old curmudgeon had heartily provoked me, and I reſolved, though at the expence of every ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling I had, to be revenged on him. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I publiſhed the whole affair, and the devil aſſiſting my invention, I ſtruck upon another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to gratify my vengeance.</p>
            <p>The knight's eldeſt daughter, Sabina, whom he had by a former wife, was a fine ſprightly girl, and wanted nothing but the <hi>bon ton</hi> to render her perfectly accompliſhed; about eighteen, a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fine complexion, and expreſſive blue eyes. She was at the time of the unlucky diſcovery with a relation in Eſſex: as I had formerly paid a few compliments to her beauty, which I had reaſon to ſay, without vanity, were not ill received, I inſtantly diſpatched an epiſtle to her, the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my imagination could dictate. It wrought the effect I deſigned, and ſhe returned an anſwer. After a long farce of lying and intriguing on my
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0536900400:225"/>
part, and credulity on hers, I accompliſhed the grand end—you will gueſs what I mean.</p>
            <p>We lived in love and rapture about a month, when her father bid her prepare to marry Mr. Luteſtring, the mercer, by the next week. She flew to the uſual place of aſſignation, bathed in tears, with a face expreſſive of the moſt violent grief.</p>
            <p>I was now almoſt perſuaded to love her in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; but I was a Sad Dog to ſuffer revenge (and when I ſeriouſly reflect, a revenge which had no foundation in reaſon) to get the better of every nobler paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"O! my dear Harry,"</q> exclaimed the beautiful unfortunate, <q rend="inline">"let us fly immediately to Scotland, otherwiſe my father, inhuman man! will oblige me to marry Bob Luteſtring next week."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Bob Luteſtring, my dear,"</q> replied I indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently, <q rend="inline">"is a ſubſtantial man, and I would not have you diſoblige your father on my account."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0536900400:226"/>
               <q rend="inline">"And is this your advice!"</q> returned the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine, aſſuming a dignified air: <q rend="inline">"be aſſured, Sir, I ſhall follow it."</q> Saying this, ſhe ſlung from me; her ideas, I ſuppoſe, a little different from thoſe ſhe brought with her.</p>
            <p>But I had not yet accompliſhed my revenge Steeled in impudence as I am, I bluſh to write the reſt; but it ſhall be out. I informed Mr. Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of my intimacy with his future ſpouſe, and adviſed him not to unite himſelf to a woman of ſuch principles. I made certain of receiving a challenge, and a ſtring of curſes for my informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but, alas! I knew not the city. <q rend="inline">"Sir,"</q> replied the mercer, <q rend="inline">"I thank you for your intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, this day received: but your advice is not worth a yard of tape; you ſay Sabina has been faulty; allow it: but will her father give me any thing the leſs for her fortune on that account? on the contrary, were not my notions of honour very refined, I might make it a means of raiſing my price."</q> I ſlunk away, aſtoniſhed at this reply, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting how various are the ſpecies and refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0536900400:227"/>
I was now juſt on the brink of poverty: I had made a conſiderable breach in my laſt five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and began to ſhudder at the contempt with which the decay of my fortune threatened me. Relying on his former profeſſions of friendſhip, I poſted down to Sir Stentor Ranger, in hopes he would have aſſiſted me. I found the knight very buſy, with Sir Charles Banbury, in tracing the honourable pedigree of an Arabian barb. <q rend="inline">"Hey, Hal,"</q> exclaimed the knight, with a voice which would have drowned the full chorus of a fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace; <q rend="inline">"what the devil brought thee here? I thought thou wert grown a gentleman, and had forgotten us all."</q> He received me with as much kindneſs and civility, as his ruſtic breeding would permit, and invited me to his antiquated hall.</p>
            <p>After a noble dinner of veniſon, when Sir Charles had retired, on cracking the nineteenth bottle, I ventured to open the buſineſs. Nothing can expreſs the ſurpriſe which diſtended the knight's ample countenance. I made no very agreeable comments on his aſtoniſhment; but, thank Heaven! thoſe comments were as ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as the Rev. Mr. Bentinck's on the Bible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0536900400:228"/>
               <q rend="inline">"Zounds,"</q> thundered the knight, <q rend="inline">"five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds gone already: you have been a Sad Dog, Hal, that I'll ſay for thee. But, howſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dever, as thou beeſt my nown fleſh and blood, d'ye ſee, I'll do ſomething for thee. Let me ſee, let me ſee: doſt underſtand horſe-fleſh?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwered <q rend="inline">"that I was not very deep in the myſtery, but I hoped, with a little of his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to be ſerviceable to him."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Adad, thou art in the right, Hal, nobody knows theſe things better than me. There's my lord Groſvenor's filly, Long Dick; he would have it, that he was got by his own horſe, Thunder, when I, by the mere make of his paſtern, found 'um out, to be got by Sir George Blunt's white horſe, Duke. Doſt know any thing of dogs? Canſt train a pointer, or a hawk, or ſuch like things?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"This,"</q> I replied, <q rend="inline">"I could with ſafety un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Well then, zay no more; no more words to the matter: I'll do for thee; thou ſhalt have one hundred and fifty pounds a year, and ſo ge'es
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0536900400:229"/>
thy hand, Hal. A bargain's a bargain; I ſcorn to flinch from my word: thou ſhalt ha'it, odzookers, thou ſhalt ha'it."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In conſequence of this bargain I commenced ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendant of his ſtables and kennels. I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my office much to his ſatisfaction; and by dint of application acquiring ſome knowledge in the myſteries of the turf, I began to be of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the racing world. Sir Stentor's hall was very ancient, and had been in days of yore a family ſeat of the Mowbrays. It had not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone any conſiderable reparation ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; when an anceſtor of Sir Stentor's, having often had quarrels with a neighbouring abbot, in the ſacrilegious pillage, purchaſed his abbey for leſs than the one-twentieth of its value; and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it of all its ornaments and painted glaſs, made the abbey a ſtable, and turned his dogs into the chapel.</p>
            <p>Sir Stentor had many curious viſitors, on account of his antient painted glaſs-windows; among the reſt was the redoubted baron Otranto, who has ſpent his whole life in conjectures. This moſt ingenious gentleman, as a certain advertiſer ſtiles
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0536900400:230"/>
him, is certainly a good judge of paintings, and has an original, eaſy manner of writing. That his knowledge in antiquity equals his other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments may be diſputed. As Sir Stentor had ever been politically attached to his family, he welcomed the the baron with every demonſtration of joy, and ordered the bells of the pariſh church to be rung. As a further teſtimony of his joy, he ſent for a blind fidler, the Barthelemon of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, to entertain the baron with a ſolo during din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and after the deſert, Robin Hood's Ramble was melodiouſly chaunted by the knight's groom and dairy-maid, to the excellent muſic of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringed violin, and a bag-pipe. A concert by the firſt maſters in Europe could not have pleaſed the baron ſo well: he imagined himſelf carried back to the age of his favourite hero, Richard the Third.</p>
            <p>Should any critic aſſert, that it is impoſſible ſuch an imagination could enter the <hi>cerebellum</hi> of the baron, who confines all his ideas with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the narrow limits of propriety (for the ſongs of Robin Hood were not in being till the reign of queen Elizabeth) his aſſertion ſhall ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradicted by me, as I know, by woeful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0536900400:231"/>
that when an author reſolves to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the right, it is more than human argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can do to convince him he is in the wrong.</p>
            <p>The baron, after dinner, aſked the knight if he had ever diſcovered in any place about his houſe an eſcutcheon argent, on a feſſe gules; three garbs, or; between as many ſhields, ſable, cheveronny of the firſt?</p>
            <p>To this learned interrogatory the knight anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſtare of aſtoniſhment, and <q rend="inline">"Anon, Sir, what d'ye talk of? I don't underſtand ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh lingo, not I, for my part."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Otranto finding it impoſſible to enter into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſuitable to his hobby-horſe, begged leave to viſit the kennel, deſiring the knight to permit the huntſman to go with him, leſt the dogs might not be over civil to a ſtranger.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Odzookers,"</q> cried Sir Stentor, <q rend="inline">"are you afraid of the dogs? I'll go with you myſelf, man."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0536900400:232"/>
The baron found many things worthy his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the ruinated chapel; but the knight was ſo full of the praiſes of his harriers, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary had not opportunity to form one conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. After looking round the chapel for ſome moveable piece of age, on which he might em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his ſpeculative talents, to the eternal honour of his judgment, he pitched upon a ſtone which had no antiquity at all; and, tranſported with his fancied prize, placed it upon his head, and bore it triumphantly to his chamber, deſiring the knight to give him no diſturbance the next day, as he intended to devote it to the ſervice of futurity.</p>
            <p>This important piece of ſtone had by the huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man been ſacrilegiouſly ſtolen from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing church-yard, and employed with others to ſtop up a breach in the kennel, through which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous Jowler had ſqueezed his lank carcaſe.</p>
            <p>Nothing can eſcape the clutches of curioſity. The letters being ill cut, had an appearance of ſomething Gothic; and the baron was ſo far gone in this Quixotiſm of literature, that at the firſt glance he determined them to be of the third Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic alphabet of Wormius.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0536900400:233"/>
The original inſcription was: James Hicks lieth here, with Heſter his wife.</p>
            <p>The broken ſtone is here represented, <figure/>
            </p>
            <p>The baron having turned over Camden, Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, Leyland, and Wever, at laſt determined it to be, <hi>Hic jacet corpus Kenelmae Sancto Legero. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quicſeat,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. What confirmed him in the above reading, and made it impoſſible for him to be miſtaken, was, that a great man of the name of Sancto Legero, had been buried in the county about five hundred years ago.</p>
            <p>Elated with the happy diſcovery, the Baron had an elegant engraving of the curioſity executed, and preſented it to the ſociety of antiquaries, who look upon it as one of the moſt important diſcoveries which have been made ſince the great Dr. Trefoil found out, that the word <hi>kine</hi> came from the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

When this miracle of literature left the village, the bells were again rung, and the baron was wrapped in Elyſium on the ſucceſs of his viſit.</p>
            <p>I had ſerved Sir Stentor above two years, when, by a lucky hit, Sir Charles Banbury and myſelf took the whole field in, and cleared above twenty thouſand pounds; eight thouſand of which fell to my ſhare.</p>
            <p>I was now once more eſtabliſhed in the world, and redeemed from the dependance which had mortified my pride. As I was ſeldom ungrateful, I repaid Sir Stentor's kindneſs, by revealing to him the whole <hi>arcana</hi> of the turf; which he has improved to ſo much advantage, that he has added five hundred <hi>per annum</hi> to his paternal eſtate, by his ſucceſſes at Newmarket.</p>
            <p>In proſperity I never gave ear to the ſage whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Prudence; her cool advice was never felt, but in the winter of adverſity. I was fluſh, and reſolved to go over to Paris, and glitter in all the ſplendor of an Engliſhman. This rapid reſolution was as rapidly executed, and in leſs than ten days
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0536900400:235"/>
after my ſucceſs I found myſelf at the city of noiſe and frippery.</p>
            <p>I had too much ſpirit to murmur at the expence, but I often wiſhed for ſomething more ſubſtantial, than <hi>ſoup</hi> or <hi>fricaſée:</hi> after living at the gigantic table of Sir Stentor, and feaſting on roaſt beef and veniſon, I found it difficult to ſwallow liquids and ſhadows. But every other conſideration was ſoon drowned in that of a young marchioneſs, who never met my eyes without telling them ſuch a tale of love, that it was impoſſible not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.</p>
            <p>I directed my valet La Foſſe, to make every poſſible enquiry after her: he brought me intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that ſhe was the widow of a marquis, and of a very noble family. This was ſufficient: I inſtantly diſpatched a meſſenger of love to her: and 'ere another moon had gilded up her horns, married her. But I had cauſe to repent my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; ſhe was indeed the widow of a marquis, but one of the pooreſt of that title in France; his debts were great, and his widow inſtead of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging them, had contracted more, her noble family not being able to ſupport her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0536900400:236"/>
I was ſoon rouzed from my dream of happineſs, and thrown into priſon; my fortune was inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to procure my liberty, and there I ſhould have periſhed, had not an old rich farmer-general taken my wife under his protection, paid her debts, generouſly ſet me free, and preſented me with a bill of two hundred pounds, on condition I returned to England. I did not chuſe to reject his offer, and with that ſort of pſeudo-repentance, which generally waits on us when we are grown wiſe too late, took my leave of France and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.</p>
            <p>Immediately on my return to England, I waited on Sir Stentor; but the knight knowing my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius in horſe-fleſh, was not willing to put me in a condition of rivalling him upon the turf.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Zounds, Hal, whoy thou ſpendeſt every thing: no, no, I duont want a top game-keeper now. Here, I'll gi' thee this bill of one hundred pounds, and my bay gelding Jockey: go and ſee 'un, he is as fine a beaſt as any I have in hand."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I thought it not prudent to refuſe the knight's offer; and making the beſt of a bad bargain, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0536900400:237"/>
Jockey, and the bill, and made the beſt of my way to London.</p>
            <p>Here, after a long deliberation, I reſolved to turn ſtock-jobber: and the firſt time I viſited Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than's, by propagating a report that Jamaica was taken by the Spaniards, increaſed my ſmall ſum to two thouſand pounds. I was now in raptures, and ſaw once again the viſions of good fortune ſwimming before my ſight. I ſtill continued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving my principal, when an account from Trieſte reduced me to ſeven hundred; and in a few days after, another account from the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate place, utterly ruined me, and I wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled a lame duck out of the alley.</p>
            <p>What could I now do? As to mechanic buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I was utterly a ſtranger to it, and my ſoul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the livery of a ſlave. I had diſtracted my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with reflection, till the laſt bill of ten pounds was mutilated, when I thought of ſetting up for an author.</p>
            <p>As I did not doubt my invention, and had va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity enough for the character, I ſat down to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the muſes. The firſt fruits of my pen, were
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0536900400:238"/>
a political eſſay and a piece of poetry: the firſt I carried to a patriotic bookſeller, who is, in his own opinion, of much conſequence to the cauſe of liberty; and the poetry was left with another of the ſame tribe, who made bold to make it a means of puffing his Magazine, but refuſed any gratuity. Mr. Britannicus, at firſt imagining the piece was not to be paid for, was laviſh of his praiſes, and I might depend upon it, it ſhould do honour to his flaming patriotic paper; but when he was told that I expected ſome recompence, he aſſumed an air of criticiſm, and begged my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; he did not know that circumſtance, and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he did not think it good language, or ſound reaſoning.</p>
            <p>I was not diſcouraged by the objections and criticiſms of the bookſelling tribe; and as I know the art of Curliſm, pretty well, I make a tolerable hand of it. But, Mr. Printer, the late proſecution againſt the bookſellers having frightened them all out of their patriotiſm, I am neceſſitated either to write for the entertainment of the public, or in defence of the miniſtry. As I have ſome little remains of conſcience, the latter is not very agreeable. Political writing, of either
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0536900400:239"/>
ſide of the queſtion, is of little ſervice to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment or inſtruction of the reader. Abuſe and ſcurrillity are generally the chief figures in the language of party. I am not of the opinion of thoſe authors, who deem every man in place a raſcal, and every man out of place a patriot.</p>
            <p>Permit this then to appear in your univerſally admired Magazine; it may give ſome entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your reader, and a dinner to</p>

            <p>LEST your Hunter of Oddities ſhould meet with me, and cook up my ſingularity as a diſh of diverſion for the town, I trouble you with a deſcription of myſelf. Have you ever ſeen a portait by Holbein, or the figure of an old fellow in ancient tapeſtry? I am a laughable counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to either of theſe curioſities. I am heir to no inconſiderable eſtate, which has but one incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance on it; a plaguy, long-lived, ſurly dog of a father.</p>
            <p>If I am not miſtaken the Roman-catholics make longevity one of the peculiar gifts of heaven. I confeſs I am ſo irreligious as to wiſh heaven had been leſs ſparing of its gifts to my honoured papa. You will ſay I am an ungracious child, perhaps; but when you have got to the end of my epiſtle, you will excuſe me. If abſurdities and follies are the general attendants of age, I cannot ſee with what juſtice grey-hairs command veneration.</p>
            <p>

My father has as well furniſhed a wardrobe as any knight in the ſhire; but not an individual garment in it which has been made ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution.</p>
            <p>My father dreſſes in the uniform of a courtier in the reign of James I. his hat is like a ſtrawberry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſket, with the handle thruſt under his chin: this piece of ornament belonged to Robert Carey, who, as he was a great man in his time, and nearly related to our family, muſt not be out of remembrance. He wears alſo an enormous ruff, once the property of Sir Veniſon Gooſepye, lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayor of London, who, though of a younger branch of the family, eſtabliſhed it on a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable footing than before, by doubling its rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll. Gratitude obliges my ſire to wear this ruff, though as full of holes as a lawyer's conſcience. A flaſhed doublet, with ſlit ſleeves, and a long cloak, envelopes his trunk; and a monſtrous pair of trunk-hoſe, ſquare ſhoes, and large ſhoe-roſes, conclude his bundle of ridiculous habiliments. Could I perſuade him to be contented with mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf laughed at, I ſhould be happy in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining my friends with the oddity of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; but when I conſider that mine is equally
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0536900400:242"/>
as laughable, I ſicken at the ſight of his antiquated garb. I am almoſt aſhamed to deſcribe myſelf; but in hopes that he muſt ſoon ſet out on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the other world, I make a virtue of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and comply. He abſolutely threatens to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit me, if I grumble at dreſſing for the memory of the departed; and an eſtate of ſix-thouſand <hi>per annum,</hi> is not to be loſt for the ſake of a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimmed ſuit, and a gold button. My hair is dreſſed in a very peculiar and riſible manner; it is cut cloſe on the middle of the head, and twiſted like a horſe's mane on each ſide: this my papa avers was the moſt polite faſhion in the reign of queen Elizabeth, as appears by the portrait of his great uncle, Sir Henry Dainty. This Sir Henry was the greateſt beau of his time, and is thought by a learned antiquary to be the identical perſon for whom Shakeſpeare drew the character of Oſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick in Hamlet. My hat is not quite ſo comical as my ſire's; it inclines more to the ſhape of a cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool-pan, pardon the ſimile, you will find it in another author, it is too delicate to be my own. This ornament of the head once graced the <hi>caput</hi> of the profound Dr. Technicus, who had an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal noſtrum which enabled him to ride in his chair; and what do you think this noſtrum was?
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0536900400:243"/>
Nothing but a cataplaſm of maſticated bread and butter. My ruff is perfectly yellow: but as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the reverend Dr. Drouzy, my father makes it a point of conſcience to oblige me to wear it. I have a large jutting coat and wide breeches, the very tip of the mode in the days of Henry VII. mottled ſtocking, red and green, and ſhoes with monſtrous pikes complete my ornamentals.</p>
            <p>This, Mr. Printer, is a perfect repreſentation of my externals. Do be ſo obliging as to give the old fellow a hint in your Magazine, that he acts very ridiculouſly. He has already felt the bad effects of his antiquated wardrobe. My ſiſter was as laughable as myſelf; ſhe wore a hood of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable thick velvet, which projected on each ſide of her face, like a horſe's blinds; her ruff was enormous, and betwixt that and her head-gear there was nothing but the tip of her noſe to be ſeen: her ſtays reached down to her knees, her ſtockings were yellow, and her ſhoes ſquare-toed. All theſe ornaments had in the days of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, glittered on Alice Sevenoke, a maid of honour to queen Mary, who was famous for making cuſtards, and giving eel-pies an excellent reliſh. My ſiſter Biddy's gown was as heavy as
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0536900400:244"/>
a modern novel: upon a moderate computation it had above three pounds of ſilver, in its embroidery: the colours indeed were faded, but that defect was made up in the lenghth of the train, which afforded the cat a five minutes play while Miſs Biddy was turning the corner.</p>
            <p>A female muſt neceſſarily be worſe qualified to bear this purgatory than a man; and ſhe having fifteen thouſand pounds, which an old aunt had left her to be paid at her marriage, whipped off to Scotland, at the age of ſixteen, with a young fellow in the army. Would I could make my eſcape too, from the tyranny of this taylor of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity! I am ſenſible no character at Cornelys's could make ſo ridiculous an appearance as I do.</p>
            <p>Oh, dear Mr. Ham, if you have any bowels of compaſſion, addreſs a line or two to the old prig: ſhew him how barbarous it is to deprive a young fellow of all the pleaſures of life, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge an unaccountable whim: puſh the matter home to him; and, if you ſucceed, you ſhall ever have the prayers of</p>

               <p>I Think Addiſon ſays, in defining a complete fine gentleman, that even dreſs ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to; and, indeed, it has ſo great an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in moſt ſituations of this life, that a perſon who is entirely negligent of it will find himſelf either overlooked or deſpiſed in the uſual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſociety.</p>
               <p>There are, indeed, ſome ſingular characters, who pique themſelves upon an utter contempt for dreſs; but to the ſhame of men of letters be it ſaid, that theſe are generally pedants, or ſuch as value themſelves upon an affected abſence from the trivial purſuits of this world.</p>
               <p>Dick Flighty, is a man of a very different caſt from theſe: dreſs he conſiders as the ultimate end of exiſtence; and he would be miſerable for a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0536900400:246"/>
year if lord M—, or captain G—, was to have a new faſhoned <hi>cut,</hi> from Paris before him. He was the firſt who introduced the Tambour waiſtcoat: he rode poſt from that metropolis, with ſix horſes, to be here in time. This he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a very capital ſtroke in eſtabliſhing his faſhionable character; and which he looked upon as indiſpenſable, when Sir James G— appeared in a ſilver ſilk flowered embroidery, before he had recieved intelligence of the invention. His diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace upon this occaſion was inexpreſſible; and had he not retrieved himſelf in the violet birds eye velvet, on the enſuing birth-day, the conſequence might have been fatal.</p>
               <p>Dick is poſſeſſed of about four thouſand a year, which he lays out, in his opinion, to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. He neither games nor drinks, which conſidering the licentiouſneſs of the age, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary: but then he keeps as elegant an equipage as any man in town, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly uſes: beſides this, he has a fine pack of hounds, though he never hunts, four race-horſes, though he never ſports; and keeps three miſtreſſes, whom he never viſits.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0536900400:247"/>
To be ingenuous, Dick may be fairly claſſed as the ſovereign of <hi>petit maitres,</hi> the prince of fops, and the repreſentative-general of coxcombs: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, Dick, is an arrant ſloven. Whilſt he is driving from one end of the town to the other, in ſearch of the moſt celebrated embroiderer, to give him directions concerning a new invented ſprig, his <hi>chapeau de bras,</hi> which he wears on his head, would be a diſgrace to a hair dreſſer; and the back of his coat is more greaſy than a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher's; but then this is the <hi>ton.</hi> Dick holds it as an invariable maxim, that a clean coat and a good hat, in an undreſs, would be a diſgrace to a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and bring him upon a level with a <hi>bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geois.</hi>

               <p>FINDING you gave place to my Odd Man in your laſt, I have ſent you another to hand up in the group; and as I ſhall let you have one every month, we ſhall by the end of the year complete our collection.</p>
               <p>Dick Slender is now about his forty-fifth year, ſix feet high, without any incumbrance of fleſh. He is one of thoſe people who ſaunter about town and call themſelves gentlemen, becauſe they have nothing to do, and are incapable of doing any thing.</p>
               <p>Dick, upon the death of his father, became poſſeſſed of three thouſand pounds in the funds; he was deſtined to the bar, and had been brought up in the Temple; but finding in himſelf very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſpoſition for the Statutes at Large, or Coke upon Littleton, he ſhut up his folios, and reſolved to be the man of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0536900400:249"/>
He ſoon diſcovered, however, that the intereſt of his money, at three per cent. would not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him in the line of life he had chalked out; and, therefore, ſunk the capital in the purchaſe of an annuity, and caring for neither man, woman, or child, eats, drinks, and dreſſes up to one hundred and eighty pounds per annum.</p>
               <p>Dick is always the firſt night at a new play in the pit; and though he never read Ariſtotle, or underſtands a ſyllable of Horace, he is one of the greateſt critics of the age. He has learnt a few ſet-phraſes at the Bedford: theſe he utters promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly upon all ſuch occaſions, and he blends them in ſo curious a manner that they will do for any performance of every degree of merit. He, nevertheleſs, has, frequently, a crowd about him at the coffee-houſe; and his deciſions, indeciſive as they be, are conſidered as the opinion of the town.</p>
               <p>His ſucceſs in gallantry is not leſs conſpicuous than his judgment in criticiſm; if a number of letters conſtantly addreſſed to him in a female, hand, often ſealed with a coronet, can authenticate his intrigues, or prove that half the women of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0536900400:250"/>
faſhion in England are enamoured with him. But unfortunately he lately quarrelled with his waſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman upon the loſs of ſome ſilk ſtockings, and ſhe has revealed a ſecret that has baniſhed him from George's for theſe three weeks. She was the amanuenſis, the correſponding ladies, and the deliverer of all theſe letters to the parties who brought them to this coffee-houſe; and ſhe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to keep the ſeal, with the coronet, for her trouble. This ſhe has revealed to ſeveral of her cuſtomers in the Temple, at the ſame time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that notwithſtanding the many intrigues ſhe had carried on with Dick Slender, and though ſhe had often been alone with him in private, he had never once offered a rude thing to her: yet Jenny is but two and twenty, has a very wanton eye, and a good complexion.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate Dick's character ſtill farther, he is a politician; he has read all Junius's letters, and can make out every daſh; he is a member of the Bill of Rights: harangues at the Smyrna upon the Middleſex election; and propoſes queſtions at the Robin-hood upon the legality of incapacitation. It is true, that all his political reading has been confined to the Public and the Gazetteer; but no
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0536900400:251"/>
man underſtands the real <hi>nature of our conſtitution; the eſſence of our rights and liberties; the limits of the prerogative; the extent of parliamentary privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges; the nature of our foreign connections, or the balance of power,</hi> better, or more profoundly, than DICK SLENDER—by <hi>intuition!</hi>

               <p>THIS metropolis abounds with ſo many oddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that I am ſometimes at a loſs to hit upon one for the month. I have now in my col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection about three dozen, that will do either for winter or ſummer: their peculiarities are of ſuch a nature, and they are ſuch complete originals, they never can be unſeaſonably hung up to public view. But a truce with preface, or elſe, perhaps, you will think me worthy a place in my own col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
               <p>Eolus is as variable in his temper as the thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>two points of the compaſs; but it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that a coach has to him all the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic qualities of the load-ſtone, eſpecially when the wind is in his chops. But why confine his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in ſo ſmall a compaſs? Eolus is every body, and every thing at times: he eats like Quin, drinks with Rigby, intrigues with a Cumb—d, and fights with every man that never exiſted. He is a buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram hero, and, if I might be allowed a taylor's

pun, you may twiſt him to what you pleaſe. It is time, however, to bring forth our hero, and let him ſpeak for himſelf.</p>

                  <p>Yes, Jack, I muſt acknowledge you do make me eat a pound more ſince you came to the houſe, than ever I did before. I ſhall juſt take a turn in a hack round the new buildings, Groſvenor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare, and Marybone, by way of a whet, and be here preciſely at four.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>So ſhort a dialogue, dear Ham, cannot certainly diſguſt your readers; but, perhaps, they may be curious to know how many he has to dine with
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0536900400:254"/>
him? Juſt as many as a certain r—l lover found, when he awoke and met with nobody but himſelf.</p>
               <p>Eolus ſeems to have followed Quin's rule, which I ſhall exemplify. Said lady T—ſh—d (I mean the modeſt lady T—ſh—d) to Quin: <q rend="inline">"I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Mr. Quin, that you do not marry, take a houſe, and keep an equipage."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Why lookye, my lady, I like the ſweets of matrimony without the bitters—I always carry my wife, my coach, and my cook in my pocket, and when they diſpleaſe me, jolt me into a paſſion, or ſpoil my appetite, I turn them off."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Quin was ſo pregnant of good things, that the very mention of him, engenders a number; but I ſhall take up your reader's time with the relation of only one more, which he ſaid to the ſame lady, upon a ſomewhat ſimilar occaſion. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Mr. Quin,"</q> ſaid ſhe, <q rend="inline">"did you ever make love?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"No, my lady,"</q> replied Sir John Bruce, <q rend="inline">"I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways buy it ready made."</q>
               </p>
               <p>So much for Quin; now once more for Eolus: he is about five ſeet nothing; as round as a hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhead, owing to his eating immoderately; rides in a hack all the morning to create an appetite; rides
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0536900400:255"/>
in the ſame vehicle all the afternoon to promote digeſtion. He has ſeven hundred a year, of which he does not ſave a farthing, which he diſpoſes of chiefly to hackney-coachmen and vintners. The ladies, however, ingroſs ſome part of his purſe, as well as his perſon; but he is an oeconomiſt in love, at leaſt with regard to property, which he transfers to them very ſparingly.</p>
               <p>If after this any one ſhould think Eolus the mere puff of imagination, he may be ſeen alive eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day at four, not a hundred yards from War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick-court, Holborn.</p>

               <p>LOUNGING the other day at Slaughter's cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houſe, I made acquaintance with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who has turned out a proper candidate to be enrolled in your liſt of oddities.</p>
               <p>He had been reading the Gazetteer for about twenty minutes, in the courſe of which he had taken as many pinches of ſnuff, when he ſtarted all at once, and giving a fling to the paper, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a diſh of ſcalding coffee upon a gentleman's white ſilk ſtockings, crying, <q rend="inline">"Zounds, there he is again—how he ſtinks!"</q> then riſing up without paying any attention to the miſchief he had done, or making the leaſt apology to the gentleman whoſe legs he had ſcalded, he walked three or four times up and down the room ſhaking his arm and fingers, crying out, <q rend="inline">"Keep off, keep off."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I did not know what to conclude from his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; but as I was the neareſt to him during his exclamation, and this perambulation, I thought it
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0536900400:257"/>
neceſſary to aſk him whether he propoſed inſulting me—to which he made no reply, but muttered <q rend="inline">"The devil opened my curtains laſt night, and he has been after me all day."</q> Then ſhaking his hand more violently than ever, <q rend="inline">"there you are off at laſt."</q> After this curious ſoliloquy, he began to grow a little calm, ſeated himſelf upon another of the benches, and ordered a pint of milk. He then pulled out of his pocket ſeveral old pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and read them very attentively, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ejaculating now and thee, <q rend="inline">"Off, you villain, off,"</q> and ſhaking his hand and arm very violently.</p>
               <p>I enquired at the bar, who this extraordinary perſon was, and whether he was out of his mind; when I was informed, that he was Mr. Ha—w—y, brother to the commiſſioner of that name; that he had frequented the houſe ſeveral years, and that he was a very inoffenſive, good-natured man.</p>
               <p>Having received this intelligence, I reſolved to have a little converſation with him, when I found him very rational upon every ſubject, except the devil: but the ſlighteſt hint about that infernal being, made him ſhake his hand and arm, and cry out, <q rend="inline">"Off—off."</q>

                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0536900400:258"/>
It would be doing this gentleman a great piece of ſervice, if any of your ingenious correſpondents could hit upon ſome probable ſcheme of exorci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this ſame devil out of poor Ha—w—y, who would then in every reſpect be an agreeable and worthy member of ſociety.</p>

            <p>THOUGH I have much reaſon to think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf qualified for ſociety, I am, to my great mortification, confided in a boarding-ſchool; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I am not debarred the pleaſure of reading. I know all the real names of your <hi>téte à tétes;</hi> and am very well ſkilled in decyphering an aſteriſm or daſh. I have peruſed every novel publiſhed by Lowndes or Noble; and could, upon occaſion, compile a ſecret hiſtory, as pathetic and moving as any other female author. There is no modern play which I have not read; from the bright ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Foote, to the dull dialogue of Cumberland. You ſee I am a judge of theatrical merit: my knowledge of the drama, is hereditary; for my couſin Ben, who underſtands heraldry, can prove himſelf (and conſequently me) to be deſcended from Ben Jonſon's grandmother's ſiſter. So much for internal merit. The young fox-hunters in the neighbourhood ſwear I am a woundy pretty maid! The politer ſort proteſt before gad, I am
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0536900400:260"/>
an angel; and Madame Gouvernante, tells me, I am very fair, very elegant, and every way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. You will excuſe this deſcription of myſelf, as it is a true, though trite obſervation, that few readers regard any hiſtory 'till they are minutely acquainted with the author: my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in writing, was to aſk your advice. Now you muſt know Mr. Ham, that I have ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, at my own diſpoſal; a qualification, which may, in your opinion, exceed all the others I value myſelf upon. My father, who is a plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſort of a man, and upon Briſtol exchange, (or rather in the ſtreet) has the character of a rich merchant, who knows how to live in the world, deſigns to marry me to Bob Barter, the hopeful ſon of his good friend Hezekiah Barter. Bob is, in the polite language of Briſtol, a devil of a buck. You may ſee him in the morning, ſitting under a ſhed on the key, regiſtering the weight of ſugars, and in the evening ſhining at a ball. He overturns a baſket of oyſters, or beats a dog, with a better grace than any youthful notary of Bacchus, in that elegant city: the cream of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs. As Madame Gouvernante knows my father's intentions, ſhe very readily permits his intruſions, and takes every opportunity to leave
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0536900400:261"/>
us together. The wretch has never read further than the Gazette, or tables of intereſt; ſo that it is impoſſible to receive a compliment worth accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him. He ſeems to look upon me as already married, and treats me with a ſuitable indifference. Upon the exit of the Gouvernante, he claps on his hat, takes a turn round the room, very politely expoſes his backſide to the fire, and remarks it is very cold, or ſomething of equal importance. I never regard the wretch; but if I am reading, conſider myſelf as alone, and read on. Pray, Mr. Hamilton, is ſuch a contemptible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be treated with more reſpect? Having told you, I do not like this uncivilized Briſtolian, you may imagine a <hi>tendreſſe</hi> for ſome other has made his faults more conſpicuous. You will not be far from the truth. A young author who has read more than, Magliabechi, and wrote more love-letters than Ovid, is continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the nine to deſcribe me; but he never pays a compliment to my perſon, without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant one to my underſtanding. Though I have ten thouſand pounds, he never mentions mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and when it is forced into his diſcourſe, rails at it moſt religiouſly: but he intrigues like a Jeſuit, to be made happy with a <hi>téte à téte</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0536900400:262"/>
or a walk in the wood; but, thank my ſtars! I have always courageouſly denied. He has ſentiment in his common converſation; and is reported to have ruined three young ladies of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Pray, Mr. Hamilton, what am I to do in this caſe? Nothing can be more diſagreeable than this boarding-ſchool: If I am obliged to marry that inſignificant wretch, Bob Barter, will the forced ceremony oblige me to hate my literary lover? Your advice will oblige</p>

            <head>THE UNFORTUNATE FATHERS.</head>
            <p>MR. Sladon, a merchant of Briſtol, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and diligent application to buſineſs, acquired a conſiderable fortune. As he was an enemy to noiſe and pomp, he neither ſet up his carriage, nor endeavoured to make a ſplended ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; his only care centered in Maria, his beautiful daughter: he ſpared no coſts to complete her education; her genius requited his labour; no inſtructions were loſt on her, and ſhe excelled in every qualification, which dignify her ſex. At the age of ſeventeen ſhe was univerſally allowed to be a beauty. The reader will excuſe the writer from giving a deſcription of her perſon; let him cull from the volumes of poets and painters, all his imagination counts beautiful, and throw into it an inexpreſſible ſoftneſs, and he has Maria.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hinckley, whoſe father was cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected in trade with Mr. Sladon, ſtruck with the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0536900400:267"/>
uncommon luſtre of Maria's perſon and mind, intreated his father, to permit him to pay his addreſſes to her. <q rend="inline">"George,"</q> ſaid the prieſt of Mammon, <q rend="inline">"I commend your choice, Miſs Sladon is a very good oeconomiſt, and will have little leſs than a plumb to her fortune: go, and proſper."</q> Young Hinckley aſſured his father he had not the leaſt mercenary view. <q rend="inline">"Away,"</q> replied the old man <q rend="inline">"when you have been as often upon 'Change as me, you'll know better."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Young Hinckley had no cauſe to complain of his reception; Maria had never viewed him with eyes of indifference. Mr. Sladon rejoiced at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed alliance; all was unity and love, and before the expiration of two months, George acquainted his father, that he intended to requeſt Mr. Sladon to fix the day; but was thunderſtruck with his command, that he ſhould not go ſuch lengths till he had further orders from him.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sladon, who was himſelf above deceit, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuſpected it in another; his generous frankneſs laid him open to the vile arts of old Hinckley: after being connected together, the ſpace of a year, he broke, and ruined him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0536900400:268"/>
Maria had by this time conceived the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paſſion for young Hinckley: it was allowable, as ſhe had always conſidered him as her future huſband. No words can deſcribe Hinckley's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of love. Imagine what an effect this ſtroke muſt have upon both. Nothing but imagination can paint it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sladon was only affected for his daughter: his noble ſoul roſe ſuperior to this revolution; he triumphed in poverty, over the wealthy wretch who cauſed his misfortunes. Old Hinckley, whoſe fortune was increaſed, not dimiſhed by this infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous action, perceived with chagrin, his ſon's madneſs for Maria; he endeavoured to divert his attention to objects more rich, and therefore, in his opinion, more deſerving: but he laboured in vain; nothing could abate his love. Mr. Sladon ſaw his paſſion; he pitied him: but could not think of uniting his daughter to a man, whoſe ſuperiority of circumſtances, was derived from his own ruin.</p>
            <p>Old Hinckley, finding all remonſtrances uſeleſs, by ſome mercenary agents, perſuaded Mr. Sladon that young Hinckley was privy to, and aſſiſting in his ruin. The circumſtances made it plauſible;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0536900400:269"/>
he believed it, and forbade him his houſe. Maria would have credited it of any other man; in this caſe it was dubious: her love for him was partial; but as ſhe had looked upon the father formerly in the beſt light, ſhe doubted whether ſhe might not be deceived in the ſon. She was in this wavering opinion, when the only ſervant Mr. Sladon had, brought her a letter from young Hinckley: ſhe knew the hand, ſhe eagerly caught it; ſhe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and dropped it on the ground: after a long ſtruggle between duty and love, ſhe ſent it back unopened. When a perſon of good ſenſe and ſtrong natural parts, has not the happineſs of a religious education, he is generally a Deiſt or Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian. This was the caſe with young Hinckley; his father endeavouring to qualify him for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, neglected Chriſtianity: to the moſt refined notions of honour and morality, he united an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute contempt for religion; his paſſions were violent, but as he was continually on his guard, they ſeldom appeared. When he heard that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria had returned his letter, he raved to the utmoſt extravagance of madneſs; then appearing calm, he ſat down, and writing a letter, ſealed it and left it on the table. Having done this, he went into his chamber, and immediately ſhot himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0536900400:270"/>
Old Hinckley hearing the exploſion, ran from his compter, and aſcending the ſtairs, ſaw his ſon extended breathleſs. He fainted, and continued in that condition, till his ſervants, occaſionally co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, recovered him.</p>
            <p>The letter, which was directed to his father, contained what follows.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>I ſhall not accuſe your conduct, for you are my father; I ſhall only endeavour to vindicate the action I am about to perpetrate. This will be eaſily done. There is a principle in man (a ſhadow of the Divinity) which conſtitutes him the image of God; you may call it conſcience, grace, inſpiration, the ſpirit, or whatever name your education gives it. If a man acts according to this regulator, he is right: if contrary to it, he is wrong. It is an approved truth, that this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple varies in every rational being. As I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile ſuicide to this principle, with me it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no crime. Suicide is ſometimes a noble inſanity of the ſoul: and often the reſult of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and deliberate approbation of the ſoul. If ever a crime it is only ſo to ſociety; there indeed it always appears an irrational emotion: but when

It may ſeem a paradoxical aſſertion, that we cannot do wrong to ourſelves; but it is certain we have power over our own exiſtence. Such is my opinion, and I have made uſe of ſuch power.</p>
