         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE general deſign of the following ſheets is to
inliſt Imagination under the banner of Science; and to
lead her votaries from the looſer analogies, which dreſs out
the imagery of poetry, to the ſtricter, ones which form the
ratiocination of philoſophy. While their particular deſign
is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the knowledge of
Botany, by introducing them to the veſtibule of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
ſcience, and recommending to their attention the
immortal works of the celebrated Swediſh Naturaliſt,
LINNEUS.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Poem, or Economy of Vegetation, the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiology
of Plants is delivered; and the operation of the
Elements, as far as they may be ſuppoſed to affect the
growth of Vegetables. In the ſecond Poem, or Loves of
the Plants, the Sexual Syſtem of Linneus is explained,
with the remarkable properties of many particular plants.</p>

                  <head>APOLOGY.</head>
                  <p>IT may be proper here to apologize for many of the
ſubſequent conjectures on ſome articles of natural philoſophy, as
not being ſupported by accurate inveſtigation or concluſive experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Extravagant theories however in thoſe parts of philoſophy,
where our knowledge is yet imperfect, are not without their uſe;
as they encourage the execution of laborious experiments, or the
inveſtigation of ingeniouſ deductions, to confirm or refute them.
And ſince natural objects are allied to each other by many affinities,
every kind of theoretic diſtribution of them addſ to our knowledge
by developing ſome of their analogies.</p>
                  <p>The Roſicrucian doctrine of Gnomes, Sylphs, Nymphs, and
Salamanders, was thought to afford a proper machinery for a
Botanic poem; as it is probable, that they were originally the
names of hieroglyphic figures repreſenting the elements.</p>
                  <p>Many of the important operations of Nature were ſhadowed or
allegorized in the heathen mythology, as the firſt Cupid ſpringing
from the Egg of Night, the marriage of Cupid and Pſyche, the Rape
of Proſerpine, the Congreſs of Jupiter and Juno, Death and Reſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation
of Adonis, &amp;c. many of which are ingeniouſly explained in
the works of Bacon, Vol. V. p. 47. 4th Edit. London, 1778. The
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0811300400:6"/>
Egyptians were poſſeſſed of many diſcoveries in philoſophy and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry
before the invention of letters; theſe were then expreſſed in
hieroglyphic paintings of men and animals; which after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the alphabet were deſcribed and animated by the poets,
and became firſt the deities of Egypt, and afterwards of Greece and
Rome. Alluſions to thoſe fables were therefore thought proper orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to a philoſophical poem, and are occaſionally introduced
either as repreſented by the poets, or preſerved on the numerous
gems and medallions of antiquity.</p>

The fluid matter of heat is perhaps the moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive element in nature; all other bodies are immerſed in it, and are preſerved in their preſent ſtate of ſolidity or fluidity by the attraction of their particles to the matter of heat. Since all known bodies are contractible into leſs ſpace by depriving them of ſome portion of their heat, and as there is no part of nature totally deprived of heat, there is reaſon to believe that the particles of bodies do not touch, but are held towards each other by their ſelf-attraction, and recede from each other by their attraction to the maſs of heat which ſurrounds them; and thus exiſt in an equilibrium between theſe two powers. If more of the matter of heat be applied to them, they recede further from each other, and become fluid; if ſtill more be applied, they take an aerial form, and are termed Gaſſes by the modern chemiſts. Thus when water is heated to a certain degree, it would inſtantly aſſume the form of ſteam, but for the preſſure of the atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere, which prevents this change from taking place ſo eaſily; the ſame is true of quickſilver, diamonds, and of perhaps all other bodies in Nature; they would firſt become fluid, and then aeriform by appropriated degrees of heat. On the contrary, this elaſtic matter of heat, termed Calorique in the new nomenclature of the French Academicians, is liable to become conſolidated itſelf in its combinations with ſome bodies, as perhaps in nitre, and probably in combuſtible bodies as ſulphur and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal. See note on l. 232, of this Canto. Modern philoſophers have not yet been able to decide whether light and heat be different fluids, or modifications of the ſame fluid, as they have many properties in common.

From having obſerved the gradual evolution of the young animal or plant from its egg or ſeed; and afterwards its ſucceſſive advances to its more perfect ſtate, or maturity; philoſophers of all ages ſeem to have imagined, that the great world itſelf had likewiſe its infancy and its gradual progreſs to maturity; this ſeems to have given origin to the very antient and ſublime allegory of Eros, or Divine Love, producing the world from the egg of Night, as it floated in Chaos. See l. 419. of this Canto.</p>
                              <p>The external cruſt of the earth, as far as it has been expoſed to our view in mines or mountains, countenances this opinion; ſince theſe have evidently for the moſt part had their origin from the ſhells of fiſhes, the decompoſition of vegetables, and the recrements of other animal materials, and muſt therefore have been formed progreſſively from ſmall beginnings. There are likewiſe ſome apparently uſeleſs or incomplete appendages to plants and animals, which ſeem to ſhew they have gradually undergone changes from their original ſtate; ſuch as the ſtamens without anthers, and ſtyles without ſtigmas of several plants, as mentioned in the note on Curcuma, Vol. II. of this work. Such as the halteres, or rudiments of wings of ſome two-winged inſects; and the paps of male animals; thus ſwine have four toes, but two of them are imperfectly formed, and not long enough for uſe. The allantoide in ſome animals ſeems to have become extinct; in others is above tenfold the ſize, which would ſeem neceſſary for its purpoſe. Buffon du Cochon. T. 6. p. 257.

Mr. Herſchel has given a very ſublime and curious account of the conſtruction of the heavens with his diſcovery of ſome thouſand nebulae, or clouds of ſtars; many of which are much larger collections of ſtars, than all thoſe put together, which are viſible to our naked eyes, added to thoſe which form the galaxy, or milky zone, which ſurrounds us. He obſerves that in the vicinity of theſe cluſters of stars there are proportionally fewer ſtars than in other parts of the heavens; and hence he concludes, that they have attracted each other, on the ſuppoſition that infinite ſpace was at firſt equally ſprinkled with them; as if it had at the beginning been filled with a fluid maſs, which had coagulated. Mr. Herſchel has further ſhewn, that the whole ſidereal syſtem is gradually moving round ſome centre, which may be an opake maſs of matter, Philos. Trans. V. LXXIV. If all theſe Suns are moving round ſome great central body; they muſt have had a projectile force, as well as a centripetal one; and may thence be suppoſed to have emerged or been projected from the material, where they were produced. We can have no idea of a natural power, which could project a Sun out of Chaos, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by comparing it to the exploſions or earthquakes owing to the ſudden evolution of aqueous or of other more elaſtic vapours; of the power of which under immeaſurable degrees of heat, and compreſſion, we are yet ignorant.</p>
                              <p>It may be objected, that if the ſtars had been projected from a Chaos by exploſions, that they muſt have returned again into it from the known laws of gravitation; this how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would not happen, if the whole of Chaos, like grains of gunpowder, was exploded at the ſame time, and diſperſed through infinite ſpace at once, or in quick ſucceſſion, in every poſſible direction. The ſame objection may be ſtated againſt the poſſibility of the planets having been thrown from the fun by exploſions; and the ſecondary planets from the primary ones; which will be ſpoken of more at large in the ſecond Canto, but if the planets are ſuppoſed to have been projected from their ſuns, and the ſecondary from the primary ones, at the beginning of their courſe; they might be ſo influenced or diverted by the attractions of the ſuns, or ſun, in their vicinity, as to prevent their tendency to return into the body, from which they were projected.</p>
                              <p>Is theſe innumerable and immenſe ſuns thus riſing out of Chaos are ſuppoſed to have thrown out their attendant planets by new exploſions, as they aſcended; and thoſe their reſpective ſatellites, filling in a moment the immenſity of ſpace with light and motion, a grander idea cannot be conceived by the mind of man.</p>

Mr. Cavendiſh has ſhewn, that the gas called inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable air, is at leaſt ten times lighter than common air; Mr. Lavoiſier contends, that it is one of the component parts of water, and is by him called hydrogene. It is ſuppoſed to afford their principal nouriſhment to vegetables and thence to animals, and is perpetually riſing from their decompoſition; this ſource of it in hot climates, and in ſummer months, is ſo great as to exceed eſtimation. Now if this light gas paſſes through the atmoſphere, without combining with it, it muſt compoſe another atmoſphere over the aerial one; which muſt expand, when the preſſure above it is thus taken away, to inconceivable tenuity.</p>
                              <p>If this ſupernatural gaſſeous atmoſphere floats upon the aerial one, like ether upon water, what muſt happen? l. it will flow from the line, where it will be produced in the greateſt quantities, and become much accumulated over the poles of the earth; 2. the common air, or lower ſtratum of the atmoſphere, will be much thinner over the poles than at the line; becauſe if a glaſs globe be filled with oil and water, and whirled upon its axis, the centrifugal power will carry the heavier fluid to the circumference, and the lighter will in conſequence be found round the axis. 3. There may be a place at ſome certain latitude between the poles and the line on each ſide the equator, where the inflammable ſupernatant atmoſphere may end, owing to the greater centrifugal force of the heavier aerial atmoſphere. 4. Between the termination of the aerial and the beginning of the gaſſeous atmoſphere, the airs will occaſionally be intermixed, and thus become inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable by the electric ſpark; theſe circumſtances will aſſiſt in explaining the phenomena of fire-balls, northern lights, and of ſome variable winds, and long continued rains.</p>
                              <p>Since the above note was firſt written, Mr. Volta I am informed has applied the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a ſupernatant atmoſphere of inflammable air, to explain ſome phenomena in meteorology.

The crepuſcular atmoſphere, or the region where the light of the ſun ceaſes to be refracted to us, is eſtimated by philoſophers to be between 40 and 50 miles high, at which time the ſun is about 18 degrees below the horizon; and the rarity of the air is ſuppoſed to be from 4,000 to 10,000 times greater than at the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth. Cotes's Hydroſt. p. 123. The duration of twilight differs in different ſeaſons and in different latitudes; in England the ſhorteſt twilight is about the beginning of October and of March; in more northern latitudes, where the ſun never finks more than 18 degrees, below the horizon, the twilight continues the whole night. The time of its duration may alſo be occaſionally affected by the varying height of the atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere. A number of obſervations on the duration of twilight in different latitudes might afford conſiderable information concerning the aerial ſtrata in the higher regions of the atmoſphere, and might aſſiſt in determining whether an exterior atmoſphere of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable gas, or Hydrogene, exiſts over the aerial one.</p>

                                 <hi>Hurl innocuous embers.</hi> l. 152. The immediate cauſe of volcanic eruptions is believed to be owing to the water of the ſea, or from lakes, or inundations, finding itſelf a paſſage into the ſubterraneous fires, which may lie at great depths. This muſt firſt produce by its coldneſs a condenſation of the vapour there exiſting, or a vacuum, and thus occaſion parts of the earth's cruſt or ſhell to be forced down by the preſſure of the incumbent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere. Afterwards the water being ſuddenly raiſed into ſteam produces all the exploſive effects of earthquakes. And by new acceſſions of water during the intervals of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſions the repetition of the ſhocks is cauſed. Theſe circumſtances were hourly illuſtrated by the fountains of boiling water in Iceland, in which the ſurface of the water in the boiling wells ſunk down low before every new ebullition.</p>
                              <p>Beſides theſe eruptions occaſioned by the ſteam of water, there ſeems to be a perpetual effuſion of other vapours, more noxious and (as far as it is yet known) perhaps greatly more expanſile than water from the Volcanos in various parts of the world. As theſe Volcanos are ſuppoſed to be ſpiracula or breathing holes to the great ſubterraneous fires, it is probable that the eſcape of elaſtic vapours from them is the cauſe, that the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes of modern days are of ſuch ſmall extent compared to thoſe of antient times, of which veſtiges remain in every part of the world, and on this account may be ſaid not only to be innocuous, but uſeful.</p>

The air, like all other bad conductors of electricity, is known to be a bad conductor of heat; and thence prevents the heat acquired from the ſun's rays by the earth's ſurface from being ſo ſoon diſſipated, in the ſame manner as a blanket, which may be conſidered as a ſponge filled with air, prevents the eſcape of heat from the perſon wrapped in it. This ſeems to be one cauſe of the great degree of cold on the tops of mountains, where the rarity of the air is greater, and it therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a better conductor both of heat and electricity. See note on Barometz, Vol. II. of this work.</p>
                              <p>There is however another cauſe to which the great coldneſs of mountains and of the higher regions of the atmoſphere is more immediately to be aſcribed, explained by Dr. Darwin in the Philos. Tranſ. Vol. LXXVIII. who has there proved by experiments with the air-gun and air-pump, that when any portion of the atmoſphere becomes mechanically expanded, it abſorbs heat from the bodies in its vicinity. And as the air which creeps along the plains, expands itſelf by a part of the preſſure being taken off when it aſcends the ſides of mountains; it at the ſame time attracts heat from the ſummits of thoſe mountains, or other bodies which happen to be immerſed in it, and thus produces cold. Hence he concludes that the hot air at the bottom of the Andes becomes temperate by its own rarefaction when it aſcents to the city of Quito; and by its further rarefaction becomes cooled to the freezing point when it aſcends to the ſnowy regions on the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of thoſe mountains. To this alſo he attributes the great degree of cold experienced by the aeronauts in their balloons; and which produces hail in ſummer at the height of only two or three miles in the atmoſphere.</p>

I have often been induced to believe from obſervation, that the twilight of the evenings is lighter than that of the mornings at the ſame diſtance from noon. Some may aſcribe this to the greater height of the atmoſphere in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings having been rarefied by the ſun during the day; but as its denſity muſt at the ſame time be diminiſhed, its power of refraction would continue the ſame. I ſhould rather ſuppoſe that it may be owing to the phoſphoreſcent quality (as it is called) of almoſt all bodies; that is, when they have been expoſed to the ſun they continue to emit light for a conſiderable time afterwards. This is generally believed to ariſe either from ſuch bodies giving out the light which they had previouſly abſorbed; or to the continuance of a ſlow combuſtion which the light they had been previouſly expoſed to had excited.

                                 <hi>Beccari's ſhells, l.</hi> 182. Beccari made made many curious experiments on the phoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoric light, as it is called, which becomes viſible on bodies brought into a dark room, after having been previouſly expoſed to the ſunſhine. It appears from theſe experiments, that almoſt all inflammable bodies poſſeſs this quality in a greater or leſs degree; white paper or linen thus examined after having been expoſed to the ſunſhine, is luminous to an extraordinary degree; and if a perſon ſhut up in a dark room, puts one of his hands out into the ſun's light for a ſhort time and then retracts it, he will be able to ſee that hand diſtinctly, and not the other. Theſe experiments ſeem to countenance the idea of light being abſorbed and again emitted from bodies when they are removed into darkneſs. But Beccari further pretended, that ſome calcareous compoſitions when expoſed to red, yellow, or blue light, through coloured glaſſes, would on their being brought into a dark room emit coloured lights. This miſtaken fact of Beccari's, Mr. Wilſon decidedly refutes; and among many other curious experiments diſcovered, that if oyſter-ſhells were thrown into a common fire and calcined for about half an hour, and then brought to a perſon who had previouſly been ſome minutes in a dark room, that many of them would exhibit beautiful iriſes of priſmatic colours, from whence probably aroſe Beccari's miſtake. Mr. Wilſon from hence contends, that theſe kinds of phoſphori do not emit the light they had previouſly received, but that they are ſet on fire by the ſun's rays, and continue for ſome time a ſlow combuſtion after they are withdrawn from the light.

                              <p>The Bolognian ſtone is a ſelenite, or gypſum, and has been long celebrated for its phoſphoreſcent quality after having been burnt in a ſulphurous fire; and expoſed when cold to the ſun's light. It may be thus well imitated: Calcine oyſter-ſhells half an hour, pulverize them when cold, and add one third part of flowers of ſulphur, preſs them cloſe into a ſmall crucible, and calcine them for an hour or longer, and keep the powder in a phial cloſe ſtopped. A part of this powder is to be expoſed for a minute or two to the ſunbeams, and then brought into a dark room. The calcined Bolognian ſtone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a calcareous hepar of ſulphur; but the calcined ſhells, as they contain the animal acid, may alſo contain ſome of the phoſphorus of Kunkel.</p>

The ignis fatuus or Jack a lantern, ſo frequently alluded to by poets, is ſuppoſed to originate from the inflammable air, or Hydrogene, given up from moraſſes; which being of a heavier kind from its impurity than that obtained from iron and water, hovers near the ſurface of the earth, and uniting with common air gives out light by its ſlow ignition. Perhaps ſuch lights have no exiſtence, and the reflection of a ſtar on watery ground may have deceived the travellers, who have been ſaid to be bewildered by them? if the fact was eſtabliſhed it would much contribute to explain the phenomena of northern lights.

                                 <hi>The dread Gymnotus.</hi> l. 202. The Gymnotus electricus is a native of the river of
Surinam in South America; thoſe which were brought over to England about eight years
ago were about three or four feet long, and gave an electric ſhock (as I experienced) by
putting one finger on the back near its head, and another of the oppoſite hand into the
water near its tail. In their native country they are ſaid to exceed twenty feet in length,
and kill any man who approaches them in an hoſtile manner. It is not only to eſcape its
enemies that this ſurprizing power of the fiſh is uſed, but alſo to take its prey; which
it does by benumbing them and then devouring them before they have time to recover,
or by perfectly killing them; for the quantity of the power ſeemed to be determined by
the will or anger of the animal; as it ſometimes ſtruck a fiſh twice before it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
benumbed to be eaſily ſwallowed.</p>
                              <p>The organs productive of this wonderful accumulation of electric matter have been
accurately diſſected and deſcribed by Mr. J. Hunter. Philoſ. Tranſ. Vol. LXV. And
are ſo divided by membranes as to compoſe a very extenſive ſurface, and are ſupplied
with many pairs of nerves larger than any other nerves of the body; but how ſo large a
quantity is ſo quickly accumulated as to produce ſuch amazing effects in a fluid ill adapted
for the purpoſe is not yet ſatiſfactorily explained. The Torpedo poſſeſſes a ſimilar power
in a leſs degree, as was ſhewn by Mr. Walch, and another fiſh lately deſcribed by Mr.
Paterſon. Philo. Tranſ. Vol. LXXVI.</p>
                              <p>In the conſtruction of the Leyden-Phial, (as it is called) which is coated on both
ſides, it is known, that above one hundred times the quantity of poſitive electricity can
be condenſed on every ſquare inch of the coating on one ſide, than could have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated
on the ſame ſurface if there had been no oppoſite coating communicating
with the earth; becauſe the negative electricity, or that part of it which cauſed its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion,
is now drawn off through the glaſs. It is alſo well known, that the thinner
the glaſs is (which is thus coated on both ſides ſo as to make a Leyden-phial, or plate)
the more electricity can be condenſed on one of its ſurfaces, till it becomes ſo thin as to
break, and thence diſcharge itſelf.</p>
                              <p>Now it is poſſible, that the quantity of electricity condenſible on one ſide of a coated
phial may increaſe in ſome high ratio in reſpect to the thinneſs of the glaſs, ſince the
power of attraction is known to decreaſe as the ſquares of the diſtances, to which this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of electricity ſeems to bear ſome analogy. Hence if an animal membrane, as
thin as the ſilk-worm ſpins its ſilk, could be ſo ſituated as to be charged like the Leyden
bottle, without burſting, (as ſuch thin glaſs would be liable to do,) it would be difficult
to calculate the immenſe quantity of electric fluid, which might be accumulated on its
ſurface. No land animals are yet diſcovered which poſſeſs this power, though the air
would have been a much better medium for producing its effects; perhaps the ſize of the
neceſſary apparatus would have been inconvenient to land animals.</p>

For many ages it is probable fire was eſteemed a dangerous enemy, known only by its dreadful devaſtations; and that many lives muſt have been loſt, and many dangerous burns and wounds muſt have afflicted thoſe who firſt dared to ſubject it to the uſes of life. It is ſaid that the tall monkies of Borneo and Sumatra lie down with pleaſure ruond any accidental fire in their woods; and are arrived to that degree of reaſon, that knowledge of cauſation, that they thruſt into the remaining fire the half-burnt ends of the branches to prevent its going out. One of the nobles of the cultivated people of Otaheita, when Captain Cook treated them with tea, catched the boiling water in his hand from the cock of the tea-urn, and bellowed with pain, not conceiving that water could become hot, like red fire.</p>
                                 <p>Tools of ſteel conſtitute another important diſcovery in conſequence of fire; and contributed perhaps principally to give the European nations ſo great ſuperiority over the American world. By theſe two agents, fire and tools of ſteel, mankind became able to cope with the vegetable kingdom, and conquer provinces of foreſts, which in uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated countries almoſt exclude the growth of other vegetables, and of thoſe animals which are neceſſary to our exiſtence. Add to this, that the quantity of our food is alſo increaſed by the uſe of fire, for ſome vegetables become ſalutary food by means of the heat uſed in cookery, which are naturally either noxious or difficult of digeſtion; as potatoes, kidney-beans, onions, cabbages. The caſſava when made into bread, is perhaps rendered mild by the heat it undergoes, more than by expreſſing its ſuperfluous juice. The roots of white bryony and of arum, I am informed loſe much of their acrimony by boiling.</p>

The phenomena of chemical exploſions cannot be accounted for without the ſuppoſition, that ſome of the bodies employed contain concentrated or ſolid heat combined with them, to which the French Chemiſts have given the name of Calorique. When air is expanded in the air-pump, or water evaporated into ſteam, they drink up or abſorb a great quantity of heat; from this analogy, when gunpowder is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded it ought to abſorb much heat, that is, in popular language, it ought to produce a great quantity of cold. When vital air is united with phlogiſtic matter in reſpiration, which ſeems to be a ſlow combuſtion, its volume is leſſened; the carbonic acid, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps phoſphoric acid are produced; and heat is given out; which according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of Dr. Crawford would ſeem to be depoſited from the vital air. But as the vital air in nitrous acid is condenſed from a light elaſtic gas to that of a heavy fluid, it muſt poſſeſs leſs heat than before. And hence a great part of the heat, which is given out in firing gunpowder, I ſhould ſuppoſe, muſt reſide in the ſulphur or charcoal.</p>
                                 <p>Mr. Lavoiſier has ſhewn, that vital air, or Oxygene, looſes leſs of its heat when it becomes one of the component parts of nitrous acid, than in any other of its combinations; and is hence capable of giving out a great quantity of heat in the exploſion of gunpowder; but as there ſeems to be great analogy between the matter of heat, or Calorique, and the electric matter; and as the worſt conductors of electricity are believed to contain the greateſt quantity of that fluid; there is reaſon to ſuſpect that the worſt conductors of heat may contain the moſt of that fluid; as ſulphur, wax, ſilk, air, glaſs.

When flints are ſtruck againſt other flints they have the property of giving ſparks of light; but it it ſeems to be an internal light, perhaps of electric origin, very different from the ignited ſparks which are ſtruck from flint and ſteel. The ſparks produced by the colliſion of ſteel with flint appear to be globular particles of iron, which have been fuſed, and imperfectly ſcorified or vitrified. They are kindled by the heat produced by the colliſion; but their vivid light, and their fuſion and vitrification are the effects of a combuſtion continued in theſe particles during their paſſage through the air. This opinion is confirmed by an experiment of Mr. Hawkſbee, who found that theſe ſparks could not be produced in the exhauſted receiver. See Keir's Chemical Dict. art. Iron, and art. Earth vitrifiable.</p>

                                    <hi>And cloſe an airy ocean.</hi> l. 242. Gunpowder is plainly deſcribed in the works of Roger Bacon before the year 1267. He deſcribes it in a curious manner, mentioning the ſulphur and nitre, but conceals the charcoal in an anagram. The words are, ſed tamen ſalis petrae <hi>lure mope can ubre,</hi> et ſulphuris; et ſic facies tonitrum, et corruſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem, ſi ſcias, artificium. The words lure mope can ubre are an anagram of carbonum pulvere. Biograph. Britan. Vol. I. Bacon de Secretis Operibus, Cap. XI. He adds, that he thinks by an artifice of this kind Gideon defeated the Midianites with only three hundred men. Judges, Chap. VII. Chamb. Dict. art. Gunpowder. As Bacon does not claim this as his own invention, it is thought by many to have been of much more antient diſcovery.</p>
                                 <p>The permanently elaſtic fluid generated in the firing of gunpowder is calculated by Mr. Robins to be about 244 if the bulk of the powder be I. And that the heat gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated at the time of the exploſion occaſions the rarefied air thus produced to occupy about 1000 times the ſpace of the gunpowder. This preſſure may therefore be called equal to 1000 atmoſpheres or ſix tons upon a ſquare inch. As the ſuddenneſs of this exploſion muſt contribute much to its power, it would ſeem that the chamber of powder, to produce its greateſt effect, ſhould be lighted in the centre of it; which I believe is not attended to in the manufacture of muſkets or piſtols.</p>
                                 <p>From the cheapneſs with which a very powerful gunpowder is likely ſoon to be manufactured from aerated marine acid, or from a new method of forming nitrous acid by means of mangoneſe or other calciform ores, it may probably in time be applied to move machinery, and ſuperſede the uſe of ſteam.</p>
                                 <p>There is a bitter invective in Don Quixot againſt the inventors of gun-powder, as it levels the ſtrong with the weak, the knight caſed in ſteel with the naked ſhepherd, thoſe who have been trained to the ſword, with thoſe who are totally unſkilful in the uſe of it; and throws down all the ſplendid diſtinctions of mankind. Theſe very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought to have been urged to ſhew that the diſcovery of gunpowder has been of public utiliy by weakening the tyranny of the few over the many.</p>

                                 <hi>Delighted Savery.</hi> l. 254. The invention of the ſteam-engine for raiſing water by the preſſure of the air in conſequence of the condenſation of ſteam, is properly aſcribed to Capt. Savery; a plate and deſcription of this machine is given in Harris's Lexicon Technicum, art. Engine. Though the Marquis of Worceſter in his Century of Inventions printed in the year 1663 had deſcribed an engine for raiſing water by the exploſive power of ſteam long before Savery's. Mr. Deſegulier affirms, that Savery bought up all he could procure of the books of the Marquis of Worceſter, and deſtroyed them, profeſſing himſelf then to have diſcovered the power of ſteam by accident, which ſeems to have been an unfounded ſlander. Savery applied it to the raiſing of water to ſupply houſes and gardens, but could not accompliſh the draining of mines by it. Which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards done by Mr. Newcomen and Mr. John Cowley at Dartmouth, in the year 1712, who added the piſton.</p>
                              <p>A few years ago Mr. Watt of Glaſgow much improved this machine, and with Mr. Boulton of Birmingham has applied it to variety of purpoſes, ſuch as raiſing water from mines, blowing bellows to fuſe the ore, ſupplying towns with water, grinding corn and many other purpoſes. There is reaſon to believe it may in time be applied to the row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of barges, and the moving of carriages along the road. As the ſpecific levity of air is too great for the ſupport of great burthens by balloons, there ſeems no probable method of flying conveniently but by the power of ſteam, or ſome other exploſive material; which another half century may probable diſcover.

The benevolence of the great Author of all things is greatly manifeſt in the ſum of his works, as Dr. Balguy has well evinced in his pamphlet on Divine Benevolence aſſerted, printed for Davis, 1781. Yet if we may compare the parts of nature with each other, there are ſome circumſtances of her economy which ſeem to contribute more to the general ſcale of happineſs than others. Thus the nouriſhment of animal bodies is derived from three ſources: 1. the milk given from the mother to the offſpring; in this excellent contrivance the mother has pleaſure in affording the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the child, and the child has pleaſure in receiving it. 2. Another ſource of the food of animals includes ſeeds or eggs; in theſe the embryon is in a torpid or inſenſible ſtate, and there is along with it laid up for its early nouriſhment a ſtore of proviſion, as the fruit belonging to ſome ſeeds, and the oil and ſtarch belonging to others; when theſe are conſumed by animals the unfeeling ſeed or egg receives no pain, but the animal receives pleaſure which conſumes it. Under this article may be included the bodies of animals which die naturally. 3. But the laſt method of ſupporting animal bodies by the deſtruction of other living animals, as lions preying upon lambs, theſe upon living vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, and mankind upon them all, would appear to be a leſs perfect part of the economy of nature than thoſe before mentioned, as contributing leſs to the ſum of general happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                                 <hi>So mighty Hercules.</hi> l. 297. The ſtory of Hercules ſeems of great antiquity, as appears from the ſimplicity of his dreſs and armour, a lion's ſkin and a club; and from the nature of many of his exploits, the deſtruction of wild beaſts and robbers. This part of the hiſtory of Hercules ſeems to have related to times before the invention of the bow and arrow, or of ſpinning flax. Other ſtories of Hercules are perhaps of later date, and appear to be allegorical, as his conquering the river-god Achilous, and bringing Cerberus up to day light; the former might refer to his turning the courſe of a river, and draining a moraſs, and the latter to his expoſing a part of the ſuperſtition of the times. The ſtrangling the lion and tearing his jaws aſunder, are deſcribed from a ſtatue in the Muſeum Florentinum, and from an antique gem; and the graſping Anteus to death in his arms as he lifts him from the earth, is deſcribed from another antient cameo. The famous pillars of Hercules have been variouſly explained. Pliny aſſerts that the natives of Spain and of Africa believed that the mountains of Abyla and Calpè on each ſide of the ſtraits of Gibraltar were the pillars of Hercules; and that they were reared by the hands of that god, and the ſea admitted between them. Plin. Hiſt. Nat. p. 46. Edit. Manut. Venet. 1609.</p>
                              <p>If the paſſage between the two continents was opened by an earthquake in antient times, as this allegorical ſtory would ſeem to countenance, there muſt have been an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe current of water at firſt run into the Mediterranean from the Atlantic; ſince there is at preſent a ſtrong ſtream ſets always from thence into the Mediterranean. Whatever may be the cauſe, which now conſtantly operates, ſo as to make the ſurface of the Mediterranean lower than that of the Atlantic, it muſt have kept it very much lower before a paſſage for the water through the ſtreights was opened. It is probable before ſuch an event took place, the coaſts and iſlands of the Mediterranean extended much further into that ſea, and were then for a great extent of country, deſtroyed by the floods occaſioned by the new riſe of water, and have ſince remained beneath the ſea. Might not this give riſe to the flood of Deucalion? See note Caſſia, V. II. of this work.</p>

Dr. Franklin's idea of the pores of the glaſs being opened by the friction, and thence rendered capable of attracting more electric fluid, which it again parts with, as the pores contract again, feems analogous in ſome meaſure to the heat produced by the vibration, or condenſation of bodies, as when a nail is hammered or filed till it becomes hot, as mentioned in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Notes, No. VII. Some philoſophers have endeavoured to account for this phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon by ſuppoſing the exiſtence of two electric fluids which may be called the vitreous and reſinous ones, inſtead of the plus and minus of the ſame ether, But its accumulation on the rubbed glaſs bears great analogy to its accumulation on the ſurface of the Leyden bottle, and can not perhaps be explained from any known mechanical or chemical principle.

I believe it is not known with certainty at what time the painters firſt introduced the luminous circle round the head to import a Saint or holy perſon. It is now become a part of the ſymbolic language of painting, and it is much to be wiſhed that this kind of hieroglyphic character was more frequent in that art; as it is much wanted to render hiſtoric pictures both more intelligible, and more ſublime; and why ſhould not painting as well as poetry expreſs itſelf in metaphor, or in indiſtinct alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory? A truly great modern painter lately endeavoured to enlarge the ſphere of pictorial language, by putting a demon behind the pillow of a wicked man on his death bed. Which unfortunately for the ſcientific part of painting, the cold criticiſm of the preſent day has depreciated; and thus barred perhaps the only road to the further improvement in this ſcience.</p>

There is probably a ſyſtem of nerves in animal bodies for the purpoſe of perceiving heat; ſince the degree of this fluid is ſo neceſſary to health that we become preſently injured either by its acceſs or defect; and becauſe almoſt every part of our bodies is ſupplied with branches from different pairs of nerves, which would not ſeem neceſſary for their motion alone. It is therefore probable, that our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of electricity is only of its violence in paſſing through our ſyſtem by its ſuddenly diſtending the muſcles, like any other mechanical violence; and that it is general pain alone that we feel, and not any ſenſation analogous to the ſpecific quality of the object. Nature may ſeem to have been niggardly to mankind in beſtowing upon them ſo few ſenſes; ſince a ſenſe to have perceived electricity, and another to have perceived mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm might have been of great ſervice to them, many ages before theſe fluids were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by accidental experiment, but it is poſſible an increaſed number of ſenſes might have incommoded us by adding to the ſize of our bodies.</p>

Paralytic limbs are in general only incapable of being ſtimulated into action by the power of the will; ſince the pulſe continues to beat and the fluids to be abſorbed in them; and it commonly happens, when paralytic people yawn and ſtretch themſelves, (which is not a voluntary motion,) that the affected limb moves at the ſame time. The temporary motion of a paralytic limb is likewiſe cauſed by paſſing the electric ſhock through it; which would ſeem to indicate ſome analogy between the electric fluid, and the nervous fluid, which is ſeperated from the blood by the brain, and and thence diffuſed along the nerves for the purpoſes of motion and ſenſation. It probably deſtroys life by its ſudden expanſion of the nerves or fibres of the brain; in the ſame manner as it fuſes metals and ſplinters wood or ſtone, and removes the atmoſphere, when it paſſes from one object to another in a denſe ſtate.</p>

                                    <hi>You led your Franklin.</hi> l. 383. Dr. Franklin was the firſt that diſcovered that lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiſted of electric matter, he elevated a tall rod with a wire wrapped round it, and fixing the bottom of a rod into a glaſs bottle, and preſerving it from falling by means of ſilk-ſtrings, he found it electrified whenever a cloud paſſed over it, receiving ſparks by his finger from it, and charging coated phials. This great diſcovery taught us to defend houſes and ſhips and temples from lightning, and alſo to underſtand, <hi>that people are always perfectly ſafe in a room during a thunder ſtorm if they keep themſelves at three or four feet diſtance from the walls;</hi> for the matter of lightning in paſſing from the clouds to the earth, or from the earth to the clouds, runs through the walls of a houſe, the trunk of a tree, or other elevated object; except there be ſome moiſter body, as an animal in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact with them, or nearly ſo; and in that caſe the lightning leaves the wall or tree, and paſſes through the animal; but as it can paſs through metals with ſtill greater facility, it will leave animal bodies to paſs through metallic ones.</p>
                                 <p>If a perſon in the open air be ſurprized by a thunderſtorm, he will know his danger by obſerving on a ſecond watch the time which paſſes between the flaſh and the crack, and reckoning a mile for every four ſeconds and a half, and a little more. For ſound travels at the rate of 1142 feet in a ſecond of time, and the velocity of light through ſuch ſmall diſtances is not to be eſtimated. In theſe circumſtances a perſon will be ſafer by lying down on the ground, than erect, and ſtill ſafer if within a few feet of his horſe; which being then a more elevated animal will receive the ſhock in preference as the cloud paſſes over.

                                 <hi>Tranſient heat diſpart.</hi> l. 401. Dr. Crawford in his ingenious work on animal heat has endeavoured to prove, that during the combination of the pure part of the atmoſphere with the phlogiſtic part of the blood, that much of the matter of the heat is given out from the air; and that this is the great and perpetual ſource of the heat of animals; to which we may add that the phoſphoric acid is probably produced by this combination; by which acid the colour of the blood is changed in the lungs from a deep crimſon to a bright ſcarlet. There ſeems to be however another ſource of animal heat, though of a ſimilar nature; and that is from the chemical combinations produced in all the glands; ſince by whatever cauſe any glandular ſecretion is increaſed, as by friction or topical imflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the heat of that part becomes increaſed at the ſame time; thus after the hands have been for a time immerſed in ſnow, on coming into a warm room, they become red and hot, without any increaſed pulmonary action. BESIDES THIS there would ſeem to be another material received from the air by reſpiration; which is ſo neceſſary to life, that the embryon muſt learn to breath almoſt within a minute after its birth, or it dies. The perpetual neceſſity of breathing ſhews, that the material thus acquired is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually conſuming or eſcaping, and on that account requires perpetual renovation. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the ſpirit of animation itſelf is thus acquired from the atmoſphere, which if it be ſuppoſed to be finer or more ſubtle than the electric matter, could not long be retained in our bodies, and muſt therefore require perpetual renovation.</p>

                                 <hi>Thus when the egg of Night.</hi> l. 413. There were two Cupids belonging to the antient mythology, one much elder than the other. The elder cupid, or Eros, or divine Love, was the firſt that came out of the great egg of night, wich floated in Chaos, and was broken by the horns of the celeſtial bull, that is, was hatched by the warmth of the ſpring. He was winged and armed, and by his arrows and torch pierced and vivified all things, producing life and joy. Bacon, Vol. V. p. 197. Quarto edit. Lond. 1778. <q>At this time, (ſays Ariſtophanes,) ſable-winged night produced an egg, from whence ſprung up like a bloſſom Eros, the lovely, the deſirable, with his gloſſy golden wings.</q> Avibus. Bryant's Mythology, Vol. II. p. 350. ſecond edition. This intereſting moment of this ſublime allegory Mrs. Coſway has choſen for her very beautiful painting. She has repreſented Eros or divine Love with large wings having the ſtrength of the eagle's wings, and the ſplendor of the peacocks, with his hair floating in the form of flame, and with a halo of light vapour round his head; which illuminates the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; while he is in the act of ſpringing forwards, and with his hands ſeparating the elements.</p>

                                 <hi>Of the Weſtern Wind.</hi> l. 430. The principal froſts of this country are accompanied or produced by a N.E. wind, and the thaws by a S. W. wind; the reaſon of which is that the N.E. winds conſiſt of regions of air brought from the north, which appear to acquire an eaſterly direction as they advance; and the S. W. winds conſiſt of regions of air brought from the ſouth, which appear to acquire a weſterly direction as they advance. The ſurface of the earth nearer the pole moves ſlower than it does in our latitude; whence the regions of air brought from thence, move ſlower, when they arrive hither, than the earth's ſurface with which they now become in contact; that is they acquire an apparent eaſterly direction, as the earth moves from weſt to eaſt faſter than this new part of its atmoſphere. The S. W. winds on the contrary conſiſt of regions of air brought from the ſouth, where the ſurface of the earth moves faſter than in our latitude; and have therefore a weſterly direction when they arrive hither by their moving faſter than the ſurface of the earth, with which they are in contact; and in general the nearer to the weſt and the greater the velocity of theſe winds the warmer they ſhould be in reſpect to the ſeaſon of the year, ſince they have been brought more expeditiouſly from the South, than thoſe winds which have leſs weſterly direction, and have thence been leſs cooled in their paſſage.</p>
                              <p>Sometimes I have obſerved the thaw to commence immediately on the change of the wind, even within an hour, is I am not miſtaken, or ſooner. At other times the S.W. wind has continued a day, or even two, before the thaw has commenced; during which time ſome of the froſty air, which had gone ſouthwards, is driven back over us; and in confequence has taken a weſterly direction, as well as a ſouthern one. At other times I have obſerved a froſt with a N.E. wind every morning, and a thaw with a S.W. wind every noon for ſeveral days together. Sec additional note, XXXIII.</p>

                                 <hi>The Fiend of Froſt.</hi> l. 439. The principal injury done to vegetation by froſt is from the expanſion of the water contained in the veſſels of plants. Water converted into ice occupies a greater ſpace than it did before, as appears by the burſting of bottles filled with water at the time of their freezing. Hence froſt deſtroys thoſe plants of our iſland firſt, which are moſt ſucculent; and the moſt ſucculent parts firſt of other plants; as their leaves and laſt year's ſhoots; the veſſels of which are diſtended and burſt by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of their freezing fluids, while the drier or more reſinous plants, as pines, yews, laurels, and other ever-greens, are leſs liable to injury from cold. The trees in vallies are on this account more injured by the vernal froſts than thoſe on eminencies, becauſe their early ſucculent ſhoots come out ſooner. Hence fruit trees covered by a ſix-inch coping of a wall are leſs injured by the vernal froſts becauſe their being ſhielded from ſhowers and the deſcending night-dews has prevented them from being moiſt at the time of their being frozen: which circumſtance has given occaſion to a vulgar error amongſt gardeners, who ſuppoſe froſt to deſcend.</p>
                              <p>As the common heat of the earth in this climate is 48 degrees, thoſe tender trees which will bear bending down, are eaſily ſecured from the froſt by ſpreading them upon the ground, and covering them with ſtraw or fern. This particularly ſuits fig-trees, as they eaſily bear bending to the ground, and are furniſhed with an acrid juice, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures them from the depredations of inſects; but are nevertheleſs liable to be eaten by mice.

                              <p>The buds of trees are of two kinds, either flower-buds or leaf buds; the former of theſe produce their ſeeds and die; the latter produce other leaf buds or flower buds and die. So that all the buds of trees may be conſidered as annual plants, having their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryon produced during the preceeding ſummer. The ſame ſeems to happen with reſpect to bulbs; thus a tulip produces annually one flower-bearing bulb, ſometimes two, and ſeveral leaf-bearing bulbs; and then the old root periſhes. Next year the flower-bearing bulb produces ſeeds and other bulbs and periſhes; while the leaf-bearing bulb, producing other bulbs only, periſhes likewiſe; theſe circumſtances eſtabliſh a ſtrict analogy between bulbs and buds.

The fluid matter of heat, or Calorique, in which all bodies are immerſed, is as neceſſary to vegetable as to animal exiſtence. It is not yet determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able whether heat and light be different materials, or modifications of the ſame materials, as they have ſome properties in common. They appear to be both of them equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to vegetable health, ſince without light green vegetables become firſt yellow, that is, they loſe the blue colour, which contributed to produce the green; and afterwards they alſo loſe the yellow and become white; as is ſeen in cellery blanched or etiolated for the table by excluding the light from it.</p>
                              <p>The upper ſurface of leaves, which I ſuppoſe to be their organ of reſpiration, ſeems to require light as well as air; ſince plants which grow in windows on the inſide of houſes are equally ſollicitous to turn the upper ſide of their leaves to the light. Vegetables at the ſame time exſude or perſpire a great quantity from their leaves, as animals do from their lungs; this perſpirable matter as it riſes from their fine veſſels, (perhaps much finer than the pores of animal ſkins,) is divided into inconcievable tenuity; and when acted upon by the Sun's light appears to be decompoſed; the hydrogene becomes a part of the vegetable, compoſing oils or reſins; and the Oxygene combined with light or calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique aſcends, producing the pure part of the atmoſphere or vital air. Hence during the light of the day vegetables give up more pure air than their reſpiration injures; but not ſo in the night, even though equally expoſed to warmth. This ſingle fact would ſeem to ſhew, that light is eſſentially different from heat; and it is perhaps by its combination with bodies, that their combined or latent heat is ſet at liberty, and becomes ſenſible.

The influence of electricity in forwarding the germination of plants and their growth ſeems to be pretty well eſtabliſhed; though Mr. Ingenhouz did not ſucceed in his experiments, and thence doubts the ſucceſs of thoſe of others. And though M. Rouland from his new experiments believes, that neither poſitive nor nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive electricity increaſes vegetation; both which philoſophers had previouſly been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the contrary doctrine; for many other naturaliſts have ſince repeated their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments relative to this object, and their new reſults have confirmed their former ones. Mr. D'Ormoy and the two Roziers have found the ſame ſucceſs in numerous experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they have made in the laſt two years; and Mr. Carmoy has ſhewn in a convincing manner that electricity accelerates germination.</p>
                              <p>Mr. D'Ormoy not only found various ſeeds to vegetate ſooner, and to grow taller which were put upon his inſulated table and ſupplied with electricity, but alſo that ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms began to ſpin much ſooner which were kept electrified than thoſe of the ſame hatch which were kept in the ſame place and manner, except that they were not elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified.

                              <p>M. Bartholon, who had before written a tract on this ſubject, and propoſed ingenious methods for applying electricity to agriculture and gardening, has alſo repeated a numerous ſet of experiments; and ſhews both that natural electricity, as well as the artificial, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the growth of plants, and the germination of ſeeds; and oppoſes Mr. Ingenhouz by very numerous and concluſive facts.

                              <p>Since by the late diſcoveries or opinions of the Chemiſts there is reaſon to believe that water is decompoſed in the veſſels of vegetables; and that the Hydrogene or inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable air, of which it in part conſiſts, contributes to the nouriſhment of the plant, and to the production of its oils, roſins, gums, ſugar, &amp;c. and laſtly as electricity decompoſes water into theſe two airs termed Oxygene and Hydrogene, there is a powerful analogy to induce us to believe that it accelerates or contributes to the growth of vegetation, and like heat may poſſibly enter into combination with many bodies, or form the baſis of ſome yet unanaliſed acid.</p>

The ſympathetic inks made by Zaffre diſſolved in the marine and nitrous acids have this curious property, that being brought to the fire one of them becomes green, and the other red; but what is more wonderful, they again loſe theſe colours, (unleſs the heat has been too great,) on their being again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the fire. Fire-ſcreens have been thus painted, which in the cold have ſhewn only the trunk and branches of a dead tree, and ſandy hills, which on their approach to the fire have put forth green leaves and red flowers, and graſs upon the mountains. The proceſs of making theſe inks is very eaſy, take Zaffre, as ſold by the druggiſts, and digeſt it in aqua regia, and the calx of Cobalt will be diſſolved; which ſolution muſt be diluted with a little common water to prevent it from making too ſtrong an impreſſion on the paper; the colour when the paper is heated becomes of a fine green-blue. If Zaffre or Regulus of Cobalt be diſſolved in the ſame manner in ſpirit of nitre, or aqua fortis, a reddiſh colour is produced on expoſing the paper to heat. Chemical Dictionary by Mr. Keir, Art.

There are many reaſons to believe from the accounts of travellers and navigators, that the iſlands of ice in the higher northern latitudes as well as the Glaciers on the Alps continue perpetually to increaſe in bulk. At certain times in the ice-mountains of Switzerland there happen cracks which have ſhewn the great thickneſs of the ice, as ſome of theſe cracks have meaſured three or four hundred ells deep. The great iſlands of ice in the northern ſeas near Hudſon's bay have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have been immerſed above one hundred fathoms beneath the ſurface of the ſea, and to have riſen a fifth or ſixth part above the ſurface, and to have meaſured between three and four miles in circumference. Phil. Trans. No. 465. Sect. 2.</p>
                              <p>Dr. Liſter endeavoured to ſhew that the ice of ſea-water contains ſome ſalt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps leſs air than common ice, and that it is therefore much more difficult of ſolution; whence he accounts for the perpetual and great increaſe of theſe floating iſlands of ice. Philos. Trans. No. 169.</p>
                              <p>As by a famous experiment of Mr. Boyles it appears that ice evaporates very faſt in ſevere froſty weather when the wind blows upon it; and as ice in a thawing ſtate is known to contain ſix times more cold than water at the ſame degree of ſenſible coldneſs, it is eaſy to underſtand that winds blowing over iſlands and continents of ice perhaps much below nothing on Farenheit's ſcale, and coming from thence into our latitude muſt bring great degrees of cold along with them. If we add to this the quantity of cold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the evaporation of the water as well as by the ſolution of the ice, we cannot doubt but that the northern ice is the principle ſource of the coldneſs of our winters, and that it is brought hither by the regions of air blowing from the north, and which take an apparent eaſterly direction by their coming to a part of the ſurface of the earth which moves faſter than the latitude they come from. Hence the increaſe of the ice in the polar regions by increaſing the cold of our climate adds at the ſame time to the bulk of the Glaciers of Italy and Switzerland.</p>
                              <p>If the nations who inhabit this hemiſphere of the globe, inſtead of deſtroying their ſea-men and exhauſting their wealth in unneceſſary wars, could be induced to unite their labours to navigate theſe immenſe maſſes of ice into the more ſouthern oceans, two great advantages would reſult to mankind, the tropic countries would be much cooled by their ſolution, and our winters in this latitude would be rendered much milder for perhaps a century or two, till the maſſes of ice became again enormous.</p>

                              <p>We have lately experienced an inſtance of ice-iſlands brought from the Southern polar regions, on which the Guardian ſtruck at the beginning of her paſſage from the Cape of Good Hope towards Botany Bay, on December 22, 1789.

The ſolution of water in air or in calorique, ſeems to acquire electric matter at the ſame time, as appears from an experiment of Mr. Bennet. He put ſome live coals into an inſulated funnel of metal, and throwing on them a little water obſerved that the aſcending ſteam was electriſed plus, and the water which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended through the funnel was electriſed minus. Hence it appears that though clouds by their change of form may ſometimes become electriſed minus yet they have in general an accumulation of electricity. This accumulation of electric matter alſo evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to ſupport the atmoſpheric vapour when it is condenſed into the form of clouds, becauſe it is ſeen to deſcend rapidly after the flaſhes of lightning have diminiſhed its quantity; whence there is reaſon to conclude that very numerous metallic rods with fine points erected high in the air might induce it at any time to part with ſome of its water.</p>

Thus there ſeem to be three diviſions of the globe diſtinctly marked; the firſt I ſuppoſe to have been the original nucleus of the earth, or lava projected from the ſun; 2. over this lie the recrements of animal and vegetable matter produced in the ocean; and, 3. over theſe the recrements of animal and vegetable matter produced upon the land. Beſides theſe there are bodies which owe their origin to a combination of thoſe already mentioned, as ſiliceous ſand, fluor, alabaſter; which ſeem to have derived their acids originally from the vegetable kingdom, and their earthy baſes from ſea-productions.

The nucleus of the earth, ſtill covered with water, received perpetual increaſe by the immenſe quantities of ſhells and coralloids either annually produced and relinquiſhed, or left after the death of the animals. Theſe would gradually by their different degrees of coheſion be ſome of them more and others leſs removable by the influence of ſolar tides, and gentle tropical breezes, which then muſt have probably extended from one pole to the other; for it is ſuppoſed the moon was not yet produced, and that no ſtorms or unequal winds had yet exiſtence.</p>
                              <p>Hence then the primeval iſlands had their gradual origin, were raiſed but a few feet above the level of the ſea, and were not expoſed to the great or ſudden variations of heat and cold, as is ſo well explained in Mr. Whithurſt's Theory of the Earth, chap. xvi. Whence the paradiſe of the ſacred writers, and the golden age of the profane ones, ſeems to have had a real exiſtence. As there can be no rainbow, when the heavens are covered with clouds, becauſe the ſun-beams are then precluded from falling upon the rain-drops oppoſite to the eye of the ſpectator, the rainbow is a mark of gentle or partial ſhowers. Mr. Whitehurſt has endeavoured to ſhow that the primitive iſlands were only moiſtened by nocturnal dews and not by ſhowers, as occurs at this day to the Delta of Egypt; and is thence of opinion, that the rainbow had no exiſtence till after the production of mountains and continents. As the ſalt of the ſea has been gradually accumulating, being waſhed down into it from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies, the ſea muſt originally have been as freſh as river water; and as it is not yet ſaturated with ſalt, muſt become annually more ſaline.

As the earth before the exiſtence of earthquakes was nearly level, and the greateſt part of it covered with ſea; when the firſt great fires began deep in the internal parts of it, thoſe parts would become much expanded; this expanſion would be gradually extended, as the heat increaſed, through the whole terraqueous globe of 7000 miles diameter; the cruſt would thence in many places open into fiſſures, which by admitting the ſea to flow in upon the fire, would produce not only a quantity of ſteam beyond calculation by its expanſion, but would alſo by its decompoſition produce inflammable air and vital air in quantities beyond conception, ſufficient to effect thoſe violent exploſions, the veſtiges of which all over the world excite our admiration and our ſtudy; the difficulty of underſtanding how ſubterraneous fires could exiſt without the preſence of air has diſappeared ſince Dr. Prieſtley's diſcoveries of ſuch great quantities of pure air which conſtitute all the acids, and conſequently exiſt in all ſaline bodies, as ſea-ſalt, nitre, lime-ſtone, and in all calciform ores, as manganeſe, calamy, ochre, and other mineral ſubſtances.

The earthquakes of modern days are of very ſmall extent indeed compared to thoſe of antient times, and are ingeniouſly compared by M. De Luc to the operations of a mole-hill, where from a ſmall cavity are raiſed from time to time ſmall quantities of lava or pumice ſtone. Monthly Review, June, 1790.</p>

If the moon had no atmoſphere at the time of its elevation from the earth; or if its atmoſphere was afterwards ſtolen from it by the earth's attraction; the water on the moon would riſe quickly into vapour; and the cold produced by a certain quantity of this evaporation would congeal the remainder of it. Hence it is not probable that the moon is at preſent inhabited, but as it ſeems to have ſuffered and to continue to ſuffer much by volcanos, a ſufficient quantity of air may in proceſs of time be generated to produce an atmoſphere; which may prevent its heat from ſo eaſily eſcaping, and its water from ſo eaſily evaporating, and thence become fit for the production of vegetables and animals.</p>
                              <p>That the moon poſſeſſes little or no atmoſphere is deduced from the undiminiſhed luſtre of the ſtars, at the inſtant when they emerge from behind her diſk.

The lime-ſtone rocks have had their origin from ſhells formed beneath the ſea, the ſofter ſtrata gradually diſſolving and filling up the interſtices of the harder ones, afterwards when theſe accumulations of ſhells were elevated above the waters the upper ſtrata became diſſolved by the actions of the air and dews, and filled up the interſtices beneath, producing ſolid rocks of different kinds from the coarſe lime-ſtones to the fineſt marbles. When thoſe lime-ſtones have been in ſuch a ſituation that they could form perfect cryſtals they are called ſpars, ſome of which poſſeſs a double refraction, as obſerved by Sir Iſaac Newton. When theſe cryſtals are jumbled together or mixed with ſome colouring impurities it is termed marble, if its texture be equable and firm; if its texture be coarſe and porous yet hard, it is called lime-ſtone; if its texture be very looſe and porous it is termed chalk. In ſome rocks the ſhells remain almoſt unchanged and only covered, or bedded with lime-ſtone, which ſeems to have been diſſolved and ſunk down amongſt them. In others the ſofter ſhells and bones are diſſolved, and only ſharks teeth or harder echini have preſerved their form inveloped in the chalk or lime-ſtone; in ſome marbles the ſolution has been compleat and no veſtiges of ſhell appear, as in the white kind called ſtatuary by the workmen.

                              <p>There is a town in the immenſe ſalt-mines of Cracow in Poland, with a market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, a river, a church, and a famous ſtatue, (here ſuppoſed to be of Lot's wife) by the moiſt or dry appearance of which the ſubterranean inhabitants are ſaid to know when the weather is fair above ground. The galleries in theſe mines are ſo numerous and ſo intricate, that workmen have frequently loſt their way, their lights having been burnt out, and have periſhed before they could be found. Eſſais, &amp;c. par M. Macquart. And though the arches of theſe different ſtories of galleries are boldly executed, yet they are not dangerous; as they are held together or ſupported by large maſſes of timber of a foot ſquare; and theſe vaſt timbers remain perfectly ſound for many centuries, while all other pillars whether of brick, cement, or ſalt ſoon diſſolve or moulder away. Ibid. Could the timbers over water-mill wheels or cellars, be thus preſerved by occaſionally ſoaking them with brine? Theſe immenſe maſſes of rock-ſalt ſeem to have been produced by the evaporation of ſea-water in the early periods of the world by ſubterranean fires. Dr. Hutton's Theory of the Earth. See alſo Theorie des Sources Salees, par Mr. Struve. Hiſtoire de Sciences de Lauſanne. Tom. II. This idea of Dr. Hutton's is confirmed by a fact mentioned in M. Macquart's Eſſais ſur Minerologie, who found a great quantity of foſſil ſhells, principally bi-valves and madre-pores, in the ſalt-mines of Wialiczka near Cracow. During the evaporation of the lakes of ſalt-water, as in artificial ſalt-works, the ſalt begins to cryſtallize near the edges where the water is ſhalloweſt, forming hollow inverted pyramids; which, when they become of a certain ſize, ſubſide by their gravity; if urged by a ſtronger fire the ſalt fuſes or forms large cubes; whence the ſalt ſhaped in hollow pyramids, called flake-ſalt, is better taſted and preſerves fleſh better, than the baſket or powder ſalt; becauſe it is made by leſs heat and thence contains more of the marine acid. The ſea-water about our iſland contains from about one twenty-eighth to one thirtieth part of ſea-ſalt, and about one eightieth of magneſian ſalt. See Brownrigg on Salt.

                              <p>
                                 <hi>Hence orient Nitre.</hi> 1. 143. Nitre is found in Bengal naturally cryſtallized, and is ſwept by brooms from earths and ſtones, and thence called ſweepings of nitre. It has lately been found in large quantities in a natural baſon of calcareous earth at Molfetta in Italy, both in thin ſtrata between the calcareous beds, and in effloreſcences of various beautiful leafy and hairy forms. An account of this nitre-bed is given by Mr. Zimmerman and abridged in Rozier's Journal de Phyſique Fevrier. 1790. This acid appears to be produced in all ſituations where animal and vegetable matters are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly decompoſed, and which are expoſed to the action of the air as on the walls of ſtables, and ſlaughter-houſes; the cryſtals are priſms furrowed by longitudinal groves.</p>
                              <p>Dr. Prieſtley diſcovered that nitrous air or gas which he obtained by diſſolving metals in nitrous acid, would combine rapidly with vital air, and produce with it a true nitrous acid; forming red clouds during the combination; the two airs occupy only the ſpace before occupied by one of them, and at the ſame time heat is given out from the new combination. This dimunition of the bulk of a mixture of nitrous gas and vital air, Dr. Prieſtley ingeniouſly uſed as a teſt of the purity of the latter; a diſcovery of the greateſt importance in the analyſis of airs.</p>
                              <p>Mr. Cavendiſh has ſince demonſtrated that two parts of vital air or oxygene, and one part of phlogiſtic air or azote, being long expoſed to electric ſhocks, unite, and produce nitrous acid. Philos. Trans. Vols. LXXV. and LXXVIII.</p>
                              <p>Azote is one of the moſt abundant elements in nature, and combined with calorique or heat, it forms azotic gas or phlogiſtic air, and compoſes two thirds of the atmoſphere; and is one of the principal component parts of animal bodies, and when united to vital air or oxygene produces the nitrous acid. Mr. Lavoiſier found that 211/2 parts by weight of azote, and 431/2 parts of oxygene produced 64 parts of nitrous gas, and by the further addition of 36 parts of oxygene nitrous acid was produced Traité de Chimie. When two airs become united ſo as to produce an unelaſtic liquid much calorique or heat is of neceſſity expelled from the new combination, though perhaps nitrous acid and oxygenated marine acid admit more heat into their combinations than other acids.</p>

The production of iron from the decompoſition of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table bodies is perpetually preſented to our view; the waters oozing from all moraſſes are chalybeate, and depoſit their ochre on being expoſed to the air, the iron acquiring a calciform ſtate from its union with oxygene or vital air. Where thin moraſſes lie on beds of gravel the latter are generally ſtained by the filtration of ſome of the chalybeate water through them. This formation of iron from vegetable recrements is further evinced by the fern leaves and other parts of vegetables, ſo frequently found in the centre of the knobs or nodules of ſome iron-ores.</p>
                              <p>In ſome of theſe nodules there is a nucleus of whiter iron-earth ſurrounded by many concentric ſtrata of darker and lighter iron-earth alternately. In one, which now lies before me, the nucleus is a priſm of a triangular form with blunted angles, and about half an inch high, and an inch and half broad; on every ſide of this are concentric ſtrata of ſimilar iron-earth alternately browner and leſs brown; each ſtratum is about a tenth of an inch in thickneſs and there are ten of them in number. To what known cauſe can this exactly regular diſtribution of ſo many earthy ſtrata of different colours ſurrounding the nucleus be aſcribed? I dont know that any mineralogiſts have attempted an explanation of this wonderful phenomenon. I ſuſpect it is owing to the polarity of the central nucleus. If iron-filings be regularly laid on paper by means of a ſmall ſieve, and a magnet be placed underneath, the filings will diſpoſe themſelves in concentric curves with vacant intervals between them. Now if theſe iron-filings are conceived to be ſuſpended in a fluid, whoſe ſpecific gravity is ſimilar to their own, and a magnetic bar was introduced as an axis into this fluid, it is eaſy to foreſee that the iron filings would diſpoſe themſelves into concentric ſpheres, with intervals of the circumnatant fluid between them, exactly as is ſeen, in theſe nodules of iron-earth. As all the lavas conſiſt of one fourth of iron, (Kirvan's Mineral) and almoſt all other known bodies, whether of animal or vegetable origin, poſſeſs more or leſs of this property, may not the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a great portion of the globe of the earth into ſtrata of greater or leſs regularity be owing to the polarity of the whole?</p>

The circumſtances which render iron more valuable to mankind than any other metal are, 1. its property of being rendered hard to ſo great a degree and thus conſtituting ſuch excellent tools. It was the diſcovery of this property of iron, Mr. Locke thinks, that gave ſuch pre-eminence to the European world over the American one. 2. Its power of being welded; that is, when two pieces are made very hot and applied together by hammering, they unite compleatly, unleſs any ſcale of iron in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervenes; and to prevent this it is uſual for ſmiths to dip the very hot bar in ſand, a little of which fuſes into fluid glaſs with the ſcale and is ſqueezed out from between the uniting parts by the force of hammering. 3. Its power of acquiring magnetiſm.</p>
                              <p>It is however to be wiſhed that gold or ſilver were diſcovered in as great quantity as iron, ſince theſe metals being indeſtructible by expoſure to air, water, fire or any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acids would ſupply wholeſome veſſels for cookery, ſo much to be deſired, and ſo difficult to obtain, and would form the moſt light and durable coverings for houſes, as well as indeſtructible fire-grates, ovens, and boiling veſſels.

                              <p>
                                 <hi>Laſt Michell's hands.</hi> 1. 193. The diſcovery of the magnet ſeems to have been in very early times; it is mentioned by Plato, Lucretius, Pliny, and Galen, and is ſaid to have taken its name of magnes from Magneſia, a ſea-port of antient Lybia.</p>
                              <p>As every piece of iron which was made magnetical by the touch of a magnet became itſelf a magnet, many attempts were made to improve theſe artificial magnets, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ſucceſs till Servingdon Savary, Eſq. made them of <hi>hardened</hi> ſteel bars, which were ſo powerful that one of them weighing three pounds averdupois would lift another of the ſame weight. Philos. Trans.</p>
                              <p>After this Dr. Knight made very ſucceſſful experiments on this ſubject, which, though he kept his method ſecret, ſeems to have excited others to turn their attention to magnetiſm. At this time the Rev. Mr. Michell invented an equally efficacious and more expeditious way of making ſtrong artificial magnets, which he publiſhed in the end of the year 1750, in which he explained his method of what he called <q>the double touch,</q> and which, ſince Mr. Knight's method has been known, appears to be ſomewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from it.</p>
                              <p>This method of rendering bars of hardened ſteel magnetical conſiſts in holding verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally two or more magnetic bars nearly parallel to each other with their oppoſite poles very near each other, (but nevertheleſs ſeparated to a ſmall diſtance,) theſe are to be ſlided over a line of bars laid horizontally a few times backward and forward. See Michell on Magnetiſm, alſo a detailed account in Chamber's Dictionary.</p>
                              <p>What Mr. Michell propoſed by this method was to include a very ſmall portion of the horizontal bars, intended to be made magnetical, between the joint forces of two or more bars already magnetical, and by ſliding them from end to end every part of the line of bars became ſucceſſively included, and thus bars poſſeſſed of a very ſmall degree of magnetiſm to begin with, would in a few times ſliding backwards and forwards make the other ones much more magnetical than themſelves, which are then to be taken up and uſed to touch the former, which are in ſucceſſion to be laid down horizontally in a line.</p>
                              <p>There is ſtill a great field remains for future diſcoveries in magnetiſm both in reſpect to experiment and theory; the latter conſiſts of vague conjectures the more probable of which are perhaps thoſe of Elpinus, as they aſſimulate it to electricity. One conjecture I ſhall add, viz. that the polarity of magnetiſm may be owing to the earth's rotatory motion. If heat, electricity, and magnetiſm are ſuppoſed to be fluids of different gravities, heat being the heavieſt of them, electricity the next heavy, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm the lighteſt, it is evident that by the quick revolution of the earth the heat will be accumulated moſt over the line, electricity next beneath this, and that the magnetiſm will be detruded to the poles and axis of the earth, like the atmoſpheres of common air and of inflammable gas, as explained in the note on Canto I. l. 123.</p>
                              <p>Electricity and heat will both of them diſplace magnetiſm, and this ſhews that they may gravitate on each other; and hence when too great a quantity of the electric fluid becomes accumulated at the poles by deſcending ſnows, or other unknown cauſes, it may have a tendency to riſe towards the tropics by its centrifugal force, and produce the northern lights.

Sir Iſaac Newton having obſerved the great power of refracting light, which the diamond poſſeſſes above all other cryſtallized or vitreous matter, conjectured that it was an inflammable body in ſome manner congealed. Inſomuch that all the light is reflected which falls on any of its interior ſurfaces at a greater angle of incidence than 24 ½ degrees; whereas an artificial gem of glaſs does not reflect any light from its hinder ſurface, unleſs that ſurface is inclined in an angle of 41 degrees. Hence the diamond reflects half as much more light as a factitious gem in ſimilar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; to which muſt be added its great tranſparency, and the excellent poliſh it is capable of. The diamond had nevertheleſs been placed at the head of cryſtals or precious ſtones by the mineralogiſts, till Bergman ranged it of late in the combuſtible claſs of bodies, becauſe by the focus of Villette's burning mirror it was evaporated by a heat not much greater than will melt ſilver, and gave out light. Mr. Hoepfner however thinks the diſperſion of the diamond by this great heat ſhould be called a phoſphoreſcent eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of it, rather than a combuſtion; and from its other analogies of cryſtallization, hardneſs, tranſparency, and place of its nativity, wiſhes again to replace it amongſt the precious ſtones.

It is now diſcovered that pure air, or oxygene, uniting with variety of baſes forms the various kinds of acids; as the vitriolic acid from pure air and ſulphur; the nitrous acid from pure air and phlogiſtic air, or azote; and carbonic acid, (or fixed air,) from pure air and charcoal. Some of theſe affinities were perhaps portrayed by the Magi of Egypt, who were probably learned in chemiſtry, in their hieroglyphic pictures before the invention of letters, by the loves of Jupiter with terreſtrial ladies. And thus phyſically as well as metaphyſically might be ſaid "Jovis omnia plena."</p>

The times of its greateſt ſplendour were prior to the foundations of Rome, and the reign of one of its beſt princes, Janus, was the oldeſt epoch the Romans knew. The earlieſt hiſtorians ſpeak of the Etruſcans as being then of high antiquity, moſt probably a colony from Phoenicia, to which a Pelaſgian colony acceded, and was united ſoon after Deucalion's flood. The peculiar character of their earthern vaſes conſiſts in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable beauty, ſimplicity, and diverſity of forms, which continue the beſt models of taſte to the artiſts of the preſent times; and in a ſpecies of non-vitreous encauſtic painting, which was reckoned, even in the time of Pliny, among the loſt arts of antiquity, but which has lately been recovered by the ingenuity and induſtry of Mr. Wedgwood. It is ſuppoſed that the principal manufactories were about Nola, at the foot of Veſuvius; for it is in that neighbourhood that the greateſt quantities of antique vaſes have been found; and it is ſaid that the general taſte of the inhabitants is apparently influenced by them; inſomuch that ſtrangers coming to Naples, are commonly ſtruck with the diverſity and elegance even of the moſt ordinary vaſes for common uſes. See D'Hancar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's preliminary diſcourſes to the magnificent collection of Etruſcan vaſes, publiſhed

Coal has probably all been ſublimed more or leſs from the clay, with which it was at firſt formed in decompoſing moraſſes; the petroleum ſeems to have been ſeparated and condenſed again in ſuperior ſtrata, and a ſtill finer kind of oil, as naphtha, has probably had the ſame origin. Some of theſe liquid oils have again loſt their more volatile parts, and become cannel-coal, aſphaltum, jet, and amber, according to the purity of the original foſſil oil. Dr. Prieſtley has ſhewn, that eſſential oils long expoſed to the atmoſphere abſorb both the vital and phlogiſtic part of it; whence it is probable their becoming ſolid may in great meaſure depend, as well as by the exhalation of their more volatile parts. On diſtillation with volatile alcaly all theſe foſſil oils are ſhewn to contain the acid of amber, which evinces the identity of their origin. If a piece of amber be rubbed it attracts ſtraws and hairs, whence the diſcovery of electricity, and whence its name, from electron the Greek word for amber.</p>

The granite rocks and the limeſtone rocks have been cracked to very great depths at the time they were raiſed up by ſubterranean fires; in theſe cracks are found moſt of the metallic ores, except iron and perhaps manganeſe, the former of which is generally found in horizontal ſtrata, and the latter generally near the ſurface of the earth.</p>
                              <p>Philoſophers poſſeſſing ſo convenient a teſt for the diſcovery of iron by the magnet, have long ſince found it in all vegetable and animal matters; and of late Mr. Scheele has diſcovered the exiſtence of manganeſe in vegetable aſhes. Scheele, 56 mem. Stock. 1774. Kirwan. Min. 353. Which accounts for the production of it near the ſurface of earth, and thence for its calciform appearance, or union with vital air. Bergman has likewiſe ſhewn, that the limeſtones which become bluiſh or dark coloured when calcined, poſſeſs a mixture of manganeſe, and are thence preferable as a cement to other kinds of lime. 2. Bergman, 229. Which impregnation with manganeſe has probably been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the decompoſition of ſuperincumbent vegetable matters.</p>
                              <p>Theſe cracks or perpendicular caverns in the granite or limeſtone paſs to unknown depths; and it is up theſe channels that I have endeavoured to ſhew that the ſteam riſes which becomes afterwards condenſed and produces the warm ſprings of this iſland, and other parts of the world. (See note on Fucus, Vol. II.) And up theſe cracks I ſuppoſe certain vapours ariſe, which either alone, or by meeting with ſomething deſcending into them from above, have produced moſt of the metals; and ſeveral of the materials in which they are bedded. Thus the ponderous earth, Barytes, of Derbyſbire, is found in theſe cracks, and is ſtratified frequently with lead-ore, and frequently ſurrounds it. This ponderous earth has been found by Dr. Hoepfner in a granite in Switzerland, and may have thus been ſublimed from immenſe depths by great heat, and have obtained its car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonic or vitriolic acid from above. Annales de Chimie. There is alſo reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that ſomething from above is neceſſary to the formation of many of the metals: at Hawkſtone in Shropſhire, the ſeat of Sir Richard Hill, there is an elevated rock of ſiliceous ſand which is coloured green with copper in many places high in the air; and I have in my poſſeſſion a ſpecimen of lead formed in the cavity of an iron nodule, and another of lead amid ſpar from a crack of a coal-ſtratum; all which countenance the modern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of thoſe metals from deſcending materials. To which ſhould be added, that the higheſt mountains of granite, which have therefore probably never been covered with marine productions on account of their early elevation, nor with vegetable or animal matters on account of their great coldneſs, contain no metallic ores, whilſt the lower ones contain copper and tin in their cracks or veins, both in Saxony, Sileſia, and Cornwall. Kirwan's Mineral. p. 374.</p>
                              <p>The tranſmutation of one metal into another, though hitherto undiſcovered by the alchymiſts, does not appear impoſſible; ſuch tranſmutations have been ſuppoſed to exiſt in nature, thus lapis calaminaris may have been produced from the deſtruction of lead-ore, as it is generally found on the top of the veins of lead, where it has been calcined or united with air, and becauſe maſſes of lead-ore are often found intirely incloſed in it. So ſilver is found mixed in almoſt all lead-ores, and ſometimes in ſeperate filaments within the cavities of lead-ore, as I am informed by Mr. Michell, and is thence probably a partial tranſmutation of the lead to ſilver, the rapid progreſs of modern chemiſtry having ſhewn the analogy between metallic calces and acids, may lead to the power of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting their baſes: a diſcovery much to be wiſhed.</p>

                                 <p> At one o'clock we alighted among ſome acacia trees at Waadi el Halboub, having gone twenty-one miles. We were here at once ſurpriſed and terrified by a ſight ſurely one of the moſt magnificent in the world. In that vaſt expanſe of deſert, from W. to N. W. of us, we ſaw a number of prodigious pillars of ſand at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſtances, at times moving with great celerity, at others ſtalking on with a majeſtic ſlowneſs; at intervals we thought they were coming in a very few minutes to overwhelm us; and ſmall quantities of ſand did actually more than once reach us. Again they would retreat ſo as to be almoſt out of ſight, their tops reaching to the very clouds. There the tops often ſeparated from the bodies; and theſe, once diſjoined, diſperſed in the air, and did not appear more. Sometimes they were broken in the middle, as if ſtruck with large cannon-ſhot. About noon they began to advance with conſiderable ſwiftneſs upon us, the wind being very ſtrong at north. Eleven of them ranged along ſide of us about the diſtance of three miles. The greateſt diameter of the largeſt appeared to me at that diſtance as if it would meaſure ten feet. They retired from us with a wind at S. E. leaving an impreſſion upon my mind to which I can give no name, though ſurely one ingredient in it was fear, with a conſiderable deal of wonder and aſtoniſhment. It was in vain to think of flying; the ſwifteſt horſe, or faſteſt ſailing ſhip, could be of no uſe to carry us out of this danger; and the full perſuaſion of this rivetted me as if to the ſpot where I ſtood.</p>
                                 <p>The ſame appearance of moving pillars of ſand preſented themſelves to us this day in form and diſpoſition like thoſe we had ſeen at Waadi Halboub, only they ſeemed to be more in number and leſs in ſize. They came ſeveral times in a direction cloſe upon us, that is, I believe, within leſs than two miles. They began immediately after ſun riſe like a thick wood and almoſt darkened the ſun. His rays ſhining through them for near an hour, gave them an appearance of pillars of fire. Our people now became deſperate, the Greeks ſhrieked out and ſaid it was the day of judgment; Iſmael pronounced it to be hell; and the Turcorories, that the world was on fire.</p>

                              <p>From this account it would appear, that the eddies of wind were owing to the long range of broken rocks, which bounded one ſide of the ſandy deſert, and bent the currents of air, which ſtruck againſt their ſides; and were thus like the eddies in a ſtream of water, which falls againſt oblique obſtacles. This explanation is probably the true one, as theſe whirl-winds were not attended with rain or lightening like the tornadoes of the Weſt-Indies.</p>

On long expoſure to air the granites or porphories of this country exhibit a ferrugenous cruſt, the iron being calcined by the air firſt becomes viſible, and is then waſhed away from the external ſurface, which becomes white or grey, and thus in time ſeems to decompoſe. The marbles ſeem to decompoſe by looſing their carbonic acid, as the outſide, which has been long expoſed to the air, does not ſeem to efferveſce ſo haſtily with acids as the parts more recently broken. The immenſe quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of carbonic acid, which exiſts in the many provinces of lime-ſtone, if it was extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and decompoſed would afford charcoal enough for fuel for ages, or for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of new vegetable or animal bodies. The volcanic ſlaggs on Mount Veſuvius are ſaid by M. Ferber to be changed into clay by means of the ſulphur-acid, and even pots made of clay and burnt or vitrified are ſaid by him to be again reducible to ductile clay by the volcanic ſteams.

The latter is ſuppoſed to allude to the vinegar and water which was the beverage of his army. In reſpect to the former it is not improbable, but where wood was to be had in great abundance, that fires made round lime-ſtone precipices would calcine them to a conſiderable depth, the night-dews or mountain-miſts would penetrate theſe calcined parts and pulverize them by the force of the ſteam which the generated heat would produce, the winds would diſperſe this lime-powder, and thus by repeated fires a precipice of lime-ſtone might be deſtroyed and a paſſage opened. It ſhould be added, that according to Ferber's obſervations, theſe Alps conſiſt of lime-ſtone. Letters from Italy.</p>

Theſe do not ſeperate except by long putrefaction or by fire. The earth then efferveſces with acids, and can only be converted into glaſs by the greateſt force of fire. The gluten has continued united with the earth of the bones above 2000 years in Egyptian mummies; but by long expoſure to air or moiſture it diſſolves and leaves only the earth. Hence bones long buried, when expoſed to the air, abſorb moiſture and crumble into powder. Phil. Trans. No. 475. The retractibility or elaſticity of the animal fibre depends on the gluten; and of theſe fibres are compoſed the membranes muſcles and bones. Haller. Phyſiol. Tom. 1. p. 2.</p>

                                 <hi>The tranſmigrating Ens.</hi> l. 584. The perpetual circulation of matter in the growth and diſſolution of vegetable and animal bodies ſeems to have given Pythagoras his idea of the metempſycoſis or tranſmigration of ſpirit; which was afterwards dreſſed out or ridiculed in variety of amuſing fables. Other philoſophers have ſuppoſed, that there are two different materials or eſſences, which fill the univerſe. One of theſe, which has the power of commencing or producing motion, is called ſpirit; the other, which has the power of receiving and of communicating motion, but not of beginning it, is called matter. The former of theſe is ſuppoſed to be diffuſed through all ſpace, filling up the interſtices of the ſuns and planets, and conſtituting the gravitations of the ſidereal bodies, the attractions of chemiſtry, with the ſpirit of vegetation, and of animation. The latter occupies comparatively but ſmall ſpace, conſtituting the ſolid parts of the ſuns and planets, and their atmoſpheres. Hence theſe philoſophers have ſuppoſed, that both matter and ſpirit are equally immortal and unperiſhable; and that on the diſſolution of vegetable or animal organization, the matter returns to the general maſs of matter; and the ſpirit to the general maſs of ſpirit, to enter again into new combinations, according to the original idea of Pythagoras.</p>
                              <p>The ſmall apparent quantity of matter that exiſts in the univerſe compared to that of ſpirit, and the ſhort time in which the recrements of animal or vegetable bodies become again vivified in the forms of vegetable mucor or microſcopic inſects, ſeems to have given riſe to another curious fable of antiquity. That Jupiter threw down a large handful of ſouls upon the earth, and left them to ſcramble for the few bodies which were to be had.</p>

                                 <hi>Adonis.</hi> l. 586. The very antient ſtory of the beautiful Adonis paſſing one half of the year with Venus, and the other with Proſerpine alternately, has had variety of interpretations. Some have ſuppoſed that it allegorized the ſummer and winter ſolſtice; but this ſeems too obvious a fact to have needed an hieroglyphic emblem. Others have believed it to repreſent the corn, which was ſuppoſed to ſleep in the earth during the winter months, and to riſe out of it in ſummer. This does not accord with the climate of Egypt, where the harveſt ſoon follows the ſeed-time.</p>
                              <p>It ſeems more probably to have been a ſtory explaining ſome hieroglyphic figures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the decompoſition and reſuſcitation of animal matter; a ſublime and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject, and which ſeems to have given origin to the doctrine of the tranſmigration, which had probably its birth alſo from the hieroglyphic treaſures of Egypt. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that the cypreſs groves in the antient greek writers, as in Theocritus, were dedicated to Venus; and afterwards became funereal emblems. Which was probably occaſioned by the Cypreſs being an accompaniment of Venus in the annual proceſſions, in which ſhe was ſuppoſed to lament over the funeral of Adonis; a ceremony which obtained over all the eaſtern world from great antiquity, and is ſuppoſed to be referred to by Ezekiel, who accuſes the idolatrous woman of weeping for Thammus.</p>

It does not appear that any confuſion would follow the indiſcriminate uſe of the ſame word for the paſt tenſe and the participle paſſive, ſince the auxillary verb <hi>have,</hi> or the preceding noun or pronoun always clearly diſtinguiſhes them: and laſtly, rhime-poetry muſt loſe the uſe of many elegant words without this licenſe.</p>

The clouds conſiſt of condenſed vapour, the particles of which are too ſmall ſeparately to overcome the tenacity of the air, and which therefore do not deſcend. They are in ſuch ſmall ſpheres as to repel each other, that is, they are applied to each other by ſuch very ſmall ſurfaces, that the attraction of the particles of each drop to its own centre is greater than its attraction to the ſurface of the drop in its vicinity; every one has obſerved with what difficulty ſmall ſpherules of quickſilver can be made to unite, owing to the ſame cauſe; and it is common to ſee on riding through ſhallow water on a clear day, numbers of very ſmall ſpheres of water as they are thrown from the horſes feet run along the ſurface for many yards before they again unite with it. In many caſes theſe ſpherules of water, which compoſe clouds, are kept from uniting by a ſurplus of electric fluid; and fall in violent ſhowers as ſoon as that is withdrawn from them, as in thunder ſtorms. See note on Canto l. 1. 554.</p>
                              <p>If in this ſtate a cloud becomes frozen, it is torn to pieces in its deſcent by the friction of the air, and falls in white flakes of ſnow. Or theſe flakes are rounded by being rubbed together by the winds, and by having their angles thawed off by the warmer air beneath as they deſcend; and part of the water produced by theſe angles thus diſſolved is abſorbed into the body of the hailſtone, as may be ſeen by holding a lump of ſnow over a candle, and there becomes frozen into ice by the quantity of cold which the hailſtone poſſeſſes beneath the freezing point, or which is produced by its quick evaporation in falling; and thus hailſtones are often found of greater or leſs denſity according as they conſiſt of a greater portion of ſnow or ice. If hailſtones conſiſted of the large drops of ſhowers frozen in their deſcent, they would conſiſt of pure tranſparent ice.</p>
                              <p>As hail is only produced in ſummer, and is always attended with ſtorms, ſome philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have believed that the ſudden departure of electriclty from a cloud may effect ſomething yet unknown in this phenomenon; but it may happen in ſummer independent of electricity, becauſe the aqueous vapour is then raiſed higher in the atmoſphere, whence it has further to fall, and there is warmer air below for it to fall through.</p>

During the coldneſs of the night the moiſture before diſſolved in the air is gradually precipitated, and as it ſubſides adheres to the bodies it falls upon. Where the attraction of the body to the particles of water is greater than the attractions of thoſe particles to each other, it becomes ſpread upon their ſurface, or ſlides down them in actual contact; as on the broad parts of the blades of moiſt graſs: where the attraction of the ſurface to the water is leſs than the attraction of the particles of water to each other, the dew ſtands in drops; as on the points and edges of graſs or gorſe, where the ſurface preſented to the drop being ſmall it attracts it ſo little as but juſt to ſupport it without much changing its globular form: where there is no attraction between the vegetable ſurface and the dew drops, as on cabbage leaves, the drop does not come into contact with the leaf, but hangs over it repelled, and retains it natural form, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the attraction and preſſure of its own parts, and thence looks like quickſilver, reflecting light from both its ſurfaces. Nor is this owing to any oilineſs of the leaf, but ſimply to the poliſh of its ſurface, as a light needle may be laid on water in the ſame manner without touching it; for as the attractive powers of poliſhed ſurfaces are greater when in actual contact, ſo the repulſive power is greater before contact.</p>

Miſts are clouds reſting on the ground, they generally come on at the beginning of night, and either fill the moiſt vallies, or hang on the ſummits of hills, according to the degree of moiſture previouſly diſſolved, and the education of heat from them. The air over rivers during the warmth of the day ſuſpends much moiſture, and as the changeful ſurface of rivers occaſions them to cool ſooner than the land at the approach of evening, miſts are moſt frequently ſeen to begin over rivers, and to ſpread themſelves over moiſt grounds, and fill the vallies, while the miſts on the tops of mountains are more properly clouds, condenſed by the coldneſs of their ſituation.</p>
                              <p>On aſcending up the ſide of a hill from a miſty valley, I have obſerved a beautiful coloured halo round the moon when a certain thickneſs of miſt was over me, which ceaſed to be viſible as ſoon as I emerged out of it; and well remember admiring with other ſpectators the ſhadow of the three ſpires of the cathedral church at Lichfield, the moon riſing behind it, apparently broken off, and lying diſtinctly over our heads as if horizontally on the ſurface of the miſt, which aroſe about as high as the roof of the church. There are ſome curious remarks on ſhadows or reflections ſeen on the ſurface of miſts from high mountains in Ulloa's Voyages. The dry miſt of ſummer 1783, was probably occaſioned by volcanic eruption, as mentioned in note on Chunda, Vol. II. and therefore more like the atmoſphere of ſmoke which hangs on ſtill days over great cities.</p>
                              <p>There is a dry miſt, or rather a diminiſhed tranſparence of the air, which according to Mr. Sauſſure accompanies fair weather, while great tranſparence of air indicates rain. Thus when large rivers two miles broad, ſuch as at Liverpool, appear narrow, it is ſaid to prognoſticate rain; and when wide, fair weather. This want of tranſparence of the air in dry weather, may be owing to new combinations or decompoſitions of the vapours diſſolved in it, but wants further inveſtigation.

The phenomena of the tides have been well inveſtigated and ſatiſfactorily explained by Sir Iſaac Newton and Dr. Halley from the reciprocal gravitations of the earth, moon, and ſun. As the earth and moon move round a centre of motion near the earth's ſurface, at the ſame time that they are proceeding in their annual orbit round the ſun, it follows that the water on the ſide of the earth neareſt this centre of motion between the earth and moon will be more attracted by the moon, and the waters on the oppoſite ſide of the earth will be leſs attracted by the moon, than the central parts of the earth. Add to this that the centrifugal force of the water on the ſide of the earth furtheſt from the centre of the motion, round which the earth and moon move, (which, as was ſaid before, is near the ſurface of the earth) is greater than that on the oppoſite ſide of the earth, From both theſe cauſes it is eaſy to comprehend that the water will riſe on two ſides of the earth, viz. on that neareſt to the moon, and its oppoſite ſide, and that it will be flattened in conſequence at the quadratures, and thus produce two tides in every lunar day, which conſiſts of about twenty-four hours and forty-eight minutes.</p>
                                 <p>Theſe tides will be alſo affected by the ſolar attraction when it coincides with the lunar one, or oppoſes it, as at new and full moon, and will alſo be much influenced by the oppoſing ſhores in every part of the earth.</p>
                                 <p>Now as the moon in moving round the centre of gravity between itſelf and the earth deſcribes a much larger orbit than the earth deſcribes round the ſame centre, it follows that the centrifugal motion on the ſide of the moon oppoſite to the earth muſt be much greater than the centrifugal motion of the ſide of the earth oppoſite to the moon round the ſame centre, And ſecondly, as the attraction of the earth exerted on the moon's ſurface next to the earth is much greater than the attraction of the moon exerted on the earth's ſurface, the tides on the lunar ſea, (if ſuch there be,) ſhould be much greater than thoſe of our ocean. Add to this that as the ſame face of the moon always is turned to the earth, the lunar tides muſt be permanent, and if the ſolid parts of the moon be ſpherical, muſt always cover the phaſis next to us. But as there are evidently hills and vales and volcanos on this ſide of the moon, the conſequence is that the moon has no ocean, or that it is frozen.</p>

The ſpiral form of many ſhells ſeem to have afforded a more frugal manner of covering the long tail of the fiſh with calcareous armour; ſince a ſingle thin partition between the adjoining circles of the fiſh was ſufficient to defend both ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, and thus much cretaceous matter is ſaved; and it is probable that from this ſpiral form they are better enabled to feel the vibrations of the element in which they exiſt. See note on Canto IV. l. 162. This cretaceous matter is formed by a mucous ſecretion from the ſkin of the fiſh, as is ſeen in crab-fiſh, and others which annually caſt their ſhells, and is at firſt a ſoft mucous covering, (like that of a hen's egg, when it is laid a day or two too ſoon,) and which gradually hardens. This may alſo be ſeen in common ſhell ſnails, if a part of their ſhell be broken it becomes repaired in a ſimilar manner with mucus, which by degrees hardens into ſhell.</p>
                                 <p>It it probable the calculi or ſtones found in other animals may have a ſimilar origin, as they are formed on mucous membranes, as thoſe of the kidney and bladder, chalk-ſtones in the gout, and gall-ſtones; and are probably owing to the inflammation of the membrane where they are produced, and vary according to the degree of inflammation of the membrane which forms them, and the kind of mucous which it naturally produces. Thus the ſhelly matter of different ſhell-fiſh differs, from the courſer kinds which form the ſhells of crabs, to the finer kinds which produces the mother-pearl.</p>
                                 <p>The beautiful colours of ſome ſhells originate from the thinneſs of the laminae of which they conſiſt, rather than to any colouring matter, as is ſeen in mother-pearl, which reflects different colours according to the obliquity of the light which falls on it. The beautiful priſmatic colours ſeen on the Labrodore ſtone are owing to a ſimilar cauſe, viz. the thinneſs of the laminae of which it conſiſts, and has probably been formed from mother-pearl ſhells.</p>
                                 <p>It is curious that ſome of the moſt common foſſil ſhells are not now known in their recent ſtate, as the cornua ammonis; and on the contrary, many ſhells which are very plentiful in their recent ſtate, as limpets, ſea-ears, volutes, cowries, are very rarely found foſſil. Da Coſta's Conchology, p. 163. Were all the ammoniae deſtroyed when the continents were raiſed? Or do ſome genera of animals periſh by the increaſing power of their enemies? Or do they ſtill reſide at inacceſſible depths in the ſea? Or do ſome animals change their forms gradually and become new genera?</p>

Mr. Reaumur thinks they are formed like the hard concretions in many land animals as ſtones of the bladder, gall-ſtones, and bezoar, and hence concludes them to be a diſeaſe of the fiſh, but there ſeems to be a ſtricter analogy between theſe and the calcareous productions found in crab-fiſh called crab's eyes, which are formed near the ſtomach of the animal, and conſtitute a reſervoir of calcareous matter againſt the renovation of the ſhell, at which time they are re-diſſolved and depoſited for that purpoſe. As the internal part of the ſhell of the pearl oyſter or muſcle conſiſts of mother-pearl which is a ſimilar material to the pearl and as the animal has annually occaſion to enlarge his ſhell there is reaſon to ſuſpect the looſe pearls are ſimilar reſervoirs of the pearly matter for that purpoſe.</p>

Water in deſcending down elevated ſituations if the outlet for it below is not ſufficient for its emiſſion acts with a force equal to the height of the column, as is ſeen in an experimental machine called the philoſophical bellows, in which a few pints of water are made to raiſe many hundred pounds. To this cauſe is to be aſcribed many large promontories of ice being occaſionally thrown down from the glaciers; rocks have likewiſe been thrown from the ſides of mountains by the ſame cauſe, and large portions of earth have been removed many hundred yards from their ſituations at the foot of mountains. On inſpecting the locomotion of about thirty acres of earth with a ſmall houſe near Bilder's Bridge in Shropſhire, about twenty years ago, from the foot of a mountain towards the river, I well remember it bore all the marks of having been thus lifted up, puſhed away, and as it were crumpled into ridges, by a column of water contained in the mountain.</p>
                              <p>From water being thus confined in high columns between the ſtrata of mountainous countries it has often happened that when wells or perforations have been made into the earth, that ſprings have ariſen much above the ſurface of the new well. When the new bridge was building at Dublin Mr. G. Semple found a ſpring in the bed of the river where he meant to lay the foundation of a pierre, which, by fixing iron pipes into it, he raiſed many feet. Treatiſe on Building in Water, by G. Semple. From having obſerved a valley north-weſt of St. Alkmond's well near Derby, at the head of which that ſpring of water once probably exiſted, and by its current formed the valley, (but which in after times found its way out in its preſent ſituation,) I ſuſpect that St. Alkmond's well might by building round it be raiſed high enough to ſupply many ſtreets in Derby with ſpring-water which are now only ſupplied with river-water. See an account of an artificial ſpring of water, Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXV. p. 1.</p>
                              <p>In making a well at Sheerneſs the water roſe 300 feet above its ſource in the well. Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXIV. And at Hartford in Connecticut there is a well which was dug ſeventy feet deep before water was found, then in boring an augur-hole through a rock the water roſe ſo faſt as to make it difficult to keep it dry by pumps till they could blow the hole larger by gunpowder, which was no ſooner accompliſhed than it filled and run over, and has been a brook for near a century.

                                 <hi>Dark monſoon inſhrouds.</hi> l. 129. When from any peculiar ſituations of land in reſpect to ſea the tropic becomes more heated, when the ſun is vertical over it, than the line, the periodical winds called monſoons are produced, and theſe are attended by rainy ſeaſons; for as the air at the tropic is now more heated than at the line it aſcends by decreaſe of its ſpecific gravity, and floods of air ruſh in both from the South Weſt and North Eaſt, and theſe being one warmer than the other the rain is precipitated by their mixture as obſerved by Dr. Hutton. See additional notes, No. XXV. All late travellers have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed the riſe of the Nile to the monſoons which deluge Nubia and Abyſſinia with rain. The whirling of the aſcending air was even ſeen by Mr. Bruce in Abyſſinia; he ſays, <q>every morning a ſmall cloud began to whirl round, and preſently after the whole heavens became covered with clouds,</q> by this vortex of aſcending air the N. E. winds and the S. W. winds, which flow in to ſupply the place of the aſcending column, became mixed more rapidly and depoſited their rain in greater abundance.</p>
                              <p>Mr. Volney obſerves that the time of the riſing of the Nile commences about the 19th of June, and that Abyſſinia and the adjacent parts of Africa are deluged with rain in May, June, and July, and produce a maſs of water which is three months in draining off. The Abbe Le Pluche obſerves that as Sirius, or the dog-ſtar, roſe at the time of the commencement of the flood its riſing was watched by the aſtronomers, and notice given of the approach of inundation by hanging the figure of Anubis, which was that of a man with a dog's head, upon all their temples.

There ſeem to be two ſituations which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be exempted from rain falling upon them, one where the conſtant trade-winds meet beneath the line, for here two regions of warm air are mixed together, and thence do not ſeem to have any cauſe to precipitate their vapour; and the other is, where the winds are brought from colder climates and become warmer by their contact with the earth of a warmer one. Thus Lower Egypt is a flat country warmed by the ſun more than the higher lands of one ſide of it, and than the Mediterranean on the other; and hence the winds which blow over it acquire greater warmth, which ever way they come, than they poſſeſſed before, and in conſequence have a tendency to acquire and not to part with their vapour like the north-eaſt winds of this country. There is ſaid to be a narrow ſpot upon the coaſt of Peru where rain ſeldom occurs, at the ſame time according to Ulloa on the mountainous regions of the Andes beyond there is almoſt perpetual rain. For the wind blows uniformly upon this hot part of the coaſt of Peru, but no cauſe of devaporation occurs till it begins to aſcend the mountainous Andes, and then its own expanſion produces cold ſufficient to condenſe its vapour.</p>

The boiling column of water at Gieſar in Iceland was nineteen feet in diameter, and ſometimes roſe to the height of ninety-two feet. On cooling it depoſited a ſiliceous matter or chalcedony forming a baſon round its baſe. The heat of this water before it roſe out of the earth could not be aſcertained, as water looſes all its heat above 212 (as ſoon as it is at liberty to expand) by the exhalation of a part, but the flinty baſon which is depoſited from it ſhews that water with great degrees of heat will diſſolve ſiliceous matter. Van Troil's Letters on Iceland. Since the above account in the year 1780 this part of Iceland has been deſtroyed by an earthquake or covered with lava, which was probably effected by the force of aqueous ſteam, a greater quantity of water falling on the ſubterraneous fires than could eſcape by the antient outlets and generating an increaſed quantity of vapour.

The bath at Buxton being of 82 degrees of heat is called a warm bath, and is ſo compared with common ſpring-water which poſſeſſes but 48 degrees of heat, but is nevertheleſs a cold bath compared to the heat of the body which is 98. On going into this bath there is therefore always a chill perceived at the firſt immerſion, but after having been in it a minute the chill ceaſes and a ſenſation of warmth ſucceeds though the body continues to be immerſed in the water. The cauſe of this curious phenomenon is to be looked for in the laws of animal ſenſation and not from any properties of heat. When a perſon goes from clear day-light into an obſcure room for a while it appears gloomy, which gloom however in a little time ceaſes, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of light becomes no longer perceived. This is not ſolely owing to the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the iris of the eye, ſince that is performed in an inſtant, but to this law of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that when a leſs ſtimulus is applied (within certain bounds) the ſenſibility increaſes. Thus at going into a bath as much colder than the body as that of Buxton, the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heat on the ſkin is at firſt perceived, but in about a minute the ſenſibility to heat increaſes and the nerves of the ſkin are equally excited by the leſſened ſtimulus. The ſenſation of warmth at emerging from a cold-bath, and the pain called the hot-ach, after the hands have been immerſed in ſnow, depend on the ſame principle, viz. the increaſed ſenſibility of the ſkin after having been previouſly expoſed to a ſtimulus leſs than uſual.</p>

Until very lately water was eſteemed a ſimple element, nor are all the moſt celebrated chemiſts of Europe yet converts to the new opinion of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſition. Mr. Lavoiſier and others of the French ſchool have moſt ingeniouſly endeavoured to ſhew that water conſiſts of pure air, called by them oxygene, and of inflammable air, called hydrogene, with as much of the matter of heat, or calorique, as is neceſſary to preſerve them in the form of gas. Gas is diſtinguiſhed from ſteam by its preſerving its elaſticity under the preſſure of the atmoſphere, and in the greateſt degrees of cold yet known. The hiſtory of the progreſs of this great diſcovery is detailed in the Memoires of the Royal Academy for 1781, and the experimental proofs of it are delivered in Lavoiſier's Elements of Chemiſtry. The reſults of which are that water conſiſts of eighty-five parts by weight of oxygene, and fifteen parts by weight of hydrogene, with a ſufficient quantity of Calorique. Not only numerous chemical phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, but many atmoſpherical and vegetable facts receive clear and beautiful eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation from this important analyſis. In the atmoſphere inflammable air is probably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually uniting with vital air and producing moiſture which deſcends in dews and ſhowers, while the growth of vegetables by the aſſiſtance of light is perpetually again decompoſing the water they imbibe from the earth, and while they retain the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable air for the formation of oils, wax, honey, reſin, &amp;c. they give up the vital air to repleniſh the atmoſphere.</p>

The allegorical interpretation of the very antient mythology which ſuppoſes Jupiter to repreſent the ſuperior part of the atmoſphere or ether, and Juno the inferior air, and that the conjunction of theſe two produces vernal ſhowers, as alluded to in Virgil's Georgies, is ſo analogous to the preſent important diſcovery of the production of water from pure air, or oxygene, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable air, or hydrogene, (which from its greater levity probably reſides over the former,) that one ſhould be tempted to believe that the very antient chemiſts of Egypt had diſcovered the compoſition of water, and thus repreſented it in their hieroglyphic figures before the invention of letters.</p>
                              <p>In the paſſage of Virgil Jupiter is called ether, and deſcends in prolific ſhowers on the boſom of Juno, whence the ſpring ſucceeds and all nature rejoices.</p>

The invention of the pump is of very antient date, being aſcribed to one Cteſebes an Athenian, whence it was called by the Latins machina Cteſebiana; but it was long before it was known that the aſcent of the piſton lifted the ſuperincumbent column of the atmoſphere, and that then the preſſure of the ſurrounding air on the ſurface of the well below forced the water up into the vacuum, and that on that account in the common lifting pump the water would riſe only about thirty-five feet, as the weight of ſuch a column of water was in general an equipoiſe to the ſurrounding atmoſphere. The foamy appearance of water, when the preſſure of the air over it is diminiſhed, is owing to the expanſion and eſcape of the air previouſly diſſolved by it, or exiſting in its pores. When a child firſt ſucks it only preſſes or champs the teat, as obſerved by the great Harvey, but afterwards it learns to make an incipient vacuum in its mouth, and acts by removing the preſſure of the atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere from the nipple, like a pump.</p>

The addition of an air-cell to machines for raiſing water to extinguiſh fire was firſt introduced by Mr. Newſham of London, and is now applied to ſimilar engines for waſhing wall-trees in gardens, and to all kinds of forcing pumps, and might be applied with advantage to lifting pumps where the water is brought from a great diſtance horizontally. Another kind of machine was invented by one Greyl, in which a veſſel of water was every way diſperſed by the exploſion of gun-powder lodging in the centre of it, and lighted by an adapted match; from this idea Mr. Godfrey propoſed a water-bomb of ſimilar conſtruction. Dr. Hales to prevent the ſpreading of fire propoſed to cover the floors and ſtairs of the adjoining houſes with earth; Mr. Hartley propoſed to prevent houſes from taking fire by covering the cieling with thin iron-plates, and Lord Mahon by a bed of coarſe mortar or plaiſter between the cieling and floor above it. May not this age of chemical ſcience diſcover ſome method of injecting or ſoaking timber with lime-water and afterwards with vitriolic acid, and thus fill its pores with alabaſter? or of penetrating it with ſiliceous matter, by proceſſes ſimilar to thoſe of Bergman and Achard?

The upper ſide of the leaf is the organ of vegetable reſpiration, as explained in the additional notes, No XXXVII, hence the leaf is liable to injury from much moiſture on this ſurface, and is deſtroyed by being ſmeared with oil, in theſe reſpects reſembling the lungs of animals or the ſpiracula of inſects. To prevent theſe injuries ſome leaves repel the dew-drops from their upper ſurfaces as thoſe of cabbages; other vegetables cloſe the upper furfaces of their leaves together in the night or in wet weather, as the ſenſitive plant; others only hang their leaves downwards ſo as to ſhoot the wet from them, as kidney-beans, and many trees.

                                 <hi>Golden bell.</hi> l. 440. There are muſcles placed about the footſtalks of the leaves or leaflets of many plants, for the purpoſe of cloſing their upper ſurfaces together, or of bending them down ſo as to ſhoot off the ſhowers or dew-drops, as mentioned in the preceeding note. The claws of the petals or of the diviſions of the calyx of many flowers are furniſhed in a ſimilar manner with muſcles, which are exerted to open or cloſe the corol and calyx of the flower as in tragopogon, anemone. This action of opening and cloſing the leaves or flowers does not appear to be produced ſimply by <hi>irritation</hi> on the muſcles themſelves, but by the connection of thoſe muſcles with a <hi>ſenſitive</hi> ſenſorium or brain exiſting in each individual bud or flower. 1ſt. Becauſe many flowers cloſe from the defect of ſtimulus, not by the exceſs of it, as by darkneſs, which is the abſence of the ſtimulus of light; or by cold, which is the abſence of the ſtimulus of heat. Now the defect of heat, or the abſence of food, or of drink, affects our <hi>ſenſations,</hi> which had been previouſly accuſtomed to a greater quantity of them; but a muſcle cannot be ſaid to be ſtimulated into action by a defect of ſtimulus. 2. Becauſe the muſcles around the footſtalks of the ſubdiviſions of the leaves of the ſenſitive plant are exerted when any injury is offered to the other extremity of the leaf, and ſome of the ſtamens of the flowers of the claſs Syngeneſia contract themſelves when others are irritated. See note on Chondrilla, Vol. II. of this work.</p>
                              <p>From this circumſtance the contraction of the muſcles of vegetables ſeems to depend on a diſagreeable <hi>ſenſation</hi> in ſome diſtant part, and not on the <hi>irritation</hi> of the muſcles themſelves. Thus when a particle of duſt ſtimulates the ball of the eye, the eye-lids are inſtantly cloſed, and when too much light pains the retina, the muſcles of the iris contract its aperture, and this not by any connection or conſent of the nerves of thoſe parts, but as an effort to prevent or to remove a diſagreeable ſenſation, which evinces that vegetables are endued with ſenſation, or that each bud has a common ſenſorium, and is furniſhed with a brain or a central place where its nerves were connected.</p>

Beſides the ſupplying water to the herbage in dryer ſeaſons, it ſeems to defend it from froſt in the early part of the year, and thus doubly advances the vegetation. The waters which riſe from ſprings paſſing through marl or limeſtone are replete with calcareous earth, and when thrown over moraſſes they depoſit this earth and incruſt or conſolidate the moraſs. This kind of earth is depoſited in great quantity from the ſprings at Matlock bath, and ſupplies the ſoft porous limeſtone of which the houſes and walls are there conſtructed; and has formed the whole bank for near a mile on that ſide of the Derwent on which they ſtand.</p>
                              <p>The water of many ſprings contains much azotic gas, or phlogiſtic air, beſides car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonic gas, or fixed air, as that of Buxton and Bath; this being ſet at liberty may more readily contribute to the production of nitre by means of the putreſcent matters which it is expoſed to by being ſpread upon the ſurface of the land; in the ſame manner as frequently turning over heaps of manure facilitates the nitrous proceſs by impriſoning atmoſpheric air in the interſtices of the putreſcent materials. Water ariſing by land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floods brings along with it much of the moſt ſoluble parts of the manure from the higher lands to the lower ones. River-water in its clear ſtate and thoſe ſprings which are called ſoft are leſs beneficial for the purpoſe of watering lands, as they contain leſs earthy or ſaline matter; and water from diſſolving ſnow from its ſlow ſolution brings but little earth along with it, as may be ſeen by the comparative clearneſs of the water of ſnow-floods.</p>

The importance of the nectarium or honey-gland in the vegetable economy is ſeen from the very complicated apparatus, which nature has formed in ſome flowers for the preſervation of their honey from inſects, as in the aconites or monkſhoods; in other plants inſtead of a great apparatus for its protection a greater ſecretion of it is produced that thence a part may be ſpared to the depredation of inſects. The cacalia ſuaveolens produces ſo much honey that on ſome days it may be ſmelt at a great diſtance from the plant. I remember once counting on one of theſe plants beſides bees of various kinds without number, above two hundred painted butterflies, which gave it the beautiful appearance of being covered with additional flowers.</p>

                                 <hi>The enamour'd oxygene.</hi> l. 34. The common air of the atmoſphere appears by the analyſis of Dr. Prieſtley and other philoſophers to conſiſt of about three parts of an elaſtic fluid unfit for reſpiration or combuſtion, called azote by the French ſchool, and about one fourth of pure vital air fit for the ſupport of animal life and of combuſtion, called oxygene. The principal ſource of the azote is probably from the decompoſition of all vegetable and animal matters by putrefaction and combuſtion; the principal ſource of vital air or oxygene is perhaps from the decompoſition of water in the organs of vegetables by means of the ſun's light. The difficulty of injecting vegetable veſſels ſeems to ſhew that their perſpirative pores are much leſs than thoſe of animals, and that the water which conſtitutes their perſpiration is ſo divided at the time of its excluſion that by means of the ſun's light it becomes decompoſed, the inflammable air or hydrogene, which is one of its conſtituent parts, being retained to form the oil, reſin, wax, honey, &amp;c. of the vegetable economy; and the other part, which united with light or heat becomes vital air or oxygene gas, riſes into the atmoſphere and repleniſhes it with the food of life.</p>
                              <p>Dr. Prieſtley has evinced by very ingenious experiments that the blood gives out phlogiſton, and receives vital air, or oxygene-gas by the lungs. And Dr. Crawford has ſhewn that the blood acquires heat from this vital air in reſpiration. There is however ſtill a ſomething more ſubtil than heat, which muſt be obtained in reſpiration from the vital air, a ſomething which life can not exiſt a few minutes without, which ſeems neceſſary to the vegetable as well as to the animal world, and which as no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized veſſels can confine it, requires perpetually to be renewed.

I ſaw from the S. E. a haze come in colour like the purple part of a rainbow, but not ſo compreſſed or thick; it did not occupy twenty yards in breadth, and was about twelve feet high from the ground. It was a kind of a bluſh upon the air, and it moved very rapidly, for I ſcarce could turn to fall upon the ground with my head to the northward, when I felt the heat of its current plainly upon my face. We all lay flat upon the ground, as if dead, till Idris told us it was blown over. The meteor, or purple haze, which I ſaw was indeed paſſed; but the light air that ſtill blew was of heat to threaten ſuffocation. For my part I found diſtinctly in my breaſt, that I had imbibed a part of it; nor was I free of an aſthmatic ſenſation till I had been ſome months in Italy.</q>

                                 <p>It is difficult to account for the narrow track of this peſtilential wind, which is ſaid not to exceed twenty yards, and for its ſmall elevation of twelve feet. A whirlwind will paſs forwards, and throw down an avenue of trees by its quick revolution as it paſſes, but nothing like a whirling is deſcribed as happening in theſe narrow ſtreams of air, and whirlwinds aſcend to greater heights. There ſeems but one known manner in which this channel of air could be effected, and that is by electricity.</p>
                                 <p>The volcanic origin of theſe winds is mentioned in the note on Chunda in Vol. II. of this work; it muſt here be added, that Profeſſor Vairo at Naples found, that during the eruption of Veſuvius perpendicular iron bars were electric; and others have obſerved ſuffocating damps to attend theſe eruptions. Ferber's Travels in Italy, p. 133. And laſtly, that a current of air attends the paſſage of electric matter, as is ſeen in preſenting an electrized point to the flame of a candle. In Mr. Bruce's account of this ſimoom, it was in its courſe over a quite dry deſert of ſand, (and which was in conſequence unable to conduct an electric ſtream into the earth beneath it,) to ſome moiſt rocks at but a few miles diſtance; and thence would appear to be a ſtream of electricity from a volcano attended with noxious air; and as the bodies of Mr. Bruce and his attendants were inſulated on the ſand, they would not be ſenſible of their increaſed electricity, as it paſſed over them; to which it may be added, that a ſulphurous or ſuffocating ſenſation is ſaid to accompany flaſhes of lightning, and even ſtrong ſparks of artificial electricity. In the above account of the ſimoom, a great redneſs in the air is ſaid to be a certain ſign of its approach, which may be occaſioned by the eruption of flame from a diſtant volcano in theſe extenſive and impenetrable deſerts of ſand. See Note on l. 292 of this Canto.</p>

He remained uninfected, and ſhe recovered, and was married to him. The ſtory is related by Vinc. Fabricius in the Miſc. Cur. Ann. II. Obſ, 188.</p>

The preſſure of the atmoſphere was diſcovered by Torricelli, a diſciple of Galileo, who had previouſly found that the air had weight. Dr. Hook and M. Du Hamel aſcribe the invention of the air-pump to Mr Boyle, who however confeſſes he had ſome hints concerning its conſtruction from De Guerick. The vacancy at the ſummit of the barometer is termed the Torricellian vacuum, and the exhauſted receiver of an air pump the Boylean vacuum, in honour of theſe two philoſophers.</p>
                                 <p>The miſt and deſcending dew which appear at firſt exhauſting the receiver of an air-pump, are explained in the Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXVIII. from the cold produced by the expanſion of air. For a thermometer placed in the receiver ſinks ſome degrees, and in a very little time, as ſoon as a ſufficient quantity of heat can be acquired from the ſurrounding bodies, the dew becomes again taken up. See additional notes, No. VII. Mr. Sauſſure obſerved on placing his hygrometer in a receiver of an air-pump, that though on beginning to exhauſt it the air became miſty, and parted with its moiſture, yet the hair of his hygrometer contracted, and the inſtrument pointed to greater dryneſs. This unexpected occurrence is explained by M. Monge (Annales de Chymie, Tom. V.) to depend on the want of the uſual preſſure of the atmoſphere to force the aqueous particles into the pores of the hair; and M. Sauſſure ſuppoſes, that his veſicular vapour requires more time to be rediſſolved, than is neceſſary to dry the hair of his thermometer. Eſſais ſur l'Hygrom. p. 226. but I ſuſpect there is a leſs hypothetical way of underſtanding it; when a colder body is brought into warm and moiſt air, (as a bottle of ſpring-water for inſtance,) a ſteam is quickly collected on its ſurface; the contrary occurs when a warmer body is brought into cold and damp air, it continues free from dew ſo long as it continues warm; for it warms the atmoſphere around it, and renders it capable of receiving inſtead of parting with moiſture. The moment the air becomes rarefied in the receiver of the air-pump it becomes colder, as appears by the thermometer, and depoſits its vapour; but the hair of Mr. Sauſſure's hygrometer is now warmer than the air in which it is immerſed, and in conſequence becomes dryer than before, by warming the air which immediately ſurrounds it, a part of its moiſture evaporating along with its heat.</p>

Denſer bodies propagate vibration or ſound better than rarer ones; if two ſtones be ſtruck together under the water, they may be heard a mile or two by any one whoſe head is immerſed at that diſtance, according to an experiment of Dr. Franklin. If the ear be applied to one end of a long beam of timber, the ſtroke of a pin at the other end becomes ſenſible; if a poker be ſuſpended in the middle of a garter, each end of which is preſſed againſt the ear, the leaſt percuſſions on the poker give great ſounds. And I am informed by laying the ear on the ground the tread of a horſe may be diſcerned at a great diſtance in the night. The organs of hearing belonging to fiſh are for this reaſon much leſs complicated than of quadrupeds, as the fluid they are immerſed in ſo much better conveys its vibrations. And it is probable that ſome ſhell-fiſh which have twiſted ſhells like the cochlea and ſemicircular canals of the ears of men and quadrupeds may have no appropriated organ for perceiving the vibrations of the element they live in, but may by their ſpiral form be in a manner all ear.</p>

                                 <hi>Where oft your Prieſtley.</hi> l. 166. The ſame of Dr. Prieſtley is known in every part of the earth where ſcience has penetrated. His various diſcoveries reſpecting the analyſis of the atmoſphere, and the production of variety of new airs or gaſſes, can only be clearly underſtood by reading his Experiments on Airs, (3 vols. octavo, Johnſon, London.) the following are amongſt his many diſcoveries. 1. The diſcovery of nitrous and dephlogiſticated airs. 2. The exhibition of the acids and alkalies in the form of air. 3. Aſcertaining the purity of reſpirable air by nitrous air. 4. The reſtoration of vitiated air by vegetation. 5. The influence of light to enable vegetables to yield pure air. 6. The converſion by means of light of animal and vegetable ſubſtances, that would otherwiſe become putrid and offenſive, into nouriſhment of vegetables. 7. The uſe of reſpiration by the blood parting with phlogiſton, and imbibing dephlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſticated air.</p>
                              <p>The experiments here alluded to are, 1. Concerning the production of nitrous gas from diſſolving iron and many other metals in nitrous acid, which though firſt diſcovered by Dr. Hales (Static. Eſſ. Vol. I. p. 224) was fully inveſtigated, and applied to the important purpoſe of diſtinguiſhing the purity of atmoſpheric air by Dr. Prieſtley. When about two meaſures of common air and one of nitrous gas are mixed together a red efferveſcence takes place, and the two airs occupy about one fourth leſs ſpace than was previouſly occupied by the common air alone.</p>
                              <p>2. Concerning the green ſubſtance which grows at the bottom of reſervoirs of water, which Dr. Prieſtley diſcovered to yield much pure air when the ſun ſhone on it. His method of collecting this air is by placing over the green ſubſtance, which he believes to be a vegetable of the genus conferva, an inverted bell-glaſs previouſly filled with water, which ſubſides as the air ariſes; it has ſince been found that all vegetables give up pure air from their leaves, when the ſun ſhines upon them, but not in the night, which may be owing to the ſleep of the plant.</p>
                              <p>3. The third refers to the great quantity of pure air contained in the calces of metals. The calces were long known to weigh much more than the metallic bodies before calcination, inſomuch that 100 pounds of lead will produce 112 pounds of minium; the ore of manganeſe, which is always found near the ſurface of the earth, is replete with pure air, which is now uſed for the purpoſe of bleaching. Other metals when expoſed to the atmoſphere attract the pure air from it, and become calces by its combination, as zinc, lead, iron; and increaſe in weight in proportion to the air, which they imbibe.</p>

The fable of Proſerpine's being ſeized by Pluto as ſhe was gathering flowers, is explained by Lord Bacon to ſignify the combination or marriage of etherial ſpirit with earthly materials. Bacon's Works, Vol. V. p. 470. edit. 4to. Lond. 1778. This alluſion is ſtill more curiouſly exact, from the late diſcovery of pure air being given up from vegetables, and that then in its unmixed ſtate it more readily combines with metallic or inflammable bodies. From theſe fables which were probably taken from antient hieroglyphics there is frequently reaſon to believe that the Egyptians poſſeſſed much chemical knowledge, which for want of alphabetical writing periſhed with their philoſophers.</p>

                                 <hi>Led by the Sage.</hi> l. 195. Dr. Prieſtley's diſcovery of the production of pure air from ſuch variety of ſubſtances will probably ſoon be applied to the improvement of the diving bell, as the ſubſtances which contain vital air in immenſe quantities are of little value as manganeſe and minium. See additional notes, No. XXXIII. In every hundred weight of minium there is combined about twelve pounds of pure air, now as ſixty pounds of water are about a cubic foot, and as air is eight hundred times lighter than water, five hundred weight of minium will produce eight hundred cubic feet of air or about ſix thouſand gallons. Now, as this is at leaſt thrice as pure as atmoſpheric air, a gallon of it may be ſuppoſed to ſerve for three minutes reſpiration for one man. At preſent the air can not be ſet at liberty from minium by viriolic acid without the application of ſome heat, this is however very likely ſoon to be diſcovered, and will then enable adventurers to journey beneath the ocean in large inverted ſhips or diving balloons.</p>
                              <p>Mr. Boyle relates, that Cornelius Drebelle contrived not only a veſſel to be rowed under water, but alſo a liquor to be caried in that veſſel, which would ſupply the want of freſh air. The veſſel was made by order of James I. and carried twelve rowers beſides paſſengers. It was tried in the river Thames, and one of the perſons who was in that ſubmarine voyage told the particulars of the experiments to a perſon who related them to Mr. Boyle.

Mr. Day periſhed in a diving bell, or diving boat, of his own conſtruction at Plymouth in June 1774, in which he was to have continued for a wager twelve hours one hundred feet deep in water, and probably periſhed from his not poſſeſſing all the hydroſtatic knowledge that was neceſſary. See note on Ulva, Vol. II. of this work. See Annual Regiſter for 1774. p. 245.</p>
                              <p>Mr. Spalding was profeſſionally ingenious in the art of conſtructing and managing the diving bell, and had practiſed the buſineſs many years with ſucceſs. He went down accompanied by one of his young men twice to view the wreck of the Imperial Eaſt-Indiaman at the Kiſh bank in Ireland. On deſcending the third time in June, 1783, they remained about an hour under water, and had two barrels of air ſent down to them, but on the ſignals from below not being again repeated, after a certain time, they were drawn up by their aſſiſtants and both found dead in the bell. Annual Regiſter for 1783, p. 206. Theſe two unhappy events may for a time check the ardor of adventurers in traverſing the bottom of the ocean, but it is probable in another half century it may be ſafer to travel under the ocean than over it, ſince Dr. Prieſtley's diſcovery of procuring pure air in ſuch great abundance from the calces of metals.</p>

The peſtilential winds of the eaſt are deſcribed by various authors under various denominations; as harmattan, ſamiel, ſamium, ſyrocca, kamſin, ſeravanſum. M. de Beauchamp deſcribes a remarkable ſouth wind in the deſerts about Bagdad, called ſeravanſum, or poiſon-wind; it burns the face, impedes reſpiration, ſtrips the trees of their leaves, and is ſaid to paſs on in a ſtreight line, and often kills, people in ſix hours. P. Cotte ſur la Meteorol. Analytical Review for February, 1790. M. Volney ſays, the hot wind or ramſin ſeems to blow at the ſeaſon when the ſands of the deſerts are the hotteſt; the air is then filled with an extreamly ſubtle duſt. Vol. I. p. 61. Theſe winds blow in all directions from the deſerts; in Egypt the moſt violent proceed from the S. S. W. at Mecca from the E. at Surat from the N. at Baſſora from the N. W. at Bagdad from the W. and in Syria from the S. E.</p>
                              <p>On the ſouth of Syria, he adds, where the Jordan flows is a country of volcanos; and it is obſerved that the earthquakes in Syria happen after their rainy ſeaſon, which is alſo conformable to a ſimilar obſervation made by Dr. Shaw in Barbary. Travels in Egypt, Vol. I. p. 303.</p>
                              <p>Theſe winds ſeem all to be of volcanic origin, as before mentioned, with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that the Simoom is attended with a ſtream of electric matter; they ſeem to be in conſequence of earthquakes cauſed by the monſoon floods, which fall on volcanic fires in Syria, at the ſame time that they inundate the Nile.</p>

Nature would ſeem to have been wonderfully prodigal in the ſeeds of vegetables, and the ſpawn of fiſh; almoſt any one plant, if all its ſeeds ſhould grow to maturity, would in a few years alone people the terreſtrial globe. Mr. Ray aſſerts that 1012 ſeeds of tobacco weighed only one grain, and that from one tobacco plant the ſeeds thus calculated amounted to 360,000! The ſeeds of the ferns are by him ſuppoſed to exceed a million on a leaf. As the works of nature are governed by general laws this exuberant reproduction prevents the accidental extinction of the ſpecies, at the ſame time that they ſerve for food for the higher orders of animation.</p>
                              <p>Every ſeed poſſeſſes a reſervoir of nutriment deſigned for the growth of the future plant, this conſiſts of ſtarch, mucilage, or oil, within the coat of the feed, or of ſugar and ſubacid pulp in the fruits, which belongs to it.</p>
                              <p>For the preſervation of the immature ſeed nature has uſed many ingenious methods; ſome are wrapped in down, as the ſeeds of the roſe, bean, and cotton-plant; others are ſuſpended in a large air-veſſel, as thoſe of the bladder-ſena, ſtaphylaea, and pea.</p>

Mr. Whitmill adviſed to bind ſome of the moſt vigorous ſhoots with ſtrong wire, and even ſome of the large roots; and Mr. Warner cuts, what he calls a wild worm about the body of the tree, or ſcores the bark quite to the wood like a ſcrew with a ſharp knife. Bradley on Gardening, Vol. II. p. 155. Mr. Fitzgerald produced flowers and fruit on wall trees by cutting off a part of the bark. Phil. Tranſ. Ann. 1761. M. Buffon produced the ſame effect by a ſtraight bandage put round a branch, Act. Paris, Ann. 1738, and concludes that an ingrafted branch bears better from its veſſels being compreſſed by the callous.</p>
                                 <p>A compleat cylinder of the bark about an inch in height was cut off from the branch of a pear tree againſt a wall in Mr. Howard's garden at Lichfield about five years ago, the circumciſed part is now not above half the diameter of the branch above and below it, yet this branch has been full of fruit every year ſince, when the other branches of the tree bore only ſparingly. I lately obſerved that the leaves of this wounded branch were ſmaller and paler, and the fruit leſs in ſize, and ripened ſooner than on the other parts of the tree. Another branch has the bark taken off not quite all round with much the ſame effect.</p>
                                 <p>The theory of this curious vegetable fact has been eſteemed difficult, but receives great light from the foregoing account of the individuallity of buds. A flower-bud dies, when it has perfected its ſeed, like an annual plant, and hence requires no place on the bark for new roots to paſs downwards; but on the contrary leaf-buds, as they advance into ſhoots, form new buds in the axilla of every leaf, which new buds require new roots to paſs down the bark, and thus thicken as well as elongate the branch, now if a wire or ſtring be tied round the bark, many of theſe new roots cannot deſcend, and thence more of the buds will be converted into flower-buds.</p>

Mr. Hitt in his treatiſe on fruit trees obſerves that if a vigorous branch of a wall tree be bent to the horizon, or beneath it, it looſes its vigour and becomes a bearing branch. The theory of this I ſuppoſe to depend on the difficulty with which the leaf-ſhoots can protrude the roots neceſſary for their new progeny of buds upwards along the bended branch to the earth contrary to their natural habits or powers, whence more flower-ſhoots are produced which do not require new roots to paſs along the bark of the bended branch, but which let their offspring, the ſeeds, fall upon the earth and ſeek roots for themſelves.</p>

Bradley, Vol. II. p. 129. Theſe facts are the more curious ſince from experiments of ingrafting red currants on black (Ib. Vol. II.) the fruit does not acquire any change of flavour, and by many other experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments neither colour nor any other change is produced in the fruit ingrafted on other ſtocks.</p>

                                    <hi>Fair Cyprepedia.</hi> l. 505. The cyprepedium from South America is ſuppoſed to be of larger ſize and brighter colours than that from North America from which this print is taken; it has a large globular nectary about the ſize of a pidgeon's egg of a fleſhy colour, and an inciſion or depreſſion on its upper part, much reſembling the body of the large American ſpider; this globular nectary is attached to divergent ſlender petals not unlike the legs of the ſame animal. This ſpider is called by Linneus Arenea avicularia, with a convex orbicular thorax, the center tranſverſely excavated, he adds that it catches ſmall birds as well as inſects, and has the venemous bite of a ſerpent. Syſtem Nature, Tom. I. p. 1034. M. Lonvilliers de Poincy, (Hiſtoire Nat. des Antilles, Cap. xiv. art. III.) calls it Phalange, and deſcribes the body to be the ſize of a pidgeon's egg, with a hollow on its back like a navel, and mentions its catching the humming-bird in its ſtrong nets.</p>
                                 <p>The ſimilitude of this flower to this great ſpider ſeems to be a vegetable contrivance to prevent the humming-bird from plundering its honey. About Matlock in Derbyſhire the fly-ophris is produced, the nectary of which ſo much reſembles the ſmall wall-bee, perhaps the apis ichneumonea, that it may be eaſily miſtaken for it at a ſmall diſtance. It is probable that by this means it may often eſcape being plundered. See note on lonicera in the next poem.</p>

Linneus enumerates but four diſeaſes of plants; Eryſyche, the white mucor or mould, with ſeſſile tawny heads, with which the leaves are ſprinkled, as is frequent on the hop, humulus, maple, acer, &amp;c. Rubigo, the ferru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineous powder ſprinkled under the leaves frequent in lady's mantle, alchemilla, &amp;c.</p>
                                 <p>Clavus, when the ſeeds grow out into larger horns black without, as in rye. This is called Ergot by the french writers.</p>

The latter is a phagedenic ulcer of the bark, very deſtructive to young apple-trees, and which in cherry-trees is attended with a depoſition of gum arabic, which often terminates in the death of the tree.</p>

There is a diſeaſe frequently affects the rye in France, and ſometimes in England in moiſt ſeaſons, which is called Ergot, or horn ſeed; the grain becomes conſiderably elongated and is either ſtraight or crooked, containing black meal along with the white, and appears to be pierced by inſects, which were probably the cauſe of the diſeaſe. Mr. Duhamel aſcribes it to this cauſe, and compares it to galls on oak-leaves. By the uſe of this bad grain amongſt the poor diſeaſes have been produced attended with great debility and mortification of the extremities both in France and England. Dict. Raiſon. art. Siegle.

                                 <p>The irritability of plants is abundantly evinced by the abſorption and pulmonary circulation of their juices; their ſenſibility is ſhewn by the approaches of the males to the females, and of the females to the males in numerous inſtances; and, as the eſſential circumſtance of ſleep conſiſts in the temporary abolition of voluntary power alone, the ſleep of plants evinces that they poſſeſs voluntary power; which alſo indiſputably appears in many of them by cloſing their petals or their leaves during cold, or rain, or darkneſs, or from mechanic violence.</p>

                     <p>THERE ſeem to be three concentric ſtrata of our incumbent atmoſphere; in
which, or between them, are produced four kinds of meteors; lightning, ſhooting ſtars,
fire-balls, and northern lights. Firſt, the lower region of air, or that which is denſe enough
to reſiſt by the adheſion of its particles the deſcent of condenſed vapour, or clouds, which
may extend from one to three or four miles high. In this region the common lightning is
produced from the accumulation or defect of electric matter in thoſe floating fields of vapour
either in reſpect to each other, or in reſpect to the earth beneath them, or the diſſolved
vapour above them, which is conſtantly varying both with the change of the form of the
clouds, which thus evolve a greater or leſs ſurface; and alſo with their ever-changing
degree of condenſation. As the lightning is thus produced in denſe air, it proceeds but
a ſhort courſe on account of the greater reſiſtance which it encounters, is attended with
a loud exploſion, and appears with a red light.</p>
                     <p>2. The ſecond region of the atmoſphere I ſuppoſe to be that which has too little
tenacity to ſupport condenſed vapour or clouds; but which yet contains inviſible vapour,
or water in aerial ſolution. This aerial ſolution of water differs from that diſſolved in the
matter of heat, as it is supported by its adheſion to the particles of air, and is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
by cold. In this ſtratum it ſeems probable that the meteors called ſhooting
ſtars are produced; and that they conſiſt of electric ſparks, or lightning, paſſing from
one region to another of theſe inviſible fields of aero-aqueous ſolution. The height of
theſe ſhooting ſtars has not yet been aſcertained by ſufficient obſervation; Dr. Blagden
thinks their ſituation is lower down in the atmoſphere than that of fireballs, which he
conjectures from their ſwift apparent motion, and aſcribes their ſmallneſs to the more
minute diviſion of the electric matter of which they are suppoſed to conſiſt, owing to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0811300400:231"/>
the geater reſiſtance of the denſer medium through which they paſs, than that in which
the fire-balls exiſt. Mr. Brydone obſerved that the shooting stars appeared to him to be
as high in the atmoſphere, when he was near the summit of mount Etna, as they do
when obſerved from the plain. Phil. Tran. Vol. LXIII.</p>
                     <p>As the stratum of air, in which shooting stars are suppoſed to exiſt is much rarer
than that in which lightning reſides, and yet much denſer than that in which fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls
are produced, they will be attracted at a greater diſtance than the former, and
at a leſs than the latter. From this rarity of the air so small a sound will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by their exploſion, as not to reach the lower parts of the atmoſphere; their
quantity of light from their greater diſtance being small, is never seen through denſe
air at all, and thence does not appear red, like lightning or fire balls. There are
no apparent clouds to emit or to attract them, becauſe the conſtituent parts of theſe
aero-aqueous regions may poſſeſs an abundance or deficiency of electric matter and yet
be in perfect reciprocal solution. And laſtly their apparent train of light is probably owing
only to a continuance of their impreſſion on the eye; as when a fire-stick is whirled in
the dark it gives the appearance of a compleat circle of fire: for theſe white trains of
shooting stars quickly vaniſh, and do not seem to set any thing on fire in their paſſage,
as seems to happen in the tranſit of fire-balls.</p>
                     <p>3. The second region or stratum of air terminates I suppoſe where the twilight ceaſes
to be refracted, that is, where the air is 3000 times rarer than at the surface of the earth;
and where it seems probable that the common air ends, and is ſurrounded by an atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere
of inflammable gas tenfold rarer than itſelf. In this region I believe fire-balls
ſometimes to paſs, and at other times the northern lights to exiſt. One of theſe fire-balls
or draco volans, was obſerved by Dr. Pringle and many others on Nov. 26, 1758, which
was afterwards eſtimated to have been a mile and a half in circumference, to have been
about one hundred miles high, and to have moved towards the north with a velocity of
near thirty miles in a ſecond of time. This meteor had a real tail many miles long,
which threw off ſparks in its courſe, and the whole exploded with a sound like diſtant
thunder. Philoſ. Tranſ. Vol. LI.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Blagden has related the hiſtory of another large meteor, or fire-ball, which was
ſeen the 18th of Auguſt, 1783, with many ingenious obſervations and conjectures.
This was eſtimated to be between 60 and 70 miles high, and to travel 1000 miles at the
rate of about twenty miles in a ſecond. This fire-ball had likewiſe a real train of light
left behind it in its paſſage, which varied in colour; and in ſome part of its courſe gave
off ſparks or exploſions where it had been brighteſt; and a duſky red streak remained
viſible perhaps a minute. Philoſ. Tranſ. Vol. LXXIV.</p>
                     <p>Theſe fire-balls differ from lightning, and from ſhooting ſtars in many remarkable
circumſtances; as their very great bulk, being a mile and a half in diameter; their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
1000 miles nearly horizontally; their throwing off sparks in their paſſage; and
changing colours from bright blue to duſky red; and leaving a train of fire behind them,
continuing about a minute. They differ from the northern lights in not being diffuſed,
but paſſing from one point of the heavens to another in a defined line; and this in a
region above the crepuſcular atmoſphere, where the air is 3000 times rarer than at the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0811300400:232"/>
ſurface of the earth. There has not yet been even a conjecture which can account for
theſe appearances!—One I ſhall therefore hazard; which, if it does not inform, may
amuſe the reader.</p>
                     <p>In the note on l. 123, it was ſhewn that there is probably a ſupernatant ſtratum of
inflammable gas or hydrogene, over the common atmoſphere; and whoſe denſity at the
ſurface where they meet, muſt be at leaſt ten times leſs than that upon which it ſwims;
like chemical ether floating upon water, and perhaps without any real contact. 1. In
this region, where the aerial atmoſphere terminates and the inflammable one begins, the
quantity of tenacity or reſiſtance muſt be almoſt inconceivable; in which a ball of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity
might paſs 1000 miles with greater eaſe than through a thouſandth part of an
inch of glaſs. 2. Such a ball of electricity paſſing between inflammable and common air
would ſet fire to them in a line as it paſſed along; which would differ in colour accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the greater proportionate commixture of the two airs; and from the same cauſe
there might occur greater degrees of inflammation, or branches of fire, in ſome parts of
its courſe.</p>
                     <p>As theſe fire-balls travel in a defined line, it is pretty evident from the known laws of
electricity, that they muſt be attracted; and as they are a mile or more in diameter, they
muſt be emitted from a large ſurface of electric matter; becauſe large nobs give larger
ſparks, leſs diffuſed, and more brightly luminous, than leſs ones or points, and reſiſt
more forceably the emiſſion of the electric matter. What is there in nature can attract
them at ſo great a diſtance as 1000 miles, and so forceably as to detach an electric ſpark
of a mile diameter? Can volcanos at the time of their eruptions have this effect, as they
are generally attended with lightning? Future obſervations muſt diſcover theſe ſecret
operations of nature! As a stream of common air is carried along with the paſſage of
electric aura from one body to another; it is eaſy to conceive, that the common air and
the inflammable air between which the fire-ball is ſuppoſed to paſs, will be partially
intermixed by being thus agitated, and ſo far as it becomes intermixed it will take fire,
and produce the linear flame and branching ſparks above deſcribed. In this circumſtance
of their being attracted, and thence paſſing in a defined line, the fire-balls ſeem to differ
from the coruſcations of the aurora borealis, or northern lights, which probably take
place in the ſame region of the atmoſphere; where the common air exiſts in extreme
tenuity, and is covered by a ſtill rarer ſphere of inflammable gas, ten times lighter than
itſelf.</p>
                     <p>As the electric ſtreams, which conſtitute theſe northern lights, ſeem to be repelled or
radiated from an accumulation of that fluid in the north, and not attracted like the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls;
this accounts for the diffuſion of their light, as well as the ſilence of their paſſage;
while their variety of colours, and the permanency of them, and even the breadth of
them in different places, may depend on their ſetting on fire the mixture of inflammable
and common air through which they paſs; as ſeems to happen in the tranſit of the
fire-balls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0811300400:233"/>
It was obſerved by Dr. Prieſtley that the electric ſhock taken through inflammable air
was red, in common air it is blueiſh; to theſe circumſtances perhaps ſome of the colours
of the northern lights may bear analogy; though the denſity of the medium through
which light is ſeen muſt principally vary its colour, as is well explained by Mr. Morgan.
Phil. Tranſ. Vol. LXXV. Hence lightning is red when ſeen through a dark cloud, or
near the horizon; becauſe the more refrangible rays cannot permeate so denſe a medium.
But the ſhooting ſtars conſiſt of white light, as they are generally ſeen on clear nights,
and nearly vertical: in other ſituations their light is probably too faint to come to us.
But as in ſome remarkable appearances of the northern lights, as in March, 1716, all
the priſmatic colours were ſeen quickly to ſucceed each other, theſe appear to have been
owing to real combuſtion; as the denſity of the interpoſed medium could not be ſuppoſed
to change ſo frequently; and therefore theſe colours muſt have been owing to different
degrees of heat according to Mr. Morgan's theory of combuſtion. In Smith's Optics,
p. 69. the priſmatic colours, and optical deceptions of the northern lights are deſcribed
by Mr. Cotes.</p>
                     <p>The Torricellian vacuum, if perfectly free from air, is ſaid by Mr. Morgan and
others to be a perfect non-conductor. This circumſtance therefore would preclude the
electric ſtreams from riſing above the atmoſphere. But as Mr. Morgan did not try to
paſs an electric ſhock through a vacuum, and as air, or ſomething containing air, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
the tranſit of electricity may be neceſſary to the production of light, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
may perhaps still be dubious. If however the streams of the northern lights were
suppoſed to riſe above our atmoſphere, they would only be viſible at each extremity of
their courſe; where they emerge from, or are again immerged into the atmoſphere; but
not in their journey through the vacuum; for the abſence of electric light in a vacuum is
ſufficiently proved by the common experiment of ſhaking a barometer in the dark; the
electricity, produced by the friction of the mercury in the glaſs at its top, is luminous if
the barometer has a little air in it; but there is no light if the vacuum be complete.</p>
                     <p>The aurora borealis, or northern dawn, is very ingeniouſly accounted for by Dr.
Franklin on principles of electricity. He premiſes the following electric phenomena:
1. that all new fallen snow has much poſitive electricity standing on its ſurface. 2. That
about twelve degrees of latitude round the poles are covered with a cruſt of eternal ice,
which is impervious to the electric fluid. 3. That the denſe part of the atmoſphere riſes
but a few miles high; and that in the rarer parts of it the electric fluid will paſs to almoſt
any diſtance.</p>
                     <p>Hence he suppoſes there muſt be a great accumulation of poſitive electric matter on the
freſh fallen ſnow in the polar regions; which, not being able to paſs through the cruſt of
ice into the earth, muſt riſe into the rare air of the upper parts of our atmoſphere, which
will the leaſt reſiſt its paſſage; and paſſing towards the equator deſcend again into the
denſer atmoſphere, and thence into the earth in silent streams. And that many of the
appearances attending theſe lights are optical deceptions, owing to the situation of the
eye that beholds them; which makes all aſcending parallel lines appear to converge to a

The idea, above explained in note on l. 123, of the exiſtence of a sphere of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
gas over the aerial atmoſphere would much favour this theory of Dr. Franklin;
becauſe in that caſe the denſe aerial atmoſphere would riſe a much leſs height in the
polar regions, diminiſhing almoſt to nothing at the pole itſelf; and thus give an
eaſier paſſage to the aſcent of the electric fluid. And from the great difference in
the ſpecific gravity of the two airs, and the velocity of the earth's rotation, there
muſt be a place between the poles and the equator, where the superior atmoſphere
of inflammable gas would terminate; which would account for theſe ſtreams of the
aurora borealis not appearing near the equator; add to this that it is probable the electric
fluid may be heavier than the magnetic one; and will thence by the rotation of the
earth's surface aſcend over the magnetic one by its centrifugal force; and may thus be
induced to riſe through the thin ſtratum of aerial atmoſphere over the poles. See note
on Canto II. l. 193. I ſhall have occaſion again to mention this great accumulation of
inflammable air over the poles; and to conjecture that theſe northern lights may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the union of inflammable with common air, without the aſſiſtance of the
electric ſpark to throw them into combuſtion.</p>
                     <p>The antiquity of the appearance of northern lights has been doubted; as none were
recorded in our annals ſince the remarkable one on Nov. 14, 1574, till another remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
one on March 6, 1716, and the three following nights, which were ſeen at the
same time in Ireland, Ruſſia, and Poland, extending near 30 degrees of longitude and
from about the 50th degree of latitude over almoſt all the north of Europe. There is
however reaſon to believe them of remote antiquity though inaccurately deſcribed; thus
the following curious paſſage from the Book of Maccabees, (B. II. c. v.) is ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of them, as might probably be given by an ignorant and alarmed people.
<q>Through all the city, for the ſpace of almoſt forty days, there were ſeen horſemen run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

troops of horſemen in array encountering and running one againſt another, with ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſhields and multitude of pikes, and drawing of ſwords, and caſting of darts, and
glittering of golden ornaments and harneſs.</q>

                     <p>THE manner in which the rainbow is produced was in some meaſure underſtood
before Sir Iſaac Newton had diſcovered his theory of colours. The firſt perſon who
expreſſly ſhewed the rainbow to be formed by the reflection of the sunbeams from drops
of falling rain was Antonio de Dominis. This was afterwards more fully and diſtinctly
explained by Des Cartes. But what cauſed the diverſity of its colours was not then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;
it was reſerved for the immortal Newton to diſcover that the rays of light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siſted
of ſeven combined colours of different refrangibility, which could be ſeperated at
pleaſure by a wedge of glaſs. Pemberton's View of Newton.</p>
                     <p>Sir Iſaac Newton diſcovered that the priſmatic ſpectrum was compoſed of ſeven colours
in the following proportions, violet 80, indigo 40, blue 60, green 60, yellow 48, orange 27,
red 45. If all theſe colours be painted on a circular card in the proportions above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and the card be rapidly whirled on its center, they produce in the eye the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of white. And any one of theſe colours may be imitated by painting a card with
the two colours which are contiguous to it, in the ſame proportions as in the ſpectrum,
and whirling them in the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>My ingenious friend, Mr. Galton of Birmingham, aſcertained in this manner by a set
of experiments the following propoſitions; the truth of which he had preconceived from
the above data.</p>
                     <p>1. Any colour in the priſmatic ſpectrum may be imitated by a mixture of the two
colours contiguous to it.</p>
                     <p>2. If any three succeſſive colours in the priſmatic ſpectrum are mixed, they compoſe
only the ſecond or middlemoſt colour.</p>
                     <p>3. If any four succeſſive colours in the priſmatic ſpectrum be mixed, a tint similar to
a mixture of the ſecond and third colours will be produced, but not preciſely the ſame,
becauſe they are not in the ſame proportion.</p>
                     <p>4. If beginning with any colour in the circular ſpectrum, you take of the ſecond
colour a quantity equal to the firſt, second, and third; and add to that the fifth colour,
equal in quantity to the fourth, fifth, and ſixth; and with theſe combine the ſeventh
colour in the proportion it exiſts in the ſpectrum, white will be produced. Becauſe the
firſt, ſecond, and third, compoſe only the ſecond; and the fourth, fifth, and ſixth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
only the fifth; therefore if the ſeventh be added, the ſame effect is produced, as if
all the ſeven were employed.</p>
                     <p>5. Beginning with any colour in the circular ſpectrum, if you take a tint compoſed of
a certain proportion of the ſecond and third, (equal in quantity to the firſt, ſecond, third,
and fourth,) and add to this the ſixth colour equal in quantity to the fifth, ſixth, and
ſeventh, white will be produced.</p>

                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0811300400:236"/>
From theſe curious experiments of Mr. Galton many phenomena in the chemical
changes of colours may probably become better underſtood; eſpecially if, as I ſuppoſe,
the ſame theory muſt apply to tranſmitted colours, as to reflected ones. Thus it is well
known, that if the glaſs of mangoneſe, which is a tint probably compoſed of violet and
indigo, be mixed in a certain proportion with the glaſs of lead, which is yellow; that the
mixture becomes tranſparent. Now from Mr. Galton's experiments it appears, that in
reflected colours such a mixture would produce white, that is, the same as if all the colours
were reflected. And therefore in tranſmitted colours the ſame circumſtances muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
tranſparency, that is, the same as if all the colours were tranſmitted. For the
particles, which conſtitute the glaſs of mangoneſe will tranſmit red, violet, indigo, and blue;
and thoſe of the glaſs of lead will tranſmit orange, yellow, and green; hence all the
primary colours by a mixture of theſe glaſſes become tranſmitted, that is, the glaſs
becomes tranſparent.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Galton has further obſerved that five succeſſive priſmatic colours may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
in ſuch proportions as to produce but one colour, a circumſtance which might be
of conſequence in the art of painting. For if you begin at any part of the circular
spectrum above deſcribed, and take the firſt, second, and third colours in the proportions
in which they exiſt in the ſpectrum; theſe will compoſe only the ſecond colour equal in
quantity to the firſt, ſecond, and third; add to theſe the third, fourth, and fifth in the
proportion they exiſt in the ſpectrum, and theſe will produce the fourth colour equal in
quantity to the third, fourth, and fifth. Conſequently this is preciſely the ſame thing, as
mixing the ſecond and fourth colours only; which mixture would only produce the third
colour. Therefore if you combine the firſt, ſecond, fourth, and fifth in the proportions
in which they exiſt in the ſpectrum, with double the quantity of the third colour, this
third colour will be produced. It is probable that many of the unexpected changes in
mixing colours on a painter's eaſle, as well as in more fluid chemical mixtures, may
depend on theſe principles rather than on a new arrangement or combination of their
minute particles.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Galton further obſerves, that white may univerſally be produced by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of one priſmatic colour, and a tint intermediate to two others. Which tint may
be diſtinguiſhed by a name compounded of the two colours, to which it is intermediate.
Thus white is produced by a mixture of red with blue-green. Of orange with indigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blue.
Of Yellow with violet-indigo. Of green with red-violet. Of blue with Orange-red.
Of indigo with yellow-orange. Of violet with green-yellow. Which he further remarks
exactly coincides with the theory and facts mentioned by Dr. Robert Darwin of Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
in his account of ocular ſpectra; who has ſhewn that when one of theſe contraſted
colours has been long viewed, a ſpectrum or appearance of the other becomes viſible in
the fatigued eye. Philoſ. Tranſ. Vol. LXXVI. for the year 1786.</p>
                     <p>Theſe experiments of Mr. Galton might much aſſiſt the copper-plate printers of
callicoes and papers in colours; as three colours or more might be produced by two
copper-plates. Thus ſuppoſe ſome yellow figures were put on by the firſt plate, and
upon ſome parts of theſe yellow figures and on other parts of the ground blue was laid
on by another copper-plate. The three colours of yellow, blue, and green might be
produced; as green leaves with yellow and blue flowers.</p>

                     <p>THE rays from the riſing and ſetting ſun are refracted by our ſpherical atmoſphere,
hence the moſt refrangible rays, as the violet, indigo, and blue are reflected in greater
quantities from the morning and evening ſkies; and the leaſt refrangible ones, as red
and orange, are laſt ſeen about the ſetting ſun. Hence Mr. Beguelin obſerved that the
ſhadow of his finger on his pocket-book was much bluer in the morning and evening,
when the ſhadow was about eight times as long as the body from which it was projected.
Mr. Melville obſerves, that the blue rays being more refrangible are bent down in the
evenings by our atmoſphere, while the red and orange being leſs refrangible continue to
paſs on and tinge the morning and evening clouds with their colours. See Prieſtley's
Hiſtory of Light and Colours, p. 440. But as the particles of air, like thoſe of water,
are themſelves blue, a blue ſhadow may be ſeen at all times of the day, though much
more beautifully in the mornings and evenings, or by means of a candle in the middle
of the day. For if a ſhadow on a piece of white paper is produced by placing your finger
between the paper and a candle in the day light, the ſhadow will appear very blue; the
yellow light of the candle upon the other parts of the paper apparently deepens the blue
by its contraſt; theſe colours being oppoſite to each other, as explained in note II.</p>
                     <p>Colours are produced from clouds or miſts by refraction, as well as by reflection.
In riding in the night over an unequal country I obſerved a very beautiful coloured
halo round the moon, whenever I was covered with a few feet of miſt, as I aſcended
from the vallies; which ceaſed to appear when I roſe above the miſt. This I ſuppoſe
was owing to the thinneſs of the stratum of miſt, in which I was immerſed; had it been
thicker, the colours refracted by the ſmall drops, of which a fog conſiſts, would not
have paſſed through it down to my eye.</p>
                     <p>There is a bright ſpot seen on the cornea of the eye, when we face a window, which
is much attended to by portrait painters; this is the light reflected from the ſpherical
surface of the poliſhed cornea, and brought to a focus; if the obſerver is placed in this
focus, he ſees the image of the window; if he is placed before or behind the focus, he
only sees a luminous ſpot, which is more luminous and of leſs extent, the nearer he
approaches to the focus. The luminous appearance of the eyes of animals in the duſky
corners of a room, or in holes in the earth, may ariſe in ſome inſtances from the same
principle; viz. the reflection of the light from the spherical cornea; which will be coloured
red or blue in ſome degree by the morning, evening, or meridian light; or by the objects
from which that light is previouſly reflected. In the cavern at Colebrook Dale, where
the mineral tar exſudes, the eyes of the horſe, which was drawing a cart from within
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0811300400:238"/>
towards the mouth of it, appeared like two balls of phoſphorus, when he was above 100
yards off, and for a long time before any other part of the animal was viſible. In this
caſe I suſpect the luminous appearance to have been owing to the light, which had entered
the eye, being reflected from the back surface of the vitreous humour, and thence emerg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again in parallel rays from the animals eye, as it does from the back surface of the
drops of the rainbow, and from the water-drops which lie, perhaps without contact, on
cabbage leaves, and have the brilliancy of quickſilver. This accounts for this luminous
appearance being beſt seen in thoſe animals which have large apertures in their iris, as in
cats and horſes, and is the only part viſible in obſcure places, becauſe this is a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
surface than any other part of the animal. If any of theſe emergent rays from the
animals eye can be suppoſed to have been reflected from the choroid coat through the
semi-tranſparent retina, this would account for the coloured glare of the eyes of dogs or
cats and rabits in dark corners.</p>

                     <p>THERE have been many theories invented to account for the tails of comets. Sir
Iſaac Newton thinks that they conſiſt of rare vapours raiſed from the nucleus of the comet,
and ſo rarefied by the sun's heat as to have their general gravitation diminiſhed, and that
they in conſequence aſcend oppoſite to the ſun, and from thence reflect the rays of light.
Dr. Halley compares the light of the tails of comets to the ſtreams of the aurora berealis,
and other electric effluvia. Philoſ. Tranſ. No. 347.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Hamilton obſerves that the light of ſmall ſtars are ſeen undiminiſhed through
both the light of the tails of comets, and of the aurora borealis, and has further illuſtrated
their electric analogy, and adds that the tails of comets conſiſt of a lucid ſelf-ſhining ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which has not the power of refracting or reflecting the rays of light. Eſſays.</p>
                     <p>The tail of the comet of 1744 at one time appeared to extend above 16 degrees from
its body, and muſt have thence been above twenty three millions of miles long. And
the comet of 1680, according to the calculations of Dr. Halley on November the 11th,
was not above one ſemi-diameter of the earth, or leſs than 4000 miles to the northward
of the way of the earth; at which time had the earth been in that part of its orbit, what
might have been the conſequence! no one would probably have ſurvived to have
regiſtered the tremendous effects.</p>

                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0811300400:239"/>
The comet of 1531, 1607, and 1682 having returned in the year 1759, according to
Dr. Halley's prediction in the Philoſ. Tranſ. for 1705, there ſeems no reaſon to doubt
that all the other comets will return after their proper periods. Aſtronomers have in
general acquieſced in the conjecture of Dr. Halley, that the comets of 1532, and 1661
are one and the ſame comet, from the ſimilarity of the elements of their orbits, and were
therefore induced to expect its return to its perihelium 1789. As this comet is liable to
be diſturbed in its aſcent from the ſun by the planets Jupiter and Saturn, Dr. Maſkelyne
expected its return to its perihelium in the beginning of the year 1789, or the latter end
of the year 1788, and certainly ſometime before the 27th of April, 1789, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction

                     </q>
                     <p>THE diſpute among philoſophers about phlogiſton is not concerning the exiſtence of
an inflammable principle, but rather whether there be one or more inflammable principles.
The diſciples of Stahl, which till lately included the whole chemical world, believed in
the identity of phlogiſton in all bodies which would flame or calcine. The diſciples of
Lavoiſier pay homage to a plurality of phlogiſtons under the various names of charcoal,
sulphur, metals, &amp;c. Whatever will unite with <hi>pure</hi> air, and thence compoſe an acid, is
eſteemed in this ingenious theory to be a different kind of phlogiſtic or inflammable body.
At the same time there remains a doubt whether theſe inflammable bodies, as metals,
ſulphur, charcoal, &amp;c. may not be compounded of the ſame phlogiſton along with ſome
other material yet undiſcovered, and thus an unity of phlogiſton exiſt, as in the theory of
Stahl, though very differently applied in the explication of chemical phenomena.</p>
                     <p>Some modern philoſophers are of opinion that the ſun is the great fountain from
which the earth and other planets derive all the phlogiſton which they poſſes; and that
this is formed by the combination of the ſolar rays with all opake bodies, but particularly
with the leaves of vegetables, which they suppoſe to be organs adapted to abſorb them.
And that as animals receive their nouriſhment from vegetables they alſo obtain in a
ſecondary manner their phlogiſton from the ſun. And laſtly as great maſſes of the mineral
kingdom, which have been found in the thin cruſt of the earth which human labour has
penetrated, have evidently been formed from the recrements of animal and vegetable
bodies, theſe alſo are suppoſed thus to have derived their phlogiſton from the sun.</p>
                     <p>Another opinion concerning the ſun's rays is, that they are not luminous till they
arrive at our atmoſphere; and that there uniting with ſome part of the air they produce
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0811300400:240"/>
combuſtion, and light is emitted, and that an etherial acid, yet undiſcovered, is formed
from this combuſtion.</p>
                     <p>The more probable opinion is perhaps, that the ſun is a phlogiſtic maſs of matter,
whoſe ſurface is in a ſtate of combuſtion, which like other burning bodies emits light
with immenſe velocity in all directions; that theſe rays of light act upon all opake
bodies, and combining with them either diſplace or produce their elementary heat, and
become chemically combined with the phlogiſtic part of them; for light is given out
when phlogiſtic bodies unite with the oxygenous principle of the air, as in combuſtion,
or in the reduction of metallic calxes; thus in preſenting to the flame of a candle a letter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wafer,
(if it be coloured with red-lead,) at the time the red-lead becomes a metallic drop,
a flaſh of light is perceived. Dr. Alexander Wilſon very ingeniouſly endeavours to prove
that the sun is only in a ſtate of combuſtion on its ſurface, and that the dark ſpots ſeen on
the diſk are excavations or caverns through the luminous cruſt, some of which are 4000
miles in diameter. Phil. Trans. 1774. Of this I ſhall have occaſion to speak again.</p>

                     <p>M. DE MAIRAN in a paper publiſhed in the Hiſtoire de l'Academic de Sciences,
1765, has endeavoured to ſhew that the earth receives but a ſmall part of the heat which
it poſſeſſes, from the ſun's rays, but is principally heated by fires within itſelf. He thinks
the ſun is the cauſe of the viciſſitudes of our ſeaſons of ſummer and winter by a very
ſmall quantity of heat in addition to that already reſiding in the earth, which by emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from the centre to the circumference renders the ſurface habitable, and without
which, though the ſun was conſtantly to illuminate two thirds of the globe at once,
with a heat equal to that at the equator, it would ſoon become a maſs of ſolid ice. His
reaſonings and calculations on this ſubject are too long and too intricate to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
here, but are equally curious and ingenious and carry much conviction along with
them.</p>
                     <p>The opinion that the center of the earth conſiſts of a large maſs of burning lava, has
been eſpouſed by Boyle, Boerhave, and many other philoſophers. Some of whom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
its ſuppoſed effects on vegetation and the formation of minerals have called it a
ſecond ſun. There are many arguments in ſupport of this opinion. 1. Becauſe the
power of the ſun does not extend much beyond ten feet deep into the earth, all below
being in winter and ſummer always of the ſame degree of heat, viz. 48, which being
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0811300400:241"/>
much warmer than the mildeſt froſt, is ſuppoſed to be ſuſtained by ſome internal diſtant
fire. Add to this however that from experiments made ſome years ago by Dr. Franklin
the ſpring-water at Philadelphia appeared to be of 52° of heat, which ſeems further to
confirm this opinion, ſince the climates in North America are ſuppoſed to be colder
than thoſe of Europe under ſimilar degrees of latitude. 2. Mr. De Luc in going 1359
feet perpendicular into the mines of Hartz on July the 5th, 1778, on a very fine day found
the air at the bottom a little warmer than at the top of the ſhaft. Phil. Tranſ. Vol.
LXIX. p. 488. In the mines in Hungary, which are 500 cubits deep, the heat becomes
very troubleſome when the miners get below 480 feet depth. <hi>Morinus de Locis ſubter.</hi>
p. 131. But as ſome other deep mines as mentioned by Mr. Kirwan are ſaid to poſſeſs but
the common heat of the earth; and as the cruſt of the globe thus penetrated by human
labour is ſo thin compared with the whole, no certain deduction can be made from theſe
facts on either ſide of the queſtion. 3. The warm-ſprings in many parts of the earth at
great diſtance from any Volcanos ſeem to originate from the condenſation of vapours
ariſing from water which is boiled by ſubterraneous fires, and cooled again in their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
through a certain length of the colder ſoil; for the theory of chemical ſolution will
not explain the equality of their heat at all ſeaſons and through ſo many centuries. See

upon the ſummit of the higheſt mountains. For as theſe mountains have been lifted up
and loſe ſeveral of their uppermoſt ſtrata as they riſe, the loweſt ſtrata of the earth yet
known appear at the tops of the higheſt hills; and the beds of the Volcanos upon theſe
hills muſt in conſequence belong to the loweſt ſtrata of the earth, conſiſting perhaps of
granite or baſaltes, which were produced before the exiſtance of animal or vegetable
bodies, and might conſtitute the original nucleus of the earth, which I have ſuppoſed
to have been projected from the ſun, hence the volcanos themſelves appear to be ſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula
or chimneys belonging to great central fires. It is probably owing to the eſcape of
the elaſtic vapours from theſe ſpiracula that the modern earthquakes are of ſuch ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
compared with thoſe of remote antiquity, of which the veſtiges remain all over the
globe. 5. The great ſize and height of the continents, and the great ſize and depth of
the South-ſea, Atlantic, and other oceans, evince that the firſt earthquakes, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
theſe immenſe changes in the globe, muſt have been occaſioned by central fires.
6. The very diſtant and expeditious communication of the ſhocks of ſome great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.
The earthquake at Liſbon in 1755 was perceived in Scotland, in the Peak of
Derbyſhire, and in many other diſtant parts of Europe. The percuſſions of it travelled
with about the velocity of ſound, viz. about thirteen miles in a minute. The earthquake
in 1693 extended 2600 leagues. (Goldſmith's Hiſtory.) Theſe phenomena are eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
if the central parts of the earth conſiſt of a fluid lava, as a percuſſion on one part
of ſuch a fluid maſs would be felt on other parts of its confining vault, like a ſtroke on a
fluid contained in a bladder, which however gentle on one ſide is perceptible to the hand
placed on the other; and the velocity with which ſuch a concuſſion would travel would
be that of ſound, or thirteen miles in a minute. For further information on this part of
the ſubject the reader is referred to Mr. Michell's excellent Treatiſe on Earthquakes in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0811300400:242"/>
Philos. Tranſ. Vol. LI. 7. That there is a cavity at the center of the earth is made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
by the late experiments on the attraction of mountains by Mr. Maſkerlyne, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
from other conſiderations that the denſity of the earth near the ſurface ſhould be
five times leſs than its mean denſity. Phil. Trans. Vol. LXV. p. 498. But found from
the attraction of the mountain Schehallien, that it is probable, the mean denſity of the
earth is but double that of the hill. Ibid. p. 532. Hence if the firſt ſuppoſition be well
founded there would appear to be a cavity at the centre of conſiderable magnitude, from
whence the immenſe beds and mountains of lava, toadſtone, baſaltes, granite, &amp;c. have
been protruded. 8. The variation of the compaſs can only be accounted for by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the central parts of the earth to conſiſt of a fluid maſs, and that part of this fluid
is iron, which requiring a greater degree of heat to bring it into fuſion than glaſs or other
metals, remains a ſolid, and the vis inertiae of this fluid maſs with the iron in it, occaſions
it to perform ſewer revolutions than the cruſt of ſolid earth over it, and thus it is gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
left behind, and the place where the floating iron reſides is pointed to by the direct
or retrograde motions of the magnetic needle. This ſeems to have been nearly the
opinion of Dr. Halley and Mr. Euler.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>A CERTAIN quantity of heat ſeems to be combined with all bodies beſides the
ſenſible quantity which gravitates like the electric fluid amongſt them. This combined
heat or latent heat of Dr. Black, when ſet at liberty by fermentation, inflammation,
cryſtallization, freezing, or other chemical attractions producing new <hi>combinations,</hi> paſſes
as a fluid element into the ſurrounding bodies. And by thawing, diffuſion of neutral
ſalts in water, melting, and other chemical ſolutions, a portion of heat is attracted from
the bodies in vicinity and enters into or becomes combined with the new ſolutions.</p>
                     <p>Hence a combination of metals with acids, of eſſential oils and acids, of alcohol and
water, of acids and water, give out heat; whilſt a <hi>ſolution</hi> of ſnow in water or in acids,
and of neutral ſalts in water, attract heat from the ſurrounding bodies. So the acid of
nitre mixed with oil of cloves unites with it and produces a moſt violent flame; the ſame
acid of nitre poured on ſnow inſtantly diſſolves it and produces the greateſt degree of cold
yet known, by which at Peterſburgh quickſilver was firſt frozen in 1760.</p>
                     <p>Water may be cooled below 32° without being frozen, if it be placed on a ſolid floor
and ſecured from agitation, but when thus cooled below the freezing point the leaſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0811300400:243"/>
agitation turns part of it ſuddenly into ice, and when this ſudden freezing takes place a
thermometer placed in it inſtantly riſes as ſome heat is given out in the act of congelation,
and the ice is thus left with the ſame <hi>ſenſible</hi> degree of cold as the water had poſſeſſed
before it was agitated, but is nevertheleſs now combined with leſs <hi>latent</hi> heat.</p>
                     <p>A cubic inch of water thus cooled down to 32° mixed with an equal quantity of boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
water at 212° will cool it to the middle number between theſe two, or to 122. But
a cubit inch of ice whoſe ſenſible cold alſo is but 32, mixed with an equal quantity of
boiling water, will cool it ſix times as much as the cubic inch of cold water above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
as the ice not only gains its ſhare of the ſenſible or gravitating heat of the
boiling water but attracts to itſelf alſo and combines with the quantity of latent heat
which it had loſt at the time of its congelation.</p>
                     <p>So boiling water will acquire but 212° of heat under the common preſſure of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere,
but the ſteam raiſed from it by its expanſion or by its ſolution in the atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere
combines with and carries away a prodigious quantity of heat which it again parts
with on its condenſation; as is ſeen in common diſtillation where the large quantity of
water in the worm-tub is ſo ſoon heated. Hence the evaporation of ether on a ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer
ſoon ſinks the mercury below freezing, and hence a warmth of the air in winter
frequently ſucceeds a ſhower.</p>
                     <p>When the matter of heat or calorique is ſet at liberty from its combinations, as by
inflammation, it paſſes into the ſurrounding bodies, which poſſeſs different capacities of
acquiring their ſhare of the looſe or ſenſible heat; thus a pint meaſure of cold water at 48°
mixed with a pint of boiling water at 212° will cool it to the degree between theſe two
numbers, or to 154°, but it requires two pint meaſures of quickſilver at 48° of heat to
cool one pint of water as above. Theſe and other curious experiments are adduced by
Dr. Black to evince the exiſtance of combined or latent heat in bodies, as has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
by ſome of his pupils, and well illuſtrated by Dr. Crawford. The world has
long been in expectation of an account of his diſcoveries on this ſubject by the celebrated
author himſelf.</p>
                     <p>As this doctrine of elementary heat in its fluid and combined ſtate is not yet univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
received, I ſhall here add two arguments in ſupport of it drawn from different ſources,
viz. from the heat given out or abſorbed by the mechanical condenſation or expanſion of
the air, and perhaps of other bodies, and from the analogy of the various phenomena of
heat with thoſe of electricity.</p>
                     <p>I. If a thermometer be placed in the receiver of an air-pump, and the air haſtily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
the thermometer will ſink ſome degrees, and the glaſs become ſteamy; the
ſame occurs in haſtily admitting a part of the air again. This I ſuppoſe to be produced
by the expanſion of part of the air, both during the exhauſtion and re-admiſſion of it;
and that the air ſo expanded becomes capable of attracting from the bodies in its vicinity
a part of their heat, hence the vapours contained in it and the glaſs receiver are for a
time colder and the ſteam is precipitated. That the air thus parts with its moiſture from
the cold occaſioned by its rarefaction and not ſimply by the rarefaction itſelf is evident,
becauſe in a minute or two the ſame rarefied air will again take up the dew depoſited on
the receiver; and becauſe water will evaporate ſooner in rare than in denſe air.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0811300400:244"/>
There is a curious phenomenon ſimilar to this obſerved in the fountain of Hiero con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
on a large ſcale at the Chemnicenſian mines in Hungary. In this machine the air
in a large veſſel is compreſſed by a column of water 260 feet high, a ſtop-cock is then
opened, and as the air iſſues out with great vehemence, and thus becomes immediately
greatly expanded, ſo much cold is produced that the moiſture from this ſtream of air is
precipitated in the form of ſnow, and ice is formed adhering to the noſel of the cock.
This remarkable circumſtance is deſcribed at large with a plate of the machine in Philos.
Trans. Vol. LII. for 1761.</p>
                     <p>The following experiment is related by Dr. Darwin in the Philos. Trans. Vol.
LXXVIII. Having charged an air-gun as forcibly as he well could the air-cell and ſyringe
became exceedingly hot, much more ſo than could be aſcribed to the friction in working
it; it was then left about half an hour to cool down to the temperature of the air, and a
thermometer having been previouſly fixed againſt a wall, the air was diſcharged in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
ſtream on its bulb, and it ſunk many degrees. From theſe three experiments
of the ſteam in the exhauſtéd receiver being depoſited and re-abſorbed, when a part of the
air is exhauſted or re-admitted, and the ſnow produced by the fountain of Hiero, and
the extraordinary heat given out in charging, and the cold produced in diſcharging an
air-gun, there is reaſon to conclude that when air is mechanically compreſſed the
elementary fluid heat is preſſed out of it, and that when it is mechanically expanded the
ſame fluid heat is re-abſorbed from the common maſs.</p>
                     <p>It is probable all other bodies as well as air attract heat from their neighbours when
they are mechanically expanded, and give it out when they are mechanically condenſed.
Thus when a vibration of the particles of hard bodies is excited by friction or by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion,
theſe particles mutually recede from and approach each other reciprocally; at
the times of their receſſion from each other, the body becomes enlarged in bulk, and is
then in a condition to attract heat from thoſe in its vicinity with great and ſudden power;
at the times of their approach to each other this heat is again given out, but the bodies
in contact having in the mean while received the heat they had thus loſt, from other
bodies behind them, do not ſo ſuddenly or ſo forcibly re-abſorb the heat again from the
body in vibration; hence it remains on its ſurface like the electric fluid on a rubbed glaſs
globe, and for the ſame reaſon, becauſe there is no good conductor to take it up again.
Hence at every vibration more and more heat is acquired and ſtands looſe upon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face;
as in filing metals or rubbing glaſs tubes; and thus a ſmith with a few ſtrokes on
a nail on his anvil can make it hot enough to light a brimſtone-match; and hence in
ſtriking flint and ſteel together heat enough is produced to vitrify the parts thus ſtrucken
off, the quantity of which heat is again probably increaſed by the new chemical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination.</p>
                     <p>II. The analogy between the phenomena of the electric fluid and of heat furniſhes
another argument in ſupport of the exiſtence of heat as a gravitating fluid. 1. They are
both accumulated by friction on the excited body. 2. They are propagated eaſily or
with difficalty along the ſame claſſes of bodies; with eaſe by metals, with leſs eaſe by
water; and with difficulty by reſins, bees-wax, ſilk, air, and glaſs. Thus glaſs canes
or canes of ſealing-wax may be melted by a blow-pipe or a candle within a quarter of an
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0811300400:245"/>
inch of the fingers which hold them, without any inconvenient heat, while a pin or
other metallic ſubſtance applyed to the flame of a candle ſo readily conducts the heat as
immediately to burn the fingers. Hence clothes of ſilk keep the body warmer than clothes
of linen of equal thickneſs, by confining the heat upon the body. And hence plains are
ſo much warmer than the ſummits of mountains by the greater denſity of the air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
the acquired heat upon them. 3. They both give out light in their paſſage
through air, perhaps not in their paſſage through a vacuum. 4. They both of them
fuſe or vitrify metals. 5. Bodies after being electrized if they are mechanically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
will receive a greater quantity of electricity, as in Dr. Franklin's experiment of
the chain in the tankard; the ſame ſeems true in reſpect to heat as explained above.
6. Both heat and electricity contribute to ſuſpend ſteam in the atmoſphere by producing
or increaſing the repulſion of its particles. 7. They both gravitate, when they have
been accumulated, till they find their equilibrium.</p>
                     <p>If we add to the above the many chemical experiments which receive an eaſy and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
explanation from the ſuppoſed matter of heat, as employed in the works of Bergman
and Lavoiſier, I think we may reaſonably allow of its exiſtence as an element, occaſionally
combined with other bodies, and occaſionally exiſting as a fluid, like the electric fluid
gravitating amongſt them, and that hence it may be propagated from the central fires
of the earth to the whole maſs, and contribute to preſerve the mean heat of the earth,
which in this country is about 48 degrees but variable from the greater or leſs effect of
the ſun's heat in different climates, ſo well explained in Mr. Kirwan's Treatiſe on the
Temperature of different Latitudes. 1787, Elmſly. London.</p>

                     <p>THE gigantic ſtatue of Memnon in his temple at Thebes had a lyre in his hands, which
many credible writers aſſure us, ſounded when the riſing ſun ſhone upon it. Some philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
have ſuppoſed that the ſun's light poſſeſſes a mechanical impulſe, and that the ſounds
abovementioned might be thence produced. Mr. Michell conſtructed a very tender hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
balance, as related by Dr. Prieſtley in his hiſtory of light and colours, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
but ſome experiments with this balance which I ſaw made by the late Dr. Powel,
who threw the focus of a large reflector on one extremity of it, were not concluſive
eitherway, as the copper leaf of the balance approached in one experiment and receded
in another.</p>
                     <p>There are however methods by which either a rotative or alternating motion may be
produced by very moderate degrees of heat. If a ſtraight glaſs tube, ſuch as are uſed for
barometers, be ſuſpended horizontally before a fire, like a roaſting ſpit, it will revolve by
intervals; for as glaſs is a bad conductor of heat the ſide next the fire becomes heated
ſooner than the oppoſite ſide, and the tube becomes bent into a bow with the external
part of the curve towards the fire, this curve then falls down and produces a fourth part
of a revolution of the glaſs tube, which thus revolves with intermediate pauſes.</p>
                     <p>Another alternating motion I have ſeen produced by ſuſpending a glaſs tube about eight
inches long with bulbs at each end on a centre like a ſcale beam. This curious machine
is filled about one third part with pureſt ſpirit of wine, the other two thirds being a
vacuum, and is called a pulſe-glaſs, if it be placed in a box before the fire, ſo that either
bulb, as it riſes, may become ſhaded from the fire, and expoſed to it when it deſcends, an
alternate libration of it is produced. For ſpirit of wine in vacuo emits ſteam by a very
ſmall degree of heat, and this ſteam forces the ſpirit beneath it up into the upper bulb,
which therefore deſcends. It is probable ſuch a machine on a larger ſcale might be of
uſe to open the doors or windows of hot-houſes or mellon-frames, when the air within
them ſhould become too much heated, or might be employed in more important me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>On travelling through a hot ſummer's day in a chaiſe with a box covered with leather
on the fore-axle-tree, I obſerved, as the ſun ſhone upon the black leather, the box began
to open its lid, which at noon roſe above a foot, and could not without great force be
preſſed down; and which gradually cloſed again as the ſun declined in the evening. This
I ſuppoſe might with ſtill greater facility be applied to the purpoſe of opening melon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frames
or the ſaſhes of hot-houſes.</p>
                     <p>The ſtatue of Memnon was overthrown and ſawed in two by Cambyſes to diſcover
its internal ſtructure, and is ſaid ſtill to exiſt. See Savary's Letters on Egypt. The trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
ſtatue is ſaid for many centuries to have ſaluted the riſing ſun with chearful tones,
and the ſetting ſun with melancholy ones.</p>

                     <p>THERE are eighteen ſpecies of Lampyris or glow-worm, according to Linneus,
ſome of which are found in almoſt every part of the world. In many of the ſpecies
the females have no wings, and are ſuppoſed to be diſcovered by the winged males by
their ſhining in the night. They become much more lucid when they put themſelves
in motion, which would ſeem to indicate that their light is owing to their reſpiration; in
which proceſs it is probable phoſphoric acid is produced by the combination of vital air
with ſome part of the blood, and that light is given out through their tranſparent bodies
by this ſlow internal combuſtion.</p>
                     <p>There is a fire-fly of the beetle-kind deſcribed in the Dict. Raiſonné under the name
of Acudia, which is ſaid to be two inches long, and inhabits the Weſt-Indies and South
America; the natives uſe them inſtead of candles, putting from one to three of them
under a glaſs. Madam Merian ſays, that at Surinam the light of this fly is ſo great,
that ſhe ſaw ſufficiently well by one of them to paint and finiſh one of the figures of
them in her work on inſects. The largeſt and oldeſt of them are ſaid to become four
inches long, and to ſhine like a ſhooting ſtar as they fly, and are thence called Lantern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers.
The uſe of this light to the inſect itſelf ſeems to be that it may not fly againſt
objects in the night; by which contrivance theſe inſects are enabled to procure their
ſuſtenance either by night or day, as their wants may require, or their numerous enemies
permit them; whereas ſome of our beetles have eyes adapted only to the night, and if
they happen to come abroad too ſoon in the evening are ſo dazzled that they fly againſt
every thing in their way. See note on Phoſphorus, No. X.</p>
                     <p>In ſome ſeas, as particularly about the coaſt of Malabar, as a ſhip floats along, it ſeems
during the night to be ſurrounded with fire, and to leave a long tract of light behind it.
Whenever the ſea is gently agitated it ſeems converted into little ſtars, every drop as it
breaks emits light, like bodies electrified in the dark. Mr. Bomare ſays, that when he
was at the port of Cettes in Languedoc, and bathing with a companion in the ſea after
a very hot day, they both appeared covered with fire after every immerſion, and that
laying his wet hand on the arm of his companion, who had not then dipped himſelf, the
exact mark of his hand and fingers was ſeen in characters of fire. As numerous micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopic
inſects are found in this ſhining water, its light has been generally aſcribed to
them, though it ſeems probable that fiſh-ſlime in hot countries may become in ſuch a
ſtate of incipient putrefaction as to give light, eſpecially when by agitation it is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the air; otherwiſe it is not eaſy to explain why agitation ſhould be neceſſary to
produce this marine light. See note on Phoſphorus No. X.</p>

                     <p>KUNCKEL, a native of Hamburgh, was the firſt who diſcovered to the world
the proceſs for producing phoſphorus; though Brandt and Boyle were likewiſe ſaid to
have previouſly had the art of making it. It was obtained from ſal microcoſmicum by
evaporation in the form of an acid, but has ſince been found in other animal ſubſtances,
as in the aſhes of bones, and even in ſome vegetables, as in wheat flour. Keir's chemical
Dict. This phoſphoric acid is like all other acids united with vital air, and requires
to be treated with charcoal or phlogiſton to deprive it of this air, it then becomes a kind
of animal ſulphur, but of ſo inflammable a nature, that on the acceſs of air it takes fire
ſpontaneouſly, and as it burns becomes again united with vital air, and re-aſſumes its
form of phoſphoric acid.</p>
                     <p>As animal reſpiration ſeems to be a kind of ſlow combuſtion, in which it is probable
that pboſphoric acid is produced by the union of phoſphorus with the vital air, ſo it is
alſo probable that phoſphoric acid is produced in the excretory or reſpiratory veſſels of
luminous inſects, as the glow-worm and fire-fly, and ſome marine inſects. From the
ſame principle I ſuppoſe the light from putrid fiſh, as from the heads of hadocks, and
from putrid veal, and from rotten wood in a certain ſtate of their putrefaction, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and phoſphorus thus ſlowly combined with air is changed into phoſphoric acid.
The light from the Bolognian ſtone, and from calcined ſhells, and from white paper,
and linen after having been expoſed for a time to the ſun's light, ſeem to produce either
the phoſphoric or ſome other kind of acid from the ſulphurous or phlogiſtic matter
which they contain. See note on Beccari's ſhells. l. 180.</p>
                     <p>There is another proceſs ſeems ſimilar to this ſlow combuſtion, and that is <hi>bleaching.</hi> By the warmth and light of the ſun the water ſprinkled upon linen or cotton cloth ſeems
to be decompoſed, (if we credit the theory of M. Lavoiſier,) and a part of the vital air
thus ſet at liberty and uncombined and not being in its elaſtic form, more eaſily diſſolves
the colouring or phlogiſtic matter of the cloth, and produces a new acid, which is itſelf
colourleſs, or is waſhed out of the cloth by water. The new proceſs of bleaching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
a part of this theory, for by uniting much vital air to marine acid by diſtilling it
from manganeſe, on dipping the cloth to be bleached in water repleat with this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aerated
marine acid, the colouring matter diſappears immediately, ſooner indeed in cotton

                     <p>There is another proceſs which I ſuſpect bears analogy to theſe above-mentioned,
and that is the rancidity of animal fat, as of bacon; if bacon be hung up in a warm
kitchen, with much ſalt adhering on the outſide of it, the fat part of it ſoon becomes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0811300400:249"/>
yellow and rancid; if it be waſhed with much cold water after it has imbibed the ſalt,
and juſt before it is hung up, I am well informed, that it will not become rancid, or in
very ſlight degrees. In the former caſe I imagine the ſalt on the ſurface of the bacon
attracts water during the cold of the night, which is evaporated during the day, and
that in this evaporation a part of the water becomes decompoſed, as in bleaching, and its
vital air uniting with greater facility in its unelaſtic ſtate with the animal fat, produces
an acid, perhaps of the phoſphoric kind, which being of a fixed nature lies upon the
bacon, giving it the yellow colour and rancid taſte. It is remarkable that the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aerated
marine acid does not bleach living animal ſubſtances, at leaſt it did not whiten a
part of my hand which I for ſome minutes expoſed to it.</p>

                     <p>THE expanſive force of ſteam was known in ſome degree to the antients, Hero of
Alexandria deſcribes an application of it to produce a rotative motion by the re-action of
ſteam iſſuing from a ſphere mounted upon an axis, through two ſmall tubes bent into
tangents, and iſſuing from the oppoſite ſides of the equatorial diameter of the ſphere,
the ſphere was ſupplied with ſteam by a pipe communicating with a pan of boiling water,
and entering the ſphere at one of its poles.</p>
                     <p>A french writer about the year 1630 deſcribes a method of raiſing water to the upper
part of a houſe by filling a chamber with ſteam, and ſuffering it to condenſe of itſelf, but
it ſeems to have been mere theory, as his method was ſcarcely practicable as he deſcribes
it. In 1655 the Marquis of Worceſter mentions a method of raiſing water by fire in his
Century of Inventions, but he ſeems only to have availed himſelf of the expanſive force
and not to have known the advantages ariſing from condenſing the ſteam by an injection
of cold water. This latter and moſt important improvement ſeems to have been made
by Capt. Savery ſometime prior to 1698, for in that year his patent for the uſe of that
invention was confirmed by act of parliament. This gentleman appears to have been the
firſt who reduced the machine to practice and exhibited it in an uſeful form. This
method conſiſted only in expelling the air from a veſſel by ſteam and condenſing the
ſteam by an injection of cold water, which making a vacuum, the preſſure of the atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere
forced the water to aſcend into the ſteam-veſſel through a pipe of 24 to 26 feet
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0811300400:250"/>
high, and by the admiſſion of denſe ſteam from the boiler, forcing the water in the ſteam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſel
to aſcend to the height deſired. This conſtruction was defective becauſe it required
very ſtrong veſſels to reſiſt the force of the ſteam, and becauſe an enormous quantity of
ſteam was condenſed by coming in contact with the cold water in the ſteam-veſſel.</p>
                     <p>About or ſoon after that time M. Papin attempted a ſteam-engine on ſimilar principles
but rather more defective in its conſtruction.</p>
                     <p>The next improvement was made very ſoon afterwards by Meſſrs. Newcomen and
Cawley of Dartmouth, it conſiſted in employing for the ſteam-veſſel a hollow cylinder,
ſhut at bottom and open at top, furniſhed with a piſton ſliding eaſily up and down in it,
and made tight by oakum or hemp, and covered with water. This piſton is ſuſpended
by chains from one end of a beam, moveable upon an axis in the middle of its length,
to the other end of this beam are ſuſpended the pump-rods.</p>
                     <p>The danger of burſting the veſſels was avoided in this machine, as however high the
water was to be raiſed it was not neceſſary to increaſe the denſity of the ſteam but only
to enlarge the diameter of the cylinder.</p>
                     <p>Another advantage was, that the cylinder not being made ſo cold as in Savary's
method, much leſs ſteam was loſt in filling it after each condenſation.</p>
                     <p>The machine however ſtill remained imperfect, for the cold water thrown into the
cylinder acquired heat from the ſteam it condenſed, and being in a veſſel exhauſted of
air it produced ſteam itſelf, which in part reſiſted the action of the atmoſphere on the
piſton; were this remedied by throwing in more cold water the deſtruction of ſteam in
the next filling of the cylinder would be proportionally increaſed. It has therefore in
practice been found adviſeable not to load theſe engines with columns of water weighing
more than ſeven pounds for each ſquare inch of the area of the piſton. The bulk of
water when converted into ſteam remained unknown until Mr. J. Watt, then of
Glaſgow, in 1764, determined it to be about 1800 times more rare than water. It ſoon
occurred to Mr. Watt that a perfect engine would be that in which no ſteam ſhould be
condenſed in filling the cylinder, and in which the ſteam ſhould be ſo perfectly cooled as
to produce nearly a perfect vacuum.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Watt having aſcertained the degree of heat in which water boiled in vacuo, and
under progreſſive degrees of preſſure, and inſtructed by Dr. Black's diſcovery of latent
heat, having calculated the quantity of cold water neceſſary to condenſe certain quantities
of ſteam ſo far as to produce the exhauſtion required, he made a communication from
the cylinder to a cold veſſel previouſly exhauſted of air and water, into which the ſteam
ruſhed by its elaſticity, and became immediately condenſed. He then adapted a cover to
the cylinder and admitted ſteam above the piſton to preſs it down inſtead of air, and
inſtead of applying water he uſed oil or greaſe to fill the pores of the oakum and to lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the cylinder.</p>
                     <p>He next applied a pump to extract the injection water, the condenſed ſteam, and the
air, from the condenſing veſſel, every ſtroke of the engine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0811300400:251"/>
To prevent the cooling of the cylinder by the contact of the external air, he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
it with a caſe containing ſteam, which he again protected by a covering of
matters which conduct heat ſlowly.</p>
                     <p>This conſtruction preſented an eaſy means of regulating the power of the engine, for
the ſteam being the acting power, as the pipe which admits it from the boiler is more
or leſs opened, a greater or ſmaller quantity can enter during the time of a ſtroke, and
conſequently the engine can act with exactly the neceſſary degree of energy.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Watt gained a patent for his engine in 1768, but the further perſecution of his
deſigns were delayed by other avocations till 1775, when in conjunction with Mr. Boulton
of Soho near Birmingham, numerous experiments were made on a large ſcale by their
united ingenuity, and great improvements added to the machinery, and an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
obtained for the prolongation of their patent for twenty-five years, they have ſince
that time drained many of the deep mines in Cornwall, which but for the happy union
of ſuch genius muſt immediately have ceaſed to work. One of theſe engines works a
pump of eighteen inches diameter, and upwards of 100 fathom or 600 feet high, at the
rate of ten to twelve ſtrokes of ſeven feet long each, in a minute, and that with one fifth
part of the coals which a common engine would have taken to do the ſame work. The
power of this engine may be eaſier comprehended by ſaying that it raiſed a weight equal
to 81000 pounds 80 feet high in a minute, which is equal to the combined action of 200
good horſes. In Newcomen's engine this would have required a cylinder of the
enormous diameter of 120 inches or ten feet, but as in this engine of Mr. Watt and
Mr. Boulton the ſteam acts, and a vacuum is made, alternately above and below the
piſton, the power exerted is double to what the ſame cylinder would otherways pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
and is further augmented by an inequality in the length of the two ends of the
lever.</p>
                     <p>Theſe gentlemen have alſo by other contrivances applied their engines to the turning
of mills for almoſt every purpoſe, of which that great pile of machinery the Albion
Mill is a well known inſtance. Forges, ſlitting mills, and other great works are erected
where nature has furniſhed no running water, and future times may boaſt that this
grand and uſeful engine was invented and perfected in our own country.</p>
                     <p>Since the above article went to the preſs the Albion Mill is no more; it is ſuppoſed
to have been ſet on fire by intereſted or malicious incendaries, and is burnt to the
ground. Whence London has loſt the credit and the advantage of poſſeſſing the

                     <p>THE cauſe of the expanſion of water during its converſion into ice is not yet well
aſcertained, it was ſuppoſed to have been owing to the air being ſet at liberty in the act
of congelation which was before diſſolved in the water, and the many air bubbles in ice
were thought to countenance this opinion. But the great force with which ice expands
during its congelation, ſo as to burſt iron bombs and coehorns, according to the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Major Williams at Quebec, invalidates this idea of the cauſe of it, and may
ſometime be brought into uſe as a means of breaking rocks in mining, or projecting
cannon-balls, or for other mechanical purpoſes, if the means of producing congelation
ſhould ever be diſcovered to be as eaſy as the means of producing combuſtion.</p>
                     <p>Mr. de Mairan attributes the increaſe of bulk of frozen water to the different arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the particles of it in cryſtallization, as they are conſtantly joined at an angle of
60 degrees; and muſt by this diſpoſition he thinks occupy a greater volume than if they
were parallel. He found the augmentation of the water during freezing to amount to
one-fourteenth, one-eighteenth, one-nineteenth, and when the water was previouſly
purged of air to only one-twenty-ſecond part. He adds that a piece of ice, which was
at firſt only one-fourteenth part ſpecifically lighter than water, on being expoſed ſome
days to the froſt became one-twelfth lighter than water. Hence he thinks ice by being
expoſed to greater cold ſtill increaſes in volume, and to this attributes the burſting of ice
in ponds and on the glaciers. See Lewis's Commerce of Arts, p. 257. and the note on
Muſchus in the other volume of this work.</p>
                     <p>This expanſion of ice well accounts for the greater miſchief done by vernal froſts at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with moiſture, (as by hoar-froſts,) than by the dry froſts called black froſts. Mr.
Lawrence in a letter to Mr. Bradley complains that the dale-miſt attended with a froſt on
may-day had deſtroyed all his tender fruits; though there was a ſharper froſt the night
before without a miſt, that did him no injury; and adds, that a garden not a ſtone's
throw from his own on a higher ſituation, being above the dale-miſt, had received no
damage. Bradley, Vol. II. p. 232.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Hunter by very curious experiments diſcovered that the living principle in fiſh,
in vegetables, and even in eggs and ſeeds, poſſeſſes a power of reſiſting congelation.
Phil. Tranſ. There can be no doubt but that the exertions of animals to avoid
the pain of cold may produce in them a greater quantity of heat, at leaſt for a time,
but that vegetables, eggs, or ſeeds, ſhould poſſeſs ſuch a quality is truly wonderful.
Others have imagined that animals poſſeſs a power of preventing themſelves from becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much warmer than 98 degrees of heat, when immerſed in an atmoſphere above that
degree of heat. It is true that the increaſed exhalation from their bodies will in ſome
meaſure cool them, as much heat is carried off by the evaporation of fluids, but this
is a chemical not an animal proceſs. The experiments made by thoſe who continued
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0811300400:253"/>
many minutes in the air of a room heated ſo much above any natural atmoſpheric heat,
do not ſeem concluſive, as they remained in it a leſs time than would have been neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to have heated a maſs of beef of the ſame magnitude, and the circulation of the blood
in living animals, by perpetually bringing new ſupplies of fluid to the ſkin, would prevent
the external ſurface from becoming hot much ſooner than the whole maſs. And thirdly,
there appears no power of animal bodies to produce cold in diſeaſes, as in ſcarlet fever, in
which the increaſed action of the veſſels of the ſkin produces heat and contributes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt
the animal power already too much weakened.</p>
                     <p>It has been thought by many that froſts meliorate the ground, and that they are in
general ſalubrious to mankind. In reſpect to the former it is now well known that ice or
ſnow contain no nitrous particles, and though froſt by enlarging the bulk of moiſt clay
leaves it ſofter for a time after the thaw, yet as ſoon as the water exhales, the clay becomes
as hard as before, being preſſed together by the incumbent atmoſphere, and by its ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attraction,
called <hi>ſetting</hi> by the potters. Add to this that on the coaſts of Africa, where
froſt is unknown, the fertility of the ſoil is almoſt beyond our conceptions of it. In
reſpect to the general ſalubrity of froſty ſeaſons the bills of mortality are an evidence in
the negative, as in long froſts many weakly and old people periſh from debility occaſioned
by the cold, and many claſſes of birds and other wild animals are benumbed by the cold
or deſtroyed by the conſequent ſcarcity of food, and many tender vegetables periſh from
the degree of cold.</p>
                     <p>I do not think it ſhould be objected to this doctrine that there are moiſt days attended
with a briſk cold wind when no viſible ice appears, and which are yet more diſagreeable
and deſtructive than froſty weather. For on theſe days the cold moiſture, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
on the ſkin is there evaporated and thus produces a degree of cold perhaps greater
than the milder froſts. Whence even in ſuch days both the diſagreeable ſenſations and
inſalubrious effects belong to the cauſe abovementioned, viz. the intenſity of the cold.
Add to this that in theſe cold moiſt days as we paſs along or as the wind blows upon us,
a new ſheet of cold water is as it were perpetually applied to us and hangs upon our
bodies, now as water is 800 times denſer than air and is a much better conductor of heat,
we are ſtarved with cold like thoſe who go into a cold bath, both by the great number of
particles in contact with the ſkin and their greater facility of receiving our heat.</p>
                     <p>It may nevertheleſs be true that ſnows of long duration in our winters may be leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to vegetation than great rains and ſhorter froſts, for two reaſons. 1. Becauſe great
rains carry down many thouſand pounds worth of the beſt part of the manure off the lands
into the ſea, whereas ſnow diſſolves more gradually and thence carries away leſs from the
land; any one may diſtinguiſh a ſnow-flood from a rain-flood by the tranſparency of the
water. Hence hills or fields with conſiderable inclination of ſurface ſhould be ploughed
horizontally that the furrows may ſtay the water from ſhowers till it depoſits its mud.
2. Snow protects vegetables from the ſeverity of the froſt, ſince it is always in a ſtate of
thaw where it is in contact with the earth; as the earth's heat is about 48° and the heat of
thawing ſnow is 32° the vegetables between them are kept in a degree of heat about 40,
by which many of them are preſerved. See note on Muſchus, Vol. II. of this work.</p>

                        <p>THERE was an idle diſpute whether knobs or points were preferable on the top of
conductors for the defence of houſes. The deſign of theſe conductors is to permit the
electric matter accumulated in the clouds to paſs through them into the earth in a ſmaller
continued ſtream as the cloud approaches, before it comes to what is termed ſtriking
diſtance; now as it is well known that accumulated electricity will paſs to points at a
much greater diſtance than it will to knobs there can be no doubt of their preference;
and it would ſeem that the finer the point and the leſs liable to become ruſty the better,
as it would take off the lightening while it was ſtill at a greater diſtance, and by that
means preſerve a greater extent of building; the very extremity of the point ſhould be of
pure ſilver or gold, and might be branched into a kind of bruſh, ſince one ſmall point can
not be ſuppoſed to receive ſo great a quantity as a thicker bar might conduct into the
earth.</p>
                        <p>If an inſulated metallic ball is armed with a point, like a needle, projecting from one
part of it, the electric fluid will be ſeen in the dark to paſs off from this point, ſo long as
the ball is kept ſupplied with electricity. The reaſon of this is not difficult to comprehend,
every part of the electric atmoſphere which ſurrounds the inſulated ball is attracted to
that ball by a large ſurface of it, whereas the electric atmoſphere which is near the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of the needle is attracted to it by only a ſingle point, in conſequence the particles
of electric matter near the ſurface of the ball approach towards it and puſh off by their
greater gravitation the particles of electric matter over the point of the needle in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſtream.</p>
                        <p>Something like this happens in reſpect to the diffuſion of oil on water from a pointed
cork, an experiment which was many years ago ſhewn me by Dr. Franklin; he cut a
piece of cork about the ſize of a letter-wafer and left on one edge of it a point about a
ſixth of an inch in length projecting as a tangent to the circumference. This was dipped
in oil and thrown on a pond of water and continued to revolve as the oil left the point
for a great many minutes. The oil deſcends from the floating cork upon the water
being diffuſed upon it without friction and perhaps without contact; but its going off at
the point ſo forcibly as to make the cork revolve in a contrary direction ſeems analogous
to the departure of the electric fluid from points.</p>
                        <p>Can any thing ſimilar to either of theſe happen in reſpect to the earth's atmoſphere

                        <head>FAIRY-RINGS.</head>
                        <p>There is a phenomenon ſuppoſed to be electric which is yet unaccounted for, I
mean the Fairy-rings, as they are called, ſo often ſeen on the graſs. The numerous
flaſhes of lightning which occur every ſummer are, I believe, generally diſcharged on
the earth, and but ſeldom (if ever) from one cloud to another. Moiſt trees are the
moſt frequent conductors of theſe flaſhes of lightning, and I am informed by purchaſers
of wood that innumerable trees are thus cracked and injured. At other times larger
parts or prominences of clouds gradually ſinking as they move along, are diſcharged on
the moiſture parts of graſſy plains. Now this knob or corner of a cloud in being
attracted by the earth will become nearly cylindrical, as looſe wool would do when
drawn out into a thread, and will ſtrike the earth with a ſtream of electricity perhaps
two or ten yards in diameter. Now as a ſtream of electricity diſplaces the air it paſſes
through, it is plain no part of the graſs can be burnt by it, but juſt the external ring of
this cylinder where the graſs can have acceſs to the air, ſince without air nothing can be
calcined. This earth after having been ſo calcined becomes a richer ſoil, and either fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſes
or a bluer graſs for many years mark the place. That lightning diſplaces the air in
its paſſage is evinced by the loud crack that ſucceeds it, which is owing to the ſides of the
aerial vacuum clapping together when the lightning is withdrawn. That nothing will
calcine without air is now well underſtood from the acids produced in the burning of
phlogiſtic ſubſtances, and may be agreeably ſeen by ſuſpending a paper on an iron prong
and putting it into the centre of the blaze of an iron-furnace; it may be held there
ſome ſeconds and may be again withdrawn without its being burnt, if it be paſſed
quickly into the flame and out again through the external part of it which is in contact
with the air. I know ſome circles of many yards diameter of this kind near Foremark
in Derbyſhire which annually produce large white funguſes and ſtronger graſs, and
have done ſo, I am informed, above thirty years. This increaſed fertility of the ground
by calcination or charring, and its continuing to operate ſo many years is well worth the
attention of the farmer, and ſhews the uſe of paring and burning new turf in agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture,
which produces its effect not ſo much by the aſhes of the vegetable fibres as by
charring the ſoil which adheres to them.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſituations, whether from eminence or from moiſture, which were proper once
to attract and diſcharge a thunder-cloud, are more liable again to experience the ſame.
Hence many fairy-rings are often ſeen near each other either without interſecting each
other, as I ſaw this ſummer in a garden in Nottinghamſhire, or interſecting each other
as deſcribed on Arthur's ſeat near Edinburgh in the Edinb. Tranſ. Vol. II. p. 3.</p>

                     <p>A TREE is properly ſpeaking a family or ſwarm of buds, each bud being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
plant, for if one of theſe buds be torn or cut out and planted in the earth with
a glaſs cup inverted over it to prevent its exhalation from being at firſt greater than its
power of abſorption, it will produce a tree ſimilar to its parent; each bud has a leaf,
which is its lungs, appropriated to it, and the bark of the tree is a congeries of the roots
of theſe individual buds, whence old hollow trees are often ſeen to have ſome branches
flouriſh with vigour after the internal wood is almoſt intirely decayed and vaniſhed.
According to this idea Linneus has obſerved that trees and ſhrubs are roots above
ground, for if a tree be inverted leaves will grow from the root-part and roots from the
trunk-part. Phil. Bot. p. 39. Hence it appears that vegetables have two methods of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
themſelves, the oviparous as by ſeeds, and the viviparous as by their buds and
bulbs, and that the individual plants, whether from ſeeds or buds or bulbs, are all annual
productions like many kinds of inſects as the ſilk-worm, the parent periſhing in the
autumn after having produced an embryon, which lies in a torpid ſtate during the winter,
and is matured in the ſucceeding ſummer. Hence Linneus names buds and bulbs the
winter-cradles of the plant or hybernacula, and might have given the ſame term to
ſeeds. In warm climates few plants produce buds, as the vegetable life can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
in one ſummer, and hence the hybernacle is not wanted; in cold climates alſo
ſome plants do not produce buds, as philadelphus, ſrangula, viburnum, ivy, heath,
wood-nightſhade, rue, geranium.</p>
                     <p>The bulbs of plants are another kind of winter-cradle, or hybernacle, adhering to
the deſcending trunk, and are found in the perennial herbaceous plants which are too
tender to bear the cold of the winter. The production of theſe ſubterraneous winter
lodges, is not yet perhaps clearly underſtood, they have been diſtributed by Linneus
according to their forms into ſcaly, ſolid, coated, and jointed bulbs, which however
does not elucidate their manner of production. As the buds of trees may be truly
eſteemed individual annual plants, their roots conſtituting the bark of the tree, it follows
that theſe roots (viz. of each individual bud) ſpread themſelves over the laſt years bark,
making a new bark over the old one, and thence deſcending cover with a new bark the
old roots alſo in the ſame manner. A ſimilar circumſtance I ſuppoſe to happen in
ſome herbaceous plants, that is, a new bark is annually produced over the old root, and
thus for ſome years at leaſt the old root or caudex increaſes in ſize and puts up new
ſtems. As theſe roots increaſe in ſize the central part I ſuppoſe changes like the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
wood of a tree and does not poſſeſs any vegetable life, and therefore gives out no
fibres or rootlets, and hence appears bitten off, as in valerian, plantain, and devil's-bit.
And this decay of the central part of the root I ſuppoſe has given occaſion to the belief
of the root-fibres drawing down the bulb ſo much inſiſted on by Mr. Milne in his
Botanical Dictionary, Art. Bulb.</p>

From the obſervations and drawings of various kinds of bulbous roots at different
times of their growth, ſent me by a young lady of nice obſervation, it appears probable
that all bulbous roots properly ſo called periſh annually in this climate: Bradley, Miller,
and the Author of Spectacle de la Nature, obſerve that the tulip annually renews its
bulb, for the ſtalk of the old flower is found under the old dry coat but on the outſide
of the new bulb. This large new bulb is the flowering bulb, but beſides this there are
other ſmall new bulbs produced between the coats of this large one but from the
ſame caudex, (or circle from which the root-fibres ſpring;) theſe ſmall bulbs are
leaf-bearing bulbs, and renew themſelves annually with increaſing ſize till they bear
flowers.</p>
                     <p>Miſs—favoured me with the following curious experiment: She took a ſmall
tulip-root out of the earth when the green leaves were ſufficiently high to ſhow the
flower, and placed it in a glaſs of water; the leaves and flower ſoon withered and the
bulb became wrinkled and ſoft, but put out one ſmall ſide bulb and three bulbs beneath
deſcending an inch into the water by long proceſſes from the caudex, the old bulb in ſome
weeks intirely decayed; on diſſecting this monſter, the middle deſcending bulb was found
by its proceſs to adhere to the caudex and to the old flower-ſtem, and the ſide ones
were ſeparated from the flower-ſtem by a few ſhrivelled coats but adhered to the caudex.
Whence ſhe concludes that theſe laſt were off-ſets or leaf-bulbs which ſhould have been
ſeen between the coats of the new flower-bulb if it had been left to grow in the earth,
and that the middle one would have been the new flower-bulb. In ſome years (perhaps
in wet ſeaſons) the floriſts are ſaid to loſe many of their tulip-roots by a ſimilar proceſs,
the new leaf-bulbs being produced beneath the old ones by an elongation of the caudex
without any new flower-bulbs.</p>
                     <p>By repeated diſſections ſhe obſerves that the leaf-bulbs or off-ſets of tulip, crocus,
gladiolus, fritillary, are renewed in the ſame manner as the flowering-bulbs, contrary to
the opinion of many writers; this new leaf-bulb is formed on the inſide of the coats
from whence the leaves grow, and is more or leſs advanced in ſize as the outer coats and
leaves are more or leſs ſhrivelled. In examining tulip, iris, hyacinth, hare-bell, the new
bulb was invariably found <hi>between</hi> the flower-ſtem and the baſe of the innermoſt leaf of
thoſe roots which had flowered, and <hi>incloſed by</hi> the baſe of the innermoſt leaf in thoſe
roots which had not flowered, in both caſes adhering to the caudex or fleſhy circle from
which the root-fibres ſpring.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is probable that the bulbs of hyacinths are renewed annually, but that this
is performed from the caudex within the old bulb, the outer coat of which does not ſo
ſhrivel as in crocus and fritillary and hence this change is not ſo apparent. But I
believe as ſoon as the flower is advanced the new bulbs may be ſeen on diſſection, nor
does the annual increaſe of the ſize of the root of cyclamen and of aletris capenſis mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
againſt this annual renewal of them, ſince the leaf-bulbs or off-ſets, as deſcribed
above, are increaſed in ſize as they are annually renewed. See note on orchis, and on
anthoxanthum, in Vol. II. of this work.</p>

                     <p>DR. ALEXANDER WILSON, Profeſſor of Aſtronomy at Glaſgow, publiſhed
a paper in the Philoſophical Tranſactions for 1774, demonſtrating that the ſpots in the
ſun's diſk are real cavities, excavations through the luminous material, which covers the
other parts of the ſun's ſurface. One of theſe cavities he found to be about 4000 miles
deep and many times as wide. Some objections were made to this doctrine by M. De
la Laude in the Memoirs of the French Academy for the year 1776, which however
have been ably anſwered by Profeſſor Wilſon in reply in the Philoſ. Tranſ, for 1783.
Keil obſerves, in his Aſtronomical Lectures, p. 44, <q>We frequently ſee ſpots in the
ſun which are larger and broader not only than Europe or Africa, but which even equal,
if they do not exceed, the ſurface of the whole terraqueous globe.</q> Now that theſe
cavities are made in the ſun's body by a proceſs of nature ſimilar to our earthquakes
does not ſeem improbable on ſeveral accounts. 1. Becauſe from this diſcovery of Dr.
Wilſon it appears that the internal parts of the ſun are not in a ſtate of inflammation or
of ejecting light, like the external part or luminous ocean which covers it; and hence
that a greater degree of heat or inflammation and conſequent expanſion or exploſion
may occaſionally be produced in its internal or dark nucleus. 2. Becauſe the ſolar ſpots
or cavities are frequently increaſed or diminiſhed in ſize. 3. New ones are often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
4. And old ones vaniſh. 5. Becauſe there are brighter or more luminous parts
of the ſun's diſk, called faculae by Scheiner and Hevelius, which would ſeem to be vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canos
in the ſun, or, as Dr. Wilſon calls them, <q>eructations of matter more luminous
than that which covers the ſun's ſurface.</q> 6. To which may be added that all the
planets added together with their ſatellites do not amount to more than one ſix hundred
and fiftieth part of the maſs of the ſun according to Sir Iſaac Newton.</p>
                     <p>Now if it could be ſuppoſed that the planets were originally thrown out of the ſun
by larger ſun-quakes than thoſe frequent ones which occaſion theſe ſpots or excavations
above-mentioned, what would happen? I. According to the obſervations and opinion
of Mr. Herſchel the ſun itſelf and all its planets are moving forwards round ſome other
centre with an unknown velocity, which may be of opake matter correſponding with the
very antient and general idea of a chaos. Whence if a ponderous planet, as Saturn,
could be ſuppoſed to be projected from the ſun by an exploſion, the motion of the ſun
itſelf might be at the ſame time diſturbed in ſuch a manner as to prevent the planet
from falling again into it. 2. As the ſun revolves round its own axis its form muſt
be that of an oblate ſpheroid like the earth, and therefore a body projected from its
ſurface perpendicularly upwards from that ſurface would not riſe perpendicularly from
the ſun's centre, unleſs it happened to be projected exactly from either of its poles or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0811300400:259"/>
from its equator. Whence it may not be neceſſary that a planet if thus projected from
the ſun by exploſion ſhould again fall into the ſun. 3. They would part from the ſun's
ſurface with the velocity with which that ſurface was moving, and with the velocity
acquired by the exploſion, and would therefore move round the ſun in the ſame direction
in which the ſun rotates on its axis, and perform eliptic orbits. 4. All the planets would
move the ſame way round the ſun, from this firſt motion acquired at leaving its ſurface,
but their orbits would be inclined to each other according to the diſtance of the part,
where they were thrown out, from the ſun's equator. Hence thoſe which were ejected
near the ſun's equator would have orbits but little inclined to each other, as the primary
planets; the plain of all whoſe orbits are inclined but ſeven degrees and a half from each
other. Others which were ejected near the ſun's poles would have much more eccentric
orbits, as they would partake ſo much leſs of the ſun's rotatory motion at the time they
parted from his ſurface, and would therefore be carried further from the ſun by the
velocity they had gained by the exploſion which ejected them, and become comets.
5. They would all obey the ſame laws of motion in their revolutions round the ſun;
this has been determined by aſtronomers, who have demonſtrated that they move through
equal areas in equal times. 6. As their annual periods would depend on the height they
roſe by the exploſion, theſe would differ in them all. 7. As their diurnal revolutions
would depend on one ſide of the exploded matter adhering more than the other at the
time it was torn off by the exploſion, theſe would alſo differ in the different planets, and
not bear any proportion to their annual periods. Now as all theſe circumſtances coincide
with the known laws of the planetary ſyſtem, they ſerve to ſtrengthen this conjecture.</p>
                     <p>This coincidence of ſuch a variety of circumſtances induced M. de Buffon to ſuppoſe
that the planets were all ſtruck off from the ſun's ſurface by the impact of a large comet,
ſuch as approached ſo near the ſun's diſk, and with ſuch amazing velocity, in the year
1680, and is expected to return in 2255. But Mr. Buffon did not recollect that theſe
comets themſelves are only planets with more eccentric orbits, and that therefore it muſt
be aſked, what had previouſly ſtruck off theſe comets from the ſun's body? 2. That if
all theſe planets were ſtruck off from the ſun at the ſame time, they muſt have been ſo
near as to have attracted each other and have formed one maſs: 3. That we ſhall want
new cauſes for ſeparating the ſecondary planets from the primary ones, and muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
look out for ſome other agent, as it does not appear how the impulſe of a comet
could have made one planet roll round another at the time they both of them were
driven off from the ſurface of the ſun.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhould be aſked, why new planets are not frequently ejected from the ſun? it
may be anſwered, that after many large earthquakes many vents are left for the elaſtic
vapours to eſcape, and hence, by the preſent appearance of the ſurface of our earth,
earthquakes prodigiouſly larger than any recorded in hiſtory have exiſted; the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
may have affected the ſun, on whoſe ſurface there are appearances of vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canos,
as deſcribed above. Add to this, that ſome of the comets, and even the georgium
ſidus, may, for ought we know to the contrary, have been emitted from the ſun in more
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0811300400:260"/>
modern days, and have been diverted from their courſe, and thus prevented from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
into the ſun, by their approach to ſome of the older planets, which is ſomewhat
countenanced by the opinion ſeveral philoſophers have maintained, that the quantity of
matter of the ſun has decreaſed. Dr. Halley obſerved, that by comparing the proportion
which the periodical time of the moon bore to that of the ſun in former times, with the
proportion between them at preſent, that the moon is found to be ſomewhat accelerated
in reſpect to the ſun. Pemberton's View of Sir Iſaac Newton, p. 247. And ſo large is
the body of this mighty luminary, that all the planets thus thrown out of it would make
ſcarcely any perceptible diminution of it, as mentioned above. The cavity mentioned
above, as meaſured by Dr. Wilſon of 4000 miles in depth, not penetrating an hundredth
part of the ſun's ſemi-diameter; and yet, as its width was many times greater than its
depth, was large enough to contain a greater body than our terreſtrial world.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean to conceal, that from the laws of gravity unfolded by Sir Iſaac Newton,
ſuppoſing the ſun to be a ſphere and to have no progreſſive motion, and not liable itſelf
to be diſturbed by the ſuppoſed projection of the planets from it, that ſuch planets muſt
return into the ſun. The late Rev. William Ludlam, of Leiceſter, whoſe genius never
met with reward equal to its merits, in a letter to me, dated January, 1787, after having
ſhewn, as mentioned above, that planets ſo projected from the ſun would return to it,
adds, <q>That a body as large as the moon ſo projected, would diſturb the motion of the
earth in its orbit, is certain; but the calculation of ſuch diſturbing forces is difficult.
The body in ſome circumſtances might become a ſatellite, and both move round their
common centre of gravity, and that centre be carried in an annual orbit round the
ſun.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are other circumſtances which might have concurred at the time of ſuch ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
exploſions, which would render this idea not impoſſible. I. The planets might be
thrown out of the ſun at the time the ſun itſelf was riſing from chaos, and be attracted
by other ſuns in their vicinity riſing at the ſame time out of chaos, which would prevent
them from returning into the ſun. 2. The new planet in its courſe or aſcent from the ſun,
might explode and eject a ſatellite, or perhaps more than one, and thus by its courſe
being affected might not return into the ſun. 3. If more planets were ejected at the
ſame time from the ſun, they might attract and diſturb each others courſe at the time
they left the body of the ſun, or very ſoon afterwards, when they would be ſo much
nearer each other.</p>

                     <p>FROM having obſerved that many of the higheſt mountains of the world conſiſt of
lime-ſtone replete with ſhells, and that theſe mountains bear the marks of having been
lifted up by ſubterraneous fires from the interior parts of the globe; and as lime-ſtone
replete with ſhells is found at the bottom of many of our deepeſt mines ſome philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
have concluded that the nucleus of the earth was for many ages covered with
water which was peopled with its adapted animals; that the ſhells and bones of theſe
animals in a long ſeries of time produced ſolid ſtrata in the ocean ſurrounding the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
nucleus.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſtrata conſiſt of the accumulated exuviae of ſhell-fiſh, the animals periſhed
age after age but their ſhells remained, and in progreſſion of time produced the amazing
quantities of lime-ſtone which almoſt cover the earth. Other marine animals called
coralloids raiſed walls and even mountains by the congeries of their calcareous habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
theſe perpendicular corralline rocks make ſome parts of the Southern Ocean highly
dangerous, as appears in the journals of Capt. Cook. From contemplating the immenſe
ſtrata of lime-ſtone, both in reſpect to their extent and thickneſs, formed from theſe
ſhells of animals, philoſophers have been led to conclude that much of the water of the
ſea has been converted into calcareous earth by paſſing through their organs of digeſtion.
The formation of calcareous earth ſeems more particularly to be an animal proceſs as the
formation of clay belongs to the vegetable economy; thus the ſhells of crabs and other
teſtaceous fiſh are annually reproduced from the mucous membrane beneath them; the
ſhells of eggs are firſt a mucous membrane, and the calculi of the kidneys and thoſe
found in all other parts of our ſyſtem which ſometimes contain calcareous earth, ſeem
to originate from inflamed membranes; the bones themſelves conſiſt of calcareous earth
united with the phoſphoric or animal acid, which may be ſeparated by diſſolving the
aſhes of calcined bones in the nitrous acid; the various ſecretions of animals, as their
ſaliva and urine, abound likewiſe with calcareous earth, as appears by the incruſtations
about the teeth and the ſediments of urine. It is probable that animal mucus is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
proceſs towards the formation of calcareous earth; and that all the calcareous
earth in the world which is ſeen in lime-ſtones, marbles, ſpars, alabaſters, marls, (which
make up the greateſt part of the earth's cruſt, as far as it has yet been penetrated,) have
been formed originally by animal and vegetable bodies from the maſs of water, and that
by theſe means the ſolid part of the terraqueous globe has perpetually been in an
increaſing ſtate and the water perpetually in a decreaſing one.</p>
                     <p>After the mountains of ſhells and other recrements of aquatic animals were elevated
above the water the upper heaps of them were gradually diſſolved by rains and dews
and oozing through were either perfectly cryſtallized in ſmaller cavities and formed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0811300400:262"/>
calcareous ſpar, or were imperfectly cryſtallized on the roofs of larger cavities and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
ſtalactites; or mixing with other undiſſolved ſhells beneath them formed marbles,
which were more or leſs cryſtallized and more or leſs pure; or laſtly, after being diſſolved,
the water was exhaled from them in ſuch a manner that the external parts became ſolid,
and forming an arch prevented the internal parts from approaching each other ſo near as
to become ſolid, and thus chalk was produced. I have ſpecimens of chalk formed at the
root of ſeveral ſtalactites, and in their central parts; and of other ſtalactites which are
hollow like quills from a ſimilar cauſe, viz. from the external part of the ſtalactite harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt by its evaporation, and thus either attracting the internal diſſolved particles to
the cruſt, or preventing them from approaching each other ſo as to form a ſolid body.
Of theſe I ſaw many hanging from the arched roof of a cellar under the high ſtreet in
Edinburgh.</p>
                     <p>If this diſſolved limeſtone met with vitriolic acid it was converted into alabaſter,
parting at the ſame time with its fixable air. If it met with the fluor acid it became fluor;
if with the ſiliceous acid, flint; and when mixed with clay and ſand, or either of them,
acquires the name of marl. And under one or other of theſe forms compoſes a great
part of the ſolid globe of the earth.</p>
                     <p>Another mode in which limeſtone appears is in the form of round granulated par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
but ſlightly cohering together; of this kind a bed extends over Lincoln heath,
perhaps twenty miles long by ten wide. The form of this calcareous ſand, its angles
having been rubbed off, and the flatneſs of its bed, evinces that that part of the country
was ſo formed under water, the particles of ſand having thus been rounded, like all other
rounded pebbles. This round form of calcareous ſand and of other larger pebbles is
produced under water, partly by their being more or leſs ſoluble in water, and hence the
angular parts become diſſolved, firſt, by their expoſing a larger ſurface to the action of the
menſtruum, and ſecondly, from their attrition againſt each other by the ſtreams or tides,
for a great length of time, ſucceſſively as they were collected, and perhaps when ſome of
them had not acquired their hardeſt ſtate.</p>
                     <p>This calcareous ſand has generally been called ketton-ſtone and believed to reſemble
the ſpawn of fiſh, it has acquired a form ſo much rounder than ſiliceous ſand from its
being of ſo much ſofter a texture and alſo much more ſoluble in water. There are
other ſoft calcareous ſtones called tupha which are depoſited from water on moſſes, as at
Matlock, from which moſs it is probable the water may receive ſomething which induces
it the readier to part with its earth.</p>
                     <p>In ſome lime-ſtones the living animals ſeem to have been buried as well as their ſhells
during ſome great convulſion of nature, theſe ſhells contain a black coaly ſubſtance
within them, in others ſome phlogiſton or volatile alcali from the bodies of the dead
animals remains mixed with the ſtone, which is then called liver-ſtone as it emits a
ſulphurous ſmell on being ſtruck, and there is a ſtratum about ſix inches thick extends a
conſiderable way over the iron ore at Wingerworth near Cheſterfield in Derbyſhire
which ſeems evidently to have been formed from the ſhells of freſh-water muſcles</p>

                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0811300400:263"/>
There is however another ſource of calcareous earth beſides the aquatic one above
deſcribed and that is from the recrements of land animals and vegetables as found in
marls, which conſiſt of various mixtures of calcareous earth, ſand, and clay, all of
them perhaps principally from vegetable origin.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Hutton is of opinion that the rocks of marble have been ſoftened by fire into
a fluid maſs, which he thinks under immenſe preſſure might be done without the eſcape
of their carbonic acid or fixed air. Edinb. Tranſact. Vol. I. If this ingenious idea be
allowed it might account for the purity of ſome white marbles, as during their fluid
ſtate there might be time for their partial impurities, whether from the bodies of the
animals which produced the ſhells or from other extraneous matter, either to ſublime
to the uppermoſt part of the ſtratum or to ſubſide to the lowermoſt part of it. As a
confirmation of this theory of Dr. Hutton's it may be added that ſome calcareous
ſtones are found mixed with lime, and have thence loſt a part of their fixed air or
carbonic gas, as the bath-ſtone, and on that account hardens on being expoſed to the
air, and mixed with ſulphur produces calcareous liver of ſulphur. Falconer on Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water.

given many years ago by the Earl of Cromartie, of which the following is a ſhort
abſtract.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1651 the EARL OF CROMARTIE being then nineteen years of age ſaw a
plain in the pariſh of Lockburn covered over with a firm ſtanding wood, which was ſo
old that not only the trees had no green leaves upon them but the bark was totally
thrown off, which he was there informed by the old countrymen was the univerſal
manner in which fir-woods terminated, and that in twenty or thirty years the trees
would caſt themſelves up by the roots. About fifteen years after he had occaſion to
travel the ſame way and obſerved that there was not a tree nor the appearance of a
root of any of them; but in their place the whole plain where the wood ſtood was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0811300400:264"/>
covered with a flat green moſs or moraſs, and on aſking the country people what was
become of the wood he was informed that no one had been at the trouble to carry it
away, but that it had all been overturned by the wind, that the trees lay thick over each
other, and that the moſs or bog had overgrown the whole timber, which they added was
occaſioned by the moiſture which came down from the high hills above it and ſtagnated
upon the plain, and that nobody could yet paſs over it, which however his Lordſhip was
ſo incautious as to attempt and ſlipt up to the arm-pits. Before the year 1699 that whole
piece of ground was become a ſolid moſs wherein the peaſants then dug turf or peat,
which however was not yet of the beſt ſort. Philos. Trans. No. 330. Abridg. Vol. V.

through them the moſt ſoluble parts are firſt waſhed away, as the eſſential ſalts, theſe
together with the ſalts from animal recrements are carried down the rivers into the
ſea, where all of them ſeem to decompoſe each other except the marine ſalt. Hence
the aſhes of peat contain little or no vegetable alcali and are not uſed in the countries,
where peat conſtitutes the fuel of the lower people, for the purpoſe of waſhing linen.
The ſecond thing which is always ſeen oozing from moraſſes is iron in ſolution, which
produces chalybeate ſprings, from whence depoſitions of ochre and variety of iron ores.
The third elutriation ſeems to conſiſt of vegetable acid, which by means unknown
appears to be converted into all other acids. 1. Into marine and nitrous acids as
mentioned above. 2. Into vitriolic acid which is found in ſome moraſſes ſo plentifully
as to preſerve the bodies of animals from putrefaction which have been buried in them,
and this acid carried away by rain and dews and meeting with calcareous earth produces
gypſum or alabaſter, with clay it produces alum, and deprived of its vital air produces
ſulphur. 3. Fluor acid which being waſhed away and meeting with calcareous earth
produces fluor or cubic ſpar. 4. The ſiliceous acid which ſeems to have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminated
in great quantity either by ſolution in water or by ſolution in air, and appears
to have produced the ſand in the ſea uniting with calcareous earth previouſly diſſolved
in that element, from which were afterwards formed ſome of the grit-ſtone rocks by
means of a ſiliceous or calcareous cement. By its union with the calcareous earth of
the moraſs other ſtrata of ſiliceous ſand have been produced; and by the mixture of
this with clay and lime aroſe the beds of marl.</p>
                     <p>In other circumſtances, probably where leſs moiſture has prevailed, moraſſes ſeem to
have undergone a fermentation, as other vegetable matter, new hay for inſtance is liable
to do from the great quantity of ſugar it contains. From the great heat thus produced
in the lower parts of immenſe beds of moraſs the phlogiſtic part, or oil, or aſphaltum,
becomes diſtilled, and riſing into higher ſtrata becomes again condenſed forming coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds
of greater or leſs purity according to their greater or leſs quantity of inflammable
matter; at the ſame time the clay beds become purer or leſs ſo, as the phlogiſtic part is
more or leſs completely exhaled from them. Though coal and clay are frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in this manner, yet I have no doubt, but that they are likewiſe often produced by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0811300400:265"/>
elutriation; in ſituations on declivities the clay is waſhed away down into the valleys,
and the phlogiſtic part or coal left behind; this circumſtance is ſeen in many valleys near
the beds of rivers, which are covered recently by a whitiſh impure clay, called water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay.
See note XIX. XX. and XXIII.</p>
                     <p>LORD CROMARTIE has furniſhed another curious obſervation on moraſſes in the
paper above referred to. In a moſs near the town of Eglin in Murray, though there is
no river or water which communicates with the moſs, yet for three or four feet of depth
in the moſs there are little ſhell-fiſh reſembling oyſters with living fiſh in them in great
quantities, though no ſuch fiſh are found in the adjacent rivers, nor even in the water
pits in the moſs, but only in the ſolid ſubſtance of the moſs. This curious fact not
only accounts for the ſhells ſometimes found on the ſurface of coals, and in the clay
above them; but alſo for a thin ſtratum of ſhells which ſometimes exiſts over iron-ore.</p>

                     <p>AS iron is formed near the ſurface of the earth, it becomes expoſed to ſtreams of
water and of air more than moſt other metallic bodies, and thence becomes combined
with oxygene, or vital air, and appears very frequently in its calciform ſtate, as in variety
of ochres. Manganeſe, and zinc, and ſometimes lead, are alſo found near the ſurface of
the earth, and on that account become combined with vital air and are exhibited in their
calciform ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The avidity with which iron unites with oxygene, or vital air, in which proceſs
much heat is given out from the combining materials, is ſhewn by a curious experiment
of M. Ingenhouz. A fine iron wire twiſted ſpirally is fixed to a cork, on the point of the
ſpire is fixed a match made of agaric dipped in ſolution of nitre; the match is then
ignited, and the wire with the cork put immediately into a bottle full of vital air, the
match firſt burns vividly, and the iron ſoon takes fire and conſumes with brilliant ſparks
till it is reduced to ſmall brittle globules, gaining an addition of about one third of its
weight by its union with vital air. Annales de Chymic. Traité de Chimie, per

                        <head>STEEL.</head>
                        <p>It is probably owing to a total deprivation of vital air which it holds with ſo great
avidity, that iron on being kept many hours or days in ignited charcoal becomes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into ſteel, and thence acquires the faculty of being welded when red hot long
before it melts, and alſo the power of becoming hard when immerſed in cold water;
both which I ſuppoſe depend on the ſame cauſe, that is, on its being a worſe conductor
of heat than other metals; and hence the ſurface both acquires heat much ſooner, and
loſes it much ſooner, than the internal parts of it, in this-circumſtance reſembling glaſs.</p>
                        <p>When ſteel is made very hot, and ſuddenly immerged in very cold water, and moved
about in it, the ſurface of the ſteel becomes cooled firſt, and thus producing a kind of
caſe or arch over the internal part, prevents that internal part from contracting quite ſo
much as it otherwiſe would do, whence it becomes brittler and harder, like the glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drops
called Prince Rupert's drops, which are made by dropping melted glaſs into cold
water. This idea is countenanced by the circumſtance that hardened ſteel is ſpecifically
lighter than ſteel which is more gradually cooled. (Nicholſon's Chemiſtry, p. 313.)
Why the brittleneſs and hardneſs of ſteel or glaſs ſhould keep pace or be companions to
each other may be difficult to conceive.</p>
                        <p>When a ſteel ſpring is forcibly bent till it break, it requires leſs power to bend it
through the firſt inch than the ſecond, and leſs through the ſecond than the third; the
ſame I ſuppoſe to happen if a wire be diſtended till it break by hanging weights to it;
this ſhews that the particles may be forced from each other to a ſmall diſtance by leſs
power, than is neceſſary to make them recede to a greater diſtance; in this circumſtance
perhaps the attraction of coheſion differs from that of gravitation, which exerts its power
inverſely as the ſquares of the diſtance. Hence it appears that is the innermoſt particles
of a ſteel bar, by cooling the external ſurface firſt, are kept from approaching each other
ſo nearly as they otherwiſe would do, that they become in the ſituation of the particles
on the convex ſide of a bent ſpring, and can not be forced further from each other except
by a greater power than would have been neceſſary to have made them recede thus far.
And ſecondly, that if they be forced a little further from each other they ſeparate; this
may be exemplified by laying two magnetic needles parallel to each other, the contrary
poles together, then drawing them longitudinally from each other, they will ſlide with
ſmall force till they begin to ſeparate, and will then require a ſtronger force to really
ſeparate them. Hence it appears, that hardneſs and brittleneſs depend on the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
that the particles are removed to a greater diſtance from each other and thus
reſiſt any power more forcibly which is applied to diſplace them further, this conſtitutes
hardneſs. And ſecondly, if they are diſplaced by ſuch applied force they immediately
ſeparate, and this conſtitutes brittleneſs.</p>
                        <p>Steel may be thus rendered too brittle for many purpoſes, on which account artiſts
have means of ſoftening it again, by expoſing it to certain degrees of heat, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of different kinds of tools, which is called tempering it. Some artiſts plunge
large tools in very cold water as ſoon as they are compleatly ignited, and moving it about,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0811300400:267"/>
take it out as ſoon as it ceaſes to be luminous beneath the water; it is then rubbed
quickly with a file or on ſand to clean the ſurface, the heat which the metal ſtill retains
ſoon begins to produce a ſucceſſion of colours; if a hard temper be required, the piece
is dipped again and ſtirred about in cold water as ſoon as the yellow tinge appears, if
it be cooled when the purple tinge appears it becomes fit for gravers' tools uſed in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon metals; if cooled while blue it is proper for ſprings. Nicholſon's Chemiſtry,

                        <head>MODERN PRODUCTION OF IRON.</head>
                        <p>The recent production of iron is evinced from the chalybeate waters which flow
from moraſſes which lie upon gravel-beds, and which muſt therefore have produced
iron after thoſe gravel-beds were raiſed out of the ſea. On the ſouth ſide of the road
between Cheadle and Okeymoor in Staffordſhire, yellow ſtains of iron are ſeen to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
the gravel from a thin moraſs on its ſurface. There is a fiſſure eight or ten feet
wide, in a gravel-bed on the eaſtern ſide of the hollow road aſcending the hill about a
mile from Trentham in Staffordſhire, leading toward Drayton in Shropſhire, which
fiſſure is filled up with nodules of iron-ore. A bank of ſods is now raiſed againſt this
fiſſure to prevent the looſe iron nodules from falling into the turnpike road, and thus
this natural curioſity is at preſent concealed from travellers. A ſimilar fiſſure in a bed
of marl, and filled up with iron nodules and with ſome large pieces of flint, is ſeen on
the eaſtern ſide of the hollow road aſcending the hill from the turnpike houſe about a
mile from Derby in the road towards Burton. And another ſuch fiſſure filled with iron
nodes, appears about half a mile from Newton-Solney in Derbyſhire, in the road to
Burton, near the ſummit of the hill. Theſe collections of iron and of flint muſt have
been produced poſterior to the elevation of all thoſe hills, and were thence evidently of
vegetable or animal origin. To which ſhould be added, that iron is found in general in
beds either near the ſurface of the earth, or ſtratified with clay coals or argillaceous grit,
which are themſelves productions of the modern world, that is, from the recrements of
vegetables and air-breathing animals.</p>
                        <p>Not only iron but mangancſe, calamy, and even copper and lead appear in ſome
inſtances to have been of recent production. Iron and manganeſe are detected in all
vegetable productions, and it is probable other metallic bodies might be found to exiſt
in vegetable or animal matters, if we had teſts to detect them in very minute quantities.
Manganeſe and calamy are found in beds like iron near the ſurface of the earth, and in
a calciform ſtate, which countenances their modern production. The recent production
of calamy, one of the ores of zinc, appears from its frequently incruſting calcareous ſpar
in its deſcent from the ſurface of the earth into the uppermoſt fiſſures of the limeſtone
mountains of Derbyſhire. That the calamy has been carried by its ſolution or diffuſion
in water into theſe cavities, and not by its aſcent from below in form of ſteam, is evinced
from its not only forming a cruſt over the dogtooth ſpar, but by its afterwards diſſolving
or deſtroying the ſparry cryſtal. I have ſpecimens of calamy in the form of dogtooth
ſpar, two inches high, which are hollow, and ſtand half an inch above the diminiſhed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0811300400:268"/>
ſparry cryſtal on which they were formed, like a ſheath a great deal too big for it; this
ſeems to ſhew, that this proceſs was carried on in water, otherwiſe after the calamy had
incruſted its ſpar, and diſſolved its ſurface, ſo as to form a hollow cavern over it, it could
not act further upon it except by the interpoſition of ſome medium. As theſe ſpars and
calamy are formed in the fiſſures of mountains they muſt both have been formed after
the elevation of thoſe mountains.</p>
                        <p>In reſpect to the recent production of copper, it was before obſerved in note on
Canto II. l. 394, that the ſummit of the grit-ſtone mountain at Hawkſtone in Shropſhire,
is tinged with copper, which from the appearance of the blue ſtains ſeems to have
deſcended to the parts of the rock beneath. I have a calciform ore of copper conſiſting
of the hollow cruſts of cubic cells, which has evidently been formed on cryſtals of fluor,
which it has eroded in the ſame manner as the calamy erodes the calcareous cryſtals,
from whence may be deduced in the ſame manner, the aqueous ſolution or diffuſion, as
well as the recent production of this calciform ore of copper.</p>
                        <p>Lead in ſmall quantities is ſometimes found in the fiſſures of coal-beds, which fis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
are previouſly covered with ſpar; and ſometimes in nodules of iron-ore. Of the
former I have a ſpecimen from near Caulk in Derbyſhire, and of the latter from Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook
Dale in Shropſhire. Though all theſe facts ſhew that ſome metallic bodies are
formed from vegetable or animal recrements, as iron, and perhaps manganeſe and
calamy, all which are found near the ſurface of the earth; yet as the other metals are
found only in fiſſures of rocks, which penetrate to unknown depths, they may be wholly
or in part produced by aſcending ſteams from ſubterraneous fires, as mentioned in note
on Canto II. l. 394.</p>

                        <head>SEPTARIA OF IRON-STONE.</head>
                        <p>Over ſome lime works at Walſall in Staffordſhire, I obſerved ſome years ago a ſtratum
of iron earth about ſix inches thick, full of very large cavities; theſe cavities were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
produced when the material paſſed from a ſemifluid ſtate into a ſolid one; as the
frit of the potters, or a mixture of clay and water is liable to crack in drying; which is
owing to the further contraction of the internal part, after the cruſt is become hard.
Theſe hollows are liable to receive extraneous matter, as I believe gypſum, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſpar, and even lead; a curious ſpecimen of the laſt was preſented to me by Mr.
Darby of Colebrook Dale, which contains in its cavity ſome ounces of lead-ore. But
there are other ſeptaria of iron-ſtone which ſeem to have had a very different origin, their
cavities having been formed in cooling or congealing from an ignited ſtate, as is inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly
deduced by Dr. Hutton from their internal ſtruture. Edinb. Tranſact. Vol. I.
p. 246. The volcanic origin of theſe curious ſeptaria appears to me to be further evinced
from their form and the places where they are found. They conſiſt of oblate ſpheroids
and are found in many parts of the earth totally detached from the beds in which they
lie, as at Eaſt Lothian in Scotland. Two of theſe, which now lie before me, were found
with many others immerſed in argillaceous ſhale or ſhiver, ſurrounded by broken lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
mountains at Bradbourn near Aſhbourn in Derbyſhire, and were preſented to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0811300400:269"/>
me by Mr. Buxton, a gentleman of that town. One of theſe is about fifteen inches in
its equatorial diameter, and about ſix inches in its polar one, and contains beautiful ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ſeptaria incruſted and in part filled with calcareous ſpar. The other is about eight
inches in its equatorial diameter, and about four inches in its polar diameter, and is quite
ſolid, but ſhews on its internal ſurface marks of different colours, as if a beginning ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
had taken place. Now as theſe ſeptaria contain fifty per cent, of iron, according
to Dr. Hutton, they would ſoften or melt into a ſemifluid globule by ſubterraneous fire
by leſs heat than the limeſtone in their vicinity; and if they were ejected through a hole
or fiſſure would gain a circular motion along with their progreſſive one by their greater
friction or adheſion to one ſide of the hole. This whirling motion would produce the
oblate ſpheroidical form which they poſſeſs, and which as far as I know can not in any
other way be accounted for. They would then harden in the air as they roſe into the
colder parts of the atmoſphere; and as they deſcended into ſo ſoft a material as ſhale or
ſhiver, their forms would not be injured in their fall; and their preſence in materials ſo
different from themſelves becomes accounted for.</p>
                        <p>About the tropics of the large ſeptarium above mentioned, are circular eminent lines,
ſuch as might have been left is it had been coarſely turned in a lathe. Theſe lines ſeem
to conſiſt of a fluid matter, which ſeems to have exſuded in circular zones, as their edges
appear blunted or retracted; and the ſeptarium ſeems to have ſplit eaſier in ſuch ſections
parallel to its equator. Now as the cruſt would firſt begin to cool and harden after its
ejection in a ſemifluid ſtate, and the equatorial diameter would become gradually enlarged
as it roſe in the air; the internal parts being ſofter would ſlide beneath the polar cruſt,
which might crack and permit part of the ſemifluid to exſude, and it is probable the
adheſion would thus become leſs in ſections parallel to the equator. Which further
confirms this idea of the production of theſe curious ſeptaria. A new-caſt cannon ball
red-hot with its cruſt only ſolid, if it were ſhot into the air would propably burſt in its
paſſage; as it would conſiſt of a more fluid material than theſe ſeptaria; and thus
by diſcharging a ſhower of liquid iron would produce more dreadful combuſtion, if uſed
in war, than could be effected by a ball, which had been cooled and was heated again:
ſince in the latter caſe the ball could not have its internal parts made hotter than the
cruſt of it, without firſt looſing its form.</p>

                        <p>THE great maſſes of ſiliceous ſand which lie in rocks upon the beds of limeſtone, or
which are ſtratified with clay, coal, and iron-ore, are evidently produced in the decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of vegetable or animal matters, as explained in the note on moraſſes. Hence
the impreſſions of vegetable roots and even whole trees are often found in ſand-ſtone, as
well as in coals and iron-ore. In theſe ſand-rocks both the ſiliceous acid and the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous
baſe ſeem to be produced from the materials of the moraſs; for though the
prefence of a ſiliceous acid and of a calcareous baſe have not yet been ſeparately exhibited
from flints, yet from the analogy of flint to fluor, and gypſum, and marble, and from
the converſion of the latter into flint, there can be little doubt of their exiſtence.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſiliceous ſand-rocks are either held together by a ſiliceous cement, or have a
greater or leſs portion of clay in them, which in ſome acts as a cement to the ſiliceous
cryſtals, but in others is in ſuch great abundance that in burning them they become an
imperfect porcelain and are then uſed to repair the roads, as at Cheſterfield in Derbyſhire;
theſe are called argillaceous grit by Mr. Kirwan. In other places a calcareous matter
cements the cryſtals together; and in other places the ſiliceous cryſtals lie in looſe ſtrata
under the marl in the form of white ſand; as at Normington about a mile from Derby.</p>
                        <p>The loweſt beds of ſiliceous ſand-ſtone produced from moraſſes ſeem to obtain their
acid from the moraſs, and their calcareous baſe from the limeſtone on which it reſts.
Theſe beds poſſeſs a ſiliceous cement, and from their greater purity and hardneſs are
uſed for courſe grinding-ſtones and ſcyth ſtones, and are ſituated on the edges of lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
countries, having loſt the other ſtrata of coals, or clay, or iron, which were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
produced above them. Such are the ſand-rocks incumbent on limeſtone near
Matlock in Derbyſhire. As theſe ſiliceous ſand-rocks contain no marine productions
ſcattered amongſt them, they appear to have been elevated, torn to pieces, and many
fragments of them ſcattered over the adjacent country by exploſions, from fires within
the moraſs from which they have been formed; and which diſſipated every thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable
above and beneath them, except ſome ſtains of iron, with which they are in
ſome places ſpotted. If theſe ſand-rocks had been accumulated beneath the ſea, and
elevated along with the beds of limeſtone on which they reſt, ſome veſtiges of marine
ſhells either in their ſiliceous or calcareous ſtate muſt have been diſcerned amongſt
them.</p>

                        <p>In many of theſe ſand-rocks are found the impreſſions of vegetable roots, which ſeem
to have been the moſt unchangeable parts of the plant, as ſhells and ſhark's teeth are
found in chalk-beds from their being the moſt unchangeable parts of the animal. In
other inſtances the wood itſelf is penetrated, and whole trees converted into flint; ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
of which I have by me, from near Covenery, and from a gravel-pit in Shropſhire
near Child's Archal in the road to Drayton. Other poliſhed ſpecimens of vegetable
flints abound in the cabinets of the curious, which evidently ſhew the concentric circles
of woody fibres, and their interſtices filled with whiter ſiliceous matter, with the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off of the knots when cut horizontally, and the parallel lines of wood when cut
longitudinally, with uncommon beauty and variety. Of theſe I poſſeſs ſome beautiful
ſpecimens, which were preſented to me by the Earl of Uxbridge.</p>
                        <p>The colours of theſe ſiliceous vegetables are generally brown, from the iron, I ſuppoſe,
or manganeſe, which induced them to cryſtallize or to fuſe more eaſily. Some of the
cracks of the wood in drying are filled with white flint or calcedony, and others of them
remain hollow, lined with innumerable ſmall cryſtals tinged with iron, which I ſuppoſe
had a ſhare in converting their calcareous matter into ſiliceous cryſtals, becauſe the
cryſtals called Peak-diamonds are always found bedded in an ochreous earth; and thoſe
called Briſtol-ſtones are ſituated on limeſtone coloured with iron. Mr. F. French preſented
me with a congeries of ſiliceous cryſtals, which he gathered on the crater (as he ſuppoſes)
of an extinguiſhed volcano at Cromach Water in Cumberland. The cryſtals are about
an inch high in the ſhape of dogtooth or calcareous ſpar, covered with a dark ferruginous
matter. The bed on which they reſt is about an inch in thickneſs, and is ſtained with
iron on its underſurface. This curious foſſil ſhews the tranſmutation of calcareous earth
into ſiliceous, as much as the ſiliceous ſhells which abound in the cabinets of the curious.
There may ſometime be diſcovered in this age of ſcience, a method of thus impregnating
wood with liquid flint, which would produce pillars for the ſupport, and tiles for the
covering of houſes, which would be uninflammable and endure as long as the earth
beneath them.</p>
                        <p>That ſome ſiliceous productions have been in a fluid ſtate without much heat at the
time of their formation appears from the vegetable flints above deſcribed not having quite
loſt their organized appearance; from ſhells, and coralloids, and entrochi being converted
into flint without looſing their form; from the baſon of calcedony round Gieſar in
Iceland; and from the experiment of Mr. Bergman, who obtained thirteen regular formed
cryſtals by ſuffering the powder of quartz to remain in a veſſel with fluor acid for two
years; theſe cryſtals were about the ſize of ſmall peas, and were not ſo hard as quartz.
Opuſc. de Terrâ Siliceâ, p. 33. Mr. Achard procured both calcareous and ſiliceous
cryſtals, one from calcareous earth, and the other from the earth of alum, both diſſolved
in water impregnated with fixed air; the water filtrating very ſlowly through a porous

                        <head>3. AGATES, ONYXES, SCOTS-PEBBLES.</head>
                        <p>In ſmall cavities of theſe ſand-rocks, I am informed, the beautiful ſiliceous nodules are
found which are called Scot's-pebbles; and which on being cut in different directions
take the names of agates, onyxes, ſardonyxes, &amp;c. according to the colours of the lines
or ſtrata which they exhibit. Some of the nodules are hollow and filled with cryſtals,
others have a nucleus of leſs compact ſiliceous matter which is generally white, ſurrounded
with many concentric ſtrata coloured with iron, and other alternate ſtrata of white agate
or calcedony, ſometimes to the number of thirty.</p>
                        <p>I think theſe nodules bear evident marks of their having been in perfect fuſion by
either heat alone, or by water and heat, under great preſſure, according to the ingenious
theory of Dr. Hutton; but I do not imagine, that they were injected into cavities from
materials from without, but that ſome vegetables or parts of vegetables containing
more iron or manganeſe than others, facilitated the compleat fuſion, thus deſtroying
the veſtiges of vegetable organization, which were conſpicuous in the ſiliceous trees
above mentioned. Some of theſe nodules being hollow and lined with cryſtals, and
others containing a nucleus of white ſiliceous matter of a looſer texture, ſhew they
were compoſed of the materials then exiſting in the cavity; which conſiſting before of
looſe ſand, muſt take up leſs ſpace when fuſed into a ſolid maſs.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſiliceous nodules reſemble the nodules of iron-ſtone mentioned in note on
Canto II. l. 179, in reſpect to their poſſeſſing a great number of concentric ſpheres
coloured generally with iron, but they differ in this circumſtance, that the concentric
ſpheres generally obey the form of the external cruſt, and in their not poſſeſſing a chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beate
nucleus. The ſtalactites formed on the roofs of caverns are often coloured in
concentric ſtrata, by their coats being ſpread over each other at different times; and ſome
of them, as the cupreous ones, poſſeſs great beauty from this formation; but as theſe are
neceſſarily more or leſs of a cylindrical or conic form, the nodules or globular flints
above deſcribed cannot have been conſtructed in this manner. To what law of nature
then is to be referred the production of ſuch numerous concentric ſpheres? I ſuſpect to
the law of congelation.</p>
                        <p>When ſalt and water are expoſed to ſevere froſty air, the ſalt is ſaid to be precipitated
as the water freezes; that is, as the heat, in which it was diſſolved, is withdrawn; where
the experiment is tried in a bowl or baſon, this may be true, as the ſurface freezes firſt,
and the ſalt is found at the bottom. But in a fluid expoſed in a thin phial, I found by
experiment, that the extraneous matter previouſly diſſolved by the heat in the mixture
was not ſimply ſet at liberty to ſubſide, but was detruded or puſhed backward as the ice
was produced. The experiment was this: about two ounces of a ſolution of blue
vitriol were accidentally frozen in a thin phial, the glaſs was cracked and fallen to pieces,
the ice was diſſolved, and I found a pillar of blue vitriol ſtanding erect on the bottom
of the broken bottle. Nor is this power of congelation more extraordinary, than that
by its powerful and ſudden expanſion it ſhould burſt iron ſhells and coehorns, or throw
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0811300400:273"/>
out the plugs with which the water was ſecured in them above one hundred and thirty
yards, according to the experiments at Quebec by Major Williams. Edinb. Tranſact.
Vol. II. p. 23.</p>
                        <p>In ſome ſiliceous nodules which now lie before me, the external cruſt for about the
tenth of an inch conſiſts of white agate, in others it is much thinner, and in ſome much
thicker; correſponding with this cruſt there are from twenty to thirty ſuperincumbent
ſtrata, of alternately darker and lighter colour; whence it appears, that the external cruſt
as it cooled or froze, propelled from it the iron or manganeſe which was diſſolved in it;
this receded till it had formed an arch or vault ſtrong enough to reſiſt its further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion;
then the next inner ſphere or ſtratum as it cooled or froze, propelled forwards
its colouring matter in the ſame manner, till another arch or ſphere produced ſufficient
reſiſtance to this frigorific expulſion. Some of them have detruded their colouring
matter quite to the centre, the rings continuing to become darker as they are nearer it;
in others the chalybeate arch ſeems to have ſtopped half an inch from the centre, and
become thicker by having attracted to itſelf the irony matter from the white nucleus,
owing probably to its cooling leſs precipitately in the central parts than at the ſurface of
the pebble.</p>
                        <p>A ſimilar detruſion of a marly matter in circular arches or vaults obtains in the ſalt
mines in Cheſhire; from whence Dr. Hutton very ingeniouſly concludes, that the ſalt
muſt have been liquified by heat; which would ſeem to be be much confirmed by the
above theory. Edinb. Tranſact. Vol. I. p. 244.</p>
                        <p>I cannot conclude this account of Scots-pebbles without obſerving that ſome of them
on being ſawed longitudinally aſunder, ſeem ſtill to poſſeſs ſome veſtiges of the cylindrical
organization of vegetables; others poſſeſs a nucleus of white agate much reſembling ſome
bulbous roots with their concentric coats, or the knots in elm-roots or crab-trees; ſome
of theſe I ſuppoſe were formed in the manner above explained, during the congelation
of maſſes of melted flint and iron; others may have been formed from a vegetable
nucleus, and retain ſome veſtiges of the organization of the plant.</p>

                        <p>The great abundance of ſiliceous ſand at the bottom of the ocean may in part be
waſhed down from the ſiliceous rocks above deſcribed, but in general I ſuppoſe it derives
its acid only from the vegetable and animal matter of moraſſes, which is carried down by
floods or by the atmoſphere, and becomes united in the ſea with its calcareous baſe from
ſhells and coralloids, and thus aſſumes its cryſtalline form at the bottom of the ocean, and is
there intermixed with gravel or other matters waſhed from the mountains in its vicinity.</p>

                        <p>The rocks of marble are often alternately intermixed with ſtrata of chert, or coarſe
flint, and this in beds from one to three feet thick, as at Ilam and Matlock, or of leſs
than the tenth of an inch in thickneſs, as a mile or two from Bakewell in the road to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0811300400:274"/>
Buxton. It is difficult to conceive in what manner ten or twenty ſtrata of either lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
or flint, of different ſhades of white and black, could be laid quite regularly over
each other from ſediments or precipitations from the ſea; it appears to me much eaſier
to comprehend, by ſuppoſing with Dr. Hutton, that both the ſolid rocks of marble and
the flint had been fuſed by great heat, (or by heat and water,) under immenſe preſſure;
by its cooling or congelating the colouring matter might be detruded, and form parallel
or curvilinean ſtrata, as above explained.</p>
                        <p>The colouring matter both of limeſtone and flint was probably owing to the fleſh of
peculiar animals, as well as the ſiliceous acid, which converted ſome of the limeſtone into
flint; or to ſome ſtrata of ſhell-fiſh having been overwhelmed when alive with new
materials, while others dying in their natural ſituations would loſe their fleſhy parts,
either by its putrid ſolution in the water or by its being eaten by other ſea-inſects. I have
ſome calcareous foſſil ſhells which contain a black coaly matter in them, which was
evidently the body of the animal, and others of the ſame kind filled with ſpar inſtead of
it. The Labradore ſtone has I ſuppoſe its colours from the nacre or mother-pearl ſhells,
from which it was probably produced. And there is a ſtratum of calcareous matter
about ſix or eight inches thick at Wingerworth in Derbyſhire over the iron-beds, which
is replete with ſhells of freſh-water muſcles, and evidently obtains its dark colour from
them, as mentioned in note XVI. Many nodules of flint reſemble in colour as well as
in form the ſhell of the echinus or ſea-urchin; others reſemble ſome coralloids both
in form and colour; and M. Arduini found in the Monte de Pancraſio, red flints
branching like corals, from whence they ſeem to have obtained both their form and
their colour. Ferber's Travels in Italy, p. 42.</p>

                        <head>6. NODULES OF FLINT IN CHALK-BEDS.</head>
                        <p>As the nodules of flint found in chalk-beds poſſeſs no marks of having been rounded
by attrition or ſolution, I conclude that they have gained their form as well as their dark
colour from the fleſh of the ſhell-fiſh from which they had their origin; but which have
been ſo compleatly fuſed by heat, or heat and water, as to obliterate all veſtiges of the
ſhell, in the ſame manner as the nodules of agate and onyx were produced from parts of
vegetables, but which had been ſo completely fuſed as to obliterate all marks of their
organization, or as many iron-nodules have obtained their form and origin from peculiar
vegetables.</p>
                        <p>Some nodules in chalk-beds conſiſt of ſhells of echini filled up with chalk, the animal
having been diſſolved away by putreſcence in water, or eaten by other ſea-inſects; other
ſhells of echini, in which I ſuppoſe the animal's body remained, are converted into flint
but ſtill retain the form of the ſhell. Others, I ſuppoſe as above, being more completely
fuſed, have become flint coloured by the animal fleſh, but without the exact form either
of the fleſh or ſhell of the animal. Many of theſe are hollow within and lined with
cryſtals, like the Scot's-pebbles above deſcribed; but as the colouring matter of animal
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0811300400:275"/>
bodies differs but little from each other compared with thoſe of vegetables, theſe flints
vary leſs in their colours than thoſe above mentioned. At the ſame time as they cooled
in concentric ſpheres like the Scot's-pebbles, they often poſſeſs faint rings of colours, and
always break in concholoid forms like them.</p>
                        <p>This idea of the production of nodules of flint in chalk-beds is countenanced from
the iron which generally appears as theſe flints become decompoſed by the air; which
by uniting with the iron in their compoſition reduces it from a vitreſcent ſtate to that of
calx, and thus renders it viſible. And ſecondly, by there being no appearance in chalk-beds
of a ſtring or pipe of ſiliceous matter connecting one nodule with another, which
muſt have happened if the ſiliceous matter, or its acid, had been injected from without
according to the idea of Dr. Hutton. And thirdly, becauſe many of them have very
large cavities at their centres, which ſhould not have happened had they been formed by
the injection of a material from without.</p>
                        <p>When ſhells or chalk are thus converted from calcareous to ſiliceous matter by the
fleſh of the animal, the new flint being heavier than the ſhell or chalk occupies leſs ſpace
than the materials it was produced from; this is the cauſe of frequent cavities within
them, where the whole maſs has not been completely fuſed and preſſed together. In
Derbyſhire there are maſſes of coralloid and other ſhells which have become ſiliceous,
and are thus left with large vacuities ſometimes within and ſometimes on the outſide of
the remaining form of the ſhell, like the French millſtones, and I ſuppoſe might ſerve
the ſame purpoſe; the gravel of the Derwent is full of ſpecimens of this kind.</p>
                        <p>Since writing the above I have received a very ingenious account of chalk-beds from
Dr. MENISH of Chelmſford. He diſtinguiſhes chalk-beds into three kinds; ſuch as have
been raiſed from the ſea with little diſturbance of their ſtrata, as the cliffs of Dover and
Margate, which he terms <hi>intire</hi> chalk. Another ſtate of chalk is where it has ſuffered
much derangement, as the banks of the Thames at Graveſend and Dartford. And a
third ſtate where fragments of chalk have been rounded by water, which he terms
<hi>alluvial</hi> chalk. In the firſt of theſe ſituations of chalk he obſerves, that the flint lies in
ſtrata horizontally, generally in diſtinct nodules, but that he has obſerved two inſtances
of ſolid plates or ſtrata of flint, from an inch to two inches in thickneſs, interpoſed
between the chalk-beds; one of theſe is in a chalk-bank by the road ſide at Berkhamſtead,
the other in a bank on the road from Chatham leading to Canterbury. Dr. Meniſh has
further obſerved, that many of the echini are cruſhed in their form, and yet filled with
flint, which has taken the form of the cruſhed ſhell, and that though many flint nodules
are hollow, yet that in ſome echini the ſiliceum ſeems to have enlarged, as it paſſed from
a fluid to a ſolid ſtate, as it ſwells out in a protuberance at the mouth and anus of the
ſhell, and that though theſe ſhells are ſo filled with flint yet that in many places the ſhell
itſelf remains calcareous. Theſe ſtrata of nodules and plates of flint ſeem to countenance
their origin from the fleſh of a ſtratum of animals which periſhed by ſome natural
violence, and were buried in their ſhells.</p>

                        <head>7. ANGLES OF SILICEOUS SAND.</head>
                        <p>In many rocks of ſiliceous ſand the particles retain their angular form, and in ſome
beds of looſe ſand, of which there is one of conſiderable purity a few yards beneath the
marl at Normington about a mile ſouth of Derby. Other ſiliceous ſands have had their
angles rounded off, like the pebbles in gravel-beds. Theſe ſeem to owe their globular
form to two cauſes; one to their attrition againſt each other, when they may for centuries
have lain at the bottom of the ſea, or of rivers; where they may have been progreſſively
accumulated, and thus progreſſively at the ſame time rubbed upon each other by the
daſhing of the water, and where they would be more eaſily rolled over each other by the
their gravity being ſo much leſs than in air. This is evidently now going on in the river
Derwent, for though there are no limeſtone rocks for ten or fifteen miles above Derby,
yet a great part of the river-gravel at Derby conſiſts of limeſtone nodules, whoſe angles
are quite worn off in their deſcent down the ſtream.</p>
                        <p>There is however another cauſe which muſt have contributed to round the angles
both of calcareous and ſiliceous fragments; and that is, their ſolubility in water; calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
earth is perpetually found ſuſpended in the waters which paſs over it; and the
earth of flints was obſerved by Bergman to be contained in water in the proportion of
one grain to a gallon. Kirwan's Mineralogy, p. 107. In boiling water, however, it is
ſoluble in much greater proportion, as appears from the ſiliceous earth ſublimed in the
diſtillation of fluor acid in glaſs veſſels; and from the baſons of calcedony which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
the jets of hot water near mount Heccla in Iceland. Troil on Iceland. It is
probable moſt ſiliceous ſands or pebbles have at ſome ages of the world been long expoſed
to aqueous ſteams raiſed by ſubterranean fires. And if fragments of ſtone were long
immerſed in a fluid menſtrum, their angular parts would be firſt diſſolved, on account of
their greater ſurface.</p>
                        <p>Many beds of ſiliceous gravel are cemented together by a ſiliceous cement, and are
called breccia; as the plumb-pudding ſtones of Hartfordſhire, and the walls of a ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
temple excavated by Mr. Curzon, at Hagley near Rugely in Staffordſhire; theſe
may have been expoſed to great heat as they were immerſed in water; which water under
great preſſure of ſuperincumbent materials may have been rendered red-hot, as in Papin's
digeſter; and have thus poſſeſſed powers of ſolution with which we are unacquainted.</p>

                        <p>Another ſourſe of ſiliceous ſtones is from the granite, or baſaltes, or porphyries, which
are of different hardneſſes according to the materials of their compoſition, or to the fire
they have undergone; ſuch are the ſtones of Arthur's-hill near Edinburgh, of the Giant's
Cauſway in Ireland, and of Charnwood Foreſt in Leiceſterſhire; the uppermoſt ſtratum
of which laſt ſeems to have been cracked either by its elevation, or by its haſtily cooling
after ignition by the contact of dews or ſnows, and thus breaks into angular fragments,
ſuch as the ſtreets of London are paved with; or have had their angles rounded by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0811300400:277"/>
attrition or by partial ſolution; and have thus formed the common paving ſtones or
bowlers; as well as the gravel, which is often rolled into ſtrata amid the ſiliceous ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds,
which are either formed or collected in the ſea.</p>
                        <p>In what manner ſuch a maſs of cryſtallized matter as the Giant's Cauſway and ſimilar
columns of baſaltes, could have been raiſed without other volcanic appearances, may be a
matter not eaſy to comprehend; but there is another power in nature beſides that of
expanſile vapour which may have raiſed ſome materials which have previouſly been in
igneous or aqueous ſolution; and that is the act of congelation. When the water in
the experiments above related of Major Williams had by congelation thrown out the
plugs from the bomb-ſhells, a column of ice roſe from the hole of the bomb ſix or eight
inches high. Other bodies I ſuſpect increaſe in bulk which cryſtallize in cooling, as iron
and type-metal. I remember pouring eight or ten pounds of melted brimſtone into
a pot to cool and was ſurprized to ſee after a little time a part of the fluid beneath
break a hole in the congealed cruſt above it, and gradually riſe into a promontory ſeveral
inches high; the baſaltes has many marks of fuſion and of cryſtallization and may
thence, as well as many other kinds of rocks, as of ſpar, marble, petroſilex, jaſper, &amp;c.
have been raiſed by the power of congelation, a power whoſe quantity has not yet
been aſcertained, and perhaps greater and more univerſal than that of vapours expanded
by heat. Theſe baſaltic columns riſe ſometimes out of mountains of granite itſelf, as
mentioned by Dr. Beddoes, (Phil. Tranſact. Vol. LXXX.) and as they ſeem to conſiſt
of ſimilar materials more completely fuſed, there is ſtill greater reaſon to believe them
to have been elevated in the cooling or cryſtallization of the maſs. See note XXIV.</p>

                     <p>THE philoſophers, who have attended to the formation of the earth, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
two great agents in producing the various changes which the terraqueous
globe has undergone, and theſe are water and fire. Some of them have perhaps aſcribed
too much to one of theſe great agents of nature, and ſome to the other. They have
generally agreed that the ſtratification of materials could only be produced from ſediments
or precipitations, which were previouſly mixed or diſſolved in the ſea; and that whatever
effects were produced by fire were performed afterwards.</p>
                     <p>There is however great difficulty in accounting for the univerſal ſtratification of the
ſolid globe of the earth in this manner, ſince many of the materials, which appear in
ſtrata, could not have been ſuſpended in water; as the nodules of flint in chalk-beds,
the extenſive beds of ſhells, and laſtly the ſtrata of coal, clay, ſand, and iron-ore,
which in moſt coal-countries lie from five to ſeven times alternately ſtratified over each
other, and none of them are ſoluble in water. Add to this if a ſolution of them or a
mixture of them in water could be ſuppoſed, the cauſe of that ſolution muſt ceaſe before
a precipitation could commence.</p>
                     <p>1. The great maſſes of lava, under the various names of granite, porphyry, toadſtone,
moor-ſtone, rag, and ſlate, which conſtitute the old word, may have acquired the ſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which ſome of them appear to poſſeſs, by their having been formed by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
eruptions of a fluid maſs, which at different periods of antient time aroſe from
volcanic ſhafts and covered each other, the ſurface of the interior maſs of lava would
cool and become ſolid before the ſuperincumbent ſtratum was poured over it; to the
ſame cauſe may be aſcribed their different compoſitions and textures, which are ſcarcely
the ſame in any two parts of the world.</p>
                     <p>2. The ſtratifications of the great maſſes of limeſtone, which were produced from
ſea-ſhells, ſeem to have been formed by the different times at which the innumerable
ſhells were produced and depoſited. A colony of echini, or madrepores, or cornua
ammonis, lived and periſhed in one period of time; in another a new colony of either
ſimilar or different ſhells lived and died over the former ones, producing a ſtratum of
more recent ſhell over a ſtratum of others which had began to petrify or to become
marble; and thus from unknown depths to what are now the ſummits of mountains
the limeſtone is diſpoſed in ſtrata of varying ſolidity and colour. Theſe have afterwards
undergone variety of changes by their ſolution and depoſition from the water in which
they were immerſed, or from having been expoſed to great heat under great preſſure,
according to the ingenious theory of Dr. Hutton, Edinb. Tranſact. Vol. I. Sec
Note XVI.</p>

3. In moſt of the coal-countries of this iſland there are from five to ſeven beds of
coal ſtratified with an equal number of beds, though of much greater thickneſs, of clay
and ſandſtone, and occaſionally of iron-ores. In what manner to account for the
ſtratification of theſe materials ſeems to be a problem of greater difficulty. Philoſophers
have generally ſuppoſed that they have been arranged by the currents of the ſea;
but conſidering their inſolubility in water, and their almoſt ſimilar ſpecific gravity, an
accumulation of them in ſuch diſtinct beds from this cauſe is altogether inconceiveable,
though ſome coal-countries bear marks of having been at ſome time immerſed beneath
the waves and raiſed again by ſubterranean fires.</p>
                     <p>The higher and lower parts of moraſſes were neceſſarily produced at different periods
of time, ſee Note XVII. and would thus originally be formed in ſtrata of different
ages. For when an old wood periſhed, and produced a moraſs, many centuries would
elapſe before another wood could grow and periſh, again upon the ſame ground, which
would thus produce a new ſtratum of moraſs over the other, differing indeed principally
in its age, and perhaps, as the timber might be different, in the proportions of its
component parts.</p>
                     <p>Now if we ſuppoſe the lowermoſt ſtratum of a moraſs become ignited, like fermenting
hay, (after whatever could be carried away by ſolution in water was gone,) what would
happen? Certainly the inflammable part, the oil, ſulphur, or bitumen, would burn
away, and be evaporated in air; and the fixed parts would be left, as clay, lime, and
iron; while ſome of the calcareous earth would join with the ſiliceous acid, and produce
ſand, or with the argillaceous earth, and produce marl. Thence after many centuries
another bed would take fire, but with leſs degree of ignition, and with a greater body of
moraſs over it, what then would happen? The bitumen and ſulphur would riſe and
might become condenſed under an impervious ſtratum, which might not be ignited, and
there form coal of different purities according to its degree of fluidity, which would
permit ſome of the clay to ſubſide through it into the place from which it was
ſublimed.</p>
                     <p>Some centuries afterwards another ſimilar proceſs might take place, and either thicken
the coal-bed, or produce a new clay-bed, or marl, or ſand, or depoſit iron upon it,
according to the concomitant circumſtances above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean to contend that a few maſſes of ſome materials may not have been
rolled together by currents, when the mountains were much more elevated than at
preſent, and in conſequence the rivers broader and more rapid, and the ſtorms of rain
and wind greater both in quantity and force. Some gravel-beds may have been thus
waſhed from the mountains; and ſome white clay waſhed from moraſſes into valleys
beneath them; and ſome ochres of iron diſſolved and again depoſited by water; and
ſome calcareous depoſitions from water, (as the bank for inſtance on which ſtand the
houſes at Matlock-bath;) but theſe are of ſmall extent or conſequence compared to
the primitive rocks of granite or porpyhry which form the nucleus of the earth, or to
the immenſe ſtrata of limeſtone which cruſt over the greateſt part of this granite or
porphyry; or laſtly to the very extenſive beds of clay, marl, ſandſtone, coal, and iron,

which were probably for many millions of years the only parts of our continents and
iſlands, which were then elevated above the level of the ſea, and which on that account
became covered with vegetation, and thence acquired their later or ſuperincumbent
ſtrata, which conſtitute, what ſome have termed, the new world.</p>
                     <p>There is another ſource of clay, and that of the fineſt kind, from decompoſed
granite, this is of a ſnowy white and mixed with ſhining particles of mica, of this kind
is an earth from the country of Cherokees. Other kinds are from leſs pure lavas;
Mr. Ferber aſſerts that the ſulphurous ſteams from Mount Veſuvius convert the lava
into clay.</p>

                        <q>The lavas of the antient Solfatara volcano have been undoubtedly of a vitreous
nature, and theſe appear at preſent argillaceous. Some fragments of this lava are but
half or at one ſide changed into clay, which either is viſcid or ductile, or hard and
ſtoney. Clays by fire are deprived of their coherent quality, which cannot be reſtored
to them by pulverization, nor by humectation. But the ſulphureous Solfatara ſteams
reſtore it, as may be eaſily obſerved on the broken pots wherein they gather the ſal
ammoniac; though very well baked and burnt at Naples they are mollified again by the
acid ſteams into a viſcid clay which keeps the ſormer fire-burnt colour. <bibl>Travels in

                     <p>THE fine bright purples or roſe colours which we ſee on china cups are not
producible with any other material except gold, manganeſe indeed gives a purple but of
a very different kind.</p>
                     <p>In Europe the application of gold to theſe purpoſes appears to be of modern invention.
Caſſius's diſcovery of the precipitate of gold by tin, and the uſe of that precipitate for
colouring glaſs and enamels, are now generally known, but though the precipitate with
tin be more ſucceſſful in producing the ruby glaſs, or the colourleſs glaſs which
becomes red by ſubſequent ignition, the tin probably contributing to prevent the gold
from ſeparating, (which it is very liable to do during the fuſion; yet, for enamels, the
precipitates made by alcaline ſalts anſwer equally well, and give a finer red, the colour
produced by the tin precipitate being a bluiſh purple, but with the others a roſe red.
I am informed that ſome of our beſt artiſts prefer aurum fulminans, mixing it, before
it has become dry, with the white compoſition or enamel flux; when once it is divided
by the other matter, it is ground with great ſafety, and without the leaſt danger of
exploſion, whether moiſt or dry. The colour is remarkably improved and brought forth
by long grinding, which accordingly makes an eſſential circumſtance in the proceſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0811300400:281"/>
The precipitates of gold, and the colcothar or other red preparations of iron, are
called <hi>tender</hi> colours. The heat muſt be no greater than is juſt ſufficient to make the
enamel run upon the piece, for if greater, the colours will be deſtroyed or changed to a
different kind. When the vitreous matter has juſt become fluid it ſeems as if the
coloured metallic calx remained barely <hi>intermixed</hi> with it, like a coloured powder of
exquiſite tenuity ſuſpended in water: but by ſtronger fire the calx is <hi>diſſolved,</hi> and
metallic colours are altered by <hi>ſolution</hi> in glaſs as well as in acids or alcalies.</p>
                     <p>The Saxon mines have till very lately almoſt excluſively ſupplied the reſt of Europe
with cobalt, or rather with its preparations, zaffre and ſmalt, for the exportation of the
ore itſelf is there a capital crime. Hungary, Spain, Sweden, and ſome other parts of the
continent, are now ſaid to afford cobalts equal to the Saxon, and ſpecimens have been
diſcovered in our own iſland, both in Cornwall and in Scotland; but hitherto in no
great quantity.</p>
                     <p>Calces of cobalt and of copper differ very materially from thoſe above mentioned in
their application for colouring enamels. In thoſe the calx has previouſly acquired the
intended colour, a colour which bears a red heat without injury, and all that remains is
to fix it on the piece by a vitreous flux. But the blue colour of cobalt, and the green
or bluiſh green of copper, are <hi>produced</hi> by vitrification, that is, by <hi>ſolution</hi> in the glaſs, and
a ſtrong fire is neceſſary for their perfection. Theſe calces therefore, when mixed with
the enamel flux, are melted in crucibles, once or oftener, and the deep coloured opake
glaſs, thence reſulting, is ground into unpalpable powder, and uſed for enamel. One
part of either of theſe calces is put to ten, ſixteen, or twenty parts of the flux, according
to the depth of colour required. The heat of the enamel kiln is only a full red, ſuch as
is marked on Mr. Wedgwood's thermometer 6 degrees. It is therefore neceſſary that
the flux be ſo adjuſted as to melt in that low heat. The uſual materials are flint, or
flint-glaſs, with a due proportion of red-led, or borax, or both, and ſometimes a little tin
calx to give opacity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ka-o-lin</hi> is the name given by the Chineſe to their porcelain clay, and <hi>pe-tun-tſe</hi> to the
other ingredient in their China ware. Specimens of both theſe have been brought into
England, and found to agree in quality with ſome of our own materials. Kaolin is the
very ſame with the clay called in Cornwall and the petuntſe is a granite ſimilar
to the Corniſh moorſtone. There are differences, both in the Chineſe petuntſes, and
the Engliſh moorſtones; all of them contain micaceous and quartzy particles, in greater
or leſs quantity, along with feltſpat, which laſt is the eſſential ingredient for the
porcelain manufactory. The only injurious material commonly found in them is iron,
which diſcolours the ware in proportion to its quantity, and which our moorſtones are
perhaps more frequently tainted with than the Chineſe. Very fine porcelain has been
made from Engliſh materials but the nature of the manufacture renders the proceſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
and the profit hazardous; for the ſemivitrification, which conſtitutes porcelain,
is neceſſarily accompanied with a degree of ſoftneſs, or ſemifuſion, ſo that the veſſels are
liable to have their forms altered in the kiln, or to run together with any accidental
augmentations of the fire.

                     <p>THE celebrated funereal vaſe, long in poſſeſſion of the Barberini family, and lately
purchaſed by the Duke of Portland for a thouſand guineas, is about ten inches high and
ſix in diameter in the broadeſt part. The figures are of moſt exquiſite workmanſhip in
bas relief of white opake glaſs, raiſed on a ground of deep blue glaſs, which appears
black except when held againſt the light. Mr. Wedgwood is of opinion from many
circumſtances that the figures have been made by cutting away the external cruſt of
white opake glaſs, in the manner the fineſt cameo's have been produced, and that it
muſt thence have been the labour of a great many years. Some antiquarians have
placed the time of its production many centuries before the chriſtian aera; as ſculpture
was ſaid to have been declining in reſpect to its excellence in the time of Alexander the
Great. See an account of the Barberini or Portland vaſe by M. D'Hancarville, and by
Mr. Wedgwood.</p>
                     <p>Many opinions and conjectures have been publiſhed concerning the figures on this
celebrated vaſe. Having carefully examined one of Mr. Wedgwood's beautiful copies
of this wonderful production of art, I ſhall add one more conjecture to the number.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wedgwood has well obſerved that it does not ſeem probable that the Portland
vaſe was purpoſely made for the aſhes of any particular perſon deceaſed, becauſe many
years muſt have been neceſſary for its production. Hence it may be concluded, that the
ſubject of its embelliſhments is not private hiſtory but of a general nature. This ſubject
appears to me to be well choſen, and the ſtory to be finely told; and that it repreſents
what in antient times engaged the attention of philoſophers, poets, and heroes, I mean a
part of the Eleuſinian myſteries.</p>
                     <p>Theſe myſteries were invented in Aegypt, and afterwards tranſferred to Greece, and
flouriſhed more particularly at Athens, which was at the ſame time the ſeat of the fine
arts. They conſiſted of ſcenical exhibitions repreſenting and inculcating the expectation
of a future life after death, and on this account were encouraged by the government,
inſomuch that the Athenian laws puniſhed a diſcovery of their ſecrets with death.
Dr. Warburton has with great learning and ingenuity ſhewn that the deſcent of Aeneas
into hell, deſcribed in the Sixth Book of Virgil, is a poetical account of the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the future ſtate in the Eleuſinian myſteries. Divine Legation, Vol. I. p, 210.</p>
                     <p>And though ſome writers have differed in opinion from Dr. Warburton on this
ſubject, becauſe Virgil has introduced ſome of his own heroes into the Elyſian fields, as
Deiphobus, Palinurus, and Dido, in the ſame manner as Homer had done before him,
yet it is agreed that the received notions about a future ſtate were exhibited in theſe
myſteries, and as theſe poets deſcribed thoſe received notions, they may be ſaid, as far as
theſe religious doctrines were concerned, to have deſcribed the myſteries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0811300400:284"/>
Now as theſe were emblematic exhibitions they muſt have been as well adapted to
the purpoſes of ſculpture as of poetry, which indeed does not ſeem to have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common,
ſince one compartment of figures in the ſheild of Aeneas repreſented the regions
of Tartarus. Aen. Lib. X. The proceſſion of torches, which according to M. De St.
Croix was exhibited in theſe myſteries, is ſtill to be ſeen in baſſo relievo, diſcovered by
Spon and Wheler. Memoires ſur le Myſteres par De St. Croix. 1784. And it is very
probable that the beautiful gem repreſenting the marriage of Cupid and Pſyche, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by Apulcus, was originally deſcriptive of another part of the exhibitions in theſe
myſteries, though afterwards it became a common ſubject of antient art. See Divine
Legat. Vol. I. p. 323. What ſubject could have been imagined ſo ſublime for the
ornaments of a funereal urn as the mortality of all things and their reſuſcitation? Where
could the deſigner be ſupplied with emblems for this purpoſe, before the Chriſtian aera,
but from the Eleuſinian myſteries?</p>
                     <p>1. The exhibitions of the myſteries were of two kinds, thoſe which the people were
permitted to ſee, and thoſe which were only ſhewn to the initiated. Concerning the
latter, Ariſtides calls them  <q>the moſt ſhocking and moſt raviſhing repreſentations.</q> And
Stoboeus aſſerts that the initiation into the grand myſteries exactly reſembles death.
Divine Legat. Vol. I. p. 280, and p. 272. And Virgil in his entrance to the ſhades
below, amongſt other things of terrible form, mentions death. Aen. VI. This part of
the exhibition ſeems to be repreſented in one of the compartments of the Portland
vaſe.</p>
                     <p>Three figures of exquiſite workmanſhip are placed by the ſide of a ruined column
whoſe capital is fallen off, and lies at their feet with other diſjointed ſtones, they ſit on
looſe piles of ſtone beneath a tree, which has not the leaves of any evergreen of this
climate, but may be ſuppoſed to be an elm, which Virgil places near the entrance of the
infernal regions, and adds, that a dream was believed to dwell under every leaf of it.
Aen. VI. l. 281. In the midſt of this group reclines a female figure in a dying attitude,
in which extreme languor is beautifully repreſented, in her hand is an inverted torch, an
antient emblem of extinguiſhed life, the elbow of the ſame arm reſting on a ſtone ſupports
her as ſhe ſinks, while the other hand is raiſed and thrown over her drooping head, in
ſome meaſure ſuſtaining it and gives with great art the idea of fainting laſſitude. On
the right of her ſits a man, and on the left a woman, both ſupporting themſelves on their
arms, as people are liable to do when they are thinking intenſely. They have their
backs towards the dying figure, yet with their faces turned towards her, as if ſeriouſly
contemplating her ſituation, but without ſtretching out their hands to aſſiſt her.</p>
                     <p>This central figure then appears to me to be an hieroglyphic or Eleuſinian emblem of
MORTAL LIFF, that is, the lethum, or death, mentioned by Virgil amongſt the terrible
things exhibited at the beginning of the myſteries. The inverted torch ſhews the
figure to be emblematic, if it had been deſigned to repreſent a real perſon in the act of
dying there had been no neceſſity for the expiring torch, as the dying figure alone would
have been ſufficiently intelligible;—it would have been as abſurd as to have put an
inverted torch into the hand of a real perſon at the time of his expiring. Beſides if this

figure had repreſented a real dying perſon would not the other figures, or one of them at
leaſt, have ſtretched out a hand to ſupport her, to have eaſed her fall among looſe ſtones,
or to have ſmoothed her pillow? Theſe circumſtances evince that the figure is an
emblem, and therefore could not be a repreſentation of the private hiſtory of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
family or event.</p>
                     <p>The man and woman on each ſide of the dying figure muſt be conſidered as emblems,
both from their ſimilarity of ſituation and dreſs to the middle figure, and their being
grouped along with it. Theſe I think are hieroglyphic or Eleuſinian emblems of
HUMANKIND, with their backs toward the dying figure of MORTAL LIFE, unwilling to
aſſociate with her, yet turning back their ſerious and attentive countenances, curious
indeed to behold, yet ſorry to contemplate their latter end. Theſe figures bring ſtrongly
to one's mind the Adam and Eve of ſacred writ, whom ſome have ſuppoſed to have
been allegorical or hieroglyphic perſons of Aegyptian origin, but of more antient date,
amongſt whom I think is Dr. Warburton. According to this opinion Adam and Eve
were the names of two hieroglyphic figures repreſenting the early ſtate of mankind;
Abel was the name of an hieroglyphic figure repreſenting the age of paſturage, and Cain
the name of another hieroglyphic ſymbol repreſenting the age of agriculture, at which
time the uſes of iron were diſcovered. And as the people who cultivated the earth and
built houſes would increaſe in numbers much faſter by their greater production of food,
they would readily conquer or deſtroy the people who were ſuſtained by paſturage, which
was typified by Cain ſlaying Abel.</p>
                     <p>2. On the other compartment of this celebrated vaſe is exhibited an emblem of
immortality, the repreſentation of which was well known to conſtitute a very principal
part of the ſhews at the Eleuſinian myſteries, as Dr. Warburton has proved by variety
of authority. The habitation of ſpirits or ghoſts after death was ſuppoſed by the
antients to be placed beneath the earth, where Pluto reigned, and diſpenſed rewards or
puniſhments. Hence the firſt figure in this group is of the MANES or GHOST, who
having paſſed through an open portal is deſcending into a duſky region, pointing his
toe with timid and unſteady ſtep, feeling as it were his way in the gloom. This portal
Aeneas enters, which is deſcribed by Virgil,—patet atri janua ditis, Aen. VI. l. 126; as
well as the eaſy deſcent,—facilis deſcenſus Averni. Ib. The darkneſs at the entrance
to the ſhades is humorouſly deſcribed by Lucian. Div. Legat. Vol. I. p. 241. And the
horror of the gates of hell was in the time of Homer become a proverb; Achilles ſays
to Ulyſſes, "I hate a liar worſe than the gates of hell;" the ſame expreſſion is uſed in
Iſaiah, ch. xxxviii. v. 10. The MANES or GHOST appears lingering and fearful, and
wiſhes to drag after him a part of his mortal garment, which however adheres to the
ſide of the portal through which he has paſſed. The beauty of this allegory would have
been expreſſed by Mr. Pope, by "We feel the ruling paſſion ſtrong in death."</p>
                     <p>A little lower down in the group the manes or ghoſt is received by a beautiful female,
a ſymbol of IMMORTAL LIFE. This is evinced by her fondling between her knees a
large and playful ſerpent, which from its annually renewing its external ſkin has from
great antiquity, even as early as the fable of Prometheus, been eſteemed an emblem of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0811300400:288"/>
renovated youth. The ſtory of the ſerpent acquiring immortal life from the aſs of
Prometheus, who carried it on his back, is told in Bacon's Works, Vol. V. p. 462.
Quarto edit. Lond. 1778. For a ſimilar purpoſe a ſerpent was wrapped round the
large hieroglyphic egg in the temple of Dioſcuri, as an emblem of the renewal of life
from a ſtate of death. Bryant's Mythology, Vol II. p. 359. ſec. edit. On this account
alſo the ſerpent was an attendant on Aeſculapius, which ſeems to have been the name of
the hieroglyphic figure of medicine. This ſerpent ſhews this figure to be an emblem,
as the torch ſhewed the central figure of the other compartment to be an emblem, hence
they agreeably correſpond, and explain each other, one repreſenting MORTAL LIFE, and
the other IMMORTAL LIFE.</p>
                     <p>This emblematic figure of immortal life ſits down with her feet towards the figure of
Pluto, but, turning back her face towards the timid ghoſt, ſhe ſtretches forth her hand,
and taking hold of his elbow, ſupports his tottering ſteps, as well as encourages him to
advance, both which circumſtances are thus with wonderful ingenuity brought to the
eye. At the ſame time the ſpirit looſely lays his hand upon her arm, as one walking in
the dark would naturally do for the greater certainty of following his conductreſs, while
the general part of the ſymbol of IMMORTAL LIFE, being turned toward the figure of
Pluto, ſhews that ſhe is leading the phantom to his realms.</p>
                     <p>In the Pamphili gardens at Rome, Perſeus in aſſiſting Andromeda to deſcend from the
rock takes hold of her elbow to ſteady or ſupport her ſtep, and ſhe lays her hand looſely
on his arm as in this figure. Admir. Roman. Antiq.</p>
                     <p>The figure of PLUTO can not be miſtaken, as is agreed by moſt of the writers who
have mentioned this vaſe; his griſley beard, and his having one foot buried in the earth,
denotes the infernal monarch. He is placed at the loweſt part of the group, and reſting
his chin on his hand, and his arm upon his knee, receives the ſtranger-ſpirit with
inquiſitive attention; it was before obſerved that when people think attentively they
naturally reſt their bodies in ſome eaſy attitude, that more animal power may be employed
on the thinking faculty. In this group of figures there is great art ſhewn in giving an
idea of a deſcending plain, viz. from earth to Elyſium, and yet all the figures are in
reality on an horizontal one. This wonderful deception is produced firſt by the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtep of the manes or ghoſt; ſecondly, by the arm of the ſitting figure of immortal life
being raiſed up to receive him as he deſcends; and laſtly, by Pluto having one foot
ſunk into the earth.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another figure which is concerned in conducting the manes or ghoſt to
the realms of Pluto, and this is LOVE. He precedes the deſcending ſpirit on expanded
wings, lights him with his torch, and turning back his beautiful countenance beckons
him to advance. The antient God of love was of much higher dignity than the modern
Cupid. He was the firſt that came out of the great egg of night, (Heſiod. Theog.
V. CXX. Bryant's Mythol. Vol. II. p. 348.) and is ſaid to poſſeſs the keys of the
ſky, ſea, and earth. As he therefore led the way into this life, he ſeems to conſtitute a
proper emblem for leading the way to a ſuture life. See Bacon's works. Vol. I. p. 568.
and Vol. III. p. 582. Quarto edit.</p>

The introduction of love into this part of the myſteries requires a little further expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
The Pſyche of the Aegyptians was one of their moſt favourite emblems, and
repreſented the ſoul, or a future life; it was originally no other than the aurelia, or
butterfly, but in after times was repreſented by a lovely female child with the beautiful
wings of that inſect. The aurelia, after its firſt ſtage as an eruca or caterpillar, lies for
a ſeaſon in a manner dead, and is incloſed in a ſort of coffin, in this ſtate of darkneſs it
remains all the winter, but at the return of ſpring it burſts its bonds and comes out
with new life, and in the moſt beautiful attire. The Aegyptians thought this a very
proper picture of the ſoul of man, and of the immortality to which it aſpired. But as
this was all owing to divine Love, of which EROS was an emblem, we find this perſon
frequently introduced as a concomitant of the ſoul in general or Pſyche. (Bryant's
Mythol. Vol. II. p. 386.) EROS, or divine Love, is for the ſame reaſon a proper attendant
on the manes or ſoul after death, and much contributes to tell the ſtory, that is, to
ſhew that a ſoul or manes is deſigned by the deſcending figure. From this figure of
Love M. D'Hancarville imagines that Orpheus and Eurydice are typified under the
figure of the manes and immortal life as above deſcribed. It may be ſufficient to anſwer,
firſt, that Orpheus is always repreſented with a lyre, of which there are prints of four
different gems in Spence's Polymetis, and Virgil ſo deſcribes him, Aen. VI. cytharâ.
fretus. And ſecondly, that it is abſurd to ſuppoſe that Eurydice was fondling and
playing with a ſerpent that had ſlain her. Add to this that Love ſeems to have been an
inhabitant of the infernal regions, as exhibited in the myſteries, for Claudian, who
treats more openly of the Eleuſinian myſteries, when they were held in leſs veneration,
invokes the deities to diſcloſe to him their ſecrets, and amongſt other things by what
torch Love ſoftens Pluto.</p>

one of them has ſmoother leaves like ſome evergreens, and might thence be ſuppoſed to
have ſome alluſion to immortality, but they may perhaps have been deſigned only as
ornaments, or to relieve the figures, or becauſe it was in groves, where theſe myſteries
were originally celebrated. Thus Homer ſpeaks of the woods of Proſerpine, and
mentions many trees in Tartarus, as preſenting their fruits to Tantalus; Virgil ſpeaks
of the pleaſant groves of Elyſium; and in Spence's Polymetis there are prints of two
antient gems, one of Orpheus charming Cerberus with his lyre, and the other of Hercules
binding him in a cord, each of them ſtanding by a tree. Polymet. p. 284. As however
theſe trees have all different foliage ſo clearly marked by the artiſt, they may have had
ſpecific meanings in the exhibitions of the myſteries, which have not reached poſterity,
of this kind ſeem to have been the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and the tree of
life, in ſacred writ, both which muſt have been emblematic or allegorical. The maſks,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0811300400:290"/>
hanging to the handles of the vaſe, ſeem to indicate that there is a concealed meaning in
the figures beſides their general appearance. And the prieſteſs at the bottom, which I
come now to deſcribe, ſeems to ſhew this concealed meaning to be of the ſacred or
Eleuſinian kind.</p>
                     <p>3. The figure on the bottom of the vaſe is on a larger ſcale than the others, and leſs
finely finiſhed, and leſs elevated, and as this bottom part was afterwards cemented to the
upper part, it might be executed by another artiſt for the ſake of expedition, but there
ſeems no reaſon to ſuppoſe that it was not originally deſigned for the upper part of it as
ſome have conjectured. As the myſteries of Ceres were celebrated by female prieſts, for
Porphyrius ſays the antients called the prieſteſſes of Ceres, Meliſſai, or bees, which were
emblems of chaſtity. Div. Leg. Vol. I. p. 235. And as, in his Satire againſt the ſex,
Juvenal ſays, that few women are worthy to be prieſteſſes of Ceres. Sat. VI. the figure
at the bottom of the vaſe would ſeem to repreſent a PRIESTESS or HIEROPHANT, whoſe
office it was to introduce the initiated, and point out to them, and explain the
exhibitions in the myſteries, and to exclude the uninitiated, calling out to them, " Far,
far retire, ye profane!" and to guard the ſecrets of the temple. Thus the introductory
hymn ſung by the hierophant, according to Euſebius, begins, "I will declare a ſecret to
the initiated, but let the doors be ſhut againſt the profane." Div. Leg. Vol. I. p. 177.
The prieſteſs or hierophant appears in this figure with a cloſe hood, and dreſſed in linen,
which ſits cloſe about her; except a light cloak, which flutters in the wind. Wool,
as taken from ſlaughtered animals, was eſteemed profane by the prieſts of Aegypt, who
were always dreſſed in linen. Apuleus, p. 64. Div. Leg. Vol. I. p. 318. Thus Eli
made for Samuel a linen ephod. Samuel i. 3.</p>
                     <p>Secrecy was the foundation on which all myſteries reſted, when publicly known they
ceaſed to be myſteries; hence a diſcovery of them was not only puniſhed with death by
the Athenian law; but in other countries a diſgrace attended the breach of a ſolemn
oath. The prieſteſs in the figure before us has her finger pointing to her lips as an
emblem of ſilence. There is a figure of Harpocrates, who was of Aegyptian origin, the
ſame as Orus, with the lotus on his head, and with his finger pointing to his lips not
preſſed upon them, in Bryant's Mythol. Vol. II. p. 398, and another female figure
ſtanding on a lotus, as if juſt riſen from the Nile, with her finger in the ſame attitude,
theſe ſeem to have been repreſentations or emblems of male and female prieſts of
the ſecret myſteries. As theſe ſort of emblems were frequently changed by artiſts for
their more elegant exhibition, it is poſſible the foliage over the head of this figure may
bear ſome analogy to the lotus above mentioned.</p>
                     <p>This figure of ſecrecy ſeems to be here placed, with great ingenuity, as a caution to
the initiated, who might underſtand the meaning of the emblems round the vaſe, not
to divulge it. And this circumſtance ſeems to account for there being no written ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
extant, and no tradition concerning theſe beautiful figures handed down to us
along with them.</p>
                     <p>Another explanation of this figure at the bottom of the vaſe would ſeem to confirm
the idea that the baſſo relievos round its ſides are repreſentations of a part of the

myſteries, I mean that it is the head of ATIS. Lucian ſays that Atis was a young man
of Phrygia, of uncommon beauty, that he dedicated a temple in Syria to Rhea, or
Cybele, and firſt taught her myſteries to the Lydians, Phrygians, and Samothracians,
which myſteries he brought from India. He was afterwards made an eunuch by Rhea,
and lived like a woman, and aſſumed a feminine habit, and in that garb went over the
world teaching her ceremonies and myſteries. Dict. par M. Danet, art. Atis. As this
figure is covered with clothes, while thoſe on the ſides of the vaſe are naked, and has a
Phrygian cap on the head, and as the form and features are ſo ſoft, that it is difficult to
ſay whether it be a male or female figure, there is reaſon to conclude, 1. that it has
reference to ſome particular perſon of ſome particular country; 2. that this perſon is
Atis, the firſt great hierophant, or teacher of myſteries, to whom M. De la Chauſſe ſays
the figure itſelf bears a reſemblance. Muſeo. Capitol. Tom. IV. p. 402.</p>
                     <p>In the Muſeum Etruſcum, Vol. I. plate 96, there is the head of Atis with feminine
features, clothed with a Phrygian cap, and riſing from very broad foliage, placed on a
kind of term ſupported by the paw of a lion. Goreus in his explanation of the figure
ſays that it is placed on a lion's foot becauſe that animal was ſacred to Cybele, and that
it riſes from very broad leaves becauſe after he became an eunuch he determined to
dwell in the groves. Thus the foliage, as well as the cap and feminine features, confirm
the idea of this figure at the bottom of the vaſe repreſenting the head of Atis the firſt
great hierophant, and that the figures on the ſides of the vaſe are emblems from the
antient myſteries.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to add that it does not appear to have been uncommon amongſt the
antients to put allegorical figures on funeral vaſes. In the Pamphili palace at Rome
there is an elaborate repreſentation of Life and of Death, on an antient ſarcophagus. In
the firſt Prometheus is repreſented making man, and Minerva is placing a butterfly, or
the foul, upon his head. In the other compartment Love extinguiſhes his torch in the
boſom of the dying figure, and is receiving the butterfly, or Pſyche, from him, with a
great number of complicated emblematic figures grouped in very bad taſte. Admir.

                     <p>TO elucidate the formation of coal-beds I ſhall here deſcribe a fountain of foſſil tar,
or petroleum, diſcovered lately near Colebrook Dale in Shropſhire, the particulars of
which were ſent me by Dr. Robert Darwin of Shrewſbury.</p>
                     <p>About a mile and a half below the celebrated iron-bridge, conſtructed by the late
Mr. DARBY near Colebrook Dale, on the eaſt ſide of the river Severn, as the workmen
in October 1786 were making a ſubterranean canal into the mountain, for the more
eaſy acquiſition and conveyance of the coals which lie under it, they found an oozing of
liquid bitumen, or petroleum; and as they proceeded further cut through ſmall cavities
of different ſizes from which the bitumen iſſued. From ten to fifteen barrels of this
foſſil tar, each barrel containing thirty-two gallons, were at firſt collected in a day,
which has ſince however gradually diminiſhed in quantity, ſo that at preſent the product
is about ſeven barrels in fourteen days.</p>
                     <p>The mountain, into which this canal enters, conſiſts of ſiliceous ſand, in which
however a few marine productions, apparently in their recent ſtate, have been found,
and are now in the poſſeſſion of Mr. WILLIAM REYNOLDS of Ketly Bank. About
three hundred yards from the entrance into the mountain, and about twenty-eight yards
below the ſurface of it, the tar is found oozing from the ſand-rock above into the top
and ſides of the canal.</p>
                     <p>Beneath the level of this canal a ſhaft has been ſunk through a grey argillaceous
ſubſtance, called in this country clunch, which is ſaid to be a pretty certain indication
of coal; beneath this lies a ſtratum of coal, about two or three inches thick, of an
inferior kind, yielding little flame in burning, and leaving much aſhes; below this is a
rock of a harder texture; and beneath this are found coals of an excellent quality; for
the purpoſe of procuring which with greater facility the canal, or horizontal aperture, is
now making into the mountain. July, 1788.</p>
                     <p>Beneath theſe coals in ſome places is found ſalt water, in other parts of the adjacent
country there are beds of iron-ſtone, which alſo contain ſome bitumen in a leſs fluid
ſtate, and which are about on a level with the new canal, into which the foſſil tar oozes,
as above deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>There are many intereſting circumſtances attending the ſituation and accompaniments
of this fountain of foſſil tar, tending to develop the manner of its production. 1. As the
canal paſſing into the mountain runs over the beds of coals, and under the reſervoir
of petroleum, it appears that a <hi>natural diſtillation</hi> of this foſſil in the bowels of the earth
muſt have taken place at ſome early period of the world, ſimilar to the artificial diſtillation
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0811300400:294"/>
of coal, which has many years been carried on in this place on a ſmaller ſcale above
ground. When this reſervoir of petroleum was cut into, the ſlowneſs of its exſudation
into the canal was not only owing to its viſcidity, but to the preſſure of the atmoſphere,
or to the neceſſity there was that air ſhould at the ſame time inſinuate itſelf into the ſmall
cavities from which the petroleum deſcended. The exiſtence of ſuch a diſtillation at
ſome antient time is confirmed by the thin ſtratum of coal beneath the canal, (which
covers the hard rock,) having been deprived of its foſſil oil, ſo as to burn without flame,
and thus to have become a natural coak, or foſſil charcoal, while the petroleum diſtilled
from it is found in the cavities of the rock above it.</p>
                     <p>There are appearances in other places, which favour this idea of the natural diſtillation
of petroleum, thus at Matlock in Derbyſhire a hard bitumen is found adhering to the
ſpar in the clefts of the lime-rocks in the form of round drops about the ſize of peas;
which could perhaps only be depoſited there in that form by ſublimation.</p>
                     <p>2. The ſecond deduction, which offers itſelf, is, that theſe beds of coal have been
<hi>expoſed to a conſiderable degree of heat,</hi> ſince the petroleum above could not be ſeparated,
as far as we know, by any other means, and that the good quality of the coals beneath
the hard rock was owing to the impermeability of this rock to the bituminous vapour,
and to its preſſure being too great to permit its being removed by the elaſticity of that
vapour. Thus from the degree of heat, the degree of preſſure, and the permeability of
the ſuperincumbent ſtrata, many of the phenomena attending coal-beds receive an eaſy
explanation, which much accords with the ingenious theory of the earth by Dr. Hutton.
Trans. of Edinb. Vol. I.</p>
                     <p>In ſome coal works the fuſion of the ſtrata of coal has been ſo ſlight, that there
remains the appearance of ligneus fibres, and the impreſſion of leaves, as at Bovey near
Exeter, and even ſeeds of vegetables, of which I have had ſpecimens from the collieries
near Poleſworth in Warwickſhire. In ſome, where the heat was not very intenſe and
the incumbent ſtratum not permeable to vapour, the foſſil oil has only riſen to the
upper part of the coal-bed, and has rendered that much more inflammable than the
lower parts of it, as in the collieries near Beaudeſert, the ſeat of the EARL OF UXBRIDGE
in Staffordſhire, where the upper ſtratum is a perfect cannel, or candle-coal, and the
lower one of an inferior quality. Over the coal-beds near Sir H. HARPUR's houſe in
Derbyſhire a thin lamina of aſphaltum is found in ſome places near the ſurface of the
earth, which would ſeem to be from a diſtillation of petroleum from the coals below,
the more fluid part of which had in proceſs of time exhaled, or been conſolidated by its
abſorption of air. In other coal-works the upper part of the ſtratum is of a worſe kind
than the lower one, as at Alfreton and Denbigh in Derbyſhire, owing to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
ſtratum having permitted the exhalation of a great part of the petroleum;
whilſt at Widdrington in Northumberland there is firſt a ſeam of coal about ſix inches
thick of no value, which lies under about four fathom of clay, beneath this is a white
freeſtone, then a hard ſtone, which the workmen there call a whin, then two fathoms
of clay, then another white ſtone, and under that a vein of coals three feet nine inches
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0811300400:295"/>
thick, of a ſimilar nature to the Newcaſtle coal. Phil. Trans. Abridg. Vol. VI. plate II.
p. 192. The ſimilitude between the circumſtances of this colliery, and of the coal
beneath the fountain of tar above deſcribed, renders it highly probable that this upper
thin ſeam of coal has ſuffered a ſimilar diſtillation, and that the inflammable part of it
had either been received into the clay above in the form of ſulphur, which when burnt
in the open air would produce alum; or had been diſſipated for want of a receiver,
where it could be condenſed. The former opinion is perhaps in this cafe more probable
as in ſome other coal-beds, of which I have procured accounts, the ſurface of the coal
beneath clunch or clay is of an inferior quality, as at Weſt Hallum in Nottinghamſhire.
The clunch probably from hence acquires its inflammable part, which on calcination
becomes vitriolic acid. I gathered pieces of clunch converted partially into alum at a
colliery near Bilſton, where the ground was ſtill on fire a few years ago.</p>
                     <p>The heat, which has thus pervaded the beds of moraſs, ſeems to have been the
effect of the fermentation of their vegetable materials; as new hay ſometimes takes fire
even in ſuch very ſmall maſſes from the ſugar it contains, and ſeems hence not to have
been attended with any expulſion of lava, like the deeper craters of volcanos ſituated in
beds of granite.</p>
                     <p>3. The marine ſhells found in the looſe ſand-rock above this reſervoir of petroleum,
and the coal-beds beneath it, together with the exiſtence of ſea-ſalt beneath theſe coals,
prove that theſe coal beds have been <hi>at the bottom of the ſea,</hi> during ſome remote period
of time, and were afterwards raiſed into their preſent ſituation by ſubterraneous expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of vapour. This doctrine is further ſupported by the marks of violence, which
ſome coal-beds received at the time they were raiſed out of the ſea, as in the collieries at
Mendip in Somerſetſhire. In theſe there are ſeven ſtrata of coals, equitant upon each
other, with beds of clay and ſtone intervening; amongſt which clay are found ſhells and
fern branches. In one part of this hill the ſtrata are diſjoined, and a quantity of
heterogeneous ſubſtances fill up the chaſm which diſjoins them, on one ſide of this
chaſm the ſeven ſtrata of coal are ſeen correſponding in reſpect to their reciprocal thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and goodneſs with the ſeven ſtrata on the other ſide of the cavity, except that they
have been elevated ſeveral yards higher. Phil. Tranſ. No. 360. abridg. Vol. V. p. 237.</p>
                     <p>The cracks in the coal-bed near Ticknall in Derbyſhire, and in the ſand-ſtone rock
over it, in both of which ſpecimens of lead-ore and ſpar are found, confirm this opinion
of their having been forcibly raiſed up by ſubterraneous fires. Over the colliery at
Brown-hills near Lichfield, there is a ſtratum of gravel on the ſurface of the ground;
which may be adduced as another proof to ſhew that thoſe coals had ſome time been
beneath the ſea, or the bed of a river. Nevertheleſs, theſe arguments only apply to the
collieries above mentioned, which are few compared with thoſe which bear no marks of
having been immerſed in the ſea.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand the production of coals from moraſſes, as deſcribed in note XX.
is evinced from the vegetable matters frequently found in them, and in the ſtrata over
them; as fern-leaves in nodules of iron-ore, and from the bog-ſhells or freſh water
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0811300400:296"/>
muſcles ſometimes found over them, of both which I have what I believe to be ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens;
and is further proved from ſome parts of theſe beds being only in part trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to coal; and the other part ſtill retaining not only the form, but ſome of the
properties of wood; ſpecimens of which are not unfrequent in the cabinets of the curious,
procured from Loch Neigh in Ireland, from Bovey near Exeter, and other places; and
from a famous cavern called the Temple of the Devil, near the town of Altorf in Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia,
at the foot of a mountain covered with pine and ſavine, in which are found large
coals reſembling trees of ebony; which are ſo far mineralized as to be heavy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact;
and ſo to effloreſce with pyrites in ſome parts as to crumble to pieces; yet from
other parts white aſhes are produced on calcination, from which <hi>fixed alcali</hi> is procured;
which evinces their vegetable origin. (Dict. Raiſonné, art. Charbon.) To theſe may
be added another argument from the oil which is diſtilled from coals, and which is
analogous to vegetable oil, and does not exiſt in any bodies truly mineral. Keir's
Chemical Dictionary, art. Bitumen.</p>
                     <p>Whence it would appear, that though moſt collieries with their attendant ſtrata
of clay, ſand-ſtone, and iron, were formed on the places where the vegetables grew,
from which they had their origin; yet that other collections of vegetable matter were
waſhed down from eminences by currents of waters into the beds of rivers, or the
neighbouring ſeas, and were there accumulated at different periods of time, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
a great degree of heat from their fermentation, in the ſame manner as thoſe beds
of moraſs which had continued on the plains where they were produced. And that by
this fermentation many of them had been raiſed from the ocean with ſand and ſea-ſhells
over them; and others from the beds of rivers with accumulations of gravel upon them.</p>

As theſe ſtrata generally lie inclined, I ſuppoſe parallel with the limeſtone on which
they reſt, the upper edges of them all come out to day, which is termed baſſetting;
when the whole maſs was ignited by its fermentation, it is probable that the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
part of ſome ſtrata might thus more eaſily eſcape than of others in the form of
vapour; as dews are known to ſlide between ſuch ſtrata in the production of ſprings;
which accounts for ſome coal-beds being ſo much worſe than others. See note XX.</p>

                     <p>THE loweſt ſtratum of the earth which human labour has arrived to, is granite;
and of this likewiſe conſiſts the higheſt mountains of the world. It is known under
variety of names according to ſome difference in its appearance or compoſition, but is
now generally conſidered by philoſophers as a ſpecies of lava; if it contains quartz, felt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpat,
and mica in diſtinct cryſtals, it is called granite; which is found in Cornwall in
rocks; and in looſe ſtones in the gravel near Drayton in Shropſhire, in the road towards
Newcaſtle. If theſe parts of the compoſition be leſs diſtinct, or if only two of them be
viſible to the eye, it is termed porphyry, trap, whinſtone, moorſtone, ſlate. And if it
appears in a regular angular form, it is called baſaltes. The affinity of theſe bodies has
lately been further well eſtabliſhed by Dr. Beddoes in the Phil. Tranſ. Vol. LXXX.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are all eſteemed to have been volcanic productions that have undergone different
degrees of heat; it is well known that in Papin's digeſter water may be made red hot by
confinement, and will then diſſolve many bodies which otherwiſe are little or not at all
acted upon by it. From hence it may be conceived, that under immenſe preſſure of
ſuperincumbent materials, and by great heat, theſe maſſes of lava may have undergone
a kind of aqueous ſolution, without any tendency to vitrification, and might thence have
a power of cryſtallization, whence all the varieties above mentioned from the different
proportion of the materials, or the different degrees of heat they may have undergone in
this aqueous ſolution. And that the uniformity of the mixture of the original earths,
as of lime, argil, ſilex, magneſia, and barytes, which they contain, was owing to their
boiling together a longer or ſhorter time before their elevation into mountains. See
note XIX. art. 8.</p>
                     <p>The ſeat of volcanos ſeems to be principally, if not entirely, in theſe ſtrata of granite;
as many of them are ſituated on granite mountains, and throw up from time to time
ſheets of lava which run down over the preceeding ſtrata from the ſame origin; and in
this they ſeem to differ from the heat which has ſeparated the clay, coal, and ſand in
moraſſes, which would appear to have riſen from a kind of fermentation, and thus to
have pervaded the whole maſs without any expuition of lava.</p>

All the lavas from Veſuvius contain one fourth part of iron, (Kirwan's Min.) and
all the five primitive earths, viz. calcareous, argillaceous, ſiliceous, barytic, and magneſian
earths, which are alſo evidently produced now daily from the recrements of animal and
vegetable bodies. What is to be thence concluded? Has the granite ſtratum in very
antient times been produced like the preſent calcareous and ſiliceous maſſes, according
to the ingenious theory of Dr. Hutton, who ſays new continents are now forming at the
bottom of the ſea to riſe in their turn, and that thus the terraqueous globe has been,
and will be, eternal? Or ſhall we ſuppoſe that this internal heated maſs of granite,
which forms the nucleus of the earth, was a part of the body of the ſun before it was
ſeparated by an exploſion? Or was the fun originally a planet, inhabited like ours, and a
ſatellite to ſome other greater fun, which has long been extinguiſhed by diffuſion of its
light, and around which the preſent ſun continues to revolve, according to a conjecture
of the celebrated Mr. Herſchell, and which conveys to the mind a moſt ſublime idea
of the progreſſive and increaſing excellence of the works of the Creator of all things?</p>
                     <p>For the more eaſy comprehenſion of the facts and conjectures concerning the ſituation
and production of the various ſtrata of the earth, I ſhall here ſubjoin a ſuppoſed ſection
of the globe, but without any attempt to give the proportions of the parts, or the
number of them, but only their reſpective ſituation over each other, and a geological
recapitulation.</p>
                     <div type="part">

                        <p>1. The earth was projected along with the other primary planets from the ſun,
which is ſuppoſed to be on fire only on its ſurface, emitting light without much internal
heat like a ball of burning camphor.</p>
                        <p>2. The rotation of the earth round its axis was occaſioned by its greater friction or
adheſion to one ſide of the cavity from which it was ejected; and from this rotation it
acquired its ſpheroidical form. As it cooled in its aſcent from the ſun its nucleus
became harder; and its attendant vapours were condenſed, forming the ocean.</p>
                        <p>3. The maſſes or mountains of granite, porphery, baſalt, and ſtones of ſimilar ſtructure,
were a part of the original nucleus of the earth; or conſiſt of volcanic productions
ſince formed.</p>
                        <p>4. On this nucleus of granite and baſaltes, thus covered by the ocean, were formed
the calcareous beds of limeſtone, marble, chalk, ſpar, from the exuviae of marine animals;
with the flints, or chertz, which accompany them. And were ſtratified by their having
been formed at different and very diſtant periods of time.</p>
                        <p>5. The whole terraqueous globe was burſt by central fires; iſlands and continents
were raiſed, conſiſting of granite or lava in ſome parts, and of limeſtone in others; and
great vallies were ſunk, into which the ocean retired.</p>
                        <p>6. During theſe central earthquakes the moon was ejected from the earth, cauſing
new tides; and the earth's axis ſuffered ſome change in its inclination, and its rotatory
motion was retarded.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0811300400:300"/>
7. On ſome parts of theſe iſlands and continents of granite or limeſtone were
gradually produced extenſive moraſſes from the recrements of vegetables and of land
animals; and from theſe moraſſes, heated by fermentation, were produced clay, marle,
ſandſtone, coal, iron, (with the baſes of variety of acids;) all which were ſtratified by
their having been formed at different, and very diſtant periods of time.</p>
                        <p>8. In the elevation of the mountains very numerous and deep fiſſures neceſſarily
were produced. In theſe fiſſures many of the metals are formed partly from deſcending
materials, and partly from aſcending ones raiſed in vapour by ſubterraneous fires. In
the fiſſures of granite or porphery quartz is formed; in the fiſſures of limeſtone
calcareous ſpar is produced.</p>
                        <p>9. During theſe firſt great volcanic fires it is probable the atmoſphere was either
produced, or much increaſed; a proceſs which is perhaps now going on in the moon;
Mr. Herſchell having diſcovered a volcanic crater three miles broad burning on her diſk.</p>
                        <p>10. The ſummits of the new mountains were cracked into innumerable lozenges
by the cold dews or ſnows falling upon them when red hot. From theſe ſummits,
which were then twice as high as at preſent, cubes and lozenges of granite, and baſalt,
and quartz in ſome countries, and of marble and flints in others, deſcended gradually
into the valleys, and were rolled together in the beds of rivers, (which were then ſo large
as to occupy the whole valleys, which they now only interſect;) and produced the
great beds of gravel, of which many valleys conſiſt.</p>
                        <p>11. In ſeveral parts of the earth's ſurface ſubſequent earthquakes, from the fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of moraſſes, have at different periods of time deranged the poſition of the matters
above deſcribed. Hence the gravel, which was before in the beds of rivers, has in
ſome places been raiſed into mountains, along with clay and coal ſtrata which were
formed from moraſſes and waſhed down from eminences into the beds of rivers or the
neighbouring ſeas, and in part raiſed again with gravel or marine ſhells over them;
but this has only obtained in few places compared with the general diſtribution of
ſuch materials. Hence there ſeem to have exiſted two ſources of earthquakes, which
have occurred at great diſtance of time from each other; one from the granite beds in
the central parts of the earth, and the other from the moraſſes on its ſurface. All the
ſubſequent earthquakes and volcanos of modern days compared with theſe are of ſmall
extent and inſignificant effect.</p>
                        <p>12. Beſides the argillaceous ſand-ſtone produced from moraſſes, which is ſtratified
with clay, and coal, and iron, other great beds of ſiliceous ſand have been formed in the
ſea by the combination of an unknown acid from moraſſes, and the calcareous matters
of the ocean.</p>
                        <p>13. The warm waters which are found in many countries, are owing to ſteam
ariſing from great depths through the fiſſures of limeſtone or lava, elevated by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean
fires, and condenſed between the ſtrata of the hills over them; and not from
any decompoſition of pyrites or manganeſe near the ſurface of the earth.</p>
                        <p>14. The columns of baſaltes have been raiſed by the congelation or expanſion of
granite beds in the act of cooling from their ſemi-vitreous fuſion.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>1. THE atmoſphere will diſſolve a certain quantity of moiſture as a chemical men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,
even when it is much below the freezing point, as appears from the diminution
of ice ſuſpended in froſty air, but a much greater quantity of water is evaporated and
ſuſpended in the air by means of heat, which is perhaps the univerſal cauſe of fluidity,
for water is known to boil with leſs heat in vacuo, which is a proof that it will evaporate
faſter in vacuo, and that the air therefore rather hinders than promotes its evaporation
in higher degrees of heat. The quick evaporation occaſioned in vacuo by a ſmall degree
of heat is agreeably ſeen in what is termed a pulſe-glaſs, which conſiſts of an exhauſted
tube of glaſs with a bulb at each end of it and with about two thirds of the cavity filled
with alcohol, in which the ſpirit is inſtantly ſeen to boil by the heat of the finger-end
applied on a bubble of ſteam in the lower bulb, and is condenſed again in the upper
bulb by the leaſt conceivable comparative coldneſs.</p>
                     <p>2. Another circumſtance evincing that heat is the principal cauſe of evaporation is
that at the time of water being converted into ſteam, a great quantity of heat is taken
away from the neighbouring bodies. If a thermometer be repeatedly dipped in ether, or
in rectified ſpirit of wine, and expoſed to a blaſt of air, to expedite the evaporation by
perpetually removing the ſaturated air from it, the thermometer will preſently ſink below
freezing. This warmth, taken from the ambient bodies at the time of evaporation by
the ſteam, is again given out when the ſteam is condenſed into water. Hence the water
in a worm-tub during diſtillation ſo ſoon becomes hot; and hence the warmth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
the deſcent of rain in cold weather.</p>
                     <p>3. The third circumſtance, ſhewing that heat is the principal cauſe of evaporation, is,
that ſome of the ſteam becomes again condenſed when any part of the heat is withdrawn.
Thus when warmer ſouth-weſt winds replete with moiſture ſucceed the colder north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt
winds all bodies that are denſe and ſubſtantial, as ſtone walls, brick floors, &amp;c. abſorb
ſome of the heat from the paſſing air, and its moiſture becomes precipitated on them,
while the north-eaſt winds become warmer on their arrival in this latitude, and are
thence diſpoſed to take up more moiſture, and are termed drying winds.</p>
                     <p>4. Heat ſeems to be the principal cauſe of the ſolution of many other bodies, as
common ſalt, or blue vitriol diſſolved in water, which when expoſed to ſevere cold are
precipitated, or carried, to the part of the water laſt frozen; this I obſerved in a phial
filled with a ſolution of blue vitriol which was frozen; the phial was burſt, the ice
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0811300400:302"/>
thawed, and a blue column of cupreous vitriol was left ſtanding upright on the bottom
of the broken glaſs, as deſcribed in note XIX.</p>
                     <p>II. Hence water may either be diſſolved in air, and may then be called an aerial
ſolution of water; or it may be diſſolved in the fluid matter of heat, according to the
theory of M. Lavoiſier, and may then be called ſteam. In the former caſe it is probable
there are many other vapours which may precipitate it, as marine acid gas, or fluor acid
gas. So alcaline gas and acid gas diſſolved in air precipitate each other, nitrous gas pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates
vital air from its azote, and inflammable gas mixed with vital air ignited by an
electric ſpark either produces or precipitates the water in both of them. Are there any
ſubtle exhalations occaſionally diffuſed in the atmoſphere which may thus cauſe rain?</p>
                     <p>1. But as water is perhaps many hundred times more ſoluble in the fluid matter of
heat than in air, I ſuppoſe the education of this heat, by whatever means it is occaſioned,
is the principal cauſe of devaporation. Thus if a region of air is brought from a
warmer climate, as the S. W. winds, it becomes cooled by its contact with the earth in
this latitude, and parts with ſo much of its moiſture as was diſſolved in the quantity of
calorique, or heat, which it now looſes, but retains that part which was ſuſpended by its
attraction to the particles of air, or by aerial ſolution, even in the moſt ſevere froſts.</p>
                     <p>2. A ſecond immediate cauſe of rain is a ſtream of N. E. wind deſcending from a
ſuperior current of air, and mixing with the warmer S. W. wind below; or the reverſe
of this, viz. a ſuperior current of S. W. wind mixing with an inferior one of N. E.
wind; in both theſe caſes the whole heaven becomes inſtantly clouded, and the moiſture
contained in the S. W. current is precipitated. This cauſe of devaporation has been
ingeniouſly explained by Dr. Hutton in the Tranſact. of Edinburgh, Vol. I. and ſeems
to ariſe from this circumſtance; the particles of air of the N. E. wind educe part of
the heat from the S. W. wind, and therefore the water which was diſſolved by that
quantity of <hi>heat</hi> is precipitated; all the other part of the water, which was ſuſpended
by its attraction to the particles of air, or diſſolved in the remainder of the heat, continues unprecipitated.</p>
                     <p>3. A third method by which a region of air becomes cooled, and in conſequence
depoſits much of its moiſture, is from the mechanical expanſion of air, when part of the
preſſure is taken off. In this caſe the expanded air becomes capable of receiving or
attracting more of the matter of heat into its interſtices, and the vapour, which was
previouſly diſſolved in this heat, is depoſited, as is ſeen in the receiver of an air-pump,
which becomes dewy, as the air within becomes expanded by the education of part of it.
See note VII. Hence when the mercury in the barometer ſinks without a change of
the wind the air generally becomes colder. See note VII. on Elementary Heat. And it
is probably from the varying preſſure of the incumbent air that in ſummer days ſmall
black clouds are often thus ſuddenly produced, and again ſoon vaniſh. See a paper in
Philos. Tranſ. Vol. LXXVIII. intitled Frigorific Experiments on the Mechanical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion
of Air.</p>

                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0811300400:303"/>
4. Another portion of atmoſpheric water may poſſibly be held in ſolution by the
electric fluid, ſince in thunder ſtorms a precipitation of the water ſeems to be either the
cauſe or the conſequence of the eduction of the electricity. But it appears more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the water is condenſed into clouds by the eduction of its heat, and that then
the ſurplus of electricity prevents their coaleſcence into larger drops, which immediately
ſucceeds the departure of the lightning.</p>
                     <p>5. The immediate cauſe why the barometer ſinks before rain is, firſt, becauſe a region
of warm air, brought to us in the place of the cold air which it had diſplaced, muſt
weigh lighter, both ſpecifically and abſolutely, if the height of the warm atmoſphere be
ſuppoſed to be equal to that or the preceeding cold one. And ſecondly, after the drops
of rain begin to fall in any column of air, that column becomes lighter, the falling drops
only adding to the prſſure of the air in proportion to the reſiſtance which they meet
with in paſſing through that fluid.</p>
                     <p>If we could ſuppoſe water to be diſſolved in air without heat, or in very low degrees
of heat, I ſuppoſe the air would become heavier, as happens in many chemical ſolution,
but if water diſſolved in the matter of heat, or calorique, be mixed with an aerial ſolutions,
of water, there can be no doubt but an atmoſphere conſiſting of ſuch a mixture muſt
become lighter in proportion to the quantity of calorique. On the ſame circumſtance
depends the viſible vapour produced from the breath of animals in cold weather, or
from a boiling kettle; the particles of cold air, with which it is mixed, ſteal a part
of its heat, and become themſelves raiſed in temperature, whence part of the water
is precipitated in viſible vapour, which, if in great quantity ſinks to the ground; if in
ſmall quantity, and the ſurrounding air is not previouſly ſaturated, it ſpreads itſelf till it
becomes again diſſolved.</p>

                     <p>THE ſurface of the earth conſiſts of ſtrata many of which were formed originally
beneath the ſea, the mountains were afterwards forced up by ſubterraneous fires, as
appears from the fillures in the rocks of which they conſiſt the quantity of volcanic
productions all over the world, and the numerous remains of craters of volcanos in
mountainous countries. Hence the ſtrata which compoſe the ſides of mountains lie
ſlanting downwards, and one or two or more of the external ſtrata not reaching to the
ſummit when the mountain was raiſed up, the ſecond or third ſtratum or a more inferior
one is there expoſed to day; this may be well repreſented by forceably thruſting a
blunt inſtrument through ſeveral ſheets of paper, a bur will ſtand up with the lowermoſt
ſheet ſtanding higheſt in the center of it. On this uppermoſt ſtratum, which is colder as
it is more elevated, the dews are condenſed in large quantities; and ſliding down paſs
under the firſt or ſecond or third ſtratum which compoſe the ſides of the hill; and either
form a moraſs below, or a weeping rock, by oozing out in numerous places, or many
of theſe leſs currents meeting together burſt out in a more copious rill.</p>
                     <p>The ſummits of mountains are much colder than the plains in their vicinity, owing
to ſeveral cauſes; 1. Their being in a manner inſulated or cut off from the common
heat of the earth, which is always of 48 degrees, and perpetually counteracts the effects
of external cold beneath that degree. 2. From their ſurfaces being larger in proportion
to their ſolid contents, and hence their heat more expeditiouſly carried away by the
ever-moving atmoſphere. 3. The increaſing rarity of the air as the mountain riſes.
All thoſe bodies which conduct electricity well or ill, conduct the matter of heat likewiſe
well or ill. See note VII. Atmoſpheric air is a bad conductor of electricity and thence
confines it on the body where it is accumulated, but when it is made very rare, as in the
exhauſted receiver, the electric aura paſſes away immediately to any diſtance. The
ſame circumſtance probably happens in reſpect to heat, which is thus kept by the denſer
air on the plains from eſcaping, but is diſſipated on the hills where the air is thinner.
4. As the currents of air riſe up the ſides of mountains they become mechanically
rarefied, the preſſure of the incumbent column leſſening as they aſcend. Hence the
expanding air abſorbs heat from the mountain as it aſcends, as explained in note VII.
5. There is another, and perhaps more powerful cauſe, I ſuſpect, which may occaſion
the great cold on mountains, and in the higher parts of the atmoſphere, and which has
not yet been attended to; I mean that the fluid matter of heat may prodably gravitate
round the earth, and form an atmoſphere on its ſurface, mixed with the aerial atmoſphere,
which may diminiſh or become rarer, as it recedes from the earth's ſurface, in a greater
proportion than the air diminiſhes.</p>

                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0811300400:305"/>
6. The great condenſation of moiſture on the ſummits of hills has another cauſe,
which is the daſhing of moving clouds againſt them, in miſty days this is often ſeen
to have great effect on plains, where an eminent tree by obſtructing the miſt as it
moves along ſhall have a much greater quantity of moiſture drop from its leaves than
falls at the ſame time on the ground in its vicinity. Mr. White, in his Hiſtory of
Selborne gives an account of a large tree ſo ſituated, from which a ſtream flowed during
a moving miſt ſo as to fill the cart-ruts in a lane otherwiſe not very moiſt, and ingeniouſly
adds, that trees planted about ponds of ſtagnant water contribute much by theſe means
to ſupply the reſervoir. The ſpherules which conſtitute a miſt or cloud are kept from
uniting by ſo ſmall a power that a little agitation againſt the leaves of a tree, or the
greater attraction of a flat moiſt ſurface, condenſes or precipitates them.</p>
                     <p>If a leaf has its ſurface moiſtened and particles of water ſeparate from each other
as in a miſt be brought near the moiſtened ſurface of a leaf, each particle will be attracted
more by that plain ſurface of water on the leaf than it can be by the ſurrounding
particles of the miſt, becauſe globules only attract each other in one point, whereas a
plain attracts a globule by a greater extent of its ſurface.</p>
                     <p>The common cold ſprings are thus formed on elevated grounds by the condenſed
vapours, and hence are ſtronger when the nights are cold after hot days in ſpring, than
even in the wet days of winter. For the warm atmoſphere during the day has diſſolved
much more water than it can ſupport in ſolution during the cold of the night, which is
thus depoſited in large quantities on the hills, and yet ſo gradually as to ſoak in between
the ſtrata of them, rather than to ſlide off over their ſurfaces like ſhowers of rain.
The common heat of the internal parts of the earth is aſcertained by ſprings which
ariſe from ſtrata of earth too deep to be affected by the heat of ſummer or the froſts of
winter. Thoſe in this country are of 48 degrees of heat, thoſe about Philidelphia were ſaid
by Dr. Franklin to be 52; whether this variation is to be accounted for by the difference
of the ſun's heat on that country, according to the ingenious theory of Mr. Kirwan, or to
the vicinity of ſubterranean fires is not yet, I think, decided. There are however ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
ſtreams of water not exactly produced in this manner, as ſtreams iſſuing from
fiſſures in the earth, communicating with the craters of old volcanoes; in the Peak of
Derbyſhire are many hollows, called ſwallows, where the land floods ſink into the
earth, and come out at ſome miles diſtant, as at Ilam near Aſhborne. See note on
Fica, Vol. II.</p>
                     <p>Other ſtreams of cold water ariſe from beneath the ſnow on the Alps and Andes,
and other high mountains, which is perpetualy thawing at its under ſurface by the
common heat of the earth, and gives riſe to large rivers. For the origin of warm ſprings

                     <p>There is a kind of Nautilus, called by Linneus, Argonauta, whoſe ſhell has but one
cell; of this animal Pliny affirms, that having exonerated its ſhell by throwing out the
water, it ſwims upon the ſurface, extending a web of wonderful tenuity, and bending back
two of its arms and rowing with the reſt, makes a ſail, and at length receiving the water
dives again. Plin. IX. 29. Linneus adds to his deſcription of this animal, that like the
the Crab Diogenes or Bernhard, it occupies a houſe not its own, as it is not connected
to its ſhell, and is therefore foreign to it; who could have given credit to this if it had
not been atteſted by ſo many who have with their own eyes ſeen this argonaut in the
act of ſailing? Syſt. Nat. p. 1161.</p>
                     <p>The Nautilus, properly ſo named by Linneus, has a ſhell conſiſting of many cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
of which cups are made in the Eaſt with beautiful painting and carving on the
mother-pearl. The animal is ſaid to inhabit only the uppermoſt or open chamber, which
is larger than the reſt; and that the reſt remain empty except that the pipe, or ſiphun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,
which communicates from one to the other of them is filled with an appendage of
the animal like a gut or ſtring. Mr. Hook in his Philos. Exper. p. 306, imagines this to
be a dilatable or compreſſible tube, like the air-bladders of fiſh, and that by contracting
or permitting it to expand, it renders its ſhell boyant or the contrary. See Note on Ulva,
Vol. II.</p>
                     <p>The Pinna, or Sea-wing, is contained in a two-valve ſhell, weighing ſometimes fifteen
pounds, and emits a beard of fine long gloſſy ſilk-like fibres, by which it is ſuſpended to
the rocks twenty or thirty feet beneath the ſurface of the ſea. In this ſituation it is ſo
ſucceſsfully attacked by the eight-footed Polypus, that the ſpecies perhaps could not exiſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0811300400:307"/>
but for the exertions of the Cancer Pinnotheris, who lives in the ſame ſhell as a guard
and companion. Amoen. Academ. Vol. II. p. 48. Lin. Syſt. Nat. Vol. I. p. 1159, and
p. 1040.</p>
                     <p>The Pinnotheris, or Pinnophylax, is a ſmall crab naked like Bernard the Hermit, but
is furniſhed with good eyes, and lives in the ſame ſhell with the Pinna; when they want
food the Pinna opens its ſhell, and ſends its faithful ally to forage; but if the Cancer
ſees the Polypus, he returns ſuddenly to the arms of his blind hoſteſſs, who by cloſing the
ſhell avoids the fury of her enemy; otherwiſe, when it has procured a booty, it brings it
to the opening of the ſhell, where it is admitted, and they divide the prey. This was
obſerved by Haſlequiſt in his voyage to Paleſtine.</p>
                     <p>The Byſſus of the antients, according to Ariſtotle, was the beard of the Pinna above
mentioned, but ſeems to have been uſed by other writers indiſcriminately for any ſpun
material, which was eſteemed finer or more valuable than wool. Reaumur ſays the
threads of this Byſſus are not leſs fine or leſs beautiful than the ſilk, as it is ſpun by the
ſilk-worm; the Pinna on the coaſts of Italy and Provence (where it is fiſhed up by iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks
fixed on long poles) is called the ſilk-worm of the ſea. The ſtockings and gloves
manufactured from it, are of exquiſite fineneſs, but too warm for common wear, and are
thence eſteemed uſeful in rhumatiſm and gout. Dict. Raiſonné art. Pinne-marine. The
warmth of the Byſſus, like that of ſilk, is probably owing to their being bad conductors
of heat, as well as of electricity. When theſe fibres are broken by violence, this animal
as well as the muſcle has the power to reproduce them like the common ſpiders, as was
obſerved by M. Adanſon. As raw ſilk, and raw cobwebs, when ſwallowed, are liable to
produce great ſickneſs (as I am informed) it is probable the part of muſcles, which
ſometimes diſagrees with the people who eat them, may be this ſilky web, by which
they attach themſelves to ſtones. The large kind of Pinna contains ſome mother-pearl
of a reddiſh tinge, according to M. d'Argenville. The ſubſtance ſold under the name
of Indian weed, and uſed at the bottom of fiſh-lines, is probably a production of this
kind, which however is ſcarcely to be diſtinguiſhed by the eye from the tendons of a
rat's tail, after they have been ſeparated by putrefaction in water, and well cleaned and
rubbed; a production, which I was once ſhewn as a great curioſity; it had the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
bone of the tail adhering to it, and was ſaid to have been uſed as an ornament
in a lady's hair.</p>

as well as of great importance; his mouth is placed under the head, without teeth,
like the opening of a purſe, which he has the power to puſh ſuddenly out or retract.
Before this mouth under the beak or noſe hang four tendrils ſome inches long, and which
ſo reſemble earth-worms that at firſt ſight they may be miſtaken for them. This clumſy
toothleſs fiſh is ſuppoſed by this contrivance to keep himſelf in good condition, the
ſolidity of his fleſh evidently ſhewing him to be a fiſh of prey. He is ſaid to hide his
large body amongſt the weeds near the ſea-coaſt, or at the mouths of large rivers, only
expoſing his cirrhi or tendrils, which ſmall fiſh or ſea-inſects miſtaking for real worms
approach for plunder, and are ſucked into the jaws of their enemy. He has been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by ſome to root into the ſoil at the bottom of the ſea or rivers; but the cirrhi, or
tendrills abovementioned, which hang from his ſnout over his mouth, muſt themſelves
be very inconvenient for this purpoſe, and as it has no jaws it evidently lives by ſuction,
and during its reſidence in the ſea a quantity of ſea-inſects are found in its ſtomach.</p>
                     <p>The fleſh was ſo valued in the time of the Emperor Severus, that it was brought to
table by ſervants with coronets on their heads, and preceded by muſic, which might give
riſe to its being in our country preſented by the Lord Mayor to the King. At preſent it
is caught in the Danube, and the Walga, the Don, and other large rivers for various pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.
The ſkin makes the beſt covering for carriages; iſinglaſs is prepared from parts
of the ſkin; cavear from the ſpawn; and the fleſh is pickled or ſalted, and ſent all over

                     </q>
                     <p>THERE is reaſon to believe that when oil is poured upon water, the two ſurfaces
do not touch each other, but that the oil is ſuſpended over the water by their mutual
repulſion. This ſeems to be rendered probable by the following experiment: if one
drop of oil be droped on a baſon of water, it will immediately diffuſe itſelf over the whole,
for there being no friction between the two ſurfaces, there is nothing to prevent its
ſpreading itſelf by the gravity of the upper part of it, except its own tenacity, into a pellicle
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0811300400:309"/>
of the greateſt tenuity. But if a ſecond drop of oil be put upon the former, it does not
ſpread itſelf, but remains in the form of a drop, as the other already occupied the whole
ſurface of the baſon, and there is friction in oil paſſing over oil, though none in oil
paſſing over water.</p>
                     <p>Hence when oil is diffuſed on the ſurface of water gentle breezes have no influence in
raiſing waves upon it; for a ſmall quantity of oil will cover a very great ſurface of water,
(I ſuppoſe a ſpoonful will diffuſe itſelf over ſome acres) and the wind blowing upon this
carries it gradually forwards; and there being no friction between the two ſurfaces the
water is not affected. On which account oil has no effect in ſtilling the agitation of the
water after the wind ceaſes, as was found by the experiments of Dr. Franklin.</p>
                     <p>This circumſtance lately brought into notice by Dr. Franklin had been mentioned by
Pliny, and is ſaid to be in uſe by the divers for pearls, who in windy weather taken down
with them a little oil in their mouths, which they occaſionally give out when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality
of the ſupernatant waves prevents them from ſeeing ſufficiently diſtinctly for their
purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The wonderful tenuity with which oil can be ſpread upon water is evinced by a
few drops projected from a bridge, where the eye is properly placed over it, paſſing
through all the priſmatic colours as it diffuſes itſelf. And alſo from another curious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
of Dr. Franklin's: he cut a piece of cork to about the ſize of a letter-wafer,
leaving a point ſtanding off like a tangent at one edge of the circle. This piece of cork
was then dipped in oil and thrown into a large pond of water, and as the oil flowed off at
the point, the cork-wafer continued to revolve in a contrary direction for ſeveral minutes.
The oil flowing off all that time at the pointed tangent in coloured ſtreams. In a ſmall
pond of water this experiment does not ſo well ſucceed, as the circulation of the cork
ſtops as ſoon as the water becomes covered with the pellicle of oil. See Additional
Note, No. XIII. and Note on Fucus, Vol. II.</p>
                     <p>The eaſe with which oil and water ſlide over each other is agreeably ſeen if a phial be
about half filled with equal parts of oil and water, and made to oſcillate ſuſpended by a
ſtring, the upper ſurface of the oil and the lower one of the water will always keep
ſmooth; but the agitation of the ſurfaces where the oil and water meet, is curious; for
their ſpecific gravities being not very different, and their friction on each other nothing,
the higheſt ſide of the water, as the phial deſcends in its oſcillation, having acquired a
greater momentum than the loweſt ſide (from its having deſcended further) would riſe
the higheſt on the aſcending ſide of the oſcillation, and thence puſhes the then uppermoſt
part of the water amongſt the oil.</p>

and angular behind. The ſhell is taper, winding, penetrating ſhips and ſubmarine

Tarieres, or ſea-worms, attack and erode ſhips with ſuch fury, and in ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
as often greatly to endanger them. It is ſaid that our veſſels have not known
this new enemy above fifty years, that they were brought from the ſea about the
Antilles to our parts of the ocean, where they have increaſed prodigiouſly. They bore
their paſſage in the direction of the fibres of the wood, which is their nouriſhment, and
cannot return or paſs obliquely, and thence when they come to a knot in the wood, or

                     <p>ON the coaſt of Norway there is an extenſive vortex, or eddy, which lies between the
iſlands of Moſkoe and Moſkenas, and is called Moſkoeſtrom, or Maelſtrom; it occupies
ſome leagues in circumference, and is ſaid to be very dangerous and often deſtructive
to veſſels navigating theſe ſeas. It is not eaſy to underſtand the exiſtence of a
conſtant deſcending ſtream without ſuppoſing it muſt paſs through a ſubterranean
cavity to ſome other part of the earth or ocean which may lie beneath its level; as the
Mediterranean ſeems to lie beneath the level of the Atlantic ocean, which therefore
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0811300400:311"/>
conſtantly flows into it through the Straits; and the waters of the Gulph of Mexico
lie much above the level of the ſea about the Floridas and further northward, which
gives riſe to the Gulph-ſtream, as deſcribed in note on Caſſia in Vol. II.</p>
                     <p>The Maelſtrom is ſaid to be ſtill twice in about twenty-four hours when the tide is
up, and moſt violent at the oppoſite times of the day. This is not difficult to account
for, ſince when ſo much water is brought over the ſubterraneous paſſage, if ſuch exiſts,
as compleatly to fill it and ſtand many feet above it, leſs diſturbance muſt appear on the
ſurface. The Maelſtrom is deſcribed in the Memoires of the Swediſh Academy of
Sciences, and Pontoppiden's Hiſt. of Norway, and in Univerſal Muſeum for 1763,
p. 131.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why eddies of water become hollow in the middle is becauſe the water
immediately over the centre of the well, or cavity, falls faſter, having leſs friction to
oppoſe its deſcent, than the water over the circumference or edges of the well. The
circular motion or gyration of eddies depends on the obliquity of the courſe of the
ſtream, or to the friction or oppoſition to it being greater on one ſide of the well than
the other; I have obſerved in water paſſing through a hole in the bottom of a trough,
which was always kept full, the gyration of the ſtream might be turned either way by
increaſing the oppoſition of one ſide of the eddy with ones finger, or by turning the
ſpout, through which the water was introduced, a little more obliquely to the hole on
one ſide or on the other. Lighter bodies are liable to be retained long in eddies of
water, while thoſe rather heavier than water are ſoon thrown out beyond the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
by their acquired momentum becoming greater than that of the water. Thus if
equal portions of oil and water be put into a phial, and by means of a ſtring be whirled
in a circle round the hand, the water will always keep at the greater diſtance from the
centre, whence in the eddies formed in rivers during a flood a perſon who endeavours
to keep above water or to ſwim is liable to be detained in them, but on ſuffering himſelf
to ſink or dive he is ſaid readily to eſcape. This circulation of water in deſcending
through a hole in a veſſel Dr. Franklin has ingeniouſly applied to the explanation of
hurricanes or eddies of air.</p>

                     <p>THE common heat of the interior parts of the earth being always 48 degrees, both in
winter and ſummer, the ſnow which lies in contact with it is always in a thawing ſtate;
Hence in ice-houſes the external parts of the collection of ice is perpetually thawing and
thus preſerves the internal part of it; ſo that it is neceſſary to lay up many tons for the
preſervation of one ton. Hence in Italy conſiderable rivers have their ſource from
beneath the eternal glaciers, or mountains of ſnow and ice.</p>
                     <p>In our country when the air in the courſe of a froſt continues a day or two at very
near 32 degrees, the common heat of the earth thaws the ice on its ſurface, while the
thermometer remains at the freezing point. This circumſtance is often obſervable in
the rimy mornings of ſpring; the thermometer ſhall continue at the freezing point,
yet all the rime will vaniſh, except that which happens to lie on a bridge, a board, or on
a cake of cow-dung, which being thus as it were inſulated or cut off from ſo free a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with the common heat of the earth by means of the air under the bridge, or
wood, or dung, which are bad conductors of heat, continues ſome time longer unthawed.
Hence when the ground is covered thick with ſnow, though the froſt continues, and the
ſun does not ſhine, yet the ſnow is obſerved to decreaſe very ſenſibly. For the common
heat of the earth melts the under ſurface of it, and the upper one evaporates by its
ſolution in the air. The great evaporation of ice was obſerved by Mr. Boyle, which
experiment I repeated ſome time ago. Having ſuſpended a piece of ice by a wire and
weighed it with care without touching it with my hand, I hung it out the whole of a
clear froſty night, and ſound in the morning it had loſt nearly a fifth of its weight.
Mr. N. Wallerius has ſince obſerved that ice at the time of its congelation evaporates
faſter than water in its fluid form; which may be accounted for from the heat given out
at the inſtant of freezing; (Sauſſure's Eſſais ſur Hygromet. p. 249.) but this effect is
only momentary.</p>
                     <p>Thus the vegetables that are covered with ſnow are ſeldom injured; ſince, as they
lie between the thawing ſnow, which has 32 degrees of heat, and the covered earth
which has 48, they are preſerved in a degree of heat between theſe; viz. in 40 degrees of
heat. Whence the moſs on which the rein-deer feed in the northern latitudes vegetates
beneath the ſnow; (See note on Muſchus, Vol. II.) and hence many Lapland and Alpine
plants periſhed through cold in the botanic garden at Upſal, for in their native ſituations,
though the cold is much more intenſe, yet at its very commencement they are covered
deep with ſnow, which remains till late in the ſpring. For this fact ſee Amaenit.

                     <p>THE theory of the winds is yet very imperfect, in part perhaps owing to the want
of obſervations ſufficiently numerous of the exact times and places where they begin and
ceaſe to blow, but chiefly to our yet imperfect knowledge of the means by which great
regions of air are either ſuddenly produced or ſuddenly deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>The air is perpetually ſubject to increaſe or diminution from its combination with
other bodies, or its evolution from them. The vital part of the air, called oxygene, is
continually produced in this climate from the perſpiration of vegetables in the ſunſhine,
and probably from the action of light on clouds or on water in the tropical climates,
where the ſun has greater power, and may exert ſome yet umknown laws of luminous
combination. Another part of the atmoſphere, which is called azote, is perpetually ſet
at liberty from animal and vegetable bodies by putrefaction or combuſtion, from many
ſprings of water, from volatile alcali, and probably from fixed alcali, of which there is an
exhauſtleſs ſource in the water of the ocean. Both theſe component parts of the air are
perpetually again diminiſhed by their contact with the ſoil, which covers the ſurface
of the earth, producing nitre. The oxygene is diminiſhed in the production of all acids,
of which the carbonic and muriatic exiſt in great abundance. The azote is diminiſhed
in the growth of animal bodies, of which it conſtitutes an important part, and in its
combinations with many other natural productions.</p>
                     <p>They are both probably diminiſhed in immenſe quantities by uniting with the
inflammable air, which ariſes from the mud of rivers and lakes at ſome ſeaſons, when
the atmoſphere is light: the oxgene of the air producing water, and the azote producing
volatile alcali by their combinations with this inflammable air. At other ſeaſons of the
year theſe principles may again change their combinations, and the atmoſpheric air be
reproduced.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Lavoiſier found that one pound of charcoal in burning conſumed two pounds
nine ounces of vital air, or oxygene. The conſumption of vital air in the proceſs of
making red lead may readily be reduced to calculation; a ſmall barrel contains about
twelve hundred weight of this commodity, 1200 pounds of lead by calcination abſorb
about 144 pounds of vital air; now as a cubic foot of water weighs 1000 averdupois
ounces, and as vital air is above 800 times lighter than water, it follows that every barrel
of red lead contains nearly 2000 cubic feet of vital air. If this can be performed in
miniature in a ſmall oven, what may not be done in the immenſe elaboratories of
nature!</p>
                     <p>Theſe great elaboratories of nature include almoſt all her foſſil as well as her animal
and vegetable productions. Dr. Prieſtley obtained air of greater or leſs purity, both
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0811300400:314"/>
vital and azotic, from almoſt all the foſſil ſubſtances he ſubjected to experiment. Four

                     <p>In this account the fixed air was previouſly extracted from the limeſtones by acids,
and the heat applied was much leſs than was neceſſary to extract all the air from the
bodies employed. Add to this the known quantities of air which are combined with the
calciform ores, as the ochres of iron, manganeſe, calamy, grey ore of lead, and ſome idea
may be formed of the great production of air in volcanic eruptions, as mentioned in
note on Chunda, Vol. II. and of the perpetual abſorptions and evolutions of whole
oceans of air from every part of the earth.</p>
                     <p>But there would ſeem to be an officina aeris, a ſhop where air is both manufactured
and deſtroyed in the greateſt abundance within the polar circles, as will hereafter be ſpoken
of. Can this be effected by ſome yet unknown law of the congelation of aqueous or
ſaline fluids, which may ſet at liberty their combined heat, and convert a part both of
the acid and alcali of ſea-water into their component airs? Or on the contrary can the
electricity of the northern lights convert inflammable air and oxygene into water, whilſt
the great degree of cold at the poles unites the azote with ſome other baſe? Another
officina aeris, or manufacture of air, would ſeem to exiſt within the tropics or at the
line, though in a much leſs quantity than at the poles, owing perhaps to the action of
the ſun's light on the moiſture ſuſpended in the air, as will alſo be ſpoken of hereafter;
but in all other parts of the earth theſe abſorptions and evolutions of air in a greater or
leſs degree are perpetually going on in inconceivable abundance; increaſed probably, and
diminiſhed at different ſeaſons of the year by the approach or retroceſſion of the ſun's
light; future diſcoveries muſt elucidate this part of the ſubject. To this ſhould be added
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0811300400:315"/>
that as heat and electricity, and perhaps magnetiſm, are known to diſplace air, that it is
not impoſſible but that the increaſed or diminiſhed quantities of theſe fluids diffuſed in
the atmoſphere may increaſe its weight a well as its bulk; ſince their ſpecific attractions
or affinities to matter are very ſtrong, they probably alſo poſſeſs general gravitation to the
earth; a ſubject which wants further inveſtigation. See Note XXVI.</p>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>SOUTH-WEST WINDS.</head>
                        <p>The velocity of the ſurface of the earth in moving round its axis diminiſhes from the
equator to the poles. Whence if a region of air in this country ſhould be ſuddenly
removed a few degrees towards the north it muſt conſtitute a weſtern wind, becauſe
from the velocity it had previouſly acquired in this climate by its friction with the earth
it would for a time move quicker than the ſurface of the country it was removed to;
the contrary muſt enſue when a region of air is tranſported from this country a few
degrees ſouthward, becauſe the velocity it had acquired in this climate would be leſs
than that of the earth's ſurface where it was removed to, whence it would appear to
conſtitute a wind from the eaſt, while in reality the eminent parts of the earth would
be carried againſt the too ſlow air. But if this tranſportation of air from ſouth to north
be performed gradually, the motion of the wind will blow in the diagonal between
ſouth and weſt. And on the contrary if a region of air be gradually removed from
north to ſouth it would alſo blow diagonally between the north and eaſt, from whence we
may ſafely conclude that all our winds in this country which blow from the north or eaſt,
or any point between them, conſiſt of regions of air brought from the north; and that
all our winds blowing from the ſouth or weſt, or from any point between them, are
regions of air brought from the ſouth.</p>
                        <p>It frequently happens during the vernal months that after a north-eaſt wind has
paſſed over us for ſeveral weeks, during which time the barometer has ſtood at above
30 ½ inches, it becomes ſuddenly ſucceeded by a ſouth-weſt wind, which alſo continues
ſeveral weeks, and the barometer ſinks to nearly 28 ½ inches. Now as two inches of
the mercury in the barometer balance one-fifteenth part of the whole atmoſphere, an
important queſtion here preſents itſelf, <hi>what is become of all this air.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. This great quantity of air can not be carried in a ſuperior current towards the
line, while the inferior current flows towards the poles, becauſe then it would equally
affect the barometer, which ſhould not therefore ſubſide from 30 ½ inches to 28 ½ for
ſix weeks together.</p>
                        <p>2. It cannot be owing to the air having loſt all the moiſture which was previouſly
diſſolved in it, becauſe theſe warm ſouth-weſt winds are replete with moiſture, and the
cold north-eaſt winds, which weigh up the mercury in the barometer to 31 inches,
conſiſt of dry air.</p>
                        <p>3. It can not be carried over the polar regions and be accumulated on the meridian
oppoſite to us in its paſſage towards the line, as ſuch an accumulation would equal
one-fifteenth of the whole atmoſphere, and can not be ſuppoſed to remain in that
ſituation for ſix weeks together,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0811300400:316"/>
4. It can not depend on the exiſtence of tides in the atmoſphere, ſince it muſt then
correſpond to lunar periods. Nor to accumulations of air from the ſpecific levity of
the upper regions of the atmoſphere, ſince its degree of fluidity muſt correſpond with its
tenuity, and conſequently ſuch great mountains of air can not be ſuppoſed to exiſt for
ſo many weeks together as the ſouth-weſt winds ſometimes continue.</p>
                        <p>5. It remains therefore that there muſt be at this time a great and ſudden abſorption
of air in the polar circle by ſome unknown operation of nature, and that the ſouth
wind runs in to ſupply the deficiency. Now as this ſouth wind conſiſts of air brought
from a part of the earth's ſurface which moves faſter than it does in this climate it
muſt have at the ſame time a direction from the weſt by retaining part of the velocity
it had previouſly acquired. Theſe ſouth-weſt winds coming from a warmer country,
and becoming colder by their contact with the earth of this climate, and by their
evpanſion, (ſo great a part of the ſuperincumbent atmoſphere having vaniſhed,) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
their moiſture; and as they continue for ſeveral weeks to be abſorbed in the
polar circle would ſeem to receive a perpetual ſupply from the tropical regions, eſpecially
over the line, as will hereafter be ſpoken of.</p>
                        <p>It may ſometimes happen that a north-eaſt wind having paſſed over us may be
bent down and driven back before it has acquired any heat from the climate, and may
thus for a few hours or a day have a ſouth-weſt direction, and from its deſcending
from a higher region of the atmoſphere may poſſeſs a greater degree of cold than an
inferior north-eaſt current of air.</p>
                        <p>The extreme cold of Jan. 13, 1709, at Paris came on with a gentle ſouth wind,
and was diminiſhed when the wind changed to the north, which is accounted for by
Mr. Homberg from a reflux of air which had been flowing for ſome time from the
north. Chemical Eſſays by R. Watſon, Vol. V. p. 182.</p>
                        <p>It may happen that a north-eaſt current may for a day or two paſs over us and
produce inceſſant rain by mixing with the inferior ſouth-weſt current; but this as
well as the former is of ſhort duration, as its friction will ſoon carry the inferior current
along with it, and dry or froſty weather will then ſucceed.</p>

                     <div type="part">

                        <p>The north-eaſt winds of this country conſiſt of regions of air from the north,
travelling ſometimes at the rate of about a mile in two minutes during the vernal
months for ſeveral weeks together from the polar regions toward the ſouth, the
mercury in the barometer ſtanding above 30. Theſe winds conſiſt of air greatly
cooled by the evaporation of the ice and ſnow over which it paſſes, and as they become
warmer by their contact with the earth of this climate are capable of diſſolving more
moiſture as they paſs along, and are thence attended with froſts in winter and with dry
hot weather in ſummer.</p>
                        <p>1. This great quantity of air can not be ſupplied by ſuperior currents paſſing in a
contrary direction from ſouth to north, becauſe ſuch currents muſt as they ariſe into
the atmoſphere a mile or two high become expoſed to ſo great cold as to occaſion them
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0811300400:317"/>
to depoſit their moiſture, which would fall through the inferior current upon the earth
in ſome part of their paſſage.</p>
                        <p>2. The whole atmoſphere muſt have increaſed in quantity, becauſe it appears by
the barometer that there exiſts one-fifteenth part more air over us for many weeks
together, which could not be thus accumulated by difference of temperature in reſpect
to heat, or by any aeroſtatic laws at preſent known, or by any lunar influence.</p>
                        <p>From whence it would appear that immenſe maſſes of air were ſet at liberty from
their combinations with ſolid bodies, along with a ſufficient quantity of combined heat,
within the polar circle, or in ſome region to the north of us; and that they thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
increaſe the quantity of the atmoſphere; and that this is again at certain times
re-abſorbed, or enters into new combinations at the line or tropical regions. By which
wonderful contrivance the atmoſphere is perpetually renewed and rendered fit for the
ſupport of animal and vegetable life.</p>

                        <p>The ſouth-eaſt winds of this country conſiſt of air from the north which had paſſed
by us, or over us, and before it had obtained the velocity of the earth's ſurface in this
climate had been driven back, owing to a deficiency of air now commencing at the
polar regions. Hence theſe are generally dry or freezing winds, and if they ſucceed
north-eaſt winds ſhould prognoſticate a change of wind from north-eaſt to ſouth-weſt;
the barometer is generally about 30. They are ſometimes attended with cloudy
weather, or rain, owing to their having acquired an increaſed degree of warmth and
moiſture before they became retrograde; or to their being mixed with air from the
ſouth.</p>
                        <p>2. Sometimes theſe ſouth-eaſt winds conſiſt of a vertical eddy of north-eaſt air,
without any mixture of ſouth-weſt air; in that caſe the barometer continues above 30,
and the weather is dry or froſty for four or five days together.</p>
                        <p>It ſhould here be obſerved, that air being an elaſtic fluid muſt be more liable to eddies
than water, and that theſe eddies muſt extend into cylinders or vortexes of greater
diameter, and that if a vertical eddy of north-eaſt air be of ſmall diameter or has paſſed
but a little way to the ſouth of us before its return, it will not have gained the velocity
of the earth's ſurface to the ſouth of us, and will in conſequence become a ſouth-eaſt
wind.—But if the vertical eddy be of large diameter, or has paſſed much to the ſouth of
us, it will have acquired velocity from its friction with the earth's ſurface to the ſouth
of us, and will in conſequence on its return become a ſouth-weſt wind, producing great
cold.</p>

                        <head>NORTH-WEST WINDS.</head>
                        <p>There ſeem to be three ſources of the north-weſt winds of this hemiſphere of the
earth. 1. When a portion of ſouthern air, which was paſſing over us, is driven back
by accumulation of new air in the polar regions. In this cafe I ſuppoſe they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
moiſt or rainy winds, with the barometer under 30, and if the wind had previouſly
been in the ſouth-weſt, it would ſeem to prognoſticate a change to the north-eaſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0811300400:318"/>
2. If a current of north wind is paſſing over us but a few miles high, without any
eaſterly direction; and is bent down upon us, it muſt immediately poſſeſs a weſterly
direction, becauſe it will now move faſter than the ſurface of the earth where it arrives;
and thus becomes changed from a north-eaſt to a north-weſt wind. This deſcent of a
north-eaſt current of air producing a north-weſt wind may continue ſome days with
clear or freezing weather, as it may be ſimply owing to a vertical eddy of north-eaſt
air, as will be ſpoken of below. It may otherwiſe be forced down by a current of
ſouth-weſt wind paſſing over it, and in this caſe it will be attended with rain for a few
days by the mixture of the two airs of different degrees of heat; and will prognoſticate a
change of wind from north-eaſt to ſouth-weſt if the wind was previouſly in the north-eaſt
quarter.</p>
                        <p>3. On the eaſtern coaſt of North America the north-weſt winds bring froſt, as the
north-eaſt winds do in this country, as appears from variety of teſtimony. This ſeems
to happen from a vertical ſpiral eddy made in the atmoſphere between the ſhore and the
ridge of mountains which form the ſpine or back-bone of that continent. If a current
of water runs along the hypothenuſe of a triangle an eddy will be made in the included
angle, which will turn round like a water-wheel as the ſtream paſſes in contact with
one edge of it. The ſame muſt happen when a ſheet of air flowing along from the
north-eaſt riſes from the ſhore in a ſtraight line to the ſummit of the Apalachian
mountains, a part of the ſtream of north-eaſt air will flow over the mountains, another
part will revert and circulate ſpirally between the ſummit of the country and the eaſtern
ſhore, continuing to move toward the ſouth; and thus be changed from a north-eaſt to
a north-weſt wind.</p>
                        <p>This vertical ſpiral eddy having been in contact with the cold ſummits of theſe
mountains, and deſcending from higher parts of the atmoſphere will loſe part of its
heat, and thus conſtitute one cauſe of the greater coldneſs of the eaſtern ſides of North
America than of the European ſhores oppoſite to them, which is ſaid to be equal to
twelve degrees of north latitude, which is a wonderful fact, not otherwiſe eaſy to be
explained, ſince the heat of the ſprings at Philadelphia is ſaid to be 52, which is greater
than the medium heat of the earth in this country.</p>
                        <p>The exiſtence of vertical eddies, or great cylinders of air rolling on the ſurface of
the earth, is agreeable to the obſervations of the conſtructors of windmills; who on
this idea place the area of the fails leaning backwards, inclined to the horizon; and
believe that then they have greater power than when they are placed quite perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly.
The ſame kind of rolling cylinders of water obtain in rivers owing to the
friction of the water againſt the earth at their bottoms; as is known by bodies having
been obſerved to float upon their ſurfaces quicker than when immerſed to a certain
depth. Theſe vertical eddies of air probably exiſt all over the earth's ſurface, but
particularly at the bottom or ſides of mountains; and more ſo probably in the courſe
of the ſouth-weſt than of the north-eaſt winds; becauſe the former fall from an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
as it were, on a part of the earth where there is a deficiency of the quantity of
air; as is ſhewn by the ſinking of the barometer: whereas the latter are puſhed or
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0811300400:319"/>
ſqueezed forward by an addition to the atmoſphere behind them, as appears by the riſing
of the barometer.</p>

                        <p>A column of heated air becomes lighter than before, and will therefore aſcend, by the
preſſure of the cold air which ſurrounds it, like a cork in water, or like heated ſmoke in
a chimney.</p>
                        <p>Now as the ſun paſſes twice over the equator for once over either tropic, the equator
has not time to become cool; and on this account it is in general hotter at the line than
at the tropics; and therefore the air over the line, except in ſome few inſtances hereafter
to be mentioned, continues to aſcend at all ſeaſons of the year, preſſed upwards by regions
of air brought from the tropics.</p>
                        <p>This air thus brought from the tropics to the equator, would conſtitute a north wind
on one ſide of the equator, and a ſouth wind on the other; but as the ſurface of the earth
at the equator moves quicker than the ſurface of the earth at the tropics, it is evident that
a region of air brought from either tropic to the equator, and which had previouſly only
acquired the velocity of the earth's ſurface at the tropics, will now move too flow for the
earth's ſurface at the equator, and will thence appear to move in a direction contrary to
the motion of the earth. Hence the trade-winds, though they conſiſt of regions of air
brought from the north on one ſide of the line, and from the ſouth on the other, will
appear to have the diagonal direction of north-eaſt and ſouth-weſt winds.</p>
                        <p>Now it is commonly believed that there are ſuperior currents of air paſſing over theſe
north-eaſt and ſouth-weſt currents in a contrary direction, and which deſcending near
the tropics produce vertical whirlpools of air. An important queſtion here again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
itſelf, <hi>What becomes of the moiſture which this heated air ought to depoſit, as it cools
in the upper regions of the atmoſphere in its journey to the tropics?</hi> It has been ſhewn by
Dr. Prieſtley and Mr. Ingenhouz that the green matter at the bottom of ciſterns, and the
freſh leaves of plants immerſed in water, give out conſiderable quantities of vital air in
the ſun-ſhine; that is, the perſpirable matter of plants (which is water much divided in
its egreſs from their minute pores) becomes decompoſed by the ſun's light, and converted
into two kinds of air, the vital and inflammable airs. The moiſture contained or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
in the aſcending heated air at the line muſt exiſt in great tenuity; and by being
expoſed to the great light of the ſun in that climate, the water may be decompoſed, and
the new airs ſpread on the atmoſphere from the line to the poles.</p>
                        <p>1. From there being no conſtant depoſition of rains in the uſual courſe of the trade-winds,
it would appear that the water riſing at the line is decompoſed in its aſcent.</p>
                        <p>2. From the obſervations of M. Bougner on the mountain Pinchinca, one of the
Cordelieres immediately under the line, there appears to be no condenſible vapour above
three or four miles high. Now though the atmoſphere at that height may be cold to a
very conſiderable degree; yet its total deprivation of condenſible vapour would ſeem to
ſhew, that its water was decompoſed; as there are no experiments to evince that any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of cold hitherto known has been able to deprive air of its moiſture; and great
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0811300400:320"/>
abundance of ſnow is depoſited from the air that flows to the polar regions, though it is
expoſed to no greater degrees of cold in its journey thither than probably exiſts at four
miles height in the atmoſphere at the line.</p>
                        <p>3. The hygrometer of Mr. Sauſſure alſo pointed to dryneſs as he aſcended into rarer
air; the ſingle hair of which it was conſtructed, contracting from deficiency of moiſture.
Eſſais ſur l'Hygromet. p. 143.</p>
                        <p>From theſe obſervations it appears either that rare and cold air requires more moiſture
to ſaturate it than denſe air; or that the moiſture becomes decompoſed and converted
into air, as it aſcends into there cold and rare regions of the atmoſphere.</p>
                        <p>4. There ſeems ſome analogy between the circumſtance of air being produced or
generated in the cold parts of the atmoſphere both at the line and at the poles.</p>

                        <head>MONSOONS AND TORNADOES.</head>
                        <p>1. In the Arabian and Indian ſeas are winds, which blow fix months one way, and
ſix months the other, and are called Monſoons; by the accidental diſpoſitions of land
and ſea it happens, that in ſome places the air near the tropic is ſuppoſed to become
warmer when the ſun is vertical over it, than at the line. The air in theſe places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
aſcends preſſed upon one ſide by the north-eaſt regions of air, and on the other
ſide by the ſouth-weſt regions of air. For as the air brought from the ſouth has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly
obtained the velocity of the earth's ſurface at the line, it moves faſter than the
earth's ſurface near the tropic where it now arrives, and becomes a ſouth-weſt wind,
while the air from the north becomes a north-eaſt wind as before explained. Theſe two
winds do not ſo quietly join and aſcend as the north-eaſt and ſouth-eaſt winds, which
meet at the line with equal warmth and velocity and form the trade-winds; but as they
meet in contrary directions before they aſcend, and cannot be ſuppoſed accurately to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
each other, a rotatory motion will be produced as they aſcend like water falling
through a hole, and an horizontal or ſpiral eddy is the conſequence; theſe eddies are more
or leſs rapid, and are called Tornadoes in their moſt violent ſtate, raiſing water from the
ocean in the weſt or ſand from the deſerts of the eaſt, in leſs violent degrees they only
mix together the two currents of north-eaſt and ſouth-weſt air, and produce by this
means inceſſant rains, as the air of the north-eaſt acquires ſome of the heat from the
ſouth-weſt wind, as explained in Note XXV. This circumſtance of the eddies produced
by the monſoon-winds was ſeen by Mr. Bruce in Abyſſinia; he relates that for many
ſucceſſive mornings at the commencement of the rainy monſoon, he obſerved a cloud
of apparently ſmall dimenſions whirling round with great rapidity, and in a few minutes
the heavens became covered with dark clouds with conſequent great rains. See Note on
Canto III. l. 125.</p>
                        <p>2. But it is not only at the place where the air aſcends at the northern extremity of
the rainy monſoon, and where it forms tornadoes, as obſerved above by Mr. Bruce, but
over a great tract of country ſeveral degrees in length in certain parts as in the Arabian
ſea, a perpetual rain for ſeveral months deſcends, ſimilar to what happens for weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in our own climate in a leſs degree during the ſouth-weſt winds. Another important
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0811300400:321"/>
queſtion preſents itſelf here, <hi>If the climate to which this ſouth-weſt wind arrives,
is not colder than that it comes from, why ſhould it depoſit its moiſture during its whole
journey? if it be a colder climate, why does it come thither?</hi> The tornadoes of air
above deſcribed can extend but a little way, and it is not eaſy to conceive that a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
cold current of air can mix with an inferior one, and thus produce ſhowers over
ten degrees of country, ſince at about three miles high there is perpetual froſt; and what
can induce theſe narrow and ſhallow currents to flow over each other ſo many hundred
miles?</p>
                        <p>Though the earth at the northren extremity of this monſoon may be more heated by
certain circumſtances of ſituation than at the line, yet it ſeems probable that the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
country between that and the line, may continue colder than the line (as in other
parts of the earth) and hence that the air coming from the line to ſupply this aſcent or
deſtruction of air at the northern extremity of the monſoon will be cooled all the way in
its approach, and in conſequence depoſit its water. It ſeems probable that at the northern
extremity of this monſoon, where the tornadoes or hurricanes exiſt, that the air not only
aſcends but is in part converted into water, or otherwiſe diminiſhed in quantity, as no
account is given of the exiſtence of any ſuperior currents of it.</p>
                        <p>As the ſouth-weſt winds are always attended with a light atmoſphere, an incipient
vacancy, or a great diminution of air muſt have taken place to the northward of them in
all parts of the earth wherever they exiſt, and a depoſition of their moiſture ſucceeds
their being cooled by the climate they arrive at, and not by a contrary current of cold air
over them, ſince in that caſe the barometer would not ſink. They may thus in our own
country be termed monſoons without very regular periods.</p>
                        <p>3. Another cauſe of TORNADOES independent of the monſoons is ingeniouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
by Dr. Franklin; when in the tropical countries a ſtratum of inferior air becomes
ſo heated by its contact with the warm earth, that its expanſion is increaſed more
than is equivalent to the preſſure of the ſtratum of air over it; or when the ſuperior
ſtratum becomes more condenſed by cold than the inferior one by preſſure, the upper
region will deſcend and the lower one aſcend. In this ſituation if one part of the atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere
be hotter from ſome fortuitous circumſtances, or, has leſs preſſure over it, the
lower ſtratum will begin to aſcend at this part, and reſemble water falling through a hole
as mentioned above. If the lower region of air was going forwards with conſiderable
velocity, it will gain an eddy by riſing up this hole in the incumbent heavy air, ſo that
the whirlpool or tornado has not only its progreſſive velocity, but its circular one alſo,
which thus lifts up or overturns every thing within its ſpiral whirl. By the weaker
whirlwinds in this country the trees are ſometimes thrown down in a line of only twenty
or forty yards in breadth, making a kind of avenue through a country. In the Weſt
Indies the ſea riſes like a cone in the whirl, and is met by black clouds produced by the
cold upper air and the warm lower air being rapidly mixed; whence are produced the
great and ſudden rains called water-ſpouts; while the upper and lower airs exchange
their plus or minus electricity in perpetual lightenings.</p>

                        <p>The ſea being a tranſparent maſs is leſs heated at its ſurface by the ſun's rays than
the land, and its continual change of ſurface contributes to preſerve a greater uniformity
in the heat of the air which hangs over it. Hence the ſurface of the tropical iſlands is
more heated during the day than the ſea that ſurrounds them, and cools more in the
night by its greater elevation: whence in the afternoon when the lands of the tropical
iſlands have been much heated by the ſun, the air over them aſcends preſſed upwards by
the cooler air of the incircling ocean, in the morning again the land becoming cooled
more than the ſea, the air over it deſcends by its increaſed gravity, and blows over the
ocean near its ſhores.</p>

                        <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
                        <p>1. There are various irregular winds beſides thoſe above deſcribed, which conſiſt of
horizontal or vertical eddies of air owing to the inequality of the earth's ſurface, or the
juxtapoſition of the ſea. Other irregular winds have their origin from increaſed evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of water, or its ſudden devaporation and deſcent in ſhowers; others from the partial
expanſion and condenſation of air by heat and cold; by the accumulation or defect of
electric fluid, or to the air's new production or abſorption occaſioned by local cauſes
not yet diſcovered. See Notes VII. and XXV.</p>
                        <p>2. There ſeem to exiſt only two original winds: one conſiſting of air brought from
the north, and the other of air brought from the ſouth. The former of theſe winds has
alſo generally an apparent direction from the eaſt, and the latter from the weſt, ariſing
from the different velocities of the earth's ſurface. All the other winds above deſcribed
are deflections or retrogreſſions of ſome parts of theſe currents of air from the north or
ſouth.</p>
                        <p>3. One fifteenth part of the atmoſphere is occaſionally deſtroyed, and occaſionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produced
by unknown cauſes. Theſe cauſes are brought into immediate activity over a
great part of the ſurface of the earth at nearly the ſame time, but always act more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the northward than to the ſouthward of any given place; and would hence ſeem
to have their principal effect in the polar circles, exiſting nevertheleſs though with leſs
power toward the tropics or at the line.</p>
                        <p>For when the north-eaſt wind blows the barometer riſes, ſometimes from 28 ½ inches
to 30 ½, which ſhews a great new generation of air in the north; and when the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt
wind blows the barometer ſinks as much, which ſhews a great deſtruction of air in
the north. But as the north-eaſt winds ſometimes continue for five or ſix weeks, the
newly-generated air muſt be deſtroyed at thoſe times in the warmer climates to the ſouth
of us, or circulate in ſuperior currents, which has been ſhewn to be improbable from its
not depoſiting its water. And as the ſouth-weſt winds ſometimes continue for ſome
weeks, there muſt be a generation of air to the ſouth at thoſe times, or ſuperior currents,
which laſt has been ſhewn to be improbable.</p>
                        <p>4. The north-eaſt winds being generated about the poles are puſhed forwards towards
the tropics or line, by the preſſure from behind, and hence they become warmer, as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0811300400:323"/>
explained in Note VII. as well as by their coming into contact with a warmer part of
the earth which contributes to make theſe winds greedily abſorb moiſture in their paſſage.
On the contrary, the ſouth-weſt winds, as the atmoſphere is ſuddenly diminiſhed in the
polar regions, are drawn as it were into an incipient vacancy, and become therefore
expanded in their paſſage, and thus generate cold, as explained in Note VII. and are
thus induced to part with their moiſture, as well as by their contact with a colder
part of the earth's ſurface. Add to this, that the difference in the ſound of the north-eaſt
and ſouth-weſt winds may depend on the former being puſhed forwards by a preſſure
behind, and the latter falling as it were into a partial or incipient vacancy before;
whence the former becomes more condenſed, and the latter more rarefied as it paſſes.
There is a whiſtle, termed a lark-call, which conſiſts of a hollow cylinder of tin-plate,
cloſed at each end, about half an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch high, with
oppoſite holes about the ſize of a gooſe-quill through the centre of each end; if this lark-whiſtle
be held between the lips the ſound of it is manifeſtly different when the breath
is forceably blown through it from within outwards, and when it is ſucked from
without inwards. Perhaps this might be worthy the attention of organ-builders.</p>
                        <p>5. A ſtop is put to this new generation of air, when about a fifteenth of the whole is
produced, by its increaſing preſſure; and a ſimilar boundary is fixed to its abſorption or
deſtruction by the decreaſe of atmoſpheric preſſure. As water requires more heat to
convert it into vapour under a heavy atmoſphere than under a light one, ſo in letting off
the water from muddy fiſh-ponds great quantities of air-bubbles are ſeen to aſcend from
the bottom, which were previouſly confined there by the preſſure of the water. Similar
bubbles of inflammable air are ſeen to ariſe from lakes in many ſeaſons of the year,
when the atmoſphere ſuddenly becomes light.</p>
                        <p>6. The increaſed abſorptions and evolutions of air muſt, like its ſimple expanſions,
depend much on the preſence or abſence of heat and light, and will hence, in reſpect
to the times and places of its production and deſtruction, be governed by the approach
or retroceſſion of the ſun, and on the temperature, in regard to heat, of various latitudes,
and parts of the ſame latitude, ſo well explained by Mr. Kirwan.</p>
                        <p>7. Though the immediate cauſe of the deſtruction or reproduction of great maſſes
of air at certain times, when the wind changes from north to ſouth, or from ſouth to
north can not yet be aſcertained; yet as there appears greater difficulty in accounting for
this change of wind for any other known cauſes, we may ſtill ſuſpect that there exiſts in
the arctic and antarctic circles a BEAR or DRAGON yet unknown to philoſophers, which
at times ſuddenly drinks up, and as ſuddenly at other times vomits out one-fifteenth
part of the atmoſphere: and hope that this or ſome future age will learn how to govern
and domeſticate a monſter which might be rendered of ſuch important ſervice to mankind.</p>

1. To mark the hour when the wind changes from north-eaſt to ſouth-weſt, and the
contrary. This might be managed by making a communication from the vane of a
weathercock to a clock; in ſuch a manner, that if the vane ſhould revolve quite round,
a tooth on its revolving axis ſhould ſtop the clock, or put back a ſmall bolt on the edge
of a wheel revolving once in twenty-four hours.</p>
                        <p>2. To diſcover whether in a year more air paſſed from north to ſouth, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
This might be effected by placing a windmill-ſail of copper about nine inches
diameter in a hollow cylinder about ſix inches long, open at both ends, and fixed on an
eminent ſituation exactly north and ſouth. Thence only a part of the north-eaſt and
ſouth-weſt currents would affect the ſail ſo as to turn it; and if its revolutions were
counted by an adapted machinery, as the ſail would turn one way with the north
currents of air, and the contrary one with the ſouth currents, the advance of the
counting finger either way would ſhew which wind had prevailed moſt at the end of
the year.</p>

days north-eaſt with froſt, changed to ſouth-eaſt with an inceſſant though moderate
fall of ſnow. A part of the northern air, which had paſſed by us I ſuppoſe, now
became retrograde before it had acquired the velocity of the earth's ſurface to the ſouth
of us, and being attended by ſome of the ſouthern air in its journey, the moiſture of the
latter became condenſed and frozen by its mixture mith the former.</p>

                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 2, 3. The wind changed to north-weſt and thawed the ſnow. A part of the
ſouthern air, which had paſſed by us or over us, with the retrograde northern air above
deſcribed, was now in its turn driven back, before it had loſt the velocity of the ſurface
of the earth to the ſouth of us, and conſequently became a north-weſt wind; and not
having loſt the warmth it brought from the ſouth produced a thaw.</p>

                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 4, 5. Wind changed to north-eaſt with froſt and a riſing barometer. The air
from the north continuing to blow, after it had driven back the ſouthern air as above
deſcribed, became a north-eaſt wind, having leſs velocity than the ſurface of the earth in
this climate, and produced froſt from its coldneſs.</p>

                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 6, 7. Wind now changed to the ſouth-weſt with inceſſant rain and a ſinking
barometer. From unknown cauſes I ſuppoſe the quantity of air to be diminiſhed in the
polar regions, and the ſouthern air cooled by the earth's ſurface, which was previouſly
frozen, depoſits its moiſture for a day or two; afterwards the wind continued ſouth-weſt
without rain, as the ſurface of the earth became warmer.</p>

                           <hi>March</hi> 18, 1785. There has been a long froſt; a few days ago the barometer ſunk
to 29 ½, and the froſt became more ſevere. Becauſe the air being expanded by a part of
the preſſure being taken off became colder. This day the mercury roſe to 30, and the
froſt ceaſed, the wind continuing as before between north and eaſt. <hi>March</hi> 19. Mercury
above 30, weather ſtill milder, no froſt, wind north-eaſt. <hi>March</hi> 20. The ſame, for
the mercury riſing ſhews that the air becomes more compreſſed by the weight above<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <hi>April</hi> 4, 5. Froſt, wind north-eaſt, the wind changed in the middle of the day to the
north-weſt without rain, and has done ſo for three or four days, becoming again north-eaſt
at night. For the ſun now giving greater degrees of heat, the air aſcends as the
ſun paſſes the zenith, and is ſupplied below by the air on the weſtern ſide as well as on
the eaſtern ſide of the zenith during the hot part of the day; whence for a few hours, on
the approach of the hot part of the day, the air acquires a weſterly direction in this
longitude. If the north-weſt wind had been cauſed by a retrograde motion of ſome
ſouthern air, which had paſſed over us, it would have been attended with rain or clouds.</p>

                           <hi>April</hi> 10. It rained all day yeſterday, the wind north-weſt, this morning there was a
ſharp froſt. The evaporation of the moiſture, (which fell yeſterday) occaſioned by the
continuance of the wind, produced ſo much cold as to freeze the dew.</p>

                           <hi>May</hi> 12. Frequent ſhowers with a current of colder wind preceding every ſhower.
The ſinking of the rain or cloud preſſed away the air from beneath it in its deſcent,
which having been for a time ſhaded from the ſun by the floating cloud, became cooled
in ſome degree.</p>

                           <hi>June</hi> 20. The barometer ſunk, the wind became ſouth-weſt, and the whole heaven
was inſtantly covered with clouds. A part of the incumbent atmoſphere having
vaniſhed, as appeared by the ſinking of the barometer, the remainder became expanded
by its elaſticity, and thence attracted ſome of the matter of heat from the vapour inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
with it, and thus in a few minutes a total devaporation took place, as in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting
the receiver of an air-pump. See note XXV. At the place where the air is
deſtroyed, currents both from the north and ſouth flow in to ſupply the deficiency, (for
it has been ſhewn that there are no other proper winds but theſe two) and the mixture
of theſe winds produces ſo ſudden condenſation of the moiſture, both by the coldneſs of
the northern air and the expanſion of both of them, that lightning is given out, and an
incipient tornado takes place; whence thunder is ſaid frequently to approach againſt the
wind.</p>

                           <hi>Auguſt</hi> 28, 1732. Barometer was at 31, and <hi>Dec.</hi> 30, in the ſame year, it was at
28 2-tenths. Medical Eſſays, Edinburgh, Vol. II. p. 7. It appears from theſe journals
that the mercury at Edinburgh varies ſometimes nearly three inches, or one tenth of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0811300400:327"/>
the whole atmoſphere. From the journals kept by the Royal Society at London it
appears ſeldom to vary more than two inches, or one-fifteenth of the whole atmoſphere.
The quantity of the variation is ſaid ſtill to decreaſe nearer the line, and to increaſe in
the more northern latitudes; which much confirms the idea that there exiſts at certain
times a great deſtruction or production of air within the polar circle.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>July</hi> 2, 1732. The weſterly winds in the journal in the Medical Eſſays, Vol. II.
above referred to, are frequently marked with the number three to ſhew their greater
velocity, whereas the eaſterly winds ſeldom approach to the number two. The greater
velocity of the weſterly winds than the eaſterly ones is well known I believe in every
climate of the world; which may be thus explained from the theory above delivered.
1. When the air is ſtill, the higher parts of the atmoſphere move quicker than thoſe
parts which touch the earth, becauſe they are at a greater diſtance from the axis of
motion. 2. The part of the atmoſphere where the north or ſouth wind comes from
is higher than the part of it where it comes to, hence the more elevated parts of the
atmoſphere continue to deſcend towards the earth as either of thoſe winds approach.
3. When ſouthern air is brought to us it poſſeſſes a weſterly direction alſo, owing to
the velocity it had previouſly acquired from the earth's ſurface; and if it conſiſts of air
from the higher parts of the atmoſphere deſcending nearer the earth, this weſterly
velocity becomes increaſed. But when northern air is brought to us, it poſſeſſes an
apparent eaſterly direction alſo, owing to the velocity which it had previouſly acquired
from the earth's ſurface being leſs than that of the earth's ſurface in this latitude; now if
the north-eaſt wind conſiſts of air deſcending from higher parts of the atmoſphere, this
deficiency of velocity will be leſs, in conſequence of the ſame cauſe, viz. The higher
parts of the atmoſphere deſcending, as the wind approaches, increaſes the real velocity of
the weſtern winds, and decreaſes the apparent velocity of the eaſtern ones.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>October</hi> 22. Wind changed from ſouth-eaſt to ſouth-weſt. There is a popular prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication
that if the wind changes from the north towards the ſouth paſſing through
the eaſt, it is more likely to continue in the ſouth, than if it paſſes through the weſt,
which may be thus accounted for. If the north-eaſt wind changes to a north-weſt
wind, it ſhews either that a part of the northern air deſcends upon us in a ſpiral eddy,
or that a ſuperior current of ſouthern air is driven back; but if a north-eaſt wind be
changed into a ſouth-eaſt wind it ſhews that the northern air is become retrograde, and
that in a day or two, as ſoon as that part of it has paſſed, which has not gained the
velocity of the earth's ſurface in this latitude, it will become a ſouth wind for a few
hours, and then a ſouth-weſt wind.</p>

                     <p>WHEN points or hairs are put into ſpring-water, as in the experiments of Sir B.
Thompſon, (Philoſ. Tranſ. Vol. LXXVII.) and expoſed to the light of the ſun, much
air, which looſely adhered to the water, riſes in bubbles, as explained in note on Fucus,
Vol. II. A ſtill greater quantity of air, and of a purer kind, is emitted by Dr. Prieſtley's
green matter, and by vegetable leaves growing in water in the ſun-ſhine, according to
Mr. Ingenhouze's experiments; both which I ſuſpect to be owing to a decompoſition of
the water perſpired by the plant, for the edge of a capillary tube of great tenuity may be
conſidered as a circle of points, and as the oxygene, or principle of vital air, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded
into a gas by the ſun's light; the hydrogene or inflammable air may be detained
in the pores of the vegetable.</p>
                     <p>Hence plants growing in the ſhade are white, and become green by being expoſed to
the ſun's light; for their natural colour being blue, the addition of hydrogene adds
yellow to this blue, and <hi>tans</hi> them green. I ſuppoſe a ſimilar circumſtance takes place
in animal bodies; their perſpirable matter as it eſcapes in the ſun-ſhine becomes decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the edges of their pores as in vegetables, though in leſs quantity, as their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
is leſs, and by the hydrogene being retained the ſkin becomes <hi>tanned</hi> yellow.
In proof of this it muſt be obſerved that both vegetable and animal ſubſtances become
bleached white by the ſun-beams when they are dead, as cabbage-ſtalks, bones, ivory,
tallow, bees-wax, linen and cotton cloth; and hence I ſuppoſe the copper-coloured
natives of ſunny countries might become etiolated or blanched by being kept from their
infancy in the dark, or removed for a few generations to more northerly climates.</p>
                     <p>It is probable that on a ſunny morning much pure air becomes ſeparated from the
dew by means of the points of vegetables on which it adheres, and much inflammable
air imbibed by the vegetable, or combined with it; and by the ſun's light thus decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
water the effects of it in bleaching linen ſeems to depend (as deſcribed in
Note X.): the water is decompoſed by the light at the ends or points of the cotton or
thread, and the vital air unites with the phlogiſtic or colouring matters of the cloth,
and produces a new acid, which is either itſelf colourleſs or waſhes out, at the ſame
time the inflammable part of the water eſcapes. Hence there ſeems a reaſon why cotton
bleaches ſo much ſooner than linen, viz. becauſe its fibres are three or four times
ſhorter, and therefore protrude ſo many more points, which ſeem to facilitate the
liberation of the vital air from the inflammable part of the water.</p>
                     <p>Bee's wax becomes bleached by expoſure to the ſun and dews in a ſimilar manner as
metals become calcined or ruſty, viz. by the water on their ſurface being decompoſed;
and hence the inflammable material which cauſed the colour becomes united with vital
air forming a new acid, and is waſhed away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0811300400:329"/>
Oil cloſe ſtopped in a phial not full, and expoſed long to the ſun's light, becomes
bleached, as I ſuppoſe, by the decompoſition of the water it contains; the inflammable
air riſing above the ſurface, and the vital air uniting with the colouring matter of the oil.
For it is remarkable, that by ſhutting up a phial of bleached oil in a dark drawer, it in a
little time becomes coloured again.</p>
                     <p>The following experiment ſhews the power of light in ſeparating vital air from
another baſis, viz. from azote. Mr. Scheel inverted a glaſs veſſel filled with colourleſs
nitrous acid into another glaſs containing the ſame acid, and on expoſing them to the
ſun's light, the inverted glaſs became partly filled with pure air, and the acid at the ſame
time became coloured. Scheel in Crell's Annal. 1786. But if the veſſel of colourleſs
nitrous acid be quite full and ſtopped, ſo that no ſpace is left for the air produced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand
itſelf into, no change of colour takes place. Prieſtley's Exp. VI. p. 344. See Keir's
very excellent Chemical Dictionary, p. 99. new edition.</p>
                     <p>A ſun-flower three feet and half high according to the experiment of Dr. Hales, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
two pints in one day (Vegetable Statics.) which is many times as much in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to its ſurface, as is perſpired from the ſurface and lungs of animal bodies; it
follows that the vital air liberated from the ſurfaces of plants by the ſunſhine muſt much
exceed the quantity of it abſorbed by their reſpiration, and that hence they improve the air
in which they live during the light part of the day, and thus blanched vegetables will
ſooner become <hi>tanned into green</hi> by the ſun's light, than etiolated animal bodies will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>tanned yellow</hi> by the ſame means.</p>
                     <p>It is hence evident, that the curious diſcovery of Dr. Prieſtley, that his green vegetable
matter and other aquatic plants gave out vital air when the ſun ſhone upon them, and
the leaves of other plants did the ſame when immerſed in water, as obſerved by Mr.
Ingenhouze, refer to the perſpiration of vegetables not to their reſpiration. Becauſe Dr.
Prieſtley obſerved the pure air to come from both ſides of the leaves and even from the
ſtalks of a water-flag, whereas one ſide of the leaf only ſerves the of the office of lungs, and
certainly not the ſtalks. Exper. on Air, Vol. III. And thus in reſpect to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in which plants and animals ſeemed the furthereſt removed from each other, I
mean in their ſuppoſed mode of reſpiration, by which one was believed to purify the air
which the other had injured, they ſeem to differ only in degree, and the analogy between
them remains unbroken.</p>
                     <p>Plants are ſaid by many writers to grow much faſter in the night than in the day; as
is particularly obſervable in ſeedlings at their riſing out of the ground. This probably
is a conſequence of their ſleep rather than of the abſence of light; and in this I ſuppoſe
they alſo reſemble animal bodies.</p>

                     <p>AS buds are the viviparous offspring of vegetables, it becomes neceſſary that
they ſhould be furniſhed with placental veſſels for their nouriſhment, till they acquire
lungs or leaves for the purpoſe of elaborating the common juices of the earth into nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Theſe veſſels exiſt in bulbs and in ſeeds, and ſupply the young plant with a
ſweet juice till it acquires leaves, as is ſeen in converting barley into malt, and appears
from the ſweet taſte of onions and potatoes, when they begin to grow.</p>
                     <p>The placental veſſels belonging to the buds of trees are placed about the roots of
moſt, as the vine; ſo many roots are furniſhed with ſweet or mealy matter as fern-root,
bryony, carrot, turnip, potatoe, or in the alburnum or ſap-wood as in thoſe trees which
produce manna, which is depoſited about the month of Auguſt, or in the joints of ſugar
cane, and graſſes; early in the ſpring the abſorbent mouths of theſe veſſels drink up
moiſture from the earth, with a ſaccharine matter lodged for that purpoſe during the
preceding autumn, and puſh this nutritive fluid up the veſſels of the alburnum to every
individual bud, as is evinced by the experiments of Dr. Hales, and of Mr. Walker in the
Edinburgh Philoſophical Tranſact. The former obſerved that the ſap from the ſtump
of a vine, which he had cut off in the beginning of April, aroſe twenty-one feet high in
tubes affixed to it for that purpoſe, but in a few weeks it ceaſed to bleed at all, and Dr.
Walker marked the progreſs of the aſcending ſap, and found likewiſe that as ſoon as
the leaves became expanded the ſap ceaſed to riſe; the aſcending juice of ſome trees is ſo
copious and ſo ſweet during the ſap-ſeaſon that it is uſed to make wine, as the birch,
betula, and ſycamore, acer pſeudo-platinus, and particularly the palm.</p>
                     <p>During this aſcent of the ſap-juice each individual leaf-bud expands its new leaves, and
ſhoots down new roots, covering by their intertexture the old bark with a new one;
and as ſoon as theſe new roots (or bark) are capable of abſorbing ſufficient juices from
the earth for the ſupport of each bud, and the new leaves are capable of performing their
office of expoſing theſe juices to the influence of the air; the placental veſſels ceaſe
to act, coaleſce, and are tranſformed from ſap-wood, or alburnum, into inert wood;
ſerving only for the ſupport of the new tree, which grows over them.</p>
                     <p>Thus from the pith of the new bud of the horſe-cheſnut five veſſels paſs out through
the circle of the placental veſſels above deſcribed, and carry with them a minuter circle
of thoſe veſſels; theſe five bundles of veſſels unite after their exit, and form the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalk
or petiole of the new five-fingered leaf, to be ſpoken of hereafter. This ſtructure
is well ſeen by cutting off a leaf of the horſe-cheſnut (Aeſculus Hippocaſtanum) in
September before it falls, as the buds of this tree are ſo large that the flower may be ſeen
in them with the naked eye.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0811300400:331"/>
After a time, perhaps about midſummer, another bundle of veſſels paſſes from the
pith through the alburnum or ſap-veſſels in the boſom of each leaf, and unites by the
new bark with the leaf, which becomes either a flower-bud or a leaf-bud to be expanded
in the enſuing ſpring, for which purpoſe an apparatus of placental veſſels are produced
with proper nutriment during the progreſs of the ſummer and autumn, and thus
the vegetable becomes annually increaſed, ten thouſand buds often exiſting on one tree,
according to the eſtimate of Linneus. Phil. Bot.</p>
                     <p>The vaſcular connection of vegetable buds with the leaves in whoſe boſoms they are
formed is confirmed by the following experiment, (<hi>Oct.</hi> 20, 1781.) On the extremity
of a young bud of the Mimoſa (ſenſitive plant) a ſmall drop of acid of vitriol was put by
means of a pen, and, after a few ſeconds, the leaf in whoſe axilla it dwelt cloſed and
opened no more, though the drop of vitriolic acid was ſo ſmall as apparently only to
injure the ſummit of the bud. Does not this ſeem to ſhew that the leaf and its bud
have connecting veſſels though they ariſe at different times and from different parts of
the medulla or pith? And, as it exiſts previouſly to it, that the leaf is the parent of
the bud?</p>
                     <p>This placentation of vegetable buds is clearly evinced from the ſweetneſs of the
riſing ſap, and from its ceaſing to riſe as ſoon as the leaves are expanded, and thus
compleats the analogy between buds and bulbs. Nor need we wonder at the length
of the umbilical cords of buds ſince that muſt correſpond with their ſituation on
the tree, in the ſame manner as their lymphatics and arteries are proportionally
elongated.</p>
                     <p>It does not appear probable that any umbilical artery attends theſe placental ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbents,
ſince, as there ſeems to be no ſyſtem of veins in vegetables to bring back
the blood from the extremities of their arteries, (except their pulmonary veins,) there
could not be any vegetable fluids to be returned to their placenta, which in vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables
ſeems to be ſimply an organ for nutrition, whereas the placenta of the animal
foetus ſeems likewiſe to ſerve as a reſpiratory organ like the gills of fiſhes.</p>

leaves upon it, and wiping the two wounded ends dry he quickly applied to each a
cement, previouſly warmed a little, which conſiſted principally of pitch, and planted them
in the earth. The uſe of this cement I ſuppoſe to conſiſt in its preventing the bud from
bleeding to death, though the author aſcribes it to its antiſceptic quality.</p>
                     <p>Theſe buds of plants, which are thus each an individual vegetable, in many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
reſemble individual animals, but as animal bodies are detached from the earth,
and move from place to place in ſearch of food, and take that food at conſiderable
intervals of time, and prepare it for their nouriſhment within their own bodies after
it is taken, it is evident they muſt require many organs and powers which are not
neceſſary to a ſtationary bud. As vegetables are immoveably fixed to the ſoil from
whence they draw their mouriſhment ready prepared, and this uniformly not at returning
intervals, it follows that in examining their anatome we are not to look for muſcles of
locomotion, as arms and legs; nor for organs to receive and prepare their nouriſhment,
as a ſtomach and bowels; nor for a reſervoir for it after it is prepared, as a general ſyſtem
of veins, which in locomotive animals contains and returns the ſuperfluous blood
which is left after the various organs of ſecretion have been ſupplied, by which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
they are enabled to live a long time without new ſupplies of food.</p>
                     <p>The parts which we may expect to find in the anatome of vegetables correſpondent
to thoſe in the animal economy are, 1. A ſyſtem of abſorbent veſſels to imbibe the
moiſture of the earth ſimilar to the lacteal veſſels, as in the roots of plants; and another
ſyſtem of abſorbents ſimilar to the lymphatics of animal bodies, opening its mouths
on the internal cells and external ſurfaces of vegetables; and a third ſyſtem of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbent
veſſels correſpondent with thoſe of the placentation of the animal foetus. 2. A
pulmonary ſyſtem correſpondent to the lungs or gills of quadrupeds and fiſh, by
which the fluid abſorbed by the lacteals and lymphatics may be expoſed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of the air, this is done by the green leaves of plants, thoſe in the air re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
lungs, and thoſe in the water reſembling gills; and by the petals of flowers.
3. Arterial ſyſtems to convey the fluid thus elaborated to the various glands of the
vegetable for the purpoſes of its growth, nutrition, and various ſecretions. 4. The
various glands which ſeparate from the vegetable blood the honey, wax, gum, reſin,
ſtarch, ſugar, eſſential oil, &amp;c. 5. The organs adapted for their propagation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>production.
6. Muſcles to perform ſeveral motions of their parts.</p>

                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0811300400:333"/>
I. The exiſtence of that branch of the abſorbent veſſels of vegetables which reſembles
the lacteals of animal bodies, and imbibes their nutriment from the moiſt earth, is
evinced by their growth ſo long as moiſture is applied to their roots, and their quickly
withering when it is withdrawn.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe abſorbents in the roots of plants there are others which open their
mouths on the external ſurfaces of the bark and leaves, and on the internal ſurfaces of
all the cells, and between the bark and the alburnum or ſap-wood; the exiſtence of
theſe is ſhewn, becauſe a leaf plucked off and laid with its under ſide on water will not
wither ſo ſoon as if left in the dry air,—the ſame if the bark alone of a branch which
is ſeparated from a tree be kept moiſt with water,—and laſtly, by moiſtening the
alburnum or ſap-wood alone of a branch detached from a tree it will not ſo ſoon wither
as if left in the dry air. By the following experiment theſe veſſels were agreeably viſible
by a common magnifying glaſs, I placed in the ſummer of 1781 the footſtalks of ſome
large fig-leaves about an inch deep in a decoction of madder, (rubia tinctorum,) and
others in a decoction of logwood, (haematoxylum campechenſe,) along with ſome ſprigs
cut off from a plant of picris, theſe plants were choſen becauſe their blood is white,
after ſome hours, and on the next day, on taking out either of theſe and cutting off
from its bottom about a quarter of an inch of the ſtalk an internal circle of red points
appeared, which were the ends of abſorbent veſſels coloured red with the decoction,
while an external ring of arteries was ſeen to bleed out haſtily a milky juice, and at once
evinced both the abſorbent and arterial ſyſtem. Theſe abſorbent veſſels have been called
by Grew, and Malphigi, and ſome other philoſophers, bronchi, and erroneouſly ſuppoſed
to be air-veſſels. It is probable that theſe veſſels, when cut through, may effuſe their
fluids, and receive air, their ſides being too ſtiff to collapſe; ſince dry wood emits air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bubles
in the exhauſted receiver in the ſame manner as moiſt wood.</p>
                     <p>The ſtructure of theſe vegetable abſorbents conſiſts of a ſpiral line, and not of a veſſel
interrupted with valves like the animal lymphatics, ſince on breaking almoſt any tender
leaf and drawing out ſome of the fibres which adhere longeſt this ſpiral ſtructure
becomes viſible even to the naked eye, and diſtinctly ſo by the uſe of a common lens.
See Grew, Plate 51.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch a ſtructure it is eaſy to conceive how a vermicular or periſtaltic motion of
the veſſel beginning at the loweſt part of it, each ſpiral ring ſucceſſively contracting itſelf
till it fills up the tube, muſt forcibly puſh forwards its contents, as from the roots of
vines in the bleeding ſeaſon; and if this vermicular motion ſhould begin at the upper
end of the veſſel it is as eaſy to ſee how it muſt carry its contained fluid in a contrary
direction. The retrograde motion of the vegetable abſorbent veſſels is ſhewn by cutting
a forked branch from a tree, and immerſing a part of one of the forks in water, which
will for many days prevent the other from withering; or it is ſhewn by planting a
willow branch with the wrong end upwards. This ſtructure in ſome degree obtains in
the eſophagus or throat of cows, who by ſimilar means convey their food firſt downwards
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0811300400:334"/>
and afterward upwards by a retrograde motion of the annular muſcles or cartilages for
the purpoſe of a ſecond maſtication of it.</p>
                     <p>II. The fluids thus drank up by the vegetable abſorbent veſſels from the earth, or
from the atmoſphere, or from their own cells and interſtices, are carried to the foot-ſtalk
of every leaf, where the abſorbents belonging to each leaf unite into branches, forming
ſo many pulmonary arteries, and are thence diſperſed to the extremities of the leaf, as
may be ſeen in cutting away ſlice after ſlice the footſtalk of a horſe-cheſnut in September
before the leaf falls. There is then a compleat circulation in the leaf, a pulmonary vein
receiving the blood from the extremities of each artery on the upper ſide of the leaf,
and joining again in the footſtalk of the leaf theſe veins produce ſo many arteries, or
aortas, which diſperſe the new blood over the new bark, elongating its veſſels, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
its ſecretions; but as a reſervoir of blood could not be wanted by a vegetable bud
which takes in its nutriment at all times, I imagine there is no venous ſyſtem, no veins
properly ſo called, which receive the blood which was to ſpare, and return it into the
pulmonary or arterial ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>The want of a ſyſtem of veins was countenanced by the following experiment; I cut
off ſeveral ſtems of tall ſpurge, (Euphorbia helioſcopia) in autumn, about the centre of
the plant, and obſerved tenfold the quantity of milky juice ooze from the upper than
from the lower extremity, which could hardly have happened if there had been a venous
ſyſtem of veſſels to return the blood from the roots to the leaves.</p>
                     <p>Thus the vegetable circulation, complete in the lungs, but probably in the other
part of the ſyſtem deficient in reſpect to a ſyſtem of returning veins, is carried forwards
without a heart, like the circulation through the livers of animals where the blood
brought from the inteſtines and meſentery by one vein is diſperſed through the liver by
the vena portarum, which aſſumes the office of an artery. See Note XXXVII.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time ſo minute are the veſſels in the intertexture of the barks of plants,
which belong to each individual bud, that a general circulation may poſſibly exiſt,
though we have not yet been able to diſcover the venous part of it.</p>
                     <p>There is however another part of the circulation of vegetable juices viſible to the
naked eye, and that is in the corol or petals of flowers, in which a part of the blood of
the plant is expoſed to the influence of the air and light in the ſame manner as in the
foliage, as will be mentioned more at large in Notes XXXVII and XXXIX.</p>
                     <p>Theſe circulations of their reſpective fluids ſeem to be carried on in the veſſels of
plants preciſely as in animal bodies by their irritability to the ſtimulus of their adapted
fluids, and not by any mechanical or chemical attraction, for their abſorbent veſſels
propel the juice upwards, which they drink up from the earth, with great violence; I
ſuppoſe with much greater than is exerted by the lacteals of animals, probably owing to
the greater minuteneſs of theſe veſſels in vegetables and the greater rigidity of their coats.
Dr. Hales in the ſpring ſeaſon cut off a vine near the ground, and by fixing tubes on the
remaining ſtump of it, found the ſap to riſe twenty-one feet in the tube by the propulſive
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0811300400:335"/>
power of theſe abſorbents of the roots of it. Veget. Stat. p. 102. Such a power can not
be produced by capillary attraction, as that could only raiſe a fluid nearly to the upper
edge of the attracting cylinder, but not enable it to flow over that edge, and much leſs
to riſe 21 feet above it. What then can this power be owing to? Doubtleſs to the living
activity of the abſorbent veſſels, and to their increaſed vivacity from the influence of the
warmth of the ſpring ſucceeding the winter's cold, and their thence greater ſuſceptibility
to irritation from the juices which they abſorb, reſembling in all circumſtances the
action of the living veſſels of animals.</p>

                     <p>I. THERE have been various opinions concerning the uſe of the leaves of plants
in the vegetable oeconomy. Some have contended that they are perſpiratory organs;
this does not ſeem probable from an experiment of Dr. Hales, Veg. Stat. p. 30. He
found by cutting off branches of trees with apples on them, and taking off the leaves, that
an apple exhaled about as much as two leaves, the ſurfaces of which were nearly equal
to the apple; whence it would appear that apples have as good a claim to be termed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratory
organs as leaves. Others have believed them excretory organs of excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
juices; but as the vapour exhaled from vegetables has no taſte, this idea is no more
probable than the other; add to this that in moiſt weather, they do not appear to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
or exhale at all.</p>
                     <p>The internal ſurface of the lungs or air-veſſels in men, are ſaid to be equal to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſurface of the whole body, or about fifteen ſquare feet; on this ſurface the blood
is expoſed to the influence of the reſpired air through the medium however of a thin pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licle;
by this expoſure to the air it has its colour changed from deep red to bright ſcarlet,
and acquires ſomething ſo neceſſary to the exiſtence of life, that we can live ſcarcely a
minute without this wonderful proceſs.</p>
                     <p>The analogy between the leaves of plants and the lungs or gills of animals ſeems to
embrace ſo many circumſtances, that we can ſcarcely withhold our aſſent to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
ſimilar offices.</p>
                     <p>1. The great ſurface of the leaves compared to that of the trunk and branches of trees
is ſuch, that it would ſeem to be an organ well adapted for the purpoſe of expoſing the
vegetable juices to the influence of the air; this however we ſhall ſee afterwards is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
performed only by their upper ſurfaces, yet even in this caſe the ſurface of the
leaves in general bear a greater proportion to the ſurface of the tree, than the lungs of
animals to their external ſurfaces.</p>

                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0811300400:336"/>
2. In the lungs of animal, the blood after having been expoſed to the air in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
of pulmonary artery, is changed in colour from deep red to bright ſcarlet, and
certainly in ſome of its eſſential properties; it is then collected by the pulmonary vein
and returned to the heart. To ſhew a ſimilarity of circumſtance in the leaves of plants
the following experiment was made, June 24, 1781: A ſtalk with leaves and ſeed-veſſels
of large ſpurge (Euphorbia helioſcopia) had been ſeveral days placed in a decoction
of madder (Rubia tinctorum) ſo that the lower part of the ſtem, and two of the undermoſt
leaves were immerſed in it. After having waſhed the immerſed leaves in clear water, I
could readily diſcern the colour of the madder paſſing along the middle rib of each leaf.
This red artery was beautifully viſible both on the under and upper ſurface of the leaf;
but on the upper ſide many red branches were ſeen going from it to the extremities of
the leaf, which on the other ſide were not viſible except by looking through it againſt
the light. On this under ſide a ſyſtem of branching veſſels carrying a pale milky fluid
were ſeen coming from the extremities of the leaf, and covering the whole underſide of
it, and joining into two large veins, one on each ſide of the red artery in the middle rib
of the leaf, and along with it deſcending to the footſtalk or petiole. On ſlitting one of
theſe leaves with ſciſſars, and having a common magnifying lens ready, the milky blood
was ſeen oozing out of the returning veins on each ſide of the red artery in the middle
rib, but none of the red fluid from the artery.</p>
                     <p>All theſe appearances were more eaſily ſeen in a leaf of Picris treated in the ſame
manner; for in this milky plant the ſtems and middle rib of the leaves are ſometimes
naturally coloured reddiſh, and hence the colour of the madder ſeemed to paſs further
into the ramifications of their leaf-arteries, and was there beautifully viſible with the
returning branches of milky veins on each ſide.</p>
                     <p>3. From theſe experiments the upper ſurface of the leaf appeared to be the immediate
organ of reſpiration, becauſe the coloured fluid was carried to the extremities of the leaf
by veſſels moſt conſpicuous on the upper ſurface, and there changed into a milky fluid,
which is the blood of the plant, and then returned by concomitant veins on the under
ſurface, which were ſeen to ooze when divided with ſciſſars, and which in Picris, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
render the under ſurface of the leaves greatly whiter than the upper one.</p>
                     <p>4. As the upper ſurface of leaves conſtitutes the organ of reſpiration, on which the
ſap is expoſed in the terminations of arteries beneath a thin pellicle to the action of the
atmoſphere, theſe ſurfaces in many plants ſtrongly repel moiſture, as cabbage-leaves,
whence the particles of rain lying over their ſurfaces without touching them, as obſerved
by Mr. Melville (Eſſays Literary and Philoſop. Edinburgh) have the appearance of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules
of quickſilver. And hence leaves laid with the upper ſurfaces on water, wither as
ſoon as in the dry air, but continue green many days, if placed with the under ſurfaces
on water, as appears in the experiments of Mons. Bonnet (Uſage des Fevilles.) Hence
ſome aquatic plants, as the Water-lily (Nymphoea) have the lower ſides of their leaves
floating on the water, while the upper ſurfaces remain dry in the air.</p>
                     <p>5. As thoſe inſects, which have many ſpiracula, or breathing apertures, as waſps
and flies, are immediately ſuffocated by pouring oil upon them, I carefully covered with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0811300400:337"/>
oil the ſurfaces of ſeveral leaves of Phlomis, of Portugal Laurel, and Balſams, and though
it would not regularly adhere, I found them all die in a day or two.</p>
                     <p>Of aquatic leaves, ſee Note on Trapa and on Fucus, in Vol. II. to which muſt be added
that many leaves are furniſhed with muſcles about their footſtalks, to turn their upper
ſurfaces to the air or light, as Mimoſa and Hedyſarum gyrans. From all theſe analogies
I think there can be no doubt but that leaves of trees are their lungs, giving out a phlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtic
material to the atmoſphere, and abſorbing oxygene or vital air.</p>
                     <p>6. The great uſe of light to vegetation would appear from this theory to be by diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
vital air from the water which they perſpire, and thence to facilitate its union
with their blood expoſed beneath the thin ſurface of their leaves; ſince when pure air is
thus applied, it is probable, that it can be more readily abſorbed. Hence in the curious
experiments of Dr. Prieſtley and Mr. Ingenhouze, ſome plants purified air leſs than
others, that is, they perſpired leſs in the ſunſhine; and Mr. Scheele found that by putting
peas into water, which about half-covered them, that they converted the vital air into
fixed air, or carbonic acid gas, in the ſame manner as in animal reſpiration. See Note
XXXIV.</p>
                     <p>7. The circulation in the lungs or leaves of plants is very ſimilar to that of fiſh. In
fiſh the blood after having paſſed through their gills does not return to the heart as from
the lungs of air-breathing animals, but the pulmonary vein taking the ſtructure of an
artery after having received the blood from the gills, which there gains a more florrid
colour, diſtributes it to the other parts of their bodies. The ſame ſtructure occurs in the
livers of fiſh, whence we ſee in thoſe animals two circulations independent of the power
of the heart, viz. that beginning at the termination of the veins of the gills, and branching
through the muſcles; and that which paſſes through the liver; both which are carried
on by the action of thoſe reſpective arteries and veins. Monro's Phyſiology of Fiſh, p. 19.</p>
                     <p>The courſe of the fluids in the roots, leaves, and buds of vegetables ſeems to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in a manner ſimilar to both theſe. Firſt the abſorbent veſſels of the roots and
ſurfaces unite at the footſtalk of the leaf; and then, like the Vena Portarum, an artery
commences without the intervention of a heart, and ſpreads the ſap in its numerous rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
on the upper ſurface of the leaf; here it changes its colour and properties, and
becomes vegetable blood; and is again collected by a pulmonary vein on the under ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the leaf. This vein, like that which receives the blood from the gills of fiſh,
aſſumes the office and name of an artery, and branching again diſperſes the blood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the bud from the footſtalk of the leaf, and downward to the roots; where it is
all expended in the various ſecretions, the nouriſhment and growth of the plant, as faſt as
it is prepared.</p>
                     <p>II. The organ of reſpiration already ſpoken of belongs particularly to the ſhoots or
buds, but there is another pulmonary ſyſtem, perhaps totally independent of the green
foliage, which belongs to the fructification only, I mean the corol or petals. In this
there is an artery belonging to each petal, which conveys the vegetable blood to its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,
expoſing it to the light and air under a delicate membrane covering the internal
ſurface of the petal, where it often changes its colour, as is beautifully ſeen in ſome party-coloured
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0811300400:338"/>
poppies; though it is probable ſome of the irideſcent colours of flowers may be
owing to the different degrees of tenuity of the exterior membrane of the leaf refracting
the light like ſoap-bubbles, the vegetable blood is then returned by correſpondent vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
veins, exactly as in the green foliage; for the purpoſes of the important ſecretions
of honey, wax, the finer eſſential oil, and the prolific duſt of the anthers.</p>
                     <p>1. The vaſcular ſtructure of the corol as above deſcribed, and which is viſible to the
naked eye, and its expoſing the vegetable juices to the air and light during the day,
evinces that it is a pulmonary organ.</p>
                     <p>2. As the glands which produce the prolific duſt of the anthers, the honey, wax, and
frequently ſome odoriferous eſſential oil, are generally attached to the corol, and always
fall off and periſh with it, it is evident that the blood is elaborated or oxygenated in this
pulmonary ſyſtem for the purpoſe of theſe important ſecretions.</p>
                     <p>3. Many flowers, as the Colchicum, and Hamamelis ariſe naked in autumn, no green
leaves appearing till the enſuing ſpring; and many others put forth their flowers and
complete their impregnation early in the ſpring before the green foliage appears, as
Mezereon, cherries, pears, which ſhews that theſe corols are the lungs belonging to the
fructification.</p>
                     <p>4. This organ does not ſeem to have been neceſſary for the defence of the ſtamens
and piſtils, ſince the calyx of many flowers, as Tragopogon, performs this office; and in
many flowers theſe petals themſelves are ſo tender as to require being ſhut up in the calyx
during the night, for what other uſe then can ſuch an apparatus of veſſels be deſigned?</p>
                     <p>5. In the Helleborus-niger, Chriſtmas-roſe, after the ſeeds are grown to a certain ſize,
the nectaries and ſtamens drop off, and the beautiful large white petals change their
colour to a deep green, and gradually thus become as calyx incloſing and defending the
ripening ſeeds, hence it would ſeem that the white veſſels of the corol ſerved the office of
expoſing the blood to the action of the air, for the purpoſes of ſeparating or producing
the honey, wax, and prolific duſt, and when theſe were no longer wanted, that theſe
veſſels coaleſced like the placental veſſels of animals after their birth, and thus ceaſed to
perform that office and loſt at the ſame time their white colour. Why ſhould they looſe
their white colour, unleſs they at the ſame time loſt ſome other property beſides that of
defending the ſeed-veſſel, which they ſtill continue to defend?</p>
                     <p>6. From theſe obſervations I am led to doubt whether green leaves be abſolutely
neceſſary to the progreſs of the fruit-bud after the laſt year's leaves are fallen off. The
green leaves ſerve as lungs to the ſhoots and foſter the new buds in their boſoms,
whether theſe buds be leaf-buds or fruit-buds; but in the early ſpring the fruit-buds
expand their corols, which are their lungs, and ſeem no longer to require green leaves;
hence the vine bears fruit at one joint without leaves, and puts out a leaf-bud at another
joint without fruit. And I ſuppoſe the green leaves which riſe out of the earth in the
ſpring from the Colchicum are for the purpoſe of producing the new bulb, and its pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa,
and not for the giving maturity to the ſeed. When currant or gooſberry trees
loſe their leaves by the depredation of inſects the fruit continues to be formed, though
leſs ſweet and leſs in ſize.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0811300400:339"/>
7. From theſe facts it appears that the flower-bud after the corol falls off, (which is its
lungs,) and the ſtamens and nectary along with it, becomes ſimply an uterus for the
purpoſe of ſupplying the growing embryon with nouriſhment, together with a ſyſtem
of abſorbent veſſels which bring the juices of the earth to the footſtalk of the fruit,
and which there changes into an artery for the purpoſe of diſtributing the ſap for the
ſecretion of the ſaccharine or farinaceous or aceſcent materials for the uſe of the
embryon. At the ſame time as all the veſſels of the different buds of trees inoſculate
or communicate with each other, the fruit becomes ſweeter and larger when the green
leaves continue on the tree, but the mature flowers themſelves, (the ſucceeding fruit
not conſidered) perhaps ſuffer little injury from the green leaves being taken off, as
ſome floriſts have obſerved.</p>
                     <p>8. That the veſſels of different vegetable buds inoſculate in various parts of their
circulation is rendered probable by the increaſed growth of one bud, when others in
its vicinity are cut away; as it thus ſeems to receive the nouriſhment which was before
divided amongſt many.</p>

at leaſt twenty days before the flower is in full bloom, that is twenty days before fecunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
At this time alſo the powder of the anthers was viſible, but glued faſt to their ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.
The ſeeds however at this time, and for ten days after the bloſſom had fallen off,
appeared to conſiſt of a gelatinous ſubſtance. On the eleventh day after the falling of the
bloſſom the ſeeds became heart-ſhape, with the baſis attached by an appendage to the pod,
and a white point at the apex; this white point was on preſſure found to be a cavity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
a drop of liquor.</p>
                     <p>On the 25th day the cavity which at firſt appeared at the apex was much enlarged and
ſtill full of liquor, it alſo contained a very ſmall ſemi-tranſparent body, of a yellowiſh
colour, gelatinous, and fixed by its two oppoſite ends to the ſides of the cavity.</p>
                     <p>In a month the ſeed was much enlarged and its ſhape changed from a heart to a
kidney, the little body contained in the cavity was increaſed in bulk and was leſs
tranſparent, and gelatinous, but there yet appeared no organization.</p>

                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0811300400:340"/>
On the 40th day the cavity now grown larger was quite filled with the body, which
was covered with a thin membrane; after this membrane was removed the body appeared
of a bright green, and was eaſily divided by the point of a needle into two portions,
which manifeſtly formed the two lobes, and within theſe attached to the lower part the
exceedingly ſmall plantule was eaſily perceived.</p>
                     <p>The foregoing obſervations evince, 1. That the ſeeds exiſt in the ovarium many
days before fecundation. 2. That they remain for ſome time ſolid, and then a cavity
containing a liquid is formed in them. 3. That after fecundation a body begins to
appear within the cavity fixed by two points to the ſides, which in proceſs of time proves
to be two lobes containing a plantule. 4. That the ripe ſeed conſiſts of two lobes
adhering to a plantule, and ſurrounded by a thin membrane which is itſelf covered with
a huſk or cuticle. Spalanzani's Diſſertations, Vol. II. p. 253.</p>
                     <p>The analogy between ſeeds and eggs has long been obſerved, and is confirmed by the
mode of their production. The egg is known to be formed within the hen long before
its impregnation; C. F. Wolf aſſerts that the yolk or the egg is nouriſhed by the veſſels
of the mother, and that it has from thoſe its arterial and venous branches, but that after
impregnation theſe veſſels gradually become impervious and obliterated, and that new
ones are produced from the fetus and diſperſed into the yolk. Haller's Phyſiolog.
Tom. VIII. p. 94. The young ſeed after fecundation, I ſuppoſe, is nouriſhed in a
ſimilar manner from the gelatinous liquor, which is previouſly depoſited for that purpoſe;
the uterus of the plant producing or ſecreting it into a reſervoir or amnios in which the
embryon is lodged, and that the young embryon is furniſhed with veſſels to abſorb a
part of it, as in the very early embryon in the animal uterus.</p>
                     <p>The ſpawn of frogs and of fiſh is delivered from the female before its impregnation.
M. Bonnet ſays that the male ſalamander darts his ſemen into the water, where it
forms a little whitiſh cloud which is afterwards received by the ſwoln anus of the
female, and ſhe is fecundated.—He adds that marine plants approach near to theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
as the male does not project a fine powder but a liquor which in like manner forms
a little cloud in the water.—And further adds, who knows but the powder of the ſtamina
of certain plants may not make ſome impreſſion on certain germs belonging to the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
kingdom! Letter XLIII. to Spalanzani, Oevres Philoſ.</p>
                     <p>Spalanzani found that the ſeminal fluid of frogs and dogs even when diluted with
much water retained its prolific quality. Whether this quality be ſimply a ſtimulus
exciting the egg into animal action, which may be called a vivifying principle, or whether
part of it be actually conjoined with the egg is not yet determined, though the latter
ſeems more probable from the frequent reſemblance of the fetus to the male parent. A
conjunction however of both the male and female influence ſeems neceſſary for the
purpoſe of reproduction throughout all organized nature, as well in hermaphrodite
inſects, microſcopic animals, and polypi, and exiſts as well in the formation of the
buds of vegetables as in the production of their ſeeds, which is ingeniouſly conceived
and explained by Linneus. After having compared the flower to the larva of a butterfly,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0811300400:341"/>
conſiſting of petals inſtead of wings, calyxes inſtead of wing-ſheaths, with the organs of
reproduction, and having ſhewn the uſe of the farina in fecundating the egg or ſeed,
he proceeds to explain the production of the bud. The calyx of a flower, he ſays, is
an expanſion of the outer bark, the petals proceed from the inner bark or rind, the
ſtamens from the alburnum or woody circle, and the ſtyle from the pith. In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
and impregnation of the ſeed a commixture of the ſecretions of the ſtamens and
ſtyle are neceſſary; and for the production of a bud he thinks the medulla or pith burſts
its integuments and mixes with the woody part or alburnum, and theſe forcing their
paſſage through the rind and bark conſtitute the bud or viviparous progeny of the
vegetable. Syſtem of Vegetables tranſlated from Linneus, p. 8.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſuppoſed that the embryon vegetable after fecundation, by its living
activity or ſtimulus exerted on the veſſels of the parent plant, may produce the fruit or
ſeed-lobes, as the animal fetus produces its placenta, and as vegetable buds may be
ſuppoſed to produce their umbilical veſſels or roots down the bark of the tree. This in
reſpect to the production of the fruit ſurrounding the ſeeds of trees has been aſſimilated
to the gall-nuts on oak-leaves, and to the bedeguar on briars, but there is a powerful
objection to this doctrine, viz. that the fruit of figs, all which are female in this country,
grow nearly as large without fecundation, and therefore the embryon has in them no
ſelf-living principle.</p>

                     <p>THE glands of vegetables which ſeparate from their blood the mucilage, ſtarch, or
ſugar for the placentation or ſupport of their ſeeds, bulbs, and buds; or thoſe which
depoſit their bitter, acrid, or narcotic juices for their defence from depredations of
infects or larger animals; or thoſe which ſecrete reſins or wax for their protection from
moiſture or froſts, conſiſt of veſſels too fine for the injection or abſorption of coloured
fluids, and have not therefore yet been exhibited to the inſpection even of our glaſſes,
and can therefore only be known by their effects, but one of the moſt curious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
of all vegetable ſecretions, that of honey, is apparent to our naked eyes, though
before the diſcoveries of Linneus the nectary or honey-gland had not even acquired a
name.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0811300400:342"/>
The odoriferous eſſential oils of ſeveral flowers ſeem to have been deſigned for their
defence againſt the depredations of inſects, while their beautiful colours were a neceſſary
conſequence of the ſize of the particles of their blood, or of the tenuity of the exterior
membrane of the petal. The uſe of the prolific duſt is now well aſcertained, the wax
which covers the anthers prevents this duſt from receiving moiſture, which would make
it burſt prematurely and thence prevent its application to the ſtigma, as ſometimes
happens in moiſt years and is the cauſe of deficient fecundation both of our fields and
orchards.</p>
                     <p>The univerſality of the production of honey in the vegetable world, and the very
complicated apparatus which nature has conſtructed in many flowers, as well as the
acrid or deleterious juices ſhe has furniſhed thoſe flowers with (as in the Aconite) to
protect this honey from rain and from the depredations of inſects, ſeem to imply that
this fluid is of very great importance in the vegetable economy; and alſo that it was
neceſſary to expoſe it to the open air previous to its reabſorption into the vegetable
veſſels.</p>
                     <p>In the animal ſyſtem the lachrymal gland ſeparates its fluid into the open air for the
purpoſe of moiſtening the eye, of this fluid the part which does not exhale is abſorbed
by the puncta lachrymalia and carried into the noſtrils; but as this is not a nutritive
fluid the analogy goes no further than its ſecretion into the open air and its reabſorption
into the ſyſtem; every other ſecreted fluid in the animal body is in part abſorbed again
into the ſyſtem, even thoſe which are eſteemed excrementitious, as the urine and
perſpirable matter, of which the latter is ſecreted, like the honey, into the external air.
That the honey is a nutritious fluid, perhaps the moſt ſo of any vegetable production,
appears from its great ſimilarity to ſugar, and from its affording ſuſtenance to ſuch
numbers of inſects, which live upon it ſolely during ſummer, and lay it up for their
winter proviſion. Theſe proofs of its nutritive nature evince the neceſſity of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abſorption
into the vegetable ſyſtem for ſome uſeful purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>This purpoſe however has as yet eſcaped the reſearches of philoſophical botaniſts.
M. Pontedera believes it deſigned to lubricate the vegetable uterus, and compares the
horn-like nectaries of ſome flowers to the appendicle of the caecum inteſtinum of animals.
Antholog. p. 49.) Others have ſuppoſed that the honey, when reabſorbed, might
ſerve the purpoſe of the liquor amnii, or white of the egg, as a nutriment for the young
embryon or fecundated ſeed in its early ſtate of exiſtence. But as the nectary is found
equally general in male flowers as in female ones; and as the young embryon or ſeed
grows before the petals and nectary are expanded, and after they fall off; and, thirdly,
as the nectary ſo ſoon falls off after the fecundation of the piſtillum; theſe ſeem to be
inſurmountable objections to both the above-mentioned opinions.</p>
                     <p>In this ſtate of uncertainty conjectures may be of uſe ſo far as they lead to further
experiment and inveſtigation. In many tribes of inſects, as the ſilk-worm, and perhaps
in all the moths and butterflies, the male and female parents die as ſoon as the eggs are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0811300400:343"/>
impregnated and excluded; the eggs remaining to be perfected and hatched at ſome
future time. The ſame thing happens in regard to the male and female parts of flowers;
the anthers and filaments, which conſtitute the male parts of the flower, and the ſtigma
and ſtyle, which conſtitute the female part of the flower, fall off and die as ſoon as the
ſeeds are impregnated, and along with theſe the petals and nectary. Now the moths and
butterflies above-mentioned, as ſoon as they acquire the paſſion and the apparatus for
the reproduction of their ſpecies, looſe the power of feeding upon leaves as they did
before, and become nouriſhed by what?—by honey alone.</p>
                     <p>Hence we acquire a ſtrong analogy for the uſe of the nectary or ſecretion of honey
in the vegetable economy, which is, that the male parts of flowers, and the female parts,
as ſoon as they leave their fetus-ſtate, expanding their petals, (which conſtitute their
lungs,) become ſenſible to the paſſion, and gain the apparatus for the reproduction of
their ſpecies, and are fed and nouriſhed with honey like the inſects above deſcribed;
and that hence the nectary begins its office of producing honey, and dies or ceaſes to
produce honey at the ſame time with the birth and death of the ſtamens and the piſtils;
which, whether exiſting in the ſame or in different flowers, are ſeparate and diſtinct
animated beings.</p>
                     <p>Previous to this time the anthers with their filaments, and the ſtigmas with their
ſtyles, are in their fetus-ſtate ſuſtained by their placental veſſels, like the unexpanded
leaf-bud; with the ſeeds exiſting in the vegetable womb yet unimpregnated, and the
duſt yet unripe in the cells of the anthers. After this period they expand their petals,
which have been ſhewn above to conſtitute the lungs of the flower; the placental
veſſels, which before nouriſhed the anthers and the ſtigmas, coaleſce or ceaſe to nouriſh
them; and they now acquire blood more oxygenated by the air, obtain the paſſion and
power of reproduction, are ſenſible to heat, and cold, and moiſture, and to mechanic
ſtimulus, and become in reality inſects fed with honey, ſimilar in every reſpect except
their being attached to the tree on which they were produced.</p>
                     <p>Some experiments I have made this ſummer by cutting out the nectaries of ſeveral
flowers of the aconites before the petals were open, or had become much coloured, ſome
of theſe flowers near the ſummit of the plants produced no ſeeds, others lower down
produced ſeeds; but they were not ſufficiently guarded from the farina of the flowers in
their vicinity; nor have I had opportunity to try if theſe ſeeds would vegetate.</p>
                     <p>I am acquainted with a philoſopher, who contemplating this ſubject thinks it not
impoſſible, that the firſt inſects were the anthers or ſtigmas of flowers; which had-by
ſome means looſed themſelves from their parent plant, like the male flowers of Valliſneria;
and that many other inſects have gradually in long proceſs of time been formed
from theſe; ſome acquiring wings, others fins, and others claws, from their ceaſeleſs
efforts to procure their food, or to ſecure themſelves from injury. He contends, that
none of theſe changes are more incomprehenſible than the tranſformation of tadpoles
into frogs, and caterpillars into butterflies.</p>
                     <p>There are parts of animal bodies, which do not require oxygenated blood for the
purpoſe of their ſecretions, as the liver; which for the production of bile takes its blood
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0811300400:344"/>
from the meſenteric veins, after it muſt have loſt the whole or a great part of its oxyge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which it had acquired in its paſſage through the lungs. In like manner the
pericarpium, or womb of the flower, continues to ſecrete its proper juices for the preſent
nouriſhment of the newly animated embryon-ſeed; and the ſaccharine, aceſcent, or
ſtarchy matter of the fruit or ſeed-lobes for its future growth; in the ſame manner as
theſe things went on before fecundation; that is, without any circulation of juices in the
petals, or production of honey in the nectary; theſe having periſhed and fallen off with
the male and female apparatus for impregnation.</p>
                     <p>It is probable that the depredations of inſects on this nutritious fluid muſt be injurious
to the products of vegetation, and would be much more ſo, but that the plants have
either acquired means to defend their honey in part, or have learned to make more than
is abſolutely neceſſary for their own economy. In the ſame manner the honey-dew on
trees is very injurions to them; in which diſeaſe the nutritive fluid, the vegetable-ſap-juice,
ſeems to be exſuded by a retrograde motion of the cutaneous lymphatics, as in
the ſweating ſickneſs of the laſt century. To prevent the depredation of inſects on honey
a wealthy man in Italy is ſaid to have poiſoned his neighbour's bees perhaps by mixing
arſnic with honey, againſt which there is a moſt flowery declamation in Quintilian.
No. XIII. As the uſe of the wax is to preſerve the duſt of the anthers from moiſture,
which would prematurely burſt them, the bees which collect this for the conſtruction of
the combs or cells, muſt on this account alſo injure the vegetation of a country where
they too much abound.</p>
                     <p>It is not eaſy to conjecture why it was neceſſary that this ſecretion of honey ſhould be
expoſed to the open air in the nectary or honey-cup, for which purpoſe of great an
apparatus for its defence from inſects and from ſhowers became neceſſary. This diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
increaſes when we recollect that the ſugar in the joints of graſs, in the ſugar-cane,
and in the roots of beets, and in ripe fruits is produced without the expoſure to the
air. On ſuppoſition of its ſerving for nutriment to the anthers and ſtigmas it may thus
acquire greater oxygenation for the purpoſe of producing greater powers of ſenſibility, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a doctrine lately advanced by a French philoſopher, who has endeavoured to
ſhew that the oxygene, or baſe of vital air, is the conſtituent principle of our power of
ſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>From this proviſion of honey for the male and female parts of flowers, and from
the proviſion of ſugar, ſtarch, oil, and mucilage, in the fruits, ſeed-cotyledons, roots, and
buds of plants laid up for the nutriment of the expanding fetus, not only a very
numerous claſs of inſects, but a great part of the larger animals procure their food; and
thus enjoy life and pleaſure without producing pain to others, for theſe ſeeds or eggs
with the nutriment laid up in them are not yet endued with ſenſitive life.</p>
                     <p>The ſecretions from various vegetable glands hardened in the air produce gums,
reſins, and various kinds of ſaccharine, ſaponaceous, and wax-like ſubſtances, as the
gum of cherry or plumb-trees, gum tragacanth from the aſtragalus tragacantha, camphor
from the laurus camphora, elemi from amyris elemifera, aneme from hymenoea courbaril,
turpentine from piſtacia terebinthus, balſam of Mecca from the buds of amyris opobal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamum,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0811300400:345"/>
branches of which are placed in the temples of the Eaſt on account of their
fragrance, the wood is called xylobalſamum, and the fruit carpobalſamum; aloe from a
plant of the ſame name; myrrh from a plant not yet deſcribed; the remarkably elaſtic
reſin is brought into Europe principally in the form of flaſks, which look like black leather,
and are wonderfully elaſtic, and not penetrable by water, rectified ether diſſolves it; its
flexibility is encreaſed by warmth and deſtroyed by cold; the tree which yields this juice
is the jatropha elaſtica, it grows in Guaiana and the neighbouring tracts of America;
its juice is ſaid to reſemble wax in becoming ſoft by heat, but that it acquires no elaſticity
till that property is communicated to it by a ſecret art, after which it is poured into
moulds and well dried and can no longer be rendered fluid by heat. Mr. de la Borde
phyſician at Cayenne has given this account. Manna is obtained at Naples from the
fraxinus ornus, or manna-aſh, it partly iſſues ſpontaneouſly, which is preferred, and
partly exſudes from wounds made purpoſely in the month of Auguſt, many other
plants yield manna more ſparingly; ſugar is properly made from the ſaccharum officinale,
or ſugar-cane, but is found in the roots of beet and many other plants; American wax
is obtained from the myrica cerifera, candle-berry myrtle, the berries are boiled in water
and a green wax ſeparates, with luke warm water the wax is yellow: the ſeed of croton
ſebiferum are lodged in tallow; there are many other vegetable exſudations uſed in the
various arts of dyeing, varniſhing, tanning, lacquering, and which ſupply the ſhop of
the druggiſt with medicines and with poiſons.</p>
                     <p>There is another analogy, which would ſeem to aſſociate plants with animals, and
which perhaps belongs to this Note on Glandulation, I mean the ſimilarity of their
digeſtive powers. In the roots of growing vegetables, as in the proceſs of making malt,
the farinaceous part of the ſeed is converted into ſugar by the vegetable power of
digeſtion in the ſame manner as the farinaceous matter of ſeeds are converted into ſweet
chyle by the animal digeſtion. The ſap-juice which riſes in the vernal months from the
roots of trees through the alburnum or ſap-wood, owes its ſweetneſs I ſuppoſe to a
ſimilar digeſtive power of the abſorbent ſyſtem of the young buds. This exiſts in many
vegetables in great abundance as in vines, ſycamore, birch, and moſt abundantly in the
palm-tree, (Iſert's Voyage to Guinea,) and ſeems to be a ſimilar fluid in all plants, as
chyle is ſimilar in all animals.</p>
                     <p>Hence as the digeſted food of vegetables conſiſts principally of ſugar, and from that
is produced again their mucilage, ſtarch, and oil, and ſince animals are ſuſtained by
theſe vegetable productions, it would ſeem that the ſugar-making proceſs carried on in
vegetable veſſels was the great ſource of life to all organized beings. And that if our
improved chemiſtry ſhould ever diſcover the art of making ſugar from foſſile or aerial
matter without the aſſiſtance of vegetation, food for animals would then become as
plentiful as water, and mankind might live upon the earth as thick as blades of graſs,
with no reſtraint to their numbers but the want of local room.</p>
                     <p>It would ſeem that roots fixed in the earth, and leaves innumerable waving in the
air were neceſſary forthe decompoſition of water, and the converſion of it into ſaccharine
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0811300400:346"/>
matter, which would have been not only cumberous but totally incompatible with the
locomotion of animal bodies. For how could a man or quadruped have carried on his
head or back a foreſt of leaves, or have had long branching lacteal or abſorbent veſſels
terminating in the earth? Animals therefore ſubſiſt on vegetables; that is, they take
the matter ſo far prepared, and have organs to prepare it further for the purpoſes of
higher animation, and greater ſenſibility. In the ſame manner the apparatus of green
leaves and long roots were found inconvenient for the more animated and ſenſitive parts
of vegetable-flowers, I mean the anthers and ſtigmas, which are therefore ſeparate beings,
endued with the paſſion and power of reproduction, with lungs of their own, and fed with
honey, a food ready prepared by the long roots and green leaves of the plant, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to their abſorbent mouths.</p>
                     <p>From this outline a philoſopher may catch a glimpſe of the general economy of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and like the mariner caſt upon an unknown ſhore, who rejoiced when he ſaw the

                     <head>The following is an Addition to the Note on Coal, No. XXIII.</head>
                     <p>FROM this account of the production of coals from moraſſes it would appear,
that coal-beds are not to be expected beneath maſſes of lime-ſtone. Nevertheleſs I have
been lately informed by my friend Mr. Michell of Thornhill, who I hope will ſoon favour
the public with his geological inveſtigations, that the beds of chalk are the uppermoſt of
all the limeſtones; and that they reſt on the granulated limeſtone, called ketton-ſtone;
which I ſuppoſe is ſimilar to that which covers the whole country from Leadenham to
Sleaford, and from Sleaford to Lincoln; and that, thirdly, coal-delphs are frequently
found beneath theſe two uppermoſt beds of limeſtone.</p>
                     <p>Now as the beds of chalk and of granulated limeſtone may have been formed by
alluviation, on or beneath the ſhores of the ſea, or in vallies of the land; it would ſeem,
that ſome coal countries, which in the great commotions of the earth had been ſunk
beneath the water, were thus covered with alluvial limeſtone, as well as others with
alluvial baſaltes, or common gravel-beds. Very extenſive plains which now conſiſt of
alluvial materials, were in the early times covered with water; which has ſince diminiſhed,
as the ſolid parts of the earth have increaſed. For the ſolid parts of the earth conſiſting
chiefly of animal and vegetable recrements muſt have originally been formed or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the water by animal and vegetable proceſſes; and as the ſolid parts of the
earth may be ſuppoſed to be thrice as heavy as water, it follows that thrice the quantity
of water muſt have vaniſhed compared with the quantity of earth thus produced. This
may account for many immenſe beds of alluvial materials, as gravel, rounded ſand,
granulated limeſtone, and chalk, covering ſuch extenſive plains as Lincoln-heath, having
become dry without the ſuppoſition of their having been again elevated from the ocean.
At the ſame time we acquire the knowledge of one of the uſes or final cauſes of the
organized world, not indeed very flattering to our vanity, that it converts water into
earth, forming iſlands and continents by its recrements or exuviae.</p>

herb, naked and perfect like a butterfly from its chryſolis; winged with its corol;
wing-ſheathed by its calyx; conſiſting alone of the organs of reproduction. The males,
or ſtamens, have their anthers replete with a prolific powder containing the vivifying
fovilla: in the females, or piſtils, exiſts the ovary, terminated by the tubular ſtigma.
When the anthers burſt and ſhed their bags of duſt, the male fovilla is received by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lific
lymph of the ſtigma, and produces the ſeed or egg, which is nouriſhed in the ovary.

                        <hi>Wound them ye Sylphs!</hi> p. 198. 1. 463. It is cuſtomary to debark oak-trees in the
ſpring, which are intended to be felled in the enſuing autumn; becauſe the bark comes
off eaſier at this ſeaſon, and the ſap-wood, or alburnum, is believed to become harder
and more durable, if the tree remains till the end of ſummer. The trees thus ſtripped of
their bark put forth ſhoots as uſual with acorns on the 6th 7th and 8th joint, like vines;
but in the branches I examined, the joints of the debarked trees were much ſhorter than
thoſe of other oak-trees; the acorns were more numerous; and no new buds were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
above the joints which bore acorns. From hence it appears that the branches of
debarked oak-trees produce fewer leaf-buds, and more flower-buds, which laſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
I ſuppoſe muſt depend on their being ſooner or later debarked in the vernal
months. And, ſecondly, that the new buds of debarked oak-trees continue to obtain
moiſture from the alburnum after the ſeaſon of the aſcent of ſap in other vegetables
ceaſes; which in this unnatural ſtate of the debarked tree may act as capillary tubes,
like the alburnum of the ſmall debarked cylinder of a pear-tree abovementioned; or may
continue to act as placental veſſels, as happens to the animal embryon in caſes of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetation;
when the fetus continues a month or two in the womb beyond its uſual time,
of which ſome inſtances have been recorded, the placenta continues to ſupply perhaps
the double office both of nutrition and of reſpiration.</p>

formed, but it is believed by ſome of the Linnean ſchool, that theſe buds may in their
early ſtate be either converted into flower-buds or leaf-buds according to the vigour of
the vegetating branch. Thus if the upper part of a branch be cut away, the buds near
the extremity of the remaining ſtem, having a greater proportional ſupply of nutriment,
or poſſeſſing a greater facility of ſhooting their roots, or abſorbent veſſels, down the bark,
will become leaf-buds, which might otherwiſe have been flower-buds. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
as explained in note on l. 463. of this Canto.</p>

                           <p>I conceive the medulla of a plant to conſiſt of a
bundle of nervous fibres, and that the propelling vital power ſeparates their uppermoſt
extremities. Theſe, diverging, penetrate the bark, which is now gelatinous, and become
multiplied in the new gem, or leaf-bud. The aſcending veſſels of the bark being thus
divided by the nervous fibres, which perforate it, and the aſcent of its fluids being thus
impeded, the bark is extended into a leaf. But the flower is produced, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion
of the medulla is greater than the retention of the including cortical part; whence
the ſubſtance of the bark is expanded in the calyx; that of the rind, (or interior bark,)
in the corol; that of the wood in the ſtamens, that of the medulla in the piſtil. Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
thus terminates in the production of new life, the ultimate medullary and cortical
fibres being collected in the ſeeds.</p>

                        <hi>Diana's trees,</hi> p. 206. l. 552. The chemiſts and aſtronomers from the earlieſt antiquity
have uſed the ſame characters to repreſent the metals and the planets, which were moſt
probably outlines or abſtracts of the original hieroglyphic figures of Egypt. Theſe
afterwards acquired niches in their temples, and repreſented Gods as well as metals and
planets; whence ſilver is called Diana, or the moon, in the books of alchemy.</p>
                     <p>The proceſs for making Diana's ſilver tree is thus deſcribed by Lemeri. Diſſolve
one ounce of pure ſilver in acid of nitre very pure and moderately ſtrong; mix this
ſolution with about twenty ounces of diſtilled water; add to this two ounces of mercury,
and let it remain at reſt. In about four days there will form upon the mercury a tree
of ſilver with branches imitating vegetation.</p>
                     <p>1. As the mercury has a greater affinity than ſilver with the nitrous acid, the ſilver
becomes precipitated; and, being deprived of the nitrous oxygene by the mercury, ſinks
down in its metallic form and luſtre. 2. The attraction between ſilver and mercury,
which cauſes them readily to amalgamate together, occaſions the precipitated ſilver to
adhere to the ſurface of the mercury in preference to any other part of the veſſel. 3. The
attraction of the particles of the precipitated ſilver to each other cauſes the beginning
branches to thicken and elongate into trees and ſhrubs rooted on the mercury. For
other circumſtances concerning this beautiful experiment ſee Mr. Keir's Chemical
Dictionary, art. Arbor Dianae; a work perhaps of greater utility to mankind than the
loſt Alexandrian Library; the continuation of which is ſo eagerly expected by all, who
are occupied in the arts, or attached to the ſciences.</p>

                     <p>I. Solution of water in air; in the matter of heat; pulſe-glaſs. 2. Heat is the
principal cauſe of evaporation; thermometer cooled by evaporation of ether; heat given
from ſteam to the worm-tub; warmth accompanying rain. 3. Steam condenſed on the
eduction of heat; moiſture on cold walls; ſouth-weſt and north-eaſt winds. 4. Solution
of ſalt and of blue vitriol in the matter of heat. II. Other vapours may precipitate
ſteam and form rain. 1. Cold the principal cauſe of devaporation; hence the ſteam
diſſolved in heat is precipitated, but that diſſolved in air remains even in froſts; ſouth-weſt
wind. 2. North-eaſt winds mixing with ſouth-weſt winds produce rain; becauſe
the cold particles of air of the north-eaſt acquire ſome of the matter of heat from the
ſouth-weſt winds. 3. Devaporation from mechanical expanſion of air, as in the receiver
of an air-pump; ſummer-clouds appear and vaniſh; when the barometers ſink without
change of wind the weather becomes colder. 4. Solution of water in electric fluid
dubious. 5. Barometer ſinks from the leſſened gravity of the air, and from the rain
having leſs preſſure as it falls; a mixture of a ſolution of water in calorique with an
aerial ſolution of water is lighter than dry air; breath of animals in cold weather why
condenſed into viſible vapour and diſſolved again.</p>

                  <p>THE general deſign of the following ſheets is to inliſt Imagination
under the banner of Science, and to lead her votaries from the
looſer analogies, which dreſs out the imagery of poetry, to the
ſtricter ones, which form the ratiocination of philoſophy. While
their particular deſign is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the
knowledge of BOTANY; by introducing them to the veſtibule of that
delightful ſcience, and recommending to their attention the immortal
works of the Swediſh Naturaliſt LINNEUS.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Poem, or Economy of Vegetation, the phyſiology of
Plants is delivered; and the operation of the Elements, as far as they
may be ſuppoſed to affect the growth of Vegetables. But the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of this part is deferred to another year, for the purpoſe of
repeating ſome experiments on vegetation, mentioned in the notes.
In the ſecond poem, or LOVES OF THE PLANTS, which is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Reader, the Sexual Syſtem of LINNEUS is explained,
with the remarkable properties of many particular plants.</p>
                  <p>The author has withheld this work, (excepting a few pages) many
years from the preſs, according to the rule of Horace, hoping to
have rendered it more worthy the acceptance of the public,—but
finds at length, that he is leſs able, from diſuſe, to correct the
poetry; and, from want of leizure, to amplify the annotations.</p>
                  <p>In this ſecond edition, the plants Amaryllis, Orchis, and Cannabis
are inſerted with two additional prints of flowers; ſome alterations
are made in Glorioſa, and Tulipa; and the deſcription of the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
in Poland is removed to the firſt poem on the Economy of
Vegetation.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>LINNEUS has divided the vegetable world into 24 Claſſes;
theſe Claſſes into about 120 Orders; theſe Orders contain
about 2000 Families, or Genera; and theſe Families about 20,000
Species; beſides the innumerable Varieties, which the accidents of
climate or cultivation have added to theſe Species.</p>
                  <p>The Claſſes are diſtinguiſhed from each other in this ingenious
ſyſtem, by the number, ſituation, adheſion, or reciprocal proportion
of the males in each flower. The Orders, in many of theſe Claſſes,
are diſtinguiſhed by the number, or other circumſtances of the females.
The Families, or Genera, are characterized by the analogy of all the
parts of the flower or fructification. The Species are diſtinguiſhed
by the foliage of the plant; and the Varieties by any accidental cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of colour, taſte, or odour; the ſeeds of theſe do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
produce plants ſimilar to the parent; as in our numerous fruit-trees
and garden flowers; which are propagated by grafts or layers.</p>
                  <p>The firſt eleven Claſſes include the plants, in whoſe flowers both
the ſexes reſide; and in which the Males or Stamens are neither
united, nor unequal in height when at maturity; and are therefore
diſtinguiſhed from each other ſimply by the number of males in each
flower, as is ſeen in the annexed PLATE, copied from the Dictionaire
Botanique of M. BULLIARD, in which the numbers of each diviſion
refer to the Botanic Claſſes.</p>

The Orders of the firſt thirteen Claſſes are founded on the number
of Females, or Piſtils, and diſtinguiſhed by the names, ONE FEMALE,
<hi>Monogynia.</hi> Two FEMALES, <hi>Digynia.</hi> THREE FEMALES, <hi>Trigynia.
&amp;c.</hi> as is ſeen in No. 1. which repreſents a plant of one male, one
female; and in the firſt Figure of No. xi. which repreſents a flower
with twelve males, and three females; (for, where the piſtils have
no apparent ſtyles, the ſummits, or ſtigmas, are to be numbered) and
in the firſt Figure of No. xii. which repreſents a flower with twenty
males and many females; and in the laſt Figure of the ſame No.
which has twenty males and one female; and in No. xiii. which
repreſents a flower with many males and many females.</p>
                  <p>The Claſs of Two POWERS, is divided into two natural Orders;
into ſuch as have their ſeeds naked at the bottom of the calyx, or
flower cup; and ſuch as have their ſeeds covered; as is ſeen in No.
xiv. Fig. 3. and 5.</p>
                  <p>The Claſs of FOUR POWERS, is divided alſo into two Orders; in
one of theſe the ſeeds are incloſed in a ſilicule, as in <hi>Shepherd's purſe.</hi>
No. xiv. Fig. 5. In the other they are incloſed in a ſilique, as in
<hi>Wall-flower.</hi> Fig. 4.</p>
                  <p>In all the other Claſſes, excepting the Claſſes Confederate Males,
and Clandeſtine Marriage, as the character of each Claſs is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by the ſituations of the males; the character of the Orders
is marked by the numbers of them. In the Claſs ONE BROTHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOOD,
No. xvi. Fig. 3. the Order of ten males is repreſented. And
in the Claſs Two BROTHERHOODS, No. xvii. Fig. 2. the Order
ten males is repreſented.</p>
                  <p>In the Claſs CONFEDERATE MALES, the Orders are chiefly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
by the fertility or barrenneſs of the florets of the diſk, or
ray of the compound flower.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0811300400:370"/>
And in the Claſs of CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE, the four Orders
are termed FFRNS, MOSSES, FLAGS, and FUNGUSSES.</p>
                  <p>The Orders are again divided into Genera, or Families, which are
all natural aſſociations, and are deſcribed from the general reſemblances
of the parts of fructification, in reſpect to their number, form, ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and reciprocal proportion. Theſe are the Calyx, or Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cup,
as ſeen in No. iv. Fig. 1. No. x. Fig. 1. and 3. No. xiv. Fig.
1. 2. 3. 4. Second, the Corol, or Bloſſom, as ſeen in No. i. ii. &amp;c.
Third, the Males, or Stamens; as in No. iv. Fig. 1. and No. viii.
Fig. 1. Fourth, the Females, or Piſtils; as in No. i. No. xii. Fig.
1. No. xiv. Fig. 3. No. xv. Fig. 3. Fifth, the Pericarp or Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſel;
as No. xv. Fig. 4. 5. No. xvii. Fig. 2. Sixth, the Seeds.</p>
                  <p>The illuſtrious author of the Sexual Syſtem of Botany, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to his account of the Natural Orders, ingeniouſly imagines, that
one plant of each Natural Order was created in the beginning; and
that the intermarriages of theſe produced one plant of every Genus,
or Family; and that the intermarriages of theſe Generic, or Family
plants, produced all the Species: and laſtly, that the intermarriages
of the individuals of the Species produced the Varieties.</p>
                  <p>In the following POEM, the name or number of the Claſs or
Order of each plant is printed in italics; as "<hi>Two</hi> brother ſwains."
"<hi>One</hi> Houſe contains them." and the word "<hi>ſecret.</hi>" expreſſes the
Claſs of Clandeſtine Marriage.</p>

The males are generally united at the bottom in two ſets, whence Linneus has named the claſs "two brotherhoods." In the Geniſta, however, they are united in but one ſet. The flowers of this claſs are called papilionaccous, from their reſemblance to a butterfly, as the pea-bloſſom. In the Spartium Scoparium, or common broom, I have lately obſerved a curious circumſtance, the males or ſtamens are in two ſets, one ſet riſing a quarter of an inch above the other; the upper ſet does not arrive at their maturity ſo ſoon as the lower, and the ſtigma, or head of the female, is produced amongſt the upper or immature ſet; but as ſoon as the piſtil grows tall enough to burſt open the keel-leaf, or hood of the flower, it bends itſelf round in an inſtant, like a French horn, and inserts its head, or ſtigma, amongſt the lower or mature ſet of males. The piſtil, or female, continues to grow in length; and in a few days the ſtigma arrives again amongſt the upper ſet, by the time they become mature. This wonderful contrivance is readily ſeen by opening the keel-leaf of the flowers of broom before they burſt ſpontaneouſly. See note on Collinſonia, Glorioſa, Draba.</p>

In each flower there are four males and one female; two of the males ſtand higher than the other two; whence the name of the claſs "two powers." I have obſerved in the Ballota, and others of this claſs, that the two lower ſtamens, or makes become mature before the two higher. After they have ſhed their duſt, they turn themſelves away outwards; and the piſtil, or female, continuing to grow a little taller, is applied to the upper ſtamens. See Gloriſta, and Geniſta.</p>

The uncommon beauty of this flower occaſioned Linneus to give it a name ſignifying the twelve heathen gods; and Dr. Mead to affix his own name to it. The piſtil is much longer than the ſtamens, hence the flower-ſtalks have their elegant bend, that the ſtigma may hang downwards to receive the fecundating duſt of the anthers. And the petals are ſo beautifully turned back to prevent the rain or dew drops from ſliding down and waſhing off this duſt prematurely; and at the ſame time expoſing it to the light and air. As ſoon as the ſeeds are ſormed, it erects all the flower- ſtalks to prevent them from ſalling out; and thus loses the beauty of its figure. Is this a mechanical effect, or does it indicate a vegetable ſtorgé to preſerve its offspring? See note on Ilex, and Glorioſa.</p>
                           <p>In the Meadia, the Borago, Cyclamen, Solanum, and many others, the filaments are very ſhort compared with the ſtyle. Hence it became neceſſary, 1ſt, to furniſh the ſtamens with long anthers. 2d. I'o lengthen and bend the peduncle or flower-ſtalk, that the flower might hang downwards. 3d. To reflect the petals. 4th. To erect theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duncles when the germ was fecundated. We may reaſon upon this by obſerving, that all this apparatus might have been ſpared, if the filaments alone had grown longer; and that thence in theſe flowers that the filaments are the most unchangeable parts; and that thence their comparative length, in reſpect to the ſtyle, would afford a moſt permanent mark of their generic character.</p>

In like manner the florets, which form the rays of the flowers of the order fruſtraneous polygamy of the claſs ſyngeneſia, or confederate males, as the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower, are furniſhed with a ſtyle only, and no ſtigma: and are thence barren.

The flowers of this graſs give the fragrant ſcent to hay. I am informed it is frequently viviparous, that is, that it bears ſometimes roots or bulbs inſt ad of ſeeds, which after a time drop off and ſtrike root into the ground. This circumſtance is ſaid to obtain in many of the alpine graſſes, whoſe ſeeds are perpetually devoured by ſmall birds. The Feſtuca Dumetorum, ſeſcue graſs of the buſhes, produces bulbs from the ſheaths of its ſtraw. The Allium Magicum, or magical onion, produces onions on its head, inſtead of ſeeds. The Polygonum Viviparum, viviparous biſtort, riſes about a foot high, with a beautiful ſpike of flowers, which are ſucceeded by buds or bulbs, which fall off and take root. There is a buſh frequently ſeen on birch-trees, like a bird's neſt, which ſeems to be a ſimilar attempt of nature, to produce another tree; which falling off might take root in ſpongy ground.</p>

In a few days, as theſe decline, the other three ſtamens bend over, and approach the piſtil. In the Fritillaria Perſica, the ſix ſtamens are of equal lengths, and the anthers lie at a diſtance from the piſtil, and three alternate ones approach firſt; and, when theſe decline, the other three approach; in the Lithrum Salicaria, (which has twelve males and one female) a beautiful red flower, which grows on the banks of rivers, ſix of the males arrive at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, and ſurround the female ſome time before the other ſix; when theſe decline, the other ſix riſe up, and ſupply their places.

Three females and ten males inhabit each flower; the viſcous material, which ſurrounds the ſtalks under the flowers of this plant, and of the Cucubulus Otites, is a curious contrivance to prevent various inſects from plundering the honey, or devouring the ſeed. In the Dionaea Muſcipula there is a ſtill more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful contrivance to prevent the depredations of inſects: The leaves are armed with long teeth, like the antennae of inſects, and lie ſpread upon the ground round the ſtem; and are ſo irritable, that when an inſect creeps upon them, they fold up, and cruſh or pierce it to death. The laſt profeſſor Linneus, in his Supplementum Plantarum, gives the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing account of the Arum Muſcivorum. The flower has the ſmell of carrion; by which the flies are invited to lay their eggs in the chamber of the flower, but in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to eſcape, being prevented by the hairs pointing inwards; and thus periſh in the flower, whence its name of fly-eater. P. 411. in the Dypſacus is another contrivance for this purpoſe, a baſon of water is placed round each joint of the ſtem. In the Droſera is another kind of fly-trap. See Dypſacus and Droſera; the flowers of Siléne and Cucú<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus are cloſed all day, but are open and give an agreeable odour in the night. See Cerea.

                              <hi>Amaryllis.</hi> l. 152. Formoſiſſima. Moſt beautiful Amaryllis. Six males, one female. Some of the bell-flowers cloſe their apertures at night, or in rainy or cold weather, as the convolvulus, and thus protect their included ſtamens and piſtils. Other bell-flowers hang their apertures downwards, as many of the lilies; in thoſe the piſtil, when at maturity, is longer than the ſtamens; and by this pendant attitude of the bell, when the anthers burſt, their duſt falls on the ſtigma; and theſe are at the ſame time ſheltered as with an umbrella from rain and dews. But, as a free expoſure to the air is neceſſary for their fecundation, the ſtyle and filaments in many of theſe flowers continue to grow longer after the bell is open, and hang down below its rim. In others, as in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagon, the bell is deeply divided, and the diviſions are reflected upwards, that they may not prevent the acceſs of air, and at the ſame time afford ſome ſhelter from perpendicular rain or dew. Other bell-flowers, as the hemerocallis and amaryllis, have their bells nodding only, as it were, or hanging obliquely toward the horizon; which, as their ſtems are ſlender, turn like a weathercock from the wind; and thus very effectually preſerve their incloſed ſtamens and anthers from the rain and cold. Many of theſe flowers, both before and after their ſeaſon of fecundation, erect their heads perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular to the horizon, like the Meadia, which cannot be explained from meer mechaniſm.</p>
                           <p>The Amaryllis formoſiſſima is a flower of the laſt mentioned kind, and affords an agreeable example of <hi>art</hi> in the vegetable economy. 1. The piſtil is of great length compared with the ſtamens; and this I ſuppoſe to have been the moſt unchangeable part of the flower, as in Meadia, which ſee. 2. To counteract this circumſtance, the piſtil and ſtamens are made to decline downwards, that the prolific duſt might fall from the anthers on the ſtigma. 3. To produce this effect, and to ſecure it when produced, the corol is lacerated, contrary to what occurs in other flowers of this genus, and the loweſt diviſion with the two next loweſt ones are wrapped cloſely over the ſtyle and filaments, binding them forceibly down lower toward the horizon than the uſual inclination of the bell in this genus, and thus conſtitutes a moſt elegant flower.

Many plants, like many animals, are furniſhed with arms for their protection; theſe are either aculei, prickles, as in roſe and barberry, which are formed from the outer bark of the plant; or ſpinae, thorns, as in hawthorn, which are an elongation of the wood, and hence more difficult to be torn off than the former; or ſtimuli, ſtings, as in the nettles, which are armed with a venom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fluid for the annoyance of naked animals. The ſhrubs and trees, which have prickles or thorns, are grateful food to many animals, as gooſberry, and gorſe; and would be quickly devoured, if not thus armed; the ſtings ſeem a protection againſt ſome kinds of inſects, as well as the naked mouths of quadrupeds. Many plants loſe their thorns by cultivation, as wild animals loſe their ferocity; and ſome of them their horns. A curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous circumſtance attends the large hollies in Needwood-foreſt, they are armed with thorny leaves about eight feet high, and have ſmooth leaves above; as if they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that horſes and cattle could not reach their upper branches. See note on Meadia, and on Mancinella. The numerous clumps of hollies in Needwood-foreſt ſerve as land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks to direct the travellers acroſs it in various directions; and as a ſhelter to the deer and cattle in winter; and in ſcarce ſeaſons ſupply them with much food. For when the upper branches, which are without prickles, are cut down, the deer crop the leaves and peel off the bark. The bird-lime made from the bark of hollies ſeems to be a very ſimilar material to the elaſtic gum, or Indian rubber, as it is called. There is a foſſile elaſtic bitumen found at Matlock in Derbyſhire, which much reſembles theſe ſubſtances in its elaſticity and inflammability. The thorns of the mimoſa cornigere reſemble cow's horns in appearance as well as in uſe. Syſtem of Vegetables, p. 782.</p>

Other ſeeds are diſſeminated by animals; of theſe ſome attach themſelves to their hair or feathers by a gluten, as miſleto; others by hooks, as cleavers, burdock, hounds-tongue; and others are ſwallowed whole for the ſake of the fruit, and voided uninjured, as the hawthorn, juniper, and ſome graſſes. Other ſeeds again diſperſe themſelves by means of an elaſtic ſeed-veſſel, as Oats, Geranium, and Impatiens; and the ſeeds of aquatic plants, and of thoſe which grow on the banks of rivers, are carried many miles by the currents, into which they fall.

The leaves of this marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant are purple, and have a fringe very unlike other vegetable productions. And, which is curious, at the point of every thread of this erect fringe ſtands a pellucid drop of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilage, reſembling a ducal coronet. This mucus is a ſecretion from certain glands, and like the viſcous material round the flower-ſtalks of Silene (catchfly) prevents ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects from infeſting the leaves. As the ear-wax in animals ſeems to be in part deſigned to prevent fleas and other infects from getting into their ears. See Silene. Mr. Wheatly, an eminent ſurgeon in Cateaton-ſtreet, London, obſerved theſe leaves to bend upwards, when an inſect ſettled on them, like the leaves of the muſcipula veneris, and pointing all their globules of mucus to the centre, that they compleatly intangled and deſtroyed it. M. Brouſſonet, in the Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences for the year 1784. p. 615. after having deſcribed the motion of the Dionaea, adds, that a ſimilar appearance has been obſerved in the leaves of two ſpecies of Droſera.</p>

                              <hi>Lonicera.</hi> l. 243. Caprifolium. Honeyſuckle. Five males, one female. Nature has in many flowers uſed a wonderful apparatus to guard the nectary, or honey-gland, from infects. In the honey-ſuckle the petal terminates in a long tube like a cornucopiae, or horn of plenty; and the honey is produced at the bottom of it. In Aconitum, monks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the nectaries ſtand upright like two horns covered with a hood, which abounds with ſuch acrid matter that no infects penetrate it. In Helleborus, hellebore, the many nectaries are placed in a circle, like little pitchers, and add much to the beauty of the flower. In the Columbine, Aquilegia, the nectary is imagined to be like the neck and body of a bird, and the two petals ſtanding upon each ſide to repreſent wings; whence its name of columbine, as if reſembling a neſt of young pigeons fluttering whilſt their parent feeds them. The importance of the nectary in the economy of vegetation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained at large in the note on part the firſt.</p>
                           <p>Many infects are provided with a long and pliant proboſcis for the purpoſe of acquiring this grateful food, as a variety of bees, moths, and butterflies: but the Sphinx Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volvuli, or unicorn moth, is furniſhed with the moſt remarkable proboſcis in this climate. It carries it rolled up in concentric circles under its chin, and occaſionally extends it to above three inches in length. This trunk conſiſts of joints and muſcles, and ſeems to have more verſatile movements than the trunk of the elephant; and near its termination is ſplit into two capillary tubes. The excellence of this contrivance for robbing the flowers of their honey, keeps this beautiful inſect fat and bulky; though it flies only in the evening, when the flowers have cloſed their petals, and are thence more difficult of acceſs; at the ſame time the brilliant colours of the moth contribute to its ſafety, by making it miſtaken by the late ſleeping birds for the flower it reſts on.</p>
                           <p>Beſides theſe there is a curious contrivance attending the Ophrys, commonly called the Bee-orchis, and the Fly-orchis, with ſome kinds of the Delphinium, called Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larkſpurs, to preſerve their honey; in theſe the nectary and petals reſemble in form and colour the inſects, which plunder them: and thus it may be ſuppoſed, they often eſcape theſe hourly robbers, by having the appearance of being pre-occupied.

                           <p>This curious ſtem is ſometimes puſhed out of the ground in its horizontal ſituation by ſome of the inferior branches of the root, ſo as to give it ſome reſemblance to a Lamb ſtanding on four legs; and has been ſaid to deſtroy all other plants in its vicinity. Sir Hans Sloane deſcribes it under the name of Tartarian Lamb, and has given a print of it. Philoſ. Tranſ. abridged, v. 11. p. 646. but thinks ſome art had been uſed to give it an animal appearance. Dr. Hunter, in his edition of the Terra of Evelyn, has given a more curious print of it, much reſembling a ſheep. The down is uſed in India exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally for ſtopping hemorrhages, and is called golden moſs.</p>
                           <p>The thick downy clothing of ſome vegetables ſeems deſigned to protect them from the injuries of cold, like the wool of animals. Thoſe bodies, which are bad conductors of electricity, are alſo bad conductors of heat, as glaſs, wax, air. Hence either of the two former of theſe may be melted by the flame of a blow-pipe very near the fingers which hold it without burning them; and the laſt, by being confined on the ſurface of animal bodies, in the interſtices of their fur or wool, prevents the eſcape of their natural warmth; to which ſhould be added, that the hairs themſelves are imperfect conductors. The fat or oil of whales, and other northern animals, ſeems deſigned for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of preventing the too ſudden eſcape of the heat of the body in cold climates. Snow protects vegetables which are covered by it from cold, both becauſe it is a bad conductor of heat itſelf, and contains much air in its pores. If a piece of camphor be immerſed in a ſnow-ball, except one extremity of it, on ſetting fire to this, as the ſnow melts, the water becomes abſorbed into the ſurrounding ſnow by capillary, attraction; on this c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, when living animals are buried in ſnow, they are not moſt ned by it; but the cavity enlarges as the ſnow diſſolves, affording them both a dry and warm habitation.</p>

Naturaliſts have not explained the immediate cauſe of the collapſing of the ſenſitive plant; the leaves meet and cloſe in the night during the ſleep of the plant, or when expoſed to much cold in the day-time, in the ſame manner as when they are affected by external violence, fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their upper ſurfaces together, and in part over each other like ſeales or tiles; ſo as to expoſe as little of the upper ſurface as may be to the air; but do not indeed collapſe quite ſo far, ſince I have found, when touched in the night during their ſleep, they fall ſtill further; eſpecially when touched on the foot-ſtalks between the ſtems and the leaflets, which ſeems to be their moſt senſitive or irritable part. Now as their ſituation after being expoſed to external violence resembles their ſleep, but with a greater degree of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe, may it not be owing to a numbneſs or paralyſis conſequent to too violent irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, like the ſaintings of animals from pain or fatigue? I kept a ſenſitive plant in a dark room till ſome hour after day-break; its leaves and leaſ-ſtalks were collapſed as in its moſt proſound ſleep, and on expoſing it to the light, above twenty minutes paſſed before the plant was thoroughly awake and had quite expanded itſelf. During the night the upper or ſmoother ſurfaces of the leaves are appreſſed together; this would ſeem to ſhew that the office of this ſurface of the leaf was to expoſe the fluids of the plant to the light as well as to the air. See note on Helianthus. Many flowers cloſe up their petals during the night. See note on vegetable reſpiration in Part I.</p>

                              <hi>The Swallow.</hi> l. 322. There is a wonderful conformity between the vegetation of ſome plants, and the arrival of certain birds of paſſage. Linneus obſerves that the wood anemone blows in Sweden on the arrival of the ſwallow; and the marſh mary-gold, Caltha, when the cuckoo ſings. Near the ſame coincidence was obſerved in England by Stillingfleet. The word Coccux in Greek ſignifies both a young fig and a cuckoo, which is ſuppoſed to have ariſen from the coincidence of their appearance in Greece. Perhaps a ſimilar coincidence of appearance in ſome parts of Aſia gave occaſion to the ſtory of the loves of the roſe and nightingale, ſo much celebrated by the eaſtern poets. See Dianthus. The times however of the appearance of vegetables in the ſpring ſeem occaſionally to be influenced by their acquired habits, as well as by their ſenſibility to heat: for the roots of potatoes, onions, &amp;c. will germinate with much leſs heat in the ſpring than in the autumn; as is eaſily obſervable where theſe roots are ſtored for uſe; and hence malt is beſt made in the ſpring. 2d. The grains and roots brought from more ſouthern latitudes germinate here ſooner than thoſe which are brought from more northern ones, owing to their acquired habits. Fordyce on Agriculture. 3d. It was obſerved by one of the ſcholars of Linneus, that the apple-trees ſent from hence to New England bloſſomed for a few years too early for that climate, and bore no fruit; but afterwards learnt to accommodate themſelves to their new ſituation. (Kalm's Travels.) 4th. The parts of animals become more ſenſible to heat after having been previouſly expoſed to cold, as our hands glow on coming into the houſe after having held ſnow in them; this ſeems to happen to vegetables; for vines in grape-houſes, which have been expoſed to the winter's cold, will become forwarder and more vigorous than thoſe which have been kept during the winter in the houſe. (Kenedy on Gardening.) This accounts for the very rapid vegetation in the northern latitudes after the ſolution of the ſnows.</p>
                           <p>The increaſe of the irritability of plants in reſpect to heat, after having been previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly expoſed to cold, is further illuſtrated by an experiment of Dr. Walker's. He cut apertures into a birch-tree at different heights; and on the 26th of March ſome of theſe apertures bled, or oozed with the sap-juice, when the thermometer was at 39; which ſame apertures did not bleed on the 13th of March, when the thermometer was at 44. The reaſon of this I apprehend was, becauſe on the night of the 25th the thermometer was as low as 34; whereas on the night of the 12th it was at 41; though the ingenious author aſcribes it to another cauſe.

If mixed with the food of young pigs or chickens, it colours their bones red. If they are fed alternate fortnights with a mixture of madder, and with their uſual food alone, their bones will conſiſt of concentric circles of white and red. Belchier, Phil. Tranſ. 1736. Animals fed with madder for the purpoſe of theſe experiments were found upon diſſection to have thinner gall. Comment. de rebus. Lipſiae. This circumſtance is worth further attention. The colouring materials of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, like thoſe which ſerve the purpoſe of tanning, varniſhing, and the various medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal purpoſes, do not ſeem eſſential to the life of the plant; but ſeem given it as a defence againſt the depredations of inſects or other animals, to whom theſe materials are nauſeous or deleterious. To inſects and many ſmaller animals their colours contribute to conceal them from the larger ones which prey upon them. Caterpillars which feed on leaves are generally green; and earth-worms the colour of the earth which they inhabit; Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies, which frequent flowers, are coloured like them; ſmall birds which frequent hedges have greeniſh backs like the leaves, and light coloured bellies like the ſky, and are hence leſs viſible to the hawk, who paſſes under them or over them. Thoſe birds which are much amongſt flowers, as the gold-finch (Fringilla carduelis), are furniſhed with vivid colours. The lark, partridge, hare, are the colour of the dry vegetables or earth on which they reſt. And frogs vary their colour with the mud of the ſtreams which they frequent; and thoſe which live on trees are green. Fiſh, which are generally ſuſpended in water, and ſwallows, which are generally ſuſpended in air, have their backs the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the diſtant ground, and their bellies of the ſky. In the colder climates many of theſe become white during the exiſtence of the ſnows. Hence there is apparent deſign in the colours of animals, whilſt thoſe of vegetables ſeem conſequent to the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the materials which poſſeſs them.</p>

The warm bath is peculiarly adapted to prevent theſe circumſtances by its increaſing our irritability, and by moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſoftening the ſkin, and the extremities of the finer veſſels, which terminate in it. To thoſe who are paſt the meridian of life, and have dry ſkins, and begin to be emaciated, the warm bath, for half an hour twice a week, I believe to be eminently ferviceable in retarding the advances of age.</p>

Plant. They have their roots at the bottom of the Rhone, the flowers of the female plant float on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the water, and are furniſhed with an elaſtic ſpiral ſtalk, which extends or contracts as the water riſes and falls; this riſe or fall, from the rapid deſcent of the river, and the mountain torrents which flow into it, often amounts to many feet in a few hours. The flowers of the male plant are produced under water, and as ſoon as their farina, or duſt, is mature; they detach themſelves from the plant, and riſe to the ſurface, continue to flouriſh, and are wafted by the air, or borne by the currents to the female flowers. In this reſembling thoſe tribes of inſects, where the males at certain ſeaſons acquire wings, but not the females, as ants, Cocchus, Lampyris, Phalaena, Brumata, Lichanella. Theſe male flowers are in ſuch numbers, though very minute, as frequently to cover the ſurface of the river to conſiderable extent. See Families of Plants tranſlated from Linnéus, P. 677.</p>

This kind of ſea-weed is buoyed up by bladders of air, which are formed in the duplicatures of its leaves; and forms immenſe float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fields of vegetation; the young ones, branching out from the larger ones, and borne on ſimilar little air-veſſels. It is alſo found in the warm baths of Patavia; where the leaves are formed into curious cells or labyrinths for the purpoſe of floating on the water. See ulva labyrinthi-formis Lin. Spec. Plant. The air contained in theſe cells was found by Dr. Prieſtley to be ſometimes purer than common air, and ſometimes leſs pure; the air-bladders of fiſh ſeem to be ſimilar organs, and ſerve to render them buoyant in the water. In ſome of theſe, as in the Cod and Haddock, a red membrane, conſiſting of a great number of leaves or duplicatures, is ſound within the air-bag, which probably ſecretes this air from the blood of the animal. (Monro. Phyſiol. of Fiſh. p. 28.) To determine whether this air, when firſt ſeparated from the blood of the animal or plant, be dephlogiſticated air, is worthy inquiry. The bladder-ſena (Colutea), and bladder-nut (Staphylaea), have their ſeed-veſſels diſtended with air; the Ketmia has the upper joint of the ſtem immediately under the receptacle of the flower much diſtended with air; theſe ſeem to be analogous to the air-veſſel at the broad end of the egg, and may probably become leſs pure as the ſeed ripens: ſome, which I tried, had the purity of the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing atmoſphere. The air at the broad end of the egg is probably an organ ſerving the purpoſe-of reſpiration to the young chick, ſome of whoſe veſſels are ſpread upon it like a placenta, or permeate it. Many are of opinion that even the placenta of the human ſetus, and cotyledons of quadropeds, are reſpiratory organs rather than nutritious ones.</p>
                           <p>The air in the hollow ſtems of graſſes, and of ſome umbelliſerous plants, bears analogy to the air in the quills, and in ſome of the bones of birds; ſupplying the place of the pith, which shrivels up after it has performed its office of protruding the young ſtem or feather. Some of theſe cavities of the bones are ſaid to communicate with the lungs in birds. Phil. Tranſ.</p>
                           <p>The air-bladders of fiſh are nicely adapted to their intended purpoſe; for though they render them buoyant near the ſurface without the labour of uſing their fins, yet, when they reſt at greater depths, they are no inconvenience, as the increaſed preſſure of the water condenſes the air which they contain into leſs ſpace. Thus, if a cork or bladder of air was immerſed a very great depth in the ocean, it would be ſo much compreſſed, as to become ſpecially as heavy as the water, and would remain there. It is probable the unfortunate Mr. Day, who was drowned in a diving-ſhip of his own conſtruction, milcarried from not attending to this circumſtance; it is probable the quantity of air he took down with him, if he deſcended much lower than he expected, was condenſed into ſo ſmall a ſpace as not to render the ſhip buoyant when he endeavoured to aſcend.</p>

                           <p>Tremella. l. 427. Clandeſtine marriage. I have frequently obſerved funguſſes of this Genus on old rails and on the ground to become a tranſparent jelly, after they had been frozen in autumnal mornings; which is a curious property, and diſtinguiſhes them from ſome other vegetable mucilage; for I have obſerved that the paſte, made by boiling wheat-flour in water, ceaſes to be adheſive after having been frozen. I ſuſpected that the Tremella Noſtoc, or ſtar-jelly, alſo had been thus produced; but have ſince been well informed, that the Tremella Noſtoc is a mucilage voided by Herons after they have eaten frogs; hence it has the appearance of having been preſſed through a hole; and limbs of frogs are ſaid ſometimes to be found amongſt it; it is always ſeen upon plains or by the ſides of water, places which Herons generally frequent.</p>
                           <p>Some of the Funguſſes are ſo acrid, that a drop of their juice bliſters the tongue; others intoxicate thoſe who eat them. The Oſtiacks in Siberia uſe them for the latter purpoſe; one Fungus of the ſpecies, Agaricus muſcarum, eaten raw; or the decoction of three of them, produces intoxication for 12 or 16 hours. Hiſtory of Ruſſia. V. I. Nichols. 1780. As all acrid plants become leſs ſo, if expoſed to a boiling heat, it is probable the common muſhroom may ſometimes diſagree from being not ſufficiently ſtewed. The Oſtiacks bliſter their ſkin by a fungus found on Birch-trees; and uſe the Agaricus officin. for Soap. ib.</p>
                           <p>There was a diſpute whether the funguſſes ſhould be claſſed in the animal or vegetable department. Their animal taſte in cookery, and their animal ſmell when burnt, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their tendency to putrefaction, inſomuch that the Phallus impudicus has gained the name of ſtink-horn; and laſtly, their growing and continuing healthy without light, as the Licoperdon tuber or truffle, and the fungus vinoſus or mucor in dark cellars, and the eſculent muſhrooms on beds covered thick with ſtraw, would ſeem to ſhew that they approach towards the animals, or make a kind of iſthmus connecting the two mighty kingdoms of animal and of vegetable nature.</p>

Poetry and Proſe? is it ſolely the melody or meaſure of the

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>I think not ſolely; for ſome proſe has its melody, and even
meaſure. And good verſes, well ſpoken in a language unknown to
the hearer, are not eaſily to be diſtinguiſhed from good proſe.</p>

                     <p>Is it the ſublimity, beauty, or novelty of the ſentiments?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Not ſo; for ſublime ſentiments are often better expreſſed in
proſe. Thus when Warwick in one of the plays of Shakeſpear, is
left wounded on the field after the loſs of the battle, and his friend
ſays to him, "Oh, could you but fly!" what can be more ſublime
than his anſwer, "Why then, I would not fly." No meaſure of
verſe, I imagine, could add dignity to this ſentiment. And it would
be eaſy to ſelect examples of the beautiful or new from proſe writers,
which I ſuppoſe no meaſure of verſe could improve.</p>

                     <p>In what then conſiſts the eſſential difference between Poetry
and Proſe?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Next to the meaſure of the language, the principal diſtinction
appears to me to conſiſt in this: that Poetry admits of but few words
expreſſive of very abſtracted ideas, whereas Proſe abounds with
them. And as our ideas derived from viſible objects are more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
than thoſe derived from the objects of our other ſenſe, the
words expreſſive of theſe ideas belonging to viſion make up the
principal part of poetic language. That is, the Poet writes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0811300400:431"/>
to the eye, the Proſe-writer uſes more abſtracted terms. Mr.
Pope has written a bad verſe in the Windſor Foreſt:
<q>And Kennet ſwift for ſilver Eels <hi>renown'd.</hi>
                        </q>
The word renown'd does not preſent the idea of a viſible object to
the mind, and is thence proſaic. But change this line thus,
<q>And Kennet ſwift, where ſilver Graylings <hi>play.</hi>
                        </q>
and it becomes poetry, becauſe the ſcenery is then brought before
the eye.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>This may be done in proſe.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>And when it is done in a ſingle word, it animates the proſe; ſo
it is more agreeable to read in Mr. Gibbon's Hiſtory, <q>Germany
was at this time <hi>over-ſhadowed</hi> with extenſive foreſts;</q> than
Germany was at this time <hi>full</hi> of extenſive foreſts. But where this
mode of expreſſion occurs too frequently, the proſe approaches to
poetry: and in graver works, where we expect to be inſtructed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than amuſed, it becomes tedious and impertinent. Some parts
of Mr. Burke's eloquent orations become intricate and enervated by
ſuperfluity of poetic ornament; which quantity of ornament would
have been agreeable in a poem, where much ornament is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>

                     <p>In poetry the perſonification or allegoric figure is generally
indiſtinct, and therefore does not ſtrike us ſo forcibly as to make us
attend to its improbability; but in painting, the figures being all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0811300400:433"/>
much more diſtinct, their improbability becomes apparent, and ſeizes
our attention to it. Thus the perſon of Concealment is very indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
and therefore does not compel us to attend to its improbability,
in the following beautiful lines of Shakeſpear:
<q>
                           <l>—She never told her love;</l>
                           <l>But let Concealment, like a worm i' th' bud,</l>
                           <l>Feed on her damaſk cheek.—</l>
                        </q>
But in theſe lines below the perſon of Reaſon obtrudes itſelf into our
company, and becomes diſagreeable by its diſtinctneſs, and cones<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
improbability.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>To Reaſon I flew, and intreated her aid,</l>

                        <l>Then gravely reply'd in return to my prayer,</l>
                        <l>That Hebe was faireſt of all that were fair.</l>
                        <l>That's a truth, reply'd I, I've no need to be taught,</l>
                        <l>I came to you, Reaſon, to find out a fault.</l>
                        <l>If that's all, ſays Reaſon, return as you came,</l>
                        <l>To find fault with Hebe would forfeit my name.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>Allegoric figures are on this account in general leſs manageable
in painting and in ſtatuary than in poetry: and can ſeldom be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in the two former arts in company with natural figures, as is
evident from the ridiculous effect of many of the paintings of Rubens
in the Luxemburgh gallery; and for this reaſon, becauſe their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability
becomes more ſtriking, when there are the figures of
real perſons by their ſide to compare them with.</p>

Mrs. Angelica Kauffman, well appriſed of this circumſtance, has
introduced no mortal figures amongſt her Cupids and her Graces. And
the great Roubiliac, in his unrivalled monument of Time and Fame
ſtruggling for the trophy of General Fleming, has only hung up a
medallion of the head of the hero of the piece. There are however
ſome allegoric figures, which we have ſo often heard deſcribed or
ſeen delineated, that we almoſt forget that they do not exiſt in
common life; and hence view them without aſtoniſhment; as the
figures of the heathen mythology, of angels, devils, death and time;
and almoſt believe them to be realities, even when they are mixed
with repreſentations of the natural forms of man. Whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that a certain degree of probability is neceſſary to prevent us
from revolting with diſtaſte from unnatural images; unleſs we are
otherwiſe ſo much intereſted in the contemplation of them as not to
perceive their improbability.</p>

                     <p>Is this reaſoning about degrees of probability juſt?—When Sir
Joſhua Reynolds, who is unequalled both in the theory and practice
of his art, and who is a great maſter of the pen as well as the pencil,
has aſſerted in a diſcourſe delivered to the Royal Academy, December
11, 1786, that <q>the higher ſtyles of painting, like the higher kinds
of the Drama, do not aim at any thing like deception; or have
any expectation, that the ſpectators ſhould think the events there
repreſented are really paſſing before them.</q> And he then accuſes
Mr. Fielding of bad judgment, when he attempts to compliment
Mr. Garrick in one of his novels, by introducing an ignorant man,
miſtaking the repreſentation of a ſcene in Hamlet for a reality; and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0811300400:435"/>
thinks, becauſe he was an ignorant man, he was leſs liable to make
ſuch a miſtake.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>It is a metaphyſical queſtion, and requires more attention than
Sir Joſhua has beſtowed upon it.—You will allow, that we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
deceived in our dreams; and that even in our waking reveries,
we are often ſo much abſorbed in the contemplation of what paſſes
in our imaginations, that for a while we do not attend to the lapſe
of time or to our own locality; and thus ſuffer a ſimilar kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
as in our dreams. That is, we believe things preſent before
our eyes, which are not ſo.</p>
                     <p>There are two circumſtances, which contribute to this compleat
deception in our dreams. Firſt, becauſe in ſleep the organs of ſenſe
are cloſed or inert, and hence the trains of ideas aſſociated in our
imaginations are never interrupted or diſſerered by the irritations of
external objects, and can not therefore be contraſted with our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.
On this account, though we are affected with a variety of
paſſions in our dreams, as anger, love, joy; yet we never experience
ſurprize.—For ſurprize is only produced when any external irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſuddenly obtrude themſelves, and diſſever our paſſing trains of
ideas.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe in ſleep there is a total ſuſpenſion of our volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
power, both over the muſcles of our bodies, and the ideas of our
minds; for we neither walk about, nor reaſon in compleat ſleep.
Hence, as the trains of ideas are paſſing in our imaginations in dreams,
we cannot compare them with our previous knowledge of things, as
we do in our waking hours; for this is a voluntary exertion; and
thus we cannot perceive their incongruity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0811300400:436"/>
Thus we are deprived in ſleep of the only two means by which we
can diſtinguiſh the trains of ideas paſſing in our imaginations, from
thoſe excited by our ſenſations; and are led by their vivacity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them to belong to the latter. For the vivacity of theſe trains
of ideas, paſſing in the imagination, is greatly increaſed by the cauſes
above-mentioned; that is, by their not being diſturbed or diſſevered
either by the appulſes of external bodies, as in ſurprize; or by our
voluntary exertions in comparing them with our previous knowledge
of things, as in reaſoning upon them.</p>

                     <p>When by the art of the Painter or Poet a train of ideas is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
to our imaginations, which intereſts us ſo much by the pain

common external objects, and ceaſe alſo to uſe any voluntary efforts
to compare theſe intereſting trains of ideas with our previous know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of things, a compleat reverie is produced: during which time,
however ſhort, if it be but for a moment, the objects themſelves
appear to exiſt before us. This, I think, has been called by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
critic "the ideal preſence" of ſuch objects. (Elements of
Criticiſm by Lord Kaimes). And in reſpect to the compliment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

                     <p>Not if they ſo much intereſt the reader or ſpectator as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the reverie above deſcribed. Nature may be ſeen in the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
or at the card-table; but we expect ſomething more than this
in the play-houſe or picture-room. The further the artiſts recedes
from nature, the greater novelty he is likely to produce; if he riſes
above nature, he produces the ſublime; and beauty is probably a
ſelection and new combination of her moſt agreeable parts. Your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
will be ſenſible of the truth of this doctrine by recollecting over
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0811300400:438"/>
in your mind the works of three of our celebrated artiſts. Sir Joſhua
Reynolds has introduced ſublimity even into its protraits; we admire
the repreſentation of perſons, whoſe reality we ſhould have paſſed
by unnoticed. Mrs. Angelica Kauffman attracts our eyes with
beauty, which I ſuppoſe no where exiſts; certainly few Grecian faces
are ſeen in this country. And the daring pencil of Fuſeli tranſports
us beyond the boundaries of nature, and raviſhes us with the charm
of the moſt intereſting novelty. And Shakeſpear, who excells in all
theſe together, ſo far captivates the ſpectator, as to make him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful
of every kind of violation of Time, Place, or Exiſtence.
As at the firſt appearance of the Ghoſt of Hamlet, <q>his ear muſt
be dull as the fat weed, which roots itſelf on Lethe's brink,</q> who
can attend to the improbality of the exhibition. So in many ſcenes
of the Tempeſt we perpetually believe the action paſſing before our
eyes, and relapſe with ſomewhat of diſtaſte into common life at the
intervals of the repreſentation.</p>

The feeds of this and of many other plants of the ſame claſs are furniſhed with a plume, by which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable mechaniſm they perform long aërial journeys, croſſing lakes and deſerts, and are thus diſſeminated far from the original plant, and have much the appearance of a Shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlecock as they fly. The wings are of different conſtruction, ſome being like a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent tuft of hairs, others are branched like feathers, ſome are elevated from the crown of the feed by a ſlender foot-ſtalk, which gives them a very elegant appearance, others ſit immediately on the crown of the ſeed.</p>
                           <p>Nature has many other curious vegetable contrivances for the diſperſion of ſeeds: ſee note on Helianthus. But perhaps none of them has more the appearance of deſign than the admirable apparatus of Tillandſia for this purpoſe. This plant grows on the branches of trees, like the miſleto, and never on the ground; the ſeeds are furniſhed with many long threads on their crowns; which, as they are driven forwards by the winds, wrap round the arms of trees, and thus hold them laſt till they vegetate. This is very analogous to the migration of Spiders on the goſsamer, who are ſaid to attach themſelves to the end of a long thread, and riſe thus to the tops of trees or buildings, as the accidental breezes carry them.</p>

On the river Derwent near Matlock in Derbyſhire, Sir RICHARD ARKWRIGHT has erected his curious and magnificent machinery for ſpinning cotton; which had been in vain attempted by many ingenious artiſts before him. The cotton-wool is firſt picked from the pods and ſeeds by women. It is then c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>rded by <hi>cylindrical cards</hi> which move againſt each other, with different ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities. It is taken from theſe by an iron-hand or comb, which has a motion ſimilar to that of ſcratching, and takes the wool off the cards longitudinally in reſpect to the fibres or ſtaple, producing a continued line looſely cohering, called the <hi>Rove</hi> or <hi>Roving.</hi> This Rove, yet very looſely twiſted, is then received or drawn into a <hi>whirling caniſter,</hi> and is rolled by the centrifugal force in ſpiral lines within it; being yet too tender for the ſpindle. It is then paſſed between <hi>two pairs of rollers;</hi> the ſecond pair moving faſter than the firſt elongate the thread with greater equality than can be done by the hand; and is then twiſted on ſpoles or bobbins.</p>
                           <p>The great fertility of the Cotton-plant in theſe fine flexile threads, whilſt theſe from Flax, Hemp, and Nettles, or from the bark of the Mulberry-tree, require a previous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefection of the parenchymatous ſubſtance, and much mechanical labour, and afterwards bleaching, renders this plant of great importance to the world. And ſince Sir Richard Arkwright's ingenious machine has not only greatly abbreviated and ſimpleſied the labour and art of carding and ſpinning the Cotton-wool, but performs both theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances <hi>better</hi> than can be done by hand, it is probable, that the clothing of this ſnall ſeed will become the principal clothing of mankind; though animal wool and ſilk may be preferable in colder climates, as they are more imperfect conductors of heat, and are thence a warmer clothing.</p>

Before the invention of letters mankind may be ſaid to have been perpatually in their infancy, as the arts of one age or country generally died with their inventors.

She began this work at the age of 74, when her ſight would no longer ſerve her to paint, in which ſhe much excelled; between her age of 74 and 82, at which time her eyes quite failed her, ſhe executed the curious Hortus ſiccus above-mentioned, which 1 ſuppoſe contains a greater number of plants than were ever before drawn from the life by any one perſon. Her method conſiſted in placing the leaves of each plant with the petals, and all the other parts of the flowers, on coloured paper, and cutting them with ſciſſars accurately to the natural ſize and form, and then paſting them on a dark ground; the effect of which is wonderful, and their accuracy leſs liable to ſallacy than drawings. She is at this time (1788) in her 89th year, with all the powers of a fine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſtill unimpaired. I am informed another very ingenious lady, Mrs. North, is conſtructing a ſimilar Hortus ſiccus, or Paper-garden; which ſhe executes on a ground of vellum with ſuch elegant taſte and ſcientific accuracy, that it cannot fail to become a work of ineſtimable value.</p>

And many other flowers cloſe and open their petals at certain hours of the day; and thus conſtitute what Linneus calls the Horologe, or Watch of Flora. He enumerates 46 flowers, which poſſeſs this kind of ſenſibility. I ſhall mention a few of them with their reſpective hours of riſing and ſetting, as Linneus terms them. He divides them firſt into <hi>meteoric</hi> flowers, which leſs accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve the hour of unfolding, but are expanded ſooner or later, according to the cloudineſs, moiſture, or preſſure of the atmoſphere. 2d. <hi>Tropical</hi> flowers open in the morning and cloſe before evening every day; but the hour of the expanding becomes earlier or later, as the length of the day increaſes or decreaſes. 3dly. <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which open at a certain and exact hour of the day, and for the moſt part cloſe at another determinate hour.</p>
                           <p>Hence the Horologe or Watch of Flora is formed from numerous plants, of which the following are thoſe moſt common in this country. Leontodon taraxacum, Dandelion, opens at 5—6, cloſes at 8—9. Hieracium piloſella, mouſe-ear hawkweed, opens at 8, cloſes at 2. Sonchus laevis, ſmooth Sow-thiſtle, at 5 and at 11—12. Lactuca ſativa, cultivated Lettice, at 7 and 10. Tragopogon luteum, yellow Goatſbeard, at 3—5 and at 9—10. Lapſana, nipplewort, at 5—6 and at 10—1. Nymphaea alba, white water lily, at 7 and 5. Papaver nudicaule, naked poppy, at 5 and at 7. Hemerocallis fulva, tawny Day-lily, at 5 and at 7—8. Convolvulus, at 5—6. Malva, Mallow, at 9—10, and at 1. Arenarea purpurea, purple Sandwort, at 9—10, and at 2—3. Anagallis, pimpernel, at 7—8. Portulaca hortenſis, garden Purſlain, at 9—10, and at 11—12. Dianthus prolifer, proliferous Pink, at 8 and at 1.

After impregnation the flower undergoes a remarkable change, the nectaries, drop off, but the white corol remains, and gradually becomes quite green. This curious metamorph ſe of the corol, when the nectaries fall off, ſeems to ſhew that the white juices of the corol were before carried to the nectaries, for the purpoſe of producing honey: becauſe when theſe nectaries fall off, no more of the white juice is ſecreted in the corol, but it becomes green, and degenerates into a calyx. See note on Lonicera. The nectary of the Tropaeolum, garden naſturtien, is a coloured horn grewing from the calyx.</p>

The plants of this claſs are almoſt all of them poiſonous; the fineſl opium is procured by wounding the heads of large poppies with a three-edged kniſe, and tying muſcle-ſhells to them to catch the drops. In ſmall quantities it exhilarates the mind, raiſes the paſſions, and invigorates the body: in large ones it is ſuccceded by intoxication, languor, ſtupor and death. It is cuſtomary in India for a meſſenger to travel above a hundred miles without reſt or food, except an appropriated bit of opium for himſelf, and a larger one for his horſe at certain ſtages. The emaciated and decrepid appearance, with the ridiculous and idiotic geſtures, of the opium-eaters in Conſtantinople is well deſcribed in the Memoirs of Baron de Tott.</p>

The moſt beautiful flowers of the Cactus grandiflorus (ſee Cerea) are of equally ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but have their exiſtence in the night. And the flowers of the Hibiſcus trionum are ſaid to continue but a ſingle hour. The courtſhip between the males and females in theſe flowers might be eaſily watched; the males are ſaid to approach and recede from the females alternately. The flowers of the Hibiſcus ſinenſis, mutable roſe, live in the Weſt Indies, their native climate, but one day; but have this remarkable property, they are white at the firſt expanſion, then change to deep red, and become purple as they decay.</p>
                           <p>The gum or reſin of this fragrant vegetable is collected from extenſive underwoods of it in the Eaſt by a ſingular contrivance. Long leathern thongs are tied to poles and cords, and drawn over the tops of theſe ſhrubs about noon; which thus collect the duſt of the anthers, which adheres to the leather, and is occaſionally ſcraped off. Thus in ſome degree is the manner imitated, in which the bee collects on his thighs and legs the ſame material for the conſtruction of his combs.</p>

The effect of this plant in that kind of Dropſy, which is termed anaſarca, where the legs and thighs are much ſwelled, attended with great difficulty of breathing, is truly aſtoniſhing. In the aſcites accompanied with anaſarca of people paſt the meridian of life it will alſo ſometimes ſucceed. The method of adminiſtering it requires ſome cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is liable, in greater doſes, to induce very violent and debilitating ſickneſs, which continues one or two days, during which time the dropſical collection however diſappears. One large ſpoonful, or half an ounce, of the following decoction, given twice a day, will generally ſucceed in a few days. But in more robuſt people, one large ſpoonful every two hours, till four ſpoonfuls are taken, or till ſickneſs occurs, will eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the dropſical ſwellings with greater certainty, but is liable to operate more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently. Boil four ounces of the freſh leaves of purple Foxglove (which leaves may be had at all ſeaſons of the year) from two pints of water to twelve ounces; add to the ſtrained liquor, while yet warm, three ounces of rectified ſpirit of wine. A theory of the effects of this medicine, with many ſucceſsful caſes, may be ſeen in a pamphlet, called, " Experiments on Mucilaginous and Purulent Matter," publiſhed by Dr. Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win in 1780.

During the great Plague at London in the year 1665, Sir John Lawrence, the then Lord Mayor, continued the whole time in the city; heard complaints, and redreſſed them; enforced the wiſeſt regulations then known, and ſaw them executed. The day after the diſeaſe was known with certainty to be the Plague, above 40,000 ſervants were diſmiſſed, and turned into the ſtreets to periſh, for no one would receive them into their houſes; and the villages near London drove them away with pitch-forks and fire-arms. Sir John Lawrence ſupported them all, as well as the needy who were ſick, at firſt by expending his own fortune, till ſubſcriptions could be ſolicited and received from all parts of the nation. <hi>Journal of the Plague-year.

                     <p>THE monſters of your Botanic Garden are as ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
as the bulls with brazen feet, and the fire-breathing
dragons, which guarded the Heſperian fruit; yet are they
not diſguſting, nor miſchievous: and in the manner you have
chained them together in your exhibition, they ſucceed each other
amuſingly enough, like prints of the London Cries, wrapped upon
rollers, with a glaſs before them. In this at leaſt they reſemble the
monſters in Ovid's Metamorphoſes; but your ſimilies, I ſuppoſe,
are Homeric?</p>

                     <p>The great Bard well underſtood how to make uſe of this
kind of ornament in Epic Poetry. He brings his valiant heroes
into the field with much parade, and ſets them a fighting with great
fury; and then, after a few thruſts and parries, he introduces a long
ſtring of ſimilies. During this the battle is ſuppoſed to continue;
and thus the time neceſſary for the action is gained in our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0811300400:474"/>
and a degree of probability produced, which contributes to
the temporary deception or reverie of the reader.</p>
                     <p>But the ſimilies of Homer have another agreeable characteriſtic;
they do not quadrate, or go upon all fours (as it is called), like the
more formal ſimilies of ſome modern writers; any one reſembling
feature ſeems to be with him a ſufficient excuſe for the introduction
of this kind of digreſſion; he then proceeds to deliver ſome agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
poetry on this new ſubject, and thus converts every ſimile into
a kind of ſhort epiſode.</p>

                     <p>No; it would then become a philoſophical analogy, it would
be ratiocination inſtead of poetry: it need only ſo far reſemble the
ſubject, as poetry itſelf ought to reſemble nature. It ſhould have
ſo much ſublimity, beauty, or novelty, as to intereſt the reader;
and ſhould be expreſſed in pictureſque language, ſo as to bring the
ſcenery before his eye; and ſhould laſtly bear ſo much veri-ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
as not to awaken him by the violence of improbability or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity.</p>

                     <p>Certainly; he will endeavour to rouſe himſelf from a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
reverie, as from the night-mare. And from this may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the line of boundary between the Tragic and the Horrid:
which line, however, will veer a little this way or that, according to
the prevailing manners of the age or country, and the peculiar aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations
of ideas, or idioſyncracy of mind, of individuals. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
if an artiſt ſhould repreſent the death of an officer in battle,
by ſhewing a little blood on the boſom of his ſhirt, as if a bullet
had there penetrated, the dying figure would affect the beholder
with pity; and if fortitude was at the ſame time expreſſed in his
countenance, admiration would be added to our pity. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if the artiſt ſhould chuſe to repreſent his thigh as ſhot away
by a cannon ball, and ſhould exhibit the bleeding fleſh and ſhattered
bone of the ſtump, the picture would introduce into our minds ideas
from a butcher's ſhop, or a ſurgeon's operation-room, and we ſhould
turn from it with diſguſt. So if characters were brought upon the
ſtage with their limbs diſjointed by torturing inſtruments, and the
floor covered with clotted blood and ſcattered brains, our theatric
reverie would be deſtroyed by diſguſt, and we ſhould leave the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
with deteſtation.</p>
                     <p>The Painters have been more guilty in this reſpect than the
Poets; the cruelty of Apollo in flaying Marcias alive is a favourite
ſubject with the antient artiſts: and the tortures of expiring mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
have diſgraced the modern ones. It requires little genius to
exhibit the muſcles in convulſive action either by the pencil or
the chiffel, becauſe the interſtices are deep, and the lines ſtrongly
defined: but thoſe tender gradations of muſcular action, which
conſtitute the graceful attitudes of the body, are difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
or to execute, except by a maſter of nice diſcernment and
cultivated taſte.</p>

                     <p>I ſuppoſe the latter conſiſts of Diſtreſs attended with Pity,
which is ſaid to be allied to Love, the moſt agreeable of all our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and the former in Diſtreſs, accompanied with Diſguſt, which
is allied to Hate, and is one of our moſt diſagreeable ſenſations.
Hence, when horrid ſcenes of cruelty are repreſented in pictures, we
wiſh to diſbelieve their exiſtence, and voluntarily exert ourſelves to
eſcape from the deception: whereas the bitter cup of true Tragedy
is mingled with ſome ſweet conſolatory drops, which endear our
tears, and we continue to contemplate the intereſting deluſion with
a delight which it is not eaſy to explain.</p>

                     <p>Has not this been explained by Lucretius, where he deſcribes
a ſhipwreck; and ſays, the Spectators receive pleaſure from feeling
themſelves ſafe on land? and by Akenſide, in his beautiful poem on
the Pleaſures of Imagination, who aſcribes it to our finding objects
for the due exertion of our paſſions?</p>

                     <p>We muſt not confound our ſenſations at the contemplation of
real miſery with thoſe which we experience at the ſcenical repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
of tragedy. The ſpectators of a ſhipwreck may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by the dignity and novelty of the object; and from theſe
may be ſaid to receive pleaſure; but not from the diſtreſs of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers.
An ingenious writer, who has criticiſed this dialogue in the
Engliſh Review for Auguſt, 1789, adds, that one great ſource of our
pleaſure from ſcenical diſtreſs ariſes from our, at the ſame time,
generally contemplating one of the nobleſt objects of nature, that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0811300400:477"/>
of Virtue triumphant over every difficulty and oppreſſion, or ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its votary under every ſuffering: or, where this does not occur,
that our minds are relieved by the juſtice of ſome ſignal puniſhment
awaiting the delinquent. But, beſides this, at the exhibition of a good
tragedy, we are not only amuſed by the dignity, and novelty, and
beauty, of the objects before us; but, if any diſtreſſful circumſtances
occur too forcible for our ſenſibility, we can voluntarily exert our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and recollect, that the ſcenery is not real: and thus not only
the pain, which we had received from the apparent diſtreſs, is
leſſened, but a new ſource of pleaſure is opened to us, ſimilar to that
which we frequently have felt on awaking from a diſtreſſful
dream; we are glad that it is not true. We are at the ſame time
unwilling to relinquiſh the pleaſure which we receive from the other
intereſting circumſtances of the drama; and on that account quickly
permit ourſelves to relapſe into the deluſion; and thus alternately
believe and diſbelieve, almoſt every moment, the exiſtence of the
objects repreſented before us.</p>

It was much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the myſteries of witchcraft, and for the purpoſe of raiſing the devil, as its name imports. It grows amid the mouldering bones and decayed coffins in the ruinous vaults of Sleaford-church in Lincolnſhire. The ſuperſtitious ceremonies or hiſories belonging to ſome vegetables have been truly ridiculous; thus the Druids are ſaid to have cropped the Miſletoe with a golden axe or ſickle; and the Bryony, or Mandrake, was ſaid to utter a ſcream when its root was drawn from the ground; and that the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal which drew it up became diſeaſed and ſoon died: on which account, when it was wanted for the purpoſes of medicine, it was uſual to looſen and remove the earth about the root, and then to tie it by means of a cord to a dog's tail, who was whipped to pull it up, and was then ſuppoſed to ſuffer for the impiety of the action. And even at this day bits of dried root of Peony are rubbed ſmooth, and ſtrung, and ſold under the name of Anodyne necklaces, and tied round the necks of children, to facilitate the growth of their teeth! add to this, that in Price's Hiſtory of Cornwall, a book publiſhed about ten years ago, the Virga Divinatoria, or Divining Rod, has a degree of credit given to it. This rod is of hazle, or other light wood, and held horizontally in the hand, and is ſaid to bow towards the ore whenver the Conjurer walks over a mine. A very few years ago, in France, and even in England, another kind of divining rod has been uſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſprings of water in a ſimilar manner, and gained ſome credit. And in the very laſt year, there were many in France, and ſome in England, who underwent an enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without any divining rod at all, and believed themſelves to be affected by an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible agent, which the Enchanter called Animal Magnetiſm!</p>

The Pythian prieſteſs is ſuppoſed to have been made drunk with infuſion of laurel-leaves when ſhe delivered her oracles. The intoxication or inſpiration is finely deſcribed by Virgil. Aen. L. vi. The diſtilled water from laurel-leaves is, perhaps, the moſt ſudden poiſon we are acquainted with in this country. I have ſeen about two ſpoonfuls of it deſtroy a large pointer dog in leſs than ten minutes. In a ſmaller doſe it is ſaid to produce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication; on this account there is reaſon to believe it acts in the ſame manner as opium and vinous ſpirit; but that the doſe is not ſo well aſcertained. See note on Tremella. It is uſed in the Ratafie of the diſtillers, by which ſome dram-drinkers have been ſuddenly killed. One pint of water, diſtilled from fourteen pounds of black cherry ſtones bruiſed, has the ſame deleterious effect, deſtroying as ſuddenly as laurel-water.

Sleep conſiſts in the abolition of all voluntary power, both over our muſcular motions and our ideas; for we neither walk nor reaſon in ſleep. But, at the ſame time, many of our muſcular motions, and many of our ideas, continue to be excited into action in conſequence of internal irritations and of internal ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for the heart and arteries continue to beat, and we experience variety of paſſions, and even hunger and thirſt in our dreams. Hence I conclude, that our nerves of ſenſe are not torpid or inert during ſleep; but that they are only precluded from the perception of external objects, by their external organs being rendered unfit to tranſmit to them the appu<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

See firſt Interlude.</p>
                           <p>When there ariſes in ſleep a painful deſire to exert the voluntary motions, it is called the Nightmare or Incubus. When the ſleep becomes ſo imperfect that ſome muſcular motions obey this exertion of deſire, people have walked about, and even performed ſome domeſtic offices in ſleep; one of theſe ſleep-walkers I have frequently ſeen: once ſhe ſmelt of a tube-roſe, and ſung, and drank a diſh of tea in this ſtate; her awaking was always attended with prodigious ſurprize, and even fear; this diſeaſe had daily periods, and ſeemed to be of the epileptic kind.</p>

Near the village of Wetton, a mile or two above Dove-Dale, near Aſhburn in Derbyſhire, there is a ſpacious cavern about the middle of the aſcent of the mountain, which ſtill retains the Name of Thor's houſe; below is an extenſive and romantic common, where the rivers Hamps and Manifold ſink into the earth, and riſe again in Ilam gardens, the ſeat of John Port, Eſq. about three mile below. Where theſe rivers riſe again there are impreſſions reſembling Fiſh, which appear to be of Jaſper bedded in Limeſtone. Calcareous Spars, Shells converted into a kind of Agate, corallines in Marble, ores of Lead, Copper, and Zinc, and many ſtrata of Flint, or Chert, and of Toadſtone, or Lava, abound in thi part of the country. The Druids are ſaid to have offered human ſacrifices incloſed in wicker idols to Thor. Thurſday had its name from this Deity.</p>

One of the eſſential oils, that of turpentine, is recommended, by M. de Thoffe, for the purpoſe of deſtroying inſects which infect both vegetables and animals. Having obſerved that the trees were attacked by multitudes of ſmall inſects of different colours (pucins ou purrons), which injured their young branches, he deſtroyed them all intinaely in the following manner: he put into a bowl a few handfuls of earth, on which he poured a ſmall quantity of oil of turpentine; he then beat the whole toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a ſpatula, p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Printemp. p. 109. I ſprinkled ſome oil of turpentine, by means of a bruſh, on ſome branches of a nectarine-tree, which was covered with the aphis; but it killed both the inſect and the branches: a ſolution of arſenic much diluted did the ſame. The ſhops of medicine are ſupplied with reſins, balſams, and eſſential oils; and the tar and pitch, for mechanical purpoſes, are produced from theſe vegetable ſecretions.</p>

With the milky juice of this tree the Indians poiſon their arrows; the dew-drops, which fall from it, are ſo cauſtic as to bliſter the ſkin, and produce dangerous ulcers; whence many have found their death by ſleeping under its ſhade. Variety of noxious plants abound in all countries; in our own the deadly night-ſhade, henbane, hounds-tongue, and many others, are ſeen in almoſt every high road un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched by animals. Some have aſked, what is the uſe of ſuch abundance of poiſons? The nauſeous or pungent juices of ſome vegetables, like the thorns of others, are given them for their defence from the depredations of animals; hence the thorny plants are in general wholeſome and agreeable food to graminivorous animals. See note on Ilex. The flowers or petals of plants are perhaps in general more acrid than their leaves; hence they are much ſeldomer eaten by inſects. This ſeems to have been the uſe of the eſſential oil in the vegetable economy, as obſerved above in the notes on Dictamnus and on Ilex. The fragrance of plants is thus a part of their defence. Theſe pungent or nauſeous juices of vegetables have ſupplied the ſcience of medicine with its principal materials, ſuch as purge, vomit, intoxicate, &amp;c.</p>

The vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table poiſons, like the animal ones, produce more ſudden and dangerous effects, when inſtilled into a wound, than when taken into the ſtomach; whence the families of Marſi and Pſilli, in antient Rome, ſucked the poiſon without injury out of wounds made by vipers, and were ſuppoſed to be indued with ſupernatural powers for this purpoſe. By the experiments related by Beccaria, it appears that four or five times the quantity, taken by the mouth, had about equal effects with that infuſed into a wound.

There is a poiſon-tree in the iſtand of Java, which is ſaid by its effluvia to have depopulated the country for 12 or 14 miles round the place of its growth. It is called, in the Malayan language, Bohon-Upas; with the juice of it the moſt poiſonous arrows are prepared; and, to gain this, the condemned criminals are ſent to the tree with proper direction both to get the juice and to ſecure themſelves from the malignant exhalations of the tree; and are pardoned if they bring back a certain quantity of the poiſon. But by the regiſters there kept, not one in four are ſaid to return. Not only animals of all kinds, both quadrupeds, fiſh, and birds, but all kinds of vegetables alſo are deſtroyed by the effluvia of the noxious tree; ſo that, in a diſtrict of 12 or 14 miles round it, the face of the earth is quite barren and rocky, intermixed only with the ſke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letons of men and animals; affording a ſcene of melancholy beyond what poets have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed or painters delineated.

                              <hi>Orchis.</hi> l. 259. The Orchis morio in the circumſtance of the parent-root ſhrivelling up and dying, as the young one increaſes, is not only analogous to other tuberous or knobby roots, but alſo to ſome bulbous roots, as the tulip. The manner of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of herbaceous plants from their various perennial roots, ſeems to want further inveſtigation, as their analogy is not yet clearly eſtabliſhed. The caudex, or true root, in the orchis lies above the knob; and from this part the fibrous roots and the new knob are produced. In the tulip the caudex lies below the bulb; from whence proceed the fibrous roots and the new bulbs; and I ſuſpect the tulip-root, after it has flowered, dies like the orchis-root; for the ſtem of the laſt year's tulip lies on the outſide, and not in the center of the new bulb; which I am informed does not happen in the three or four firſt years when raiſed from feed, when it only produces a ſtem, and ſlender leaves without flowering. In the tulip-root, diſſected in the early ſpring, juſt before it begins to ſhoot, a perfect flower is ſeen in its center; and between the firſt and ſecond coat the large next year's bulb is, I believe, produced; between the ſecond and third coat, and between this and the fourth coat, and perhaps further, other leſs and leſs bulls are viſible, all adjoining to the caudex at the bottom of the mother-bulb; and which, I am told, require as many years before they will flower, as the number of the coats with which they are covered. This annual reproduction of the tulip-root induces ſome floriſts to believe that tulip-roots never die naturally, as they loſe ſo few of them; whereas the hyacinth-roots, I am informed, will not laſt above five or ſeven years after they have flowered.</p>
                           <p>The hyacinth-root differs from the tulip-root, as the ſtem of the laſt year's flower is always found in the center of the root, and the new off-ſets ariſe from the caudex below the bulb, but not beneath any of the concentric coats of the root, except the external one: hence Mr. Eaton, an ingenious floriſt of Derby, to whom I am indebted for moſt of the obſervations in this note, concludes, that the hyacinth-root does not periſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually after it has flowered like the tulip. Mr. Eaton gave me a tulip root which had been ſet too deep in the earth, and the caudex had elongated itſelf near an inch, and the new bulb was formed above the old one, and detached from it, inſtead of adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its ſide.</p>
                           <p>The caudex of the ranunculus, cultivated by the floriſts, lies above the claw-like root; in this the old root or claws die annually, like the tulip and orchis, and the new claws, which are ſeen above the old ones, draw down the caudex lower into the earth. The ſame is ſaid to happen to Scabioſa, or Devil's bit, and ſome other plants, as vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian and greater plantain; the new fibrous roots riſing round the caudex above the old ones, the inferior end of the root becomes ſtumped, as if cut off, after the old fibrous are decayed, and the caudex is drawn down into the earth by theſe new roots. See Arum and Tulipa.</p>

This paraſite plant (the ſeed ſplitting without cotyledons), protruces a ſpiral body, and not endeavouring to root itſelf in the earth aſcends the vegetables in its vicinity, ſpirally W. S. E. or contrary to the movement of the ſun; and abſorbs its nouriſhment by veſſels apparently inſerted into its ſupporters. It bears no leaves, except here and there a ſcale, very ſmall, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous, and cloſe under the branch. Lin. Spec. Plant. edit. a Reichard. Vol. I. p. 352. The Rev. T. Martyn, in his elegant letters on botany, adds, that, not content with support, where it lays hold, there it draws its nourishment; and at length, in gratitude for all this, ſtrangles its entertainer. Let. xv. A conteſt for air and light obtains throughout the whole vegetable world; ſhrubs riſe above herbs; and, by precluding the air and light from them, injure or deſtroy them; trees ſuffocate or incommode ſhrubs; the paraſite climbing plants, as Ivy, Clematis, incommode the taller trees; and other paraſites, which exiſt without having roots on the ground, as Miſletoe, Tillan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Others turn their ſpiral ſtems weſt-ſouth-eaſt, as convolvulus, Corn-bind, Phaſeolus, Kidney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bean, Baſella, Cynanche, Euphorbia, Eupatorium. The proximate or final cauſes of this difference have not been inveſtigated. Other plants are furniſhed with tendrils for the purpoſe of climbing: if the tendril meets with nothing to lay hold of in its firſt revolution, it makes another revolution; and ſo on till it wraps itſelf quite up like a cork-crew; hence, to a careleſs obſerver, it appears to move gradually backwards and forwards, being ſeen ſometimes pointing eaſtward and sometimes westward. One of the Indian grasses, Panicum arboreſcens, whoſe ſtem is no thicker than a gooſe-quill, riſes as high as the talleſt trees in this conteſt for light and air. Spec. Plant a Reichard, Vol. I. p. 161. The tops of many climbing plants are tender from their quick growth; and, when deprived of their acrimony by boiling, are an agreeable article of food. The Hop tops are in common uſe. I have eaten the tops of white Bryony, Bryonia alba, and found them nearly as grateful as Aſparagus, and think this plant might be profitably cultivated as an early garden-vegetable. The Tamus (called black Bryony), was leſs agreeable to the taſte when boiled. See Galanthus.</p>

And it has thus become the curſe of the Chriſtian world, producing more than half of our chronical diſeaſes; which Mahomet obſerved, and forbade the uſe of it to his diſciples.

The antient ſtory of Prometheus, who concealed in his boſom the fire he had ſtolen, and afterwards had a vulture perpetually gnawing his liver, affords ſo apt an allegory for the effects of drinking ſpirituous liquors, that one ſhould be induced to think the art of diſtillation, as well as ſome other chemical proceſſes (ſuch as calcining gold), had been known in times of great antiquity, and loſt again. The ſwallowing drams cannot be better repreſented in hieroglyphic language than by taking fire into one's boſom; and certain it is, that the general effect of drinking fermented on ſpirituous liquors is an inflamed, ſchirrous, or paralytic liver, with its varioas critical or conſequential diſeases, as leprous eruptions on the face, gout, dropſy, epilepſy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanity.

Some philoſophers have believed that the continent of America was not raiſed out of the great ocean at ſo early a period of time as the other continents. One reaſon for this opinion was, becauſe the great lakes, perhaps nearly as large as the Mediterranean Sea, conſiſt of fresh water. And as the ſea-ſalt ſeems to have its origin from the deſtruction of vegetable and animal bodies, waſhed down by rains, and carried by rivers into lakes or ſeas; it would ſeem that this ſource of ſea-ſalt had not ſo long exiſted in that country. There is, however, a more ſatisfactory way of explaining this circumſtance; which is, that the American lakes lie above the level of the ocean, and are hence perpetually deſalited by the rivers which run through them; which is not the caſe with the Mediterranean, into which a current from the main ocean perpetually paſſes.</p>

This is one of the American fruits, which are annually thrown on the coaſts of Norway; and are frequently in ſo recent a ſtate as to vegetate, when properly taken care of, the fruit of the anacardium, caſhew-nut; of cucurbita lagenaria, bottlegourd; of the mimoſa ſeandens, cocoons; of the piſcidia crythrina, logwood-tree; and cocoa-nuts are enumerated by Dr. Tonning. (Amaen. Acad. 149.) amongſt these emigrant ſeeds. The fact is truly wonderful, and cannot be accounted for but by the exiſtence of under currents in the depths of the ocean; or from vortexes of water paſſing from one country to another through caverns of the earth.</p>
                           <p>Sir Hans Sloane has given an account of four kinds of ſeeds, which are frequently thrown by the ſea upon the coaſts of the iſlands of the northern parts of Scotland. Phil. Tranſ. abridged, Vol. III. p. 540. which ſeeds are natives of the West Indies, and ſeem to be brought thither by the gulf-ſtream deſerbed below. One of theſe is called, by Sir H. Sloane, Phaſeolus maximus perennis, which is often alſo thrown on the coaſt of Kerry in Ireland; another is called, in Jamaica, Horſe-eye-bean; and a third is called Niker in Jamaica. He adds, that the Lenticula marina, or Sargoſſo, grows on the rocks about Jamaica, is carried by the winds and current towards the coaſt of Florida, and thence into the North-American ocean, where it lies very thick on the ſurface of the ſea.</p>
                           <p>Thus a rapid current paſſes from the gulf of Florida to the N. E. along the coaſt of North-America, known to ſeamen by the name of the GULF-STREAM. A chart of this was publiſhed by Dr. Francklin in 1768, from the information principally of Capt. Folger. This was confirmed by the ingenious experiments of Dr. Blagden, published in 1781, who found that the water of the Gulf-ſtream was from ſix to eleven degrees warmer than the water of the ſea through which it ran; which muſt have been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by its being brought from a hotter climate. He aſcribes the origin of this current to the power of the trade-winds, which, blowing always in the ſame direction, carry the waters of the Atlantic ocean to the weſtward, till they are ſtopped by the oppoſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent on the weſt of the Gulf of Mexico, and are thus accumulated there, and run down the Gulf of Florida. Philoſ. Tranſ. V. 71, p. 335. Governor Pownal has given an elegant map of this Gulf-ſtream, tracing it from the Gulf of Florida north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as ſar as Cape Sable in Nova Scotia, and then acroſs the Atlantic ocean to the coaſt of Africa between the Canary-iſlands and Senegal, increasing in breadth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it runs, till it occupies five or ſix degrees of latitude. The Governer likewiſe aſcribes this current to the force of the trade-winds <hi>protruding</hi> the waters weſtward, till they are oppoſed by the continent, and accumulated in the Gulf of Mexico. He very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerves, that a great eddy muſt be produced in the Atlantic ocean between this Gulf-stream and the weſterly current protruded by the tropical winds, and in this eddy are found the immenſe fields of floating vegetables, called Saragoſa weeds, and Gulf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeds, and ſome light woods, which circulate in theſe vaſt eddies, or are occaſionally driven out of them by the winds. Hydraulic and Nautical Obſervations by Governor Pownal, 1787. Other currents are mentioned by the Governor in this ingeniou work, as thoſe in the Indian Sea, northward of the line, which are aſcribed to the influence of the Monſoons. It is probable, that in proceſs of time the narrow tract of land on the weſt of the Gulf of Mexico may be worn away by this elevation of water daſhing againſt it, by which this immenſe current would ceaſe to exiſt, and a wonderful change take place in the Gulf of Mexico and Weſt Indian iſlands, by the ſubſiding of the ſea, which might probably lay all thoſe iſlands into one, or join them to the continent.</p>

                     <p>POETRY has been called a ſiſter-art both to Painting and to Muſic; I wiſh to know, what are the
particulars of their relationſhip?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Poet.</speaker>
                     <p>It has been already obſerved, that the principal part of the
language of poetry conſiſts of thoſe words, which are expreſſive of
the ideas, which we originally receive by the organ of ſight; and
in this it nearly indeed reſembles painting; which can expreſs itſelf
in no other way, but by exciting the ideas or ſenſations belonging
to the ſenſe of viſion. But beſides this eſſential ſimilitude in the
language of the poetic pen and pencil, theſe two ſiſters reſemble
each other, if I may ſo ſay, in many of their habits and manners.
The painter, to produce a ſtrong effect, makes a few parts of his
picture large, diſtinct, and luminous, and keeps the remainder in
ſhadow, or even beneath its natural ſize and colour, to give emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
to the principal figure. This is ſimilar to the common
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0811300400:515"/>
manner of poetic compoſition, where the ſubordinate characters are
kept down, to elevate and give conſequence to the hero or heroine
of the piece.</p>
                     <p>In the ſouth aile of the cathedral church at Lichfield, there is an
antient monument of a recumbent figure; the head and neck of
which lie on a roll of matting in a kind of niche or cavern in the
wall; and about five feet diſtant horizontally in another opening or
cavern in the wall are ſeen the feet and ankles, with ſome folds of
garment, lying alſo on a matt; and though the intermediate ſpace is
a ſolid ſtone-wall, yet the imagination ſupplies the deficiency, and
the whole figure ſeems to exiſt before our eyes. Does not this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
one of the arts both of the painter and the poet? The former
often ſhows a mulcular arm amidſt a group of figures, or an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſioned
face; and, hiding the remainder of the body behind other
objects, leaves the imagination to compleat it. The latter, deſcribing
a ſingle feature or attitude in pictureſque words, produces before the
mind an image of the whole.</p>
                     <p>I remember ſeeing a print, in which was repreſented a ſhrivelled
hand ſtretched through an iron grate, in the ſtone floor of a priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
to reach at a meſs of porrage, which affected me with more
horrid ideas of the diſtreſs of the priſoner in the dungeon below,
than could have been perhaps produced by an exhibition of the
whole perſon. And in the following beautiful ſcenery from the
Midſummer-night's dream, (in which I have taken the liberty to
alter the place of a comma), the deſcription of the ſwimming ſtep and
prominent belly bring the whole figure before our eyes with the
diſtinctneſs of reality.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>When we have laugh'd to ſee the ſails conceive,</l>
                        <l>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</l>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0811300400:516"/>
                        <l>Which ſhe with pretty and with ſwimming gate,</l>
                        <l>Following her womb, (then rich with my young ſquire),</l>
                        <l>Would imitate, and ſail upon the land.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>There is a third ſiſter-feature, which belongs both to the pictorial
and poetic art; and that is the making ſentiments and paſſions viſible,
as it were, to the ſpectator; this is done in both arts by deſcribing
or portraying the effects or changes which thoſe ſentiments or
paſſions produce upon the body. At the end of the unaltered play
of Lear, there is a beautiful example of poetic painting; the old
King is introduced as dying from grief for the loſs of Cordelia;
at this criſis, Shakeſpear, conceiving the robe of the king to be held
together by a claſp, repreſents him as only ſaying to an attendant
courtier in a faint voice, "Pray, Sir, undo this button,—thank you,
Sir," and dies. Thus by the art of the poet, the oppreſſion at the
boſom of the dying King is made viſible, not deſcribed in words.</p>

                     <p>What are the features, in which theſe Siſter-arts do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
each other?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>The ingenious Biſhop Berkeley, in his Treatiſe on Viſion, a
work of great ability, has evinced, that the colours, which we ſee,
are only a language ſuggeſting to our minds the ideas of ſolidity and
extenſion, which we had before received by the ſenſe of touch.
Thus when we view the trunk of a tree, our eye can only acquaint
us with the colours or ſhades; and from the previous experience of
the ſenſe of touch, theſe ſuggeſt to us the cylindrical form, with the
prominent or depreſſed wrinkles on it. From hence it appears, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0811300400:517"/>
there is the ſtricteſt analogy between colours and ſounds; as they
are both but languages, which do not repreſent their correſpondent
ideas, but only ſuggeſt them to the mind from the habits or aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
of previous experience. It is therefore reaſonable to conclude,
that the more artificial arrangements of theſe two languages by the
poet and the painter bear a ſimilar analogy.</p>
                     <p>But in one circumſtance the Pen and the Pencil differ widely from
each other, and that is the quantity of Time which they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in their reſpective repreſentations. The former can unravel a
long ſeries of events, which may conſtitute the hiſtory of days or
years; while the latter can exhibit only the actions of a moment.
The Poet is happier in deſcribing ſucceſſive ſcenes; the Painter in
repreſenting ſtationary ones: both have their advantages.</p>
                     <p>Where the paſſions are introduced, as the Poet, on one hand, has
the power gradually to prepare the mind of his reader by previous
climacteric circumstances; the Painter, on the other hand, can throw
ſtronger illumination and diſtinctneſs on the principal moment or
catastrophe of the action; beſides the advantage he has in uſing an
univerſal language, which can be <hi>read</hi> in an inſtant of time. Thus
where a great number of figures are all ſeen together, ſupporting or
contraſting each other, and contributing to explain or aggrandize
the principal effect, we view a picture with agreeable ſurprize, and
contemplate it with unceaſing admiration. In the repreſentation of
the ſacrifice of Jephtha's Daughter, a print done from a painting of
Ant. Coypel, at one glance of the eye we read all the intereſting
paſſages of the laſt act of a well-written tragedy; ſo much poetry is
there condenſed into a moment of time.</p>

                     <p>Will you now oblige me with an account of the relationſhip
between Poetry, and her other ſiſter, Muſic?</p>

                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>In the poetry of our language I don't think we are to look for
any thing analogous to the notes of the gamut; for, except perhaps
in a few exclamations or interrogations, we are at liberty to raiſe
or ſink our voice an octave or two at pleaſure, without altering the
ſenſe of the words. Hence, if either poetry or proſe be read in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious
tones of voice, as is done in recitativo, or in chaunting, it
muſt depend on the ſpeaker, not on the writer: for though words
may be ſelected which are leſs harſh than others, that is, which
have fewer ſudden ſtops or abrupt conſonants amongſt the vowels,
or with fewer ſibilant letters, yet this does not conſtitute melody,
which conſiſts of agreeable ſucceſſions of notes referrable to the
gamut; or harmony, which conſiſts of agreeable combinations of
them. If the Chineſe language has many words of ſimilar articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which yet signify different ideas, when ſpoken in a higher or
lower muſical note, as ſome travellers affirm, it muſt be capable of
much finer effect, in reſpect to the audible part of poetry, than any
language we are acquainted with.</p>
                     <p>There is however another affinity, in which poetry and muſic
more nearly reſemble each other than has generally been underſtood,
and that is in their meaſure or time. There are but two kinds
of time acknowledged in modern muſic, which are called <hi>triple
time,</hi> and <hi>common time.</hi> The former of theſe is divided by bars,
each bar containing three crotchets, or a proportional number of
their ſubdiviſions into quavers and ſemiquavers. This kind of time
is analogous to the meaſure of our heroic or iambic verſe. Thus the
two following couplets are each of them divided into five bars
of <hi>triple time,</hi> each bar conſiſting of two crotchets and two quavers;
nor can they be divided into bars analogous to <hi>common time</hi> without
the bars interfering with ſome of the crotchets, ſo as to divide them.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>3/4 Soft-warbling beaks | in each bright bloſ | ſom move,</l>

                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0811300400:519"/>
In theſe lines there is a quaver and a crochet alternately in every
bar, except in the laſt, in which <hi>the in</hi> make two ſemiquavers; the <hi>e</hi>
is ſuppoſed by Grammarians to be cut off, which any one's ear will
readily determine not to be true.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>3/4 Life buds or breathes | from Indus to | the poles,</l>

                     </q>
                     <p>In theſe lines there is a quaver and a crotchet alternately in the
ſirſt bar; a quaver, two crotchets, and a quaver, make the ſecond bar.
In the third bar there is a quaver, a crotchet, and a reſt after the
crotchet, that is, after the word <hi>poles,</hi> and two quavers begin the
next line. The fourth bar conſiſts of quavers and crotchets alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately.
In the laſt bar there is a quaver, and a reſt after it, viz.
after the word <hi>kindles;</hi> and then two quavers and a crotchet. You
will clearly perceive the truth of this, if you prick the muſical cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
above mentioned under the verſes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>common time</hi> of muſicians is divided into bars, each of which
contains four crotchets, or a proportional number of their ſubdiviſion
into quavers and ſemiquavers. This kind of muſical time is analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous
to the dactyle verſes of our language, the moſt popular inſtances
of which are in Mr. Anſtie's Bath-Guide. In this kind of verſe the
bar does not begin till after the firſt or ſecond ſyllable; and where
the verſe is quite complete, and written by a good ear, theſe firſt ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables
added to the laſt complete the bar, exactly in this alſo corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding
with many pieces of muſic;

                           <l>For it | took up the barber a | whole afternoon.</l>

                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0811300400:520"/>
In theſe lines each bar conſiſts of a crotchet, two quavers, another
crotchet, and two more quavers: which are equal to four crotchets,
and, like many bars of <hi>common time</hi> in muſic, may be ſubdivided into
two in beating time without diſturbing the meaſure.</p>
                     <p>The following verſes from Shenſtone belong likewiſe to common
time:
<q>
                           <l>2/4 A | river or a ſea |</l>
                           <l>Was to him a diſh | of tea,</l>
                           <l>And a king | dom bread and butter.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt and ſecond bars conſiſt each of a crotchet, a quaver, a
crotchet, a quaver, a crotchet. The third bar conſiſts of a quaver,
two crotchets, a quaver, a crotchet. The laſt bar is not complete
without adding the letter A, which begins the firſt line, and then it
conſiſts of a quaver, a crotchet, a quaver, a crotchet, two quavers.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be obſerved, that the crotchets in triple time are in general
played by muſicians slower than thoſe of common time, and hence
minuets are generally pricked in triple time, and country dances ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
in common time. So the verſes above related, which are
analogous to <hi>triple time,</hi> are generally read ſlower than thoſe analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous
to <hi>common time;</hi> and are thence generally uſed for graver com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
I ſuppoſe all the different kinds of verſes to be found in
our odes, which have any meaſure at all, might be arranged <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

ſometimes to precede the commencement of the bar, and occaſional
reſts, as in muſical compoſitions: if this was attended to by thoſe
who ſet poetry to muſic, it is probable the ſound and ſenſe would
oftener coincide. Whether theſe muſical times can be applied to the
lyric and heroic verſes of the Greek and Latin poets, I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to determine; certain it is, that the dactyle verſe of our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
when it is ended with a double rhime, much reſembles the
meaſure of Homer and Virgil, except in the length of the lines.</p>

Sir Iſaac Newton has obſerved, that the breadths of the ſeven primary
colours in the Sun's image refracted by a priſm are proportional to
the ſeven muſical notes of the gamut, or to the intervals of the eight
ſounds contained in an octave, that is, proportional to the following
numbers:

                     <p>Newton's Optics, Book I, part 2. prop. 3 and 6. Dr. Smith, in his
Harmonics, has an explanatory note upon this happy diſcovery, as he
terms it, of Newton. Sect. 4. Art. 7.</p>
                     <p>From this curious coincidence, it has been propoſed to produce a
luminous muſic, conſiſting of ſucceſſions or combinations of colours,
analogous to a tune in respect to the proportions above mentioned.
This might be performed by a ſtrong light, made by means of Mr.
Argand's lamps, paſſing through coloured glaſſes, and falling on
a defined part of a wall, with moveable blinds before them, which
might communicate with the keys of a harpſichord; and thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
at the ſame time viſible and audible muſic in uniſon with each
other.</p>
                     <p>The execution of this idea is ſaid by Mr. Guyot to have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by Father Caffel without much ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0811300400:522"/>
If this ſhould be again attempted, there is another curious coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
between ſounds and colours, diſcovered by Dr. Darwin of
Shrewſbury, and explained in a paper on what he calls <hi>Ocular Spectra,</hi>
in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, Vol. LXXVI. which might much
facilitate the execution of it. In this treatiſe the Doctor has demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated,
that we ſee certain colours, not only with greater eaſe and
diſtinctneſs, but with relief and pleaſure, after having for ſome time
contemplated other certain colours; as green after red, or red after
green; orange after blue, or blue after orange; yellow after violet,
or violet after yellow. This he ſhews ariſes from the <hi>ocular ſpectrum</hi>
of the colour laſt viewed coinciding with the <hi>irritation</hi> of the colour
now under contemplation. Now as the pleaſure we receive from
the ſenſation of melodious notes, independent of the previous aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations
of agreeable ideas with them, muſt ariſe from our hearing
ſome proportions of ſounds after others more eaſily, diſtinctly, or
agreeably; and as there is a coincidence between the proportions of
the primary colours, and the primary ſounds, if they may be ſo
called; he argues, that the ſame laws muſt govern the ſenſations of
both. In this circumſtance, therefore, conſiſts the ſiſterhood of Muſic
and Painting; and hence they claim a right to borrow metaphors
from each other; muſicians to ſpeak of the brilliancy of ſounds,
and the light and ſhade of a concerto; and painters of the harmony
of colours, and the tone of a picture. Thus it was not quite ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,
as was imagined, when the blind man aſked if the colour
ſcarlet was like the ſound of a trumpet. As the coincidence or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of theſe <hi>ocular ſpectra,</hi> (or colours which remain in the eye
after having for ſome time contemplated a luminous object) are
more eaſily and more accurately aſcertained, now their laws have
been inveſtigated by Dr. Darwin, than the <hi>relicts</hi> of evaneſcent ſounds
upon the ear; it is to be wiſhed that ſome ingenious muſician would
further cultivate this curious field of ſcience: for if visible muſic
can be agreeably produced, it would be more eaſy to add ſentiment
to it by the repreſentations of groves and Cupids, and ſleeping
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0811300400:523"/>
nymphs amid the changing colours, than is commonly done by the
words of audible muſic.</p>

                     <p>You mentioned the greater length of the verſes of Homer and
Virgil. Had not theſe poets great advantage in the ſuperiority of
their languages compared to our own?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>It is probable, that the introduction of philoſophy into a
country muſt gradually affect the language of it; as philoſophy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes
in more appropriated and abſtracted terms; and thus by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
eradicates the abundance of metaphor, which is uſed in the
more early ages of ſociety. Otherwiſe, though the Greek compound
words have more vowels in proportion to their conſonants than the
Engliſh ones, yet the modes of compounding them are leſs general;
as may be ſeen by variety of inſtances given in the preface of the
Tranſlators, prefixed to the SYSTEM OF VEGETABLES by the Lich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field
Society; which happy property of our own language rendered
that tranſlation of Linneus as expreſſive and as conciſe, perhaps more
ſo than the original.</p>
                     <p>And in one reſpect, I believe, the Engiſh language ſerves the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of poetry better than the antient ones, I mean in the greater
eaſe of producing perſonifications; for as our nouns have in general
no genders affixed to them in proſe-compoſitions, and in the habits
of converſation, they become eaſily perſonified only by the addition
of a maſculine or feminine pronoun, as,
<q>
                           <l>Pale Melancholy ſits, and round <hi>her</hi> throws</l>
                           <l>A death-like ſilence, and a dread repoſe.</l>
                           <bibl>Pope's Abelard.</bibl>
                        </q>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0811300400:524"/>
And ſecondly, as moſt of our nouns have the article <hi>a</hi> or <hi>the</hi> prefixed
to them in proſe-writing and in converſation, they in general become
perſoniſied even by the omiſſion of theſe articles; as in the bold
figure of Shipwreck in Miſs Seward's Elegy on Capt. Cook:
<q>
                           <l>But round the ſteepy rocks and dangerous ſtrand</l>
                           <l>Rolls the white ſurf, and SHIPWRECK guards the land.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Add to this, that if the verſes in our heroic poetry be ſhorter than
thoſe of the ancients, our words likewiſe are ſhorter; and in reſpect
to their meaſure or time, which has erroneouſly been called melody
and harmony, I doubt, from what has been ſaid above, whether we
are ſo much inferior as is generally believed;ſince many paſſages,
which have been ſtolen from antient poets, have been tranſlated into
our language without loſing any thing of the beauty of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification.</p>

epithets, phraſes, and even half a line occaſionally from modern

                     <p>It may be difficult to mark the exact boundary of what ſhould
be termed plagiariſm: where the ſentiment and expreſſion are both
borrowed without due acknowledgement, there can be no doubt;—
ſingle words, on the contrary, taken from other authors, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict
a writer of plagiariſm; they are lawful game, wild by nature,
the property of all who can capture them;—and perhaps a few
common flowers of ſpeech may be gathered, as we paſs over our
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0811300400:525"/>
neighbour's incloſure, without ſtigmatizing us with the title of
thieves; but we muſt not therefore plunder his cultivated fruit.</p>
                     <p>The four lines at the end of the plant Upas are imitated from Dr.
Young's Night Thoughts. The line in the epiſode adjoined to Caſſia,
"The ſalt tear mingling with the milk he ſips," is from an intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and humane paſſage in Langhorne's Juſtice of Peace. There are
probably many others, which, if I could recollect them, ſhould here
be acknowledged. As it is, like exotic plants, their mixture with
the natives ones, I hope, adds beauty to my Botanic Garden:—and
ſuch as it is, <hi>Mr. Bookſeller,</hi> I now leave it to you to deſire the Ladies
and Gentlemen to walk in; but pleaſe to apprize them, that, like
the ſpectators at an unſkilful exhibition in ſome village-barn, I hope

It expands a most exquiſitely beautiful corol, and emits a moſt fragrant odour for a few hours in the night, and then cloſes to open no more. The flower is nearly a foot in diameter; the inſide of the calyx of a ſplendid yellow, and the numerous petals of a pure white: it begins to open about ſeven or eight o'clock in the evening, and clſoſes before ſun-riſe in the morning. Martyn's Letters, p. 294. The Ciſtus labdiniferus, and many other flowers, loſe their petals after having been a few hours expanded in the day-time; for in theſe plants the ſtigma is ſoon impregnated by the numerous anthers: in many flowers of the Ciſtus lubdiniferus I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved two or three of the ſtamens were perpetually bent into contact with the piſtil.</p>
                           <p>The Nyctanthes, called Arabian Jaſmine, is another flower, which expands a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful corol, and gives out a moſt delicate perfume during the night, and not in the day, in its native country, whence its name; botanical philoſophers have not yet explained this wonderful property; perhaps the plant ſleeps during the day as ſome animals do; and its odoriferous glands only emit their fragrance during the expanſion of the petals; that is, during its waking hours: the Geranium triſle has the ſame property of giving up its fragrance only in the night. The flowers of the Cucurbita lagenaria are ſaid to cloſe when the ſun ſhines upon them. In our climate many flowers, as tragopogon, and hibiſcus, cloſe their flowers before the hotteſt part of the day comes on; and the flowers of ſome ſpecies of cucubalus, and Silene, viſcous campion, are cloſed all day; but when the ſun leaves them they expand, and emit a very agreeable ſcent; whence ſuch plants are termed noctiflora.</p>

Linneus firſt obſerved the Tropaeolum Majus to emit ſparks or ſlaſhes in the mornings before ſun-riſe, during the months of June or July, and alſo during the twilight in the evening, but not after total darkneſs came on; theſe ſingular ſcintillations were ſhewn to her father and other philoſophers; and Mr. Wilcke, a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated electrician, believed them to be electric. Lin. Spec. Plantar. p. 490. Swediſh Acts for the year 1762. Pulteney's View of Linncus, p. 220. Nor is this more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful than that the electric eel and torpedo ſhould give voluntary ſhocks of electricity; and in this plant perhaps, as in thoſe animals, it may be a mode of defence, by which it harraſſes or deſtroys the night-flying inſects which infeſt it; and probably it may emit the ſame ſparks during the day, which muſt be then inviſible. This curious ſubject deſerves further inveſtigation. See Dictamnus. The ceaſing to ſhine of this plant after twilight might induce one to conceive, that it abſorbed and emitted light, like the Bolognian Phoſphorus, or calcined oyſter-ſhells, ſo well explained by Mr. B. Wilſon, and by T. B. Beccari. Exper. on Phoſphori, by B. Wilſon. Dodſley. The light of the evening, at the ſame diſtance from noon, is much greater, as I have repeatedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, than the light of the morning: this is owing, I ſuppoſe, to the phoſphoreſcent quality of almoſt all bodies, in a greater or leſs degree, which thus abſorb light during the ſun-ſhine, and continue to emit it again for ſome time afterwards, though not in ſuch quantity as to produce apparent ſcintillations. The nectary of this plant grows from what is ſuppoſed to be the calyx; but this ſuppoſed calyx is coloured; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, from this circumſtance of its bearing the nectary, ſhould rather be eſteemed a part of the coral.

The numerous families of graſſes have all three males, and two females, except Anthoxanthum, which gives the grateful ſmell to hay, and has but two males. The herbs of this order of vegetables ſupport the countleſs tribes of gramini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorous animals. The ſeeds of the ſmaller kinds of graſſes, as of aira, poa, briza, ſtipa, &amp;c. are the ſuſtenance of many ſorts of birds.

                           <p>It ſeems to have required more ingenuity to think of ſeeding nations of mankind with ſo ſmall a ſeed, than with the potatoe of Mexico, or the bread-fruit of the ſouthern iſlands; hence Ceres in Egypt, which was the birth-place of our European arts, was deſervedly celebrated amongſt their divinities, as well as Oſyris, who invented the Plough.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Wahlborn obſerves, that as wheat, rye, and many of the graſſes, and plantain, lift up their anthers on long filments, and thus expoſe the encloſed fecundating duſt to be waſhed away by the rains, a ſcarcity of corn is produced by wet ſummers; hence the neceſſity of a careful choice of ſeed-wheat, as that, which had not received the duſt of the anthers, will not grow, though it may appear well to the eye. The ſtraw of the oat ſeems to have been the firſt muſical inſtrument, invented during the paſtoral ages of the world, before the diſcovery of metals. See note on Ciſtus.</p>

                           <p>Some ſnowdrop-roots taken up in winter, and boiled, had the inſipid mucilaginous taſte of the Orchis, and, if cured in the ſame manner, would probably make as good ſalep.

                           <p>The difficulty of raiſing the Orchis from ſeed has, perhaps, been a principal reaſon of its not being cultivated in this country as an article of food.

The arguments which tend to ſhew that the warm ſprings of this country are produced from ſteam raiſed by deep ſubterraneous fires, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards condenſed between the ſtrata of the mountains, appear to me much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, than the idea of their being warmed by chemical combinations near the ſurface of the earth: for, 1ſt, their heat has kept accurately the ſame perhaps for many centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, certainly as long as we have been poſſeſſed of good thermometers; which cannot be well explained, without ſuppoſing that they are firſt in a boiling ſtate. For as the heat of boiling water is 212, and that of the internal parts of the earth 48, it is eaſy to underſtand, that the ſteam raiſed from boiling water, after being condenſed in ſome mountain, and paſſing from thence through a certain ſpace of the cold earth, muſt be cooled always to a given degree; and it is probable the diſtance from the exit of the ſpring, to the place where the ſteam is condenſed, might be gueſſed by the degree of its warmth.</p>
                           <p>2. In the dry ſummer of 1780, when all other ſprings were either dry or much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, thoſe of Buxton and Matlock (as I was well informed on the ſpot), had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no diminution; which proves that the ſources of theſe warm ſprings are at great depths below the ſurface of the earth.</p>
                           <p>3. There are numerous perpendicular fiſſures in the rocks of Derbyſhire, in which the ores of lead and copper are found, and which paſs to unknown depths; and might thence afford a paſſage to ſteam from great ſubterraneous fires.</p>
                           <p>4. If theſe waters were heated by the decompoſition of pyrites, there would be ſome chalybeate taſte or ſulphureous ſmell in them. See note in part I. on the exiſtence of central fires.</p>

Dr. Prieſtley found that great quantities of pure dephlogiſticated air were given up in water at the points of this vegetable, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the ſunſhine, and that hence it contributed to preſerve the water in reſervoirs from becoming putrid. The minute diviſions of the leaves of ſubaquatic plants, as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the note on Trapa, and of the gills of fiſh, ſeem to ſerve another purpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that of increaſing their ſurface, which has not, I believe, been attended to, and that is to facilitate the ſeparation of the air, which is mechanically mixed or chemically diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in water by their points or edges; this appears on immerſing a dry hairy leaf in water freſh from a pump; innumerable globules like quickſilver appear on almoſt every point; for the extremities of theſe points attract the particles of water leſs forcibly than thoſe particles attract each other; hence the contained air, whoſe elaſticity was but juſt balanced by the attractive power of the ſurrounding particles of water to each other, finds at the point of each fibre a place where the reſiſtance to its expanſion is leſs; and in conſequence it there expands, and becomes a bubble of air. It is eaſy to foreſee that the rays of the ſunſhine, by being refracted and in part reflected by the two ſurfaces of theſe minute air-bubbles, muſt impart to them much more heat than to the tranſparent water; and thus facilitate their aſcent by further expanding them; that the points of vegetables attract the particles of water leſs than they attract each other, is ſeen by the ſpherical form of dew-drops on the points of graſs.

The lower leaves of this plant grow under water, and are divided into minute capillary ramifications; while the upper leaves are broad and round, and have air-bladders in their footſtalks to ſupport them above the ſurface of the water. As the aërial leaves of vegetables do the office of lungs, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a large ſurface of veſſels with their contained fluids to the influence of the air; ſo theſe aquatic leaves anſwer a ſimilar purpoſe like the gills of fiſh; and perhaps gain from water or give to it a ſimilar material. As the material thus neceſſary to life ſeems to abound more in air than in water, the ſubaquatic leaves of this plant, and of ſiſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium, coenanthe, ranunculus aquatilis, water crowfoot, and ſome others, are cut into fine diviſions to increaſe the ſurface; whilſt thoſe above water are undivided. So the plants on high mountains have their upper leaves more divided, as pimpinella, petroſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linum, and others, becauſe here the air is thinner, and thence a larger ſurface of contact is required. The ſtream of water alſo paſſes but once along the gills of fiſh, as it is ſooner deprived of its virtue; whereas the air is both received and ejected by the action of the lungs of land-animals. The whale ſeems to be an exception to the above, as he receives water and ſpouts it out again from an organ, which I ſuppoſe to be a reſpiratory one. As ſpring-water is nearly of the ſame degree of heat in all climates, the aquatic plants, which grow in rills or fountains, are found equally in the torrid, temperate, and frigid zones, as water-creſs, water-parſnip, ranunculus, and many others.</p>
                           <p>In warmer climates the watery grounds are uſefully cultivated, as with rice; and the roots of ſome aquatic plants are ſaid to have ſupplied food, as the antient Lotus in Egypt, which ſome have ſuppoſed to be the Nymphaea.—In Siberia the roots of the Butomus, or flowering ruſh, are eaten, which is well worth further enquiry, as they grow ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in our ditches and rivers, which at preſent produce no eſculent vegetables; and might thence become an article of uſeful cultivation. Herodotus affirms, that the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Lotos grows in the Nile, and reſembles a Lily. That the natives dry it in the ſun, and take the pulp out of it, which grows like the head of a poppy, and bake it for bread. Enterpe. Many grit-ſtones and coals, which I have ſeen, ſeem to bear an impreſſion of the roots of the Nymphaea, which are often three or four inches thick, especially the white-flowered one.</p>

It ſeems to be the immediate cauſe of the ſea ſcurvy, as thoſe patients quickly recover by the uſe of freſh proviſions; and is probably a remote cauſe of ſcrophula (which conſiſts in the want of irritability in the abſorbent veſſels), and is therefore ſerviceable to theſe patients; as wine is neceſſary to thoſe whoſe ſtomachs have been weakened by its uſe. The univerſality of the uſe of ſalt with our food, and in our cookery, has rendered it difficult to prove the truth of theſe obſervations. I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that fleſh-meat cut into thin ſlices, either raw or boiled, might be preſerved in coarſe ſugar or treacle; and thus a very nouriſhing and ſalutary diet might be preſented to our ſeamen.

If a perſon unaccuſtomed to much ſalt ſhould eat a couple of red-herrings, his inſenſible perſpiration will be ſo much increaſed by the ſtimulus of the ſalt, that he will find it neceſſary in about two hours to drink a quart of water: the effects of a continued uſe of ſalt in weakening the action of the lymphatic ſyſtem may hence be deduced.</p>

The piſtil, or female part of the flower, riſes like a club, is covered above or clothed, as it were, by the anthers or males; and ſome of the ſpecies have a large ſcarlet blotch in the middle of every leaf.</p>
                           <p>The ſingular and wonderful ſtructure of this flower has occaſioned many diſputes amongſt botaniſts. See Tourniff. Malpig. Dillen. Rivin. &amp;c. The receptacle is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged into a naked club, with the germs at its baſe; the ſtamens are affixed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle amidſt the germs (a natural prodigy), and thus do not need the aſſiſtance of elevating filaments: hence the flower may be ſaid to be inverted. <hi>Families of Plants</hi> tranſlated from Linneus, p. 618.</p>
                           <p>The ſpadix of this plant is frequently quite white, or coloured, and the leaves liable to be ſtreaked with white, and to have black or ſcarlet blotches on them. As the plant has no corol or bloſſom, it is probable the coloured juices in theſe parts of the ſheath or leaves may ſerve the ſame purpoſe as the coloured juices in the petals of other flowers; from which I ſuppoſe the honey to be prepared. See note on Helleborus. I am informed that thoſe tulip-roots which have a red cuticle produce red flowers. See Rubia.</p>
                           <p>When the petals of the tulip become ſtriped with many colours, the plant loſes almoſt half of its height; and the method of making them thus break into colours is by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplanting them into a meagre or ſandy ſoil, <hi>after they have previouſly enjoyed a richer ſoil:</hi> hence it appears, that the plant is weakened when the flower becomes variegated.

                              <hi>Dianthus.</hi> l. 299. Superbus. Proud Pink. There is a kind of pink called Fairchild's mule, which is here ſuppoſed to be produced between a Dianthus ſuperbus, and the Caryophyllus, Clove. The Dianthus ſuperbus emits a moſt fragrant odour, particularly at night. Vegetable mules ſupply an irrefragable argument in favour of the ſexual ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of botany. They are ſaid to be numerous; and, like the mules of the animal kingdom, not always to continue their ſpecies by ſeed. There is an account of a curious mule from the Antirrhinum linaria, Toad-flax, in the Amoenit. Academ. V. I. No. 3. and many hybrid plants deſcribed in No. 32. The Urtica alienata is an evergreen plant, which appears to be a nettle from the male flowers, and a Pellitory (Parietaria) from the female ones and the fruit; and is hence between both. Murray, Syſt. Veg. Amongſt the Engliſh indigenous plants, the veronica hybrida mule Speedwel is ſuppoſed to have originated from the officinal one; and the ſpiked one, and the Sibthorpia Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paea to have for its parents the golden ſaxifrage and marſh pennywort. Pulteney's View of Linneus, p. 250. Mr. Graberg, Mr. Schreber, and Mr. Ramſtrom, ſeem of opinion, that the internal ſtructure or parts of fructification in mule-plants reſemble the female parent; but that the habit or external ſtructure reſembles the male parent. See treatiſes under the above names in V. VI. Amaenit. Academic. The mule produced from a horſe and the aſs reſembles the horse externally with his ears, main, and tail; but with the nature or manners of an aſs: but the Hinnus, or creature produced from a male aſs, and a mare, reſembles the father externally in ſtature, aſh-colour, and the black croſs, but with the nature or manners of a horſe. The breed from Spaniſh rams and Swediſh ewes reſembled the Spaniſh ſheep in wool, ſtature, and external form; but was as hardy as the Swediſh ſheep; and the contrary of thoſe which were produced from Swediſh rams and Spaniſh ewes. The offspring from the male goat of Angora and the Swediſh female goat had long ſoft camel's hair; but that from the male Swediſh goat, and the female one of Angora, had no improvement of their wool. An Engliſh ram without horns, and a Swediſh horned ewe, produced ſheep without horns. Amoen. Academ. V. VI. p. 13.</p>

The Harmattan is a ſingular wind blowing from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts of Africa to the Atlantic ocean, ſometimes for a few hours, ſometimes for ſeveral days without regular periods. It is always attended with a fog or haze, ſo denſe as to render thoſe objects inviſible which are at the diſtance of a quarter of a mile; the ſun appears through it only about noon, and then of a dilute red, and very minute par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſubſide from the miſty air ſo as to make the graſs, and the ſkins of negroes appear whitiſh. The extreme dryneſs which attends this wind or fog, without dews, withers and quite dries the leaves of vegetables; and is ſaid of Dr. Lind at ſome ſeaſons to be fatal and malignant to mankind; probably after much preceding wet, when it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come loaded with the exhalations from putrid marſhes; at other ſeaſons it is ſaid to check epidemic diſeaſes, to cure fluxes, and to heal ulcers and cutaneous eruptions; which is probably effected by its yielding no moiſture to the mouths of the external abſorbent veſſels, by which the action of the other branches of the abſorbent ſyſtem is increaſed to ſupply the deficiency, <hi>Account of the Harmattan.

                           <p>The Rev. Mr. Sterling gives an account of a darkneſs for ſix or eight hours at Detroit in America, on the 19th of October, 1762, in which the ſun appeared as red as blood, and thrice its uſual ſize: ſome rain falling, covered white paper with dark drops, like ſulphur or dirt, which burnt like wet gunpowder, and the air had a very ſulphureous ſmell. He ſuppoſes this to have been emitted from ſome diſtant earthquake or volcano. Philoſ. Tranſ. V. LIII. p. 63.</p>
                           <p>In many circumſtances this wind ſeems much to reſemble the dry fog which covered moſt parts of Europe for many weeks in the ſummer of 1780, which has been ſuppoſed to have had a volcanic origin, as it ſucceeded the violent eruption of Mount Heela, and its neighbourhood. From the ſubſidence of a white powder, it ſeems probable that the Harmattan has a ſimilar origin, from the unexplored mountains of Africa. Nor is it improbable, that the epidemic coughs, which occaſionally traverſe immenſe tracts of country, may be the products of volcanic eruptions; nor impoſſible, that at ſome future time contagious miaſmata may be thus emitted from ſubterraneous furnaces, in ſuch abundance as to contaminate the whole atmoſphere, and depopulate the earth!</p>

E. winds, continued ſo much longer than uſual, that the large rivers became dry; and prodigious quantities of ſea-fiſh, dead and dying, were ſeen floating for leagues on the ſea, and driven on the beach by the tides. This was ſuppoſed to have been cauſed by the great evaporation, and the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of freſh water rivers having rendered the ſea too ſalt for its inhabitants. The ſeaſon then became ſo ſickly as to deſtroy great numbers of people, both foreigners and natives. Phil. Tranſ. V. LXXI. p. 384.</p>

Chundali Borrum is the name which the natives give to this plant; it is the Hedyſarum gyrans, or moving plant; its claſs is two brotherhoods, ten males. Its leaves are continually in ſpontaneous motion; ſome riſing and others falling; and others whirling circularly by twiſting their ſtems; this ſpontaneous movement of the leaves, when the air is quite ſtill and very warm, ſeems to be neceſſary to the plant, as perpetual reſpiration is to animal life. A more particular account, with a good print of the Hedyſarum gyrans is given by M. Brouſſonet in a paper on vegetable motions in the Hiſtoire de l'Academic des Sciences. Ann. 1784, p. 609.</p>
                           <p>There are many other inſtances of ſpontaneous movements of the parts of vegetables. In the Marchantia polymorpha ſome yellow wool proceeds from the flower-bearing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which moves ſpontaneouſly in the anther, while it drops its duſt like atoms. Murray, Syſt. Veg. See note on Collinſonia for other inſtances of vegetable ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneity. Add to this, that as the ſleep of animals conſiſts in a ſuſpenſion of voluntary motion, and as vegetables are likewiſe ſubject to ſleep, there is reaſon to conclude, that the various actions of opening and cloſing their petals and ſoliage may be juſtly aſcribed to a voluntary power: for without the faculty of volition, ſleep would not have been neceſſary to them.</p>

As theſe trees bear ſome male and others female flowers, immured on all ſides by the fruit, the manner of their fecundation was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible, till Tourneſort and Pontedera diſcovered, that a kind of gnat produced in the male figs carried the ſecundating duſt on its wings, (Cynips Pſenes Syſt. Nat. 919.), and, penetrating the female fig, thus impregnated the flowers; for the evidence of this wonderful fact, ſee the word Caprification, in Milne's Botanical Dictionary. The figs of this country are all female, and their ſeeds not prolific; and therefore they can only be propagated by layers and ſuckers.</p>
                           <p>Monsieur de la Hire has ſhewn in the Memoir. de l'Academ. de Science, that the ſummer figs of Paris, in Provence, Italy, and Malta, have all perfect ſtamina, and ripen not only their fruits, but their ſeed; from which ſeed other fig-trees are raiſed; but that the ſtamina of the autumnal figs are abortive, perhaps owing to the want of due warmth. Mr. Milne, in his Botanical Dictionary (art. Caprification), ſays, that the cultivated fig-trees have a few male flowers placed above the female within the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering or receptacle; which in warmer climates perform their proper office, but in colder ones become abortive. And Linneus obſerves, that ſome figs have the navel of the receptacle open; which was one reaſon that induced him to remove this plant from the claſs Clandeſtine Marriage to the claſs Polygamy. Lin. Spec. Plant.</p>
                           <p>From all theſe circumſtances I ſhould conjecture, that thoſe female fig-flowers, which are cloſed on all ſides in the fruit or receptacle without any male ones, are monſters, which have been propagated for their fruit, like barberries, and grapes without ſeeds in them; and that the Caprification is either an antient proceſs of imaginary uſe, and blindly followed in ſome countries, or that it may contribute to ripen the fig by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing its vigour, like cutting off a circle of the bark from the branch of a pear-tree. Tournefort ſeems inclined to this opinion; who ſays, that the figs in Provence and at Paris ripen ſooner, if their buds be pricked with a ſtraw dipped in olive-oil. Plumbs and pears punctured by ſome inſects ripen ſooner, and the part round the puncture is ſweeter. Is not the honey-dew produced by the puncture of inſects? will not wounding the branch of a pear-tree, which is too vigorous, prevent the bloſſoms from falling off; as from ſome fig-trees the fruit is ſaid to fall off unleſs they are wounded by caprification? I had laſt ſpring ſix young trees of the Iſchia fig with fruit on them in pots in a ſlove; on removing them into larger boxes, they protruded very vigorous ſhoots, and the fig all fell off; which I aſcribed to the increaſed vigour of the plants.</p>

It may ſeem a ſoleciſm in language, to call a flower, which contains many of both ſexes, an individual; and the more ſo to call a tree or ſhrub an individual, which conſiſts of ſo many flowers. Every tree, indeed, ought to be conſidered as a family or ſwarm of its reſpective buds; but the buds themſelves ſeem to be individual plants; because each has leaves or lungs appropriated to it; and the bark of the tree is only a congeries of the roots of all theſe individual buds. Thus hollow oak-trees and willows are often ſeen with the whole wood decayed and gone; and yet the few remaining branches flouriſh with vigour; but in reſpect to the male and female parts of a flower, they do not deſtroy its individuality any more than the number of paps of a ſow, or the number of her coty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledons, each of which includes one of her young.</p>

of the plant to produce more ſtamens, as would appear from ſome experiments of
M. Reynier, inſtituted for another purpoſe: he cut away the ſtamens of many flowers,
with deſign to prevent their ſecundity, and in many inſtances the flower threw out new
filaments from the wounded part of different lengths; but did not produce new anthers.
The experiments were made on the geum rivale, different kinds of mallows, and the
aechinops ritro. Critical Review for March, 1788.</p>

purple, with white edges and orange ſtreaks, creeping, as it were, into the mouth of the
flower like an inſect; by which deception in its native climate it probably prevents a
ſimilar inſect from plundering it of its honey: the edges of the lower petal lap over
thoſe of the upper one, which prevents it from opening too wide on fine days, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitates
its return at night; whence the rain is excluded, and the air admitted. See Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymorpha,

Aug. 20th, 1788; and on drawing a ſtraw along the middle of the rib of the
leaves as they lay upon the ground round the ſtem, each of them, in about a ſecond of

In the Apocynum Androſaemifolium, one kind of Dog's bane, the anthers converge
over the nectaries, which conſiſt of five glandular oval corpuſcles ſurrounding the germ;
and at the ſame time admit air to the nectaries at the interſtice between each anther.
But when a fly inserts its proboſcis between theſe anthers to plunder the honey, they
converge cloſer, and with ſuch violence as to detain the fly, which thus generally pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes.
This account was related to me by R. W. Darwin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Elſton, in
Nottinghamſhire, who ſhowed me the plant in flower, July 2d, 1788, with a fly thus
held faſt by the end of its proboſcis, and was well ſeen by a magnifying lens, and which
in vain repeatedly ſtruggled to diſengage itſelf, till the converging anthers were ſeparated
by means of a pin: on ſome days he had obſerved that almoſt every flower of this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
plant had a fly in it thus entangled; and a few weeks afterwards favoured me with
his further obſervations on this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>My Apocynum is not yet out of flower. I have often viſited it, and have frequently
found four or five flies, ſome alive, and ſome dead, in its flowers; they are generally
caught by the trunk or proboſcis, ſometimes by the trunk and a leg; there is one at
preſent only caught by a leg: I don't know that this plant ſleeps, as the flowers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
open in the night; yet the flies frequently make their eſcape. In a plant of
Mr. Ordino's, an ingenious gardener at Newark, who is poſſeſſed of a great collection
of plants, I ſaw many flowers of an Apocynum with three dead flies in each; they
are a thin-bodied fly, and rather leſs than the common houſe-fly; but I have ſeen two
or three other ſorts of flies thus arreſted by the plant. Aug. 12, 1788.</q>

the lower branches being conſtantly cropped by them, and thus ſhoot forth more luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant

contained in the cavities of the bambou. The ſtems of theſe canes were from 40 to 50
feet in height, and 4 or 5 inches in diameter, and might contain about 30 pints of
elaſtic air. He cut a bambou, and introduced a lighted candle into the cavity, which
was extinguished immediately on its entrance. He tried this about 60 times in a cavity
of the bambou, containing about two pints. He introduced mice at different times into
theſe cavities, which ſeemed to be ſomewhat affected, but ſoon recovered their agility.
The ſtem of the bambou is not hollow till it riſes more than one foot from the earth;
the diviſions between the cavities are convex downwards. Obſerv. ſur la Physique par

One evening he perceived a faint flaſh of light repeatedly dart from a Marigold; ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
at ſuch an uncommon appearance, he reſolved to examine it with attention; and,
to be aſſured that it was no deception of the eye, he placed a man near him, with orders
to make a signal at the moment when he obſerved the light. They both ſaw it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly

                  <p>The light was moſt brilliant on Marigolds, of an orange or flame colour; but ſcarcely

                  <p>1. The Marigold, (<hi>Calendula Officinalis</hi>).</p>
                  <p>2. Garden Naſturtion, (Tropaeolum majus).</p>
                  <p>3. Orange Lily, (Lilium bulbiferum).</p>
                  <p>4. The Indian Pink, (Tagetes patula et crecta).</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it was alſo obſerved on the Sun-flowers, (H linthus annuus). But bright
yellow, or flame colour, ſeemed in general neceſſary for the production of this light; for
it was never ſeen on the flowers of any other colour.</p>
                  <p>To diſcover whether ſome little inſects, or phoſphoric worms, might not be the cause
of it, the flowers were carefully examined even with a microſcope, without any ſuch
being ſound.</p>
                  <p>From the rapidity of the flaſh, and other circumſtances, it might be conjectured, that
there is ſomething of electricity in this phaenomenon. It is well known, that when the

may be combined. But M. Haggren, after having obſerved the flaſh from the
Orange-lily, the <hi>anthers</hi> of which are a conſiderable ſpace diſtant from the <hi>petals,</hi> found
that the light proceeded from the <hi>petals</hi> only; whence he concludes, that this electric
light is caused by the <hi>pollen,</hi> which in flying off is ſcattered upon the <hi>petals.</hi> Obſer.

                     <head>Deſcription of the Poiſon-Tree in the Iſland of JAVA. Tranſlated from the original Dutch
of N. P. Foerſch.</head>
                     <p>THIS deſtructive tree is called in the Malayan language <hi>Bohon-Upas,</hi> and has been
deſcribed by naturaliſts; but their accounts have been ſo tinctured with the <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellou,</hi>
that the whole narration has been ſuppoſed to be an ingenious fiction by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of readers. Nor is this in the leaſt degree ſurpriſing, when the circumſtances
which we ſhall faithfully relate in this deſcription are conſidered.</p>
                     <p>I muſt acknowledge, that I long doubted the exiſtence of this tree, until a ſtricter
enquiry convinced me of my error. I ſhall now only relate ſimple unadorned facts, of
which I have been an eye-witneſs. My readers may depend upon the fidelity of this
account. In the year 1774 I was ſtationed at Batavia, as a ſurgeon, in the ſervice of the
Dutch Eaſt-India Company. During my reſidence there I received ſeveral different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of the Bohon Upas, and the violent effects of its poiſon. They all then ſeemed
incredible to me, but raiſed my curioſity in ſo high a degree, that I reſolved to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
this ſubject thoroughly, and to truſt only to my own obſervations. In conſequence
of this reſolution, I applied to the Governor-General, Mr. Petrus Albertus van der Parra,
for a paſs to travel through the country: my requeſt was granted; and, having procured
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0811300400:572"/>
every information, I ſet out on my expedition. I had procured a recommendation from
an old Malayan prieſt to another prieſt, who lives on the neareſt inhabitable ſpot to the
tree, which is about fifteen or sixteen miles diſtant. The letter proved of great ſervice
to me in my undertaking, as that prieſt is appointed by the Emperor to reſide there, in
order to prepare for eternity the ſouls of thoſe who for different crimes are ſentenced to
approach the tree, and to procure the poiſon.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bohon-Upas</hi> is ſituated in the iſland of <hi>Java,</hi> about twenty-ſeven leagues from
<hi>Batavia,</hi> fourteen from <hi>Soura Charta,</hi> the ſeat of the Emperor, and between eighteen
and twenty leagues from <hi>Tinkjoe,</hi> the preſent reſidence of the Sultan of Java. It is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
on all ſides by a circle of high hills and mountains; and the country round it,
to the diſtance of ten or twelve miles from the tree, is entirely barren. Not a tree, nor
a ſhrub, nor even the leaſt plant or graſs is to be ſeen. I have made the tour all around
this dangerous ſpot, at about eighteen miles diſtant from the centre, and I found the
aſpect of the country on all ſides equally dreary. The eaſieſt aſcent of the hills is from
that part where the old eccleſiaſlick dwells. From his houſe the criminals are ſent for
the poiſon, into which the points of all warlike inſtruments are dipped. It is of high
value, and produces a conſiderable revenue to the Emperor.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Account of the manner in which the Poiſon is procured.</head>
                     <p>The poiſon which is procured from this tree is a gum that iſſues out between the bark
and the tree itſelf, like the <hi>camphor.</hi> Malefactors, who for their crimes are ſentenced
to die, are the only perſons who fetch the poiſon; and this is the only chance they have
of ſaving their lives. After ſentence is pronounced upon them by the judge, they are
aſked in court, whether they will die by the hands of the executioner, or whether they
will go to the Upas tree for a box of poiſon? They commonly prefer the latter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
as there is not only ſome chance of preſerving their lives, but alſo a certainty, in
caſe of their ſafe return, that a proviſion will be made for them in future by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.
They are alſo permitted to aſk a favour from the Emperor, which is generally
of a triffing nature, and commonly granted. They are then provided with a ſilver or
tortoiſeſhell box, in which they are to put the poiſonous gum, and are properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
how to proceed while they are upon their dangerous expedition. Among other
particulars, they are always told to attend to the direction of the winds; as they are to
go towards the tree before the wind, ſo that the effluvia from the tree are always blown
from them. They are told, likewiſe, to travel with the utmoſt diſpatch, as that is the
only method of inſuring a ſafe return. They are afterwards ſent to the houſe of the old
prieſt, to which place they are commonly attended by their friends and relations. Here
they generally remain ſome days, in expectation of a favourable breeze. During that
time the eccleſiaſtic prepares them for their future fate by prayers and admonitions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0811300400:573"/>
When the hour of their departure arrives, the prieſt puts them on a long leather-cap,
with two glaſſes before their eyes, which comes down as far as their breaſt; and alſo
provides them with a pair of leather-gloves. They are then conducted by the prieſt,
and their friends and relations, about two miles on their journey. Here the prieſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats
his inſtructions, and tells them where they are to look for the tree. He ſhews
them a hill, which they are told to aſcend, and that on the other ſide they will find a
rivulet, which they are to follow, and which will conduct them directly to the Upas.
They now take leave of each other; and, amidſt prayers for their ſucceſs, the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
haſten away.</p>
                     <p>The worthy old eccleſiaſtic has aſſured me, that during his reſidence there, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of thirty years, he had diſmiſſed above ſeven hundred criminals in the manner
which I have deſcribed; and that ſcarcely two out of twenty have returned. He ſhewed
me a catalogue of all the unhappy ſufferers, with the date of their departure from his
houſe annexed; and a liſt of the offences for which they had been condemned: to
which was added, a liſt of thoſe who had returned in ſafety. I afterwards ſaw another
liſt of theſe culprits, at the jail-keeper's at <hi>Soura-Charta,</hi> and found that they perfectly
correſponded with each other, and with the different informations which I afterwards
obtained.</p>
                     <p>I was preſent at ſome of theſe melancholy ceremonies, and deſired different delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
to bring with them ſome pieces of the wood, or a ſmall branch, or ſome leaves
of this wonderful tree. I have alſo given them ſilk cords, deſiring them to meaſure its
thickneſs. I never could procure more than two dry leaves that were picked up by one
of them on his return; and all I could learn from him, concerning the tree itſelf, was,
that it flood on the border of a rivulet, as deſcribed by the old prieſt; that it was of a
middling ſize; that five or ſix young trees of the ſame kind ſtood cloſe by it; but
that no other ſhrub or plant could be ſeen near it; and that the ground was of a
browniſh ſand, full of ſtones, almoſt impracticable for travelling, and covered with
dead bodies. After many converſations with the old Malayan prieſt, I queſtioned him
about the firſt diſcovery, and aſked his opinion of this dangerous tree; upon which he
gave me the following anſwer:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>We are told in our new Alcoran, that, above an hundred years ago, the country
around the tree was inhabited by a people ſtrongly addicted to the ſins of Sodom and
Gomorrha; when the great prophet Mahomet determined not to ſuffer them to lead
ſuch deteſtable lives any longer, he applied to God to puniſh them: upon which God
cauſed this tree to grow out of the earth, which deſtroyed them all, and rendered the
country for ever uninhabitable.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such was the Malayan opinion. I ſhall not attempt a comment; but muſt obſerve,
that all the Malayans conſider this tree as an holy inſtrument of the great prophet to
puniſh the ſins of mankind; and, therefore, to die of the poiſon of the Upas is generally
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0811300400:574"/>
conſidered among them as an honourable death. For that reaſon I alſo obſerved, that
the delinquents, who were going to the tree, were generally dreſſed in their beſt apparel.</p>
                     <p>This however is certain, though it may appear incredible, that from fifteen to
eighteen miles round this tree, not only no human creature can exiſt, but that, in that
ſpace of ground, no living animal of any kind has ever been diſcovered. I have alſo
been aſſured by ſeveral perſons of veracity, that there are no fiſh in the waters, nor
has any rat, mouſe, or any other vermin, been ſeen there; and when any birds fly ſo
near this tree that the effuvia reaches them, they fall a ſacrifice to the effects of the
poiſon. This circumſtance has been aſcertained by different delinquents, who, in their
return, have ſeen the birds drop down, and have picked them up <hi>dead,</hi> and brought
them to the old eccleſiaſtick.</p>
                     <p>I will here mention an inſtance, which proves them a fact beyond all doubt, and which
happened during my ſtay at Java.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1775 a rebellion broke out among the ſubjects of the Maſſay, a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
prince, whoſe dignity is nearly equal to that of the Emperor. They refuſed to
pay a duty impoſed upon them by their ſovereign, whom they openly oppoſed. The
Maſſay ſent a body of a thouſand troops to diſperſe the rebels, and to drive them, with
their families, out of his dominions. Thus four hundred families, conſiſting of above
ſixteen hundred ſouls, were obliged to leave their native country. Neither the Emperor
nor the Sultan would give them protection, not only becauſe they were rebels, but alſo
through ſear of diſpleaſing their neighbour, the Maſſay. In this diſtreſsful ſituation,
they had no other reſource than to repair to the uncultivated parts round the Upas, and
requeſted permiſſion of the Emperor to ſettle there. Their requeſt was granted, on
condition of their fixing their abode not more than twelve or fourteen miles from the
tree, in order not to deprive the inhabitants already ſettled there at a greater diſtance of
their cultivated lands. With this they were obliged to comply; but the conſequence
was, that in leſs than two months their number was reduced to about three hundred.
The chiefs of thoſe who remained returned to the Maſſay, informed him of their loſſes,
and intreated his pardon, which induced him to receive them again as ſubjects, thinking
them ſufficiently puniſhed for their miſconduct. I have ſeen and converſed with ſeveral
of thoſe who ſurvived ſoon after their return. They all had the appearance of perſons
tainted with an infectious diſorder; they looked pale and weak, and from the account
which they gave of the loſs of their comrades, of the ſymptoms and circumſtances
which attended their diſſolution, ſuch as convulſions, and other ſigns of a violent death,
I was fully convinced that they fell victims to the poiſon.</p>
                     <p>This violent effect of the poiſon at ſo great a diſtance from the tree, certainly appears
ſurpriſing, and almoſt incredible; and eſpecially when we conſider that it is poſſible for
delinquents who approach the tree to return alive. My wonder, however, in a great
meaſure, ceaſed, after I had made the following obſervations:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0811300400:575"/>
I have ſaid before, that malefactors are inſtructed to go to the tree with the wind,
and to return againſt the wind. When the wind continues to blow from the ſame
quarter while the delinquent travels thirty, or ſix and thirty miles, if he be of a good
conſtitution, he certainly ſurvives. But what proves the moſt deſtructive is, that there
is no dependence on the wind in that part of the world for any length of time.—There
are no regular land-winds; and the ſea-wind is not perceived there at all, the ſituation
of the tree being at too great a diſtance, and ſurrounded by high mountains and uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
foreſts. Beſides, the wind there never blows a freſh regular gale, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
merely a current of light, ſoft breezes, which paſs through the different openings
of the adjoining mountains. It is alſo frequently difficult to determine from what part
of the globe the wind really comes, as it is divided by various obſtructions in its paſſage,
which eaſily change the direction of the wind, and often totally deſtroy its effects.</p>
                     <p>I, therefore, impute the diſtant effects of the poiſon, in a great meaſure, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
gentle winds in thoſe parts, which have not power enough to diſperſe the poiſonous
particles. If high winds are more frequent and durable there, they would certainly
weaken very much, and even deſtroy the obnoxious effluvia of the poiſon; but without
them, the air remains infected and pregnant with theſe poiſonous vapours.</p>
                     <p>I am the more convinced of this, as the worthy eccleſiaſtick aſſured me, that a dead
calm is always attended with the greateſt danger, as there is a continual perſpiration
iſſuing from the tree, which is ſeen to riſe and ſpread in the air, like the putrid ſteam of
a marſhy cavern.</p>

                     <head>Experiments made with the Gum of the UPAS-TREE.</head>
                     <p>IN the year 1776, in the month of February, I was preſent at the execution of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
of the Emperor's concubines, at <hi>Soura-Charta,</hi> who were convicted of infidelity
to the Emperor's bed. It was in the forenoon, about eleven o'clock, when the fair cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals
were led into an open ſpace within the walls of the Emperor's palace. There
the judge paſſed ſentence upon them, by which they are doomed to ſuffer death by a
lancet poiſoned with Upas. After this the Alcoran was preſented to them, and they
were, according to the law of their great prophet Mahomet, to acknowledge and to
affirm by oath, that the charges brought againſt them, together with the ſentence and
their puniſhment, were fair and equitable. This they did, by laying their right hand
upon the Alcoran, their left hands upon their breaſt, and their eyes lifted towards
heaven; the judge then held the Alcoran to their lips, and they kiſſed it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ceremonies over, the executioner proceeded on his buſineſs in the following
manner:—Thirteen poſts, each about five feet high, had been previouſly erected. To
theſe the delinquents were faſtened, and their breaſts ſtripped naked. In this ſituation
they remained a ſhort time in continual prayers, attended by ſeveral prieſts, until a ſignal
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0811300400:576"/>
was given by the judge to the executioner; on which the latter produced an inſtrument,
much like the ſpring lancet uſed by farriers for bleeding horſes. With this inſtrument,
it being poiſoned with the gum of the Upas, the unhappy wretches were lanced in the
middle of their breaſts, and the operation was performed upon them all in leſs than two
minutes.</p>
                     <p>My aſtoniſhment was raiſed to the higheſt degree, when I beheld the ſudden effects
of that poiſon, for in about five minutes after they were lanced, they were taken with
a <hi>tremor,</hi> attended with a <hi>ſubſultus tendinum,</hi> after which they died in the greateſt agonies,
crying out to God and Mahomet for mercy. In ſixteen minutes by my watch, which I
held in my hand, all the criminals were no more. Some hours after their death, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
their bodies full of livid ſpots, much like thoſe of the <hi>Petech<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ae,</hi> their faces ſwelled,
their colour changed to a kind of blue, their eyes looked yellow, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>About a fortnight after this, I had an opportunity of ſeeing ſuch another execution
at Samarang. Seven Malayans were executed there with the ſame inſtrument, and
in the ſame manner; and I found the operation of the poiſon, and the ſpots in their
bodies exactly the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Theſe circumſtances made me deſirous to try an experiment with ſome animals, in
order to be convinced of the real effects of this poiſon; and as I had then two young
puppies, I thought them the fitteſt objects for my purpoſe. I accordingly procured with
great difficulty ſome grains of Upas. I diſſolved half a grain of that gum in a ſmall
quantity of arrack, and dipped a lancet into it. With this poiſoned inſtrument I made
an inciſion in the lower muſcular part of the belly in one of the puppies. Three minutes
after it received the wound the animal began to cry out moſt piteouſly, and ran as laſt as
poſſible from one corner of the room to the other. So it continued during ſix minutes,
when all its ſtrength being exhauſted, it fell upon the ground, was taken with convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and died in the eleventh minute. I repeated this experiment with two other pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
with a cat, and a fowl, and found the operation of the poiſon in all of them the
ſame: none of theſe animals ſurvived above thirteen minutes.</p>
                     <p>I thought it neceſſary to try alſo the effect of the poiſon given inwardly, which I
did in the following manner. I diſſolved a quarter of a grain of the gum in half an
ounce of arrack, and made a dog of ſeven months old drink it. In ſeven minutes
a retching enſued, and I obſerved, at the ſame time, that the animal was delirious, as it
ran up and down the room, fell on the ground, and tumb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed about; then it roſe again,
cried out very loud, and in about half an hour after was ſeized with convulſions, and
died. I opened the body, and found the ſtomach very much inflamed, as the inteſtines
were in ſome parts, but not ſo much as the ſtomach. There was a ſmall quantity of
coagulated blood in the ſtomach; but I could diſcover no orifice from which it could
have iſſued; and therefore ſuppoſed it to have been ſqueezed cut of the lungs, by the
animal's ſtraining while it was vomiting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0811300400:577"/>
From theſe experiments I have been convinced that the gum of the Upas is the
moſt dangerous and moſt violent of all vegetable poiſons; and I am apt to believe that
it greatly contributes to the unhealthineſs of that iſland. Nor is this the only evil
attending it: hundreds of the natives of Java, as well as Europeans, are yearly deſtroyed
and treacherouſly murdered by that poiſon, either internally or externally. Every man
of quality or faſhion has his dagger or other arms poiſoned with it; and in times of war
the Malayans poiſon the ſprings and other waters with it; by this treacherous practice
the Dutch ſuffered greatly during the laſt war, as it occaſioned the loſs of half their
army. For this reaſon, they have ever ſince kept fiſh in the ſprings of which they drink
the water; and ſentinels are placed near them, who inſpect the waters every hour, to
ſee whether the fiſh are alive. If they march with an army or body of troops into an
enemy's country, they always carry live fiſh with them, which they throw into the
water ſome hours before they venture to drink it; by which means they have been able
to prevent their total deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>This account, I flatter myſelf, will ſatisfy the curioſity of my readers, and the few
facts which I have related will be conſidered as a certain proof of the exiſtence of this
pernicious tree, and its penetrating effects.</p>
                     <p>If it be aſked why we have not yet any more ſatisfactory accounts of this tree, I can
only anſwer, that the object to moſt travellers to that part of the world conſiſts more in
commercial purſuits than in the ſtudy of Natural Hiſtory and the advancement of
Sciences. Beſides, Java is ſo univerſally reputed an unhealthy iſland, that rich travellers
ſeldom make any long ſtay in it; and other want money, and generally are too igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the language to travel, in order to make enquiries. In future, thoſe who viſit
this iſland will probably now be induced to make it an object of their reſearches, and
will furniſh us with a fuller deſcription of this tree.</p>
                     <p>I will therefore only add, that there exiſts alſo a ſort of Cajoe-Upas on the coaſt of
Macaſſar, the poiſon of which operates nearly in the ſame manner, but is not half ſo
violent or malignant as that of Java, and of which I ſhall likewiſe give a more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
