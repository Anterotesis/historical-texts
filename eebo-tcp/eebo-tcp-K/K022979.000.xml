            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE ESSAY ON MAN was intended to have been compriſed in Four Books:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of which, the Author has given us under that title, in four Epiſtles.
The <hi>Second</hi> was to have conſiſted of the ſame number: 1. Of the extent and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of human Reaſon. 2. Of thoſe Arts and Sciences, and of the parts of them,
which are uſeful, and therefore attainable, together with thoſe which are unuſeful, and
therefore unattainable. 3. Of the Nature, Ends, Uſe, and Application of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Capacities of Men. 4. Of the Uſe of Learning, of the Science of the World,
and of Wit: concluding with a Satyr againſt the Miſapplication of them, illuſtrated by
Pictures, Characters, and Examples.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Book regarded Civil Regimen, or the Science of Politics, in which the
ſeveral forms of a Republic were to have been examined and explained; together with the
ſeveral Modes of Religious Worſhip, as far forth as they affect Society; between which,
the Author always ſuppoſed there was the moſt intereſting relation and cloſeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection;
ſo that this part would have treated of Civil and Religious Society in their full
extent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt Book concerned private Ethics or practical Morality, conſidered
in all the Circumſtances, Orders, Profeſſions, and Stations of human Life.</p>
            <p>The Scheme of all this had been maturely digeſted, and communicated to the L.
Bolinbroke. Dr Swift, and one or two more, and was intended for the only work of
his riper Years: But was, partly thro' ill health, partly thro' diſcouragements from
the depravity of the times, and partly on prudential and other conſiderations, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
poſtponed, and, laſtly, in a manner laid aſide.</p>
            <p>But as this was the Author's favourite Work, which more exactly reflected the Image
of his ſtrong capacious Mind, and as we can have but a very imperfect idea of it from the
<hi>disjecta membra Poetae</hi> that now remain, it may not be amiſs to be a little more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
concerning each of theſe projected books.</p>
            <p>The FIRST, as it treats of Man in the abſtract, and conſiders him in general under
every of his relations, becomes the foundation, and furniſhes out the ſubjects, of the
<hi>three</hi> following; ſo that</p>
            <p>The SECOND Book takes up again the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> Epiſtles of the <hi>Firſt</hi> Book,
and treats of man in his intellectual Capacity at large, as has been explained above. Of
this, only a ſmall part of the concluſion (which, as we ſaid, was to have contained
a Satyr againſt the miſapplication of Wit and Learning) may be found in the <hi>Fourth</hi>
Book of the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> and up and down, occaſionally, in the other <hi>three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1230800300:4"/>
The <hi>Third</hi> Book, in like manner, reaſſumes the ſubject of the <hi>Third</hi> Epiſtle of the
<hi>Firſt,</hi> which treats of Man in his Social, Political, and Religious Capacity. But this
part the Poet afterwards conceived might be beſt executed in an EPIC POEM; as the
Action would make it more animated, and the Fable leſs invidious; in which all the great
Principles of true and falſe Governments and Religions ſhould be chiefly delivered in
feigned Examples. In purſuance of this deſign, he plan'd out a Poem on the ſubject
of the fabulous BRUTUS, the great Grandſon of Aeneas: whoſe firſt and predominant
principle he makes to be Benevolence; from this Ruling Paſſion ariſes a ſtrong deſire
to redeem the remains of his countrymen, then captives amongſt the Greeks, from
ſlavery and miſery, and to eſtabliſh their freedom and felicity on a juſt form of
Civil Government. He had ſeen how falſe Policy, and Superſtitions and Vices proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from it, had cauſed the ruin of Troy; and he was enabled to avoid the <hi>one</hi> by the
lights his countrymen, whom he had now gathered from their diſperſion, could afford
him from their obſervations on the various policies of the Grecian Cities; and to reform
the <hi>other</hi> by the Wiſdom he himſelf had gained in Italy, where Evander, as we are told
by Virgil, had reformed the reigning Superſtitions:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Rex Evandrus ait: non haec ſollemnia nobis</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Vana ſuperſtitio veterumque ignara Deorum</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Impoſuit—</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
Thus qualified for the office of Legiſlation, he puts to ſea with a number of brave follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
enters the Atlantic Ocean; and after various traverſes (each of which produces ſome
new leſſon of Politics) he arrives in Britain, where having ſurmounted many ſucceſſive
difficulties, which bring him ſtill nearer and nearer to the point the poet aims at, he at
length eſtabliſhes for his Trojans that perfect form of Civil Government which it was
our author's purpoſe to recommend. The poem opens (of which very few lines of
the introduction only were written) with Brutus at the Straits of Calpé, in ſight of the
<hi>ne plus ultra</hi> on Hercules's Pillars, debating in councel whether he ſhould enter the
great ocean.</p>
            <p>The FOURTH and laſt Book purſues the ſubject of the <hi>Fourth</hi> Epiſtle of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and
treats of <hi>Ethics,</hi> or practical Morality; and would have conſiſted of many members; of
of which the four following Epiſtles were detached Portions: the <hi>two firſt,</hi> on the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of Men and Women</hi> being the <hi>introductory</hi> part of this concluding Book.</p>

               <p>EPISTLE I.] This Epiſtle is divided into three principal parts or members: The Firſt
[from ℣ 1 to 99.] treats of the difficulties in coming at the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and true <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of Men.</hi>—The Second [from ℣ 98 to 173.] of the <hi>wrong means</hi> which both <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi>
and <hi>Men of the World</hi> have employed in ſurmounting thoſe difficulties. And the
Third [from ℣ 174 to the end] treats of the <hi>right means</hi> with directions for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of them.</p>
               <div n="1" type="part">

                     </q> The Epiſtle is introduced [from ℣ 1 to 15]
in obſerving, that the <hi>Knowledge of Men</hi> is neither to be gained by Books nor Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
alone, but by the joint uſe of both; for that the <hi>Maxims</hi> of the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and
the <hi>Concluſions</hi> of the <hi>Man of the World</hi> can, ſeparately, but ſupply a vague and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
knowledge: And often not ſo much, as thoſe <hi>Maxims</hi> are founded in the abſtract
<hi>notions</hi> of the writer; and theſe <hi>concluſions</hi> are drawn from the uncertain <hi>conjectures</hi> of
the obſerver: But when the writer joins his <hi>ſpeculation</hi> to the <hi>experience</hi> of the obſerver,
his <hi>notions</hi> are rectified into <hi>principles</hi>; and when the obſerver regulates his <hi>experience</hi>
on the <hi>general principles</hi> of the writer, his <hi>conjectures</hi> advance into <hi>ſcience.</hi> Such is the
reaſoning of this introduction; which beſides its propriety to the general ſubject
of the Epiſtle, has a peculiar relation to each of its parts or members: For the
<hi>cauſes of the difficulty</hi> in coming at the knowledge and characters of men, explained
in the Firſt, will ſhew the importance of what is here delivered, of the <hi>joint</hi> aſſiſtance
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1230800300:6"/>
of ſpeculation and practice to ſurmount it; and the <hi>wrong means</hi> which both <hi>philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
and <hi>men of the world</hi> have employed in overcoming thoſe difficulties diſcourſed of
in the Second, have their ſource here deduced, which is ſeen to be a <hi>ſeparate</hi> adherence
of each to his own method of ſtudying men, and a mutual contempt of the others.
Laſtly, the <hi>right means</hi> delivered in the Third, will be of little uſe in the application,
without the direction here delivered: For tho' <hi>obſervation</hi> diſcovered a <hi>ruling paſſion,</hi>
yet, without a <hi>philoſophic</hi> knowledge of the human mind, we may eaſily miſtake a
<hi>ſecondary</hi> and <hi>ſubſidiary</hi> paſſion for the <hi>principal,</hi> and ſo be never the nearer in the
Knowledge of Men. But the elegant and eaſy <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>introduction</hi> equals the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of its <hi>matter</hi>; for the Epiſtle being addreſſed to a noble perſon, diſtinguiſhed for
his knowledge of the World, it opens, as it were, in the midſt of a familiar converſe,
which lets us at once into his character; where the poet, by affecting <hi>only</hi> to ridicule
the uſeleſs Knowledge of Men confined to Books, and under the appearance of extolling
only that acquired by the World, artfully inſinuates how equally defective this may be,
when conducted on the ſame narrow principle: Which is too often the caſe, as <hi>men of
the world</hi> are more than ordinarily prejudiced in favour of their own obſervations for
the ſake of the obſerver, and, for the ſame reaſon, leſs indulgent to the diſcoveries of
others.</p>

                     </q> The poet enters on the Firſt diviſion of his
ſubject, <hi>the difficulties of coming at the Knowledge and true Characters of Men.</hi> The
I. cauſe of this difficulty, which he proſecutes from ℣ 14 to 19. is the great <hi>diverſity
of Characters,</hi> of which, to abate our wonder, and not diſcourage our inquiry, he only
deſires we would <hi>grant</hi> him

Hereby artfully inſinuating, that if Nature has varied the moſt worthleſs vegetable into
above three hundred ſpecies, we need not wonder at the like diverſity in the human
mind: And if a variety in that vegetable has been thought of importance enough to
employ the leiſure of a ſerious enquirer, much more will the ſame quality in this
maſter-piece of Nature deſerve our ſtudy and attention.</p>

                     </q> A ſecond cauſe of this difficulty [from

                     </q> A third cauſe [from ℣ 20 to 23.] is that <hi>obſcurity</hi>
thrown over the Characters of men, thro' the ſtrife and conteſt between <hi>nature</hi> and

of difficulty ariſing from the <hi>obſeurity of the Object</hi>; he now comes to thoſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from <hi>defects in the Obſerver.</hi> The Firſt of which, and a ſixth cauſe of difficulty,
he ſhews [from ℣ 30 to 57.] is the perverſe <hi>manners, affections,</hi> and <hi>imagination</hi> of the
obſerver, whereby the Characters of others are rarely ſeen either in their true <hi>light,</hi>

                     </q> The Second of theſe, and ſeventh
cauſe of difficulty [from ℣ 36 to 41.] is the <hi>ſhortneſs of human life,</hi> which will not
ſuffer the obſerver to ſelect and weigh out his knowledge, but juſt to ſnatch it as it
rolls rapidly by him down the current of Time.</p>

                     </q> We come now to the eighth and laſt cauſe,
which very properly concludes the account, as, in a ſort, it ſums up all the difficulties
in one [from ℣ 40 to 51.] namely, that very often the <hi>man himſelf is ignorant of his
own motive of action</hi>; the cauſe of which ignorance our author has admirably explain'd:
When the mind (ſays he) is now quite tired out by the long conflict of oppoſite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
it withdraws its attention, and ſuffers the <hi>will</hi> to be ſeized upon by the firſt that
afterwards obtrudes itſelf, without taking notice what that motive is. This is finely
illuſtrated by what he ſuppoſes the general cauſe of dreams; where the fancy juſt let
looſe poſſeſſes itſelf of the <hi>laſt image</hi> which it meets with on the confines between ſleep
and waking, and on that eracts all its viſionary operation; yet this image is, with great
difficulty, recollected; and never, but when ſome accident happens to interrupt our
firſt ſlumbers: Then (which proves the truth of the hypotheſis) we are ſometimes able to
trace the workings of the Fancy backwards, from image to image, in a chain, till we
come to that from whence they all aroſe.</p>

                     </q> But now in anſwer to all this, an <hi>objector,</hi> as
the author ſhews [from ℣ 50 to 61.] may ſay, <q rend="inline">"That theſe difficulties ſeem to be aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated:
For many Characters are ſo plainly marked, that no man can miſtake them:
And not ſo only in the more <hi>open</hi> and <hi>frank,</hi> but in the very <hi>cloſeſt</hi> and moſt <hi>recluſe</hi>
likewiſe."</q> Of each of which the objector gives an inſtance, whereby it appears, that
the forbidding cloſeneſs and concealed hypocriſy in the one, are as conſpicuous to all
mankind, as the gracious openneſs and frank plain-dealing of the other. — The
Reader ſees this objection is more particularly level'd at the doctrine of ℣ 23.

for it here endeavours to prove, that both are equally explorable.</p>

                     </q> To this objection, therefore, our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
replies [from ℣ 60 to 67.] that indeed the fact may be true in the inſtances
given, but that ſuch <hi>plain characters</hi> are extremely rare: And for the truth of this,
he not only appeals to experience, but explains the cauſes of it: 1. The Firſt of
which is, the <hi>vivacity of the Imagination</hi>; for that when the bias of the Paſſions is
enough determined to mark out the Character, yet then, as the vigour of the Fancy
generally riſes in proportion to the ſtrength of the Appetites, the one no ſooner directs
the bias, than the other reverſes it,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Tho'</hi> ſtrong <hi>the bent, yet</hi> quick <hi>the turns of mind.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
2. A Second cauſe is the <hi>contrariety of Appetites,</hi> which drawing ſeveral ways, as <hi>Avarice</hi>
and <hi>Luxury, Ambition</hi> and <hi>Indolence, &amp;c.</hi> they muſt needs make the ſame Character in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
to itſelf, and conſequently inexplicable to the obſerver,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Or puzzling</hi> Contraries <hi>confound the whole.</hi>

                     </q> 3. A Third cauſe is <hi>Affectation,</hi> that aſpires to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
which neither <hi>nature</hi> nor <hi>education</hi> has given us, and which, conſequently, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>art</hi> nor <hi>uſe</hi> will ever render graceful or becoming. On this account it is, he well
obſerves, that <hi>Affectation reverſes the ſoul</hi>; other <hi>natural paſſions</hi> may indeed turn it
from that bias which the <hi>ruling one</hi> has given it; but the <hi>affected paſſions</hi> diſtort all its
faculties, and cramp all its operations; ſo that it acts with the ſame conſtraint that a
tumbler walks upon his hands.</p>

to the Knowledge and true Characters of men, enters now upon the <hi>ſecond diviſion</hi> of
his Poem, which is <hi>of the wrong means that both Philoſophers and Men of the world
have employed in ſurmounting thoſe difficulties.</hi> He had, in the Introduction, ſpoken of
the abſurd conduct of both, in deſpiſing the aſſiſtance of each other: He now juſtifies
his cenſure by an examination of their peculiar doctrines; and, to take them in their
own way, conſiders them, as they would be conſidered, <hi>ſeparately.</hi> And <hi>firſt,</hi> of the
<hi>Philoſopher,</hi> whoſe principal miſtake is in ſuppoſing <hi>that Actions beſt decipher</hi> the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the actor.</hi> This he confutes [from ℣ 99 to 109.] by ſhewing that <hi>different
Actions</hi> proceed often from the <hi>ſame motive</hi>; whether of <hi>accident,</hi> as diſappointed views;
or of <hi>temperature,</hi> as an aduſt complexion; which he thus illuſtrates,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Behold if Fortune or a Miſtreſs frown, &amp;c.</hi>

                     </q>
In judging therefore of <hi>Motives</hi> by <hi>Actions,</hi> the Philoſopher muſt needs be frequently
miſled; becauſe the paſſion or appetite which, when impelling to <hi>Action,</hi> we call the
<hi>Motive,</hi> may be equally gratified in the purſuit of quite different meaſures.</p>

                     </q> The Philoſopher's <hi>ſecond</hi> miſtake
is, that <hi>Actions decipher the character of the actor.</hi> This too, the author confutes [from
℣ 118 to 135.] and, as in correcting the foregoing miſtake, he proved, <hi>that different
Actions often proceed from the ſame Motive</hi>; ſo here he proves, <hi>that the ſame Actions often
proceeds from different Motives</hi>; thus a <hi>kind Action,</hi> he obſerves, as commonly ariſes
from the accidents of proſperity or fine weather, as from a natural diſpoſition to huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
a <hi>modeſt Action,</hi> as well from pride as humility; a <hi>brave Action,</hi> as eaſily from
habit or faſhion, as magnanimity; and a <hi>prudent Action</hi> as often from vanity as wiſdom.
Now the <hi>Character</hi> being really determined by the <hi>Motives,</hi> and various, nay contrary
<hi>Motives</hi> producing the ſame <hi>Action,</hi> the <hi>Action</hi> can never decipher the <hi>Character of the
actor.</hi> But further (continues the poet) if we attend to what has been ſaid, we ſhall
diſcover another circumſtance in the caſe, that will not only make it extremely diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
but abſolutely impracticable to decipher the Character by the Action; and that is,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1230800300:16"/>
the <hi>diſcordancy of Action</hi> in the ſame Character; a neceſſary conſequence of the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
proved above, that <hi>different Actions proceed from the ſame Motive,</hi> and that <hi>the ſame
Action proceeds from different Motives.</hi>

you are not to ſelected ſuch only as you like, or can manage, you muſt fairly take all
you find: But, when you have got theſe together, they will prove ſo very diſcordant
that no conſiſtent Character can poſſibly be made out of them. What is then to be
done? Will you <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> all thoſe you cannot reconcile to the few capital Actions
which you chuſe for the foundation of your Character? But this the laws of truth will
not allow of. Will you then miſcall them? and ſay they were not the natural work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the man, but the diſguiſes of the politician? But what will you get by that,
but the very reverſing the beſt known Character, and making the owner of it the
direct oppoſite of himſelf? And this (ſays our author) the reaſoning and philoſophic
hiſtorian has always been ready to do with the <hi>Actions</hi> of great men; of which he
gives two famous inſtances in the life of Caefar. The concluſion from the whole is,
that <hi>Actions do not ſhew the Man.</hi>

poet's reaſoning, he thought it deſerving of his ridicule; and the ſtrongeſt was what
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1230800300:18"/>
he gives [from ℣ 134 to 141.] a naked expoſition of the fact; to which he has ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
[from ℣ 140 to 149.] an ironical apology, that, as Virtue is cultivated with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
more labour in Courts than in Cottages, it is but juſt to ſet an infinitely higher
value on it; which, ſays he, with much pleaſantry, is moſt agreeable to all the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ways of eſtimation. For why do the connoiſſeurs prefer the lively colour in a
Gem before that in a Flower, but for its extreme rarity and difficulty of production?</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1230800300:22"/>
convince us of which, he applies it [from ℣ 179 to 210.] to the moſt wild and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
Character that ever was; which (when drawn out at length in a ſpirit of poetry
as rare as the character itſelf) we ſee, this <hi>Principle</hi> unravels, and renders throughout

                     </q> But here [from ℣ 209 to 222.] he gives one
very neceſſary caution, that, in developing the <hi>Ruling Paſſion,</hi> we muſt be careful not
to miſtake a <hi>ſubſidiary</hi> paſſion for the <hi>principal</hi>; which, without great attention, we
may be very liable to do; as the <hi>ſubſidiary,</hi> acting in ſupport of the <hi>principal,</hi> has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
all its <hi>vigour</hi> and much of its <hi>perſeverance:</hi> This error has miſled ſeveral both
of the ancient and modern hiſtorians; as when they ſuppoſed <hi>Luſt</hi> and <hi>Luxury</hi> to be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1230800300:24"/>
Characteriſtics of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Lucullus</hi>; whereas, in truth, the <hi>Ruling Paſſion</hi> of both was
<hi>Ambition</hi>; which is ſo certain, that, at whatſoever different time of the Republic theſe
men had lived, their <hi>Ambition,</hi> as the <hi>Ruling Paſſion,</hi> had been the ſame; but a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
time had changed their <hi>ſubſidiary</hi> ones of <hi>Luſt</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi> into their very oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites
of <hi>Chaſtity</hi> and <hi>Frugality.</hi> 'Tis in vain, therefore, ſays our author, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver
of human nature to ſix his attention on the <hi>Workman,</hi> if he all the while miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
the <hi>Scaffold</hi> for the <hi>Building.</hi>

                     </q> But now it may be objected to our philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic
poet, that he has indeed ſhewn <hi>the true means</hi> of coming to <hi>the Knowledge and
Characters of men</hi> by a <hi>Principle</hi> certain and infallible, when found, yet, by his own
account, of ſo difficult inveſtigation, that its <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> and it is always attended
with one, may be eaſily miſtaken for it. To remove this difficulty, therefore, and
conſequently the objection that ariſes from it, the poet has given [from ℣ 221 to 228.]
one certain and infallible criterion of the <hi>Ruling Paſſion,</hi> which is this, that all the
<hi>other</hi> paſſions, in the courſe of time, change and wear away; while <hi>this</hi> is ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and vigorous; and ſtill going on from ſtrength to ſtrength, to the very moment
of its demoliſhing the miſerable machine that it has now at length overworked. Of
this great truth, the poet [from ℣ 227 to the end] gives various inſtances in all the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1230800300:26"/>
principal <hi>Ruling Paſſions</hi> of our nature, as they are to be found in the <hi>Man of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>

expectation, and contrary to the beſt-laid
ſchemes of worldly policy, cannot but
confeſs that human affairs are ordered by
ſome power extrinſical. To acknowledge
a God and his Providence would be next
to introducing a morality deſtructive of

                        <hi>Nothing ſo true, &amp;c.</hi>]</l>
                  </q> The
reader perhaps may be diſappointed to find
that this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> which propoſes the ſame
ſubject with the preceding, is conducted
on very different rules of method; for
inſtead of being diſpoſed in the ſame lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
connection, and filled with the like
philoſophical remarks, it is wholly taken
up in drawing a great variety of capital
Characters: But if he would reflect,
that the <hi>two Sexes</hi> make but <hi>one Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
and conſequently, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of both muſt be ſtudied and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
on the ſame principles, he would
ſee, that when the poet had done this
in the preceding Epiſtle, his buſineſs here
was, not to repeat what he had already
delivered, but only to verify and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
his doctrine, by every <hi>view</hi> of that
perplexity of Nature, which his philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
only can explain. If the reader there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will but be at the pains to ſtudy
theſe Characters with any degree of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
as they are here maſterly drawn,
one important particular (for which the
poet has artfully prepared him by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction)
will very forcibly ſtrike his
obſervation; and that is, that all the great
ſtrokes in the ſeveral Characters of <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
are not only infinitely perplexed and
diſcordant, like thoſe in <hi>Men,</hi> but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
inconſiſtent, and in a much higher
degree <hi>contradictory.</hi> As ſtrange as this
may appear, yet he will ſee that the poet
has all the while ſtrictly follow'd Nature,
whoſe ways, we find by the former Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1230800300:29"/>
are not a little myſterious; and a
myſtery this might have remained, had
not our author explained it at ℣ 207.
where he ſhuts up his <hi>Characters</hi> with this
philoſophical reflexion:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>In Men, we</hi> various ruling Paſſions <hi>find,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>In Women,</hi> two <hi>almoſt divide the kind;</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Thoſe only fix'd they firſt or laſt obey,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>The love of Pleaſure, and the love of Sway.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
If this account be true, we ſee the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
neceſſity (which is not the caſe in
<hi>Men</hi>) that <hi>Women</hi> lye under of <hi>diſguiſing</hi>
their <hi>ruling Paſſion.</hi> Now the variety of
arts employed to this purpoſe muſt needs
draw them into infinite contradictions in
thoſe <hi>Actions</hi> from whence their general
and obvious Character is denominated:
To verify this obſervation, let the reader
examine all the Characters here drawn,
and try whether with this key he cannot
diſcover that all their Contradictions ariſe
from a deſire to hide the <hi>ruling Paſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not the worſt. The poet
afterwards [from ℣ 219 to 248.] takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of another miſchief ariſing from this
neceſſity of hiding their ruling Paſſions;
which is, that generally the end of each
is defeated even there where they are
moſt violently purſued: For the neceſſity
of hiding them inducing an habitual diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of mind, Reaſon, whoſe office it
is to regulate the <hi>ruling Paſſion,</hi> loſes
all its force and direction; and theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
victims to their principles, tho'
with their attention ſtill <hi>fixed</hi> upon them,
are ever proſecuting the means deſtructive
of their end, and thus become ridiculous
in youth, and miſerable in old age.</p>
               <p>Let me not omit to obſerve the great
beauty of the concluſion: It is an Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium
on the Lady to whom the Epiſtle
is addreſſed, and artfully turns upon the
fact which makes the ſubject of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
the <hi>contradiction of a Woman's Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,</hi>
in which contradiction he ſhews that
all the luſtre of the beſt Character conſiſts.</p>

in what it conſiſts; it is this, that
the <hi>Similitudes</hi> in his didactic poems, of
which he is not ſparing, and which are
highly poetical, are always choſen with
ſuch exquiſite diſcernment of Nature, as
not only to illuſtrate the particular point
he is upon, but to eſtabliſh the general
principles he would inforce; ſo, in the
inſtance before us, he compares the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy
and contradiction in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of Women, to the change of
colours in the Chameleon; yet 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
the great principle of this poem
to ſhew that the general Characteriſtic of
the Sex, as to the Ruling Paſſion, which
they all have, is more uniform than that in
Man: Now for this purpoſe, all Nature
could not have ſupplied ſuch another il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration
as this of the Chameleon; for
tho' it inſtantaneouſly aſſumes much of
the colour of every ſubject on which it
chances to be placed, yet, as the moſt
accurate <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> have obſerved, it has
two native colours of its own, which,
amidſt all theſe charges are never totally
diſcharged, but, tho' often diſcoloured
by the neighbourhood of adventitious
ones, ſtill make the foundation, and give
a tincture to all thoſe which, from thence,
it occaſionally aſſumes.</p>

is not enough to make a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter

                  </q> Having thus ſettled the terms of the <hi>Debate,</hi>
before he comes to the <hi>main Queſtion,</hi> the <hi>Uſe of Riches,</hi> it was neceſſary to diſcuſs a

                  <hi>previous</hi> one, whether indeed they are upon the whole, <hi>uſeful to mankind or not</hi>; [which
he does from ℣ 20 to 77.] It is commonly obſerved, ſays he [from ℣ 21 to 35.]
<hi>That Gold moſt commodiouſly ſupplies the wants of Nature:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Let us firſt conſider the

we ſhall ſee, are very <hi>ambiguous</hi>; under that term, all our fantaſtic and imaginary
as well as real wants being comprized. Hitherto the uſe is not very apparent. Let
us in the ſecond place, therefore, conſider the propoſition in <hi>particular,</hi> or how
Gold ſupplies the <hi>wants of Nature</hi> both in private and public life: 1. As to <hi>private</hi>;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1230800300:48"/>
it aids us, indeed, to ſupport life; but it, at the ſame times, hires the aſſaſſin:
2. As to <hi>Society</hi>; it may procure Friendſhips and extend Trade; but it allures Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and corrupts our acquaintance. 3. As to <hi>Government</hi>; it pays the Guards ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the ſupport of public liberty; but it may, with the ſame eaſe, bribe a
Senate to overturn it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The matter therefore being thus problematical, the poet, inſtead of formally ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing
between the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Ill,</hi> chuſes to leave this <hi>previous Queſtion undetermined,</hi>
(as <hi>Tacitus</hi> had done before him; where, ſpeaking of the ancient <hi>Germans,</hi> he ſays,
<hi>Argentum et aurum propitii aut irati Dii negaverint dubito</hi>;) and falls at once upon what
he eſteems the <hi>principal</hi> of theſe abuſes, <hi>public Corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1230800300:49"/>
For having in the laſt inſtance, of the <hi>Uſe of Riches</hi> in Government, ſpoken of <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Senates,</hi> he goes on to lament the miſchief as deſperate and remedileſs; <hi>Gold,</hi>
by its power to corrupt with <hi>Secrecy,</hi> defeating all the efforts of public Spirit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exerted in the Courage of Heroes, or in the Wiſdom of Patriots.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, continues the poet [from ℣ 34 to 51.] the very weight of the
Bribery has ſometimes detected the Corruption:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>From the crack'd bag the dropping Guinea</hi> ſpoke<hi>, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
But this inconvenience was ſoon repaired, by the invention of <hi>Paper credit:</hi> Whoſe
dreadful effects on public Liberty he deſcribes in all the colouring of his poetry,
heightened by the warmeſt concern for virtue; which now makes him willing to
give up, as it were, the <hi>previous queſtion,</hi> in a paſſionate wiſh [from ℣ 49 to 59.] for
the return of that incumbrance attendant on public Corruption, before the ſo <hi>common</hi>
uſe of money.</p>
               <p>And pleaſed with this flattering Idea, he goes on [from ℣ 58 to 77.] to ſhew the
other advantages that would accrue from <hi>Riches only in kind</hi>; which are, that neither
<hi>Avarice</hi> could contrive to hoard, nor <hi>Prodigality</hi> to laviſh, in ſo mad and boundleſs a
manner as they do at preſent. Here he ſhews particularly, in a fine ironical deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the embarras on <hi>Gaming,</hi> how effectually it would eradicate that execrable
practice.</p>
               <p>But this whole <hi>Digreſſion</hi> [from ℣ 34 to 79.] has another very uncommon beauty;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1230800300:50"/>
for, at the ſame time that it ariſes naturally from the <hi>laſt</hi> conſideration in the debate
of the <hi>previous Queſtion,</hi> it artfully denounces, in our entrance on the <hi>main Queſtion,</hi>
the principal topics intended to be employed for the dilucidation of it, namely AVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICE,
PROFUSION, and PUBLIC CORRUPTION.</p>

the incumbrance which the want of money would occaſion to all criminal exceſſes in
the uſe of Riches, particularly to <hi>Gaming,</hi> which being now become of public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
he affects much regard to:

                        <hi>Since then, my Lord, on ſuch a World we fall,</hi>

                     <l>
                        <hi>Meat, Fire, and Cloaths. What more? Meat, Cloaths, and Fire.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q> The mere <hi>turn</hi> of the expreſſion here ſhews, without further reaſoning, that all the

who would <hi>more than live,</hi> are only theſe <hi>three</hi> things diverſified throughout every wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
mode of Luxury and Wantonneſs.</p>
               <p>Yet as little as this is, adds the poet, [from ℣ 81 to 85.] it is only to be had by the
<hi>moderate uſe</hi> of Riches; <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Profuſion</hi> not allowing the poſſeſſors of the moſt
exorbitant wealth even this little:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Alas! 'tis more than</hi> Turner <hi>finds they give.</hi>

                     </l>
                  </q>
But what is it you would expect them to give? continues the poet [from ℣ 84 to 91.]
Would you have them capable of <hi>reſtoring</hi> thoſe <hi>real</hi> bleſſings, which men have <hi>loſt</hi> by
their <hi>Vices</hi> or their <hi>Villanies</hi>; or of <hi>ſatisfying</hi> thoſe <hi>imaginary</hi> ones, which they have
<hi>gotten</hi> by their <hi>irregular Appetites</hi> and <hi>Paſſions</hi>; <hi>theſe,</hi> ſure, the bad or fooliſh man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1230800300:53"/>
have the face to demand; and <hi>thoſe,</hi> by the wiſe proviſion of Nature, Riches are
incapable of giving if he had.</p>
               <p>But now admit, purſues our author [from ℣ 90 to 97.] that wealth might, in ſome
caſes alleviate the unmerited miſeries of life, by procuring medicines both for the mind
and body; yet it is not to be thought it ſhould operate like a charm, while only worn
about one: Yet this, theſe <hi>poor men of pelf</hi> expect from it, while <hi>Avarice,</hi> on the one
hand, witholds them from giving at all, even to the <hi>Doctor</hi> in extremity; or <hi>Vanity</hi>
diverts the donation from a <hi>Friend</hi> in life, to the Endowment of a <hi>Cat</hi> or <hi>College</hi> at
their death. It is true, <hi>Riches</hi> might give the greateſt of all bleſſings, a <hi>virtuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs</hi>
of our having employ'd them as became the <hi>ſubſtitutes of Providence,</hi>

                  </q> For now the poet comes, in the Second place, to
examine, II. <hi>Of what uſe Riches are to others</hi>; which he teaches, as is his way through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this poem, by the <hi>abuſe</hi> that ſtands oppoſed to it: Thus he ſhews [from ℣ 96 to
107.] that with regard to acts of <hi>Beneficence,</hi> the utmoſt Heaven will grant to thoſe
who ſo greatly abuſe its bleſſings, is either to enrich ſome favourite <hi>Baſtard,</hi> and ſo
perpetuate their vice and infamy; or elſe, contrary to their intent, a legitimate <hi>Son
they hated,</hi> and ſo expoſe to public ſcorn and ridicule, the defeat of their unnatural cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.
But with regard to acts of <hi>Charity,</hi> they are given up to ſo reprobate a ſenſe,
as to believe they are then ſeconding the deſigns of Heaven, when they purſue the
indigent with imprecations, or leave them in the midſt of their diſtreſſes unrelieved, as
the common enemies of God and Man.</p>
               <p>

                  <q rend="inline">VER. 107. <l>
                        <hi>Yet to be juſt, &amp;c.</hi>]</l>
                  </q> Having thus ſhewn the <hi>true uſe</hi> of Riches in a
deſcription of the <hi>abuſe,</hi> and how that uſe is perpetually defeated by <hi>Profuſion</hi> and
<hi>Avarice,</hi> it was natural to enquire into the ſpring and original of theſe vices; as the
<hi>abuſe</hi> they occaſion, muſt be well underſtood, before it can be corrected. The
diſpoſition, therefore, of his ſubject now calls upon him to come to the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi>
of it: And he examines particularly into the <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>Avarice:</hi> But what is
very obſervable, he, all along, ſatyrically, intermixes with the <hi>real motives,</hi> ſeveral
<hi>imaginary</hi>; and thoſe as wild as imagination could conceive. This, which at firſt ſight
might ſeem to vitiate the purpoſe of his <hi>philoſophical inquiry,</hi> is found, when duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
to have the higheſt art of deſign. His buſineſs, the reader ſees, was to prove
that the <hi>real motives</hi> had the higheſt extravagancy: Nothing could more conduce to
this end, than the ſetting them by, and comparing them with, the moſt extravagant
that the fancy itſelf could invent; in which ſituation it was ſeen, that the <hi>real</hi> were
full as wild as the <hi>fictitious.</hi> To give theſe images all the force they were capable of,
he firſt deſcribes [from ℣ 118 to 123.] the <hi>real</hi> and a different <hi>imaginary</hi> motive in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1230800300:56"/>
the <hi>ſame perſon:</hi> and then [from ℣ 122 to 133.] an <hi>imaginary</hi> one, and a <hi>real,</hi> the very
ſame with the imaginary in <hi>different perſons.</hi> This addreſs the poet himſelf alludes to
℣ 155.
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Leſs mad the wildeſt whimſy we can frame, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
Let me obſerve, that this has ſtill a further beauty, ariſing from the <hi>nature</hi> of the
poem, which (as we have ſhewn) is partly <hi>ſatyrical,</hi> and partly <hi>philoſophical.</hi>—With
regard to the <hi>particular</hi> beauties of this diſpoſition, I ſhall only take notice of one;
where the poet introduces the <hi>fictitious</hi> motive of Blunt's avarice, by a wizard's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy:
<q>
                     <l>

                  </q> The poet now proceeds to ſupport
the principles of his Philoſophy by <hi>examples:</hi> But before we come to theſe, it will be
neceſſary to look back upon the general ceconomy of the poem.</p>
               <p>In the firſt part [to ℣ 109.] the <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>abuſe</hi> of Riches are <hi>ſatyrically</hi> delivered in
<hi>precept.</hi> From thence, to ℣ 177. the cauſes of the abuſe are <hi>philoſophically</hi> inquired
into: And from thence to the end, the <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>abuſe</hi> are <hi>hiſtorically</hi> illuſtrated in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</hi>
Where we may obſerve, that the concluſion of the <hi>firſt</hi> part, concerning the
Miſer's cruelty to others, naturally introduces the <hi>ſecond,</hi> by a ſatyrical apology, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he is full as cruel to himſelf: The explanation of which extraordinary phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon
brings the author into the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of his ſubject; and this ending in an
obſervation of Avarice and Profuſion's correcting and reconciling one another, as
naturally introduces the <hi>third,</hi> which proves the truth of the obſervation from <hi>fact.</hi>
And thus the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of his <hi>ſubject</hi> ſtanding between his <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Examples,</hi>
gives ſtrength and light to both, and receives it reflected back again from both.</p>
               <p>He firſt gives us two examples [from ℣ 176 to 219.] of theſe oppoſite <hi>ruling Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi>
and (to ſee them in their full force) taken from <hi>ſubjects,</hi> as he tells us, <hi>not void

of <hi>Manner</hi> in the preference here given to the <hi>Man of Roſs.</hi> The purpoſe of the
poet is to ſhew, that an <hi>immenſe</hi> fortune is not wanted for all the good that Riches are
capable of doing; he therefore chuſes ſuch an inſtance, as proves, that a man with
five hundred pounds a year could become a bleſſing to a whole country; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
that the poet's precepts for the <hi>true uſe of money,</hi> are of more <hi>general</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
than a bad heart will give an indifferent head leave to conceive. This was a truth
of the greateſt importance to inculcate: He therefore [from ℣ 249 to 297.] exalts the
character of a <hi>very private</hi> man, one Mr. J. Kyrle, of Herefordſhire: And, in end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his deſcription, ſtruck as it were with admiration at a ſublimity of his own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and warmed with ſentiments of a Gratitude he had raiſed in himſelf in behalf of
the public, the poet burſts out,
<q>

Then, tranſported with indignation at a contrary object, he exclaims,

And this he illuſtrates [from ℣ 299 to 339.] in deſcribing the unhappy deaths of the
laſt Villers, Duke of Buckingham, and Sir J. Cutler; whoſe profuſion and avarice he
has beautifully contraſted. The miſerable end of theſe two extraordinary perſons na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
leads the poet into this humane reflexion, however ludicrouſly expreſſed,
<q>

                     </l>
                  </q>
And now, as if fully determined to reſolve this doubtful queſtion, he aſſumes the air
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1230800300:70"/>
and importance of a Profeſſor ready addreſs'd to plunge himſelf into the very depths of
theology:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>A knotty point! to which we now proceed —</hi>

                     </l>
                  </q>
And thus, by the moſt eaſy tranſition, we are come to the <hi>concluding doctrine</hi> of his

and avarice having been given to ſhew, that miſapplied wealth was <hi>not enjoyed,</hi> it
only remained to prove, that in ſuch circumſtances wealth became the <hi>heavieſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi>;
and this was the very point to be concluded with, as the great MORAL of
this inſtructive poem; which is to teach us, <hi>how miſerable men make themſelves by not
endeavouring to reſtrain the ruling Paſſion, tho' it be indeed implanted in the conſtitution
of things</hi>; while, at the ſame time it is an anſwer to the latter part of the queſtion,

For the ſolution of which only, this example was jocularly pretended to have been given.</p>
               <p>All this the poet has admirably ſupported, in the artful conſtruction of his fable of
Sir Balaam, whoſe character is ſo drawn, as to let the reader ſee he had it in his power
to regulate the <hi>ruling Paſſion</hi> by reaſon, as having in himſelf the ſeeds of Integrity,
Religion, and Sobriety. Theſe are gradually worked out by an inſatiable <hi>thirſt of
Wealth</hi>; and this again (thro' a falſe ſenſe of his own abilities in acquiring it) ſucceeded
by as immoderate a <hi>Vanity.</hi> Let me only obſerve farther, that the author, in this <hi>Tale,</hi>
has artfully ſummed up and recapitulated thoſe three principal miſchiefs in the <hi>abuſe</hi> of
money, which the <hi>ſatyrical</hi> part of this poem throughout was employed to expoſe,
namely, AVARICE, PROFUSION, and PUBLIC CORRUPTION.</p>

Eſq. Member of Parliament, being

and convicted of Forgery, was firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1230800300:46"/>
the Houſe, and then ſtood in the
Pillory on the 17th of March 1727. He
was ſuſpected of joining in a conveyance
with Sir John Blunt, to ſecrete fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds of that Director's Eſtate,
forfeited to the South Sea company by
Act of Parliament. The Company re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the fifty thouſand pounds againſt
Ward; but he ſet up prior convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of his real eſtate to his brother
and ſon, and conceal'd all his perſonal,
which was computed to be one hundred
and fifty thouſand pounds: Theſe convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
being alſo ſet aſide by a bill in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
Ward was impriſoned, and hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the forfeiture of his life, by not giving
in his effects till the laſt day, which was
that of his examination. During his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinement,
his amuſement was to give poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to dogs and cats, and ſee them expire
by flower or quicker torments. To ſum
up the <hi>worth</hi> of this gentleman, at the

               <p>FR. CHARTRES, a man infamous for
all manner of vices. When he was an
enſign in the army, he was drumm'd out
of the regiment for a cheat; he was next
baniſh'd Bruſſels, and drumm'd out of
Ghent on the ſame account. After a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
tricks at the gaming-tables, he took
to lending of money at exorbitant intereſt
and on great penalties, accumulating pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium,
intereſt, and capital into a new
capital, and ſeizing to a minute when the
payments became due; in a word, by a
conſtant attention to the vices, wants,
and follies of mankind, he acquired an
immenſe fortune. His houſe was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
bawdy-houſe. He was twice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
for rapes, and pardoned; but the
laſt time not without impriſonment in
Newgate, and large confiſcations. He
died in Scotland in 1731, aged 62. The
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1230800300:47"/>
populace at his funeral rais'd a great riot,
almoſt tore the body out of the coffin, and

            <head>EPISTLE IV.</head>

               <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
               <head>Of the USE of RICHES.</head>
               <p>The Vanity of Expence in People of Wealth and Quality. The abuſe of the
word <hi>Taſte,</hi> ℣ 13. That the firſt principle and foundation, in this as in
every thing elſe, is <hi>Good Senſe,</hi> ℣ 40. The chief proof of it is to <hi>follow
Nature,</hi> even in works of mere Luxury and Elegance. Inſtanced in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture</hi>
and <hi>Gardening,</hi> where all muſt be adapted to the <hi>Genius</hi> and
<hi>Uſe</hi> of the <hi>Place,</hi> and the Beauties not forced into it, but reſulting from
it, ℣ 50. How men are diſappointed in their moſt expenſive undertakings,
for want of this true Foundation, without which nothing can pleaſe <hi>long,</hi>
if <hi>at all</hi>; and the beſt <hi>Examples</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> will but be perverted into
ſomething <hi>burdenſome</hi> or ridiculous, ℣ 65, &amp;c. <hi>to</hi> 92. A deſcription of
the <hi>falſe Taſte</hi> of <hi>Magnificence</hi>; the firſt grand Error of which is to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that <hi>Greatneſs</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>Size</hi> and <hi>Dimenſion,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi>
and <hi>Harmony</hi> of the <hi>whole,</hi> ℣ 97. and the ſecond, either in join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together <hi>Parts incoherent,</hi> or too <hi>minutely reſembling,</hi> or in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition</hi>
of the <hi>ſame</hi> too frequently, ℣ 105, &amp;c. A word or two of falſe
Taſte in <hi>Books,</hi> in <hi>Muſic,</hi> in <hi>Painting,</hi> even in <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and
laſtly in <hi>Entertainments,</hi> ℣ 133, &amp;c. Yet <hi>PROVIDENCE</hi> is juſtified in
giving Wealth to be ſquandered in this manner, ſince it is diſperſed to the
Poor and Laborious part of mankind, ℣ 169. [Recurring to what is laid
down in the firſt book, Ep. <hi>ii.</hi> and in the Epiſtle preceding this, ℣ 159, &amp;c.]
What are the <hi>proper Objects</hi> of Magnificence, and a proper field for the
Expence of <hi>Great Men,</hi> ℣ 177, &amp;c. and finally, the Great and Public
Works which become a <hi>Prince,</hi> ℣ 191, <hi>to the end.</hi>

               <p>EPISTLE IV.] The extremes of <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Profuſion</hi> being treated of in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Epiſtle; this takes up one particular branch of the latter, the <hi>Vanity of Expence</hi>
in people of Wealth and Quality; and is therefore a corollary to the preceding. It is
equally remarkable for exactneſs of method with the reſt. But the nature of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which is leſs philoſophical, makes it capable of being analyſed in a much nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
compaſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">VER. 1. <l>
                        <hi>'Tis ſtrange, &amp;c.</hi>]</l>
                  </q> The poet's introduction [from ℣ 1 to 39.] conſiſts of
a very curious <hi>remark,</hi> ariſing from his intimate knowledge of nature, together with
an <hi>illuſtration</hi> of it, taken from his obſervations on life. It is this, that the Prodigal
no more <hi>enjoys</hi> his Profuſion, than the Miſer his Rapacity. It was generally thought,
that <hi>Avarice</hi> only <hi>kept</hi> without enjoyment; but the poet here firſt acquaints us with
a circumſtance in human life much more to be lamented, viz. that <hi>Profuſion</hi> too can
<hi>communicate</hi> without it; whereas <hi>Enjoyment</hi> was thought to be as peculiarly the reward
of the <hi>beneficent</hi> paſſions (of which this ſeems to have the appearance) as <hi>want</hi> of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
was the puniſhment of the <hi>ſelfiſh.</hi>—The phaenomenon obſerved is odd enough.
But if we look more narrowly into this matter, we ſhall find, that Prodigality, when
in purſuit of <hi>Taſte,</hi> is only a <hi>Mode of Vanity,</hi> and conſequently as ſelfiſh a paſſion as even
Avarice itſelf, and it is of the ordonance and conſtitution of all ſelfiſh paſſions, when
growing to exceſs, to defeat their own end, which is <hi>Self-enjoyment.</hi> But beſides the
accurate philoſophy of this obſervation, there is a fine <hi>Morality</hi> contained in it; namely
that <hi>ill-got</hi> Wealth is not only as unreaſonably, but as <hi>uncomfortably</hi> ſquandered as it
was raked together; which the poet himſelf further inſinuates in ℣ 15.
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>What brought Sir Viſto's</hi> ill-got wealth <hi>to waſte —</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
He then illuſtrates this obſervation by divers examples in every branch of <hi>wrong Taſte</hi>;
and to ſet their abſurdities in the ſtrongeſt light, he, in concluſion, contraſts them
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1230800300:80"/>
with ſeveral inſtances of the <hi>true,</hi> in the noble Lord to whom the Epiſtle is addreſſed.
This diſpoſition is productive of various beauties: for, by this means, the <hi>Introduction</hi>
becomes an <hi>epitome</hi> of the body of the Epiſtle; which, as we ſhall ſee, conſiſts of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
reflections on <hi>Taſte,</hi> and particular examples of <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>good.</hi> And his
friend's Example concluding the Introduction, leads the poet gracefully into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
itſelf; for this Lord, here celebrated for his good Taſte, was now at hand
to deliver the firſt and fundamental percept of it himſelf, which gives authority
and dignity to all that follow.</p>

                  <p>The firſt part of it, [from ℣ 38 to 95.] delivers rules for attaining to the MAGNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICENT
in juſt expence; which is the ſame in Building and Planting, that the SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIME
is in Painting and Poetry; and, conſequently, the qualities neceſſary for the
attainment of both muſt have the ſame relation.</p>
                  <p>1. The firſt and <hi>fundamental,</hi> he ſhews [from ℣ 38 to 47.] to be SENSE.<q>
                        <l>Good Senſe<hi>, which only is the gift of Heav'n,</hi>

                        </l>
                     </q> And for <hi>that</hi> reaſon; not only as it is the foundation and parent of them all, and the
conſtant regulator and director of their operations, or, as the poet better expreſſes it,
<hi>— of every Art the Soul</hi>; but likewiſe as it alone can, in caſe of need, very often
ſupply the offices of every one of them.</p>

                     </q> 2. The next quality, for dignity and uſe, is
TASTE, and but the next: For, as the poet truly obſerves, there is <hi>— ſomething
previous ev'n to Taſte — 'tis Senſe</hi>; and this, in the order of things: For <hi>Senſe</hi> is a taſte
and true conception of <hi>Nature</hi>; and <hi>Taſte</hi> is a ſenſe or true conception of <hi>beautiful
Nature</hi>; but we muſt firſt know the <hi>Eſſences</hi> of things, before we can judge truly of
their <hi>Qualities.</hi> The buſineſs of <hi>Taſte,</hi> therefore, in the purſuit of <hi>Magnificence,</hi> is,
as the poet ſhews us [from ℣ 46 to 65.] 1. [to ℣ 51.] to catch or lay hold on <hi>Nature,</hi>
where ſhe appears moſt in her charms. 2. [to ℣ 57.] To adorn her, when taken, as
beſt ſuits her dignity and quality; that is, to dreſs her in the light and modeſt habit of
a virgin, not load her with the gaudy ornaments of a proſtitute. This rule obſerved,
will prevent a tranſgreſſion in the following, which is, not to let all its beauties be
ſeen at once, but in ſucceſſion; for that advantage is inſeparable from a graceful and
well-dreſſed perſon. 3. [to ℣ 65.] To take care that the ornaments be well ſuited to
<hi>that part,</hi> which it is your purpoſe to adorn; and, as in dreſſing out a <hi>modeſt Fair,</hi>
(which is the poet's own compariſion) the colours are proportioned to her complexion;
the ſtuff, to the embonpoint of her perſon; and the faſhion, to her air and ſhape;
ſo in ornamenting a villa, <hi>the riſe or fall of waters</hi> ſhould correſpond to its acclivities
or declivities; the <hi>artificial hills or vales</hi> to its cover or expoſure; and the manner of
<hi>calling in the country</hi> to the diſpoſition of its aſpect. But again, as in the illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whatever be the variety in colour, ſtuff, or faſhion, they muſt ſtill be ſo ſuited
with reſpect to one another, as to produce an agreement and harmony in their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage;
ſo woods, waters, mountains, vales, and viſtas muſt, amidſt all their diverſity,
be ſo diſpoſed with a relation to each other, as to create a perfect ſymmetry reſulting
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1230800300:85"/>
from the whole; and this, the <hi>Genius</hi> of the place, when religiouſly conſulted, will
never fail to inform us of; who, as the poet ſays,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Now breaks, and now directs th' intending lines,</hi>

                        </l>
                     </q>
And this is a full and complete deſcription of the <hi>office of Taſte.</hi>

                     </q> But now when <hi>good Senſe</hi> has led us up to <hi>Taſte,</hi>
our fondneſs for the elegances of our new miſtreſs, oftentimes occaſions us to neglect
the plainneſs and ſimplicity of the old; we are but too apt to forſake our Guide, and to
give ourſelves up ſolely to <hi>Taſte.</hi> Our author's next rule therefore 3. is, <hi>ſtill to follow

That is, <hi>Good Senſe</hi> ſhould never be a moment abſent from the works of <hi>Taſte,</hi> any more

                     </q> The particular advantages of the union of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1230800300:87"/>
Senſe with Taſte he then explains [from this verſe to 71.] 1. That the beautiful parts
which <hi>Taſte</hi> has laid out and contrived, <hi>Senſe</hi> makes to anſwer one another, and to <hi>ſlide</hi>
naturally, without violence, <hi>into a whole.</hi> 2. That many beauties will <hi>ſpontaneouſly offer</hi>
themſelves, ſuggeſted from the very neceſſity which <hi>Senſe</hi> lays upon us, of conforming
the parts to the whole, that no original invention of <hi>Taſte</hi> would have ſupplied. 3. A
third advantage is, that you are then always ſure to have <hi>Nature on your ſide,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>

                        </l>
                     </q>
The expreſſion is important — <hi>Senſe</hi> being a right conception of <hi>Nature</hi>; and <hi>Taſte</hi> a
right conception of <hi>beautiful Nature</hi>; when theſe are in conjunction, Nature can
ſtand out no longer, but preſents herſelf to you without further pains or ſearch.</p>

                     </q> To illuſtrate this doctrine, the poet
next ſhews us [from ℣ 70 to 99.] that without this continued ſupport of <hi>Good Senſe,</hi>
things even of the <hi>higheſt Taſte</hi> and <hi>utmoſt Magnificence,</hi> ſuch as the Buildings of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles,</hi>
the Gardens of <hi>Villario,</hi> and the Groves of <hi>Sabinus</hi> (which are the inſtances
he gives) all, in a very little time, come to nothing. — And no wonder. For the
exerciſe of <hi>Taſte</hi> WITHOUT SENSE is, where ſomething that is <hi>not beautiful Nature</hi> is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1230800300:88"/>
miſtaken for it, and <hi>ornamented</hi> as beautiful Nature ſhould be: Theſe ornaments, there
fore, being deſtitute of all real ſupport, muſt be continually ſubject to change. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the owner himſelf will grow weary of them (as in the caſe of <hi>Villario</hi>) and find
at laſt, that <hi>Nature</hi> is to be preferred before them,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Tir'd of the ſcene</hi> Parterres <hi>and</hi> Fountains <hi>yield,</hi>

                     </q>
Sometimes, again, the Heir (like <hi>Sabinus</hi>'s) will be changing a bad Taſte for a worſe,

So that <hi>mere Taſte</hi> ſtanding expoſed between the true and <hi>falſe,</hi> like the decent man,

The imagery is here taken from <hi>Painting,</hi>
in the judicious execution of the <hi>Pencil,</hi>

To underſtand what is meant by <hi>ſupporting</hi>
(which is a term of art common both to
<hi>Planting</hi> and <hi>Painting</hi>) we muſt conſider
what things make the natural defect or
weakneſs of a rude uncultivated <hi>Plain</hi>; and
theſe are, the having a diſagreable flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the not having a <hi>proper termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
But a <hi>Wood,</hi> rightly diſpoſed, takes
away the one, and gives what is wanting
of the other.<q>

                        <hi>— The parts unite.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q> The utmoſt which art can do, when it does
its full office, is to give the work a <hi>conſent</hi>
of parts; but it is <hi>time</hi> only that can
make the <hi>union</hi> here ſpoken of, there
being the ſame difference between theſe,
as between a ſimple <hi>Contract,</hi> and a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation.</hi>
So in painting, the ſkill
of the <hi>maſter</hi> can go no further, in the
chromatic part, than to ſet thoſe colours
together, which have a natural friendſhip
and ſympathy for each other: But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                  </q> And now the work becomes a <hi>very</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
which the poet informs us of, in

by ſetting that picture before our eyes;

one, in which the lights and ſhades, not
only bear a <hi>proportion</hi> to one another
in their force (which is implied in the

<hi>height</hi> (which the word <hi>ſtrength</hi> ſignifies.)

as a toad, or dead carcaſe in wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work:
yet theſe things are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of all people of bad Taſte. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the Ornament itſelf pretends to
ſcience, and would juſtify its uſe by
antiquity, tho' it betrays the moſt miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ignorance of it. The <hi>Serpent,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the ancients, was ſacred, and full
of venerable myſteries. Now things do
not excite ideas ſo much according to their
own natural impreſſions, as by fictitious
ones, ariſing from foreign and accidental
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1230800300:95"/>
combinations; conſequently the view of
this animal raiſed in them nothing of that
abhorrence which it is wont to do in us;
but, on the contrary, very agreeable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
correſpondent to thoſe foreign aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations.
Hence, and more eſpecially
becauſe the Serpent was the peculiar <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol
of health,</hi> it became an extreme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ornament to the <hi>genial rooms</hi> of the
ancients: While we, who are ſtrangers to
all this ſuperſtition, yet make ourſelves
liable to one much more abſurd, which is,
idolizing the very <hi>faſhions</hi> that aroſe from
it. But if theſe pretenders to Taſte can
ſo widely miſtake, it is no wonder that
thoſe who pretend to none, I mean the
verbal Critics, ſhould a little <hi>hallucinate</hi>
in this matter. I remember, when the
ſhort Latin inſcription on Shakeſpear's
monument was firſt ſet up, and in the
very ſtyle of elegant and ſimple anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
the News-papers were full of theſe
ſmall Critics; in which, the only obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
that looked like learning, was
founded in this ignorance of Taſte and
Antiquity. One of theſe Critics objected
to the word <hi>Mors</hi> (in the inſcription)
becauſe the Roman writers of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
times ſcrupled to employ it; but,
in its ſtead, uſed an improper, that is, a
figurative word, or otherwiſe a circumlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
But had he conſider'd that it was
their Superſtition of <hi>lucky</hi> and <hi>unlucky words</hi>
which occaſion'd this delicacy, he muſt
have ſeen that a Chriſtian writer, in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

in avoiding ſo ſenſeleſs an affectation of,
what he miſcalls, claſſical expreſſion.</p>

The art of this can never be ſufficiently
