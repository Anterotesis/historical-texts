            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT would be very flattering to me, if I might hope that the little Tale, which I now take the liberty of preſenting to you, could amuſe a few moments of your tedious indiſpoſition. It is, I confeſs, but a paltry return for the many hours of agreeable information, and elegant amuſement, which I have received from your ſpirited and very entertaining writings: yet
<pb facs="tcp:0134303500:3"/>
I am perſuaded, that you will receive it with favour, as a ſmall offering of eſteem and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, of which the intention alone makes all the little value.</p>
            <p>The ſlight verſes, Sir, which I place under your protection, will not, I fear, impreſs the world with a very favourable idea of my poetical powers: But I ſhall, at leaſt, be ſuſpected of having ſome taſte, and of keeping good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, when I confeſ s that ſome of the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hours of my life have been paſſed in your converſation. I ſhould be unjuſt to your very engaging and well-bred turn of wit, if I did not declare that, among all the lively and brilliant things I have heard from you, I do not remember ever to have heard an unkind, or an ungenerous one: Let me be allowed to bear my feeble teſtimony to your temperate uſe of this charming faculty, ſo delightful in

                  <p>THE following Trifle owes its birth and name to the miſtake of a Foreigner of Diſtinction, who gave the literal appellation of the <hi>Bas-bleu,</hi> to a ſmall party of friends, who had been ſometimes called, by way of pleaſantry, the Blue Stockings. The ſlight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, occaſioned by this little circumſtance, was never intended to appear in print: It is, in general, too local, and too perſonal for publication; and was only written with a wiſh to amuſe the amiable Lady to whom it is addreſſed, and a few partial friends. But copies having been multiplied, far beyond the intention of the Author, ſhe has been adviſed to publiſh it, leſt it ſhould ſteal into the world in a ſtate of ſtill greater imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though ſhe is almoſt aſhamed to take refuge in ſo hackneyed an apology, however true.</p>
