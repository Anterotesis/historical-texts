            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Two former Volumes of <hi>PAMELA</hi>; or, <hi>VIRTUE REWARDED,</hi> met with a Succeſs greatly exceeding the moſt ſanguine Expectations: And the Editor hopes, that the Letters which compoſe theſe, will be found equally written to <hi>NATURE,</hi> avoiding all romantick Flights, improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Surprizes, and irrational Machinery; and that the Paſſions are touched, where requiſite, and Rules, equally <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Practicable,</hi> inculcated throughout the Whole, for the <hi>General Conduct of Life</hi>: And, therefore he flatters himſelf, that they may expect the good Fortune, which few <hi>Continuations</hi> have met with, to be judg'd not unworthy the Firſt nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion'd
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0272600703:3"/>
to the more exalted Condition in which <hi>PAMELA</hi> was deſtin'd to ſhine, as an affectionate <hi>Wife,</hi> a faithful <hi>Friend,</hi> a polite and kind <hi>Neighbour,</hi> an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Mother,</hi> and a beneficent <hi>Miſtreſs;</hi> after having in the Two former Volumes ſupported the Character of a dutiful <hi>Child,</hi> a ſpotleſs <hi>Virgin,</hi> and a modeſt and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reader will eaſily ſee, that, in ſo great a Choice of Materials, as muſt ariſe from a Multitude of important Subjects, in a married Life; to ſuch Genius's and Friendſhips as thoſe of Mr. and Mrs, <hi>B.</hi> the Editor's greateſt Difficulty was, how to bring them within the Compaſs which he was determined not to exceed. And it having been left to his own Choice, in what manner to digeſt and publiſh the Letters, and where to cloſe the Work, he had intended, at firſt, in regard to his other Avocations, end ſome Deſigns of
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0272600703:4"/>
another Nature in which he was engaged, to have carry'd the Piece no farther than the Two former Volumes; as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the'd from the Concluſion of the Firſt-Five Editions.</p>
            <p>It may be expected, therefore, that he ſhould enter into an Explanation of the Reaſons whereby he was provoked into a Neceſſity of altering his Intention. But he is willing to decline ſaying Any-thing upon ſo well-known a Subject; leſt his Intereſt might appear more concern'd, than the Satisfaction of the Publick.</p>
            <p>The Editor has been much preſs'd with Importunities and Conjectures in relation to the Perſon and Family of the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lady, who is the Subject of theſe Volumes: All that he thinks himſelf at Liberty to ſay, or is neceſſary to be ſaid, is only to repeat what has been already hinted, That the Story has its Foundation in
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0272600703:5"/>
Truth: That the moſt material Incidents (as will be collected from ſeveral Paſſages in the Letters) happen'd between the Years <hi>1717</hi> and <hi>1730:</hi> And that there was a Neceſſity, for obvious Reaſons, to vary and diſguiſe ſome Facts and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as alſo the Names of Perſons, Places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E arrived here laſt Night, highly pleaſed with our Journey, and the Occaſion of it, May God bleſs you both with long Life and Health, to enjoy your ſweet Farm, and pretty Dwelling, which is juſt what I wiſhed it to be. And don't make your grateful Hearts too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy in the Poſſeſſion of it, by your modeſt Diffidence of your own Worthineſs: For, at the ſame time that it is what will do Honour to the beſt of Gentlemen,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0272600703:7"/>
it is not ſo <hi>very</hi> extraordinary, conſidering his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as that it will give any one Cauſe to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it as the Effect of a too partial and injudicious Kindneſs for the Parents of one whom he <hi>delighteth to honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My dear Maſter (why ſhould I not ſtill call him ſo, bound to reverence him as I am, in every Light that he can ſhine in to the moſt obliged and ſenſible Heart?) holds his kind Purpoſe of fitting up the large Parlour and three Apartments in the commodious Dwelling he calls yours, for his Entertainment and mine, when he ſhall permit me to pay my Duty to you both, for a few happy Days together; and he has actually given Orders for that Purpoſe; and that the three Apartments be ſo fitted up, as to be rather ſuitable to <hi>your</hi> Condition, than his <hi>own</hi>; for, he ſays, the plain ſimple Elegance which he will have to be obſerved in the Rooms as well as the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will be a Variety in his Retirement to this Place, that will make him return to his own with the greater Pleaſure; and at the ſame time, when we are not there, will be of Uſe for the Reception of any of your Friends; and ſo he ſhall not, as he kindly ſays, rob the good Couple of any of their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations.</p>
               <p>The old Bow-windows he will have preſerv'd, but will not have them ſaſh'd, nor the Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binds, Jeſſamines and Vines that run up againſt them, deſtroyed; only he will have larger Panes of Glaſs, and convenienter Caſements, to let in more of the ſweet Air and Light, to make amends for that obſtructed by the Shades of thoſe fragrant Climbers. For he has mention'd three or four times, how gratefully they diſpens'd their intermingled Odours to us, when, the laſt Evening, we ſtood at the Window in our Bed-chamber, to hear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſive
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0272600703:8"/>
Songs of two warbling Nightingales, one at a Diſtance, the other near, which took up our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted Attention for above two Hours, and charm'd us the more, as we thought their Seaſon had been over. And when they had done, he made <hi>me</hi> ſing him one, and called me for it, the ſweeteſt of all Nightingales, ſaying, How greatly do the innocent Pleaſures I now hourly taſte, exceed the guilty Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults that uſed formerly to agitate my unequal Mind! Never talk, my <hi>Pamela,</hi> as you frequently do, of Obligation to me: One ſuch Hour as I now enjoy, is an ample Reward for all the Benefits I can confer on you and yours in my whole Life!</p>
               <p>The Parlour indeed will be more elegant, tho' that is to be rather plain than rich, as well in its Wainſcot as Furniture, and to be new floor'd. The dear Gentleman has already given Orders about it, and you will ſoon have Workmen with you to put them in Execution. The Parlour Doors are to have Braſs Hinges and Locks, and to ſhut as cloſe, he tells them, as a Watch-caſe: For who knows, ſaid he, my Dear, but we ſhall have ſtill added Bleſſings, in two or three charming Boys and Girls, to place there in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, before they can be of Age to be benefited by your Leſſons and Example? And beſides, I make no doubt, but I ſhall entertain there ſome of my choſen Friends, in their Excurſions, for a Day or ſo.</p>
               <p>How am I, every Hour of my Life, overwhelm'd with Inſtances of God Almighty's Goodneſs and his! — O ſpare, bleſſed Father of Mercies, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Life of this excellent Gentleman! and increaſe my Thankfulneſs, and my Worthineſs; and then— But what ſhall I ſay?—Only that then I may <hi>continue</hi> to be what I am; for more bleſs'd and more happy, in my own Mind, ſurely I cannot be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0272600703:9"/>The Beds he will have of Cloth, becauſe he thinks the Situation a little cold, eſpecially when the Wind is Eaſterly, and becauſe he purpoſes to be down in the early Spring Seaſon now-and-then, as well as in the latter Autumn; and the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Curtains of the ſame, in one Room red, in the other green; but plain, leſt you ſhould be afraid to uſe them occaſionally. The Carpets for them will come down with the other Furniture; for he will nor alter the old Oaken Floors of the Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor yet of the little Room he intends for my Uſe, to withdraw to, when I chuſe not to join in ſuch Company as may happen to fall in: Which, my Dear, ſays he, ſhall be as little as is poſſible, only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friends, who may be diſpoſed once in a Year or two, to ſee, when I am there, how I live with my <hi>Pamela,</hi> and her Parents, and how I paſs my Time in my Retirement, as I ſhall call this: For otherwiſe, perhaps, they will be apt to think I am aſham'd of Company I ſhall always be pleaſed with.—Nor are you, my Dear, continued he, to take this as a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to yourſelf, but a Piece of requiſite Policy in me; for who will offer to reproach me for marrying, as the World thinks, below me, when they ſhall ſee, that ſuch a Reproach, as they would intend it, is ſo far from being ſo to me, that every Day of my Life, I not only pride myſelf in my <hi>Pamela,</hi> but take Pleaſure in owning her Relations as mine, and viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and receiving Viſits from them; and yet offer not to ſet them up in ſuch a glaring Light, as if I would have the World forget (who in that Caſe would always take the more Pleaſure in remembering) what they were? And how will it anticipate low Reflection, when they ſhall ſee, I can bend my Mind to partake with them the Pleaſures of their humble, but decent Life?—Ay, continued he, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0272600703:10"/>
be rewarded for it too, with better Health, better Spirits, and a better Mind; ſo that, my Dear, added he, I ſhall reap more Benefit by what I propoſe to do, than I ſhall confer.</p>
               <p>In this generous manner does this beſt of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men endeavour to diſclaim tho' I muſt be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, if, with me, it did not inhance the proper Merit of a Beneficence that is natural to him; and which indeed, as I tell him, may be in one reſpect depreciated, inaſmuch as (ſo excellent is his Nature) he cannot help it, if he would.—O that it was in my Power to recompenſe him for it! But I am poor, as I have often ſaid, in every thing but Will — and that is <hi>wholly</hi> his: — And what a Happineſs is it to me, a <hi>Happineſs</hi> I could not ſo early have hoped for, that I can ſay ſo without <hi>Reſerve</hi>; ſince the dear Gentleman requires nothing of me, but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with my Duty to the ſupreme Benefactor, the firſt Mover and Cauſe of all his own Happineſs, of my Happineſs, and of that of my dear, my ever dear Parents!</p>
               <p>But whither does the inchanting Subject lead me! I am running on to my uſual Length, tho' I have not the ſame Excuſe for it; for heretofore I had nothing to do but to write. Yet, I am ſure, if I do exceed a little, <hi>you</hi> will be pleaſed with it; and you have moreover a Right to rejoice with me in the Days of my Felicity, after your indulgent Hearts had been ſo much pained by a long Succeſſion of my Fears and my Dangers, which only ought to be remember'd now, as Subjects of thankful Exultation, by</p>

               <p>I Need not repeat to you the Senſe your good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and I have of our Happineſs, and of our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to your honoured Spouſe: You both were pleaſed Witneſſes of it every Hour of the happy Fortnight you paſſed with us. But ſtill, my Dear, we hardly know how to addreſs ourſelves even to <hi>You,</hi> much leſs to the <hi>'Squire,</hi> with the Freedom he ſo often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited us to take: For, I don't know how it is, but tho' you are our Daughter, and are ſo far from being lifted up by your high Condition, that we ſee no Difference in your Behaviour to us your poor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; yet, when we look upon you as the Lady of ſo fine a Gentleman, we cannot forbear having a kind of Reſpect, and — I don't know what to call it,— that lays a little Reſtraint upon us! And yet we would not, methinks, let our Minds be run away with the Admiration of worldly Grandeur, ſo, as to ſet too much by it.</p>
               <p>But your Merit, and your Prudence, my dear Daughter, is ſo much above all we could ever have any Notion of it:—And to have Gentry come only to behold you, and admire you, not ſo much for your Genteelneſs and Amiableneſs neither, as for your Behaviour, and your Affability to Poor as well as Rich, and to hear every one calling you an Angel, and ſaying, you <hi>deſerve</hi> to be what you are; makes us hardly know how to look upon you but as an Angel indeed! I am ſure you have been a good Angel to us!—Since, for your ſake, God Almighty has put it into your honour'd Husband's Heart, to make us the happieſt Couple in the World: But little

leſs, indeed, we ſhould have been, had we only, in ſome far diſtant Land, heard of our dear Child's Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and never partaken of the Benefits of it our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But thus to be provided for!—Thus kindly to be owned, and called Father and Mother by ſuch a brave Gentleman, and thus to be placed, that we have nothing to do, but to bleſs God, and bleſs him, and bleſs you, and hourly pray for you <hi>both,</hi> is ſuch a Providence, my dear Child, as is too mighty to be borne by us, with Equalneſs of Temper; and we kneel together every Morning, Noon and Night, and weep and rejoice, and rejoice and weep, to think how our Unworthineſs is diſtinguiſhed, and how God has provided for us in our latter Days, when all we had to fear, was, that as we grew older and more infirm, and worn out by hard Labour, we ſhould be troubleſome, where, not our Pride, but our induſtrious Wills, would have made us wiſh not to be ſo;—but to be intitled to a happier Lot: For this would have grieved us the more, for the ſake of you, my dear Child, and your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Brother's Children; for it is well known, that, tho' we pretend not to boaſt of our Family, and indeed had no Reaſon, yet none of us were ever ſunk ſo low as I was:—To be ſure, partly by my own Fault; for had it been for your poor aged Mother's ſake only, I ought not to have done what I did for <hi>John</hi> and <hi>William</hi>; for, ſo unhappy were they, poor Lads, that what I could do, was but as a Drop of Water to a Bucket.</p>
               <p>But yet the Iſſue has ſhewn, that (if I may preſume to ſay ſo) what I did, was not diſpleaſing to God; inaſmuch as I have the Comfort to ſee, that my Reliance on Him, while I was doing what though ſome thought <hi>imprudent</hi> Things, yet not <hi>wrong</hi> Things, is ſo abundantly rewarded, beyond
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0272600703:13"/>
Expectation and Deſert. Bleſſed be his holy Name for it!</p>
               <p>You command me—Let me, as writing to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Lady, ſay <hi>command,</hi> tho', as to my dear <hi>Daughter,</hi> I will only ſay <hi>deſire</hi>: And indeed I will not, as you wiſh'd me not to do, let the one Condition, which was accidental, put the other, which was natural, out of my Thought: You ſpoke it in better Words, but this was the Senſe — But you have the Gift of Utterance; and Education is a fine thing, where it meets with ſuch Talents to improve upon as God has given you.—But let me not forget what I was going to ſay — You <hi>command</hi> — or, if you pleaſe—you deſire me to write long Letters, and often—And how can I help it, if I would? For when here, in this happy Dwelling, and this well-ſtock'd Farm, in theſe rich Meadows, and well-cropt Acres, we look around us, and, which Way ſoever we turn our Heads, ſee Bleſſings upon Bleſſings, and Plenty upon Plenty; ſee Barns well-ſtor'd, Poultry increaſing, the Kine lowing and crouding about us, and all fruitful; and are bid to call all theſe our own—And then think; that all is the Reward of our Child's Virtue!—O my dear Daughter, who can bear theſe Things!—Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me—I muſt break off a little, for my Eyes are as full as my Heart; and I will retire to bleſs God and your honoured Husband.</p>
               <p>So—my dear Child—I now again take up my Pen —But reading what I had written, in order to carry on the Thread, I can hardly forbear again being in like ſort affected.—But do you think I will call all theſe Things my own!—Do you think I will live Rent-free!—Do you think I would? Can the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured 'Squire believe, that having ſuch a generous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0272600703:14"/>
Example before me, if I had no Gratitude in my Temper before, I could help being touched by ſuch an one as he ſets me?—If his Goodneſs makes him know no Mean in giving, ſhall I be ſo greedy as to know none in receiving?—Come, come, my dear Child, your poor Father is not ſo ſordid a Wretch neither. He will ſhew the World, that all theſe Benefits are not thrown away upon one, who will diſgrace you as much by his Temper, as by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: What tho' I cannot be as worthy of all theſe Favours as I wiſh? I will be as worthy as I can. And let me tell you, my dear Child, if the King and his Royal Family (God bleſs 'em!) be not aſhamed to receive Taxes and Duties from his Subjects; if Dukes and Earls, and all the top Gentry, cannot ſupport their Bravery, without having their Rents paid; I hope I ſhall not affront the 'Squire, to pay to his Steward, what any other Perſon would pay for this noble Stock and improving Farm: And I will do it, an' it pleaſe God to bleſs me with Life and Health.— I ſhould not be worthy to crawl on the Earth, if I did not. And what did I ſay to Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> the faithful Mr. <hi>Longman</hi>? ſure no Gentleman had ever a more worthy Steward than he: It was as we were walking over the Grounds together—and obſerving in what good Order every thing was; he was praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome little Contrivances of my own, for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Farm, and ſaying how comfortably he hoped we might live upon it. Ay, Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> ſaid I, comfortably indeed: But do you think I could be properly ſaid to <hi>live,</hi> if I was not to pay as much Rent for it as another?—I can tell you, ſaid he, the 'Squire will not receive any thing from you, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Andrews.</hi>—Why, Man, he has no Occaſion for it: He's worth a Power of Money, beſides a noble and clear Eſtate in Land.—Adsheartlikins, you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0272600703:15"/>
muſt not affront him, I can tell you that: For he's as generous as a Prince where he takes; but he is haſty, and will have his own way.—Why, for that Reaſon, Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> ſaid I, I was thinking to make <hi>you</hi> my Friend. — Make <hi>me</hi> your Friend! You have not a better in the World, to my Power, I can tell you that; nor your Dame neither; for I love ſuch honeſt Hearts: I wiſh my own Brother would let me love him as well; but let that paſs.—What I can do for you, I will, and here's my Hand upon it.</p>
               <p>Well then, ſaid I, it is this: Let me account to you at the Rent Farmer <hi>Dickins</hi> offered, and let me know what the Stock coſt, and what the Crops are valued at; and pay the one as I can, and the other Quarterly; and not let the 'Squire know it till you can't chuſe; and I ſhall be as happy as a Prince; for I doubt not, by God's Bleſſing, to make a comfortable Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of it, beſides.—Why, doſt believe, Goodman <hi>Andrews,</hi> ſaid he, I would do ſuch a thing?—Would not his Honour think, if I hid one thing from him, I might not hide another?—Go to, go to, honeſt Heart, I love thee dearly: But can the 'Squire do too much for his Lady, think'ſt thou? Come, come, (and he jeer'd me ſo, I could not tell what to ſay to him) I wiſh at Bottom there is not ſome Pride in this;—what, I warrant, you would not be too much beholden to his Honour, would you?—No, good Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> ſaid I, — it is not that, I'm ſure. If I have any Pride, it is only, in my dear Child—to whom, under God, all this is owing!—But ſome how or other it ſhall be ſo.</p>
               <p>And ſo, my dear Daughter, I reſolve it ſhall; and it will be, over and above, one of the greateſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to me, to do the good 'Squire Service, as well as to be ſo much benefited and obliged by him.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE ſhew'd your Letter to my Beſt-beloved. —Don't be uneaſy that I have;—for you need not be aſhamed of it, ſince it is my Pride to have ſuch honeſt and grateful Parents: And I'll tell you what he ſaid to it, as the beſt Argument I can uſe why you ſhould not be uneaſy, but enjoy without Pain or Anxiety all the Benefits of your happy Lot.</p>
               <p>Dear, good Souls! ſaid he, how does every thing they ſay, and every thing they write, manifeſt the Worthineſs of their Hearts! No Wonder, <hi>Pamela,</hi> you love and revere ſuch honeſt Minds; for that you would do, were they not your Parents: And tell them, that I am ſo far from having them believe that what I have done for them, is only the Effect of my Affection for their Daughter, that let 'em find out another Couple, as worthy as themſelves, and I will do as much for them. Indeed I would not place them, continued the dear Obliger, in the <hi>ſame</hi> County, becauſe I would wiſh <hi>two</hi> Counties to be bleſt for their ſakes. Tell them, my Dear, that they have a Right to what they enjoy on the foot of their own <hi>proper</hi> Merit; and <hi>bid</hi> them enjoy it as their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: And if there can any thing ariſe, that is more than they themſelves can wiſh for, in the way of Life they chuſe to live, let them look round among their own Relations, where it may be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and communicate to them the like ſolid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for rejoicing in the Situation they are pleaſed with: And do you, my Dear, continued he, ſtill further enable them, as you ſhall judge proper, to gratify their inlarged Hearts, for fear they ſhould deny any Comfort to themſelves, in order to do good to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0272600703:18"/>I could only fly to his generous Boſom, (for this is a Subject which moſt affects me) and, with my Eyes ſwimming in Tears of grateful Joy, and which overflow'd as ſoon as my bold Lips touch'd his dear Face, bleſs God and him with my whole Heart; for ſpeak I could not! — But, almoſt choak'd with my Joy, ſobb'd to him my grateful Acknowledgment— He claſped me in his Arms; and ſaid, How, my Deareſt, do you overpay me for the little I have done for your Parents! If it be thus to be bleſs'd for conferring Benefits ſo inſignificant to a Man of my Fortune, what Joys is it not in the Power of rich Men to give themſelves, whenever they pleaſe!— Foretaſtes, indeed, of thoſe we are bid to hope for; which can ſurely only exceed theſe, as <hi>then</hi> we ſhall be all Intellect, and better fitted to receive them!— 'Tis too much!—too much! ſaid I, in broken Accents:—How am I oppreſſed with the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you give me!—Oh, Sir,—bleſs me more gradually, and more cautiouſly—for I cannot bear it! And indeed, my Heart went flutter, flutter, flutter, at his dear Breaſt, as if it wanted to break its too narrow Priſon, to mingle ſtill more intimately with his own.</p>
               <p>Surely, ſurely, my dear, my beloved Parents, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body's Happineſs is ſo great as mine!—If it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thus from Degree to Degree, and is to be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Hope, the charming Hope, that the dear ſecond Author of your Bleſſings and mine, be the uniformly good as well as the partially kind Man to us, what a Felicity will this be! And if our Prayers ſhall be heard, and we ſhall have the Pleaſure to think, that his Advances in Piety are owing not a little to them, and to the Example God ſhall give us Grace to ſet; then, indeed, may we take the Pride to think, we have repaid his Goodneſs to us, and that we have ſatisfied the Debt, which nothing leſs can diſcharge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0272600703:19"/>Thus, then, do I ſet before you imperfectly, as I am forced to do, the Delight your grateful, your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Hearts give us. I ſay, imperfectly, and well I may; for I might as eaſily paint Sound, as deſcribe the noble, the ſublime Pleaſures that wind up my Affections to even a painful Height of Rapture, on ſuch Occaſions as this: And I deſire, as he often bids <hi>me,</hi> that you will take to yourſelves the Merit of thus delighting us both, and then think with leſs Uneaſineſs of the Obligation you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the beſt of Friends!—And indeed it is but doing Juſtice to his beneficent Temper, to think, that we have given him an Opportunity of exerciſing it, in a way ſo agreeable to it; and I can tell by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his Speech, by the additional Luſtre that it lights up in his Eyes, naturally ſo lively, and by the virtuous Endearments, refined on theſe Occaſions above what Senſe can know, that he has a Pleaſure, a Joy, a Tranſport, in doing what he does of this ſort, that is its own Reward; as every virtuous and noble Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be to a Mind that can be delighted with Virtue for its own ſake, and can find itſelf inlarged by the Power of doing Good to worthy Objects. Even I, my dear Parents, know this by Experience, when I can be an humble Means to make an honeſt Creature happy, tho' not related to myſelf; and yet I am but a Third-hand Diſpenſer, as I have <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol. II. <hi>p.</hi> 388.</note>elſewhere ſaid, of theſe Comforts; and all the Light I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, as I once before obſerved<note place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol. II. <hi>p.</hi> 257.</note>, like that of the Moon, is but borrowed from his ſunny Radiance.</p>
               <p>Forgive me, my dear, my worthy Parents, if my Style on this Subject be raiſed above that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Simplicity which is more ſuited to my humble Talents. But how can I help it? For when the Mind is elevated, ought not the Senſe we have of our Happineſs, to make our Expreſſions ſoar
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0272600703:20"/>
equally? Can the Affections be ſo highly raiſed as mine are on theſe Occaſions, and the Thoughts creep, groveling, like one's ordinary Self? No, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! —Call not this, therefore, the Gift of Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, if it ſhould appear to you in a better Light than it deſerves. It is the Gift of Gratitude! A Gift which makes you and me too, <hi>ſpeak</hi> and <hi>write,</hi> as I hope it will make us <hi>act,</hi> above our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves! —And thus will our Gratitude be the Inſpirer of Joy to our common Benefactor; and his Joy will heighten our Gratitude; and ſo we ſhall proceed, as Cauſe and Effect to each other's Happineſs, to bleſs the dear Gentleman that bleſſes us.—And will it be right then to ſay, you are ſo uneaſy under ſuch (at leaſt as to your Wills) returned and diſcharged Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? God Almighty requires only a thankful Heart for all the Mercies he heaps upon the Children of Men: My dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who, in theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, imitates Divinity, deſires no more:—You <hi>have</hi> this thankful Heart;—yes, you have; and that to ſuch a high Degree of Gratitude, that nobody can exceed you.</p>
               <p>But yet, my dear Parents, when your worthy Minds would be too much affected with your Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſo as to lay you under the Reſtraints you mention, to the dear Gentleman, and, for his ſake, to your dependent Daughter; then let me humbly adviſe you, that you will at ſuch Times, with more particular, more abſtracted Aſpirations, than at others, raiſe your Thoughts upwards, and conſider who it is that gives <hi>him</hi> the Opportunity; and pray for him, and for me; for <hi>him,</hi> that all his future Actions may be of a Piece with this noble Diſpoſition of Mind; for <hi>me,</hi> that I may continue humble, and conſider myſelf bleſt for your ſakes, and in order that I may be, in ſome ſort, a Rewarder in the Hands of Providence of this its dear excellent Agent; and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0272600703:21"/>
then we ſhall look forward all of us with Pleaſure indeed to that State, where there is no Diſtinction of Degree, and where the humble Cottager ſhall be upon a Par with the proudeſt Monarch.</p>
               <p>O my dear, dear Parents! how can you, as in your <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> ſay — May we not be <hi>favoured</hi> now-and-then with a Letter? Call <hi>me</hi> your Daughter, your <hi>Pamela</hi> — I am no Lady to you. — I have more Pleaſure to be called your Comfort, and to be thought to act worthy of the Sentiments with which your Examples, Cautions and Inſtructions have inſpired me, than in any one thing in this Life, my deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Duty to our common Benefactor, the beſt of Gentlemen and Husbands, excepted. And I am ſure, God has bleſſed me for your ſakes, and has thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered for me all your Prayers; nay, <hi>more</hi> than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all you or I could have wiſhed or hoped for. We only prayed, only hoped, that God would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>you</hi> honeſt, and <hi>me</hi> virtuous: And ſee, O ſee, my excellent Parents! how we are crown'd with Bleſſings upon Bleſſings, till we are the Talk of all that know us: — You for your Honeſty! I for my Humility and Virtue! — that Virtue which God's Grace inſpired, and your Examples and Leſſons, with thoſe of my dear good Lady, cultivated; and which now have left me nothing to do but to reap all the Rewards which this Life can afford; and if I walk humbly, and improve my bleſſed Opportunities, will heighten and perfect all in a ſtill more joyful Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity!—</p>
               <p>Hence, my dear Parents, (I mean, from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light I have in writing to you, a Delight which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports me ſo much above my own Sphere) you'll ſee that I <hi>muſt</hi> write to you, and cannot help it, if I would. And <hi>will</hi> it be a great Joy to you!—And is there any thing that can add to your Joy, think you, that is in the Power of your <hi>Pamela,</hi> that ſhe would
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0272600703:22"/>
not <hi>do</hi>! — O that the Lives and Healths of my deareſt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and my deareſt Parents, may be continued to me! And who then can be ſo bleſt as your <hi>Pamela?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>will</hi> write; <hi>depend</hi> upon it, I will — on every Occaſion: —And you augment my Joys, to think it is in my Power to add to your Comforts. Nor can you conceive the Pleaſure I have in hoping, that this your new happy Lot, may, by relieving you from corroding Care, and the too wearing Effects of hard Labour, add, in theſe your advanced Years, to both your Days! — For ſo happy am I, I can have no Grief, no Pain, in looking forward, but from ſuch Thoughts as remind me, that one Day, either you from me, or I from you, muſt be ſeparated.</p>
               <p>But 'tis fit that we ſo comport ourſelves, as that we ſhould not imbitter our preſent Happineſs with Proſpects too gloomy — but bring our Minds to be chearfully thankful for the preſent, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enjoy that <hi>preſent</hi> as we go along, — and at laſt, when all is to be wound up, lie down, and ſay, <hi>Not mine,</hi> but <hi>thy Will be done!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I have written a great deal; yet have much ſtill to ſay, relating to other Parts of your kind, your acceptable Letter; and ſo will ſoon write again: For I muſt think every Opportunity happy, whereby I can aſſure you, how much I am, and will ever be, without any Addition to my Name, if that will make you eaſier,</p>

Letter, and my beſt Beloved's kind Deportment upon ſhewing it to him, raiſed me into a Frame of Mind, that was bordering on Ecſtaſy: Yet am I ſure, I wrote my Heart. But you muſt not, my dear Father, write to your poor <hi>Pamela</hi> ſo affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. Your <hi>ſteadier</hi> Mind could hardly bear your own moving Strain, and you was forced to lay down your Pen, and retire: How then could I, who love you ſo dearly, if you had not, if I may ſo ſay, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed</hi> that Love by freſh and ſtronger Inſtances of your Worthineſs, forbear being affected, and raiſed above myſelf?—But I will not again touch upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>You muſt know then, that my deareſt Spouſe commands me, with his kind Reſpects, to tell you, that he has thought of a Method to make your <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Hearts</hi> eaſy; thoſe were his Words—And this is, ſaid he, by putting that whoſe Eſtate, with the new Purchaſe, under your Father's Care, as I at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol. II. <hi>p.</hi> 341.</note>; and he ſhall receive and pay, and order every thing as he pleaſes, and <hi>Longman,</hi> who grows in Years, ſhall be eaſed of that Burden. Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writes, ſaid he, a very legible Hand, and he ſhall take what Aſſiſtants he pleaſes: And do you, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſee to that, that this new Task may be made as eaſy and pleaſant to him as poſſible. He ſhall make up his Accounts only to you, my Dear. And there will be ſeveral Pleaſures ariſe to me upon it, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he: Firſt, That it will be a Relief to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Longman,</hi> who has Buſineſs enough on his Hands beſides. Next, It will make the good Couple eaſy, that they have an Opportunity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying that as their Due, which now their too grateful Hearts give them ſo many cauſeleſs Scruples about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0272600703:24"/>
Thirdly, it will employ your Father's Time, more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to <hi>your</hi> Liking, and <hi>mine,</hi> becauſe with more Eaſe to himſelf; for you ſee his induſtrious Will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſatisfied without doing ſomething. In the fourth Place, the Management of this Eſtate will gain him more Reſpect and Reverence among the Tenants and his Neighbours; and yet be all in his own way. —For, my Dear, added he, you'll ſee, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways one Point in View with me, to endeavour to convince every one, that I eſteem and value them for their own intrinſick Merit, and want not any body to diſtinguiſh them in any other Light than that in which they have been accuſtomed to appear.</p>
               <p>So, my dear Father, the Inſtrument will be drawn, and brought you by honeſt Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> who will be with you in a few Days, to put the laſt Hand to the new Purchaſe, and to give you Poſſeſſion of your new Commiſſion, if you pleaſe to accept it; as I hope you will; and the rather, for my dear Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s third Reaſon; and becauſe I know, that this Truſt will be diſcharged as worthily and as ſufficiently, after you are uſed to it, as if Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> himſelf was in it — And better it cannot be Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> is very fond of this Relief, and longs to be down to ſettle every thing with you, as to the proper Powers, the Method, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —and he ſays, in his uſual way of Phraſing, that he'll make it as eaſy to you as a Glove.</p>
               <p>If you do accept it, my beſt Beloved will leave every thing to you, as to Rent, where not already fixed, and likewiſe as to Acts of Kindneſs and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be done where you think proper; and he is pleaſed to ſay, That, with all his bad Qualities, he was ever deemed a kind Landlord; and this I can confirm in fifty Inſtances to his Honour: So that the old Gentleman, ſaid he, need not be afraid of being put upon ſevere or harſh Methods of Proceeding, where Things will do without; and he'll always have it in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0272600703:25"/>
his Power to befriend an honeſt Man: So that the Province will be intirely ſuch a one as ſuits with his Inclination. If any thing difficult or perplexing ariſes, continued he, or where a little Knowledge in Law-matters is neceſſary, <hi>Longman</hi> ſhall do all that: And your Father will ſee, that he will not have in thoſe Points a Coadjutor that will be too hard-hearted for his Wiſh: For it was a Rule my Father ſet me, and I have ſtrictly followed, that tho' I have a Lawyer for my Steward, it was rather to know how to do <hi>right</hi> Things, than <hi>oppreſſive</hi> ones; and <hi>Longman</hi> has ſo well anſwered this Intention, that he was always more noted for compoſing Differences, than promoting Law-ſuits.</p>
               <p>I dare ſay, my dear Father, this will be an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Employment to you, on the ſeveral Accounts my deareſt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was pleaſed to mention: And what a charming Contrivance is here!—God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever bleſs his conſiderate Heart for it!—To make you uſeful to him, and eaſy to yourſelf; as well as reſpected by, and even a Benefactor to all around you! What can one ſay to all theſe Things?—But what ſignifies exulting in one's Gratitude for <hi>one</hi> Benefit!— Every Hour the dear Gentleman heaps new ones upon us, and we have hardly Time to thank him for one, but a ſecond, and a third, and ſo on to countleſs Degrees, confound one, and throw back one's Words upon one's Heart before they are well formed, and oblige one to ſit down under all with profound Silence and Admiration.</p>
               <p>As to what you mention of the Deſire of Couſin <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Roger,</hi> to come to live with you, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſound what our dear Benefactor's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was. He was pleaſed to ſay, I have nothing to chuſe in this Caſe, my Dear. Your Father is his own Maſter: He may employ whom he pleaſes; and, if they are not wanting in Reſpect to him and your
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0272600703:26"/>
Mother, I think, as he rightly obſerves, Relation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould rather have the Preference; and as he can remedy Inconveniences, if he finds any, by all means let every Branch of your Family have Reaſon to rejoice with him.</p>
               <p>But I have thought of this Matter a good deal, ſince I had the Favour of your Letter; and I hope, ſince you condeſcend to ask my Advice, you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, if I give it freely; yet intirely ſubmitting all to your own Liking.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place, then, I think it would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have <hi>any body</hi> than Relations; and that for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p>One is apt to expect more Regard from Relations, and they more Indulgence, than Strangers can have Reaſon for.</p>
               <p>That where there is ſuch a Difference in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of both, it is hardly poſſible but Uneaſineſs muſt ariſe.</p>
               <p>That this will ſubject you to bear it, or to reſent it, and to part with them. If you bear it, you will know no End of Impoſitions: If you diſmiſs them, it will cccaſion Ill-will. They will call you unkind; and you them ungrateful; and as, it may be, your proſperous Lot will raiſe you Enviers, ſuch will be apt to believe <hi>them,</hi> rather than <hi>you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the World will be inclined to think, that we are crouding upon a generous Gentleman, a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Family of indigent People; and tho' they may be ever ſo deſerving, yet it will be ſaid, The Girl is filling every Place with her Relations, and <hi>beleaguer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as you ſignificantly expreſs it, a worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And this will be ſaid, perhaps, ſhould one's Kindred behave ever ſo worthily; And ſo,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0272600703:27"/>In the next Place, one would not, for <hi>their</hi> Sakes, that this ſhould be done; who may live with <hi>leſs</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and <hi>equal</hi> Benefit, any-where elſe: For I would not wiſh any one of them to be lifted out of his Station, and made independent, at Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Expence, if their Induſtry will not do it; altho' I would never ſcruple to do any thing reaſonable to promote or aſſiſt that Induſtry, in the way of their Callings.</p>
               <p>Then it will poſſibly put others of our Relations upon the ſame Expectations, of living with you; and this may occaſion Ill-will among them, if ſome be preferred to others in your Favour.</p>
               <p>Then, my dear Father, I apprehend, that our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and honoured Benefactor would be under ſome Difficulty, from his natural Politeneſs, and Regard for you and me.—You ſee how kindly, on all Occaſions, he treats you both, not only as the Father and Mother of his <hi>Pamela,</hi> but as if you were his own Father and Mother: And if you had any body as your Servants there, who called you Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, or Grandfather, or Uncle, he would not care, when he came down, to treat them on the Foot of common Servants, tho' <hi>they</hi> might nevertheleſs think themſelves honoured (as they would be, and as I am ſure I ſhall always think <hi>myſelf</hi>) with his Commands. And would it not, if they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and worthy, be as great a Difficulty upon <hi>them,</hi> to be thus diſtinguiſhed, as it would be to <hi>him,</hi> and to <hi>me,</hi> for <hi>his</hi> ſake? For otherwiſe, (believe me, I hope you will, my dear Father and Mother) I could ſit down and rejoice with the meaneſt and remoteſt Relation I have. But in the World's Eye, to every body but my beſt of Parents, I muſt, if I have ever ſo much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance to it, appear in a Light that may not give Diſcredit to his Choice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0272600703:28"/>Then again, as I hinted, you will have it in your Power, without the leaſt Injury to our common Benefactor, to do kinder Things by any of our Relations, when <hi>not</hi> with you, than you can do, if they <hi>live</hi> with you.</p>
               <p>You may lend them a little Money, to put them in a way, if any thing offers that you think will be to their Advantage. You can fit out my She-Couſins to good reputable Places.—The younger you can put to School, or, when fit, to Trades, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Talents, and ſo they will be of courſe in a way to get an honeſt and creditable Livelihood.</p>
               <p>But, above all things, one would as much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as one could, ſuch a proud and ambitious Spirit in any of them, as ſhould want to raſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by Favour inſtead of Merit; and this the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that, undoubtedly, there are many more happy Perſons in low than in high Life, take Number for Number, all the World over.</p>
               <p>I am ſure, altho' four or five Years of different Life had paſſed with me, I had ſo much Pride and Pleaſure in the Thought of working for my Living with you, my dear Parents, if I could but get honeſt to you, that it made my Confinement the more grievous to me, and even, if poſſible, aggravated the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions attending it.</p>
               <p>But I muſt beg of you, not to harbour a Thought, that theſe my Reaſons proceed from the bad Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of a Heart tainted with Pride on its high Condition. Indeed there can be no Reaſon for it, to one who thinks after this manner:—The greateſt Families on Earth have ſome among them who are unhappy, and low in Life; and ſhall ſuch an one reproach me with having twenty low Relations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have, peradventure, not above Five? or with Ten, becauſe they have but one, or two, or
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0272600703:29"/>
three?—Or ſhould I, on the other hand, be aſham'd of Relations who had done nothing blame-worthy, and whoſe Poverty (a very neceſſary State in the Scale of Beings) was all their Crime; when there is hardly any great Family but has produced Inſtances of Perſons guilty of bad Actions, <hi>really</hi> bad, which have reduced them to a Diſtreſs we never knew? Let the Perſon who would reproach me with <hi>low Birth,</hi> which is <hi>no</hi> Diſgrace, and what I <hi>cannot help,</hi> give me no Cauſe to retort upon him <hi>low Actions,</hi> which <hi>are</hi> a Diſgrace to any Station, the more ſo, the higher it is, and which he <hi>can help</hi>; or elſe I ſhall ſmile with Contempt at his empty Reproach: And could I be half ſo proud <hi>with</hi> Cauſe, as he is <hi>without,</hi> glory in my Advantage over him.</p>
               <p>Let us then, my dear Father and Mother, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to judge of one another, as God, at the laſt Day, will judge of us all: And then the honeſt Peaſant will ſtand fairer in our Eſteem, than the guilty Peer.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, this ſhall be my own Rule — Every one who acts juſtly and honeſtly, I will look upon as my Relation, whether he be ſo or not, and the more he want my Aſſiſtance, the more intitled to it he ſhall be, as well as to my Eſteem: While thoſe who deſerve it not, muſt expect nothing but Compaſſion from me, and my Prayers, were they my Brothers or Siſters. 'Tis true, had I not been poor and lowly, I might not have thought thus: But if it be a right way of Thinking, it is a Bleſſing that I was ſo; and that ſhall never be matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to me, which one Day will be matter of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Upon the Whole then, I ſhould think it adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, my dear Father and Mother, to make ſuch kind Excuſes to the offered Services of my Couſins, as your better Reaſon ſhall ſuggeſt to you; and to do
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0272600703:30"/>
any thing elſe for them of <hi>more</hi> Value, as their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may require, or Occaſions offer to ſerve them.</p>
               <p>But if the employing them, and having them about you, will add any one Comfort to your Lives, I give up intirely my own Opinion, and doubt not every thing will be thought well of, that you ſhall think fit to do.</p>
               <p>And ſo I conclude with aſſuring you, that I am, my ever-dear Parents,</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>My deareſt Daughter,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>HOW ſhall I do to anſwer, as they deſerve, your two laſt Letters? Surely no happy Couple ever had ſuch a Child as we have! But it is in vain to aim at Words like your Words; and equally in vain for us to offer to ſet forth the Thankfulneſs of our Hearts, on the kind Office your honoured Husband has given us; for no Reaſon but to favour us ſtill more, and to quiet our Minds in the Notion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſeful to him. God grant I may be able to be ſo!—Happy ſhall I be if I can! But I ſee the generous Drift of his Propoſal; it is only to make me more eaſy from the Nature of my Employment, and in my Mind too, overloaden, as I may ſay, with Benefits; and at the ſame time to make me more reſpected in my new Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0272600703:31"/>I can only ſay, I moſt gratefully accept of the kind Offer; and ſince it will eaſe the worthy Mr. <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> ſhall with ſtill greater Pleaſure do all I can in it. But I doubt I ſhall be wanting in Ability; I doubt I ſhall: But I will be juſt and honeſt, however. That, by God's Grace, will be within my own Capacity; and that, I hope, I may anſwer for.</p>
               <p>It is kind, indeed, to put it in my Power to do good to thoſe who ſhall deſerve it: And I will take <hi>double</hi> Pains to find out the true Merit of ſuch as I ſhall recommend to Favour, and that their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances be really ſuch as I ſhall repreſent them.</p>
               <p>But one thing, my dear Daughter, let me deſire, that I may make up my Accounts to Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> or to his Honour himſelf, when he ſhall make us ſo happy as to be here with us. I don't know how—but it will make me uneaſy, if I am to make up my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to you: For ſo well known is your Love to us, that tho' you would no more do an unjuſt thing, than, by God's Grace, we ſhould deſire you; yet this ſame ill-willing World might think it was like making up Accounts to one's ſelf.</p>
               <p>Do, my deareſt Child, get me off of this Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and I <hi>can</hi> have no other; for already I am in Hopes I have hit upon a Contrivance to improve the Eſtate, and to better the Condition of the Tenants at the ſame time, at leaſt, not to worſt them, and which, I hope, will pleaſe every body: But I will acquaint Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> with this, and take his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for I will not be too troubleſome either to you, my dear Child, or to your Spouſe.— If I could act ſo for his Intereſt, as not to be a Burden, what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Creatures ſhould we both be in our own Minds! We find ourſelves more and more reſpected by every one; and, ſo far as ſhall be conſiſtent with our new Truſt, we will endeavour to deſerve it, that we may
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0272600703:32"/>
intereſt as many as know us in our own good Wiſhes and Prayers for both your Happineſs.</p>
               <p>But let me ſay, how much convinced I am by the Reaſons you give for not taking to us any of our Relations. Every one of thoſe Reaſons has its Force with us. How happy are we to have ſo prudent a Daughter to adviſe with! And I think myſelf obliged to promiſe this, that whatever I do for any of them above the Amount of forty Shillings at one Time, I will take your Direction in it, that your wiſe Hints of making every one continue their Induſtry, and not to rely upon Favour inſtead of Merit, may be followed. I am ſure this is the way to make them <hi>happier,</hi> as well as <hi>better</hi> Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for, as I have often thought, if one were to have a hundred Pounds a Year in good Comings-in, it would not do without Induſtry; and with it, one may do with a Quarter of it, and leſs.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, my dear Child, your Reaſons are ſo good, that I wonder they came not into my Head before, and then I needed not to have troubled you about the Matter: But yet it ran in my own Thought, that I could not like to be an Incroacher:— For I hate a dirty thing; and in the midſt of my Diſtreſſes, never could be guilty of one. Thank God for it.</p>
               <p>You rejoice our Hearts beyond Expreſſion at the Hope you give us of receiving Letters from you now-and-then: To be ſure it will be the chief Comfort of our Lives, next to ſeeing you, as we are put in hope we ſometimes ſhall. But yet, my dear Child, don't let us put you to Inconvenience neither. Pray don't! You'll have enough upon your Hands without — To be ſure you will.</p>
               <p>The Workmen have made a good Progreſs, and wiſh for Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> to come down; as we alſo do.</p>
               <p>You need not be afraid we ſhould think you proud, or lifted up with your Condition. You have wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0272600703:33"/>
the firſt Dangers, and but for your fine Cloaths and Jewels, we ſhould not ſee any Difference, indeed we ſhould not, between our dear <hi>Pamela,</hi> and the much-reſpected Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>— But God has given you too much Senſe to be proud or lifted up. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in your former Writings, a Saying of the Squire's, ſpeaking of you, my dear Child, That it was for Perſons who were not uſed to Praiſe, and did not deſerve it, to be proud of it <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol. II. <hi>p.</hi> 139.</note> In like ſort one may ſay, it is for Perſons of little Senſe to be proud; but you, my dear Child, every one ſees, are <hi>above</hi> it: And that methinks is a proud Word; is it not? If one was not—I don't know how — half-ſtupid, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve — one would be raiſed by your high Style of Writing. But I ſhould be more than half-ſtupid, I'm ſure, to aim at it.</p>
               <p>Every Day brings us Inſtances of the good Name his Honour and you, my dear Child, have left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind you in this Country. Here comes one, and here comes another, and a third and a fourth; and, Goodman <hi>Andrew,</hi> cries one, and, Goody <hi>Andrews,</hi> cries another — (and ſome call us Mr. and Mrs. but we like the other full as well) When heard you from his Honour? How does his Lady do? — What a charming Couple are they! &amp; How lovingly they live! — What an Example do they give to all about them! — Then one cries, God bleſs 'em both; and another cries, <hi>Amen</hi>; and ſo ſays a third and a fourth; and all ſay, But when do you expect them down again? &amp; Such-a-one longs to ſee 'em; &amp; and ſuch-a-one will ride a Day's Journey, to have but a Sight of 'em at Church. &amp; And then they ſay, how this Gentleman praiſes them, and that Lady admires them. &amp; O my dear Child! what a Happineſs is this! How do your poor Mother and I ſtand fixed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0272600703:34"/>
to the Earth to hear both your Praiſes, our Tears trickling down our Cheeks, and our Hearts heaving as if they would burſt with Joy, till we are forced to take Leave in half Words, and hand-in-hand go in, together, to bleſs God, and bleſs you both.—O my Daughter! what a happy Couple have God and you made us!</p>
               <p>Your poor Mother is very anxious about her dear Child. I will not touch upon a Matter ſo very irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to you to hear of. But, tho' the Time may be ſome Months off, ſhe every Hour prays for your Safety and Happineſs, and for all the Increaſe of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity that his Honour's generous Heart can wiſh for. This is all we will ſay at preſent: Only, that we are, with continued Prayers and Bleſſings, my deareſt Child,</p>

You cannot, my dear Child, imagine how I was aſhamed to have my poor Letter ſhewn to him. I hardly remember what I wrote; but it was from my Heart, I'm ſure; ſo I needed not to keep a Copy; for an honeſt Mind muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be the ſame, in Caſes that cannot admit of Change, ſuch as thoſe of my Thankfulneſs to God and to him. But don't ſhew him all I write; for I ſhall be afraid of what I ſay, if I think any body but our Daughter ſees it, who knows how to allow for her poor Parents Defects.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I HAD intended to have been with you before this; but my Lord has been a little indiſpoſed with the Gout, and <hi>Jackey</hi> too has had an Intermittent Fever; but they are pretty well recovered, and it ſhall not be long before I ſee you, now I underſtand you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from your <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Expedition.</p>
               <p>We have been exceedingly diverted with your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. You have given us, by their Means, many a delightful Hour, that otherwiſe would have hung heavy upon us; and we are all charm'd with you. Lady <hi>Betty,</hi> as well as her noble Mamma, has always been of our Party, whenever we have read your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. She is a dear generous Lady, and has ſhed many a Tear over them, as indeed we all have; and my Lord has not been unmov'd, nor <hi>Jackey</hi> neither, at ſome of your Diſtreſſes and Reflections. Indeed, <hi>Pamela,</hi> you are a charming Creature, and an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our Sex. We wanted to have had you among us an hundred times, as we read, that we might have lov'd, and kiſs'd, and thank'd you.</p>
               <p>But after all, my Brother, generous and noble as he was, when your Trials were over, was a ſtrange wicked young Fellow; and happy it was for you both, that he was ſo cleverly caught in the Trap he had laid for your Virtue.</p>
               <p>I can aſſure you, my Lord longs to ſee you, and will accompany me; for, he ſays, he has but a faint Idea of your Perſon. I tell him, and tell them all, that you are the fineſt Girl, and the moſt improv'd in Perſon and Mind, I ever beheld; and I am nor afraid, altho' they ſhould imagine all they can in your Favour,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0272600703:36"/>
from my Account of you, that they will be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed when they ſee you, and converſe with you.

                  <salute>My dear good Lady,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU have done me great Honour in the Letter your Ladyſhip has been pleaſed to ſend me; and it is a high Pleaſure to me, now all is ſo happily over, that my poor Papers were in the leaſt diverting to you and to ſuch honourable and worthy Perſons as your Ladyſhip is pleaſed to mention. I could wiſh, my dear Lady, I might be favour'd with ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on my Conduct, (ſo nakedly ſet forth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Imagination that they would ever appear in ſuch an Aſſembly) as may be of Uſe to me in my future Life, and make me, by that means, more worthy than it is otherwiſe poſſible I can be, of the Honour to which I am raiſed. Do, deareſt Lady, favour me ſo far: I am prepared to receive Blame, and to benefit by it, and cannot expect Praiſe ſo much from my <hi>Actions</hi> as from my <hi>Intentions</hi>; for, indeed, <hi>theſe</hi> were always juſt and honourable: But why even for theſe do I talk of Praiſe, ſince, being prompted by Impulſes I could not reſiſt, it can be no Merit in me to have been govern'd by them?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0272600703:38"/>As to the Papers following thoſe in your Ladyſhip's Hands, when I ſay, that they muſt needs appear im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to ſuch Judges, after what you know, I dare ſay your Ladyſhip will not inſiſt upon them; yet I will not ſcruple briefly to mention what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>All my Dangers and Trials were happily at an End; So that they only contain
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"the Converſations that paſſed between your Ladyſhip's generous Brother and me; his kind Aſſurances of honourable Love to me; my Acknowledgments of Unworthineſs to him; Mrs. <hi>Jewkes</hi>'s reſpectful Change of Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards me; Mr.<hi>B.</hi>'s Reconciliation to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>; his introducing me to the good Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the Neighbourhood, and avowing before them his honourable Intentions. A Viſit from my honeſt Father, who (not knowing what to conclude from the Letter I wrote to him before I returned to your honoured Brother, deſiring my Papers from him) came in great Anxiety of Heart to know the worſt, doubting I had at laſt been caught by a Stratagem that had ended in my Ruin. His joyful Surprize to find how happy I was likely to be. All the Hopes given me, anſwer'd, by the private Celebration of our Nuptials — An Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſo much above all that my utmoſt Ambition could make me aſpire to, and which I never can deſerve! Your Ladyſhip's Arrival, and Anger, not knowing I was actually marry'd, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing me a vile wicked Creature; in which Caſe I ſhould have deſerved the worſt of Uſage. Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s angry Leſſons to me, for daring to interfere, tho' I thought in the tendereſt and moſt dutiful Manner, between your Ladyſhip and himſelf. The moſt acceptable Goodneſs and Favour of your Ladyſhip afterwards to me, of which, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes me, I ſhall ever retain the moſt grateful
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0272600703:39"/>
Senſe. My Return to this ſweet Manſion in a manner ſo different from my quitting it, where I had been ſo happy for four Years, in paying my Duty to the beſt of Miſtreſſes, your Ladyſhip's excellent Mother, to whoſe Goodneſs in taking me from my poor honeſt Parents, and giving me what Education I have, I owe, under God, my Happineſs. The Joy of good Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> and all the Servants, on this Occaſion. Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s acquainting me with Miſs <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and preſenting to me the pretty Miſs <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> at the Dairy-houſe. Our Appearance at Church; the Favour of the Gentry in the <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,</hi> who, knowing your Ladyſhip had not diſdain'd to look upon me, and to be favourable to me, came the more readily into a neighbourly Intimacy with me, and ſtill ſo much the more readily, as the continued Kindneſs of my dear Benefactor, and his condeſending Deportment to me before them, (as if I had been worthy of the Honour done me) did Credit to his own ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Act."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe, my Lady, down to my good Parents ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out to this Place, in order to be ſettled, by my honoured Benefector's Bounty, in the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Farm, are the moſt material Contents of my remaining Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: And tho' they might be the moſt agreeable to thoſe for whom only they were written, yet, <hi>as</hi> they were principally Matters of courſe, after what your Ladyſhip has with you; <hi>as</hi> the Joy of my fond Heart can be better judg'd of by your Ladyſhip, than deſcribed by me; and <hi>as</hi> your Ladyſhip is acquainted with all the Particulars the can be worthy of any other Perſon's Notice but my dear Parents; I am ſure your Ladyſhip will diſpenſe with your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: and I make it my humble Requeſt, that you will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0272600703:40"/>For, Madam, you muſt needs think, that when my Doubts were diſpell'd; when I was confident all my Trials were over; when I had a Proſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me of being ſo abundantly rewarded for what I had ſuffer'd; when every Hour roſe upon me with new Delight, and fraught with freſh Inſtances of generous Kindneſs from ſuch a dear Gentleman, my Maſter, my Benefactor, the Son of my honoured Lady; your Ladyſhip muſt needs think, I ſay, that I muſt be <hi>too</hi> much affected, my Heart muſt be <hi>too</hi> much open'd; and eſpecially as it then (reliev'd from its paſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xieties and Fears, which had kept down and damp'd the latent Flame) firſt diſcover'd to me Impreſſions of which before I hardly thought it ſuſceptible. — So that it is ſcarce poſſible, that my <hi>Joy</hi> and my <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> if I were to be try'd by ſuch Judges of Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and Decorum, as Lord and Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> the honoured Counteſs, and Lady <hi>Betty,</hi> could be ſo <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately,</hi> ſo <hi>laudably</hi> coupled, as were to be wiſh'd: Altho' indeed the continued Senſe of my Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Diſgrace the dear Gentleman would bring upon himſelf by his generous Goodneſs to me, always went hand-in-hand with that my <hi>Joy</hi> and my <hi>Prudence</hi>; and what theſe Conſiderations took from the <hi>former,</hi> being added to the <hi>latter,</hi> kept me ſteadier and more equal to myſelf than otherwiſe it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſuch a young Creature as I could have been.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, my dear good Lady, I hope I ſtand excus'd, and ſhall not bring upon myſelf. the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of being diſobedient to your Commands.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Madam, as you inform me, that my good Lord <hi>Davers</hi> will attend your Ladyſhip hither, I ſhould never dare to look his Lordſhip in the Face, if all the Emotions of my Heart on ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Occaſions, ſtood confeſs'd to his Lordſhip; and, indeed, if I am aſhamed they ſhould to your
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0272600703:41"/>
Ladyſhip, and to the Counteſs, and Lady <hi>Betty,</hi> whoſe Goodneſs might induce you all three to think favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, in ſuch Circumſtances, of one who is of your own Sex, how would it concern me, that the ſame ſhould appear before ſuch Gentlemen as my Lord and his Nephew?—Indeed I could not look up to either of them, in the Senſe of this.—And give me Leave to hope, that ſome of the Scenes, in the Letters your Ladyſhip had, were not read to Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: Your Ladyſhip muſt needs know which I mean, and will think of my two grand Trials of all.—For tho' I was the innocent Subject of wicked Attempts, and ſo cannot, I hope, ſuffer in any one's Opinion, for what I could not help; yet, for your dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſake, as well as for the Decency of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, one would not, when one ſhall have the Honour to appear before my Lord and his Nephew, be looked upon, methinks, with that Levity of Eye and Thought, which perhaps hard-hearted Gentlemen may paſs upon one, by reaſon of thoſe very Scenes, which would move Pity and Concern, in a good Lady's Breaſt, for a poor Creature ſo attempted.</p>
               <p>So, my dear Lady, be pleaſed to let me know, if the Gentlemen <hi>have</hi> heard all.—I hope they have not.—And be pleaſed alſo to point out to me ſuch Parts of my Conduct as deſerve Blame: Indeed, I will try to make a good Uſe of your Cenſure, and am ſure I ſhall be thankful for it;—for it will make me hope to be more and more worthy of the Honour I have, of being exalted into ſuch a diſtinguiſhed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and the Right the beſt of Gentlemen has given me to ſtyle myſelf</p>

                  <salute>
                     <hi>My dear</hi> Pamela,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU have given us all a great Diſappointment, in declining to oblige me with the Sequel of your Papers. I was a little out of Humour with you at firſt;—I muſt own I was:—For I cannot bear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, when my Heart is ſet upon any thing. But Lady <hi>Betty</hi> became your Advocate, and ſaid, She thought you very excuſable; ſince, no doubt, there might be many tender Things, circumſtanced as you was, which might be well enough for your Parents to ſee, but for nobody elſe; and Relations of our Side leaſt of all, whoſe future Intimacy and frequent Viſits, might give Occaſions for Raillery and Remarks, that might not be always agreeable. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded her Apology for you the more, becauſe I knew it was a great Balk to her, that you did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with my Requeſt. But now, Child, when you know me more, you'll find, that if I am oblig'd to give up one Point, I always inſiſt upon another, as near it as I can, in order to ſee if it be only <hi>one</hi> thing I am to be refuſed, or <hi>every</hi> thing; in which laſt Caſe I know how to take my Meaſures, and reſent.</p>
               <p>Now then, this is what I inſiſt on; That you cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with me in the ſame manner you did with your Parents, and acquaint me with every Paſſage that is of Concern to you; beginning with your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts how you ſpent your Time, both of you, when you were in <hi>Kent</hi>; for, you muſt know, we are all taken with your Duty to your Parents, and the Diſcretion of the good Couple, and think you have given a very edifying Example of filial Piety to all who ſhall hear your Story; for if ſo much Duty is owing to Parents, where nothing can be done for one, how much more is it to be expected, where there
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0272600703:43"/>
is a Power to add to the natural Obligation, all the Comforts and Conveniences of Life? We People in upper Life, you muſt know, love to hear how Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and unexpected Benefits operate upon honeſt Minds, who have little more than plain artleſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for their Guide; and we flatter ourſelves with the Hopes of many a delightful Hour, by your Means, in this our ſolitary Situation, as it will be, if we are obliged to paſs the next Winter in it, as my Lord and the Earl threaten me, and the Counteſs, and Lady <hi>Betty,</hi> that we ſhall. Then let us hear of every thing that gives you Joy and Trouble: And if my Brother carries you to Town, for the Winter, while he attends Parliament, the Advices you will be able to give us of what paſſes in <hi>London,</hi> and of the public Entertainments and Diverſions he will take you to, as you will relate them from your own artleſs and natural Obſervations, will be as diverting to us, as if we were at them ourſelves. For a young Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of your good Underſtanding, to whom all theſe Things will be quite new, will give us, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, a better Taſte of them, their Beauties and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, than we might have before. For we People of Quality go to thoſe Places, dreſs'd out and adorn'd, in ſuch Manner, outvying one another, as if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ourſelves as ſo many Parts of the public En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, and are too much pleaſed with ourſelves to be able ſo to attend to what we ſee, as to form a right Judgment of it: And, indeed, we, ſome of us, behave with ſo much Indifference to the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if we thought ourſelves above being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by what we come to ſee, and as if our View was rather to trifle away our Time, than to improve ourſelves, by attending to the Story or the Action.</p>
               <p>See, <hi>Pamela,</hi> I ſhall not make an unworthy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent altogether; for I can get into thy grave Way, and moralize a little now-and-then: And if
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0272600703:44"/>
you'll promiſe to oblige me by your conſtant Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence in this way, and diveſt yourſelf of all Reſtraint, as if you was writing to your Parents, (and I can tell you, you'll write to one who will be as candid and as favourable to you as they can be) then I am ſure we ſhall have Truth and Nature from you; and theſe are Things which we are generally ſo much lifted above, by our Conditions, that we hardly know what they are.</p>
               <p>But I have written enough for one Letter: And yet, having more to ſay, I will, after this, ſend another, without waiting for your Anſwer, which you may give to both together; and am, mean time,</p>

                  <salute>
                     <hi>Dear</hi> Pamela,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I AM very glad thy honeſt Man has let thee into the Affair of <hi>Sally Godfrey.</hi> But pr'ythee, <hi>Pamela,</hi> give us an Account of the Manner in which he did it, and of thy Thoughts upon it; for that is a critical Caſe; and according as he has repreſented it, ſo ſhall I know what to ſay of it before you and him: For I would not make Miſchief between you for the World.</p>
               <p>This, let me tell you, will be a trying Part of your Conduct. For he loves the Child; and will judge of you by your Conduct towards it. He dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved her Mother; and, notwithstanding her Fault, ſhe well deſerv'd it: For ſhe was a ſenſible, ay, and a modeſt Lady, and of an ancient and genteel Family. But he was Heir to a noble Eſtate, was of a bold and enterpriſing Spirit, fond of Intrigue— Don't let this concern you.—You'll have the greater Happineſs and Merit too, if you can hold him—And
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0272600703:45"/>
'tis my Opinion, if any body can, you will.—Then he did not like the young Lady's Mother, who ſought artfully to intrap him. So that the poor Girl, divided between her Inclination for him, and her Duty to her deſigning Mother, gave into the Plot upon him; and he thought himſelf, vile Wretch as he was, for all that!—at Liberty to ſet up Plot againſt Plot, and the poor Lady's Honour was the Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>I hope you ſpoke well of her to him. I hope you received the Child kindly.—I hope you had Preſence of Mind to do this.—For it was a nice Part to act; and all his Obſervations were up, I dare ſay, on the Occaſion. — Do, let me hear how it was. There's my good <hi>Pamela,</hi> do. And write, I charge you, freely and without Reſtraint; for altho' I am not your Mother, yet am I <hi>his</hi> elder Siſter, you know— and, as ſuch—come, I will ſay ſo, in hopes you'll oblige me—<hi>your</hi> Siſter, and ſo intitled to expect a Compliance with my Requeſt: For is there not a Duty, in degree, to elder Siſters from younger?</p>
               <p>As to our Remarks upon your Behaviour, they have been very much to your Credit, I can tell you that: But, nevertheleſs, I will, to encourage you to enter into this requeſted Correſpondence with me, conſult Lady <hi>Betty,</hi> and will go over your Papers again, and try to find fault with your Conduct; and if we can ſee any thing cenſurable, will freely let you know our Minds.</p>
               <p>But, before-hand, I can tell you, we ſhall be agreed in one Opinion; and that is, that we know not who would have acted as you have done, upon the Whole.</p>
               <p>So, <hi>Pamela,</hi> you ſee I put myſelf upon the ſame Foot of Correſpondence with you.—Not that I will promiſe to anſwer every Letter: No, you muſt not expect that.—Your Part will be a kind of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative purpoſely deſigned to entertain us here; and I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0272600703:46"/>
hope to receive ſix, ſeven, eight or ten Letters, as it may happen, before I return one: But ſuch a Part I will bear in it, as ſhall let you know our Opinion of your Proceedings, and Relations of Things.— And as you wiſh to be found fault with, as you ſay, you ſhall freely have it, (tho' not in a ſplenetic or ill-natur'd way) as often as you give Occaſion. Now, you muſt know, <hi>Pamela,</hi> I have two Views in this: One is, to ſee how a Man of my Brother's Spirit, who has not deny'd himſelf any genteel Liberties, (for, it muſt be own'd, he never was a common Town Rake, and had always Dignity in his Roguery) will behave himſelf to you, and in Wedlock, which uſed to be very freely ſneered by him: The next, that I may love you more and more, which it will be enough to make me do, I dare ſay, as by your Letters I ſhall be more and more acquainted with you, as well as by Converſation; ſo that you can't be off, if you would.</p>
               <p>I know, however, you will have one Objection to this; and that is, that your Family Affairs will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire your Attention, and not give you the Time you uſed to have for this Employment. But conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Child, the Station you are raiſed to, does not require you to be quite a domeſtic Animal. You are lifted up to the Rank of a Lady, and you muſt act up to it, and not think of ſetting ſuch an Example, as will derive upon you the Ill-will and Cenſure of other Ladies.—For will any of our Sex viſit one who is continually employing herſelf in ſuch Works as either muſt be a Reproach to herſelf, or to them?—You'll have nothing to do but to give Orders. You will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider yourſelf as the Task-miſtreſs, and the common Herd of Female Servants as ſo many Negroes direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves by your Nod; or yourſelf as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-wheel, in ſome beautiful Piece of Mechaniſm, whoſe dignify'd grave Motion is to ſet a-going all the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0272600703:47"/>
Under-wheels, with a Velocity ſuitable to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Parts.—Let your Servants, under your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, do all that relates to Houſhold Oeconomy: They cannot write to entertain and inſtruct as you can. So what will you have to do?—I'll anſwer my own Queſtion: In the firſt Place, Endeavour to pleaſe your Sovereign Lord and Maſter; and, let me tell you, any other Woman in <hi>England,</hi> be her Quality ever ſo high, would have found enough to do to ſucceed in that. Secondly, To receive and pay Viſits, in order, for his Credit as well as your own, to make your faſhionable Neighbours fond of you. Then, thirdly, You will have Time upon your Hands (as your Monarch himſelf riſes early, and is tolerably regular for ſuch a Brazen-face as he has been) to write to me, in the manner I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and expect; and I ſee plainly, by your Style, that nothing can be eaſier for you, than to do this.</p>
               <p>And thus, and with Reading, may your Time be filled up with Reputation to yourſelf, and Delight to others, till a fourth Employment puts itſelf upon you; and that is, (ſhall I tell you in one Word, without mincing the Matter?) a Succeſſion of brave Boys, to perpetuate a Family that has for many hundred Years been eſteemed worthy and eminent, and which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now reduced, in the direct Line, to him and me, <hi>expects</hi> it from you; or elſe, let me tell you, (nor will I balk it) my Brother, by deſcending to the wholſome Cot — Excuſe me, <hi>Pamela,</hi>—will want one Apology for his Conduct, be as excellent as you may.</p>
               <p>I ſay this, Child, not to reflect upon you, ſince the thing is done; for I love you dearly, and will love you more and more—but to let you know what is expected from you, and to encourage you in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that is already opening to you both, and to me, who have the Welfare of the Family I ſprung from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0272600703:48"/>
ſo much at Heart, altho' I know this will be attended with ſome Anxieties to a Mind ſo thoughtful and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive as yours ſeems to be.</p>
               <p>O but this puts me in mind of your Solicitude for fear the Gentlemen ſhould have ſeen every thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in your Letters.—But this I will particularly ſpeak to in a third Letter, having fill'd my Paper on all Sides: And am</p>

               <head>LETTER X. From the ſame.</head>
               <p>AND ſo, <hi>Pamela,</hi> you are very ſolicitous to know if the Gentlemen have ſeen every Part of your Papers. I can't ſay but they have. Nor, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in regard to the Reputation of your ſaucy Man, do I ſee why the Parts you hint at, might not be read by thoſe to whom the reſt might be ſhewn.</p>
               <p>I can tell you, Lady <hi>Betty,</hi> who is a very nice and delicate Lady, had no Objections to any Part, tho' read before Men: Only now and then, crying out— O the vile Man!—See, Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> what Wretches you Men are!—And, commiſerating you, Ah! the poor <hi>Pamela!</hi> — And expreſſing her Impatience to hear on, how you eſcap'd at this time, and at that, and rejoicing in your Eſcape.—And now-and-then, O Lady <hi>Davers!</hi> what a vile Brother you have!— I hate him perfectly. — The poor Girl cannot be made Amends for all this, tho' he has marry'd her. Who, that knows theſe Things of him, would wiſh him to be hers, with all his Advantages of Perſon,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0272600703:49"/>
Mind and Fortune? — And ſuch-like Expreſſions in your Praiſe, and condemning him and his wicked Attempts.</p>
               <p>But I can tell you this, that except one had heard every Tittle of your Danger; how near you were to Ruin, and how little he ſtood upon taking any Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to effect his vile Purpoſes, even daring to attempt you in the Preſence of a <hi>good</hi> Woman, which was a Wickedneſs that every <hi>wicked</hi> Man could not be guilty of;—I ſay, except one had known theſe things, one ſhould not have been able to judge of the Merit of your Reſiſtance, and how ſhocking thoſe Attempts were to your Virtue, inſomuch that Life itſelf was indanger'd by them: Nor, let me tell you, could I in particular, have ſo well juſtify'd him for marrying you (I mean with reſpect to his own proud and haughty Temper of Mind) if there had been Room to think he could have had you upon eaſier Terms.</p>
               <p>It was neceſſary, Child, on twenty Accounts, that we, your and his Well-wiſhers and Relations, ſhould know that he had try'd every Stratagem, and made uſe of every Contrivance, to ſubdue you to his Purpoſe, before he marry'd you: And how would it have anſwer'd to his intrepid Character, and Pride of Heart, had we not been particularly let into the Nature of thoſe Attempts, which you ſo nobly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, as to convince us all, that you have deſerv'd the good Fortune you have met with, as well as all the kind and reſpectful Treatment he can poſſibly ſhew you?</p>
               <p>Nor ought you to be concern'd who ſees any the moſt tender Parts of your Story, except, as I ſaid, for <hi>his</hi> ſake; for it muſt be a very unvirtuous Mind, that can form any other Ideas from what you relate, than thoſe of Terror and Pity for you. Your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are too delicate to give the niceſt Ear Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, except at him.—You paint no Scenes but ſuch
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0272600703:50"/>
as make his Wickedneſs odious; and that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, much more Lady, muſt have a very corrupt Heart, who could, from ſuch Circumſtances of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, make any Reflections but what ſhould be to your Honour, and in Abhorrence of ſuch Actions. Indeed, Child, I am ſo convinced of this, that by this Rule I would judge of any Man's Heart in the World, better than by a thouſand Declarations and Proteſtations. I do aſſure you, rakiſh as <hi>Jackey</hi> is, and freely as I doubt not that Lord <hi>Davers</hi> has formerly lived, (for he has been a Man of Pleaſure) they gave me, by their Behaviour on theſe tenderer Occaſions, Reaſon to think they had more Virtue than not to be very apprehenſive for your Safety; and my Lord ſeveral times exclaim'd, that he could not have thought his Brother ſuch a Libertine neither.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Child, were not theſe things written in Confidence to your Mother? And bad as his Actions were to you, if you had not recited all you could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, would there not have been Room for any one who ſhould have ſeen what you writ, to imagine they had been ſtill worſe? — And how could the Terror be ſuppoſed to have had ſuch Effects upon you, as to indanger your Life, without imagining you had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the worſt that a vile Man <hi>could</hi> offer, unleſs you had told us, what that was which he <hi>did</hi> offer, and ſo put a Bound, as it were, to one's apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Imaginations of what you ſuffered, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt have been injurious to your Purity, tho' you could not help it?</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Pamela,</hi> it was but doing Juſtice to the Libertine himſelf, to tell your Mother the whole Truth, that ſhe might know he was not ſo very aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but that he could ſtop ſhort of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his wicked Purpoſes, which, he apprehended, if purſu'd, would deſtroy the Life, that, of all Lives, he would chuſe to preſerve; and you ow'd alſo thus
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0272600703:51"/>
much to your Parents Peace of Mind, that after all their diſtracting Fears for you, they might ſee they had Reaſon to rejoice in an uncontaminated Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And one cannot but reflect, now all is over, and he has made you his Wife, that it muſt be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the wicked Man, as well as to yourſelf, that he was not more guilty than he <hi>was,</hi> and that he took no more Liberties than he <hi>did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my own Part, I muſt ſay, that I could not have accounted for your Fits, by any Deſcription ſhort of thoſe you give; and had you been leſs parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in the Circumſtances, I ſhould have judg'd he had been ſtill <hi>worſe,</hi> and your Perſon, tho' not your Mind, leſs pure, than his Pride would expect from the Woman he ſhould marry: For this is the Caſe of all Rakes, that tho' they indulge in all manner of Libertiniſm themſelves, there is no Claſs of Men who exact greater Delicacy than they, from the Perſons they marry; tho' they care not how bad they make the Wives, the Siſters, and Daughters of others.</p>
               <p>I have run into Length again; ſo will only add, (and ſend all my three Letters together) that we all blame you in ſome degree for bearing the wicked <hi>Jewkes</hi> in your Sight, after the moſt impudent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance ſhe gave to his lewd Attempt; much leſs, we think, ought you to have left her in her Place, and rewarded her for her Vileneſs, which could hardly be equalled by the worſt Actions of the moſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Procureſs.</p>
               <p>I know the Difficulties you lay under, in his arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Will, and in his Interceſſion for her: But Lady <hi>Betty</hi> rightly obſerves, that he knew what a vile Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhe was, when he put you into her Power, and no doubt employ'd her, becauſe he was ſure ſhe would anſwer all his Purpoſes; and that therefore ſhe ſhould have had very little Opinion of the Sincerity of his Reformation, while he was ſo ſolicitous in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0272600703:52"/>
keeping her there, and in having her put on a foot, in the Preſent on your Nuptials, with honeſt <hi>Jervis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She would, ſhe ſays, had ſhe been in your Caſe, have had one Struggle for her Diſmiſſion, let it have been taken as it would; and he that was ſo well pleaſed with your Virtue, muſt have thought this a natural Conſequence of it, if he was in earneſt to reclaim.</p>
               <p>I know not whether you ſhew him all I write, or not: But I have written this laſt Part in the Cover, as well for want of Room, as that you may keep it from him, if you pleaſe. Tho', if you think it will ſerve any good End, I am not againſt ſhewing to him all I write. For I muſt ever ſpeak my Mind, tho' I were to ſmart for it; and that nobody can, or has the Heart to make me do, but my bold Brother. So, <hi>Pamela,</hi> for this time,</p>

                  <salute>My good Lady,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I AM honoured with your Ladyſhip's Three Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Contents of which are highly obliging to me: And I ſhould be inexcuſable, if I did not comply with your Injunctions, and be very proud and thankful for your Ladyſhip's Condeſcenſion in accepting of my poor Scribble, and promiſing me ſuch a rich and invaluable Return; of which you have given me already ſuch ample and ſuch delightful Inſtances. I will not plead my Defects, to excuſe my Obedience. I only fear, that the Awe which will be always upon me, when I write to your Ladyſhip, will lay me under ſo great a Reſtraint, that I ſhall fall ſhort even of the Merit my Papers have already made for me, thro' your kind Indulgence. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, ſheltering myſelf under your Goodneſs, I will chearfully comply with every thing your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip expects from me, that is in my Power to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0272600703:53"/>You will give me Leave, Madam, to put into ſome little Method, the Particulars of what you deſire of me; that I may ſpeak to them all: For ſince you are ſo good as to excuſe me from ſending the reſt of my Papers, (which indeed would not bear in many Places) I will omit nothing that ſhall tend to convince you of my Readineſs to obey you in every thing elſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then, your Ladyſhip would have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the happy Fortnight we paſſed in <hi>Kent,</hi> on one of the moſt agreeable Occaſions that could befal me.</p>
               <p>Secondly, An Account of the Manner in which your dear Brother acquainted me with the affecting Story of Miſs <hi>Godfrey,</hi> and my Behaviour upon it.</p>
               <p>And, thirdly, I preſume your Ladyſhip, and Lady <hi>Betty,</hi> expect that I ſhould ſay ſomething upon your welcome Remarks on my Conduct towards Mrs. <hi>Jewkes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Particulars contained in your Ladyſhip's kind Letters will naturally fall under one or other of theſe three Heads.— But expect not, my Lady, tho' I begin in Method thus, that I ſhall keep up to it; If your Ladyſhip will not allow for me, and keep in View the poor <hi>Pamela Andrews</hi> in all I write, but will have Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> in your Eye, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me? — But, indeed, I promiſe myſelf ſo much Improvement from this Correſpondence, that I enter upon it with a greater Delight than I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, notwithſtanding the mingled Awe and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that will accompany me, in every Part of the agreeable Task.</p>
               <p>To begin with the firſt Article;</p>
               <p>Your dear Brother, and my honeſt Parents — (I know your Ladyſhip will expect from me, that on
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0272600703:54"/>
all Occaſions I ſhould ſpeak of them with the Duty that becomes a good Child) — I ſay, then, your dear Brother, and they, and myſelf, ſet out on the <hi>Monday</hi> Morning for <hi>Kent,</hi> paſſing thro' <hi>St. Albans</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> at both which Places we ſtopp'd a Night; for our dear Benefactor would make us take eaſy Journeys; and on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Evening we arrived at the ſweet Place allotted for the good Couple. We were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only by <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> on Horſeback; for Mr. <hi>Colbrand,</hi> having ſprain'd his Foot, was in the Travelling-Coach with the Cook and Houſe-Maid, and <hi>Polly Barlow,</hi> a genteel new Servant, whom Mrs. <hi>Brooks</hi> recommended to wait on me.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> had been down there for a Fortnight, imploy'd in ſettling the Terms of an additional Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace to this pretty well-wooded and well-watered Eſtate; and the Account he gave of his Proceedings was very ſatisfactory to his honour'd Principal. He told us, he had much ado to diſſuade the Tenants from purſuing a form'd Reſolution of meeting their Landlord on Horſeback, at ſome Miles Diſtance; for he had inform'd them when he expected us: But knowing how deſirous Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was of being retired while he ſtaid here this time, he had ventured to aſſure them, that when every thing was ſettled, and the new Purchace actually enter'd upon, they would have his Preſence among them now-and-then; and that he would introduce them all at different times to their worthy Landlord, before we left the Country.</p>
               <p>The Houſe, my good Lady, is large and very commodious; and we found every thing about it, and in it, exceeding neat and convenient; which was owing to the worthy Mr. <hi>Longman</hi>'s Care and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The Ground is well-ſtock'd, the Barns and Out-houſes in excellent Repair, and my poor Father and Mother have only to wiſh, that they and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0272600703:55"/>
I may be deſerving of half the Goodneſs we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the bountiful Mind of your good Brother.</p>
               <p>But indeed, my Lady, I have the Pleaſure of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering every Day more and more, that there is not a better diſpos'd and more generous Gentleman in the World than himſelf, inſomuch that, I verily think, he has not been ſo careful to conceal his <hi>bad</hi> Actions as his <hi>good</hi> ones. His Heart is naturally bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, and his Beneficence is the Gift of God to him, as I have been ſo free as to tell him, to ſerve for excellent Purpoſes, even for a Foundation to the nobleſt Superſtructure, whenever the Rubbiſh of Senſe ſhall be clear'd from it, and the Divine Workmen be properly employ'd to build a Temple for the Deity to reſide in. — Pardon me, my dear Lady; I wiſh I may not be impertinently grave: But I find a great many Inſtances of his conſiderate Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which hardly any body knew of, and which, ſince I have been his Almoner, could not avoid coming to my Knowlege. — But this, poſſibly, is no News to your Ladyſhip. Every body knows the generous Goodneſs of your own Heart: Every one that wanted Relief taſted the Bounty of your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Mother, my late honour'd Lady: So that 'tis a <hi>Family Grace,</hi> and I have no need to ſpeak of it to you, Madam.</p>
               <p>This cannot, my dear Lady, I hope, be conſtrued as if I would hereby ſuppoſe ourſelves leſs oblig'd. Indeed I know nothing ſo God-like in Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as this Diſpoſition to do Good to our Fellow-Creatures; for is it not following immediately the Example of that gracious Providence which every Minute is conferring Bleſſings on us all, and by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power to the Rich, makes them but the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of its Benefits to thoſe that want them? But yet, as there are but too many Objects of Compaſſion, and as the moſt beneficent Mind in the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0272600703:56"/>
like Omnipotence, do Good to all, how much are they oblig'd who are diſtinguiſhed from others? And this, kept in Mind, will always contribute to make the Benefited receive as they ought the Favours of the Obliger.</p>
               <p>I know not if I write to be underſtood in all I mean; but my grateful Heart is ſo over-fill'd when it is imploy'd on this Subject, that methinks I want to ſay a great deal more, at the ſame time that I am apprehenſive I ſay too much. — Yet, perhaps, the Copies of the Letters I here incloſe to your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, (that mark'd [I.] written by me to my Father and Mother, on our Return hither from <hi>Kent</hi>; that mark'd [II.] from my dear Father in Anſwer to it, and that mark'd [III.] mine in Reply to his <note n="*" place="bottom">See Letters <hi>1, 2, 3,</hi> of this Volume.</note>) will, (at the ſame time that they may convince your Ladyſhip, that I will conceal nothing from you, in the Courſe of this Correſpondence, that may in the leaſt amuſe and divert you, or that may better explain our grateful Sentiments) in a great meaſure, anſwer what your Ladyſhip expects from me, as to the happy Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night we paſs'd in <hi>Kent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I will conclude this Letter, chuſing to ſuſpend the Correſpondence, till I know from your Ladyſhip, whether it will not be too low, too idle for your Attention; whether you will not diſpenſe with your own Commands for my writing to you, when you ſee it is ſo little likely to anſwer what you may poſſibly expect from me; or whether, if you inſiſt upon my ſcribbling, you would have me write in any other Way, be leſs tedious, leſs ſerious— in ſhort, leſs or more any thing. For all that is in my Power, your Ladyſhip may command from,</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOU very much oblige me by your chearful Compliance with my Requeſt. I leave it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to you to write in what Manner you pleaſe, and as you ſhall be in the Humour to write, when you take up your Pen; for then I ſhall have you write with leſs Reſtraint: For, you muſt know, that what we admire in you, are Truth and Nature, and not ſtudied or elaborate Sentiments. We can hear at Church, or we can read in our Cloſets, fifty good Things that we expect not from you; but we cannot receive from any body elſe the Pleaſure of Sentiments flowing with that artleſs Eaſe, which ſo much affects us when we read your Letters. Then, my ſweet Girl, your Gratitude, your Prudence, your Integrity of Heart, your Humility, ſhine ſo much in all your Letters and Sentiments, that no Wonder my Brother loves you as he does: But I ſhall make you proud, I doubt, and ſo by Praiſe ruin thoſe Graces which we admire, and, but for that, cannot praiſe too much. — In my Conſcience, if thou canſt hold as thou haſt begun, I believe thou wilt have him <hi>all to thyſelf,</hi> and that was once, more than I thought ever any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0272600703:58"/>
on this Side the Seventieth Year of his Age would ever be able to ſay. The Letters to and from your Parents we are charm'd with, and the communicating of them to me, I take to be as great an Inſtance of your Confidence in me, as it is of your Judgment and Prudence; for you cannot but think, that we his Relations are a little watchful over your Conduct, and have our Eyes upon you, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what Uſe you are likely to make of the Power you have over your Man, with reſpect to your own Relations.</p>
               <p>Hitherto all is unexampled Prudence, and you take the right Method to reconcile even the proudeſt of us to your Marriage, and make us not only love you, but reſpect your Parents, becauſe their Honeſty will, I perceive, be their diſtinguiſhing Character, and they will not forget themſelves, nor their former Condition.</p>
               <p>I can tell you, you are exactly right; for if you were to be an <hi>Incroacher,</hi> as the good old Man calls it, my Brother would be one of the firſt to ſee it, and he would gradually think leſs and leſs of you, till poſſibly he might come to deſpiſe you, and to repent of his Choice: For the leaſt Shadow of an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, or low Cunning, or mean Selfiſhneſs, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, you're a charming Girl; and Lady <hi>Betty</hi> ſays ſo too; and, moreover, adds, That if he makes you not the beſt and <hi>faithfulleſt</hi> of Husbands, he cannot deſerve you, for all his Fortune and Birth. — And, in my Heart, I begin to think ſo too.</p>
               <p>But won't you oblige me with the Sequel of your Letter to your Father? for you promiſe, my dear charming Scribbler, in that you ſent to me, to write again to his Letter; and I long to ſee how you anſwer the latter Part of it, about your Relations deſiring already to come and live with him. I know what I
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0272600703:59"/>
                  <hi>expect</hi> from you. But, let it be what it will, ſend it to me, exactly as you wrote it; and I ſhall ſee whether I have Reaſon to praiſe or to reprove you. For ſurely, <hi>Pamela,</hi> you muſt leave one Room to blame you for ſomething. Indeed I can hardly bear the Thought, that you ſhould ſo much excel as you do, and have more Prudence by Intuition, as it were, than the beſt of us have in a Series of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeleſt Education, and with fifty Advantages at leaſt in Converſation that <hi>you</hi> could not have, by reaſon of my Mother's retired Life, while you were with her, and your cloſe Attendance on her Perſon.</p>
               <p>But I'll tell you what has been a great Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you: It is your own Writings. This Itch of Scribbling has been a charming Help to you. For here, having a natural Fund of good Senſe, and a Prudence above your Years, you have, with the Obſervations thoſe Advantages have inabled you to make, been Flint and Steel too, as I may ſay, to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: So that you have ſtruck <hi>Fire</hi> when you pleas'd, wanting nothing but a few dry'd Leaves, like the firſt Pair in old <hi>Du Bartas,</hi> to ſerve as Tinder to catch your animating Sparks. So that reading con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and thus uſing yourſelf to write, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd you more than Reading could, and enjoying beſides the Benefit of a good Memory, every thing you heard or read became your own; and not only ſo, but improved by paſſing thro' more ſalubrious Ducts and Vehicles; like ſome fine Fruit grafted upon a common Free-ſtock, whoſe more exuberant Juices ſerve to bring to quicker and greater Perfection the downy Peach, or the ſmooth Nectarine with its crimſon Bluſh.</p>
               <p>Really, <hi>Pamela,</hi> I believe I, too, ſhall improve by writing to you. — Why, you dear Saucy-face, at this Rate, you'll make every one that converſes with you, better, and wiſer, and <hi>wittier</hi> too, as far as I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0272600703:60"/>
know, than they ever before thought there was <hi>Room</hi> for 'em to be.</p>
               <p>As to my own Part, I begin to like what I have written myſelf, I think; and your Correſpondence will poſſibly make me reſume the poetical Ideas that uſed to be ſtrong upon me, before I entered into the drowſy married Life; for my good Lord <hi>Davers</hi>'s Turn happens not to be to Books; and ſo, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, my Imagination was in a manner quench'd, and I, as a dutiful Wife ſhould, endeavour'd to form my Taſte by that of the Man I choſe.</p>
               <p>But after all, <hi>Pamela,</hi> you are not to be a little proud (I can tell you that) of my Correſpondence; and I could not have thought it e'er would have come to this: But you'll have the Penetration to obſerve, that I am the more free and unreſerved, to encourage <hi>you</hi> to write without Reſtraint: For already you have made us a Family of Writers and Readers; ſo that Lord <hi>Davers</hi> himſelf is become inamour'd of your Letters, and deſires of all things he may hear read every one that paſſes between us. Nay, <hi>Jackey,</hi> for that matter, who was the moſt thoughtleſs, whiſtling, ſauntering Fellow you ever knew, and whoſe Delight in a Book ran no higher than a Song or a Catch, now comes in with an inquiring Face, and vows he'll ſet Pen to Paper, and turn Letter-writer himſelf; and intends (if my Brother won't take it amiſs, he ſays) to begin to <hi>you,</hi> provided he could be ſure of an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>I have twenty Things ſtill to ſay; for you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked all our Boſoms: And yet I intended not to write above ten or a dozen Lines when I began; only to tell you, that I would have you take your own Way, in your Subjects, and in your Style. — And if you will but give me Hope, that you are in the Way I ſo much wiſh to have you in, I will then call myſelf

               <opener>
                  <salute>My dear good Lady,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WHAT kind, what generous things, are you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſay of your happy Correſpondent! And what Reaſon have I to value myſelf on ſuch an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as is now before me, if I am capable of improving it as I ought, from a Correſpondence with ſo noble and ſo admired a Lady! I wiſh I be not now proud indeed! — To be praiſed by ſuch a Genius, and by the noble Siſter of my honoured Benefactor, whoſe Favour, next to his own, it was always my chief Ambition to obtain, is what would be enough to fill with Vanity a ſteadier and a more equal Mind than mine.</p>
               <p>I have heard from my late honoured Lady, what a fine Pen her beloved Daughter was Miſtreſs of, when ſhe pleaſed to take it up: But I never could have had the Preſumption, but from your Ladyſhip's own Motion, to hope to be in any manner the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it, much leſs to be called your Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, I <hi>am</hi> proud, <hi>very</hi> proud of this Honour, and conſider it as ſuch a Heightening to my Pleaſures, as only <hi>that</hi> could give; and I will ſet about obeying your Ladyſhip without Reſerve.</p>
               <p>But permit me, in the firſt Place, to diſclaim any Merit, from my own poor Writings, to that Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0272600703:62"/>
which your Goodneſs imputes to me. What I have to boaſt of that Sort, is owing principally, if it deſerves Commendation, to my late excellent Lady. It is hardly to be imagined what Pains her Ladyſhip took with her poor Servant. Beſides make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me keep a Book of her Charities diſpenſed by my Hands, ſhe cauſed me always to ſet down, in my Way, the Caſes of the Diſtreſſed, their Griefs from their Misfortunes, and their Joys in her bountiful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and ſo I was enter'd early into the various Turns that affected worthy Hearts, and was taught the better to regulate my own, eſpecially by the Help of the fine Obſervations which my good Lady uſed to make to me, when I read to her what I wrote. For many a time has her worthy Heart run over with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at my Remarks, and with Praiſes; and I was her good Girl, her dear <hi>Pamela,</hi> her hopeful Maiden; and ſhe would ſometimes ſnatch my Hand with Tranſport, and draw me to her, and vouchſafe to kiſs me; and always was ſaying, what ſhe would do for me, if God ſpared her, and I continued to be deſerving.</p>
               <p>O my dear Lady! you cannot think what an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement this condeſcending Behaviour and Goodneſs was to me. Indeed, Madam, you <hi>cannot</hi> think it.</p>
               <p>I uſed to throw myſelf at her Feet, and embrace her Knees; and, my Eyes ſtreaming with Tears of Joy, would often cry, O continue to me, my deareſt Lady, the Bleſſing of your Favour and kind Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and it is all your happy, happy <hi>Pamela</hi> can wiſh for!</p>
               <p>But I will proceed to obey your Ladyſhip, and write with as much Freedom as I poſſibly <hi>can:</hi> For you muſt not expect, that I can be intirely diveſted of that Awe, which will lay me under more Reſtraint, than if I was writing to my Father and Mother,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0272600703:63"/>
whoſe Partiality for their Daughter made me in a manner ſecure of their good Opinions.</p>
               <p>And now, that I may ſhorten the Work before me, in the Account I am to give of the ſweet Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night that we paſſed in <hi>Kent,</hi> I incloſe not only the Copy of the Letter your Ladyſhip deſired me to ſend you, but my Father's Anſwer to it, which, with thoſe you have already, will ſet before your Ladyſhip all you want to ſee in relation to the Deſire ſome of my Kindred had to live with my Father, and my own Advice on the Occaſion. And I am humbly confident you will join in Sentiment with me: For Perſons are leſs doubtful of Approbation, when their Minds are incapable of dark Reſerves, or ſuch Views as they would be afraid ſhould be detected by the moſt watchful Obſerver of their Conduct: And your Ladyſhip gives me double Pleaſure, that you are pleaſed to have an Eye upon mine; firſt, Becauſe I hope it will be ſuch as will, generally, bear the ſtricteſt Scrutiny; and next, Becauſe, when my Actions fall ſhort of my Intentions, I preſume to hope your Ladyſhip will be as kind a Monitor to me, as you are a Correſpondent; and then I ſhall have an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to correct myſelf, and be, as near as my ſlender Talents will permit, what your Ladyſhip would have me to be.</p>
               <p>As the Letters I ſent before, and thoſe I now ſend, will let your Ladyſhip into ſeveral Particulars, ſuch as a brief Deſcription of the Houſe and Farm, and your honoured Brother's Intentions of retiring thither now-and-then; of the Happineſs and Gratitude of my dear Parents, and their Wiſhes to be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Comforts his Goodneſs has heaped upon them; and that in ſtronger Lights than I am able to ſet them; I will only, in a ſummary manner, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the reſt: And, particularly,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0272600703:64"/>That the Behaviour of my dear Benefactor to me, to my Parents, to Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> and to the Tenants, was one continued Series of Benignity and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion. He endeavoured, in every kind and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way, to encourage the good Couple to be free and chearful with him; and ſeeing them unable to get over that Awe and Reſpect which they owe him above all Mankind, and which they ſought to pay him on all Occaſions, he would take their Hands, and move than once called them by the neareſt and deareſt Names of Relationſhip, as if they were his own Parents; and I believe would have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd them oftener in this manner, but that he ſaw them too much affected with his Goodneſs to bear the Honour (as my dear Father ſays in his firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) with <hi>Equalneſs of Temper</hi>; and he ſeemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to delight in being particularly kind to them before Strangers, and before the Tenants, and before Mr. <hi>Sorby,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> three of the principal Gentlemen in the Neighbourhood, who, with their Ladies, came to viſit us, and whoſe Viſits we <hi>all</hi> returned; for your dear Brother would not permit my Father and Mother to decline the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of thoſe worthy Families.</p>
               <p>Judge you, my dear Lady, with what a Joy theſe kind Diſtinctions, and this ſweet Behaviour, muſt fill their honeſt Hearts: Judge of my grateful Sentiments and Acknowlegements on theſe hourly Inſtances of his Goodneſs; and judge of the Reſpect and Eſteem with which this muſt inſpire every one to the good Couple. And when once Mrs. <hi>Bennet</hi> had like to have ſaid ſomething of their former Condition, which ſhe would have recalled in ſome Confuſion, and when ſhe could not, apologized for it, the dear Gentleman ſaid, — All is well, Mrs. <hi>Bennet:</hi> No Apologies are neceſſary; and to ſhew you they are not, I'll tell you myſelf what you cannot have heard
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0272600703:65"/>
ſo particularly from others, and which were I to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to conceal, would be a Piece of Pride as ſtupid as deſpicable: So, in a conciſe manner, he gave them an Account of my Story, ſo much to my Advantage, and ſo little to his own, in the ingenuous Relation of his Attempts upon me, that you can't imagine, Madam, how much the Gentry were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by it, and how much, in particular, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded him for the Generoſity of his Actions to me and to my dear Parents. And your Ladyſhip will permit me to obſerve, that ſince the Matter is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced as it is, Policy, as well as Nobleneſs of Mind, obliged from the dear Gentleman this Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Acknowlegement; for having ſaid <hi>worſe</hi> of himſelf, and as mean of our Fortunes, as they could think, what remained for the Hearers but to <hi>applaud,</hi> when he had left them no Room to <hi>reproach,</hi> not ſo much as in Thought?</p>
               <p>Every Day we rode out, or walked a little about the Grounds; and while we were there, he employ'd Hands to cut a Viſta thro' a Coppice, as they call it, but rather a little Wood, to a riſing Ground, which fronting an old-faſhion'd Balcony in the Middle of the Houſe, he ordered it to be planted like a Grove, and a little Building to be erected on its Summit, in the Faſhion of an antient <hi>Greek</hi> Temple, of which he has ſent them a Draught, drawn by his own Hand, from one he had ſeen Abroad; and this, and a few other Alterations mentioned in my Letter to my Father, are to be finiſhed againſt we go down next.</p>
               <p>The dear Gentleman was every Hour preſſing me, while there, to take one Diverſion or other, frequently upbraiding me, that I ſeemed not to chuſe any thing; urging me to propoſe ſometimes what I could <hi>wiſh</hi> he ſhould oblige me in, and not always to leave it to him to chuſe for me; ſaying he was half-afraid, that my
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0272600703:66"/>
conſtant Compliance with every thing he propoſed, laid me ſometimes under a Reſtraint; and he would have me have a Will of my own, ſince it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that it could be ſuch as he ſhould not take a Delight in conforming to it.</p>
               <p>But, when (as I told him) his Favour for me made him rather ſtudy what was obliging to me, than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that he prevented all my Wiſhes by his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how was it poſſible for me not to receive with Pleaſure and Gratitude every Intimation from him, in ſuch a manner, as that tho' it might ſeem to be the Effect of an implicit Obedience to his Will, yet was it (nor could it be otherwiſe) intirely my own?</p>
               <p>I will not trouble your Ladyſhip with any further Particulars relating to this happy Fortnight, which was made up all of white and unclouded Days, to the very laſt; and your Ladyſhip will judge, better than I can deſcribe, what a Parting there was between my dear Parents, and their honoured Benefactor, and me.</p>
               <p>We ſet out, attended with the good Wiſhes of Crouds of Perſons of all Degrees; for your dear Brother left behind him noble Inſtances of his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it being the <hi>firſt</hi> Time, as he bid Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> ſay, that he had been down among them ſince that Eſtate had been in his Hands.</p>
               <p>But permit me, Madam, to obſerve, that I could not forbear often, very often, in this happy Period, thanking God in private, for the bleſſed Terms upon which I was there, to what I ſhould have been, had I graceleſly accepted of thoſe which once were tender'd to me; for your Ladyſhip will remember, that the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Eſtate was to be Part of the Purchace of my Infamy<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0272600703:67"/>We return'd thro' <hi>London</hi> again, by the like eaſy Journeys, but tarry'd not to ſee any thing of that vaſt Metropolis, any more than we did in going through it before; your beloved Brother only ſtopping at his Banker's, and deſiring him to look out for a handſome Houſe, which he purpoſes to take for his Winter Reſidence: He chuſes it to be about <hi>Soho-Square,</hi> or the new Buildings called <hi>Hanover-Square</hi>; and he left Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> there, to ſee one, which his Banker believed would be fit for him.</p>

               <p>Thus far, my dear Lady, the Relation I gave to my Parents, at the Time of my being firſt acquainted with this melancholy Affair.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0272600703:68"/>It is a great Pleaſure to me, that I can already flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf, from the Hints you kindly give me, that I behaved as you wiſhed I ſhould behave. Indeed, Madam, I could not help it; for I pitied moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely the unhappy Lady; and tho' I could not but rejoice, that I had had the Grace to eſcape the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Attempts of the dear Intriguer, yet never did the Story of any unfortunate Lady make ſuch an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon me as hers did: She loved <hi>him,</hi> and believed, no doubt, he loved <hi>her</hi> too well to take ungenerous Advantages of her ſoft Paſſion for him; and ſo, by Degrees, put herſelf in his Power; and too ſeldom, alas! have the nobleſt-minded of the ſeduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sex the Mercy or the Goodneſs to ſpare the poor Creatures that do!—And then this Love, to be ſure, is a ſad Thing, when once it is ſuffer'd to reign!— A perfect Tyrant!—requiring an unconditional Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to its arbitrary Dictates, and deeming every Inſtance of Diſcretion, and Prudence, and Virtue it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, too often, but as ſo many Acts of Rebellion to its uſurped Authority.</p>
               <p>And then, how do even Blemiſhes become Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in thoſe we love? Crimes themſelves too often, to inconſiderate Minds, appear but as human Failings; and human Failings are a <hi>common Cauſe,</hi> and always pardonable by human Frailty.</p>
               <p>Then 'tis another Misfortune of People in Love, they always think highly of the beloved Object, and lowly of themſelves; ſuch a diſmal Mortifier is Love!</p>
               <p>I ſay not this, Madam, to excuſe the poor Lady's Fall: Nothing can do that; becauſe Virtue is, and ought to be, preferable to all Conſiderations, and to Life itſelf. But methinks I love this dear Lady ſo well, for the ſake of her edifying Penitence, that I would fain extenuate her Crime, if I could; and the rather, as, in all Probability, it was a <hi>firſt Love</hi> on <hi>both</hi>

Sides; and ſo he could not appear to her as a <hi>practiſed</hi> Deceiver.</p>
               <p>Your Ladyſhip will ſee by what I have tranſcribed, how I behaved myſelf to the dear Miſs <hi>Goodwin</hi>; and I am ſo fond of the little Charmer, as well for the ſake of her unhappy Mother, tho' perſonally unknown to me, as for the Relation ſhe bears to the dear Gentleman whom I am bound to love and honour, that I muſt beg your Ladyſhip's Intereſt to procure her to be given up to my Care, when it ſhall be thought proper. I am ſure I ſhall act by her as tenderly, as if I was her own Mother.

               <p>I Now come to your Ladyſhip's Remarks on my Conduct to Mrs. <hi>Jewkes</hi>; which you are pleaſed to think too kind and forgiving, conſidering the poor Woman's Baſeneſs.</p>
               <p>Your Ladyſhip ſays,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"That I ought not to have borne her in my Sight, after the impudent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance ſhe gave to his lewd Attempts; much leſs to have left her in her Place, and rewarded her for her Vileneſs."</q>
Alas! my dear Lady, what could I do; a poor Priſoner, as I was made, for Weeks together, in Breach of all the Laws of Civil Society; not a Soul who durſt be my Friend; and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0272600703:70"/>
every Day expecting to be ruin'd and undone, by one of the haughtieſt and moſt determin'd Spirits in <hi>England?</hi> — And when it pleaſed GOD to turn his Heart, and incline him to abandon his wicked Attempts, and to profeſs honourable Love to me, his poor Servant, can it be thought I was to inſiſt upon Conditions with ſuch a Gentleman, who had me in his Power; and who, if I had provoked him, might have reſumed all his wicked Purpoſes againſt me?</p>
               <p>Indeed, I was too much overjoy'd, after all my Dangers paſt, (which were ſo great, that I could not go to Reſt, nor riſe, but with ſuch Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that I wiſh'd for Death rather than Life) to think of refuſing any Terms that I could yield to, and keep my Honour.</p>
               <p>And tho' ſuch noble Ladies, as your Ladyſhip and Lady <hi>Betty,</hi> who are born to Independency, and are hereditarily, as I may ſay, on a Foot with the higheſt-deſcended Gentleman in the Land, might have exerted Spirit, and would have had a Right to pick and chuſe your own Servants, and diſtribute Rewards and Puniſhments to the Deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Undeſerving, at your own good Pleaſure; yet what had I, a poor Girl, who ow'd my Title even to common Notice, to the Bounty of my late good Lady, and a kind of imputed Sightlineſs of Perſon, which had made me only the Subject of vile Attempts; who from a Situation of Terror and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion was lifted up to a Hope, beyond my higheſt Ambition, and was bid to pardon the bad Woman, as an Inſtance, that I could forgive his own hard Uſage of me; who had experienced ſo often the Violence and Impetuoſity of his Temper, which even his beloved Mother never reſiſted till it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided; and then indeed he was all Goodneſs and Acknowlegement, (of which I could give your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0272600703:71"/>
more than one Inſtance) what, I ſay, had I to do, to take upon me Lady-Airs, and reſent?</p>
               <p>But, my dear Ladies, (let me, in this Inſtance, beſpeak both your Ladyſhips Attention) I ſhould be inexcuſable, if I did not tell you all the Truth; and that is, that I not only forgave the poor Wretch, in regard to <hi>his Commands,</hi> but from <hi>my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I am wrong in ſaying this, I muſt ſubmit it to your Ladyſhips; and, as I pretend not to Perfection, am ready to take the Blame I ſhall be found to deſerve in your Ladyſhips Judgment; but indeed, were it to do again, I verily think, I could not help forgiving her. And were I not able to ſay this, I ſhould be thought to have made a mean Court to my Maſter's Paſſions, and to have done a wrong thing with my Eyes open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which, I humbly conceive, no one ſhould do.</p>
               <p>When this poor Creature was put into my Power, (ſeemingly at leaſt, tho' it might poſſibly have been reſum'd, and I might have been re-committed to hers, had I given him Reaſon to think I made an arrogant Uſe of it) you cannot imagine what a Triumph I had in my Mind on the mortify'd Guilt, which (from the higheſt Degree of Inſolence and Imperiouſneſs, that before harden'd her maſculine Features) appear'd in her Countenance, when ſhe found the Tables likely to be ſoon turn'd upon her.</p>
               <p>This Change of Behaviour, which at firſt operated in ſullen Awe, and afterwards in a kind of ſilent Reſpect, ſhew'd me, what an Influence Power had over her; and that when ſhe could treat her late Priſoner, when taken into Favour, ſo obſequiouſly, it was the leſs Wonder the bad Woman could think it her Duty to obey Commands ſo unjuſt, when her Obedience to them was required from her Maſter.</p>
               <p>To be ſure, if a Look could have killed her, after ſome of her bad Treatment, ſhe had been ſlain over
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0272600703:72"/>
and over, as I may ſay: But to me, who always was taught to diſtinguiſh between the Perſon and the Action, I could not hold my Reſentment againſt the poor paſſive Machine of Miſchief, one Day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, tho' her Actions were ſo odious to me.</p>
               <p>I ſhould indeed except that Time of my grand Trial, when ſhe appear'd ſo much a Wretch to me, that I ſaw her not (even after <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol. I <hi>p.</hi> 275.</note> two Days that ſhe was kept from my Sight) without great Flutter and Emotion of Heart; and I had repreſented to your Brother before, how hard a Condition it was for me to forgive ſo much unwomanly Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 277.</note>.</p>
               <p>But, my dear Ladies, when I conſider'd the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>one</hi> particular Light, I could the more eaſily forgive her; and <hi>having</hi> forgiven her, <hi>bear her in my Sight,</hi> and act by her (as a Conſequence of that Forgiveneſs) as if ſhe had not ſo horridly offended.— Elſe, how would it have been Forgiveneſs? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as ſhe was aſhamed of her Crime, and there was no Fear of a Repetition of it.</p>
               <p>Thus then I thought on the Occaſion: Poor wretched Agent, for Purpoſes little leſs than infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal! I <hi>will</hi> forgive thee, ſince <hi>thy</hi> Maſter and <hi>my</hi> Maſter will have it ſo. And indeed thou art beneath the Reſentment even of ſuch a poor Girl as I. I will <hi>pity</hi> thee, baſe and abject, as thou art. And ſhe who is the Object of my <hi>Pity,</hi> is ſurely beneath my <hi>Anger.</hi> My Eye, that uſed to quiver and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at thy haughty Eye, ſhall now, with conſcious Worthineſs, take a ſuperior Steadineſs, and look down thy ſcouling guilty one into Self-Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the State thou couldſt never caſt mine into, nor from it wilt be able to raiſe thine own! Bear the Reproach of thy own wicked Heart, low, vile
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0272600703:73"/>
Woman, unworthy as thou art of the <hi>Name,</hi> and choſen, as it ſhould ſeem, for a Foil to the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and to make Purity ſhine forth the brighter, the <hi>only</hi> good Uſe ſuch Wretches as thou can be of to others (except for Examples of Penitence and Mercy): This will be Puniſhment enough for thee, without my expoſing myſelf to the Imputation of deſcending ſo near to a Level with thee, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thy Baſeneſs, when thou haſt no Power to hurt me!—</p>
               <p>Such were then my Thoughts, my proud Thoughts, ſo far was I in my Heart, and, I hoped, in the very Act that proceeded from that Heart, from <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> Meanneſs in forgiving, at Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, the poor, low, creeping, abject, <hi>Self</hi>-morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, and <hi>Maſter</hi>-mortify'd Mrs. <hi>Jewkes</hi>!—</p>
               <p>And do you think, Ladies, when you revolve in your Thoughts, <hi>who</hi> I was, and <hi>what</hi> I was, and what I was deſigned to be; when you revolve the amazing Turn in my Favour, and the Proſpects before me (Proſpect ſo much above my Hope, that I left them intirely to Providence to direct for me, as it pleaſed, without daring to look forward to what thoſe Proſpect ſeemed naturally to tend); when I could ſee my haughty Perſecutor become my repentant Protector; the lofty Spirit that uſed to make me tremble, and to which I never could look up without Awe, except in thoſe animating Caſes, where his Guilt, and my Innocence, gave me a Courage, more than natural to my other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe daſtardly Heart: When this impetuous Spirit could ſtoop to requeſt one whom he had ſunk beneath even her uſual low Character of his Servant, and was his Priſoner, under Sentence of a Ruin worſe than Death, as he had intended it, and had ſeized her for that very Purpoſe, could ſtoop to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Vileneſs of thoſe Purpoſes: Could ſay,

               </p>
               <p>When I ſay, I was thus lifted up to the State of a ſovereign Forgiver, and my lordly Maſter became a Petitioner for himſelf, and for the guilty Creature, whom he put under my Feet; what a Triumph was here for the poor <hi>Pamela</hi>! And could I have been guilty of ſo mean a Pride, as to trample upon the poor abject Creature, when I found her thus lowly, thus mortify'd, and ſo much in my Power? For ſo ſhe actually was, while I ſeemed to think ſo: And would it have been good Manners with regard to my Maſter, or Policy with reſpect to mayſelf, to doubt it, after he had ſo declared? —</p>
               <p>Then, my dear Ladies, while I was injoying the Soul-charming Fruits of that Innocence which the Divine Grace had inabled me to preſerve, in ſpite of ſo many Plots and Contrivances on my <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Side, and ſuch wicked Inſtigations, and Aſſiſtances on hers, and all my Proſpects were improving upon me beyond my Wiſhes; when all was Sunſhine, unclouded Sunſhine, and I poſſeſſed my Mind in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0272600703:75"/>
Peace, and had nothing to do but to be thankful to Providence, which had been ſo gracious to my Unworthineſs; when I ſaw, as I ſaid above, my Perſecutor become my Protector, my active Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, no longer my Enemy, but creeping, with flow, doubtful Feet, and ſpeaking to me, with awful heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Doubt of my Acceptation; a Stamp of an inſolent Foot, turned into court'fying half-bent Knees; threatening Hands into ſupplicating Folds; and the Eye unpitying to Innocence, running over with the Senſe of her own Guilt, a faltering Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent on her late menacing Tongue, and uplifted Handkerchief,—
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I ſee ſhe will be my Lady: And then I know how it will go with me <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>See</hi> Vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 285.</note>;"</q>
—Was not this, my Ladies, a Triumph of Triumphs to the late miſerable, now exalted <hi>Pamela?</hi>—Could I do leſs than pardon her? And having declared, that I did ſo, was I not to ſhew the Sincerity of my Declaration?</p>
               <p>Indeed, indeed, my dear good Ladies, I found ſuch a Subject for Exultation in this providential Change of my Condition, that I had much ado to ſubdue my riſing Pride, and thought there was more Danger of being lifted up, (every Moment, to ſee ſuch improving Contrition on the poor Creature's Part) than to be ſuppoſed guilty of a Meanneſs of Heart, in <hi>ſtooping</hi> (yes. Madam, that was then the proudly proper Word, in the Elevation wherein I found myſelf) to forgive her! — And, what! ſhould I not forgive a Creature for that very Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which, happily withſtood, had ſo largely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to exalt me? Indeed, my dear good Ladies, permit me to repeat, I could not chuſe but to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give her! — How could I?—And would it not have been out of Character in me, and againſt all
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0272600703:76"/>
Expectation of my high-ſoul'd (tho' ſometimes, as in my Caſe, for a great while together, meanly-acting) Maſter, if I had not? —</p>
               <p>Would it not have ſhewn him, that the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born <hi>Pamela</hi> was incapable of a generous Action, had ſhe refuſed the <hi>only</hi> Requeſt her humble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had given her the Opportunity of granting, at that time, with Innocence? Would he not have thought the humble Cottager as capable of Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and Vengeance too, in her Turn, as the better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born? And that ſhe wanted but the Power, to ſhew that unrelenting Temper by which ſhe had ſo griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſuffer'd?—And might not this have given him Room to think me (and to have reſumed and proſecuted his Purpoſes accordingly) fitter for an arrogant kept Miſtreſs, than an humble and obliged Wife? —</p>
               <p>I ſee, (might he not have ſaid?) the Girl has ſtrong Paſſions and Reſentments; and ſhe that has, will be <hi>acted,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>govern'd,</hi> by them.— I will improve upon the Hint ſhe herſelf has now given me, by her inexorable Temper: — I will gratify her Revenge, till I turn it upon herſelf: I will indulge her Pride, till I make it adminiſter to her Fall: For a Wife I cannot think of, in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Cottager; eſpecially when ſhe has lurking in her all the Pride and Arrogance (you know, my Ladies, his haughty way of ſpeaking of our Sex) of the better-deſcended. — And by a little Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and watching her unguarded Hours, and applying Temptations to her Paſſions, I ſhall firſt diſcover them, and then make my Advantage of them.—</p>
               <p>Might not this have been the Language, and this the Reſolution, of ſuch a dear wicked Intriguer?— For, my Lady, you can hardly conceive the Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles he apparently had to bring down his high Spirit
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0272600703:77"/>
to ſo humble a Level. And tho', I hope, all would have been, even in this <hi>worſt</hi> Caſe, ineffectual, thro' Divine Grace, yet how do I know what lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vileneſs might have appeared by Degrees in this frail Heart, to have incouraged his Deſigns, and to have augmented my Trials and my Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? And perhaps downright Violence might have been uſed, if he could not on one hand have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd his Paſſion, nor on the other, have overcome his Pride. A Pride, that every one, reflecting upon the Diſparity of Birth and Condition between us, would have dignify'd with the Name of <hi>Decency</hi>; a Pride that was become ſuch an eſſential Part of the dear Gentleman's Character, in this Inſtance of a Wife, that altho' he knew he could not keep it up, if he made <hi>me</hi> happy, yet it was no ſmall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in his chuſing me, in one reſpect, becauſe he expected from me more Humility, more Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, than he thought he had Reaſon to flatter himſelf would be paid him, by a Lady equally born and educated: And of this I will ſend your Ladyſhip an Inſtance, in a Tranſcription from that Part of <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>I hope, from what I have ſaid, it will appear to your Ladyſhip, and to Lady <hi>Betty</hi> too, that I am juſtify'd, or at leaſt excuſable, in pardoning Mrs. <hi>Jewkes:</hi> And I have yet another Reaſon behind, for doing ſo, had ſhe been as abſolutely in my Power, as the Wiſh of the moſt reſenting Perſon in the World could have made her; and that is, the Hope I had, that the poor Creature, by being continued in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily where the Gentleman gave Hopes of ſo deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Reformation, and where the Example of the Perſon he was about to honour in ſo eminent a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, beyond all that could have been hoped for by her a few Days before, might, poſſibly contribute to make her change her Manner of Thinking, as well as Acting.</p>
               <p>I looked upon the poor Wretch, in all her Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me, in my Days of Trial, as one devoted to Perdition, by her own Act and Deed; as one who
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0272600703:79"/>
had no Regard to a future State, and who, while ſhe could live in Eaſe and Plenty for a wretched poor Term of Years, the Remainder of an ill-ſpent Life, cared not what ſhe did, and was ready to undertake any thing which Perſons of Power and Riches would put her upon: That even were ſhe to be turned off diſgracefully, at my Deſire, beſides ſhewing myſelf to be of an implacable Spirit, which ſome People would have imputed to right, ſome to wrong Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as they favoured me or not, ſhe might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by ſome proſtigate Perſons, to whoſe Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuch a Woman might be uſeful; and that then her Power to do Miſchief might be augmented, and ſhe might go on more ſucceſsfully to do the Devil'; Work, and ſeveral innocent Creatures might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, like ſo many thoughtleſs Flies, in the inſnaring Web of this venomous-hearted Spider, which I had ſo happily eſcaped. Is it not better then, thought I, if I can impreſs <hi>Conviction</hi> upon the poor Wretch, whom its hopeful Forerunner <hi>Shame</hi> had already taken hold of, and add the delightful Hope of Miſchiefs prevented, to that of a Soul reclaimed ? And may not I, who have been ſo hardly uſed by her, for <hi>that</hi> very Reaſon, have more Influence upon her, than any other Perſon, even the beſt of Divines, could have? — When <hi>I</hi> talk to her in a virtuous Way, will ſhe not ſee, that I talk from <hi>Example,</hi> (pardon my Preſumption, Madam, in ſaying ſo) as well as <hi>Precept?</hi> (Will ſhe not ſee, that thoſe Principles muſt proceed from a right Direction, a Direction <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> of being followed, which could make a Sufferer by her, forgive as readily as ſhe could err; and in Hopes of reclaiming her to the Paths of Virtue, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that ſhe was either her Enemy or her Superior, tho' the one ſhe had Reaſon to apprehend, and the other ſhe ſaw I was become?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0272600703:80"/>Nay, would not this Behaviour of mine, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, operate on a much higher and nobler Subject, her dear naughty Maſter, and let <hi>him</hi> ſee the Force and Amiableneſs of a virtuous Habit? that there muſt be ſomething in thoſe Laws, that could make ſo young a Creature purſue them, in an Inſtance ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to ſome Minds, (and eſpecially to the Paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and High-born) that of forgiving Injuries, when in one's Power to reſent, and of returning Good for Evil?</p>
               <p>And then, when no ſullen Behaviour to the poor Wretch, on my Side, took Place; no diſtant Airs were affected, no angry Brow put on, nor Sharpneſs of Speech, to one who might expect all theſe from me; would it not ſhew him, that I was ſincere in my Forgiveneſs? that I was not able to bear Malice? was a Stranger to Revenge? had truly that Softneſs of Nature, and Placableneſs of Diſpoſition, which he would wiſh for in a Perſon he thought to honour; which he holds to be the greateſt Merit in our Sex; and which, I dare ſay, your Ladyſhip will join with me in Opinion, is indiſpenſably neceſſary for a happy Life in the Perſon who is his Wife?</p>
               <p>Then I have no Notion of that ſlight Diſtinction I have ſo often heard, between <hi>forgive</hi> and <hi>forget,</hi> when Perſons have a mind to ſplit Hairs, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh away their Chriſtian Duties by a Word, and ſay, I <hi>muſt forgive ſuch an Action, but I will never forget it:</hi> When I would rather ſay, <hi>I will remember ſuch an Action, in order for my future Guard</hi>; but <hi>I will forgive it as often as I remember it, or elſe I will try to forget it for ever, if it will occaſion a Breach in my Chriſtian Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After what I have ſaid, I will not name leſſer Conſiderations, ſuch as that of my being forced to accompany with the poor Woman, and my being deſtitute of the Company of my own Sex, but of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0272600703:81"/>
ſuch as were too inferior and ſtupid for me to take Notice of, in the Proſpect before me.</p>
               <p>But one thing I may mention further: Might it not, Ladies, be right, that by keeping her, I ſhould make the World think, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had not gone ſuch very wicked Lengths, as would have been ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, if ſhe had not been ſupportable to me in the ſame Houſe? Which, moreover, thoſe Perſons, who might not know thoſe Reaſons which it was not to your dear Brother's Credit to give, might have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to me as Arrogance, or Revenge; and ſo brought ſtill greater Diſgrace upon the Choice he had made of me, as if I would take as much upon me, as tho' I were to be the Obliger inſtead of the Obliged; and who knows, beſides, what ſhe might have reported of both, had ſhe been diſmiſſed?</p>
               <p>How then, deareſt Ladies, if theſe Conſiderations have any Weight, could I act otherwiſe than I did, either with reſpect to your honoured Brother, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or the poor Woman? And when I tell your Ladyſhip, that I have all the Reaſon in the World to be pleaſed with this Manner of Acting, in the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it has given me with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and his good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Sincerity of my Charity, and (in what I was very deſirous of) its Effects upon the poor Woman, I dare ſay, both your Ladyſhips Opinions will be in my Favour on this Head.</p>
               <p>But your dear Brother has juſt ſent me Word, that Supper waits for me; and the Poſt, moreover, being going off, I defer till the next Opportunity what I have to ſay as to theſe good Effects; and am, mean time,</p>

               <p>IT is needful, in order to let you more intelligibly into the Subject where I left off in my laſt, that your Ladyſhip ſhould know, that your generous Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has made me his Almoner, as I was my late dear Lady's; and has order'd Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> to pay me 50 <hi>l.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol. II. <hi>p.</hi> 342.</note> Quarterly, for Purpoſes of which he requires no Account, tho' I have one always <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 352.</note> ready to produce; and he has given me other Sums to inable me to do all the Good I can to diſtreſſed Objects, at my firſt ſetting out. Thus inabled, your Ladyſhip knows not how many honeſt Hearts I have made glad already, and how many I hope to rejoice before a Year is at an End, and yet come within my Limits.</p>
               <p>Now, Madam, as I knew Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> was far from being eaſy in her Circumſtances, thinking her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to pay old <note n="‡" place="bottom">Vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 92.</note> Debts for two extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Children who are both dead; and maintaining in Schooling and Cloaths three of their Children, which always keeps her bare; I took upon me one Day, as ſhe and I ſat together, at our Needles, to ſay to her, (as we are always running over old Stories, when we are alone) My good Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> will you allow me to ask you after your own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Affairs, and if you are tolerably eaſy in them?</p>
               <p>You are very good, Madam, ſaid ſhe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern yourſelf about my poor Matters, ſo much as you have to imploy your Thoughts about, and ſo much as every Moment of your Time is taken up from the Hour you riſe, to the Time of your Reſt.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0272600703:94"/>
But I can with great Pleaſure attribute it to your Bounty, and that of my honoured Maſter, that I am eaſier and eaſier every Day.</p>
               <p>But tell me, my dear Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> ſaid I, how your Matters <hi>particularly</hi> ſtand. I love to mingle Concerns with my Friends, and as I hide nothing from <hi>you,</hi> I hope you'll treat <hi>me</hi> with equal Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for I always loved you, and always will; and nothing but Death ſhall divide our Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>She had Tears of Gratitude in her Eyes, and taking off her Spectacles, I cannot bear, ſaid ſhe, ſo much Goodneſs! — Oh! my Lady! —</p>
               <p>Oh! my <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſay, reply'd I.—How often muſt I chide you for calling me any thing but your <hi>Pamela,</hi> when we are alone together? —</p>
               <p>My Heart, ſaid ſhe, will burſt with your Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! — I cannot bear it!—</p>
               <p>But you <hi>muſt</hi> bear it, and bear ſtill worſe Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes to your grateful Heart, I can tell you that: A pretty thing, truly! Here, I a poor helpleſs Girl, raiſed from Poverty and Diſtreſs, by the Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the beſt of Gentlemen, only becauſe I was young and ſightly, ſhall put on Lady-Airs to a Gentlewoman born, the Wiſdom of whoſe Years, and her faithful Services, and good Management, make her a much greater Merit in this Family, than I can pretend to have! — And return, ſhall I? in the Day of my Power, Inſult and Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſs for the Kindneſs and Benevolence I received from her in that of my Indigence! — Indeed, I won't forgive you my dear Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> if I think you capable of looking upon me in any other Light than as your Daughter; for you have been a Mother to me, when the Abſence of my own could not afford me the Comfort, and good Counſel, I received every Day from you.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0272600703:95"/>Then moving my Chair nearer her, and taking her Hand, and wiping, with my Handkerchief in my o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her, her reverend Cheek, Come, come, my dear ſecond Mother, ſaid I, call me your Daughter, your <hi>Pamela:</hi> I have paſſed many ſweet Hours with you under that Name: And as I have but too ſeldom ſuch an Opportunity as this, open to me your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Heart, and let me know, if I cannot make my <hi>ſecond</hi> Mother as eaſy and happy, as our dear Maſter has made my <hi>firſt?</hi> —</p>
               <p>She hung her Head on her Shoulder, and I waited till the Diſcharge of her Tears gave Time for Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance to her Words; provoking only her Speech, by ſaying, You uſed to have Three Grandchildren to provide for in Cloaths and Schooling. They are all living, I hope?</p>
               <p>Yes, Madam, they are living: And your laſt Bounty (Twenty Guineas was a great Sum, and all at once!) made me very eaſy, and very happy!—</p>
               <p>How eaſy, and how happy, Mrs. <hi>Jervis?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, my dear Lady, I paid Five to one old Creditor of my unhappy Sons; Five to a ſecond; and Two-and-an-half to two others, in Proportion to their reſpective Demands; and with the other Five I paid off all Arrears of the poor Childrens Schooling and Maintenance, and every one is ſatisfy'd and eaſy, and all declare they will never do harſh Things by me, if they are paid no more.</p>
               <p>But, tell me, Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> what you owe in the World, put all together; and you and I will contrive, with Juſtice to our beſt Friend, to do all we can, to make you quite eaſy; for, at your Time of Life, I cannot bear, that you ſhall have any thing to diſturb you, which I can remove; and ſo my dear Mrs. <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> let me know all.</p>
               <p>Come, I know your Debts, (dear, juſt, good Woman, as you are!) like <hi>David</hi>'s Sins, are ever
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0272600703:96"/>
before you: So come, putting my Hand in her Pocket, let me be a friendly Pick-pocket: Let me take out your Memorandum-Book, and we will ſee how all Matters ſtand, and what can be done. Come, I ſee you are too much moved; your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Heart is too much affected (pulling out her Book, which ſhe always has about her): I will go to my Cloſet, and return preſently.</p>
               <p>So I left her to recover her Spirits, and retir'd with the good Woman's Book to my Cloſet.</p>
               <p>Your dear Brother ſtepping into the Parlour juſt after I had gone out, Where's your Lady, Mrs. <hi>Jervis?</hi> ſaid he; and being told, came up to me, What ails the good Woman below, my Dear? ſaid he: I hope you and ſhe have had no Words!</p>
               <p>No, indeed, Sir, anſwer'd I. — If we had, I am ſure it would have been my Fault: But I have picked her Pocket of her Memorandum-Book, in order to look into her private Affairs, to ſee if I cannot, with Juſtice to our common Benefactor, make her as eaſy as you, Sir, have made my other dear Parents.</p>
               <p>A Bleſſing, ſaid the dear Gentleman, upon my Charmer's benevolent Heart! — I will leave every thing to your Diſcretion, my Dear! — Do all the Good you prudently can to your Mrs. <hi>Jervis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I claſped my bold Arms about him, the ſtarting Tear teſtifying my Gratitude: Deareſt, dear Sir, ſaid I, you affect me as much, as I did Mrs. <hi>Jervis:</hi> And if any one but you had a Right to ask, What ails your <hi>Pamela?</hi> as you do, What ails Mrs. <hi>Jervis?</hi> I muſt ſay, I am hourly ſo much oppreſs'd by your Goodneſs, that there is hardly any bearing one's own Joy.</p>
               <p>He ſaluted me, and ſaid, I was a dear obliging Creature. But, ſaid he, I came to tell you, that after we have din'd, we'll take a Turn, if you pleaſe,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0272600703:97"/>
to Lady <hi>Arthur</hi>'s: She has a Family of <hi>London</hi> Friends for her Gueſts, and begs I will prevail upon you to give her your Company, and attend you myſelf, only to drink Tea with her; for I have told her, we are to have Friends to ſup with us.</p>
               <p>I will attend you, Sir, reply'd I, moſt willingly; altho' I doubt I am to be made a Shew of.</p>
               <p>Something like it, ſaid he — For ſhe has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd them this Favour.</p>
               <p>I need not dreſs otherwiſe than I am?</p>
               <p>No, he was pleaſed to ſay, I was always what he wiſhed me to be.</p>
               <p>So he left me to my <hi>good Works,</hi> (thoſe were his kind Words) and I ran over Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and found a Balance drawn of all her Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in one Leaf, in a very clear manner, and a thankful Acknowlegement to God, for her Maſter's laſt Bounty,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"which had inabled her to give Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to others, and do herſelf great Pleaſure,"</q> as ſhe had written underneath.</p>
               <p>The Balance of all was 35 <hi>l.</hi> 11 <hi>s.</hi> and odd Pence; and I went to my Eſcritoire, and took out 40 <hi>l.</hi> and down I haſted to my good Mrs. <hi>Jervis.</hi> And I ſaid, to her, Here, my dear good Friend, is your Pocket-Book; but are 35 or 36 <hi>l.</hi> all you owe or are bound for in the World?</p>
               <p>It is, Madam, ſaid ſhe, and enough too. It is a great Sum; but 'tis in Four Hands, and they are all in pretty good Circumſtances; and ſo convinced of my Honeſty, that they will never trouble me for it; for I have reduced the Debt every Year ſomething, ſince I have been in my Maſter's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhall it ever be in any Body's <hi>Power,</hi> ſaid I, to trouble you. I'll tell you how we'll order it.</p>
               <p>So I ſat down and made her ſit down by me, Here, my dear Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> is 40 <hi>l.</hi> It is not ſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0272600703:98"/>
much to me now, as the <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 92.</note> Two Guineas were to you, that you would have given me, if I would have accepted of them, at my going away from this Houſe, to my Father's, as I thought. But I will not <hi>give</hi> it you neither, at leaſt at <hi>preſent,</hi> as you ſhall hear: Indeed I won't make you ſo uneaſy as that comes to. But here take this, and pay the Thirty-five Pounds odd Money to the utmoſt Farthing; and the remaining Four Pounds odd will be a little Fund in Advance towards the Childrens Schooling. And thus you ſhall repay it. I always deſigned, as our dear Maſter added Five Guineas <hi>per Annum</hi> to your Salary, in Acknowlegement of the Pleaſure he took in your Services, when I was <hi>Pamela Andrews,</hi> to add Five Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to it from the Time I became Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> But from that time, for ſo many Years to come, you ſhall receive no more than you did, till the whole Forty Pounds be repaid. And ſo, my dear Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> you won't have any Obligation to me, you know, but for the Advance; and that is a poor Matter, not to be ſpoken of: And I will have Leave for it, for fear I ſhould die.</p>
               <p>Had your Ladyſhip ſeen the good dear Woman's Behaviour on this Occaſion, you would never have forgot it. She could not ſpeak: Tears ran down her Cheeks in plentiful Currents: her modeſt Hand put gently from her my offering Hand, and her Boſom heav'd, and ſhe ſobb'd with the painful Tumult that ſeem'd to ſtruggle within her, and, which for ſome few Moments, made her incapable of ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>At laſt, I riſing, and putting my Arm round her Neck, and wiping her Eyes, and kiſſing her Cheek, ſhe cry'd, My dear, my excellent Lady! 'tis too much! too much! I cannot bear all this—And then ſhe threw herſelf at my Feet; for I was not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0272600703:99"/>
ſtrong enough to hinder it, and with uplifted Hands, May God Almighty, ſaid ſhe — I kneeled by her, and claſping her Hands in mine, both uplifted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether — May God Almighty, ſaid I, drowning her Voice with my louder Voice, bleſs us both together, for many happy Years! and may He bleſs and reward the dear Gentleman who has thus inabled me to make <hi>the Widow's Heart to ſing for Joy!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dear, good Woman, ſaid I, riſing, and raiſing her, Do you think you ſhall outdo me in Prayers and Praiſes to the Fountain of all our Mercies?—Do you think you ſhall?— And while I am impower'd to do Good to ſo many worthy Objects <hi>abroad,</hi> ſhall I forget to make my dear Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> happy at <hi>home?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus, my Lady, did I force upon the good Woman's Acceptance the Forty Pounds.</p>

               <p>I NOW reſume my laſt Subject where I left off, that your Ladyſhip may have the Whole before you at one View.</p>
               <p>I went after Dinner, with my dear Benefactor, to Lady <hi>Arthur</hi>'s; and met with freſh Calls upon me for Humility, having the too natural Effects of the Praiſes and proſeſſed Admiration of that Lady's Gueſts, as well as my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s, and thoſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0272600703:100"/>
of Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Arthur,</hi> to guard myſelf againſt: And your good Brother was pleaſed to entertain me in the Chariot, going and coming, with an Account of the Orders he had given in relation to the <hi>London</hi> Houſe, which is actually taken, and the Furniture he ſhould direct for it; ſo that I had no Opportunity to tell him what I had done in relation to Mrs. <hi>Jervis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after Supper, retiring from Company to my Cloſet, when his Friends were gone, he came up to me about our uſual Bed-time: He inquired kindly after my Imployment, which was trying to read in the <hi>French Telemachus:</hi> For, my Lady, I am learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>French,</hi> I'll aſſure you! And who, do you think, is my Maſter? — Why, the beſt I <hi>could</hi> have in the World, your deareſt Brother, who is pleaſed to ſay I am no Dunce: How inexcuſable ſhould I be, if I was, with ſuch a Maſter, who teaches me on his Knee, and rewards me with a Kiſs whenever I do well, and ſays, I have already nearly maſter'd the Accent and Pronunciation, which he tells me is a great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty got over.</p>
               <p>I requeſted him to render for me into <hi>Engliſh</hi> two or three Places that were beyond my Reach; and when he had done it, he asked me, in <hi>French,</hi> What I had done for Mrs. <hi>Jervis?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaid, Permit me, Sir, (for I am not Proficient enough to anſwer you in my new Tongue) in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to ſay, I have made the good Woman quite happy; and if I have your Approbation, I ſhall be as much ſo myſelf in this Inſtance, as I am in all others.</p>
               <p>I dare anſwer for your Prudence, my Dear, he was pleaſed to ſay; but this is your Favourite: Let me know, when you have ſo bountiful a Heart to Strangers, what you do for your Favourites?</p>
               <p>I then ſaid, Permit my bold Eye, Sir, to watch yours, as I obey you; and you know you muſt turn from me then, or elſe how ſhall I look you in the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0272600703:101"/>
Face? how ſee, as I proceed, whether you are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed? for you will not chide me in Words, ſo partial have you the Goodneſs to be to all my Foibles.</p>
               <p>He put his Arm round my Waiſt, and looked down now-and-then, as I deſired; for, O Madam, he is all Condeſcenſion and Goodneſs to his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy yet grateful <hi>Pamela!</hi> And I told him all I have written to your Ladyſhip about the Forty Pounds.— And now, dear Sir, ſaid I, half hiding my Face on his Boſom, you have heard what I have done, chide or beat your <hi>Pamela,</hi> if you pleaſe: It ſhall be all kind from you, and Matter of future Direction and Caution.</p>
               <p>He raiſed my Head, and kiſſed me two or three times, ſaying, Thus then I chide, I beat, my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel!—And yet I have one Fault to find with you; and let Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> if not in Bed, come up to us, and hear what it is; for I will <hi>expoſe</hi> you as you deſerve before her. My <hi>Polly</hi> being in Hearing, attending to know if I wanted her Aſſiſtance to undreſs, I bad her call Mrs. <hi>Jervis.</hi> And tho' I thought from his kind Looks, and kind Words, as well as tender Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, that I had not much to fear, yet I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to know what my Fault was, for which I was ſo to be expoſed.</p>
               <p>The good Woman came, and as ſhe enter'd with all that Modeſty which is ſo graceful in her, he moved his Chair further from me, and, with a ſet Aſpect, but not unpleaſant, ſaid, — Step in, Mrs. <hi>Jervis:</hi> Your Lady (for ſo, Madam, he will always call me to Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> and the Servants) has incurred my Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and I would not tell her in what, till I had you Face to Face.</p>
               <p>She look'd ſurpris'd — now on me, now on her dear Maſter; and I, not knowing what he would ſay, looked a little attentive.—I am ſorry—I am very
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0272600703:102"/>
ſorry for it, Sir! ſaid ſhe, court'ſying low. — But ſhould be more ſorry, if <hi>I</hi> were the unhappy Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Why, Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> I can't ſay but it is on your Account that I muſt blame her.</p>
               <p>This gave us both Confuſion, but eſpecially the good Woman; for ſtill I hoped much from his kind Behaviour to me juſt before.—And ſhe ſaid, Indeed Sir, I could never deſerve—</p>
               <p>He interrupted her, My Charge againſt you, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela,</hi> ſaid he, is that of Niggardlineſs, and no other; for I will put you both out of your Pain: You ought not to have found out the Method of Repayment.</p>
               <p>The dear Creature, ſaid he, to Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom does any thing that can be mended; but, I think, when your good Conduct deſerved an annual Acknowlegement from me, in Addition to your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, the Lady ſhould have ſhewed herſelf no leſs pleaſed with your Service, than the Gentleman.— Had it been for old Acquaintance-ſake, for Sex-ſake, ſhe ſhould not have given me Cauſe to upbraid her on this Head. — But I will tell you, that you muſt look upon the Forty Pounds you have, as the Effect of a juſt Diſtinction on many Accounts; and your Salary from laſt Quarter-day ſhall be advanced, as the dear Niggard intended it ſome Years hence; and let me only add, that when my <hi>Pamela</hi> firſt begins to ſhew a Coldneſs to her Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> I ſhall then ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſhe is beginning to decline in that humble Virtue which is now peculiar to herſelf, and makes her the Delight of all who converſe with her.</p>
               <p>This was what he was pleaſed to <hi>ſay:</hi> Thus, with the moſt graceful Generoſity, and a Nobleneſs of Mind <hi>truly</hi> peculiar to himſelf, was he pleaſed to <hi>act:</hi> And what, does your Ladyſhip think, could Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> or I ſay to him? — Why indeed nothing at all!—We could only look upon one another, with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0272600703:103"/>
our Eyes full, and our Hearts full, of a Gratitude that would not permit either of us to ſpeak, but which expreſs'd itſelf at laſt in a Manner he was pleaſed to call more elegant than Words, and that was, with uplifted folded Hands, and Tears of Joy.</p>
               <p>Oh my dear Lady! how many Opportunities have the beneficent <hi>Rich</hi> to make <hi>themſelves,</hi> as well as their <hi>Fellow-creatures,</hi> happy! All that I could think, or ſay, or act, was but my Duty before; what a Senſe of Obligation then muſt I lie under to this moſt generous of Men!</p>
               <p>But here let me put an End to this tedious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; the principal Part of which can have no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, if it may not ſerve as a Proof of my chearful Compliance with your Ladyſhip's Commands, That I recite <hi>every</hi> thing that is of Concern to me, and with the ſame Freedom as I was wont to do to my dear Parents.</p>
               <p>I have done it, and at the ſame time have offer'd what I had to plead in Behalf of my Conduct to the two Houſekeepers, which you expected from me; and I ſhall therefore cloſe this my humble Defence, if I may ſo call it, with the Aſſurance that I am,</p>

               <p>Why, you dear charming <hi>Pamela,</hi> did you only exceed me in <hi>Words,</hi> I could forgive you; for there may be a Knack, and a Volubility, as to <hi>Words,</hi> that a natural Talent may ſupply; but to be thus outdone in <hi>Thought</hi> and in <hi>Deed,</hi> who can bear it? and in ſo young an Inſulter too!</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>Pamela,</hi> look to it, when I ſee you: You ſhall feel the Weight of my Hand, or—the Preſſure of my Lip, one or t'other, depend on it, very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: For here, inſtead of my ſtooping, as I had thought it would be, to call <hi>you</hi> Siſter, I ſhall be forced to think in a little while, that you ought not to own <hi>me</hi> as <hi>yours,</hi> till I am nearer your Standard.</p>
               <p>But to come to Buſineſs. I will ſummarily take Notice of the following Particulars in all your obliging Letters, in order to convince you of my Friendſhip, by the Freedom of my Obſervations on the Subjects you touch upon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then, I am highly pleaſed with what you write of the Advantages you received from the Favour of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0272600703:105"/>
my dear Mother; and as you know many Things of her by your Attendance upon her, in the laſt three or four Years of her Life, I muſt deſire you will give me, as Opportunity ſhall offer, all you can recollect in relation to the honoured Lady, and of her Behaviour and Kindneſs to you, and with a Retroſpect to your own early Beginnings, the Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this your bright Day of Excellence: And this not only I, but the Counteſs, and Lady <hi>Betty,</hi> (her Siſter Lady <hi>Jenny</hi> too) with whom I am going over your Papers again, requeſt of you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I am much pleaſed with your <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; tho' we wiſhed you had been more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in ſome Parts of it; for we are greatly taken with your Deſcriptions, and your Converſation Pieces: Yet I own, your honeſt Father's Letters, and yours, a good deal ſupply that <hi>Defect,</hi> as our Pleaſure in reading your Relations makes us call it. Your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are honeſt, diſcreet Folks, I ſee that: I have a Value for them. And you're the prudenteſt Creature I ever knew, in all your Ways; particularly in the Advice you give them about your more diſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and to aim at nothing beyond their natural Sphere.—Every Tittle is right, and as it ſhould be. On theſe Accounts it is, that all the World will allow, that you, and your Parents too, merit the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune you have met with.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I am highly delighted with the Account you give me of my Brother's breaking to you the Affair of <hi>Sally Godfrey,</hi> and your Conduct upon it. 'Tis a ſweet Story, as he brought it on, and as you relate it. The Wretch has been very juſt in his Account of it. But don't you think he was a ſad young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low! Well may you be thankful for <hi>your</hi> Eſcape; well may you!—Your Behaviour was what I admire; and ſo we do all; but none of us think we could have imitated it in all its Parts. We are in Love
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0272600703:106"/>
with your charitable Reflections in favour of the poor Lady; and the more, as ſhe certainly deſerved them; and a better Mother too than ſhe had, and a faithfuller Lover, than ſhe met with.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You have exactly hit his Temper, in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Love of Miſs. I ſee, Child, you know your Man; and never fear but you'll hold him, if you can go on thus to act, and outdo your Sex. But I ſhould think you might as well not inſiſt upon having Miſs with you; for the Girl may be pert, perhaps inſolent (you know who is her Father); you'd not care to check her, for ſeveral Reaſons, and this may make you uneaſy; for, if you <hi>did,</hi> he might take it amiſs, let your Motives be ever ſo good: So I think you'd better ſee her now-and-then at the Dairy-houſe, or at School, than have her with you. — But this I leave to your own Diſcretion, and <hi>his</hi> good Pleaſure, to determine upon; for in the latter it muſt reſt, let you, or me, or any body, ſay what we will.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You have fully, and to our Satisfaction, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd our Objections to your Behaviour to Mrs. <hi>Jewkes.</hi> We had not conſidered your Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances quite ſo thoroughly as we ought to have done. You are a charming Girl, and all your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are ſo juſt, that we ſhall be a little more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious for the future how we cenſure you. We are particularly pleaſed with the Triumphs of your Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence over his and her Guilt; and agree, that they are the righteſt and beſt-to-be-defended Motives for Pride that ever were ſet before us.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, I ſay with the Counteſs, This good Girl is not without her Pride; but it is the Pride that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, and can only attend, the innocent Heart; and I'll warrant, ſaid her Ladyſhip, nobody will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her Station ſo well as one who is capable of ſo worthy a Pride as this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0272600703:107"/>But what a Curtain-Lecture hadſt thou, <hi>Pamela!</hi> A noble one, doſt thou call it! — Why, what a Wretch haſt thou got, to expect thou ſhouldſt never expoſtulate againſt his lordly Will, even when in the Wrong, till thou haſt obey'd it, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence join'd in the Evil he impoſes! He ſays, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in <hi>ſmall</hi> Points; but I ſuppoſe he is to judge which are and which are not ſmall.</p>
               <p>Thus, I remember, my Brother himſelf took No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice once of a Propoſal in the Houſe of Commons, to grant the Crown a very great Sum to anſwer Civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Liſt Deficiencies, which being oppoſed by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, the Miniſter found out an Expedient, that they would give the Money <hi>firſt,</hi> and examine into the Merits of the Demand <hi>afterwards.</hi> So we read, that, in ſome Countries, an accuſed Perſon is put to Death, and try'd afterwards; and all he has to hope for while he lives, is, that his Relations, and his own Family, will be releaſed from Obloquy, if an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal enſues.</p>
               <p>Much good may do you with ſuch an Husband, ſays Lady <hi>Betty!</hi>—Every body will <hi>admire</hi> you, but no one will have Reaſon to <hi>envy</hi> you upon thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Yet, I don't know how it is, but this is evident, that at preſent there is not a happier Couple in the World than you two are.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I am pleaſed with your Promiſe of ſending me what you think I ſhall like to ſee, out of thoſe Papers you chuſe not to ſhew me collectedly: This is very obliging. You're a good Girl, and I love you dearly.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We have all ſmiled at your Paradox, <hi>Pamela,</hi> that his marrying <hi>you</hi> was an Inſtance of his Pride. The Thought, tho', is pretty enough, and ingenious: But whether it will hold or not, I won't juſt now examine.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0272600703:108"/>8. Your Obſervation on the <hi>Forget</hi> and <hi>Forgive</hi> we are much pleaſed with, and think you have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed well on that Head.</p>
               <p n="9">9. You are a very good Girl for ſending me a Copy of Miſs <hi>Darnford</hi>'s Letter. She is a charming young Lady. I always had a great Opinion of her Merit; her Letter abundantly confirms me in it. I hope you'll communicate to me every Letter that paſſes between you; and pray ſend me in your next a Copy of your Anſwer to her Letter: I muſt inſiſt upon it, I think.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I am glad with all my Heart to hear of poor <hi>Jewkes</hi>'s Reformation. Your Example carries all before it. But pray oblige me with your Anſwer to her Letter. Don't think me unreaſonable: 'Tis all for your ſake. You muſt needs know that, or you know nothing. For I think you deſerve all Miſs <hi>Darnford</hi> ſays of you; and that's a great deal too.</p>
               <p>Pray—have you ſhewn <hi>Jewkes</hi>'s Letter to your good Friend? — Lady <hi>Betty</hi> wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s to know (if you <hi>have</hi>) what he could ſay to it? for, ſhe ſays, it cuts him to the Quick; and I think ſo too, if he takes it as he ought: But, as you ſay, he's above loving Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue for <hi>Virtue's ſake,</hi> I warrant him. He likes it in a Wife, becauſe 'tis a Husband's Security againſt the <hi>Lex Talionis.</hi> There's a great deal in that, I can tell you. I once heard the Wretch hold an Argument, that Women had no Souls. I asked him, If he was to marry, whether he'd have his Wife <hi>act</hi> as if ſhe believ'd this Doctrine to be good? That was another thing he ſaid: He was for having his Wife think ſhe had, he muſt own: Such a Belief could do her no Harm. Ah! <hi>Pamela,</hi> Theory and Practice, never was ſuch a Rake, for one not quite a Town De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchee!</p>
               <p n="11">11. Your Manner of Acting by Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> with ſo handſome a Regard to my Brother's Intereſt, her
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0272600703:109"/>
Behaviour upon it, and your Relation of the Whole, and of his generous Spirit in approving, reproving, and improving your prudent Generoſity, make no inconſiderable Figure in your Papers. And Lady <hi>Betty</hi> ſays, Hang him, he has ſome excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities too!—It is impoſſible not to think well of him; and his good Actions go a great way towards atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his bad. But you, <hi>Pamela,</hi> have the Glory of all! We deſire particularly, that you will never omit any of thoſe moving Scenes, which you ſo well deſcribe, be the Occaſion what it will: For they are Nature, and that's your Excellence. Keep to that; for one more learned, I verily think, could not write as you do, nor inſtruct, and delight, and <hi>move,</hi> all at once, ſo very ingagingly.</p>
               <p n="12">12. I am glad you are learning <hi>French:</hi> Thou art a happy Girl in thy Teacher, and he is a happy Man in his Scholar. We are pleaſed with the pretty Account you give us of his Method of Inſtructing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding. 'Twould be ſtrange, if you did not learn any Language quickly under ſuch Methods, and with ſuch Encouragements, from the Man you love, were your Genius leſs apt than it is. But we wiſh'd you had inlarged on that Subject: For ſuch Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men to their Wives, who have been any time marry'd, is ſo rare and ſo unexpected from my Brother, that we thought you ſhould have written a Side upon that Subject at leaſt.</p>
               <p>What a bewitching Girl art thou! What an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar to Wives now, as well as thou waſt before to Maidens! Thou canſt tame Lions, I dare ſay, if thou'dſt try!—Reclaim a Rake in the Meridian of his Libertiniſm, and make ſuch an one as my Brother not only marry thee, but love thee better at ſeveral Months End, than he did the firſt Day, if poſſible! Wonderful Girl! Yet uſeſt thou no Arts but honeſt ones, ſuch as Prudence directs, Nature points out,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0272600703:110"/>
and ſuch as make Duty delightful, even command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt, when thou ſeemeſt moſt to ſubmit.</p>
               <p>It muſt be owned indeed, that thou haſt no brutal Mind to deal with: Bad as he is, it muſt be ſaid, that thou haſt a ſenſible and a generous Heart to work upon; one who takes no Glory in the blind Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Slave; but, like a true <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monarch, delights to reign in a free, rather than in an abject Mind. Yet is he jealous as a Tyrant of his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative: But you have found the way to lay that watchful Dragon aſleep, and ſo poſſeſs the golden Fruits of Content and true Pleaſure, the due Reward of your matchleſs Conduct.</p>
               <p>Now, my dear <hi>Pamela,</hi> I think I have taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the moſt material Articles in your Letters, and have no more to ſay to you; but, Write on, and oblige us; and mind to ſend me the Copy of your Letter to Miſs <hi>Darnford,</hi> of that you wrote to poor penitent <hi>Jewkes,</hi> and every Article I have written about, and all that comes into your Head, or that paſſes, and you'll oblige</p>

               <p>Your Ladyſhip is pleaſed to ſay, that People in upper Life love to ſee how plain Nature operates in honeſt Minds, who have hardly any thing elſe for their Guide; and if I might not be thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend too low for your Ladyſhip's Attention, (for as to myſelf, I ſhall, I hope, always look back with Pleaſure to what I <hi>was,</hi> in order to increaſe my Thankfulneſs for what I <hi>am</hi>) I would give you a Scene of Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and contented Poverty, of which otherwiſe your Ladyſhip can hardly have a Notion.

               <p>It was upon Occaſion of a great Loſs and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment which happened to my dear Parents (for tho' they were never high in Life, yet were they not always ſo low as my honoured Lady found them, when ſhe took me): My poor Father came home; and as the Loſs was of ſuch a Nature, as that he could not keep it from my Mother, he took her Hand, I remember well, and ſaid, after he had acquainted her with it,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Come, my Dear, let us take Comfort, that we did for the beſt. We left the Iſſue to Providence, as we ought, and that has turned it as it pleaſed; and we muſt be content, tho' not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured as we wiſhed. All the Buſineſs is, our Lot is not caſt for this Life. Let us reſign ourſelves to the Divine Will, and continue to do our Duty, and this ſhort Life will ſoon be paſt. Our

               </p>
               <p>Then my dear Mother threw her kind Arms about his Neck, and ſaid with Tears,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"God's Will be done, my dear Love!—All cannot be rich and happy. I am contented; and had rather ſay, I have a poor honeſt Husband, than a guilty rich one. What ſignifies repining? Let the World go as it will, we ſhall have our Length and our Breadth at laſt. And Providence, I make no Doubt, will be a better Friend to our good Girl here, becauſe ſhe is good, than we could be, if this had not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,"</q>—pointing to me, who, then about Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years old, (for it was before my Lady took me) ſat weeping in the Chimney Corner, over a few dying Embers of a Fire, at their moving Expreſſions.</p>
               <p>I aroſe, and kiſſing both their Hands, and bleſſing them, ſaid,

And we have had ſweet Sleep, and Dreams ſo pleaſant, that we have reaped greater Pleaſures, in repeating them to one another, at our next Leiſure-Hour, than, poſſibly, we ſhould have received, had we injoy'd the Comforts we wanted.</p>

                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0272600703:124"/>And, truly, my Lady, I muſt needs ſay, that while the virtuous Poor can be bleſs'd with ſuch ſweet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments as theſe, in contented Minds all Day, and in Dreams and Viſions at Night, I don't know whether they have not more, even of <hi>this</hi> World's Pleaſures, than the abounding Rich: And while the Hours of Night bear ſo near a Proportion to thoſe of the Day, may not ſuch be ſaid, even at the worſt, to paſs at leaſt half their Lives with more Comfort than many times the diſtemper'd Great can pretend to know?</p>
               <p>For a further Inſtance, that honeſt Poverty is not ſuch a deplorable State, let me ask, What Pleaſure can thoſe over-happy People taſte, who never knew that of Hunger or Thirſt? Like the Eaſtern Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch I have read of, who marching at the Head of a vaſt Army, thro' a deſert Place, where was no Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor any thing to quench his craving Thirſt, at laſt one of his Soldiers bringing him in his naſty Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met a little dirty Water, he greedily ſwallowed it, and cry'd out, That he never in all his Life had taſted ſo ſweet a Draught! Having always before eaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was hungry, and drank before he was thirſty.</p>
               <p>But when I talk or write of my dear worthy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, how I run on!—Excuſe me, my good Lady; and don't think me, in this reſpect, too much like the Cat in the <note n="*" place="bottom">See the New <hi>Aeſop's Fables,</hi> ſold by <hi>J.

               <p>What makes one, my dear Lady, in our moſt proſperous Condition, be always intermingling one's Fears and one's Anxieties of what <hi>may be;</hi> and by that Means rob one's ſelf of the Prime of one's beſt worldly Injoyments? — Is this Apprehenſiveneſs, does your Ladyſhip think, implanted in our Natures (for I know I am not vapouriſh, nor the only Perſon who is thus conſtituted) for wiſe and good Ends, that we may not think ourſelves ſo happy here, as to make us forget, that there is a better and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy State, which we ought to aſpire after? I believe it is: And if ſo, what an uſeful Monitor do we carry about us, that ſhall make us conſider and reflect, when in Proſperity; and in Adverſity teach us to bear up to Hopes of a happier Lot! Thus is it prettily ſaid by a Tranſlator of one of <hi>Horace</hi>'s Odes,

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0272600703:126"/>I now come to your Ladyſhip's fourth Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>And highly delighted I am for having obtained your Approbation of my Conduct to the Child, as well as of my Behaviour to the dear Gentleman on the unhappy Lady's Score. Your Ladyſhip's wiſe Intimations about having the Child with me, make due Impreſſion upon me; and I ſee in them, with grateful Pleaſure, your kind and unmerited Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for me. Yet I don't know how it is, but I have conceived a ſtrange Paſſion for this dear Baby: I cannot but look upon her poor Mamma as my Siſter in point of Trial: And ſhall not the proſperous Siſter pity and love the poor dear Siſter, that, in ſo ſlippery a Path, has <hi>fallen,</hi> while <hi>ſhe</hi> had the Happineſs to keep her Feet?</p>
               <p>No doubt, Miſs <hi>Godfrey</hi> loved Virtue, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it to all Conſiderations: 'Tis plain ſhe did even after her Fall — when, as I have obſerved in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers <note n="*" place="bottom">

I know not who could have acted up to this Part of her Character.</p>
               <p>The reſt of your Ladyſhip's Articles give me the greateſt Pleaſure and Satisfaction; and if I can but continue myſelf in the Favour of your dear Brother, and improve in that of his noble Siſter, how happy ſhall I be! I will do all I can to deſerve both. And I hope your Ladyſhip will take as an Inſtance that I would, the chearful Obedience which I pay to your

Commands, in writing to ſo fine a Judge, ſuch crude and indigeſted Stuff, as otherwiſe I ought to be aſhamed to lay before you.</p>
               <p>I am impatient for the Honour, which your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip makes me hope for, of your Preſence here: And yet I perplex myſelf with the Fear of appearing ſo unworthy in your Eyes, when near you, as to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in your Opinion; but I promiſe myſelf, that however this may be the Caſe on your <hi>firſt</hi> Viſit, I ſhall be ſo much improved by the Benefits I ſhall reap from your Leſſons and good Example, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall be favoured with a <hi>Second,</hi> you ſhall have leſs Faults to find with me; till, as I ſhall be more and more favoured, I ſhall in time be juſt what your Ladyſhip will wiſh me to be, and of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence more worthy than I am of the Honour of ſtyling myſelf,</p>

                     <hi>My dear Mrs.</hi> B.</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU are highly obliging to me in expreſſing ſo warmly your Wiſhes to have me with you. I know not any body in this World, out of our own Family, in whoſe Company I ſhould be happier: But my Papa won't part with me, I think; tho' I had ſecur'd my Mamma in my Intereſt; and I know <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> would be glad of my Abſence, becauſe the dear perverſly Envious thinks <hi>me</hi> more valued than <hi>ſhe</hi> is; and yet, fooliſh Girl, ſhe don't conſider, that if her Envy be well-grounded, I ſhould return with more than double Advantages to what I now have, improv'd by your charming Example and Converſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0272600703:128"/>My Papa affects to be in a fearful Pet at your lecturing of him ſo juſtly; for my Mamma would ſhew it him; and he ſays he will poſitively demand Satisfaction of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> for your treating him ſo freely. And yet he ſhall hardly think him, he ſays, on a Rank with him, unleſs Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will, on Occaſion of the new Commiſſion, take out his <hi>Dedimus:</hi> And then if he will bring you down to <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and join with him to commit you Priſoner for a Month at the Hall, all ſhall be well.</p>
               <p>It is very obliging in Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to join in your kind Invitation: But—yet I am loth to ſay it to you—But the Character of your worthy Gentleman, I doubt, ſtands a little in the Way with my Papa: For he will have it, that he is juſt ſuch a Rake as is to be liked by a Lady; one that ſaves common Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and that's all; and is too handſome, too witty, and too enterprizing, for any <hi>honeſt Man,</hi> that's Si <hi>Simon</hi>'s Phraſe, <hi>to truſt his Daughter with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Mamma pleaded his being marry'd. — Ads<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, Madam, ſaid he, what of all that! What married Man, when a pretty Girl's in the Way, minds his Wife, except ſhe has made him ſtand in Fear of her? and that's far from the Caſe here. Why I tell you, added his peeviſh Highneſs, if our <hi>Polly</hi> ſhould happen to ſlip, (I thank him for his Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition) he'd make his Lady nurſe both <hi>her</hi> and the <hi>Baſtard,</hi> (another of his polite Expreſſions) if he had a mind to it, and ſhe durſt not refuſe him. And would you truſt ſuch a ſpritely Girl as <hi>Polly,</hi> in the Houſe with ſuch a Fellow as that?</p>
               <p>Theſe, it ſeems, were his Words and Reaſonings: I thank him for his Opinion of his Daughter. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not me to ſay, by what Rules my Papa judges of Mankind; Rules, however, that are not much to the Credit of his Sex: — But it made me put on very grave Airs when I came to Supper, (for after
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0272600703:129"/>
this Repulſe, and the Reaſons given for it, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Indiſpoſition, not to dine with my Papa, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half-vex'd, and half-afraid of his Raillery) and he ſaid, Why, how now, <hi>Polly!</hi> What! in the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens, Girl? I ſaid, I ſhould have hoped, that I never gave my Papa Cauſe to ſuſpect my Conduct, and that he would have had a better Opinion of the Force which the Example and Precepts of my good Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma had upon me.</p>
               <p>Not your <hi>Papa</hi>'s Example then. — Very well, Saucebox: I underſtand you.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, ſaid I, I hope, if I may not go to <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> you'll permit me to go to <hi>London</hi> when Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> goes.</p>
               <p>No, ſaid he, poſitively no!</p>
               <p>Well, Sir, I have done. I could hope, however, you would inable me to give a better Reaſon to good Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> why I am not permitted to accept of her kind Invitation, than that which I underſtand you have been pleaſed to aſſign.</p>
               <p>He ſtuck his Hands in his Sides, with his uſual hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous Poſitiveneſs, Why then tell her, ſhe is a very ſaucy Lady, for her laſt Letter to you; and that her Lord and Maſter is not to be truſted; and it is my abſolute Will and Pleaſure, that you ask me no more Queſtions about it.</p>
               <p>I will very faithfully make this Report, Sir. Do ſo. — And ſo I have. — And your poor <hi>Polly Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> is diſappointed of one of the greateſt Pleaſures ſhe could have had.</p>
               <p>I can't help it. — And if you truly pity me, I can put you in a Way to make me eaſier under the Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, than otherwiſe I can poſſibly be; and that is, to favour me with an Epiſtolary Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince I am deny'd a Perſonal one; and this my Mamma joins to requeſt of you; and particularly, to let us know how Lady <hi>Davers</hi>'s firſt Viſit paſſes;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0272600703:130"/>
which Mrs. <hi>Peters</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Jones,</hi> who know my Lady ſo well, likewiſe long to hear: And this will make us the beſt Amends in your Power for the Loſs of your good Neighbourhood, which we had all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to ourſelves.</p>
               <p>This Denial of my Papa comes out, ſince I wrote the above, to be principally owing to a Propoſal made him of an humble Servant to one of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: He won't ſay which, he tells us, in his uſual humourous Way, leſt we ſhould fall out about it.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe, I tell him, the young Gentleman is to pick and chuſe which of the two he likes beſt. But be he a Duke, 'tis all one to <hi>Polly,</hi> if he is not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above our common <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> Claſs of Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hunters.</p>
               <p>I have ſhewn Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Peters</hi> your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They admire you beyond Expreſſion; and Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> ſays, He does not know that ever he did any thing in all his Life, that ever gave him ſo much inward Reproach, as his denying you the Protection of his Family, which Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 175.</note> ſought to move him to afford you, when you were confined at the Hall, before Mr. <hi>B.</hi> came down to you, with his Heart bent on Miſchief; and all he comforts himſelf with is, that that very Denial, as well as the other Hardſhips you met with, were neceſſary to bring about that Work of Providence which was to reward your unexampled Virtue.</p>
               <p>Yet, he ſays, he doubts he ſhall not be thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable by you, who are ſo exact in your own Duty, as he had the Unhappineſs to loſe ſuch an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to have done Honour to his Function, had he had the Fortitude to have done <hi>his</hi>; and he begg'd of me, ſome how or other, and at ſome time or other, to hint his Concern to you on this Head; and to hope,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0272600703:131"/>
in his Name, that neither Religion nor his Cloth may ſuffer in your Opinion, for the Fault of one of its Profeſſors, who never was wanting in his Duty ſo much before.</p>
               <p>He had it often upon his Mind, he ſays, to write to you on this very Subject; but he had not the Courage; and beſides, did not know how Mr. <hi>B.</hi> might take it, if he ſhould ſee that Letter, as the Caſe had ſuch delicate Circumſtances in it, that in blaming himſelf, as he ſhould very freely have done, he muſt, by Implication, have caſt ſtill greater Blame upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> is certainly a very good Man, and my Favourite for that Reaſon; and I hope <hi>you,</hi> that could ſo eaſily forgive the late wicked, but now peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Jewkes,</hi> will overlook with Kindneſs a Fault in a good Man, that proceeded more from Puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity and Conſtitution, than from Want of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: And once, talking of it to my Mamma and me, he accuſed himſelf on this ſcore, to her, with Tears in his Eyes. She, good Lady, would have given you this Protection, at Mr. <hi>William</hi>'s Deſire; but wanted the <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 174.</note> Power to do it.</p>
               <p>So you ſee, my dear Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> how your Virtue has ſhamed every one into ſuch a Senſe of what they ought to have done, that Good, Bad and Indifferent are ſeeking to make Excuſes for paſt Misbehaviour, and to promiſe future Amendment, like penitent Subjects returning to their Duty to their conquering Sovereign, after ſome unworthy Defection.</p>
               <p>Happy, happy Lady! may you be ever ſo! May you always convert your Enemies, confirm the Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, and every Day multiply your Friends, prays,</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>LITTLE did I think I ſhould ever have Occaſion to make a formal Complaint againſt a Perſon very dear to you, and who I believe deſerves to be ſo; but don't let them be ſo proud and ſo vain of oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pleaſing you, as to make them not care how they affront every body elſe.</p>
               <p>The Perſon is no other than the Wife of your Boſom, who has taken ſuch Liberties with me as ought not to be taken, and ſought to turn my own Child againſt me, and make a dutiful Girl a Rebel.</p>
               <p>If People will ſet up for Virtue, and all that, let 'em be uniformly virtuous, or I would not give a Farthing for their Pretences to it.</p>
               <p>Here I have been plagued with Gouts, Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms, and nameleſs Diſorders, ever ſince you left us, which have made me call for a little more Attendance than ordinary; and I had Reaſon to think myſelf ſlighted, where an indulgent Father can leaſt bear to be ſlighted, that is, where he moſt loves; and that by young Upſtarts, who are growing up to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of thoſe Pleaſures which have run away from me, fleeting Raſcals as they are! before I was willing to part with them. And I rung and rung, and,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0272600703:133"/>
Where's <hi>Polly?</hi> (for I honour the Slut with too much of my Notice) Where's <hi>Polly?</hi> was all my Cry, to every one who came up to ask what I rung for. And at laſt in burſt the pert Slut, with an Air of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, as if ſhe thought all muſt be well the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe appeared, with, Do you want me, Papa?</p>
               <p>Do I want you, Confidence! Yes, I do. Where have you been theſe two Hours, and never came near me, when you knew 'twas my Time to have my Foot rubbed, which gives me mortal Pain? For you muſt underſtand, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that nobody's Hand's ſo ſoft as <hi>Polly's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She gave me a ſaucy Anſwer, as I was diſpoſed to think it, becauſe I had juſt then a Twinge, that I could ſcarce bear; for Pain is a plaguy thing to a Man of my lively Spirits. Why, with a P—x to it, cannot it go and rouſe up ſome ſtupid lethargic Raſcal, whoſe Blood is ready to ſtagnate? There it might do ſome Good; and not make an honeſt Man miſerable, as it does me, who want none of its pungent Helps to Feeling.</p>
               <p>She gave me, I ſay, a pert Anſwer, and turn'd upon her Heel; and not coming near me at my firſt Word, I flung a Book I had in my Hand at her Head.</p>
               <p>This the ſaucy Slut (Girls now-a-days make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of expoſing their indulgent Parents) has men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in a Letter to your Lady; and ſhe has abuſed me upon it in <hi>ſuch</hi> a Manner— Well, if you don't take ſome Courſe with her, I muſt with you, that's poſitive; and young as you are, and a Cripple as I am, I'll ſtump to an appoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed Place, to procure to myſelf the Satisfaction of a Man of Honour.</p>
               <p>Your Lady has written to <hi>Polly</hi> what <hi>ſhe</hi> would have ſaid to me on this Occaſion. She has reflected upon me for not reading a Book of Mortification, when I was labouring under ſo great a Senſe of it,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0272600703:134"/>
and confin'd to my Elbow-Chair in one Room, whom lately half a Dozen Counties could hardly contain: She has put it into <hi>Polly</hi>'s Head to fling this very Book at her Siſter's Head, in Imitation of my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and hopes <hi>Nancy</hi> will fling it at ſomebody's elſe, till it goes all round the Houſe: She reproaches me for making no better Uſe of a <hi>good</hi> Book, as ſhe calls <hi>Rabelais</hi>'s <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> which I innocently was reading to make me the more chearfully bear my Misfortune; and runs on a Pack of Stuff about my <hi>Polly</hi>'s Eyes, and Skin, and I don't know what, on Purpoſe to fill the Girl with Notions that don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to her, in order to make her proud and ſaucy; and then to inſpire her with Inſolence to me, runs on with Suppoſitions of what Harm I might have done her, had the Book bruiſed her Face, or Eyes, and ſo forth: As if our Daughters Eyes were not our own Eyes, their brazen Faces our brazen Faces; at leaſt till we can find ſomebody to take them, and all the reſt of their Trumpery, off of our Hands. — Saucy Baggages! who have neither Souls nor Senſes, but what they have borrowed from us; and whoſe very Bones, and the Skin that covers them, ſo much their Pride and their Ornament, are ſo many Parts of our own undervalued Skin and Bones; and ours only are more wrinkled, by taking Pains to make theirs ſmooth.</p>
               <p>Nay, this fine Lady of yours, this Paragon of Meekneſs and Humility, in ſo many Words, bids me, or tells my own Daughter to bid me, which is worſe, never to take a Book in my Hands again, if I won't make a better Uſe of it: —And yet, what better Uſe can an offended Father make of the beſt Books, than to correct a rebellious Child with them, and oblige a ſaucy Daughter to jump into her Duty all at once?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0272600703:135"/>Then, pray, Sir, do you allow your Lady to beg Preſents from Gentlemen? — This is a tender Point to touch upon: But you ſhall know all, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd.—For here ſhe ſends to deſire me to make her a Preſent of this very Book, and promiſes to ſend me another as good.</p>
               <p>Come, come, Sir, theſe are no jeſting Matters; for, is it not a ſad thing to think, that Ladies, let them be young or old, well-marry'd or ill-marry'd, cannot live without Intrigue? And here, if I were not a very honeſt Man, and your Friend, and <hi>reſolv'd</hi> to be a virtuous Man too, in ſpite of Temptation, one does not know what might be the Conſequence of ſuch a Correſpondence as is here begun, or rather <hi>deſired</hi> to be begun; for I have too much <hi>Honour</hi> to give into it, for your ſake, and I hope you'll think yourſelf much oblig'd to me. — I know the Time that I have improv'd a more myſterious Hint than this, into all that I had a Mind to make of it. And it may be very happy for you, Neighbour, that I <hi>muſt</hi> and <hi>will</hi> be virtuous, let the Temptation be from whom it will: For the fineſt Lady in the World is nothing to me now — in this my Reformed State.</p>
               <p>But this is not all: Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> goes on to reflect upon me for making her bluſh formerly, and ſaying Things before my Daughters, that, truly, I ought to be aſhamed to ſay; and then avows Malice and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and all that. Why, Sir, why, Neighbour, are theſe Things to be borne? — Do you allow your Lady to ſet up for a general Corrector of every body's Morals but your own? Do you allow her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the only Inſtances of Wit that remain to this Generation, that dear polite <hi>Double Entendre</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which keeps alive the Attention, and quickens the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the beſt Companies in the World, and is the Salt, the Sauce, which gives a Poignancy to all our genteeler Entertainments?</p>
               <p>

Let her firſt find People that can ſupport a Converſation with Wit and good Senſe like her own, and then ſomething might be ſaid: But, till then, I poſitively ſay, and will ſwear upon Occaſion, that <hi>Double En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendre</hi> ſhall not be baniſhed from our Tables; and where this won't raiſe a Bluſh, or create a Laugh, we will be at Liberty, if we pleaſe, for all Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> and her new-fangled Notions, to force the one and the other by ſtill plainer Hints, and let her help her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf how ſhe can.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, you find my Complaints are of a high Nature, regarding the Quiet of a Family, the Duty of a Child to a Parent, the Advances of a married Lady to a Gentleman who is reſolv'd to be virtuous, and the Freedom of Converſation; in all which Points your Lady has greatly offended; and I inſiſt upon Satisfaction from you, or ſuch a Correction of the fair Tranſgreſſor, as is in your Power to inflict, and which may prevent worſe Conſequences, from</p>

               <head>LETTER XXIII. From Mr. <hi>B.</hi> In Anſwer to the preceding.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>
                     <hi>Dear Sir</hi> Simon,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU cannot but believe, that I was much ſurpriſed at your Letter, complaining of the Behaviour of my Wife. I could no more have expected ſuch a Complaint from ſuch a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0272600703:137"/>
Gentleman, than I could, that <hi>ſhe</hi> would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it: And I am very ſorry on <hi>both</hi> Accounts. I have talked to her in ſuch a Manner, that, I dare ſay, ſhe will never give you like Cauſe to appeal to me.</p>
               <p>It happened, that the Criminal herſelf received your Letter from her Servant, and brought it to me in my Cloſet, and, making her Honours, (for I can't ſay but ſhe is very obliging to me, tho' ſhe takes ſuch ſaucy Freedoms with my Friends) away ſhe tripp'd; and I, inquiring for her, when, with Surprize, as you may believe, I had read your Charge, found ſhe was gone to viſit a poor ſick Neighbour, of which indeed ſhe had before appris'd me, becauſe ſhe took the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot; but I had forgot it in my Wrath.</p>
               <p>'Twas well for her, that ſhe was not in the Way; perhaps I ſhould have taken more ſevere Methods with her in my firſt Emotions; and I long'd for her Return: And there is another <hi>Well-for-her</hi> too in her Caſe; for one would be loth to ſpoil a Son and Heir, you know, Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> before we ſee whether the little Varlet may deſerve one's Conſideration.</p>
               <p>I mention theſe Things, that you may obſerve, it was not owing to any Regard for the Offender her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that I did not puniſh her as much as injur'd Friendſhip requir'd at my Hands.</p>
               <p>At laſt, in ſhe came, with that ſweet Compoſure in her Face which reſults from a Conſciouſneſs of doing <hi>generally</hi> juſt and generous Things; altho' in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhe has ſo egregiouſly err'd, that it behoves me (as well in Juſtice to my Friend, as Policy to myſelf; for who knows whither firſt Faults may lead, if not checked in time?) to nip ſuch Boldneſs in the Bud. And indeed the Moment I beheld the Charmer of my Heart, (for I do love her too well, that's certain) all my Anger was diſarm'd; and had the Offence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded <hi>myſelf,</hi> I muſt have forgiven her, in ſpite of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0272600703:138"/>
all my meditated Wrath. But it behov'd me in a <hi>Friend</hi>'s Caſe not to be ſoon ſubdu'd by a too partial Fondneſs: I reſumed therefore that Sternneſs and Diſpleaſure which her Entrance had almoſt diſſipated. I took her Hand: Her charming Eye (you know what an Eye ſhe has, Sir <hi>Simon</hi>) quivered at my over-clouded Aſpect, and her Lips, half-drawn to a Smile, trembled with Apprehenſion of a Countenance ſo changed from what ſhe left it.</p>
               <p>And then, all ſtiff and ſtately as I could look, did I accoſt her: Come along with me, <hi>Pamela,</hi> to my Cloſet. I want to talk with you.</p>
               <p>Dear Sir! good Sir! what's the Matter? what have I done?</p>
               <p>We entered. I ſat down, ſtill holding her unſteady Hand, and her Pulſe fluttering under my Finger, like a dying Bird.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>well,</hi> ſaid I, 'tis <hi>well,</hi> your preſent Condition pleads for you; and I muſt not carry what I have to ſay too far, for Conſiderations leſs in your Favour, than for one unſeen: But I have great Complaints againſt you.</p>
               <p>Againſt me, Sir! — What have I done? Let me know, dear good Sir! looking round, with her half-affrighted Eyes, this way and that, on the Books, and Pictures, and on me, by Turns.</p>
               <p>You ſhall know ſoon, ſaid I, the Crime you have been guilty of.</p>
               <p>Pray let me, Sir! — This Cloſet, I hoped, would not be a <hi>ſecond</hi> Time Witneſs to the Flutter you put me in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There</hi> hangs a Tale, Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> that I am not very fond of relating, ſince it gave Beginning to the Triumphs of this <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 102.</note> little Sorcereſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0272600703:139"/>I ſtill held one Hand, and ſhe ſtood before me, as Criminals ought to do before their Judge; but ſaid, I ſee, Sir, ſure I do, or what will elſe become of me! leſs Severity in your Eyes than you affect to put on in your Countenance. Dear Sir, let me know my Fault! I will repent, acknowlege and amend: Let me <hi>but</hi> know it.</p>
               <p>You muſt have great Preſence of Mind, <hi>Pamela,</hi> reply'd I, ſuch is the Nature of your Fault, if you can look me in the Face, when I tell it you.</p>
               <p>Then let me, ſaid the irreſiſtible Charmer, hiding her Face in my Boſom, and putting her other Arm about my Neck; let me thus, my Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hide this guilty Face, while I hear my Fault told; and I will not ſeek to extenuate it, but by my Tears, and my Penitence.</p>
               <p>I could hardly hold out. What infatuating Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are theſe Women, when they can think it thus worth their while to ſooth and calm the Tumults of an angry Heart! When, inſtead of <hi>ſcornful</hi> Looks darted in Return for <hi>angry</hi> ones, Words of <hi>Defiance</hi> for Words of <hi>Peeviſhneſs,</hi> perſiſting to defend <hi>one</hi> Error by <hi>another,</hi> and returning <hi>vehement Wrath</hi> for <hi>ſlight Indignation,</hi> and all the hoſtile Provocations of the Marriage Warfare; they can thus hide their dear Faces in our Boſoms, and wiſh but to <hi>know</hi> their Faults, to <hi>amend</hi> them!</p>
               <p>I could hardly, I ſay, reſiſt the ſweet Girl's Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; nay, I believe I did, unawares to myſelf, and in Defiance of my reſolv'd Diſpleaſure, preſs her Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with my Lips, as the reſt of her Face was hid on my Breaſt: But, conſidering it was the Cauſe of my <hi>Friend</hi> that I was to aſſert, my <hi>injured</hi> Friend, wounded and inſulted, in ſo various a Manner, by the fair Offender, thus haughtily ſpoke I to the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Miſchief, in a Pomp of Style theatrically tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0272600703:140"/>I will not, too inadvertent and undiſtinguiſhing <hi>Pamela,</hi> keep you long in Suſpenſe, for the ſake of a Circumſtance, that, on this Occaſion, ought to give you as much Joy, as it has, till now, given me— Since it becomes an Advocate in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, when otherwiſe you might expect a very ſevere Treatment. Know then, that the Letter you gave me before you went out, is a Letter from a Friend, a Neighbour, a worthy Neighbour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of your Behaviour to him; — no other than Sir <hi>Simon Darnford,</hi> (for I would not amuſe her too much) a Gentleman I muſt always reſpect, and whom, as <hi>my</hi> Friend, I expected <hi>you</hi> ſhould: Since by the Value a Wife expreſſes for one eſteemed by her Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>band, whether ſhe thinks ſo well of him herſelf, or not, a Man ought always to judge of the Sincerity of her Regards to himſelf.</p>
               <p>She raiſed her Head at once on this: Thank Heav'n! ſaid ſhe, it is no worſe!—I was at my Wits End almoſt, in Apprehenſion: But I know how this muſt be.—Dear Sir, How could you frighten me ſo.—I know how all this is!—I can now look you in the Face, and hear all that Sir <hi>Simon</hi> can charge me with: For I am ſure, I have not ſo affronted him, as to make him angry indeed. And truly, (ran ſhe on, ſecure of Pardon, as ſhe ſeem'd to think) I ſhould reſpect Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> not only as your Friend, but on his own Account, if he was not ſo ſad a Rake at a Time of Life—</p>
               <p>Then I interrupted her, you muſt needs think, Sir <hi>Simon</hi>; for how could I bear to hear my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friend ſo freely treated?—How now, <hi>Pamela!</hi> ſaid I; and is it thus, by <hi>repeating</hi> your Fault, that you <hi>atone</hi> for it? Do you think I can bear to hear my Friend ſo freely treated?</p>
               <p>Indeed, ſaid ſhe, I do reſpect Sir <hi>Simon</hi> very much, as your <hi>Friend,</hi> permit me to repeat; but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0272600703:141"/>
cannot for his wilful Failings. Would it not be, in ſome meaſure, to approve of faulty Converſation, if one can hear it, and not diſcourage it, when the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion comes in ſo pat? —And, indeed, I was glad of an Opportunity, continued ſhe, to give him a little Rub; I muſt needs own it: But if it diſpleaſes you, or has made him angry in Earneſt, I am ſorry for it, and will be leſs bold for the future.</p>
               <p>Read then, ſaid I, the heavy Charge, and I'll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn inſtantly to hear your Anſwer to it. So I went from her, for a few Minutes.</p>
               <p>But, would you believe it, Sir <hi>Simon?</hi> ſhe ſeem'd, on my Return, very little concerned at your juſt Complaints.—What ſelf-juſtifying Minds have the meekeſt of theſe Women!—Inſtead of finding her in repentant Tears, as one might have expected, ſhe took your angry Letter for a jocular one, and I had great Difficulty to convince her of the Heinouſneſs of <hi>her</hi> Fault, or the Reality of <hi>your</hi> Anger. Upon which, being determin'd to have Juſtice done to my Friend, and a due Senſe of her own great Error im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd upon her, I began thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pamela, Pamela,</hi> take heed, that you do not ſuffer the Purity of your own Mind, in Breach of your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to make you too rigorous a Cenſurer of other Peoples Actions: Don't be ſo puff'd up with your own Perfections, as to imagine, that, becauſe other Perſons allow themſelves Liberties you cannot take, <hi>therefore</hi> they muſt be wicked. Sir <hi>Simon</hi> is a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who indulges himſelf in a pleaſant Vein, and, I believe, as well as you, <hi>has been</hi> a great Rake and Libertine (you'll excuſe me, Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> becauſe I am taking your Part): But what then? You ſee it is all over with him now: You ſee, he ſays himſelf, that he <hi>muſt,</hi> and therefore he <hi>will,</hi> be virtuous: And is a Man for ever to hear of the Faults of his Youth, when he himſelf is ſo willing to forget them?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0272600703:142"/>Ah! but, Sir, Sir, ſaid the bold Slut, can you ſay he is <hi>willing</hi> to forget them?—Does he not repine here in this very Letter, that he <hi>muſt</hi> forſake them; and does he not plainly cheriſh the <hi>Inclination,</hi> when he owns—She heſitated—Owns what?—You know what I mean, Sir; and I need not ſpeak it: And can there well be a more cenſurable Character?—Then, dear Sir, <hi>before</hi> his Maiden Daughters! <hi>before</hi> his virtuous Lady! <hi>before</hi> Any-body!—What a ſad thing is this, at a Time of Life, which ſhould afford a better Example!</p>
               <p>But, dear Sir, continu'd the bold Prattler, (taking Advantage of a Silence that was more owing to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure than Approbation) let me, for I would not be <hi>cenſorious,</hi> (No, not ſhe! In the very Act of Cenſoriouſneſs to ſay this! let me) offer but one thing: Don't you think, Sir <hi>Simon</hi> himſelf would be loth to be thought a reform'd Gentleman? Don't you ſee the Delight he takes, when he ſpeaks of his former Pranks, as if he was ſorry he could not play them over again? See but how he ſimpers, and <hi>injoys,</hi> as one may ſay, the Relations of his own rakiſh Actions, when he tells a bad Story!—And have you not ſeen how often he has been forced to take his Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to wipe the Outſide of his Mouth, tho' the Inſide wanted it moſt, when he has wounded a Lady's Ears, and turn'd, as it were, his own faulty Heart inſide out?—Indeed, Sir, I am afraid, ſo bad in this way is your worthy Neighbour, that he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a Diſgrace to him to be thought reform'd: And how then can I abuſe the Gentleman, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him in a Light in which he loves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered?</p>
               <p>But, ſaid I, were this the Caſe, (for I profeſs, Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> I was at a grievous Loſs to defend you) for you to write all theſe free things againſt a Father to his Daughter, is that right, <hi>Pamela?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0272600703:143"/>O Sir! the <hi>good</hi> Gentleman himſelf has taken care, that ſuch a Character as I preſum'd to draw to Miſs of her Papa, was no ſtrange one to her. You have ſeen yourſelf, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> whenever his arch Leers, and the humourous Attitude in which he puts himſelf on thoſe Occaſions, have taught us to expect ſome ſhocking Story, how his Lady and Daughters (us'd to him, as they are) have ſuffer'd in their Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of what he would ſay, before he ſpoke it: How, particularly, dear Miſs <hi>Darnford</hi> has look'd at me with Concern, deſirous, as it were, if poſſible, to ſave her Papa from the Cenſure, which his faulty Expreſſions muſt naturally bring upon him. And, dear Sir, is it not a ſad thing for a young Lady, who loves and honours her Papa, to obſerve that he is diſcrediting himſelf, and <hi>wants</hi> the Example he ought to <hi>give?</hi> And, pardon me, Sir, for ſmiling on ſo ſerious an Occaſion, continu'd ſhe; but is it not a fine Sight, do you think, to ſee a Gentleman, as we have more than once ſeen Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> when he has thought proper to read a Paſſage or ſo, in ſome bad Book, pulling off <hi>his Spectacles,</hi> to talk filthily? Methinks, I ſee him now, added the bold Slut, ſplitting his arch Face, with a broad Laugh, ſhewing a Mouth, with hardly a Tooth in it, while he is making obſcene Remarks upon what he has read.—</p>
               <p>And then the dear Saucyface laugh'd out, to bear <hi>me</hi> Company; for I could not, for the Soul of me, avoid laughing heartily at the Figure ſhe brought to my Mind, which I have ſeen my old Friend make, on two or three Occaſions of this ſort, with his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted Spectacles, his arch Mouth, and Gums of ſhining Jet, ſucceeding thoſe of poliſh'd Ivory, of which he often boaſts, as one Ornament of his youthful Days.—And I the rather in my Heart, Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> gave you up, becauſe, when I was a ſad Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, it was always a Maxim with me, to endeavour
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0272600703:144"/>
to touch a Lady's Heart without wounding her Ears. And, indeed, I found my Account ſometimes in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it.</p>
               <p>But, reſuming my Gravity, Huſſy, ſaid I, do you think I will have my old Friend thus made the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your Ridicule?—Suppoſe a Challenge ſhould have enſu'd between us on your Account—What might have been the Iſſue of it? To ſee an old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, ſtumping, as he ſays, on Crutches, to fight a Duel in Defence of his wounded Honour! A pretty Sight this would have afforded, would it not? And what (had any one met him on the Way) could he have ſaid he was going to do? Don't you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that a Man is anſwerable for the Faults of his Wife? And, if my Fondneſs for you would have made me deny doing Juſtice to my Friend, and, on the contrary, to reſolve in your behalf to give him a Meeting, and he had flung his Crutch at my Head, as he did the Book at his Daughter's, what might have been the Conſequence, think you?</p>
               <p>Very bad, Sir, ſaid ſhe, to be ſure; I ſee that and am ſorry for it: For had you carry'd off Sir <hi>Simon</hi>'s Crutch as a Trophy, the poor Gentleman muſt have lain ſighing and groaning, like a wounded Soldier in the Field of Battle, till another had been brought him, to have ſtump'd home with.</p>
               <p>But, dear Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> I have brought this Matter to an Iſſue, that will, I hope, make all eaſy: And that is this—Miſs <hi>Polly,</hi> and my <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſhall both be puniſh'd as they deſerve, if it be not your own Fault. I am told, that the Sins of your Youth don't fit ſo heavily upon your Limbs, as they do in your Imagination; and I believe Change of Air, and the Gratification of your Revenge, a fine Help to ſuch lively Spirits as yours! will ſet you up. You ſhall then take Coach, and bring your pretty Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to mine; and when we have them together, they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0272600703:145"/>
ſhall humble themſelves before us, and it ſhall be in your Power to abſolve or puniſh them, as you ſhall ſee proper. For I cannot bear to have my worthy Friend inſulted in ſo heinous a manner by a couple of ſaucy Girls, who, if not taken down in time, may proceed from Fault to Fault, till there will be no Living with them.</p>
               <p>If (to be ſtill more ſerious) your Lady and you will lend Miſs <hi>Darnford</hi> to my <hi>Pamela</hi>'s Wiſhes, whoſe Heart is ſet upon the Hope of her wintering with us in Town, you will lay an Obligation upon us both; which will be acknowleged with great Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, by, Dear Sir,</p>

               <head>LETTER XXIV. From Sir <hi>SIMON DARNFORD,</hi> in Reply.</head>
               <p>HARK ye me, 'Squire <hi>B.</hi>—A Word in your Ear!—I like neither you, nor your Wife, to be plain with you, well enough to truſt my <hi>Polly</hi> with you. What! you are to ſhew her, in your Lady's Caſe, all the Game of a Lying-in, I ſuppoſe; and, at leaſt, ſet the Girl a longing to make one in the Dance, before I have found out the proper Man for her Partner!</p>
               <p>But here's War declar'd againſt my poor Gums, it ſeems. Well, I will never open my Mouth before your Lady, as long as I live, if I can help it. I have for theſe Ten Years avoided to put on my Cravat; and for what Reaſon, do you think?—Why, becauſe I could not bear to ſee what Ruins a few Years have made in a Viſage, that us'd to inſpire Love and Terror as it pleas'd.—And here your—What-ſhall-I-call-her of a Wife, with all the Inſolence of Youth
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0272600703:146"/>
and Beauty on her Side, follows me with a Glaſs, and would make me look in it, whether I will or not. I'm a plaguy good-humour'd old Fellow—if I <hi>am</hi> an old Fellow—or I ſhould not bear the Inſults con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in your Letter. Between you and your Lady, you make a wretched Figure of me, that's certain— And yet, 'tis <hi>taking my Part,</hi> with a P—x to <hi>you,</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I would have ſaid; but on your Lady's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count—You ſee I have as much more Charity than her, as ſhe has Purity than me; or I ſhould not have put in that Saving Clauſe in her Behalf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſmounted Spectacles, arch Mouth, Gums of ſhining Jet,</hi> and ſuch-like fine Deſcriptions, are theſe yours, or your Lady's? I'd be glad to know that, Mr. <hi>B.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Well but, What a D—l muſt a Man do?—I'd be glad at any Rate to ſtand in your Lady's Graces, that I would: Nor would I be the laſt Rake and Libertine unreform'd by her Example, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe will make Virtue the Faſhion, if ſhe goes on at the Rate ſhe does. But here I have been us'd to cut a Joke, and toſs the Squib about; and, as far as I know, it has help'd to keep me alive in the midſt of Pains and Aches, and with two Women-grown Girls, and the reſt of the Mortifications that will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on <hi>advanced Years</hi>; for I won't (hang me if I will) give it up as abſolute <hi>Old-age!</hi>—</p>
               <p>I love, I own it, to make a pretty Woman bluſh; it is double-damasking a fine Roſe, as it were; and till I ſaw your—[Do, let me call her ſome free Name or other! I always lov'd to be free with pretty Women! Till I ſaw your—Methinks I like her <hi>Arcadian</hi> Name, tho' I'm ſo old a Swain, as not to merit any thing but Rebuke at her Hands — Well then, till I ſaw your]— <hi>Pamela</hi> — I thought all Ladies, in their Hearts, lov'd a little Squib of that kind. For why ſhould they not, when it adds ſo
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0272600703:147"/>
much Grace to their Features, and improves their native Charms?—And often have I toſs'd the Joke about, as much, in my Intention, to oblige <hi>them</hi> as <hi>myſelf.</hi>—Yet no one can ſay, but that I always wrapt it up in clean Linen, as the Saying is—Only ſuiting myſelf to my Company, till I had made the dear Rogues <hi>ſenſible,</hi> and ſhew they could apprehend.</p>
               <p>But now, it ſeems, I muſt leave all this off, or I muſt be mortify'd with a Looking-glaſs held before me, and every Wrinkle muſt be made as conſpicuous as a Cable-rope.—And what, pray, is to ſucceed to this Reformation?—I can neither faſt nor pray, I doubt.—And beſides, if my Stomach and my Jeſt depart from me, farewel, Sir <hi>Simon Darnford!</hi>

               <p>But cannot I paſs as one neceſſary Character, do you think; as a Foil (as by-the-bye ſome of your own Actions have been to your Lady's Virtue) to ſet off ſome more edifying Example, where Variety of Characters make up a Feaſt in Converſation?</p>
               <p>I beſeech you, Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſtick me into ſome Poſy among your finer Flowers — And if you won't put me in your Boſom, let me ſtand in ſome gay Flower-pot in your Chimney Corner: I may ſerve for Shew, if not for Smell. Or, let me be the Baſs in your Muſick, or permit my humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humdrum to ſerve as a pardonable kind of Diſcord to ſet off your own Harmony.—I verily think, I cannot be ſo good as you'd have me to be: So pray let your poor <hi>Anacreon</hi> go off with what he loves. It will be very cruel, if you won't.</p>
               <p>Well but, after all, I believe I might have truſted you with my Daughter, under your Lady's Eye, Rake as you have been yourſelf. And Fame ſays wrong, if you have not been for your Time, a bolder Sinner than ever I was, (with your Maxim of touching Ladies Hearts, without wounding their Ears, which made ſurer Work with them, that was all)

tho' 'tis to be hoped you are now reformed; and if you are, the whole Country round you, Eaſt, Weſt, North and South, owe great Obligations to your fair Reclaimer. But here is a fine prim young Fellow coming out of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> with one Eſtate in one County, another in another, and Jointures and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his Hands, and more Wit in his Head, as well as more Money in his Pocket, than he can tell what to do with, to viſit our <hi>Polly</hi>; tho' I tell her I much queſtion the former Quality, his Wit, if he is for marrying.—And would you have her be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending your Wife's Nurſery, when ſhe may poſſibly be put in a Way to have a Raree-ſhew of her <hi>own?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then is the Reaſon I cannot comply with your kind Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>'s Requeſt. But if this Matter ſhould go off; if he ſhould not like <hi>her,</hi> or ſhe <hi>him;</hi> or if I ſhould not like <hi>his</hi> Terms, or he <hi>mine</hi>;—or, ſtill another <hi>Or,</hi> if he ſhould like <hi>Nancy</hi> better — why, then, perhaps, if <hi>Polly</hi> be a good Girl, I may truſt to her Virtue, and to your Honour, and let her go for a Month or two (for the Devil's in you, if you'd attempt to abuſe ſuch a generous Confidence) —As to the Superiority of Beauty in your own Lady, I depend nothing on that, with you young Fellows, to whom Variety has generally greater Charms.</p>
               <p>Now, when I have ſaid this, and when I ſay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I can forgive your ſevere Lady, and your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too, (who, however, are leſs to be excus'd in the Airs you aſſume, which looks like one Chimney-ſweeper calling another ſooty Raſcal) I give a Proof of my Charity, which I hope with Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Multitude of Faults; and the rather, ſince, tho' I cannot be a <hi>Follower</hi> of her Virtue in the ſtricteſt Senſe, I can be an <hi>Admirer</hi> of it; and that is ſome little Merit: And indeed all that can be at preſent pleaded by <hi>yourſelf,</hi> I doubt, any more than</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>My honoured and dear Parents,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Hope you will excuſe my long Silence, which has been owing to ſeveral Cauſes, and having had nothing new to entertain you with: And yet this laſt is but a poor Excuſe neither to you, who think every trifling Subject agreeable from your Daughter.</p>
               <p>I daily expect here my Lord and Lady <hi>Davers.</hi> This gives me no ſmall Pleaſure, and yet it is mingled with ſome Uneaſineſs at times, leſt I ſhould not, when view'd ſo intimately near, behave myſelf an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably to her Ladyſhip's Expectations. But this I reſolve upon, I will not endeavour to move out of the Sphere of my own Capacity, in order to emulate her Ladyſhip. She has, and muſt have, Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, by Converſation, as well as Education, which it would be Arrogance in me to aſſume, or to think of imitating.</p>
               <p>All that I will attempt to do, therefore, ſhall be, to ſhew ſuch a reſpectful Obligingneſs to my Lady, as ſhall be conſiſtent with the Condition to which I am raiſed; that ſo her Ladyſhip may not have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reproach me of Pride in my Exaltation, nor her dear Brother to rebuke me for Meanneſs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending: And, as to my Family Management, I am the leſs afraid of Inſpection, becauſe by the natural Byaſs of my own Mind, I bleſs God, I am above dark Reſerves, and have not one ſelfiſh or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did View, that ſhould make me wiſh to avoid the moſt ſcrutinizing Eye.</p>
               <p>I have begun a Correſpondence with Miſs <hi>Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> a young Lady of uncommon Merit. But you know her Character from my former Writings. She is very ſolicitous to hear of every thing that concerns
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0272600703:150"/>
me, and particularly how Lady <hi>Davers</hi> and I agree together. I loved her from the Moment I ſaw her firſt; for ſhe has the leaſt Pride, and the moſt Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and ſolid Thought, I ever knew in a young Lady, and knows not what it is to envy any one. I ſhall write to her often: And as I ſhall have ſo many Avocations beſides to fill up my Time, I know you will excuſe me, if I procure from Miſs, as I hope to do, the Return of my Letters to her, for your Peruſal, and the Entertainment of your Leiſure Hours. This will give you, from time to time, the Accounts you deſire of all that happens here. But as to what relates to our own Particulars, I beg you will never ſpare writing, as I ſhall not anſwering; for it is one of my greateſt Delights, that I have ſuch dear, ſuch worthy Parents, (as, I hope in God, I long ſhall) to bleſs me, and to correſpond with me.</p>
               <p>The Papers I ſend herewith will afford you ſome Diverſion; particularly, thoſe relating to Sir <hi>Simon Darnford</hi>; and I muſt deſire, that when you have peruſed them, (as well as what I ſhall ſend for the future) you will return them to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> gave me great Pleaſure, on his laſt Return from you, in his Account of your Health, and the Satisfaction you take in your happy Lot; and I muſt recite to you a brief Converſation, on this Occaſion, that, I dare ſay, will pleaſe you as much as it did me.</p>
               <p>After he had been adjuſting ſome Affairs with his dear Principal, which took them up two Hours, my beſt Beloved ſent for me.—My Dear, ſaid he, take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Hand, and ſeating me down by him, and making the good old Gentleman ſit down, (for he will always riſe at my Approach) Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> and I have ſettled in two Hours ſome Accounts, which would have taken up as many Months with ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But never was an exacter or more methodical
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0272600703:151"/>
Accomptant than Mr. <hi>Longman:</hi> He gives me, (greatly to my Satisfaction, becauſe I know it will delight you) an Account of the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Concern, and of the Pleaſure your Father and Mother take in it.— Now, my Charmer, ſaid he, I ſee your ſweet Eyes begin to gliſten:—O how this Subject raiſes your whole Soul to the Windows of it! — Never was ſo dutiful a Daughter, Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> and never did Parents better deſerve a Daughter's Duty!</p>
               <p>I endeavour'd before Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> to rein in a Gratitude, that my throbbing Heart confeſſed thro' my Handkerchief, as I could perceive: But the good old Gentleman could not hinder his from ſhewiug it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his worthy Eyes, to ſee how much I was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd — <hi>oppreſs'd,</hi> I ſhould ſay, with the deareſt Gentleman's tender Goodneſs to me, and kind Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.—Excuſe me, Sir, excuſe me, Madam, ſaid he, wiping his Cheeks: My Delight to ſee ſuch Merit ſo juſtly rewarded, will not be contained, I think.— And ſo he got up, and walked to the Window.</p>
               <p>Well, good Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> ſaid I, as he returned towards us, you give me the Pleaſure to know, that my Father and Mother are well; and happy then they <hi>muſt</hi> be, in a Goodneſs and Bounty, that I, and many more, rejoice in.</p>
               <p>Well and happy, Madam! — Ay that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! And a worthier Couple never lived, I aſſure you. Moſt nobly do they go on, in the Farm. Your Honour's one of the happieſt Gentlemen in the World. All the Good you do, returns upon you in a Trice. It may well be ſaid. <hi>You caſt your Bread upon the Waters</hi>; for it preſently comes to you again, richer and heavier than when you threw it in. All the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Tenants, Madam, are hugely delighted with their good Steward: Every thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers under his Management: The Gentry love both
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0272600703:152"/>
him and my Dame; and the poor People adore them. Indeed they do a Pow'r of Good, in viſiting their poor Neighbours, and giving them Cordials, and ſuch-like; inſomuch that Colicks, Agues, and twenty Diſtempers, nipp'd in the Bud, fly before them. So that I reckon the Doctors will ſoon be the only Enemies they have in the World: For, in a while, there will be no Occaſion for one within ten Miles of their Habitation.</p>
               <p>In this manner ran on Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> to my inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Delight, you may believe; and when he withdrew, 'Tis an honeſt Soul, ſaid my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I love him for his reſpectful Love to my Angel, and his Value for the worthy Pair. Very glad I am, that every thing anſwers <hi>their</hi> Wiſhes. May they long live, and be happy!</p>
               <p>The dear Gentleman makes me ſpring to his Arms, whenever he touches this String: For he ſpeaks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thus generouſly and kindly of you; and is glad to hear, he ſays, that you don't live only to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And now-and-then adds, That your Prudence and mine do more Credit to his Choice, than might have been done him by an Alliance with the firſt Quality: Since every Mouth, he is pleaſed to ſay, is full of our Merits. How pleaſing, how tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather, my dear Parents, muſt this Goodneſs be to your happy Daughter! And how could I forbear repeating theſe kind Things to you, that you may ſee how well every thing is taken that you do?</p>
               <p>When the expected Viſit from Lord and Lady <hi>Davers</hi> is over, the approaching Winter will carry us to <hi>London</hi>; and as I ſhall then be nearer to you, we may more frequently hear from one another, which, to be ſure, will be a great Heightening to my Pleaſures.</p>
               <p>But I have ſuch an Account given me of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities to which Perſons are expoſed there, along
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0272600703:153"/>
with the publick Diverſions, that it takes off a little from the Satisfaction I ſhould otherwiſe have in the Thought of going thither. For they ſay, Quarrels, and Duels, and Gallantries, as they are called, ſo often happen at <hi>London,</hi> that thoſe Enormities are heard of without the leaſt Wonder or Surprize.</p>
               <p>This makes me very thoughtful at times. But God, I hope, will preſerve our deareſt Benefactor, and continue to me his Affection, and then I ſhall be always happy; eſpecially while your Healths and Felicity confirm and crown the Delights of</p>

               <p>IT may not be improper to mention ourſelves, what the Nature of the Kindneſſes is which we confer on our poor Neighbours, and the labouring People, leſt it ſhould be ſurmiſed by any body, that we are laviſhing away Wealth that is not our own. Not that we fear either your honoured Husband or you will ſuſpect any ſuch Matter, or that the worthy Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> would inſinuate as much; for he ſaw what we did, and was highly pleaſed with it, and ſaid he would make ſuch a Report of it as you write he did. What we do is in ſmall Things, tho' the Good we hope from them is not ſmall perhaps: And if a very diſtreſsful Caſe ſhould happen among our poor Neighbours, that would require any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and the Objects be deſerving, we would acquaint you with it, and leave it to you to do as God ſhall direct you.</p>
               <p>But this, indeed, we have done, and continue to do: We have furniſhed ourſelves with ſimple Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0272600703:154"/>
and Cordials of ſeveral Sorts; and when in a hot ſultry Day, I ſee poor labouring Creatures ready to faint and drop down, if they are only fatigued, I order them a Mouthful of Bread or ſo, and a Cup of good Ale or Beer, and this makes them go about their Buſineſs with new Spirits; and when they bleſs me for it, I tell them they muſt bleſs the good 'Squire, from whoſe Bounty, next to God, it all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds. If any are ill, I give them a Cordial; and we have been the Means of ſetting up ſeveral poor Creatures who have labour'd under Colicky and Aguiſh Diſorders, or have been taken with ſlight Stomach Ailments. And nothing is loſt by it, my dear Child; for poor People have as grateful Souls as any body; and it would delight your dear Heart to ſee how many drooping Spirits we have raiſed, and how, in an Hour or two, ſome of them, after a little cordial Refreſhment, from languiſhing under an Hedge, or behind a Hay-ſtack, have skipped about, as nimble as Deer, whiſtling and ſinging, and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Alacrity their ſeveral Imployments; and inſtead of curſing and ſwearing, as is the Manner of ſome wicked Wretches, nothing but Bleſſings and Praiſes poured out of their glad Hearts upon his Honour and you; calling me their Father and Friend, and telling me, they will live and die for me, and my Wife; and that we ſhall never want an induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Servant to do his Honour's Buſineſs, or to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the Farm I am bleſſed in. And in like ſort, we communicate to our ſick or wanting Neighbours, even altho' they be not Tenants to the Eſtate.</p>
               <p>Come, my dear Child, you are happy, very happy, to be ſure you are; and, if it <hi>can</hi> be, may you be yet happier and happier! But ſtill I verily think you cannot be more happy than your Father and Mother, except in this one thing, That all <hi>our</hi> Happineſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, proceeds from you; and, as other Parents
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0272600703:155"/>
bleſs their Children with Plenty and Benefits, you have bleſs'd your Parents (or your honoured Husband rather for your ſake) with all the good Things this World can afford.</p>
               <p>The Papers you ſend us are the Joy of our Leiſure Hours; and you are kind, beyond all Expreſſion, in taking care to oblige us with them. We know how your Time is taken up, and ought to be very well contented, if but now-and-then you let us hear of your Health and Welfare. But it is not enough with ſuch a good Daughter, that you have made our Lives <hi>comfortable,</hi> but you will make them <hi>joyful</hi> too, by communicating to us all that befals you: And then you write ſo piouſly, and with ſuch a Senſe of God's Goodneſs to you, and intermix ſuch good Reflections in your Writings, that, whether it be our partial Love or not, I cannot tell, but, truly, we think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body comes up to you: And you make our Hearts and our Eyes ſo often overflow, as we read, that we join Hand in Hand together, and I ſay to her, Bleſſed be God, and bleſſed be you, my Dear; and ſhe in the ſame Breath, Bleſſed be God, and you, my Love— For ſuch a Daughter, ſays the one — For ſuch a Daughter, ſays the other —And ſhe has your own ſweet Temper, cry I —And ſhe has your own honeſt Heart, cries ſhe: And ſo we go on, bleſſing God, and bleſſing you, and bleſſing your Spouſe, and bleſſing ourſelves! — Is any Happineſs like our Happineſs, my dear Daughter!</p>
               <p>Really and indeed, we are ſo inraptur'd with your Writings, that when our Spirits flag, thro' the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Years, that have begun to take hold of us, we have recourſe to ſome of your Papers: Come, my Dear, cry I, what ſay you to a Banquet now? — She knows what I mean. With all my Heart, ſays ſhe. — So I read, altho' it be on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> ſo good are your Letters; and, you muſt know, I have Copies
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0272600703:156"/>
of a many of them: And after a little while, we are as much alive and brisk, as if we had had no Flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at all, and return to the Duties of the Day with double Delight.</p>
               <p>Conſider then, my dear Child, what Joy your Writings give us: And yet we are afraid of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you who have ſo much to do of other Kinds; and we are heartily glad you have found out a way to ſave Trouble to yourſelf, and rejoice us, and oblige ſo worthy a young Lady as Miſs <hi>Darnford,</hi> all at one time. I never ſhall forget her dear Goodneſs to me, and the Notice ſhe took of me at the Hall <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>Well, but how ſhall I end? And yet, what ſhall I ſay more? — Only, with my Prayers, that God will continue to you the Bleſſings and Comforts you are in Poſſeſſion of! — And pray now, be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughtful about what may happen at <hi>London</hi>; for why ſhould you let the Dread of future Evils leſſen your preſent Joys? There is no abſolute Perfection in this Life, that's true; but one would make one's ſelf as eaſy as one could. 'Tis Time enough to be troubled when Troubles come:—<hi>Sufficient unto the Day is the Evil thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rejoice then, my dear Child, as you have often ſaid you would, in your preſent Bleſſings, and leave the Event of Things to the Supreme Diſpoſer of all Events. And what have <hi>you</hi> to do, but rejoice?
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0272600703:157"/>
                  <hi>You,</hi> who cannot ſee a Sun riſe, but it is to bleſs you, and to raiſe up from their Beds Numbers to join in the Bleſſing! <hi>You</hi> who can bleſs your high-born Friends, and your low-born Parents, and obſcure Relations! who can bleſs the Rich by your Example, and the Poor by your Bounty; and bleſs beſides ſo good and ſo brave a Husband! — O my dear Child, what, let me repeat it, have <hi>you</hi> to do, but rejoice?—<hi>For many Daughters have done wiſely, but you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will only add, that every thing the 'Squire or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd is juſt upon the Point of being finiſhed.

               <p>THE Intereſt I take in every thing that concerns you, makes me very importunate to know how you approve the Gentleman, whom ſome of his beſt Friends and Well-wiſhers have recommended to your Favour. I hope he will deſerve your good Opinion, and then he muſt excel moſt of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married Gentlemen in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Papa, in his humourous Manner, mentions his large Poſſeſſions and Riches: But, indeed, were he as rich as <hi>Croeſus,</hi> he ſhould not have my Conſent, if he has no <hi>greater</hi> Merit; tho' that is what the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Parents look out for firſt: And indeed an eaſy Fortune is ſo far from being diſregardable, that, when attended with <hi>equal</hi> Merit, I think it ought to have a <hi>Preference</hi> given to it, ſuppoſing Affections
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0272600703:158"/>
diſingaged. For 'tis certain, that a Gentleman or Lady may ſtand as good a Chance for Happineſs in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with a Perſon of Fortune, as with one who has not that Advantage; and notwithſtanding I had neither Riches nor Deſcent to boaſt of, I muſt be of Opinion with thoſe, who ſay, that they never knew any body deſpiſe either, that had them. But to permit Riches to be the <hi>principal</hi> Inducement, to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of ſuperior Merit, that is the Fault which many a one ſmarts for, whether the Choice be their own, or impoſed upon them by thoſe who have a Title to their Obedience.</p>
               <p>Here is a ſaucy Body, might ſome, who have not Miſs <hi>Darnford</hi>'s kind Conſideration for her Friend, be apt to ſay, who being thus meanly deſcended, nevertheleſs preſumes to give her Opinion, in theſe high Caſes, unasked. But I have one thing, my dear Miſs, to ſay; and that is, that I think myſelf ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diveſted of Partiality to my own Caſe, that, as far as my Judgment ſhall permit, I will never have that in View, when I am preſuming to hint my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of general Rules. For, moſt ſurely, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours I have received, and the Debaſement to which my beſt Friend has ſubjected himſelf, have, for their principal Excuſe, that the Gentleman was intirely inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, had no Queſtions to ask, and had a Fortune ſufficient to make himſelf, as well as the Perſon he choſe, happy, tho' ſhe brought him nothing at all; and that he had, moreover, ſuch a Character for good Senſe, and Knowlege of the World, that nobody could impute to him any other Inducement, but that of a noble Reſolution to reward a Virtue he had ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and, I will ſay, ſo wickedly, try'd, and could not ſubdue.</p>
               <p>But why do I thus run on to Miſs <hi>Darnford,</hi> whoſe partial Friendſhip attributes to me Merits I cannot claim? I will, therefore, quit this Subject, as a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0272600703:159"/>
needleſs one to her, and proceed to what was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in my View, when I began to write; and that is, to complain of your Papa, who has, let me ſay it, done his Endeavour to ſet at Variance a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and his Wife.</p>
               <p>I will not enter into the Particulars, becauſe the Appeal is to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and it would look like invading his Prerogative, to take it into my own Hands. But I can tell Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> that he is the only Gentleman, I hope, who, when a young Perſon of my Sex asked him to make her a Preſent of a Book, would put ſuch a miſchievous Turn as he has done upon it, to her Husband!—Indeed, from the <hi>Beginning,</hi> I had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to call him a <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 249.</note> Tell-tale—But, no more of that—Yet I muſt ſay, I had rather he ſhould have flung this Book at <hi>my</hi> Head too, than to have made a ſo much worſe Uſe of it. But I came off toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, no Thanks to Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> however!—And <hi>but</hi> tolerably neither: For, my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> kept me in Suſpenſe a good while, and put me in great Flutters, before he let me into the Matter.</p>
               <p>But I was very much concerned, my dear Miſs, at firſt, till you gave a Reaſon I better liked after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, for Sir <hi>Simon</hi>'s denying your Company to me, after I had obtain'd the Favour of your Mamma's Conſent, and you were kindly inclin'd yourſelf to oblige me: And that was, that Sir <hi>Simon</hi> had a bad Opinion of the Honour of my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> For, as to that Part of his Doubt, which reflected Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour upon his dear Daughter, it was all but the Effect of his ſtrange free Humour, on purpoſe to vex you.</p>
               <p>That Gentleman muſt be the moſt abandon'd of Men, who would attempt any thing againſt the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Lady intruſted to his Protection: And I am
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0272600703:160"/>
grieved, methinks, that the dear Gentleman, who is the better Part of myſelf, and has, to his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement, acted ſo honourably by me, ſhould be thought capable of ſo much Vileneſs. But forgive me, Miſs; it is only Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> I dare ſay, who could think ſo hardly of him: And I am in great Hope, for the Honour of the <hi>preſent</hi> Age, (quite contrary to the Aſperſion, that every Age grows worſe and worſe) that the <hi>laſt,</hi> if it produc'd People ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch Attempts, was wickeder than this.</p>
               <p>Bad as my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Deſigns and Attempts were upon me, I can, now I am ſet above fearing them, and am inabled to reflect upon them with leſs Terror and Apprehenſion, be earneſt, for his own dear ſake, to think him not, even <hi>then,</hi> the worſt of Men, tho' bad enough in all Conſcience: For have we not heard of thoſe that have had no Remorſe or Compunction at all, and have actually executed all their vile Purpoſes, when a poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was in their Power?—Yet (indeed, after ſore Trials, that's true!) did not God turn his Heart? And altho' I was ſtill helpleſs, and without any Friend in the World, and in the Hands of a poor vile Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, to be ſure, was worſe than he, provoking him to ruin me, and ſo wholly in his Power, that I durſt not diſobey him, whether he bid me come to him, or be gone from him, as he was pleaſed, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with me; yet, I ſay, for all this, did he not overcome his criminal Paſſion, and entertain an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable one, tho' to his poor Servant Girl; and brave the World, and the World's Cenſures, and marry me?</p>
               <p>And does not this ſhew, that the Seeds of Honour were kept alive in his Heart, tho' choaked or kept from ſprouting forth, for a Time, by the Weeds of Senſuality, Pride, and youthful Impetuoſity? And by cutting down the latter, have not the former
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0272600703:161"/>
taken Root, have they not ſhot out, and, in their turn, <hi>kept down</hi> at leaſt, the depreſſed Weeds? And who now lives more virtuouſly than Mr. <hi>B.</hi>?</p>
               <p>Let me tell you, my dear Miſs, that I have not heard of many Inſtances of Gentlemen, who, having deſigned vilely, have ſtopt ſhort, and acted ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably; and who continue to act ſo nobly: And I have great Confidence, that he will, in time, be as pious, as he is now moral; for tho' he has a few bad No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he talks of now-and-then, as Polygamy, and ſuch-like, which indeed give me a little ſerious Thought ſometimes, becauſe a Man is too apt to practiſe what he has perſuaded himſelf to believe is no Crime; yet, I hope, they are owing more to the Livelineſs of his Wit, (a wild Quality, which does not always confine itſelf to proper Exerciſes) than to his Judgment. And if I can but ſee the firſt three or four Months Reſidence over in that wicked <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> (which, they ſay, is ſo ſeducing a Place) without adding to my Apprehenſions, how happy ſhall I be!</p>
               <p>So much, ſlightly, have I thought proper to ſay in behalf of my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> For a good Wife can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but hope for a ſweeter and more elevated Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panionſhip, (if her preſumptuous Heart makes her look upward with Hope herſelf) than this tranſitory State can afford us. And what a ſad Caſe is hers, who being as exemplary as human Frailty will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her to be, looks forward upon the Partner of her adverſe and of her proſperous Eſtate, the Husband of her Boſom, the Father of her Children, the Head of her Family, as a poor unhappy Soul, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd to a ſeparate and a miſerable Exiſtence for ever!—O my dear Miſs!—How can ſuch a Thought be ſupportable!—But what high Conſolation, what Tranſport rather, at times, muſt hers be, who ſhall be bleſs'd with the Hope of being an humble In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to reclaim ſuch a dear, dear, thrice dear
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0272600703:162"/>
Partner!— And that, Heart in Heart, and Hand in Hand, they ſhall one Day iſſue forth from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred State into a bleſſed Eternity, benefited by each other's Example—I will lay down my Pen, and injoy the rich Thought for a few Moments!</p>
               <p>Now, my dear Miſs, let me, as a Subject very pleaſing to me, touch upon your kind Mention of the worthy Mr. <hi>Peters</hi>'s Sentiments in relation to that Part of his Conduct to me, which (oppreſs'd by the Terrors and Apprehenſions to which I was ſubjected) once indeed I cenſured; and ſo much the readier, as I had ever ſo great an Honour for his Cloth, that I thought, to be a Clergyman, and all that was compaſſionate, good and virtuous, was the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>But when I came to know Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> I had a high Opinion of his Worthineſs; and as no one can be perfect in this Life, thus I thought to myſelf: How hard was then my Lot, to be a Cauſe of Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to ſo worthy a Heart! To be ſure, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who knows ſo well, and practiſes ſo well, his Duty, in every other Inſtance, and preaches it ſo efficaciouſly to others, muſt have been <hi>one Day</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that it would not have misbecome his Function and Character to have afforded that Protection to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Innocence, which was requeſted of him; and how would it have grieved his conſiderate Mind, had my Ruin been completed, that he did not!</p>
               <p>But as he had once a Name-ſake, as one may ſay, that failed in a much greater Inſtance, let not my Want of Charity exceed his Fault; but let me look upon it as an Infirmity, to which the moſt perfect are liable: I was a Stranger to him; a Servant Girl carry'd off by her Maſter, a young Gentleman of violent and lawleſs Paſſions; who, in this very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0272600703:163"/>
ſhew'd how much in Earneſt he was ſet upon effecting all his vile Purpoſes; and whoſe Heart altho' <hi>God</hi> might touch, it was not probable any leſſer Influence could.</p>
               <p>Then he was not ſure, that tho' he might aſſiſt my Eſcape, I might not afterwards fall again into the Hands of ſo determin'd a Violator; and that Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty would not, with ſuch an one, inhance his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to overcome all Obſtacles.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he might think, that the Perſon, who was moving him to this worthy Meaſure, might poſſibly be ſeeking to gratify a View of his own; and that while he was endeavouring to ſave, to outwatd Appearance, a Virtue in Danger, he was, in reality, only helping (at the Hazard of expoſing himſelf to the Vindictiveneſs of a violent Temper, and a rich Neighbour, who had Power as well as Will to reſent) another to a Wife; for ſuch was his <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 175. <hi>l.</hi> 4.</note> Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, groundleſs, intirely groundleſs as it was, tho' not improbable, as it might ſeem to him.</p>
               <p>Then again, the ſad Examples ſet by too many <hi>European</hi> Sovereigns, in whom the <hi>Royal</hi> and <hi>Prieſtly Offices</hi> are united (for are not Kings the <hi>Lord's Anointed?</hi>); and the little Scruple which many Perſons, Right Reverend by their Functions and Characters, too generally make, to pay ſordid Court and Viſits (far from bearing their Teſtimony againſt ſuch Practices) even to Concubines, who have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to promote them<note n="†" place="bottom">That theſe Arguments were pleaded by Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> See <hi>Vol. I.</hi> p. <hi>175.</hi> l. <hi>12, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>, are no ſmall Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to a private Clergyman, to do his Duty, and to make himſelf Enemies among his powerful Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for the Cauſe of Virtue. And eſpecially (forgive me, dear Sir <hi>Simon Darnford,</hi> if you ſhould
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0272600703:164"/>
ſee this) when an eminent Magiſtrate, one of the principal Gentlemen of the County, of an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Fortune, who had fine young Ladies to his Daughters, (who had nothing but their ſuperior Conditions, not their Sex, to exempt them from like Attempts) a Juſtice of Peace, and of the <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> refuſed to BE a <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol I. <hi>p.</hi> 174. <hi>l.</hi> 26.</note> Juſtice, tho' ſuch a Breach of the <hi>Peace</hi> was made, and ſuch a Violation of <hi>Morals</hi> plainly intended. This, I ſay, muſt add to the Diſcouragement of a Gentleman a little too diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and timorous of himſelf: And who having no one to ſecond him, had he afforded me his Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt have ſtood alone in the Gap, and made to himſelf, in an active Gentleman, an Enemy who had a thouſand deſirable Qualities to make one wiſh him for a Friend.</p>
               <p>For all theſe Conſiderations, I think my ſelf obliged to pity, rather than too rigorouſly to cenſure, the worthy Gentleman. And I muſt and will always reſpect him: And thank him a thouſand times, my dear Miſs, in my Name, for his Goodneſs, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to acknowlege, by your dear Hand, his Infirmity, as ſuch: For this gives an excellent Proof of the natural Worthineſs of his Heart; and that it is beneath him to ſeek to extenuate a Fault, when he thinks he has committed one.</p>
               <p>Indeed, my dear Friend, I have ſo much Honour for the Clergy of all Degrees, that I never forget in my Prayers, one Article, That God will make them burning and ſhining Lights to the World; ſince ſo much depends on their Miniſtry and Examples, as well with reſpect to our publick as private Duties. Nor ſhall the Faults of a Few make Impreſſion upon me to the Diſadvantage of the Order. For I am afraid a very cenſorious Temper, in this reſpect, is too
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0272600703:165"/>
generally the Indication of an uncharitable, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a profligate Heart, levelling Characters, in order to cover ſome inward Pride or ſecret Enormities, which they are aſhamed to avow, and will not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to amend.</p>
               <p>Forgive, my dear Miſs, this tedious Scribble. I cannot for my Life write ſhort Letters to thoſe I love. And let me hope, that you will favour me with an Account of your new Affair, and how you proceed in it; and with ſuch of your Converſations, as may give me ſome Notion of a polite Courtſhip. For, alas! my dear Miſs, your poor Friend knows nothing of this. All her Courtſhip was ſometimes a haſty Snatch of the Hand, a black and blue Gripe of the Arm, and, Whither now!—Come, to me, when I bid you!—And Saucy-face, and Creature, and ſuch-like, on his Part—with Fear and Trembling on mine; and—I will, I will!—Good Sir, have Mercy! At other times, a Scream, and nobody to hear or mind me; and with uplift Hands, bent Knees, and tearful Eyes—For God's ſake, pity your poor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant!</p>
               <p>This, my dear Miſs, was the hard Treatment that attended my Courtſhip.—Pray, then, let me know, how Gentlemen court their Equals in Degree; how they look when they addreſs you, with their Knees bent, ſighing, ſupplicating, and <hi>all that,</hi> as Sir <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſays, with the Words Slave, Servant, Admirer, continually at their Tongues Ends.</p>
               <p>But after all, it will be found, I believe, that, be the Language and Behaviour ever ſo obſequious, it is all deſigned to end alike.—The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> of the politeſt Addreſs, is, I am now, dear Madam, your humble Servant: Pray be ſo good as to let me be your Maſter. Yes, and thank you too, ſays the Lady's Heart, tho' not her Lips, if ſhe likes him. And ſo they go to Church together: And, in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0272600703:166"/>
Concluſion, it will be happy, if theſe obſequious Courtſhips end no worſe than my frightful one.</p>
               <p>But I am convinc'd, that with a Man of Senſe, a Woman of tolerable Prudence <hi>muſt</hi> be happy.</p>
               <p>That whenever you marry, it may be to ſuch a Man, who then muſt value you as you deſerve, and make you as happy as I now am, notwithſtanding all that's paſt, wiſhes and prays</p>

               <p>YOU charm us all, with your Letters. Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> ſays he will never go to bed, nor riſe, but he will pray for you, and deſires I will return his thankful Acknowlegements for your favourable Opinion of him, and kind Allowances. If there be an Angel on Earth, he ſays you are one. My Papa, altho' he has ſeen your ſtinging Reflection upon his Refuſal to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect you, is delighted with you too; and ſays, when you come down to <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> again, he will be <hi>undertaken</hi> by you in good Earneſt; for he thinks he was wrong to deny you his Protection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0272600703:167"/>We are pleas'd with your Apology for Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 'Tis ſo much the Part of a good Wife to extenuate her Husband's Faults, and make the beſt of his bad Qualities, in order to give the World a good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him; that, together with the affecting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of your Humility, in looking back with ſo much true Greatneſs of Mind, to what you were, make us all join to admire you, and own, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body can deſerve what you deſerve.</p>
               <p>Yet I am ſorry, my dear Friend, to find, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your Defence of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that you have any Apprehenſions about <hi>London.</hi> 'Tis pity any thing ſhould give you Concern. As to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s talking in Favour of Polygamy, you cannot expect, that he can ſhake off all his bad Notions at once. And it muſt be a great Comfort to you, that his <hi>Actions</hi> do not correſpond, and that his Liberties have been reduced to <hi>Notions</hi> only. In time, we hope that he will be every thing you wiſh him. If not, with ſuch an Example before him, he will be the more culpable.</p>
               <p>We all ſmiled at the Deſcription of your own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Courtſhip. And as they ſay, the Days of Courtſhip are the happieſt Part of Life, if we had not known that your Days of Marriage are happier by far, than any other body's Courtſhip, we muſt needs have pity'd you. But as the one were Days of Trial and Temptation, the other are Days of Reward and Happineſs: May the laſt always continue to be ſo, and you'll have no Occaſion to think any body happier than Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thank you heartily for your good Wiſhes as to the Man of Senſe. Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> has been here, and continues his Viſits. He is a lively Gentleman, well enough in his Perſon, has a tolerable Character, yet loves Company, and will take his Bottle freely; my Papa likes him ne'er the worſe for that: He talks a good deal; dreſſes gay, and even richly, and ſeems to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0272600703:168"/>
like his own Perſon very well: No great Pleaſure this for a Lady to look forward to; yet he falls far ſhort of that genteel Eaſe, and graceful Behaviour, which diſtinguiſh your Mr. <hi>B.</hi> from any body I know.</p>
               <p>I wiſh Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> would apply to my Siſter. She is an ill-natur'd Girl; but would make a good Wife, I hope; and I fanſy ſhe'd like him well enough. I can't ſay I do. He laughs too much; has ſomething boiſterous in his Converſation; his Complaiſance is not a pretty Complaiſance: He is well vers'd in Country Sports; and my Papa loves him for that too, and ſays, He is a moſt accompliſh'd Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: Yes, cry I, as Gentlemen go—You <hi>muſt</hi> be ſaucy, ſays Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> and when a Partrige is put on your Plate, ſnuff up your Noſe at it, when, were you kept a little hungry, you'd have leapt at a coarſer Bird.</p>
               <p>I know ſome Gentlemens Partriges, Sir, cry'd I, no better than rank Wigeons, and far ſhort of a Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gooſe. He call'd me one of his free Names.</p>
               <p>But I have broken my Mind to my dear, my indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Mamma, who tells me, ſhe will do me all the Pleaſure ſhe can; but would be loth the youngeſt Daughter ſhould <hi>go firſt,</hi> as ſhe calls it. But if I could come and live with you a little now-and-then, I did not care who marry'd, unleſs ſuch an one offer'd, as I never expect.</p>
               <p>I have great Hope, the Gentleman will be eaſily perſuaded to quit me for <hi>Nancy;</hi> for I ſee he has not Delicacy enough to love with any great Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He ſays, as my Mamma tells me by the bye, that I am the handſomeſt and beſt humour'd; and he has found out, as he thinks, that I have ſome Wit, and have Eaſe and Freedom (and he tacks Innocence to them) in my Addreſs and Converſation. 'Tis well for me, <hi>he</hi> is of this Opinion; for if he thinks juſtly, which I much queſtion, <hi>any body</hi> may think ſo ſtill much more; for I have been far from taking
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0272600703:169"/>
Pains to ingage his good Word, having been under more Reſerve to him, than ever I was before to any body.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I can't help it; for the Gentleman is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward without Delicacy; and (pardon me, Sir <hi>Simon</hi>) my Papa has not one bit of it neither: But is for puſhing Matters on, with his rough Raillery, that puts me out of Countenance, and has already adjuſted the ſordid Part of the Preliminaries, as he tells me.</p>
               <p>Yet I hope <hi>Nancy</hi>'s 3000 <hi>l.</hi> Fortune more than I am likely to have <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>This is all that occurs worthy of Notice from us: But from you, we expect an Account of Lady <hi>Davers</hi>'s Viſit, and of the Converſations that offer among you; and you have ſo delightful a way of making every thing momentous, either by your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or Reflections, or both, that we long for every Poſt-Day, in hopes of the Pleaſure of a Letter.— And yours I will always carefully preſerve, as ſo many Teſtimonies of the Honour I receive in this Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence: Which will be always eſteemed, as it deſerves, by, my dear Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>

                  <p>Yeſterday about Six in the Evening arrived here my Lord and Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> their Nephew, and the Counteſs of <hi>C.</hi> Mother of Lady <hi>Betty,</hi> whom we did not expect, but took it for the greater Favour. It ſeems her Ladyſhip long'd, as ſhe ſaid, to ſee <hi>me</hi>; and this was her principal Inducement. The two Ladies, and their two Women, were in Lord <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>'s Coach and Six, and my Lord and his Nephew rode on Horſeback, attended with a Train of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                  <p>We had expected them to Dinner; but they could not reach Time enough; for the Counteſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little incommoded with her Journey, the Coach travelled ſlowly. My Lady would not ſuffer her Lord, nor his Nephew, to come hither before her, tho' on Horſeback, becauſe ſhe would be preſent, ſhe ſaid, when his Lordſhip first ſaw me, he having quite forgot <hi>her Mother's Pamela</hi>; that was her Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0272600703:172"/>It rained when they came in; ſo the Coach drove directly to the Door, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> receiving them there: But I was in a little Sort of Flutter, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> obſerving, made me ſit down in the Parlour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe myſelf. Where's <hi>Pamela?</hi> ſaid my Lady, as ſoon as ſhe alighted in the Paſſage.</p>
                  <p>I ſtept out, leſt ſhe ſhould take it amiſs; and ſhe took my Hand, and kiſſed me: Here, my Lady Counteſs, ſaid ſhe, preſenting me to her— Here's the Girl; ſee if I ſaid too much in Praiſe of her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs ſaluted me with a kind Pleaſure in her Eye, and ſaid, Indeed, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> you have not. 'Twould have been ſtrange, (excuſe me, Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> for I know your Story) if ſuch a fine Flower had not been tranſplanted from the Field to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                  <p>I made no Return but by a low Court'ſy to her Ladyſhip's Compliment. Then Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Hand again, preſented me to her Lord: See here, my Lord, my Mother's <hi>Pamela!</hi>— And ſee here, my Lord, ſaid her generous Brother, taking my other Hand moſt kindly, ſee here your Brother's <hi>Pamela</hi> too!</p>
                  <p>My Lord ſaluted me: I do, ſaid he to his Lady; I do, ſaid he to his Brother; and I ſee the firſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in her, that has exceeded my Expectation, when every Mouth had <hi>prepared</hi> me to expect a Wonder.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> whom every one calls Lord <hi>Jackey,</hi> after his Aunt's Example when ſhe is in good Humour with him, and who is a very <hi>young</hi> Gentleman, tho' about as old as my beſt Friend, came to me next, and ſaid, Lovelier and lovelier, by my Life! — I never ſaw your Peer, Madam.</p>
                  <p>Will you excuſe me, Miſs, all this ſeeming Vanity, for the ſake of repeating exactly what paſſed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0272600703:173"/>Well but, ſaid my Lady, taking my Hand, in her free Quality Way, which quite daſhed me, and holding it at Diſtance, and turning me half-round, her Eye fixed to my Waiſt, Let me obſerve you a little, my ſweet-fac'd Girl! — I hope I am right: — I hope you will do Credit to my Brother, as he has done you Credit.—Why do you let her lace ſo tight, Mr. <hi>B.?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was unable to look up, as you may believe, Miſs; my Face, all over Scarlet, was hid in my Boſom, and I looked ſo ſilly!—</p>
                  <p>Ay, ſaid my naughty Lady, you may well look down, my good Girl: For, to talk to thee in thy own grave Way, thou haſt verify'd the Scripture, <hi>What is done in Secret, ſhall be known on the Houſe-top.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dear my Lady! ſaid I —for ſtill ſhe kept looking at me: And her dear Brother, ſeeing my Confuſion, in Pity to me, preſs'd my bluſhing Face a Moment on his generous Breaſt; and ſaid, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> you ſhould not be thus hard upon my dear Girl, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you ſee her, and before ſo many Witneſſes: But look up, my beſt Love, take your Revenge of my Siſter, and tell her, you wiſh her in the ſame Way.</p>
                  <p>It is ſo then, ſaid my Lady: I'm glad of it with all my Heart. I will now love you ſtill better: but I almoſt doubted it, ſeeing her ſtill ſo ſlender. But if, my good Child, you lace too tight, I'll never forgive you. And ſo ſhe gave me a Kiſs of Congratulation, as ſhe ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Do you think, Miſs, I did not look very ſilly?—My Lord, ſmiling, and gazing at me from Head to Foot, Lord <hi>Jackey</hi> grinning and laughing, like an Oaf, as I then, in my Spite, thought. Indeed the Counteſs ſaid, incouragingly to me, but ſeverely on Perſons of Birth,— Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> you are as much too teizing,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0272600703:174"/>
as Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> is too baſhful. But you're a happy Man, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that your Lady's Modeſty and Baſhfulneſs are the only Marks by which we can judge ſhe is not of Quality. Lord <hi>Jackey,</hi> in the Language of ſome Character in a Play, cry'd out, <hi>A palpable Hit, by</hi> Jupiter, and laughed egregiouſly, running about from one to another, repeating the ſame Words.</p>
                  <p>We talked only upon common Topicks till Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-time, and I was all Ear, as I thought it became me; for the Counteſs had by her firſt Compliment, and by an Aſpect as noble as intelligent, obliged me to Silence, in Awe of a Superiority ſo viſible; as had Lady <hi>Davers</hi>'s free, though pleaſant, Raillery, which ſhe could not help carrying on now-and-then. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Lady <hi>Davers</hi>'s Letters had given me greater Reaſon to revere her Wit and Judgment, (high as my Reſpect for her before had carried my Notions of her Excellence) that I had formed to myſelf, when I reflected on her paſſionate Temper, and ſuch Parts of the Converſation I had had with her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in your Neighbourhood; which (however to be admired) fell ſhort of her Letters.</p>
                  <p>When we were to ſit down at Table, I looked, I ſuppoſe, a little diffidently; for I really then thought of my Lady's Anger at the Hall, when ſhe would not have permitted me to ſit at Table with her<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>See</hi> Vol. II. <hi>p</hi> 290.</note>; and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaying, Take your Place, my Dear, you keep our Friends ſtanding; I ſat down in my uſual Place. And my Lady <hi>ſaid,</hi> None of your reproaching Eye, <hi>Pamela</hi>; I know what you hint at: And every Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have receiv'd from you, has help'd to make me cenſure myſelf for my <hi>Lady-Airs,</hi> as you call 'em, you Saucebox you: I told you, I'd <hi>Lady-Airs</hi> you when I ſaw you; and you ſhall have it all in good Time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0272600703:175"/>I'm ſure, ſaid I, I ſhall have nothing from your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but what will be very agreeable: But indeed I never meant any thing particular by that, or any other Word that I wrote; nor could I think of any thing but what was highly reſpectful to your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>Lord <hi>Davers</hi> was pleaſed to ſay, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible I ſhould either write or ſpeak any thing that could be taken amiſs.</p>
                  <p>Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> after Supper, and the Servants were withdrawn, began a Diſcourſe on Titles, and ſaid, Brother, I think you ſhould hold yourſelf obliged to my Lord <hi>Davers</hi>; for he has ſpoken to Lord <hi>S.</hi> who made him a Viſit a few Days ago, to procure you a Baronet's Patent. Your Eſtate, and the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure you make in the World, are ſo conſiderable, and your Family beſides is ſo antient, that, methinks, you ſhould wiſh for ſome Diſtinction of that Sort.</p>
                  <p>Yes, Brother, ſaid my Lord, I did mention it to Lord <hi>S.</hi> and told him, withal, that it was without your Knowlege or Deſire, that I ſpoke about it; and I was not very ſure you would accept of it; but 'tis a thing your Siſter has wiſh'd for a good while.</p>
                  <p>What Anſwer did my Lord <hi>S.</hi> make to it? ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſaid, We, meaning the Miniſters, I ſuppoſe, ſhould be glad to oblige a Gentleman of Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Figure in the World; but you mention it ſo ſlightly, that you can hardly expect Courtiers will tender it to any Gentleman that is ſo indifferent about it; for, Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> we ſeldom grant Honours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a View, I tell you that, ſaid he, ſmiling.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>S.</hi> might mention this as a Jeſt, return'd Mr. <hi>B.</hi> but he ſpoke the Truth. But your Lordſhip ſaid well, that I was indifferent about it. 'Tis true, 'tis an hereditary Title: But the rich Citizens, who
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0272600703:176"/>
uſed to be ſatisfy'd with the Title of Knights, (till they made it ſo common, that it was brought into as great Contempt as the <note n="*" place="bottom">This Order was become ſo ſcandalouſly common in <hi>France,</hi> that, in order to ſuppreſs it, the Hangman was veſted with the Enſigns of it, which effectually aboliſhed it.</note>
                     <hi>French</hi> Knights of St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> and nobody elſe cared to accept of it) now are ambitious of this; and, I take it, it is haſtening apace into like Diſrepute. Beſides, 'tis a novel Honour, and what our Anceſtors, who lived at its Inſtitution, would never accept of. But were it a Peerage they would give me, which has ſome eſſential Privileges and Splendors attached to it, that would make it deſirable to ſome Men, I would not enter into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions for it. Titles at beſt, added he, are but Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; and he that has the Subſtance ſhould be above valuing them; for who that has the whole Bird, would pride himſelf upon a ſingle Feather?</p>
                  <p>But, ſaid my Lady, altho' I acknowlege, that the Inſtitution is of late Date, yet as abroad, as well as at home, it is regarded as a Title of Dignity, and it is ſuppoſed, that the beſt Families among the Gentry are of it, I ſhould be glad you would accept of it. And as to Citizens being of it, they are not many; and ſome of them, or their immediate Deſcendants however, have bought themſelves into the Peerage itſelf of the one Kingdom or the other.</p>
                  <p>As to what it is looked upon Abroad, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that is of no Weight at all; for when an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> travels, be he of what Degree he will, if he has an Equipage, and ſquanders his Money away, he is a Lord of courſe with Foreigners: And therefore Sir <hi>Such-a-one</hi> is rather a Diminution to him, as it fixes him down to a lower Title than his Vanity would perhaps make him aſpire to be thought in the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of. Then, as to Citizens, in a Trading Nation like this, I am not diſpleaſed in the main, with ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0272600703:177"/>
the overgrown ones creeping into nominal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; and we have ſo many of our firſt Titled Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies who have ally'd themſelves to Trade, (whoſe Inducements were Money only) that it ceaſes to be either a Wonder as to the Fact, or a Diſgrace to the Honour.</p>
                  <p>Well, Brother, ſaid my Lady, I will tell you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Thing may be had for asking for: If you will but go to Court, and deſire to kiſs the King's Hand, that will be all the Trouble you'll have; and pray now oblige me in it.</p>
                  <p>If a Title would make me either a better or a wiſer Man, reply'd Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I would imbrace it with Pleaſure. Beſides, I am not ſo intirely ſatisfied with ſome of the Meaſures now purſuing, as to owe any Obligation to the Miniſters. Accepting of a ſmall Title from them, is but like putting on their Badge, or liſting under their Banners; like a certain Lord we all know, who accepted of one Degree more of Title to ſhew he was theirs, and would not have a higher, leſt it ſhould be thought a Satisfaction tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to half the Penſion he demanded: And could I be eaſy to have it ſuppoſed, that I was an ingrateful Man for voting as I pleaſed, becauſe they gave me the Title of a Baronet?</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs ſaid, The World always thought Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was a Gentleman of moderate Principles, and not attached to any Party; and it was her Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it was far from being inconſiſtent with any Gentleman's Honour and Independency, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a Title from a Prince he acknowleged as his Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>'Tis very true, Madam, reply'd Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that I am attach'd to no Party, and never will; and I have a mean Opinion of many of the Heads of both: Nay, I will ſay further, that I wiſh at my Heart, the Gentlemen in the Adminiſtration would purſue ſuch
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0272600703:178"/>
Meaſures, that I could give them every Vote; as I always will every one that I can; and I have no very high Opinion of thoſe who, right or wrong, would diſtreſs or imbaraſs a Government. For this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that our Governors cannot be always in the wrong; and he therefore who never gives them a Vote, muſt probably be as often out of the Way as they, and muſt, moreover, have ſome View he will not own. But in a Country like ours, where each of the Legiſlative Powers is in a Manner independent, and where they are deſigned as mutual Checks upon each other, I have, notwithſtanding, ſo great an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Neceſſity of an Oppoſition ſometimes, that I am convinc'd it is that which muſt preſerve our Conſtitution. I will therefore be a <hi>Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> in the true Senſe of the Word, and will accept of no Favour that ſhall make any one think I would <hi>not</hi> be of the Oppoſition when I think it a neceſſary one; as, on the other hand, I ſhould ſcorn to make myſelf a Round to any Man's Ladder of Preferment, or a Caballer for the ſake of my own.</p>
                  <p>You ſay well, Brother, return'd Lady <hi>Davers</hi>; but you may undoubtedly keep your own Principles and Independency, and yet pay your Duty to the King, and accept of this Title; for your Family and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune will be a greater Ornament to the Title, than the Title to you.</p>
                  <p>Then, what Occaſion have I for it, if that be the Caſe, Madam?</p>
                  <p>Why, I can't ſay but I ſhould be glad you had it, for your Family's ſake, as it is an hereditary Honour. Then it would mend the Style of your Spouſe here; for the good Girl is at ſuch a Loſs for an Epithet when ſhe writes, that I ſee the Conſtraint ſhe lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. It is, <hi>My dear Gentleman, My beſt Friend, My Benefactor, My dear Mr.</hi> B.; whereas Sir <hi>William</hi>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0272600703:179"/>
would turn off her Periods more roundly, and no other ſofter Epithet would be wanting.</p>
                  <p>To me, reply'd he, who always deſire to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed as my <hi>Pamela</hi>'s beſt Friend, and think it an Honour to be called <hi>her dear Mr.</hi> B. and <hi>her dear Gentleman,</hi> this Reaſon weighs very little, unleſs there were no other Sir <hi>William</hi> in the Kingdom than her Sir <hi>William</hi>; for I am very emulous of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, I can tell you, and think it no ſmall Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>I bluſhed at this too great Honour, before ſuch Company, and was afraid my Lady would be a little piqu'd at it. But, after a Pauſe, ſhe ſaid, Well then, Brother, will you let <hi>Pamela</hi> decide upon this Point?</p>
                  <p>Rightly put, ſaid the Counteſs. Pray let Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> chuſe for you, Sir. My Lady has hit the Thing.</p>
                  <p>Very good, very good, by my Soul, ſays Lord <hi>Jackey,</hi> let my <hi>young Aunt,</hi> that was his Word, chuſe for you, Sir.</p>
                  <p>Well then, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid the dear Gentleman, give us <hi>your</hi> Opinion, as to this Point.</p>
                  <p>But, firſt, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> ſay you will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by it; or elſe ſhe will be laid under a Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                  <p>Well then, reply'd he, be it ſo. I will be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by your Opinion, my Dear: Give it me freely.</p>
                  <p>Lord <hi>Jackey</hi> rubb'd his Hands together, Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, charming, as I hope to live! By <hi>Jove,</hi> this is juſt as I wiſh'd!</p>
                  <p>Well, now, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid my Lady, ſpeak your true Heart without Diſguiſe: I charge you do.</p>
                  <p>Why then, Gentlemen and Ladies, ſaid I, if I muſt be ſo bold as to ſpeak on a Subject, upon which, on ſeveral Accounts, it would become me to be ſilent, I ſhould be <hi>againſt</hi> the Title; but perhaps
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0272600703:180"/>
my Reaſon is of too private a Nature, to weigh any thing; and if ſo, it would not become me to have any Choice at all.</p>
                  <p>They all called upon me for my Reaſon; and I ſaid, looking down, a little abaſh'd, It is this: Here my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has diſparag'd himſelf by diſtinguiſhing, as he has done, ſuch a low Body as I; and the World will be apt to ſay, he is ſeeking to repair <hi>one way</hi> the Honour he has loſt <hi>another</hi>; and then, perhaps, it will be attributed to <hi>my</hi> Pride and Ambition: Here, they will be apt to ſay, the proud Cottager will needs be a Lady, in Hopes to conceal her Deſcent; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, had I ſuch a vain Thought, it would be but make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the more remember'd againſt both my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and myſelf. And indeed, as to my own Part, added I, I take too much Pride in having been lifted up into this Diſtinction, for the Cauſes to which I owe it, your Brother's <hi>Bounty</hi> and <hi>Generoſity,</hi> than to be aſhamed of what I <hi>was:</hi> Only now-and-then I am concerned for his own ſake, leſt he ſhould be too much cenſur'd.—But this would not be prevented by the Title; but rather would be aggravated by it. —So I am humbly of Opinion againſt the Title.</p>
                  <p>The dear Gentleman had hardly Patience to hear me out, but came to me, and folding his Arms about me, ſaid, Juſt as I wiſh'd, have you anſwer'd, my beloved <hi>Pamela:</hi> I was never yet deceiv'd in you; no, not once.</p>
                  <p>My Lady Counteſs, my Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> my Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> ſaid the dear Gentleman, do we want any Titles, think you, to make us happy, but what we can confer upon ourſelves? And he preſs'd my Hand to his Lips, as he always honours me moſt in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and went to his Place, highly pleas'd; while his fine Manner drew Tears from my Eyes, and made his noble Siſter's and the Counteſs's gliſten too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0272600703:181"/>My Lady ſaid, Well, for my Part, thou art a ſtrange Girl! Where, as my Brother once ſaid <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>See</hi> Vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 40.</note>, gotteſt thou all this? Then, pleaſantly humourous, as if ſhe was angry, ſhe changed her Tone, What ſignify thy <hi>meek</hi> Words, and <hi>humble</hi> Speeches, when by thy <hi>Actions,</hi> as well as <hi>Sentiments,</hi> thou reflecteſt upon us all?— <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid ſhe, have leſs Merit, or take care to conceal it better: I ſhall otherwiſe have no more Patience with thee, than thy Monarch has juſt now ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs was pleaſed to ſay, You're a happy Couple indeed! and I muſt needs repeat to you, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> four Lines, that Sir <hi>William Davenant</hi> made upon a Lady, who could not poſſibly deſerve them ſo much as yours does:
<q>
                        <l>She ne'er ſaw Courts; but Courts could have outdone,</l>
                        <l>With untaught Looks, and an unpractis'd Heart:</l>
                        <l>Her Nets the moſt prepar'd could never ſhun;</l>
                        <l>For <hi>Nature</hi> ſpread them in the Scorn of <hi>Art.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, my dear Miſs, how lucky one ſometimes is, in having what one ſays well accepted! Ay, that is all in all. For the Reaſon for the Anſwer I gave was ſo obvious, that one in my Circumſtances could not miſs it. Yet what Compliments had I upon it! 'Tis a Sign they were prepared to think well of me; and that's my great Pleaſure and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Such ſort of Entertainment as this you are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from your Correſpondent. I cannot do better than I can; and it may appear ſuch a Mixture of Self-praiſe, Vanity and Impertinence, that I expect you will tell me freely, as ſoon as this comes to your Hand, whether it be tolerable to you. Yet I muſt write on, for my dear Father and Mother's ſake,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0272600703:182"/>
who require it of me, and are prepared to approve of every thing that comes from me, for no other Reaſon but that: And I think you ought to leave me to write to them only, as I cannot hope it will be entertaining to any body elſe, without expecting as much Partiality and Favour from others, as I have from my dear Parents. Mean time I conclude here my firſt Converſation-piece; and am, and will be,</p>

               <p>OUR Breakfaſt Converſation Yeſterday, (at which only Mrs. <hi>Worden,</hi> my Lady's Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and my <hi>Polly</hi> attended) was ſo whimſically particular, (tho' I doubt ſome of it, at leaſt, will appear too trifling) that I cannot help acquainting my dear Miſs <hi>Darnford</hi> with it, who is deſirous of knowing all that relates to Lady <hi>Davers</hi>'s Conduct towards me.</p>
               <p>You muſt know then, that I have the Honour to ſtand very high in the Graces of Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> who on every Occaſion is pleaſed to call me his <hi>good Siſter,</hi> his <hi>dear Siſter,</hi> and ſometimes his <hi>charming Siſter</hi>; and he tells me, he will not be out of my Company for an Hour together, while he ſtays here, if he can help it.</p>
               <p>My Lady ſeems to reliſh this very well in the main, tho' ſhe cannot quite ſo readily, yet, frame her Mouth to the Sound of the Word <hi>Siſter,</hi> as my Lord does; of which this that follows is one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0272600703:183"/>His Lordſhip had called me by that tender Name twice before, and ſaying, I will drink another Diſh, I think, my <hi>good Siſter</hi>; my Lady ſaid, Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has got a Word by the End, that you ſeem mighty fond of: I have taken Notice, that you have called <hi>Pamela, Siſter, Siſter, Siſter,</hi> no leſs than Three times in a Quarter of an Hour.</p>
               <p>My Lord looked a little ſerious: I ſhall one Day or other, ſaid he, be allow'd to chuſe my own Words and Phraſes, I hope: Your Siſter, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> added he, often queſtions whether I am at Age or not, tho' the Houſe of Peers made no Scruple of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me among them ſome Years ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid, ſeverely, but with a ſmiling Air, 'Tis well ſhe has ſuch a Gentleman as your Lordſhip for a Husband, whoſe affectionate Indulgence overlooks all her ſaucy Sallies. I am ſure, when you took her out of our Family into your own, we all thought ourſelves bound to pray for you.</p>
               <p>I thought this a great Trial of my Lady's Patience: But it was from Mr. <hi>B.</hi> And ſhe ſaid, with a half-pleaſant, half-ſerious Air, How now, Confidence! —None but my Brother could have ſaid this, whoſe violent Spirit was always much more intolerable than mine: But I can tell you, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I was always thought very good-humour'd, and obliging to every body, till your Impudence came from College, and from your Travels; and then, I own, your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking Ways made me now-and-then a little out of the Way.</p>
               <p>Well, well, Siſter, we'll have no more of this Subject; only let us ſee, that my Lord <hi>Davers</hi> wants not his proper Authority with you, altho' you uſed to keep me in Awe formerly.</p>
               <p>Keep you in Awe! —That nobody could ever do yet, Boy or Man. — But, my Lord, I beg your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; for this Brother will make Miſchief betwixt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0272600703:184"/>
us, if he can. — I only took Notice of the Word <hi>Siſter</hi> ſo often us'd, which looked more like Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than Affection.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> ſaid my Lord gravely, I have two Reaſons for uſing the Word ſo frequently.</p>
               <p>I'd be glad to hear them, ſaid the dear taunting Lady; for I don't doubt they're mighty good ones. What are they, my Lord?</p>
               <p>One is, Becauſe I love, and am fond of my new Relation: The other, That you are ſo ſparing of the Epithet, that I call her ſo for us both.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip ſays well, rejoin'd my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſmiling; and Lady <hi>Davers</hi> can give two Reaſons why ſhe does <hi>not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, ſaid my Lady, now we are in for't, let us hear <hi>your</hi> two Reaſons likewiſe: I doubt not they're wiſe ones too.</p>
               <p>If they are <hi>yours,</hi> Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> they muſt be ſo: One is, That every Condeſcenſion of a proud Lady, to ſpeak in her own Dialect, comes as hard and as difficult, as a Favour from the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to the petty Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi> The ſecond, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of your Sex, (excuſe me, my Lady Counteſs) who having once made Scruples, think it inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with themſelves to be over-haſty to alter their own Conduct, chuſing rather to perſiſt in an Error, than own it to be one.</p>
               <p>This proceeded from the dear Gentleman's Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to ſee me in the leaſt ſlighted by my Lady: And I ſaid to Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> to ſoften Matters, Never, my Lord, were Brother and Siſter ſo loving in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and yet ſo ſatirical upon each other in Jeſt, as my good Lady and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> But your Lordſhip knows their Way.</p>
               <p>My Lady frown'd at her Brother, but turn'd it off with an Air: I love the Miſtreſs of this Houſe, ſaid ſhe, very well; and am quite reconcil'd to her: But
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0272600703:185"/>
methinks there is ſuch a hiſſing Sound in the Word <hi>Siſter,</hi> that I cannot abide it. 'Tis a true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Word, and a Word I have not been uſed to, having never had a Siſ-ſ-ſ-ter before, as you know. Speaking the firſt Syllable of the Word with an emphatical Hiſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid, Obſerve you not, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> that you uſed a Word (to avoid that) which had twice the Hiſſing in it that <hi>Siſter</hi> had;—and that was, Miſ-ſ-ſ-treſs, with two other hiſſing Words to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it, of this-s-s Houſ-ſ-ſ-e: But what childiſh Follies does not Pride make one ſtoop to! Excuſe, my Lady, (to the Counteſs) ſuch poor low Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation as we are dwindled into.</p>
               <p>O! Sir, ſaid her Ladyſhip, the Converſation is very agreeable; and I think, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> you're fairly caught.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid my Lady, then help me, good <hi>Siſter,</hi> there's for you! to a little Sugar. Will that pleaſe you, Sir?</p>
               <p>I am always pleas'd, reply'd her Brother, ſmiling, when Lady <hi>Davers</hi> acts up to her own Character, and the good Senſe ſhe is Miſtreſs of.</p>
               <p>Ay, ay, return'd ſhe, my good Brother, like other wiſe Men, takes it for granted, that it is a Mark of good Senſe to approve of whatever <hi>he</hi> does.— And ſo, for this one Time, I am a very ſenſible body with him. — And I'll leave off, while I have his good Word. Only one thing I muſt ſay to you, my Dear, turning to me, That tho' I call you <hi>Pamela,</hi> and <hi>Pamela,</hi> as I pleaſe, I do aſſure you, I love you as well as if I called you <hi>Siſter, Siſter,</hi> as Lord <hi>Davers</hi> does, at every Word.</p>
               <p>Your Ladyſhip gives me great Pleaſure, ſaid I, in this kind Aſſurance; and I don't doubt but I ſhall have the Honour of being called by that tender Name, if I can be ſo happy as to deſerve it; and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0272600703:186"/>
I'll loſe no Opportunity that ſhall be afforded me, to ſhew how ſincerely I will endeavour to do ſo.</p>
               <p>She was pleaſed to riſe from her Seat: Give me a Kiſs, my dear Girl; you deſerve every thing: And permit me to ſay <hi>Pamela</hi> ſometimes, as the Word occurs; for I am not uſed to ſpeak in Print, and I will call you <hi>Siſter</hi> when I think of it, and love you as well as ever Siſter loved another.</p>
               <p>Theſe proud and paſſionate Folks, ſaid my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> how good they can be, when they reflect a little on what becomes their Characters!</p>
               <p>So then, ſaid my Lady, I am to have no Merit of my own, I ſee, do what I will. This is not quite ſo generous in my Brother.</p>
               <p>Why, you ſaucy Siſter, ſaid he, excuſe me, Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> what Merit <hi>would</hi> you have? Can People merit by doing their Duty? And is it ſo great a Praiſe that you think fit to own for a Siſter, ſo deſerving a Girl as this, whom I take Pride in calling my Wife?</p>
               <p>Thou art what thou always waſt, return'd my Lady; and were I in this my imputed Pride to want an Excuſe, I know not the Creature living that ought ſo ſoon to make one for me as you.</p>
               <p>I <hi>do</hi> excuſe you, ſaid he, for <hi>that</hi> very Reaſon, if you pleaſe: But it little becomes either your Pride, or mine, to do any thing that wants Excuſe.</p>
               <p>Mighty moral! mighty grave, truly! <hi>Pamela,</hi> Friend, Siſter,—there's for you! thou art a happy Girl to have made ſuch a Reformation in thy honeſt Man's way of <hi>Thinking</hi> as well as <hi>Acting.</hi> But now we are upon this Topick, and none but Friends about us, I am reſolved to be even with thee, Brother. <hi>Jackey,</hi> if you are not for another Diſh, I wiſh you'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw. <hi>Polly Barlow,</hi> we don't want you. <hi>Beck,</hi> you may ſtay. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> obey'd; and <hi>Polly</hi> went out: For you muſt know, Miſs, that my Lady <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> will have none of the Men-Fellows, as ſhe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0272600703:187"/>
calls them, to attend upon us at Tea. And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay but I think her intirely in the right, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſons that might be given.</p>
               <p>When they were withdrawn, my Lady repeated, Now we are upon this Topick of Reclaiming and Reformation, tell me, thou bold Wretch; for you know I have ſeen all your Rogueries in <hi>Pamela</hi>'s Papers; tell me, if ever Rake but thyſelf made ſuch an Attempt as thou didſt, on this dear good Girl, in Preſence of a virtuous Woman, as Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> always was noted to be? As to the other vile Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Jewkes,</hi> 'tis leſs Wonder, altho' in <hi>that</hi> thou hadſt the Impudence of <hi>him</hi> who ſet thee to Work: But to make thy Attempt before Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> and in ſpite of her Struggles and Reproaches, was the very Stretch of ſhameleſs Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>The dear Gentleman ſeemed a little diſconcerted, and ſaid, Surely, ſurely, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> this is going too far! Look at <hi>Pamela</hi>'s bluſhing Face, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt Eye, and wonder at yourſelf for this Queſtion as much as you do at me for the Actions you ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>The Counteſs ſaid to me, My dear Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> I wonder not at this ſweet Confuſion on ſo affecting a Queſtion; but, indeed, ſince it has come in ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, I muſt ſay, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that we have all, and my Daughters too, wonder'd at this, more than any Part of your Attempts; becauſe, Sir, we thought you one of the moſt civiliz'd Gentlemen in <hi>England,</hi> and that you could not but wiſh to have ſaved Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances a little.</p>
               <p>Tho' this, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is to <hi>you,</hi> my <hi>Pamela,</hi> the Renewal of Griefs; yet hold up your dear Face.— You may—the Triumph was yours—the Shame and the Bluſhes ought to be mine.—And I will humour my ſaucy Siſter in all ſhe would have me ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0272600703:188"/>Nay, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> you know the Queſtion; I cannot put it ſtronger.</p>
               <p>That's very true, reply'd he. — But what would you have me ſay? Do you expect I ſhould give you a <hi>Reaſon</hi> for an Attempt that appears to you ſo very ſhocking?</p>
               <p>Nay, Sir, ſaid the Counteſs, don't ſay <hi>Appears to Lady</hi> Davers; for (excuſe me) it will appear ſo to every one who hears of it.</p>
               <p>I think my Brother is too hardly uſed, ſaid Lord <hi>Davers:</hi> He has made all the Amends he could make; and <hi>you,</hi> my Siſter, who were the Perſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, forgive him now, I hope; don't you?</p>
               <p>I could not anſwer; for I was quite confounded; and made a Motion to withdraw: But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid, Don't go, my Dear: Tho' I ought to be aſham'd of an Action ſet before me in ſo full a Glare, in Preſence of Lord <hi>Davers</hi> and the Counteſs;—yet I will not have you ſtir, becauſe I forget how you repreſented it, and you muſt tell me.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Sir, I cannot, ſaid I: Pray, my dear Ladies, pray, my good Lord, and dear Sir, don't thus <hi>renew my Griefs,</hi> as you were pleaſed juſtly to phraſe it.</p>
               <p>I have the Repreſentation of that Scene in my Pocket, ſaid my Lady; for I was reſolved, as I told Lady <hi>Betty,</hi> to ſhame the wicked Wretch with it, the firſt Opportunity I had; and I'll read it to you; or, rather, you ſhall read it yourſelf, Boldface! if you can.</p>
               <p>So ſhe pulled thoſe Leaves out of her Pocket, wrapp'd up carefully in a Paper.—Here, I believe, he who could act thus, muſt read it; and, to ſpare <hi>Pamela</hi>'s Confuſion, read it to yourſelf; for we all know how it was.</p>
               <p>I think, ſaid he, taking the Papers, I can ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will abate the Heinouſneſs of this heavy
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0272600703:189"/>
Charge, or elſe I ſhould not ſtand thus at the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Bar of my Siſter, anſwering her Interrogatories.</p>
               <p>I ſend you, my dear Miſs, a Tranſcript of the Charge, as follows: — To be ſure, you'll ſay, he was a very wicked Gentleman.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> read this to himſelf, and ſaid, This is a dark Affair, as it is here ſtated; and I can't ſay, but <hi>Pamela,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> too, had a great deal of Reaſon to apprehend the worſt: But ſurely Readers of it, who were leſs Parties in the ſuppoſed Attempt, and who were not determined at all Events to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me, might have made a more favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for me, than you, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> have done, in the ſtrong Light in which you have ſet this heinous Matter before us.</p>
               <p>However, ſince my Lady Counteſs, and Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> ſeem to expect, that I ſhall particularly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this black Charge, I will, at a proper Time, if it will be agreeable, give you a brief Hiſtory of my Paſſion for this dear Girl, how it commenc'd, and increas'd, and my own Struggles with it: And this will introduce, with ſome little Advantage to myſelf perhaps, what I have to ſay, as to this ſuppoſed At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and at the ſame time inable you the better to account for ſome Facts which you have read in my pretty Accuſer's Papers.</p>
               <p>This pleaſed every one, and they begg'd him to begin <hi>then:</hi> But he ſaid, It was Time we ſhould think of Dreſſing, the Morning being far advanc'd; and if no Company came in, he would give them, in the Afternoon, the Particulars they deſired to hear.</p>
               <p>The three Gentlemen rode out, and returned juſt Time enough to dreſs before Dinner; and my Lady and the Counteſs alſo took an Airing in the Chariot. Juſt as they returned, Compliments came from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the neighbouring Ladies to our noble Gueſts,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0272600703:190"/>
on their Arrival in theſe Parts; and, to as many as ſent, Lady <hi>Davers</hi> deſir'd their Companies for To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow in the Afternoon, to drink Tea: But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> having fallen in with ſome of the Gentlemen like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he told me, we ſhould have moſt of our viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Neighbours at Dinner, and deſired Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> might prepare accordingly for them.</p>
               <p>After Dinner Mr. <hi>H.</hi> took a Ride out, attended with Mr. <hi>Colbrand,</hi> of whom he is very fond, ever ſince he frighten'd Lady <hi>Davers</hi>'s Footmen at the Hall, threatening <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Vol. II. <hi>p.</hi> 250.</note> to chine them, if they offer'd to ſtop his Lady; for, he ſays, he loves a Man of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; very probably knowing his own Defects that way; for my Lady now-and-then calls him a Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-hearted Fellow. And then Lord and Lady <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and the Counteſs, reviv'd the Subject of the Morning; and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was pleaſed to begin in the Manner I ſhall mention by-and-by.

               <p>Then ſhe muſt make a brighter Appearance by far, and a more pleaſing one too; for why? She has 3000 <hi>Satellites,</hi> or little Stars, in her Train more than poor <hi>Polly</hi> can pretend to. Won't there be fine Twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Sparkling, think you, when the Greater and Leſſer Bear-ſtars are joined together?</p>
               <p>But excuſe me, dear Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> this ſaucy Girl has vex'd me juſt now, by her ill-natur'd Tricks; and I am even with her, having thus vented my Spite, tho' ſhe knows nothing of the Matter.</p>
               <p>So, fanſy, my dear Friend, you ſee <hi>Polly Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> abandon'd by her own Fault; her Papa angry at her; her Mamma pitying her, and calling her ſilly Girl; Mr. <hi>Murray,</hi> who is a rough Lover, growling over his Miſtreſs, as a Dog over a Bone he fears to loſe; Miſs <hi>Nancy,</hi> putting on her prudiſh Pleaſantry, and ſnarling out a kind Word, and breaking thro' her ſullen Gloom, for a Smile now-and-then in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and I laughing at both in my Sleeve, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that in a while I ſhall get Leave to attend you in Town, and that will be better than twenty humble Servants of Mr. <hi>Murray</hi>'s Caſt: Or, if I can't, that I ſhall have the Pleaſure of your Correſpondence here, and injoy, unenvied, the Favour of my dear Papa and Mamma, which this ill temper'd Girl is always begrudging me.</p>

               <p>I AM retired from a very buſy Day, having had no leſs than Fourteen of our Neighbours, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Ladies, to Dinner with us: The Occaſion principally to welcome our noble Gueſts into theſe Parts; Mr. <hi>B.</hi> having, as I mentioned in a former, turn'd the intended Viſit into an Entertainment, after his uſual generous Manner.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Lord <hi>Davers</hi> are gone Part of the Way with them home; and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> or Lord <hi>Jackey,</hi> as we call the Gentleman, who will always be young, mounted, with his Favourite <hi>Colbrand,</hi> as an Eſcorte to the Counteſs and Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> who are gone to take an Airing in the Chariot. They offer'd to take the Coach, if I would have gone; but being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd, I deſir'd to be excus'd. So I retir'd to my
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0272600703:223"/>
Cloſet, and Miſs <hi>Darnford,</hi> who is ſeldom out of my Thoughts, coming into my Mind, I had a new Recruit of Spirits, which inabled me to reſume my Pen, and thus I proceed with my Journal:</p>
               <p>Our Company was, <note n="*" place="bottom">For the Characters of moſt of theſe Gentlemen and Ladies, ſee <hi>Vol. I.</hi> p. <hi>59, 85.</hi> and <hi>Vol. II.</hi> p. <hi>354</hi> to <hi>358,</hi> and <hi>376</hi> to <hi>380.</hi>
                  </note> the Earl and Counteſs of <hi>D.</hi> who are ſo faſhionable a marry'd Couple, that the Earl made it his Boaſt, and his Counteſs bore it like one accuſtomed to ſuch Treatment, that he had not been in his Lady's Company an Hour abroad before for ſeven Years. You know his Lordſhip's Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter: Every body does; and there is not a worſe, as Report ſays, in the Peerage.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Atkyns,</hi> a ſingle Gentleman, not a little finical and ceremonious, and a mighty Beau, tho' of the tawdry Sort, and affecting foreign Airs, as if he was afraid it would not be judg'd by any other Mark, that he had travelled.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Arthur,</hi> and his Lady, a moderately happy Couple, who ſeem always when together to behave as if they were upon a Compromiſe; that is, that each would take it in Turn to ſay free Things of the other — tho' ſome of their Freedoms are of ſo cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Nature, that it looks as if they intended to divert the Company at their own Expence. The Lady, being of a noble Family, takes great Pains to let every one know, that ſhe values herſelf not a little upon that Advantage: But otherwiſe has many good Qualities.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Brooks,</hi> and his Lady, a Gentleman who is a free Joker on ſerious Subjects, but a good-natur'd Man, and ſays ſprightly things with no ill Grace; but his Lady is a little reſerved, and of a haughty Turn, tho' To-day ſhe happened to be freer than uſual; as was observed at Table by</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0272600703:224"/>Lady <hi>Towers,</hi> who is a Maiden Lady of Family, noted for her Wit and Repartee, and who ſays many good Things, with ſo little Doubt, and really ſo good a Grace, that one cannot help being pleas'd with her. This Lady is generally gallanted by</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> of the Grove, as he is called, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh him from a rich Citizen of that Name, who is ſettled in theſe Parts, but being covetous and proud, is ſeldom admitted among the Gentry in their Viſits or Parties of Pleaſure. Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> is a ſhrewd Gentleman, but has been a little too much of the Libertine Caſt, and has lived freely as to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and for that Reaſon has not been received by Mrs. <hi>Towers,</hi> who hates free Actions, tho' ſhe'll uſe free Words, modeſtly free, as ſhe calls them, that is to ſay, the Double Entendre, in which Sir <hi>Simon Darnford,</hi> a Gentleman you are not unacquainted with, takes great Delight; tho', by the way, what that worthy Gentleman calls innocent, Lady <hi>Towers</hi> would bluſh at.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dormer,</hi> a Gentleman of a very courteous Demeanour, a Widower, was another, who always ſpeaks well of his deceaſed Lady, and of all the Sex for her ſake.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Chapman,</hi> and his Lady, a well-behav'd Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are not aſhamed to be very tender and obſerving to one another, but without that cenſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fondneſs which ſits ſo ill upon ſome married Folks in Company.</p>
               <p>Then there was the <hi>Dean,</hi> our good Miniſter, whom I name laſt, becauſe I would cloſe with one of the worthieſt; and his <hi>Daughter,</hi> who came to ſupply her Mamma's Place, who was indiſpos'd; a well-behav'd prudent young Lady. And here were our Fourteen Gueſts.</p>
               <p>The Counteſs of <hi>C.</hi> Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and your humble Servant,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0272600703:225"/>
made up the reſt of the Company. So we had a capacious and brilliant Circle, you may imagine; and all the Avenues to the Houſe were crouded with their Equipages.</p>
               <p>The Subjects of Diſcourſe at Dinner were vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as you may well ſuppoſe, and the Circle was too large to fall upon any regular or very remarkable Topicks. A good deal of ſprightly Wit, however, flew about, between the Earl of <hi>D.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Towers</hi> and Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> in which that Lord ſuffered as he deſerved; for he was by no means a Match for the Lady, eſpecially as the Preſence of the Dean was a Reſtraint, as was very viſible, upon him, and Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> too: So much Awe will the Character of a good Clergyman always impreſs upon even forward Spirits, where he is known to have had an inviolable Regard to it himſelf.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the good Gentleman has a genteel and in-offenſive Vein of Raillery himſelf, and ſo was too hard for them at their own Weapons.</p>
               <p>But after Dinner was over, and the Servants were withdrawn, Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> began to ſingle me out, as he loves to do, for a Subject of Encomium, and made ſome high Compliments to my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> on his Choice; and wiſhed (as he often does) he could find juſt ſuch another Perſon for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Lady <hi>Towers</hi> told him, That it was a Thing as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable as it was unreaſonable, that every Rake who loved to deſtroy Virtue, ſhould expect to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with it: And if his <hi>Brother B.</hi> had come off ſo well, ſhe thought no one elſe ought to expect it.</p>
               <p>Lady <hi>Davers</hi> ſaid, It was a very juſt Obſervation; and ſhe thought 'twas pity there was not a Law, that every Man who made a Harlot of an honeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhould be obliged to marry one of another's making.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0272600703:226"/>That would be too ſevere, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid; it would be Puniſhment enough, if he was to marry his own; and eſpecially if he had not ſeduced her under Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Marriage.</p>
               <p>Then you'd have a Man be obliged, reply'd Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> to ſtand to his Promiſe, I ſuppoſe, Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes, Madam.</p>
               <p>But, ſaid ſhe, the Proof would be difficult perhaps, and the moſt unguilty Heart of our Sex, might be leaſt able to make it out. But what ſay you, my Lord <hi>D.</hi> continued Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> will you, and my Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> join to bring in a Bill into the Houſe of Peers, for the Purpoſes I mentioned? I fanſy my Brother would give it all the Aſſiſtance he could in the Lower Houſe.</p>
               <p>Your Ladyſhip, ſaid Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> is highly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, I think, to propoſe that: It would be enough, ſurely, that a Man ſhould be obliged, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſays, to marry the Woman he himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p>The Earl ſaid, That he thought neither the one nor the other ſhould be impoſed upon any Man; for that when Womens Virtue was their Glory, and they were brought up with that Notion, and to avoid the Snares of Men, he thought, if they yielded, they ought to pay the Forfeit, and take the Diſgrace of it to themſelves.</p>
               <p>May I ask your Lordſhip, ſaid I, How it comes to paſs, that a Woman's Virtue is her Glory, and that a Man's ſhall not be his?—Or, in other Words, Why you think Virtue in a Man is not as requiſite as in a Woman?</p>
               <p>Cuſtom, Madam, reply'd the Earl, has made it very different; and thoſe Things which are ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in a Lady, are not ſo in a Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Will your Lordſhip argue, that it ſhould be ſo, becauſe it is ſo? Does not the Gentleman call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0272600703:227"/>
the Head of his Family? Is it not incumbent upon him then to ſet a good Example? And will he plead it as a Faſhion, that he may do by the deareſt Relatives of another Man's Family, what, if any one ſhould attempt to do by his, he would mortally reſent?</p>
               <p>Very well obſerved, Madam, ſaid the Dean: There is not a Free-liver in the World, I believe, that can anſwer that Argument.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid the Earl, pray ſpeak to your Lady: She is too cloſe upon <hi>us.</hi> And where Sentiments have been ſo well ſupported by a Conduct ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and exemplary, I chuſe not to enter the Liſts with ſuch an Antagoniſt.</p>
               <p>Well, well, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſince your Lordſhip will ſpeak in the Plural Number U S, let me ſay, We muſt not pretend to hold an Argument on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.—But, however, I think, my Lord, you ſhould not call upon a Man to defend it, who, bad as he has been, never committed a Fault of this Nature, that he was not ſorry for, tho' the Sorrow generally laſted too little a while.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> (ſaid Lady <hi>Towers</hi>) has ſome Merit with me for that Anſwer: And he has ſtill a greater on another Account; and that is, that he has ſeen his Error ſo early, and has left his Vices before they have left him.</p>
               <p>She looked, as every one did, on the Earl, who appeared a little diſconcerted, as one conſcious, that he deſerved the Reflection. And the Dean ſaid, Lady <hi>Towers</hi> obſerves very well: For, altho' I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not to make perſonal Applications, yet I muſt ſay, That the Gentleman who ſees his Error in the Prime of Life, before he is overtaken by ſome awakening Misfortune, may be called one of the happieſt of thoſe who have erred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0272600703:228"/>Ay, Mr. Dean, ſaid Lady <hi>Towers,</hi> I can tell you one thing, that ſuch another Buttreſs as you know who, taken away from Libertiniſm, and ſuch another Example as a certain Lady every Day gives, would go near in a few Years to ruin the Devil's Kingdom in <hi>Bedfordſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gentlemen looked round upon one another upon this home Puſh: And the Lady would not let them recover it. See, ſaid ſhe, how the Gentlemen look upon one another, as who ſhould ſay, each to his Companion, I'm not ſo bad as you!</p>
               <p>Ay, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> I ſee, my Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>D.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> look moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>Faith, Ladies, ſaid Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> this is too ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſonal: A Man who contends with a Lady has a fine Time of it; for we are under Reſtraint, while you ſay any thing you pleaſe. But let me tell you, there's not a Man of us all, 'tis my Opinion, that could have attempted what a certain Renegado has attempted, tho' he is ſo readily acquitted.</p>
               <p>Not ſo haſty, my good Friend, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> You don't conſider well what you ſay, nor of whom: For did <hi>I</hi> take upon myſelf to cenſure <hi>you?</hi> But tho' I may challenge you to ſay the worſt you can, becauſe I always dealt upon my own Stock, while other People I could name enter'd into a Society and club<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for Miſchief; yet I ſee you deal with a Brother Rake, when he reforms, as Highwaymen with one of their Gang, who would fain withdraw and be honeſt, but is kept among them by Fear of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment.</p>
               <p>But is not this, Ladies, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Arthur,</hi> a ſad thing, that ſo many fine Gentlemen as think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concern'd in this Charge, ſhould have no way to clear themſelves but by Recrimination?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0272600703:229"/>Egad, ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Atkyns,</hi> I know not what you're about, Gentlemen! You make but ſorry Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, by my Faith! — I have heard of many <hi>queer</hi> Pranks among my <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi> Neighbours; but I bleſs my Stars, I was in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> all the Time.</p>
               <p>Said Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Arthur</hi> ſpoke the Words <hi>fine Gentlemen,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> thought himſelf obliged to enter upon his own Defence.</p>
               <p>Ay, ſaid the Earl; and the beſt of it is, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> pleads not his <hi>Virtue</hi> neither, that he did not join his <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi> Neighbours, but his <hi>Abſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gad take me, returned he, putting a Pinch of Snuff to his Noſe with an Air, you're plaguy ſharp, Gentlemen: I believe in my Conſcience you're in a Confederacy, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſays, and would ſwear an honeſt Man into the Plot, that would not care for ſuch Company. What ſay you, Mr. <hi>H.?</hi> which Side are you of?</p>
               <p>The Gallows, reply'd he, in his uſual blunt Way, are of the Ladies Side; and I was always of the Side of the Gallows.</p>
               <p>That ſhews, return'd Lady <hi>Towers,</hi> that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is more afraid of the <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> than of <hi>deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it.</p>
               <p>'Tis well, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that any Conſideration de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a Gentleman at Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Time of Life. What may be <hi>Fear</hi> now, may improve to <hi>Virtue</hi> by-and-by.</p>
               <p>Ay, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers, Jackey</hi> is one of his Uncle's <hi>Foxes.</hi> He'd be glad to ſnap up a ſtraggling Pullet, if he was not well look'd after, perhaps.</p>
               <p>Pray, my Dear, ſaid Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> forbear: You ought not to introduce two different Converſations in different Companies.</p>
               <p>I think, truly, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> you ſhould take the Dean's Hint, my good Friends; elſe you'll be leſs <hi>polite</hi> than <hi>perſonal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0272600703:230"/>Well, but, Gentlemen, ſaid Lady <hi>Arthur,</hi> ſince you ſeem to have been ſo hard put to it, as <hi>ſingle</hi> Gentlemen, what's to be done with the marry'd Man who ruins an innocent body? What Puniſhment, Mrs. <hi>Towers,</hi> ſhall we find out for ſuch? and what Reparation to the Injured? This, it ſeems, was ſaid with a particular View to the Earl, on a late ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Occaſion: But I knew it not till afterwards.</p>
               <p>As to the Puniſhment of the Gentleman, reply'd Mrs. <hi>Towers,</hi> where the Law has not provided for it, it muſt be left, I believe, to his Conſcience. It will then one Day be heavy enough. But as to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to the Woman, ſo far as it can be made, it will be determinable as the unhappy Perſon <hi>may</hi> or may <hi>not</hi> know, that her Seducer is a marry'd Man: If ſhe knows he is, I think <hi>ſhe</hi> neither deſerves Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs nor Pity, tho' it alleviates not <hi>his</hi> Guilt. But if the Caſe be otherwiſe, and <hi>ſhe</hi> had no means of informing herſelf that he was marry'd, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to make her his Wife, to be ſure, tho' <hi>ſhe</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be acquitted, <hi>he</hi> deſerves the ſevereſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can be inflicted. What ſay you, Mrs. <hi>B.?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I muſt ſpeak my Mind, reply'd I, I think, that ſince Cuſtom, as the Earl ſaid juſt now, exacts ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Regard to Virtue from Men, and ſo much from Women, and ſince the Deſigns of the former upon the latter are ſo flagrantly avow'd and known, the poor Creature, who ſuffers herſelf to be ſeduced either by a <hi>ſingle</hi> or <hi>marry'd</hi> Man, <hi>with</hi> Promiſes, or <hi>without,</hi> has nothing to do, but to ſequeſter herſelf from the World, and dedicate the Remainder of her Days to Penitence and Obſcurity. As to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, added I, he muſt be left, I doubt, to his Conſcience, as you ſay, Mrs. <hi>Towers,</hi> which will, ſooner than he wiſhes, find him out.</p>
               <p>Every young Lady has not your angelick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Dormer.</hi> And there are
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0272600703:231"/>
Caſes in which the Fair Sex deſerve Compaſſion, ours Execration. Love may inſenſibly ſteal upon a ſoft Heart: When once admitted, the Oaths, Vows, and Proteſtations of the favour'd Object, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, on all Occaſions, declaims againſt the Deceivers of his Sex, confirm her good Opinion of him, till, having lull'd aſleep her Vigilance, in an unguarded Hour he takes Advantage of her unſuſpecting Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Is not ſuch a poor Creature to be pity'd! And what Puniſhment does not ſuch a Seducer deſerve?</p>
               <p>You have put, Sir, ſaid I, a moving Caſe, and in a generous Manner. What, indeed, does not ſuch a Deceiver deſerve?</p>
               <p>And the more, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Chapman,</hi> as the moſt innocent Heart is generally the moſt credulous.</p>
               <p>Very true, ſaid my Counteſs; for ſuch an one as would do no Harm <hi>to</hi> others, ſeldom ſuſpects any <hi>from</hi> others! And her Lot is very unequally caſt; admir'd for that very Innocence, which tempts ſome brutal Ravager to ruin it.</p>
               <p>Yet, What is that Virtue, ſaid the Dean, which cannot ſtand the Teſt?</p>
               <p>But, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Towers,</hi> very ſatirically, Whither, Ladies, are we got? We are upon the Subject of Virtue and Honour. Let us talk of ſomething, in which the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> can join with us. This is ſuch an one, you ſee, that none but the Dean and Mr. <hi>Dormer</hi> can diſcourſe upon.</p>
               <p>Let us then, ſaid Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> to be even with <hi>one</hi> Lady at leaſt, find a Subject that will be <hi>new</hi> to her. And that is CHARITY.</p>
               <p>Does what I ſaid concern Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> more than any other Gentleman, retorted Mrs. <hi>Towers,</hi> that he is diſpoſed to take Offence at it?</p>
               <p>I think, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> pardon me, Mrs. <hi>Towers,</hi> a Lady ſhould never make a Motion to wave ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0272600703:232"/>
as thoſe of Virtue and Honour; and leſs ſtill in Company, where there is ſo much Occaſion, as ſhe ſeems to think, for inforcing them.</p>
               <p>Nay, ſaid ſhe, I deſire not to wave the Subject, I'll aſſure you. And if you think, Sir, it may do good, we will continue it, for the ſakes of all <hi>you,</hi> Gentlemen, (looking round her archly) who are of Opinion, you may be benefited by it.</p>
               <p>We are going into Perſonals again, Gentlemen and Ladies, ſaid the Earl.</p>
               <p>And that won't bear, my Lord, you ſeem to think? retorted Lady <hi>Davers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Toaſt to the King and Royal Family brought on Publick Affairs, and Politicks; and the Ladies withdrawing to Coffee and Tea, I have no more to ſay as to this Converſation, having repeated all that I remember was ſaid to any Purpoſe; for ſuch large Companies, you know, Miſs, don't always produce the moſt agreeable and edifying Subjects. But this I was the willinger to recite, becauſe I thought the Characters of ſome of our Neighbours would be thereby made more familiar to you, if ever I ſhould have the Happineſs to ſee you in theſe Parts.</p>
               <p>I will only add, that Miſs <hi>L.</hi> the Dean's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is a very modeſt and agreeable young Lady, and a perfect Miſtreſs of Muſick; in which the Dean takes great Delight alſo, and is a fine Judge of it. The Gentlemen coming in, to partake of our Coffee and Converſation, as they ſaid, obtain'd of Miſs to play ſeveral Tunes on the Spinnet; and would have me do ſo too. But really, Miſs <hi>L.</hi> ſo very much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd me, that had I regarded my Reputation for play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above the Deſire I had (as I ſaid, and truly ſaid) to oblige the good Company, I ought not to have pretended to touch a Key after ſuch a Miſtreſs of it. Miſs has no Voice, which is great Pity; and at her Requeſt, and the Dean's, and the Company, I ſung to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0272600703:233"/>
her Play, twice or thrice; as did Mrs. <hi>Towers,</hi> whoſe Voice exceeds her Ear. But here, Miſs, will I end my Fourth Converſation-Piece.</p>

                  <head>SATURDAY <hi>Morning.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Counteſs being a little indiſpos'd, Lady <hi>Davers</hi> and I took an Airing this Morning in the Chariot, and had a great deal of Diſcourſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Her Ladyſhip was pleaſed to expreſs great Favour and Tenderneſs for me; gave me a great deal of good Advice as to the Care ſhe would have me take of myſelf, and told me, that her Hopes, as well as her Brother's, all centred in my Welfare; and that the Way I was in, made her love me better and better.</p>
                  <p>She was pleaſed to tell me, how much ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of the domeſtick Management; and to ſay, that ſhe never ſaw ſuch Regularity and Method in any Family in her Life, where was the like Number of Servants: Every one, ſhe ſaid, knew their Duty, and did it without Speaking to, in ſuch Silence, and with ſo much apparent Chearfulneſs and Delight, without, the leaſt Hurry or Confuſion, that it was her Surprize and Admiration. But kindly would have it, that I took too much upon me: Yet, ſaid ſhe, I don't ſee, but you are always freſh and lively, and never ſeem tir'd or fatigu'd; and are always dreſs'd and eaſy, ſo that no Company find you unprepar'd, or unfit to receive them, come when they will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to Breakfaſt or Dinner.</p>
                  <p>I told her Ladyſhip, I owed all this, and moſt of the Conduct for which ſhe was pleaſed to praiſe me, to her dear Brother, who at the Beginning of my
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0272600703:234"/>
Happineſs, gave me ſeveral Cautions <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>See</hi> Vol. II. p. 207.</note> and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for my Behaviour; which had always been the Rule of my Conduct ever ſince, and I hoped ever would be: To ſay nothing, added I, which would be very unjuſt, of the Help I receive from worthy Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> who is an excellent Manager.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Good Creature, ſweet Pamela,</hi> and <hi>charming Girl,</hi> were her common Words, and ſhe was pleaſed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to me ſuch a graceful and unaffected Eaſe, and would have it, that I have a natural Dignity in my Perſon and Behaviour, which command Love and Reverence at the ſame time; inſomuch that, my dear Miſs, I am in Danger of being as proud as any thing. For you muſt believe, that her Ladyſhip's Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation gives me great Pleaſure; and the more, as I was afraid, before ſhe came, I ſhould not have come off near ſo well in her Opinion.</p>
                  <p>As the Chariot paſſed along, ſhe took great No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Reſpects paid me by People of different Ranks, and of the Bleſſings beſtowed upon me, by ſeveral, as we proceeded; and ſaid, She ſhould fare well, and be rich in good Wiſhes for being in my Company.</p>
                  <p>The good People, who know us, <hi>will</hi> do ſo, Madam, ſaid I; but I had rather have their ſilent Prayers, than their audible ones; and I have cauſed ſome of them to be told ſo; but they ſay, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it: And one honeſt Man ſaid, That every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body's Hearts ſprang to their Lips as ſoon as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and they could not keep their Words in.</p>
                  <p>What I apprehend, Madam, continued I, is, that you will be more uneaſy To-morrow, when at Church you'll ſee a good many People in the ſame way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indeed, added I, my Story, and your dear Brother's Tenderneſs to me, are ſo much talked of, that many
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0272600703:235"/>
Strangers are brought thither to ſee us. 'Tis the only thing, ſaid I, (and ſo it is, Miſs) that makes me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to go to <hi>London;</hi> for by the Time we return, the Novelty, I hope, will ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Then I mention'd ſome Verſes of Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> which had been laid under the Cuſhions in our Seat at Church, two <hi>Sundays</hi> ago, by ſome unknown Hand; and how uneaſy they have made me. I will tranſcribe them, Miſs, and give you the Particulars of our Converſation on that Occaſion. The Verſes are theſe:
<q>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Thou robb'ſt my Days of Bus'neſs and Delights,</l>
                           <l>Of Sleep thou robb'ſt my Nights.</l>
                           <l>Ah! lovely Thief! what wilt thou do?</l>
                           <l>What! rob me of Heav'n too!</l>
                           <l>Thou ev'n my Pray'rs doſt ſteal from me,</l>
                           <l>And I with wild Idolatry,</l>
                           <l>Begin to God, and end them all to thee.</l>
                        </lg>
                        <lg>
                           <l>No, to what Purpoſe ſhould I ſpeak?</l>
                           <l>No, wretched Heart, ſwell till you break:</l>
                           <l>She cannot love me, if ſhe would;</l>
                           <l>And, to ſay Truth, 'twere pity that ſhe ſhould.</l>
                           <l>No, to the Grave thy Sorrows bear,</l>
                           <l>As ſilent as they will be there:</l>
                           <l>Since that lov'd Hand this mortal Wound does give,</l>
                           <l>So handſomely the Thing contrive,</l>
                           <l>That ſhe may guiltleſs of it live:</l>
                           <l>So periſh, that her killing thee</l>
                           <l>May a Chance-medley, and no Murder be!</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I had them in my Pocket, and read them to my Lady; who ask'd me, If her Brother had ſeen them? I told her, It was he that found them under the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion I uſed to ſit upon; but did not ſhew them to me, till I came home; and that I was ſo vexed at them, that I could not go to Church in the Afternoon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0272600703:236"/>What ſhould you be vex'd at, my Dear? ſaid ſhe: How could you help it?—My Brother was not diſturb'd at them, was he?</p>
                  <p>No, indeed, ſaid I: He chid <hi>me</hi> for being ſo; and was pleaſed to make me a fine Compliment upon it; that he did not wonder, that every body who ſaw me, lov'd me.—But I ſaid, This was all wicked Wit was good for, to inſpire ſuch Boldneſs in bad Hearts, which might otherwiſe not dare to ſet Pen to Paper to affront any one.</p>
                  <p>But pray, Madam, added I, don't own I have told you of them, leſt there ſhould be a Poſſibility for a Shadow of a Thought, that I was prompted by ſome vile, ſecret Vanity in being admir'd, to tell your Ladyſhip of them: When, I am ſure, they have vex'd me more than enough. For is it not a ſad Thing, that the Church ſhould be profan'd by ſuch Actions, and ſuch Thoughts, as ought not to be brought into it?</p>
                  <p>Then, Madam, to have any wicked Man <hi>dare</hi> to think of one with impure Notions! It gives me the leſs Opinion of myſelf, that I ſhould be ſo much as <hi>thought of</hi> as the Object of any wicked Body's Wiſhes. I have called myſelf to Account upon it, whether any Levity in my Looks, my Dreſs, my Appearance, could imbolden ſuch an affrontive Inſolence. And I have thought upon this Occaſion better of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s Delicacy, than I did, when I read of it; who, upon an Attempt made on his Wife, to which, however, it does not appear ſhe gave the leaſt Incouragement, ſaid, to thoſe who pleaded for her againſt the Divorce he was reſolved upon, <hi>That the Wife of</hi> Caeſar <hi>ought not to be ſuſpected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed, Madam, continued I, it would extremely ſhock me, but to know, that any wicked Heart had conceived a Deſign upon me; Upon <hi>me,</hi> give me Leave to repeat, whoſe only Glory and Merit is, that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0272600703:237"/>
I have had the Grace to withſtand the greateſt of Trials and Temptations, from a Gentleman more worthy to be beloved both for Perſon and Mind, than any Man in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Obſervation, my Dear, is truly delicate, and ſuch as becomes your Mind and Character. And I really think, if any Lady in the World is ſecure from vile Attempts, it muſt be you; not only from your Story ſo well known, and the Love you bear to your Man, and his Merit to you, but from the Prudence, and natural <hi>Dignity,</hi> I will ſay, of your Behaviour, which, tho' all graceful Eaſe and Chearfulneſs, is what would ſtrike dead the Hope of any preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Libertine, the Moment he ſees you.</p>
                  <p>How can I enough, return'd I, and kiſſed her Hand, acknowlege your Ladyſhip's polite Goodneſs in this Compliment! But, my Lady, you ſee by the very Inſtance I have mention'd, that a Liberty <hi>is</hi> taken, which I cannot think of without Pain.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſuch a Liberty, reply'd my Lady, as ſhews more Deſpair than Hope, and is a Confirmation of my Sentiments on the Prudence and Dignity which not only I, but every body attributes to you.</p>
                  <p>Kind, kind, Lady <hi>Davers!</hi> ſaid I, again preſſing her Hand with my Lips. But I will turn my Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, ſince I know not, and hope I never ſhall, the vile Tranſcriber, upon the Author of the Verſes, I think; for had they not been written, I ſhould not have been thus inſulted, perhaps.</p>
                  <p>But, reply'd my Lady, <hi>Cowley</hi> is my favourite Poet. He has a beautiful Imagination, a vaſt deal of brilliant Wit, and a Chaſtity too in his Works, that hardly any of the Tribe can boaſt.</p>
                  <p>I once liked him better too, ſaid I, than I have done ſince this; for he was one of the Poets that my Lady would permit me to read ſometimes; and his Pieces in Praiſe of the Country Life, and thoſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0272600703:238"/>
charming Lines againſt Ambition, uſed to delight me much:
<q>
                        <l>If e'er Ambition ſhould my Fancy cheat</l>
                        <l>With any Wiſh ſo <hi>mean,</hi> as to be great,</l>
                        <l>Continue, Heav'n, ſtill from me to remove</l>
                        <l>The humble Bleſſings of the Life I love!</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have taken Notice of theſe Lines often, ſaid my Lady, and been pleas'd with them. But I think you have no Reaſon to be out of Conceit with <hi>Cowley,</hi> for the ill Uſe made of his Verſes. He but too na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deſcribes the Influence of Love; which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently interferes with our better Duties. And there is ſomething very natural, and eaſy, and witty, in the firſt Lines:— And ſhews that the Poet <hi>laments</hi> the too ingaging Impreſſions which Love made upon his Mind, even on the moſt ſolemn Occaſions—<hi>What! rob me of Heav'n too!</hi>—A bad Heart, <hi>Pamela,</hi> could not have ſo lamented, or ſo written!</p>
                  <p>Ah! but, Madam, ſaid I, I have ſeen, in your dear Brother's Collection of Manuſcripts, a Poem in which this very Point, nice as it is, is touched with much greater Propriety.</p>
                  <p>Can you repeat it, my Dear?</p>
                  <p>The Lines I <hi>mean,</hi> I can. Your Ladyſhip muſt know, It was upon a Quarrel between a beloved Couple, where the Gentleman had been wild, and the Lady's ill-natur'd Uncle, who wanted to break the Match, (tho' it was deſigned by her deceaſed Parents) had fomented it, ſo that ſhe would not look upon her Lover, nor ſee him, nor receive a Letter of Excuſe from him, tho' they were betroth'd, and ſhe lov'd him dearly. This oblig'd him to throw himſelf in her Way at Church, and thus he writes:
<q>
                        <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0272600703:239"/>
                        <l>But, O! forgive me, Heav'n, if oft my Fair</l>
                        <l>Robs thee of my Devoir, diſturbs my Pray'r,</l>
                        <l>Confounds my beſt Reſolves, and makes me prove,</l>
                        <l>That ſhe's too much a Rival in thy Love!</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe now, Madam, continued I, are the Lines I admire:
<q>
                        <l>But <hi>better</hi> Thoughts my happier Hopes ſuggeſt,</l>
                        <l>When once this ſtormy Doubt's expell'd my Breaſt;</l>
                        <l>When once this <hi>agitated Flame</hi> ſhall turn</l>
                        <l>To <hi>ſteadier</hi> Heat, and more <hi>intenſely</hi> burn,</l>
                        <l>My dear <hi>MARIA</hi> then, thought I, will join,</l>
                        <l>And we, <hi>one Heart, one Soul,</hi> ſhall <hi>all</hi> be <hi>THINE!</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ay, <hi>Pamela,</hi> theſe are very pretty Lines. You muſt procure me a Sight of the Whole. They muſt needs let me into an entertaining Hiſtory of a Love Quarrel.—Mean time, you muſt not think ill of my Favourite <hi>Cowley</hi>; for I ſay, with a Gentleman, whoſe Judgment, and good Heart, have hardly any Equal, That tho' <hi>Cowley</hi> was going out of Faſhion with ſome, yet he ſhould always ſuſpect the Head or the Heart of him or her, who could not taſte, and delight in, his Beauties.</p>
                  <p>The Words,
<q>
                        <l>She <hi>cannot</hi> love me, if ſhe would,</l>
                        <l>And, <hi>to ſay</hi> Truth, 'twere pity that ſhe ſhould;</l>
                     </q>
Shew the Goodneſs of the Poet's Heart; and even, that the Tranſcriber, be he who he will, had not the <hi>worſt,</hi> that he could ſingle out <hi>theſe</hi>; when, if he would be ſhining with borrow'd Rays, he might have choſen a much worſe Poet to follow.</p>
                  <p>Oh! Madam, reply'd I, ſay not one Word in behalf of the wicked Tranſcriber. For a Wretch to entertain the Shadow of a Wiſh for a marry'd
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0272600703:240"/>
Perſon, is a Degree of Impurity that ought not to be excus'd: But to commit ſuch Thoughts to Writing, to put that Writing under the Seat of the marry'd Perſon at Church, when her Heart ſhould be ingag'd <hi>wholly</hi> in her firſt Duties; where too it might be more likely to be ſeen by the Pew-keepers than her, and ſo ſpread over the whole Pariſh, to the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bad Ideas, whenever I appeared; and, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, might come to the Hands of one's Husband, who from his own free Life formerly, and high Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as far as the Tranſcriber knew, might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy at, and angry with, the innocent Occaſion of the Inſult—Beſides the Apprehenſion it muſt give one, that the Man who could take this vile Step, might proceed to greater Lengths, which my buſy Fears could improve to Duelling and Murder—Then the Concern it muſt fill me with, to the diverting of my Mind from my firſt Regards, when <hi>any one</hi> looked at me wiſtfully, that <hi>he</hi> might be the Tranſcriber, which muſt always give me Confuſion of Thought: —Deareſt Madam, can one forbear being vex'd, when all theſe Imaginations dart in upon a Mind ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive as mine? Indeed this Action has given me great Uneaſineſs at times ever ſince, and I cannot help it.</p>
                  <p>I am pleas'd with your Delicacy, my Dear, as I ſaid before. — You can never err, while thus watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over your Conduct; — and I own, you have the more Reaſon for it, as you have marry'd a mere <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> an open-ey'd Rake, that was her Word, who would, on the leaſt Surmizes, tho' ever ſo cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs on your Part, have all his Paſſions up in Arms, in Apprehenſion of Liberties that might be offer'd like thoſe he has not ſcrupled to take.</p>
                  <p>Oh! but, Madam, ſaid I, your dear Brother has given me great Satisfaction in one Point; for you muſt think, I ſhould not love him as I ought, if I
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0272600703:241"/>
had not a Concern for his future Happineſs, as well as his preſent; and that is, he has aſſured me, that in all the Liberties he has taken, he never attempted a marry'd Lady, but always abhorred the Thought of ſo great an Evil.</p>
                  <p>'Tis pity, ſaid her Ladyſhip, that a Man who could conquer his Paſſions <hi>ſo far,</hi> could not ſubdue them intirely. This ſhews it was in his own Power to do ſo; and increaſes his Crime: And what a Wretch is he, who ſcrupling, under Pretence of Conſcience or Honour, to attempt Ladies <hi>within</hi> the Pale, boggles not to ruin a poor Creature <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>; although he knows, he thereby, moſt probably, for ever, deprives her of that Protection, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting her Marriage, which, even among ſuch Rakes as himſelf, is deemed inviolable, and ſo caſts the poor Creature headlong into the Jaws of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</p>
                  <p>Ah! Madam, reply'd I, this was the very Inference I made upon the Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>And what could he ſay?</p>
                  <p>He ſaid, my Inference was juſt; but call'd me <hi>pretty Preacher</hi>;—and once having caution'd me <note n="*" place="bottom">

<q>
                        <l>Since that lov'd Hand this mortal Wound does give,</l>

Is rather a <hi>Conceit,</hi> or <hi>Prettineſs,</hi> that won't bear Examination, than that true Wit in which this fine Poet excels:—For, if ſhe cannot love him <hi>if ſhe

would,</hi> and if it were <hi>pity</hi> that ſhe <hi>ſhould</hi> love him; this implies ſhe was a Lady under previous Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether Marriage or Betrothment is the ſame thing to him: Then, need the Thing to be ſo <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely contrived,</hi> need any Pains be taken, (if her Repulſe <hi>had killed,</hi> as Poetical Licence makes him ſay, this Invader of another's Right) to bring it in <hi>Chance-medley</hi>;—ſince no Jury could have brought it in <hi>Murder,</hi> except that Sort of Murder which is called <hi>Felo de ſe</hi> (you know, my Lady, what a Scholar your Brother has made me): So that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to think, the Poet himſelf is not ſo blameleſs in this as he has taken care to be in moſt of his Pieces. And permit me to make one Obſervation, my good Lady, That if the chaſteſt Writers, (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>Cowley</hi> meant ever ſo well) may have their Works and their Thoughts turn'd to be Panders and Promoters of the Wickedneſs of coarſe Minds, whoſe groſſer Ideas could not be cloathed in a Dreſs fit to appear in decent Company, without <hi>their</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, how careful ought a good Author to be, whoſe Works are ſo likely to live to the End of Time, how he propagates the worſt of Miſchiefs, to ſuch a Duration, when he himſelf is dead and gone, and incapable of antidoting the Poiſon he has ſpread?</p>
                  <p>Her Ladyſhip was pleaſed to kiſs me, as we ſat. My charming <hi>Pamela,</hi> my <hi>more than Siſter,</hi>—did ſhe ſay!—Yes ſhe did ſay ſo! and made my Eyes overflow with Joy to hear the ſweet Epithet!— How your Converſation charms me!—I charge you, when you get to Town, let me have your Remarks on the Diversions you will be carried to by my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now I know what to expect from <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>you</hi> know how acceptable every thing will be <hi>to me</hi> that comes from you, I promiſe great Pleaſure as well to myſelf as to my worthy Friends, particularly

Lady <hi>Betty,</hi> in your unreſtrained free Correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, <hi>Pamela,</hi> I muſt bring you acquainted with Lady <hi>Betty:</hi> She is one of the Worthies of our Sex, and has a fine Underſtanding.—I'm ſure you'll like her.—But (for the World ſay it not to my Brother, nor let Lady <hi>Betty</hi> know I tell you ſo, if ever you ſhould be acquainted—) I had carry'd the Matter ſo far by my officious Zeal to have my Brother marry'd to ſo fine a Lady, not doubting his joyful Approbation, that it was no ſmall Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>her,</hi> I can tell you, when he marry'd you: And this is the beſt Excuſe I can make for my furious Behaviour to you at the Hall. For tho' I am natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very haſty and paſſionate, yet then I was almoſt mad. — Indeed my Diſappointment had given me ſo much Indignation both againſt you, and him, that it is well I did not do ſome violent thing by you. <note n="*" place="bottom">Compare this Part of the Converſation, with Lady <hi>Davers</hi>'s Behaviour to <hi>Pamela, Vol. II.</hi> p. 222 to 250.</note> I believe you <hi>did</hi> feel the Weight of my Hand:— But what was that?—'Twas well I did not <hi>kill you dead</hi>—theſe were her Ladyſhip's Words—For how could I think the wild Libertine capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ingag'd by ſuch noble Motives, or Thee what thou art?—So this will account to thee a little for my Violence then.</p>
                  <p>Your Ladyſhip, ſaid I, all theſe Things conſider'd, had but too much Reaſon to be angry at your dear Brother's Proceedings, ſo well as you always lov'd him, ſo high a Concern as you always had to promote his Honour and Intereſt, and ſo far as you had gone with Lady <hi>Betty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I tell thee, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid ſhe, that the old Story of <hi>Eleanor</hi> and <hi>Roſamond</hi> run in my Head all the Way of my Journey, and I almoſt wiſhed for a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to force down thy Throat: And when I came,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0272600703:245"/>
and found thy lewd Paramour abſent, (for little did I think thou waſt marry'd to him, tho' I expected thou wouldſt endeavour to perſuade me to believe it) apprehending, that his Intrigue with thee would effectually fruſtrate my Hopes as to Lady <hi>Betty</hi> and him; Now, thought I, all happens as I wiſh!—Now will I confront this brazen Girl!—Now will I try her Innocence, as I pleaſe, by offering to take her with me out of his Hands; if ſhe refuſes, take that Refuſal for a Demonſtration of her Guilt; and then, thought I, I will make the Creature provoke me, in the Preſence of my Nephew and my Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (and I hoped to have got that Woman <hi>Jewkes</hi> to teſtify for me too); and I cannot tell what I might have done, if thou hadſt not got out of the Window as thou didſt, eſpecially after thou hadſt told me, thou waſt as much marry'd as I was, and hadſt ſhewn me his tender Letter to thee, which had a quite different Effect upon me than thou hadſt hoped for. But if I had committed any Act of Violence, what Remorſe ſhould I have had, when I came to reflect, and had known what an Excellence I had injured! Thank God, thou didſt eſcape me! thank God thou didſt! And then her Ladyſhip folded her Arms about me, and kiſſed me.</p>
                  <p>This was a ſad Story, you'll ſay, my dear Miſs: And I wonder what her Ladyſhip's Paſſion would have made her do! Surely ſhe would not have <hi>killed me dead</hi> indeed! ſurely ſhe would not!—Let it not, however, Miſs, nor you, my dear Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,— when you ſee it,—go out of your own Hands, nor be read, for my Lady's ſake, to any body elſe—No, Miſs, not to your own dear Mamma.—It made me tremble a little, even at this Diſtance, to think what a ſad thing Paſſion is, when Way is given to its ungovernable Tumults, and how it deforms and debaſes the nobleſt Minds!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0272600703:246"/>We returned from this agreeable Airing but juſt Time enough to dreſs before Dinner, and then I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended my Lady, and we went together into the Counteſs's Apartment, where I received abundance of Compliments from both. As this brief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation will give you ſome Notion of that Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Oeconomy for which they heaped upon me their kind Praiſes, I will recite to you what paſſed in it, and hope you will not think me too vain; and the leſs, becauſe what I underwent formerly from my Lady's Indignation, half intitles me to be proud of her preſent Kindneſs and Favour.</p>
                  <p>Lady <hi>Davers</hi> ſaid, Your Ladyſhip muſt excuſe us, that we have loſt ſo much of your Company; but here, this ſweet Girl has entertained me in ſuch a manner, that I could have ſtaid out with her all Day; and ſeveral times did I bid the Coachman prolong his Circuit.</p>
                  <p>My good Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> Madam, ſaid I, has given me inexpreſſible Pleaſure, and has been all Condeſcenſion and Favour, and made me as proud as proud can be.</p>
                  <p>You, my dear Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid ſhe, may have given great Pleaſure to Lady <hi>Davers</hi>; for it cannot be otherwiſe.—But I have no great Notion of her Ladyſhip's Condeſcenſion, as you call it, (pardon me, Madam, ſaid ſhe to her, ſmiling) when ſhe cannot raiſe her Style above the Word <hi>Girl,</hi> coming off from a Tour you have made ſo delightful to her.</p>
                  <p>I proteſt to you, my Lady <hi>C.</hi> reply'd her Ladyſhip, with great Goodneſs, that Epithet which once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I beſtow'd thro' Pride, as you'll call it, I now give for a very different Reaſon. I begin to doubt, whether to call her Siſter is not more Honour to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf than to her; and to this Hour am not quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd. When I am, I will call her ſo with Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>I was quite overcome with this fine Compliment, but could not anſwer a Word: And the Counteſs
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0272600703:247"/>
ſaid, I could have ſpared you longer, had not the Time of Day compell'd your Return. For I have been very agreeably entertained, as well as you, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' but with the Talk of my Woman and yours: For here they have been giving me ſuch an Account of Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>'s Oeconomy, and Family Management, as has highly delighted me. I never knew the like; and in ſo young a Lady too. We ſhall have ſtrange Reformations to make, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> when we go home, in our Families, were we to follow ſo good an Example.</p>
                  <p>Why, my dear Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> continued her Ladyſhip, you outdo all your Neighbours. And indeed I am glad I live ſo far from you:—For were I to try to imitate you, it would ſtill be <hi>but</hi> Imitation, and you'd have the Honour of it.</p>
                  <p>Yet you hear, and you ſee by Yeſterday's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> how much her beſt Neighbours of both Sexes admire her: They all yield to her the Palm, unenvying.</p>
                  <p>Then, my good Ladies, ſaid I, it is a Sign I have moſt excellent Neighbours, full of Generoſity, and willing to incourage a young Perſon in doing right things: So it makes, conſidering what I was, more for their Honour than my own. For what Cenſures ſhould not ſuch an one as I deſerve, who have not been educated to fill up my Time like Ladies of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, were I not to imploy myſelf as I do? I, who have ſo little other Merit, and who brought no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune at all?</p>
                  <p>Come, come, <hi>Pamela,</hi> none of your ſelf-denying Ordinances—that was Lady <hi>Davers</hi>'s Word—You muſt know ſomething of your own Excellence:— If you do not, I'll tell it you, becauſe there is no Fear you will be proud or vain upon it. I don't ſee then, that there is the Lady in your Neighbourhood, of any Neighbourhood, that behaves with a more
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0272600703:248"/>
proper Decorum, or better keeps up the Port of a Lady, than you do. How you manage it I can't tell; but you do as much by a Look, and a pleaſant one too, that's the Rarity! as I do by high Words, and paſſionate Exclamations: I have often nothing but Blunder upon Blunder, as if the Wretches were in a Confederacy to try my Patience.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, Madam, ſaid I, the Awe they have of your Ladyſhip, becauſe of your high Qualities, makes them commit Blunders; for I myſelf have always been more afraid of appearing before your Ladyſhip, when you have viſited your honoured Mother, than of any body elſe, and have been the more ſenſibly aukward thro' that very aweful Reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Pſha, pſha! <hi>Pamela,</hi> that is not it: 'Tis all in your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I us'd to think my Mamma, and my Brother too, had as aukward Servants as I ever ſaw any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where —except Mrs. <hi>Jervis.</hi>—Well enough for a Batchelor, indeed!—But, here!—thou haſt not parted with one Servant—Haſt thou?</p>
                  <p>No, my Lady.</p>
                  <p>How! ſaid the Counteſs; what Excellence is here! All of them, pardon me, Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> your Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervants, as one may ſay, and all of them ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful, ſo watchful of your Eye; and you, at the ſame time, ſo gentle to them, ſo eaſy, ſo chearful!</p>
                  <p>Don't you think me, Miſs, inſufferably vain? But 'tis what they were pleaſed to ſay. 'Twas their Goodneſs to me, and ſhew'd how much they can excel in generous Politeneſs. So I will proceed.</p>
                  <p>Why this, continued the Counteſs, muſt be <hi>born</hi> Dignity,—<hi>born</hi> Diſcretion.—Education cannot give it:—If it could, why ſhould not <hi>we</hi> have it?</p>
                  <p>The Ladies ſaid many more kind things of me then; and after Dinner they mentioned all over again, with Additions, before my beſt Friend, who was kindly delighted with the Encomiums given me by
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0272600703:249"/>
two Ladies of ſuch diſtinguiſhing Judgment in all other Caſes. They told him, how much they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired my Family Management: Then would have it, that my Genius was univerſal, for the Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Accompliſhments of my Sex, whether they conſider'd it, they were pleaſed to ſay, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in Penmanſhip, in Needle-work, in paying or receiving Viſits, in Muſick, and I can't tell how many other Qualifications, which their Goodneſs made them attribute to me, over and above the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Management; ſaying, that I had an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that comprehended every thing, and an Eye that penetrated into the very Bottom of Matters in a Moment, and was never at a Loſs for the <hi>Should be,</hi> the <hi>Why</hi> or <hi>Wherefore,</hi> and the <hi>How;</hi> theſe were their comprehenſive Words — I did every thing with ſo much Celerity, clearing all as I went, and leaving nothing, that was their Obſervation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur or come over again, that could be diſpatched at once: By which means, they ſaid, every Hand was clear to undertake a new Work, as well as my own Head to direct it; and there was no Hurry nor Confuſion; but every coming Hour was freſh and ready, and unincumber'd, (ſo they ſaid) for its new Employment; and to this they attributed that Eaſe and Pleaſure with which every thing was performed, and that I could <hi>do,</hi> and <hi>cauſe</hi> to be done, ſo much Buſineſs without Hurry either to myſelf or Servants.</p>
                  <p>Theſe kind things, they would have it, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in part themſelves, and in part from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of their Women, who looked, they ſaid, ſo narrowly into every Part of the Management, as if they were Spies upon it; but were ſuch faithful ones, that it was like a good Cauſe brought to a ſtrict Scrutiny, the brighter and fairer for it.</p>
                  <p>Thus, my dear Miſs, did their Ladyſhips praiſe me for what I <hi>ought</hi> to be; and I will endeavour to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0272600703:250"/>
improve more and more by their kind Admonitions, which come cloathed in the agreeable and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Shape of Praiſe, the nobleſt Incitement to the doing of one's Duty.</p>
                  <p>Judge you how pleaſing this was to my beſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, who found, in their kind Approbation, ſuch a Juſtification of his own Conduct, that could not fail of being pleaſing to him, eſpecially as Lady <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> was one of the kind Praiſers.</p>
                  <p>Lord <hi>Davers</hi> was ſo highly delighted, that he roſe once, begging his Brother's Excuſe, to ſalute me, and remained ſtanding over my Chair, with a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his Looks that cannot be expreſſed, now-and-then lifting up his Hands, and his good-natur'd Eye gliſtening with Joy, which a Pier-glaſs gave me the Opportunity of ſeeing, as ſometimes I ſtole a baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Glance towards it, not knowing how or which way to look. Even Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſeem'd to be touch'd very ſenſibly; and recollecting his Behaviour to me at the Hall, he once cry'd out, What a ſad Whelp was <hi>I,</hi> to behave as I once did, to ſo much Excellence!— Not, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that I was any thing uncivil neither; —but in unworthy Sneers, and Nonſenſe.— You know me well enough.—P—x on me for a Jackanapes!—You call'd me, <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <hi>Tinſeld Toy,</hi> tho', Madam; don't you remember that? and ſaid, <hi>Twenty or thirty Years hence, when I was at Age, you'd give me an Anſwer.</hi>—Egad! I ſhall never forget your Looks, nor your Words neither! — They were d—n'd ſevere Speeches, were they not, Sir?</p>
                  <p>O you ſee, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaid my dear Gentleman, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela</hi> is not quite perfect.—We muſt not provoke her; for ſhe'll call us both ſo, perhaps; for I wear a lac'd Waiſtcoat, ſometimes, as well as you.</p>

                  <p>Thy ſilly Tongue, ſaid my Lady, runs on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fear or Wit. What's paſt is paſt.</p>
                  <p>Why, i'faith, Madam, I was plaguily wrong; and I ſaid nothing of any body but <hi>myſelf:</hi>—And have been ready to hang myſelf ſince, as often as I have thought of my Nonſenſe.</p>
                  <p>My Nephew, ſaid my Lord, muſt bring in Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the Gallows, in every Speech he makes, or it will not be he.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſmiling, ſaid, with Severity enough in his Meaning, as I could ſee by the Turn of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, —Mr. <hi>H.</hi> knows, that his Birth and Family intitle him more to the Block, than the Rope, or he would not make ſo free with the latter.</p>
                  <p>Good! very good, by <hi>Jupiter!</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>H.</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Counteſs ſmil'd. Lady <hi>Davers</hi> ſhook her Head at her Brother, and ſaid to her Nephew, Thou'rt a good-natur'd fooliſh Fellow, that thou art.</p>
                  <p>For what, Madam? Why the Word, <hi>fooliſh,</hi> Aunt? What have I ſaid now?</p>
                  <p>Nothing to any Purpoſe, indeed! ſaid ſhe; when thou doſt, I'll write it down.</p>
                  <p>Then, Madam, ſaid he, have your Pen and Ink always about you, when I'm preſent. — The Devil's in't if you won't put that down, to begin with!</p>
                  <p>This made every one laugh. What a happy thing it is, thought I, that Good-nature generally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies this Character; elſe, my dear Miſs, how would ſome People be ſupportable?</p>
                  <p>But here I'll break off.

                  <p>But my only Doubt is, that to Ladies, who have not been accuſtomed perhaps to the <hi>neceſſary</hi> Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſhould make myſelf cenſurable, as if I aimed at too much Perfection: For however one's Duty is one's Duty, and ought not to be diſpenſed with; yet when a Perſon, who uſes to be remiſs, ſees ſo hard a Task before them, and ſo many great Points to get over, all to be no more than tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably regular, it is rather apt to frighten and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage than to allure; and one muſt proceed, as I have read Soldiers do in a difficult Siege, Inch
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0272600703:253"/>
by Inch, and be more ſtudious to intrench and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify themſelves as they go on gaining upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, than by ruſhing all at once upon an Attack of the Place, be repulſed, and perhaps obliged with great Loſs to abandon an hopeful Enterprize.</p>
                  <p>And permit me to add, that, young as I am, I have often obſerved, that over-great Strictneſſes all at once injoin'd, and inſiſted upon, are not fit for a beginning Reformation, but for ſtronger Chriſtians only; and therefore generally do more Harm than Good, in ſuch a Circumſtance.</p>
                  <p>What a miſerable Creature am I, ſaid a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Widow Gentlewoman, (whom I viſited in her Illneſs, at her own Deſire, tho' a Stranger to me but by Name) if all the Good <hi>you</hi> do, and the ſtrict Life <hi>you</hi> live, is no more than abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation!</p>
                  <p>I ſaw the poor Gentlewoman, thro' Illneſs and low Spirits, was ready to deſpond, and, to comfort her, I ſaid, Dear Madam, don't be caſt down: God Almighty gives us all a Light to walk by in theſe our dark Paths; and 'tis my humble Opinion, He will judge us according to the <hi>unforced</hi> and <hi>unbyaſſed</hi> Uſe we make of that Light. I think it my Duty to do ſeveral. Things, which, perhaps, the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of others will not permit them to do, or which they, on ſerious and diſintereſted Reflection, may not think abſolutely neceſſary to be done: In each Caſe our Judgments are a Law to each; and I ought no more to excuſe myſelf from doing ſuch Parts as I think my Duty, than you to condemn yourſelf for not doing what does not appear to you ſo ſtrictly neceſſary: And beſides, Madam, you may do as much Good one way, as I another, and ſo both may be equally uſeful in the general Syſtem of Providence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0272600703:254"/>But ſhall I not be too grave, my dear Miſs?— Excuſe me; for this is <hi>Saturday</hi> Night; and as it was a very good Method which the ingenious Authors of the <hi>Spectators</hi> took, generally to treat their more ſerious Subjects on this Day; ſo I think one ſhould, when one can, conſider it as the preparative Eve to a ſtill better.</p>

                  <head>SUNDAY.</head>
                  <p>NOW, my dear Miſs, by what I have already written, it is become in a manner neceſſary to acquaint you briefly with the Method my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> not only permits, but incourages me to take in the Family he leaves to my Care, as to the <hi>Sunday</hi> Duty.</p>
                  <p>The worthy Dean, at my Requeſt, and by my Beloved's Permiſſion, recommended to me, as a ſort of Family Chaplain, for <hi>Sundays,</hi> a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great Sobriety, and Piety, and ſound Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, who having but lately taken Orders, has at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent no other Proviſion. And this Gentleman comes, and reads Prayers to us about Seven in the Morning, in the leſſer Hall, as we call it, a retired Apartment, next the little Garden; for we have no Chapel with us here, as in your Neighbourhood: And this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, with ſome ſuitable Exhortation, or Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of ſome good Book, which the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is ſo kind to let me chuſe now-and-then, when I pleaſe, takes up little more than half an Hour.</p>
                  <p>We have a great Number of Servants of both Sexes; and myſelf, my good Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> and my <hi>Polly Barlow,</hi> are generally in a little Cloſet, which, when we open the Door, is but juſt a Separation, and that's all, from the Hall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0272600703:255"/>Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> (for that is our young Clergyman's Name) has a Desk, at which ſometimes Mr. <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> makes up his running Accounts to Mr. <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>; who is very ſcrupulous of admitting any body to the Uſe of his Office, becauſe of the Writings in his Cuſtody, and the Order he values himſelf upon having every thing in.</p>
                  <p>About Seven in the Evening the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man comes again, and I generally, let me have what Company I will, find time to retire for about another Half-hour, and my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> connives at, and excuſes my Abſence, if inquir'd after, tho', for ſo ſhort a time, I am ſeldom miſs'd.</p>
                  <p>To the young Gentleman I ſhall preſent, every Quarter, Five Guineas; and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> preſſes him to accept of a Place at his Table, at his Pleaſure: But, as we have generally a good deal of Company, his Modeſty makes him decline it, and ſit down, when he pleaſes, with Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> who have a ſeparate Table.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> is ſo kind as to join with us very often in our <hi>Sunday</hi> Office, and Mr. <hi>Colbrand</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom miſſes; and they tell Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> that they cannot expreſs the Pleaſure they have to meet me there; and the Edification they receive, as they are ſo kind to ſay, from my Example; and the chearful Temper I am always in, which does 'em good to look upon me: And they will have it, that I do Credit to Religion. But if they do but think ſo, it muſt have been of Service to me in the Order I have now eſtabliſhed, as I hope; and that thro' leſs Difficulties than I expected to meet with, eſpecially from the <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>See</hi> Vol. I. <hi>p.</hi> 126. Vol. II. <hi>p.</hi> 346.</note> Cookmaid; but ſhe ſays, ſhe comes with double Delight to have the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0272600703:256"/>
Opportunity to ſee her beloved Lady, as ſhe calls me, it ſeems, at every Word.</p>
                  <p>My beſt Beloved diſpenſes as much as he can with the Servants, for the Evening Part, if he has Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or will be attended only by <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> perhaps, by Turns; and ſometimes looks upon his Watch, and ſays, 'Tis near Seven; and if he ſays ſo, they take it for a Hint they may be diſpens'd with for half an Hour; and this Countenance which the dear Gentleman gives me, has not contributed a little to make the Matter eaſy and delightful to me and to every one.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure, my dear Miſs, were only Policy to be conſidered, this Method muſt be laudable; for ſince I have begun it, there is not a more diligent, a more ſober, nor more courteous Set of Servants in any Family in a great Way: We have no Broils, no hard Words, no Revilings, no Commandings, nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings; and Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi>'s Government is made ſo eaſy, as ſhe ſays, that ſhe need not ſpeak twice; and all the Language of the Servants is, Pray, <hi>John,</hi> or Pray, <hi>Jane,</hi> do ſo or ſo; and they ſay, Their dear Maſter's Service is a Heaven upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>When I part from them, on the breaking up of our Aſſembly, they generally make a little Row on each Side to the Hall-door, and when I have made my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, and paid my Thanks to Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> one whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers, as I go out, God bleſs you, Madam! And ſo ſays another, and another, and indeed every one; and bow and court'ſy with ſuch Pleaſure in their honeſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, as greatly delights me: And I ſay, (if it ſo happens) So, my good Friends!—I am glad to ſee you—Not one abſent!—or but one—(as it falls out) —This is very obliging, I cry: And thus I ſhew them, that I take Notice, if any body be not there. And back again I go to pay my Duty to my Earthly Benefactor; and he is pleaſed to ſay ſometimes, that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0272600703:257"/>
I come to him with ſuch a Radiance, playing about my Eyes, and ſhining over my whole Face, as gives him double Pleaſure to behold me; and often he tells me afterwards, that, but for appearing too fond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Company, he could meet me, as I enter, with Embraces as pure as my own Heart.</p>
                  <p>I hope, in time, I ſhall prevail upon the dear Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to give me his Company.—But, thank God, I am inabled to go thus far already!—I will leave the reſt to his Providence. For I have a Point very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate to touch upon in this Particular; and I muſt take care, not to loſe the Ground I have gained, by too precipitately puſhing at too much at once. This is my Comfort, that next to being uniform <hi>himſelf,</hi> is that Permiſſion and Incouragement he gives <hi>me</hi> to be ſo, and the Pleaſure he takes in ſeeing me ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted.—And beſides, the dear Gentleman always gives me his Company to Church. O how happy ſhould I think myſelf, if he would be pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me to the Divine Office, which yet he has not done, tho' I have urg'd him as much as I durſt! One thing after another, he ſays; we ſhall be better and better, I hope: But nobody is good all at once. But, my dear Miſs, as I conſider this as the Seal of all the reſt, and he himſelf has an awful Notion of it, I ſhall hardly think my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Morals fully ſecur'd till then.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> ask'd me on <hi>Saturday</hi> Evening, If I would be concerned to ſee a larger Congregation in the leſſer Hall next Morning, than uſual? I ſaid, No, by no means. She ſaid, Mrs. <hi>Worden,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Leſley,</hi> (the two Ladies Women) and Mr. <hi>Sydney,</hi> my Lord <hi>Davers</hi>'s Gentleman, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Servant, and the Coachmen and Footmen, belonging to our noble Viſitors, who are, ſhe ſays, all great Admirers of our Family Management, and good Order, having been told our Method, begg'd to join in it. I knew I
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0272600703:258"/>
ſhould be a little daſh'd at ſo large a Company; but the Men being pretty orderly, for Lords Servants, and Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> aſſuring me, that they were very earneſt in their Requeſt, I conſented to it.</p>
                  <p>When, at the uſual Time, (attended by my <hi>Polly</hi>) I went down, I found Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> there, (to whom I made my firſt Compliments) and every one of our own People, waiting for me, Mr. <hi>Colbrand</hi> excepted, (whom Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had kept up late the Night before) together with Mrs. <hi>Worden</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Leſley,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sydney,</hi> with the Servants of our Gueſts, who, as alſo worthy Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jonathan,</hi> paid me their Reſpects; and I ſaid, This is early riſing, Mrs. <hi>Leſley</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Worden</hi>; you are very kind to countenance us with your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies in this our Family Order.—Mr. <hi>Sidney,</hi> I am glad to ſee you. How do you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. <hi>Longman?</hi> And looked round with Complacency on the Servants of our noble Viſitors. And then I led Mrs. <hi>Worden</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Leſley</hi> to my little Retiring-place, and Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> and my <hi>Polly</hi> followed, and throwing the Door open, Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> began ſome ſelect Prayers; and as the young Gentleman reads with great Emphaſis) and Propriety, and as if his Heart was in what he read, all the good Folks were exceedingly attentive.</p>
                  <p>After Prayers, Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> read a Meditation, from a Collection made for private Uſe, which I ſhall more particularly mention by-and-by; and ending with the uſual Benediction, I thank'd the worthy Gentleman, and reproach'd him, in Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Name, for his Modeſty, in declining our Table; and, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Worden,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Leſley,</hi> receiv'd their kind Wiſhes, and haſten'd, bluſhing, thro' their Praiſes, to my Chamber, where, being alone, I purſued the Subject for an Hour, till Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt was ready, when I attended the Ladies, and my
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0272600703:259"/>
beſt Beloved, who had told them of the Verſes plac'd under my Cuſhion at Church.</p>
                  <p>We ſet out, my Lord and Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> and myſelf, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in our Coach; and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and the Counteſs, in the Chariot, both Ladies, and the Gentlemen, ſplendidly dreſs'd; but I avoided a Glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as much as I could, that I might not ſeem to vie with the two Peereſſes.—Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid, Why are you not full dreſs'd, my Dear?—I ſaid, I hop'd he would not be diſpleaſed: If he was, I would do as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. He anſwer'd, As you like beſt, my Love. You are a charming Creature in every Dreſs.</p>
                  <p>The Chariot firſt drawing up to the Church-Door, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> led the Counteſs into the Church. My Lord <hi>Davers</hi> did me that Honour; and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> handed his Aunt, thro' a Croud of Gazers, many of whom, as uſual, were Strangers. The Neighbouring Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and their Ladies paid us their ſilent Reſpects; but the Thoughts of the wicked Verſes, or rather, as Lady <hi>Davers</hi> will have me ſay, wicked Action of the Tranſcriber of them, made me keep behind in the Pew: But, my Lady, with great Goodneſs, ſat down by me, and whiſperingly talked a good deal, between whiles, to me, with great Tenderneſs and Freedom in her Aſpect; which I could not but take kindly, becauſe I know ſhe intended by it, to ſhew every one ſhe was pleas'd with me.</p>
                  <p>Among other things ſhe ſaid ſoftly, Who would wiſh to be a King or Queen, <hi>Pamela,</hi> if it is ſo eaſy for Virtue and Beauty (ſo ſhe was pleas'd to ſay) to attract ſo many ſincere Admirers, without any of their Grandeur?—Look round, my dear Girl, and ſee what a ſolemn Reſpect, and mingled Delight, appears in every Countenance.</p>
                  <p>And preſſing my Hand, Thou art a charming Creature; ſuch a noble Modeſty, and yet ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Dignity in thy whole Appearance! No wonder
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0272600703:260"/>
that every one's Eyes are upon thee, and that thou bringeſt ſo many booted Gentlemen as well as Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to croud the Church, to behold thee!</p>
                  <p>Afterwards ſhe was pleaſed to add, taking my Hand, (and my dear Gentleman and the Counteſs heard her; for ſhe raiſed her Voice to a more audible Whiſper) I am proud to be in thy Company; and in this ſolemn Place, I take thy Hand, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, with Pride, my <hi>Siſter.</hi> I looked down; for here at Church, I can hardly at any time look up; for who can bear to be gaz'd at ſo?—And ſoftly ſaid, Oh! my good Lady! how much you honour me, the Place, and theſe ſurrounding Eyes, can only hinder me from acknowleging as I ought.</p>
                  <p>My beſt Friend, with Pleaſure in his Eyes, ſaid, preſſing his Hand upon both ours, as my Lady had mine in hers, you are two beloved Creatures: Both excellent in your way. God bleſs you both. And you, too, my dear Brother, ſaid my Lady. The Counteſs whiſper'd, You ſhould ſpare a-body a little! You give one, Ladies, and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> too much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure all at once. Such Company, and ſuch Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, adds ſtill more Charms to Devotion; and were I to be here a Twelvemonth, I would never miſs once accompanying You to this good Place.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> thought he muſt ſay ſomething, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to his noble Uncle, who could not keep his good-natur'd Eye off me, I'll be <hi>hang'd,</hi> my Lord, if I know how to behave myſelf!—Why this outdoes the Chapel!—I'm glad I put on my new Suit! And then he look'd upon himſelf, as if he would ſupport, as well as he could, his Part of the general Admiration.</p>
                  <p>But think you not, my dear Miſs, and my deareſt Father and Mother, that I am now at the Height of my Happineſs in this Life, thus favour'd by Lady <hi>Davers!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0272600703:261"/>The Dean preached an excellent Sermon; but I need not to have ſaid that. Only to have mention'd, that <hi>he</hi> preached, was ſaying enough.</p>
                  <p>My Lord led me out, when Divine Service was over, (and being a little tender in his Feet, from a Gouty Notice, walked very ſlowly) Mr. <hi>B.</hi> led the Counteſs, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Aunt. Lady <hi>Towers,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Brooks</hi> join'd us in the Porch; and made us their Compliments; as did Mr. <hi>Martin.</hi> Will you favour us with your Company home, my old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to that Gentleman? I can't, having a Gentleman my Relation to dine with me; but if it will be agreeable in the Evening, I will bring him with me to taſte of your <hi>Burgundy</hi>; for we have not any ſuch in the County: I ſhall be glad to ſee you and any Friend of yours, reply'd Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> whiſper'd, It is more, however, to admire your Lady, I can tell you that, than your Wine.— Get into your Coaches, Ladies, ſaid he, with his uſual Freedom; our Maiden and Widow Ladies have a fine Time of it, where-ever you come: By my Faith, they muſt every one of them quit this Neighbourhood, if you were to ſtay in it; but all the Hopes they have, are, that while you're in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> they'll have the Game in their own Hands.</p>
                  <p>Siſter, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> moſt kindly to me, in Preſence of many, who (in a reſpectful manner) gather'd near us, Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> is the ſame Gentleman he us'd to be, I ſee.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> Madam, ſaid I, ſmiling, has but one Fault: He is too apt to praiſe whom he favours, at the Expence of his abſent Friends!</p>
                  <p>I am always proud of your Reproofs, Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd he.</p>
                  <p>Ay, ſaid Lady <hi>Towers,</hi> that I believe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wiſh, for all our ſakes, you'd take him oftener to Task, Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>

                  <p>I ſaw Sir <hi>Thomas Atkyns</hi> coming towards us, and fearing to be ſtifled with Compliments, I ſaid, Your Servant, Ladies, and Gentlemen; and, giving my Hand to Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> ſtept into the Chariot, inſtead of the Coach; for People that would avoid Buſtle, ſometimes make it. Finding my Miſtake, I would have come out; but my Lord ſaid, Indeed you ſhan't: And I'll ſtep in, becauſe I'll have you all to myſelf.</p>
                  <p>Lady <hi>Davers</hi> ſmil'd, Now, ſaid ſhe, (while the Coach drew up) is my Lord <hi>Davers</hi> pleas'd; but I ſee, Siſter, you were tir'd with Part of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the Coach.</p>
                  <p>'Tis well contriv'd, my Dear, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as long as you have not depriv'd me of this Honour; taking the Counteſs's Hand, and leading her into the Coach.</p>
                  <p>Will you excuſe all this Impertinence, my dear Miſs?—I know my dear Father and Mother will be pleas'd with it; and you will have the Goodneſs to bear with me on that Account; for their kind Hearts will be delighted to hear every minute thing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Lady <hi>Davers</hi> and myſelf.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> came in the Evening, with his Friend, (who is Sir <hi>William G.</hi> a polite young Gentleman of <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi>) he told us a deal of the Praiſes laviſh'd away upon me by ſeveral genteel
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0272600703:263"/>
Strangers; one ſaying, to his Friend, he had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled twenty Miles to ſee me.</p>
                  <p>My Lady <hi>Davers</hi> was praiſed too for her Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me, and the Gracefulneſs of her Perſon; the Counteſs for the noble Serenity of her Aſpect, and that charming Eaſe and Freedom which diſtinguiſh her Birth and Quality: My dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> he ſaid, was greatly admired too; but he would not make <hi>him</hi> proud; for he had Superiorities enough already, that was his Word, over his Gentlemen Neighbours: But I can tell you, ſaid he, that for moſt of your Praiſes you are obliged to your Lady, for having rewarded her Excellence as you have done: For one Gentleman, added he, ſaid, He knew no one but you could deſerve her; and he believed you did, from that Tenderneſs in your Behaviour to her, and from that Grandeur of Air, and Majeſty of Perſon, that ſeem'd to ſhew you form'd for her Protector as well as Rewarder. — Get you gone to <hi>London,</hi> both of you, ſaid he. I did not intend to tell you, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> what was ſaid of you. — And indeed I ſee no ſuch extraordinary Excellence; do you, Sir, to his Friend, in that Gentleman?—Sir <hi>William</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was all that was polite and noble, and it was no Wonder that every body pronounced us both the charmingeſt Couple they had ever ſeen.</p>
                  <p>The Women of the two Ladies had acquainted their Ladyſhips with the Order I obſerved for the Day, and the devout Behaviour of the Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And about Seven I withdrawing as ſilently and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved as I could, was ſurpriſed, as I was going thro' the great Hall, to be joined by both.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall come at all your Secrets, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid my Lady, and be able, in time, to cut you out in your own way. I know whither you are going.</p>
                  <p>My good Ladies, ſaid I, forgive me leaving you. I will attend you in half an Hour.</p>

                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0272600703:264"/>No, my Dear, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> the Counteſs and I have reſolved to attend <hi>you</hi> for that Half-hour, and we will return to Company together.</p>
                  <p>Is it not deſcending too much, my Ladies, as to the Company?</p>
                  <p>If it is for us, it is for you, ſaid the Counteſs; ſo we will either act up to you, or make you come down to us; and we will judge of all your Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>Nay, my dear Ladies! ſaid I; and ſat down on the firſt Chair.</p>
                  <p>Nay, my dear <hi>Pamela!</hi> returned my Lady, ſhew us the Way.</p>
                  <p>If I muſt, I muſt—But I was much abaſhed.</p>
                  <p>Every one, but <hi>Abraham,</hi> who attended the Gentlemen, and all their Ladyſhips Servants, and their two Women, and Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> were there; which pleas'd me, however, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhew'd me, that even the Strangers, by this their ſecond voluntary Attendance, had no ill Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Service. But they were all ſtartled, ours and theirs, to ſee my Ladies accompanying me.</p>
                  <p>I ſtept up to Mr. <hi>Adams.</hi>—I was in hopes, Sir, ſaid I, we ſhould have been favour'd with your Company at our Table.</p>
                  <p>Your Ladyſhip, ſaid he, will excuſe me: I did not think myſelf Company for ſuch noble Gueſts as were there.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman and a Scholar is Company, ſaid the Counteſs, for the firſt Quality.</p>
                  <p>Well, Sir, ſaid I, you ſee the Nobleneſs of theſe Ladies. They come now to be obliged to you, for your good Offices; and you'll have no better way of letting them return their Obligation, than to ſup, tho' you would not dine, with them.</p>
                  <p>My Lady tapp'd me on the Neck—Genteelly ſaid! This was like my Siſter, her own Self. Mr.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0272600703:265"/>
                     <hi>Longman,</hi> ſaid ſhe, how do you?—We are come to be Witneſſes of my Siſter's Goodneſs, and the Family Decorum.</p>
                  <p>We have a bleſſed Lady, Madam, ſaid he: And your Ladyſhips Preſence augments our Joys.</p>
                  <p>Let us follow you, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid ſhe: We muſt learn of you what we are to do.</p>
                  <p>I led to the little Cloſet, with as much Preſence of Mind as I could, and my two Ladies followed me; and Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Worden,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Leſley,</hi> ſtood juſt without, the Door being half ſhut, for their Ladies ſakes.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have ſaid, we were not at Church in the Afternoon.—And when I do not go, we have the Evening Service read to us, as it is at Church; which Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> performed now with his uſual Diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Fervour; and the Ladies ſeem'd not at all uneaſy, altho' we had a Meditation beſides.</p>
                  <p>When all was concluded, I ſaid, Now, my deareſt Ladies, excuſe me for the ſake of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light I take in ſeeing all my good Folks about me in this decent and obliging manner.—Indeed I have no Oſtentation in it, if I know my own Heart— Indeed I have not!</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs and my Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> delighted to ſee ſuch good Behaviour in every one, ſat a Moment or two looking upon one another in Silence; and then my Lady <hi>Davers</hi> caught me in her Arms: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, deſervedly beloved of the kindeſt of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, what a Bleſſing art thou to this Family!</p>
                  <p>And to every Family, ſaid the Counteſs, who have the Happineſs to know, and the Grace to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, her Example! and ſaluted me too. But where, ſaid my Lady, collectedſt thou all this good Senſe, and fine Spirit, in thy Devotions?</p>
                  <p>The Bible, my dear Ladies, ſaid I, is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all: But this, and their Common-Prayer
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0272600703:266"/>
Book, and the Duty of Man, our good Folks have every one of them, and are ſo good as to imploy themſelves in them at all Leiſure Opportunities on other Days. For which Reaſon, that I may diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſify their Devotions, I have, with the Aſſiſtance of Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> and by Advice of the Dean, made Extracts from ſeveral good Pieces, which we read on theſe Days. Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> ſaid my Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> will you oblige me with a Copy of my Siſter's Book, at your Leiſure: He readily ingag'd to do this; and the Counteſs deſir'd another Copy, which he alſo promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Lady <hi>Davers</hi> then turning herſelf to Mrs. <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> How do you, good Woman? ſaid ſhe.—Why you are now made ample Amends for the Love you bore to this dear Creature formerly!</p>
                  <p>You have an Angel, and not a Woman, for your Lady, my good Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> ſaid the Counteſs.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> folding her uplifted Hands together, O my Lady! you know not our Happineſs; no, not one Half of it. We were before bleſs'd with Plenty, and a bountiful Indulgence, by our good Maſter; but our Plenty brought on Wantonneſs and Pride: But now, we have Peace as well as Plenty; and Peace of Mind, my dear Lady, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all in our reſpective Powers, to ſhew us thankful Creatures to God, and to the beſt of Maſters and Miſtreſſes.</p>
                  <p>Good Soul! ſaid I, and was ſorc'd to put my Handkerchief to my Eye: Your Heart is always overflowing thus with Gratitude, and Praiſes, for what you ſo well merit from us.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Longman,</hi> ſaid my Lady, aſſuming a ſprightly Air, altho' her Eye twinkled, to keep within its Lids the precious Water, that ſprang from a noble and well-affected Heart, I am glad to ſee you here, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending your pious young Lady.—Well might you
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0272600703:267"/>
love her, honeſt Man! well might you!—I did not know there was ſo excellent a Creature in any Rank.</p>
                  <p>Madam, ſaid the other worthy Heart, unable to ſpeak but in broken Sentences,—You don't know —indeed you don't, what a—what a—hap— happy—Family we are!—Truly, we are like unto <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Soldiers, every one fit to be a General; ſo well do we all know our Duties, and <hi>practiſe</hi> them too, let me ſay.—Nay, and pleaſe your Ladyſhip, we all of us long, till Morning comes, thus to attend my Lady; and after that is paſt, we long for Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the ſame Purpoſe: For ſhe is <hi>ſo</hi> good to us, —You cannot think how good ſhe is! But permit your honoured Father's old Servant to ſay one Word more, that tho' we are always pleaſed and joyful on theſe Occaſions; yet we are in Tranſports to ſee our Maſter's noble Siſter thus favouring us, with your Ladyſhip too, (to the Counteſs) and approving our young Lady's Conduct and Piety.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſing on you all! ſaid my Lady.—Let us go, my Lady,—let us go, Siſter;—for I can ſtay no longer!</p>
                  <p>As I ſlid by, following their Ladyſhips, How do you, Mr. <hi>Colorand?</hi> ſaid I, ſoftly: — I fear'd you was not well in the Morning.—He bow'd, Par-don me, Ma-dame — I vas leetell indiſpoſe, dat iſh true!</p>
                  <p>Now, my dear Miſs, will you forgive me all this Self-praiſe, as it may ſeem.—Yet when you know I give it you, and my dear Parents, as ſo many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of my Lady <hi>Davers</hi>'s Reconciliation and Goodneſs to me, and as it will ſhew what a noble Heart that good Lady has at Bottom, when her Pride of Quality and her Paſſion have ſubſided, and her native good Senſe and Excellence take place, I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf, I may be the rather excuſed; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0272600703:268"/>
as I hope to have my dear Miſs <hi>Darnford</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Countenance one Day, in this my delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Sunday</hi> Imployment.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have added, for I think a good Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cannot be too much reſpected, that I repeated my Requeſt to Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> to oblige us with his Company at Supper; but he ſo very earneſtly begg'd to be excuſed, and with ſo much Concern of Countenance, that I thought it would be wrong to inſiſt upon it; tho' I was ſorry for it, becauſe I am ſure, as of any thing, that Modeſty is always a Sign of Merit.</p>
                  <p>We return'd to the Gentlemen as ſoon as Supper was ready, and as chearful and eaſy, as Lady <hi>Davers</hi> obſerv'd, as if we had not been preſent at ſo ſolemn a Service; And this, ſaid ſhe, after the Gentlemen were gone, makes Religion ſo pleaſant and delightful a thing, that I profeſs I ſhall have a much higher Opinion of thoſe who make it a regular and conſtant Part of their Imployment, than ever I had. But I have ſeen, added her Ladyſhip, very humorouſly, ſuch wry Faces, and ſuch gloomy Countenances, among ſome of your pious Folks, in and after a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Office, that quite diſhearten'd me; for I thought, after ſuch an Exerciſe, that it would be a Sin to go to Bed with a Smile upon one's Face, or without ſighing and groaning at ſuch a Rate, as muſt rob one of all the Comforts of Life.</p>
                  <p>Then, ſaid ſhe, I was once, I remember, when a Girl, at the Houſe of a very devout Man, for a Week, with his Grand-daughter, my School-fellow; and there were ſuch Preachments againſt Vanities, and for Self-denials, that were we to have followed the good Man's Precepts, (tho' indeed not his Practice, for well did he love his Belly) half God Almighty's Creatures and Works would have been uſeleſs, and Induſtry would have been baniſh'd the Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0272600703:269"/>There, added her Ladyſhip, (for ſhe was in a pleaſant Vein) have I heard the good Man confeſs himſelf guilty of ſuch Sins, that, if true, (and by his hiding his Face with his broad-brim'd Hat, it look'd a little bad againſt him) he ought to have been hang'd on a Gallows fifty Foot high.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid, that this Over-gloomineſs was not Religion, I was perſuaded, but Conſtitution and Miſtake; and I was ſorry always when I met with it; for tho' it might betoken a pious Mind, it certainly ſhew'd a narrow one, and I fear'd did more Harm than Good.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Reflections, as I ſaid, fell from my Lady, after the Gentlemen were gone, when ſhe recounted to her dear Brother, the Entertainment, as ſhe was pleas'd to call it, I had given her: On which ſhe made high Encomiums, as did the Counteſs, and they praiſed alſo the natural Dignity which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to me, ſaying, I had taught them a way they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could have found out, to deſcend to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Servants, and augment their Reſpect and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for one at the ſame time. And, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid my Lady, you are certainly very right, to pay ſo much Regard to the young Clergyman; for that makes all he reads, and all he ſays, of greater Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy with the Auditors, facilitates the Work you have in View to bring about, and in your own Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence (for your Monarch may not always diſpenſe with you perhaps) ſtrengthens his Influences, and encourages the young Gentleman beſides.</p>

                  <head>MONDAY.</head>
                  <p>I AM to thank you, my dear Miſs, for your kind Letter, approving of my Scribble <note n="*" place="bottom">See Letter <hi>XXVIII.</hi> of this Volume.</note>. When you come to my <hi>Saturday</hi>'s and <hi>Sunday</hi>'s Accounts, I

ſhall try your Patience. But no more of that; for as you can read them, or let them alone, I am the leſs concern'd, eſpecially as they will be more indulgently receiv'd ſomewhere elſe, than they may merit; ſo that my Labour will not be wholly loſt.</p>
                  <p>I congratulate you with all my Heart, on your diſmiſſing Mr. <hi>Murray</hi>; for, beſides that ſome of his Qualities are not to be approv'd by a Lady of your Taſte and Judgment, I will never give my Conſent, that any Gentleman ſhall have the Honour of calling my Miſs) <hi>Darnford</hi> his, who can ſo eaſily reſign his Pretenſions to her, and addreſs her Siſter.</p>
                  <p>You are extremely diverting, my dear Miſs, with your Greater and Leſſer Bear-Stars, and I could not help ſhewing it to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> And what do you think the free Gentleman ſaid upon it? I am half afraid to tell you: But do, now you are ſo happily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engag'd, get Leave to come, and let us two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to be even with him for it. You are the only Lady in the World, that I would join with againſt him.</p>
                  <p>He ſaid, That your Characters of Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> and Miſs <hi>Nanny,</hi> which he called ſevere (but I won't call them ſo, without your Leave) look'd a little like pretty Spite, and as if you were ſorry the Gentleman took you at your Word.—That was what he ſaid—Pray let us puniſh him for it. Yet, he called you charming Lady, and ſaid a great deal in your Praiſe, and join'd with me, that Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> could not poſſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you, who was ſo eaſy-to part with you.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid he, I know the Sex well enough. Miſs <hi>Polly</hi> may not love Mr. <hi>Murray</hi>; yet to ſee her Siſter addreſs'd and complimented, and prefer'd to herſelf, by one whom ſhe thought ſo late in her own Power to chooſe or to refuſe, is a mortifying Thing. And young Ladies cannot bear to ſit by neglected, while two Lovers are playing Pugs Tricks with one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0272600703:271"/>Then, ſaid he, all the Preparations to Matrimony, the Cloaths to be bought, the Viſits to be paid and received, the Compliments of Friends, the buſy Novelty of the Thing, and the Day to be fixed, and all the little fooliſh Humours and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe attending a concluded Courtſhip, when <hi>one Siſter</hi> is to engroſs all the Attention and Regard, the new Equipages, and ſo forth; theſe are all Subjects of Mortification to the <hi>other,</hi> though ſhe had no great Value for the Man perhaps.</p>
                  <p>Well, but Sir, ſaid I, a Lady of Miſs <hi>Darnford</hi>'s good Senſe and good Taſte, is not to be affected by theſe Parades, and has well conſider'd the Matter, no doubt; and I dare ſay, rejoices rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines at miſſing the Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>Thus, my dear Miſs, had we a Diſpute about you. But I hope you will leave the happy Pair, for they are ſo, if they think themſelves ſo, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Sir <hi>Simon</hi> to rejoice in his accompliſh'd Son-in-Law elect, and give us your Company to <hi>London.</hi> For who would ſtay to be vex'd by that ill-natur'd Miſs <hi>Nanny,</hi> as you own you was, at your laſt writing?</p>
                  <p>But I will proceed with my Journal, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I have ſomething to tell you of a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, the Reſult of which has done me great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and given me inexpreſſible Delight: Of which in its Place.</p>
                  <p>We purſued Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Propoſal, returning ſeveral Viſits in one Day; for we have ſo polite and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Neighbourhood, that all ſeem to concur in a Deſire to make every thing eaſy to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: And, as I mentioned before, hearing Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Intention to ſet out for <hi>London,</hi> as ſoon as our noble Gueſts ſhould leave us, they diſpenſed with
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0272600703:272"/>
Formalities, being none of them ſtudious to take things amiſs, and having a general good Opinion of one another's Intentions not to diſoblige.</p>
                  <p>We came not home till Ten in the Evening, and then found a Letter directed from Sir <hi>Jacob Swyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> Uncle by the Half-Blood to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, That hearing his Niece, Lady <hi>Davers</hi> was with him, he would be here in a Day or two, being then upon his Journey, to pay a Viſit to his Nephew and Niece at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>This Gentleman is very particularly odd and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourſome, and, his eldeſt Son being next Heir to the maternal Eſtate, if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſhould have no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, has been exceedingly diſſatisfied with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing himſelf in marrying me; and would have been better pleaſed had he not married at all, perhaps.</p>
                  <p>There never was any cordial Love between Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Father and him, nor between the Uncle and Nephew and Niece; for his Poſitiveneſs, Roughneſs, and Self-intereſtedneſs too, though very rich, has made him but little agreeable to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Tempers of his Nephew and Niece; yet, when they meet, which is not above once in four or five Years, they are always very civil and oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him.</p>
                  <p>Lady <hi>Davers</hi> wonder'd what could bring him hither now; for he lives in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtirs ten Miles from home. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid, he was ſure it was not to compliment him and me on our Nuptials. No, rather, ſaid my Lady, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy himſelf if you are in a way to cut out his own Cubs. Thank God, we are, ſaid my deareſt Friend. Whenever I was ſtrongeſt ſet againſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, the only Reaſon I had to weigh againſt my
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0272600703:273"/>
Diſlike to the State was, that I was unwilling to leave ſo large a Part of my Eſtate <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>See</hi> Vol. II. p. 70.</note> to that Family.</p>
                  <p>My Dear, ſaid he to me, don't be uneaſy; but you'll ſee a Relation of mine much more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable than you can imagine: But no doubt you have heard his Character.</p>
                  <p>Ah, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> we are a Family that value ourſelves upon our Anceſtry; but upon my Word, Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> and all his Line, have nothing elſe to boaſt of. And I have been often aſhamed of my Relation to them.</p>
                  <p>No Family, I believe, my Lady, has every Body excellent in it, reply'd I: But I doubt I ſhall ſtand but poorly with Sir <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He won't dare to affront you, my Dear, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> although he'll ſay to you, and me, and my Siſter too, blunt and rough things. But he'll not ſtay above a Day or two, and we ſhall not ſee him again for ſome Years to come; ſo we'll bear with him. I am now coming to the Converſation I hinted at.</p>

                  <p>ON <hi>Tueſday,</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> came to pay his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to his kind Patron.

                  <p>When I came down, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> preſented him to me. My Friend Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> my Dear, ſaid he.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> how do you do, ſaid I? I am glad to ſee you.</p>

                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0272600703:274"/>He rejoiced, he ſaid, to ſee me look ſo well; and had long'd for an Opportunity to pay his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to his worthy Patron and me before: But had been prevented twice when he was upon the Point of ſetting out.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid, I have prevail'd upon my old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to take up his Reſidence with us, while he ſtays in theſe Parts. Do you, my Dear, ſee that every thing is made agreeable to him.</p>
                  <p>To be ſure, Sir, I will.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> being in the Houſe, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſent to deſire he would dine with us; if it were but in reſpect to a Gentleman of the ſame Cloth, who gave us his Company. And with great Modeſty he came. But neither of the Gentlemen knew how to ſpeak at firſt, before Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> who is ſo majeſtick a Lady, and has ſo majeſtick a Character too, that every one has an Awe upon them in her Preſence.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> when Dinner was over, and the Servants were withdrawn, ſaid, My Dear, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Buſineſs in Part, was to aſk my Advice as to a Living that is offer'd him, by the Earl of—, who is greatly taken with his Preaching and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>No, the Earl's is not quite ſo good as mine, and his Lordſhip would procure him a Diſpenſation to hold both. What would you adviſe, my Dear?</p>

                  <p>I am glad, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> ſaid I, that you approve of my Sentiments. You ſee they were required of me by one who has a Right to command me in every thing; otherwiſe this Matter is above my Sphere; and I have ſo much good Will to Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> that I wiſh him every thing that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to make him happy.</p>
                  <p>Well, my Dear, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> but what would you adviſe in this Caſe? The Earl propoſes, that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s preſent Living be ſupply'd by a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; to whom, no doubt, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> will be very genteel; and, as we are ſeldom or never there, his Lordſhip thinks we ſhall not be diſpleas'd with it, and inſiſts upon it, that he will propoſe it to me; as he has done.</p>
                  <p>Lord <hi>Davers</hi> ſaid, I think this may do very well, Brother. But, what pray, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> do you propoſe to allow to your Curate? Excuſe me, Sir; but I think the Clergy do ſo hardly by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generally, that they are not to be ſurpriz'd that ſome of the Laity treat them as they do.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, ſaid Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that's well obſerved; for I have heard it ſaid twenty and twenty times, If you would know how to value a Clergyman, and what he deſerves for ſpending his whole Life in the Duties of his Function, you need but form your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon the Treatment they give to one another; and 40 or 50 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, would be thought too much, even for him who does all the Labour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0272600703:276"/>Who ſays my Nephew ſpeaks not well, ſays my Lord?</p>
                  <p>Oh, ſaid my Lady, No Wonder! This is <hi>Jackey</hi>'s Peculiar. He has always ſomething to ſay againſt the Clergy. For he never lov'd them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Tutors were Clergymen; and ſince, ſaid her Ladyſhip (very ſeverely) he never got any Good from them, why ſhould they expect any from him?</p>
                  <p>Always hard upon my poor Nephew, ſaid Lord <hi>Davers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thank you, Aunt, ſaid Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Obſervation was but too true; that nothing gave greater Cauſe of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal than the Uſage ſome even of the dignified Clergy gave their Brethren: That he had always lamented it, as one of the greateſt Cauſes of the Contempt with which the Clergy are too generally treated.</p>
                  <p>He was proceeding; but Lady <hi>Davers</hi> ſaid, I am not at all ſurpriz'd at their Treatment of one another; for if a Gentleman of Education and Learning can ſo far forget what belongs to his Function, as to accept of Two Livings, when One would afford him a handſome Maintenance, it is no wonder that ſuch a one would make the moſt of it; for does he not as good as declare, that he takes it for that very Purpoſe?</p>
                  <p>I muſt not let this Argument proceed, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> without clearing my worthy Friend. He is under no Difficulty about holding the Two. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes <hi>not</hi> to do it; and, like a good Man, as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought him, is of Opinion he <hi>ought not</hi> to do it. But here is his Difficulty, and all his Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; He is very deſirous to oblige his good Friend the Earl, who is very preſſing to have him
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0272600703:277"/>
near him; but apprehending that I may take it amiſs, if he relinquiſhes my Living, he came to aſk my Advice; and after we had talked a good deal of the Matter, I told him we would refer it to Pamela, who was a kind of Caſuiſt in ſuch Matters of Equity and good Order as fell within the Compaſs of her Obſervation and Capacity: And ſo, my Dear, ſaid he, give us your free Opinion; for this is a Subject you have ſpoken your Mind to me upon once before.</p>
                  <p>I am very glad, Sir, replied I, that Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>'s own Reſolution was ſo conformable to what I wiſh'd it to be, and indeed expected from his Character; and I can more freely ſpeak my Mind upon the Occaſion, though I am but a poor Caſuiſt neither.</p>
                  <p>You remember, my Dear, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> what you obſerved to me in favour of the Clergy and their Maintenance, when we fell occaſionally upon that Subject a while ago. I found you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Point, and thought you ſpoke well upon the Subject. Let us hear your Opinion now upon it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, reply'd I, I ſay now, as I then took the Liberty to ſay, that I have ſo general a Good-will for the Function, that if my Wiſhes could have Effect, there is not one of it, but ſhould have a handſome Competency; at leaſt ſuch a one as to ſet him above Contempt. And this, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded would be a great Furtherance to the Good we expect from them, in teaching the lower Rank of People (as well as the higher) their Duties, and making them good Servants, and uſeful Members of the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0272600703:278"/>But, my Dear, you took Notice of ſome things, that would, if you can recollect them, be very <hi>apropòs</hi> to the Subject we are now upon.</p>
                  <p>I remember, Sir, ſaid I, we were talking of Impropriations. I took the Liberty to expreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a little earneſtly againſt Impropriations; and I remember you ſtopped my Mouth at once upon that Head.</p>
                  <p>As how, Siſter, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers?</hi>—Ay, as how, Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid the Counteſs?</p>
                  <p>Why, Madam, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was pleaſed to ſay, that when the Clergy would come into a Regulation for the more equal and uſeful Diſpoſition of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues that at preſent were in the Church, he would be the firſt that would bring in a Bill for reſtoring to it all that it had loſt by Impropriations and other Secularizations, and leave it upon the Publick to make Satisfaction to ſuch of the Laity as would be Sufferers by the Reſtoration.</p>
                  <p>That was not, my Dear, what I meant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Mr. <hi>B.</hi> You was particularly againſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations; which is the Point before us now.</p>
                  <p>I remember, Sir, I did ſay, that as there are ſo many Gentlemen of the Function, who have no Proviſion at all, I could not wiſh any one of it ſhould hold Two Livings; eſpecially, if they cannot perform the Duties of both, and where One would afford a tolerable Competence. Much leſs (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I took the Liberty to add) could I think it excuſable, that a Gentleman ſhould rate the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his Brother, who does <hi>every</hi> thing, ſo low, as is too frequently the Caſe, and pay himſelf ſo well, for doing <hi>nothing</hi> at all.</p>
                  <p>This is what I mean, returned Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and I thought you obſerved very well, my Dear. For
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0272600703:279"/>
my own Part, I have always been of Opinion, that the Clergy who do thus, make the beſt Excuſe that can be made for Impropriators and Lay-Patrons. For here is a Gentleman the Son of a Layman (I ſpeak to general Caſes) is ſent to the Univerſity, and takes Orders. He has Intereſt perhaps to get two or more Livings, and hires a Perſon, who is as deſerving as himſelf, but deſtitute of Friends, at a low Rate, to do the Duties of one of them. We will ſuppoſe in his Favour, that he has ſeveral Children to provide for out of theſe, and makes that his Pretence for oppreſſing the Perſon he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys to do his own Duty. Some of theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are Males, ſome Females, and not one in five of the former is brought up to the Church; and all that he ſaves for them, and gives them, out of what he ſqueezes from his unhappy Brother, is it not ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larizing, as it were, at leaſt as far as he can do it, the Revenues appropriated to the Church? And can <hi>he,</hi> whatever others may, blame an Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator for applying that Portion of the Produce of Church-Lands to <hi>his</hi> Lay-Family, which the other intends for the Lay-Family he is endeavouring to build up? Some one or two of which Impropriator's Sons may poſſibly too, in order to poſſeſs the Living in their Father's Gift, be brought up to the Church? What is the Difference, I would fain know?</p>
                  <p>If the Clergy were always to have done thus, continued Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſhould we not have wanted many Endowments and charitable Foundations, which we now have? And I am verry ſorry to have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay, that we owe ſuch Sort of Works more to the Piety of the Clergy of paſt Times than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for now, let us caſt our Eye upon the Practices of ſome of our Prelates; for who is it that looks not
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0272600703:280"/>
up firſt for Examples to that venerable Order? And we ſhall find that too many among them, ſeem more intent upon making a Family, as it is called, and thereby ſecularizing, as I obſerved, as much as they can, the Revenues of the Church, than to live up either to the ancient Hoſpitality, or with a View to thoſe Acts of Munificence, which were the Reaſon for endowing the Church with ſuch ample Revenues, as it once had, and ſtill has, were it not ſo unequally diſtributed, and in ſo few Hands.</p>
                  <p>But, dear Sir, ſaid I, what a ſad Hardſhip do the inferior Clergy labour under all this Time?— To be oppreſſed and kept down by their Brethren and the Laity too? This is hard indeed—'Tis pity, methinks, this, at leaſt, could not be remedied.</p>
                  <p>It will hardly ever be done, my Dear. The Evil lies deep; 'tis in human Nature, and when that can be mended, it will be better; but I ſee not how it can be expected, while thoſe who have moſt Influence to procure the Redreſs, are moſt intereſted to prevent it: And the Views of others, aſpiring to the ſame Power and Intereſt, make too many wiſh to have things left as they are; although they have no preſent Benefit by it. And thoſe would join in a Cry of the Church's Danger, were the Legiſlature to offer at a Redreſs.</p>
                  <p>'Tis pity, Sir, ſaid I, the Convocation are not permitted to ſit. They would, perhaps, undertake this Province, and ſeveral others for the Benefit of the whole Body of the Clergy; and I ſhould think ſuch Regulations would come beſt from them.</p>
                  <p>So it is, my Dear, would they employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Deliberations in ſuch good Works. But 'tis a ſad Thing to conſider, that there is little Good to be expected from Bodies of Men in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0272600703:281"/>
general; for altho' an Individual cares not to pull down upon himſelf the Odium of a bad or unpopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Action, yet when there are many to ſhare it among them, I ſee not that they ſtand upon it. But far be it from me to ſay this with a View to Convocations <hi>as</hi> Convocations. I ſpeak what is but too generally the Caſe in all Bodies of Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether Clergy or Laity. And let us look into the greater or leſſer Corporations and Societies throughout the Kingdom, and you'll find, if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe a poor Witiciſm, that Bodies are really <hi>Bodies,</hi> and act too often as if they had no <hi>Souls</hi> among them.</p>
                  <p>I hope, Sir, ſaid the Counteſs, that when you judge thus hardly of Bodies, you include the two ſupreme Bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt not,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi>—I know theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Gentlemen (looking at Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> and Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>) will tell me, <hi>ſpeak Evil of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of thy People.</hi>—But I wiſh I could always defend, what I am loth at any time to cenſure. But were you to read, or attend to the Debates in both Houſes, which ſometimes happen in Caſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſelf-evident, you would find it impoſſible not to regret, that you are now and then under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to join with the Minority; as well in your Houſe, Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> as in ours.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh Brother, reply'd his Lordſhip, I could differ from you with Reaſon: But this always <hi>was,</hi> and, I fear, always <hi>will be</hi> ſo, more or leſs in every Seſſion.</p>
                  <p>But, to return to our firſt Subject, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> You know, my Dear, how much Pleaſure I take to hear your Opinion in Caſes of natural Equity: And you muſt tell us freely, what you would adviſe your Friend Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0272600703:282"/>And muſt I, Sir, ſpeak my Mind before ſo many Better Judges?</p>
                  <p>Yes, <hi>Siſter,</hi> ſaid her Ladyſhip, (a Name ſhe is now pleaſed to give me freely before Strangers, after her dear Brother's Example, who is kindeſt, tho' always kind, at ſuch Times) you <hi>muſt</hi>; if I may be allow'd to ſay <hi>muſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why then, ſaid I, I beg leave to ask Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> one Queſtion; that is, Whether his preſent Pariſhioners do not reſpect and eſteem him, in that particular Manner, which I think every Body muſt, who knows his Worth?</p>
                  <p>I am very happy, Madam, in the Good-Will of all my Pariſhioners, and have great Acknowlege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make for their Civilities to me.</p>
                  <p>I don't doubt, ſaid I, but it will be the ſame where-ever you go; for, bad as the World is, a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and good Clergyman will never fail of Reſpect. But, Sir, if you think your Miniſtry among them is attended with good Effects; if they eſteem your Perſon with a Preference, and liſten to your Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines with Attention; methinks, for <hi>their</hi> Sakes, 'tis pity to leave them, were the Living of <hi>leſs</hi> Value, as it is of <hi>more</hi> than the other. For how many People are there who can benefit by one Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Preaching, rather than another's; altho', poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, the one's Abilities may be no way inferior to the other's? There is a great deal in a <hi>Delivery,</hi> as it is called, in a Way, a Manner, a Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to engage People's Attention and Eſteem; and as you are already in Poſſeſſion of their Eſteem, you are ſure to do much of the Good you aim and wiſh to do. For where the Flock loves the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, all his Work is eaſy, and more than half done; and without that, let him have the Tongue
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0272600703:283"/>
of an Angel, and let him live the Life of a Saint, he will be heard with Indifference, and, oftentimes, as his Subject may be, with Diſguſt.</p>
                  <p>I pauſed here, but every one being ſilent, As to the Earl's Friendſhip, Sir, continued I, you are beſt Judge what Force that ought to have upon you; and what I have mention'd wou'd be the only Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty with me, were I in Mr. <hi>William</hi>'s Caſe. To be ſure it will be an high Obligation upon his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſo he ought to think it, that you quit a better Living to oblige him. And he will be bound in Honour to make it up to you. For I am far from thinking, that a prudent Regard to worldly Intereſt misbecomes the Character of a good Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and I wiſh all ſuch were ſet above the World, for their own Sakes, as well as for the Sakes of their Hearers, ſince Independency gives a Man Reſpect, beſides the Power of doing Good, which will inhance that Reſpect, ſtrengthen his Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and, of conſequence, give greater Efficacy to his Doctrines.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs mentioned hereupon, the Saying of Dr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> who was beheaded in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. becauſe he would not own the King's Supremacy: This Prelate being offer'd a richer Biſhoprick, he would not accept of it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"He looked upon his Biſhoprick as his Wife, and he ſhould not think it excuſable to part with his Wife becauſe ſhe was poor."</q>
This brought ſo many Reflections upon the frequent Tranſlations, and the Earneſtneſs with which richer Biſhopricks were ſought after, that I was very ſorry to hear, or think there was Occaſion for them. And I did take the Liberty to ſay, that, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0272600703:284"/>
the Fault was in human Nature; and tho' it was an inexcuſable one, perhaps we that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd them, might find it hard, in their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to reſiſt the Temptation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid, He wiſh'd, for the Sake of the Clergy in general, that there was a Law againſt Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that all the Biſhopricks in <hi>England,</hi> were made equal in Revenue: For, do we not ſee, ſaid he, that the Prelates, almoſt to a Man, vote with Power? And, by this means, contribute not a little to make themſelves and the whole Body of a Clergy, ſo numerous, and ſo deſerving too, as that of the Church of England, a By-word to Free-thinkers of all Denominations, who are ever ready to take Occaſion to malign them and their venerable Order.</p>
                  <p>Would you not, aſked Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> have the two Primacies diſtinguiſhed in Revenue?</p>
                  <p>No, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> the Diſtinction of Dignity and Precedence would be enough, if not too much; for where there is but one Pope, the whole College of Cardinals, Seventy in Number, are always look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to, and gaping after the Chair: And I would have no Temptations laid in the Way of good Men to forfeit their Characters, and weaken their Influences, which are of ſo much Conſequence for Example-ſake, to the Publick Weal.</p>
                  <p>I think, ſaid Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> there was ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the Celibacy of the Clergy in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church at firſt; altho' the Inconveniencies ariſing from it, are too many, and too obvious, to wiſh the Reſtraint ſo general. For the Proviſion for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Children, furniſhes ſo natural and ſo laudable a Pretence to a Clergyman to lay up all he
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0272600703:285"/>
can for them, that their Characters ſuffer not a little on that Account.</p>
                  <p>If we look round us, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and ſee how many good and worthy Families are ſprung from the Clergy; and look abroad, and ſee what are too often the Effects of Celibacy in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the Scandal, worſe than what we complain of, ever thrown upon them, even by Bigots of their own Communion, we ſhall have ſufficient Reaſon to condemn the Celibacy which that Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins. Beſides, a bad Mind, an oppreſſive or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Nature, will be the ſame, whether marry'd or ſingle: For have we not ſeen to what a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Heighth Nepotiſm has been carried in that Church? And has not a Pope of a private and narrow Spirit, done as much for his Nephews and Nieces (and perhaps nearer Relations under thoſe Names) as he could have done for his Sons and Daughters? So ſtill <hi>here</hi> too, we muſt reſolve all into that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sewer of Iniquity, Human Nature; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That a truly good Man will not do a bad Thing upon any the neareſt and moſt affecting Conſiderations; and that a bad Man will never want a Pretence to diſplay his evil Qualities, nor Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers neither (if he has Power) to defend him, for the worſt he can do.</p>
                  <p>I well remember the Argument, when I was at <hi>Rome,</hi> uſed to the Pope, on ſuch an Occaſion. His Holineſs declar'd againſt Nepotiſm, ſaying, That he would never look upon the Revenues of the Church, as the Patrimony of his private Family; and forbad his numerous Relations, who, on his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, ſwarm'd about him, with Faces as hungry, as if they were ſo many <hi>North-Britons,</hi> travelling Southward for Preferment—(that was Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0272600703:286"/>
Word, ſpoken pleaſantly) to think of him in any other Light, than that of the common Father of all his People; and as having no other Relation but Merit.</p>
                  <p>This was ſetting out well, you'll ſay; but what was the Event?—Why, two thirds of his Relations ruſhed into Orders directly; and it was not long, before Paraſites were found, to repreſent to the Holy Father, that it was a Sin, to deprive the Church of ſo many excellent Props and Buttreſſes; and that for the Good of the Publick, he ought to prefer them to the firſt Dignities; ſo, that the good Man, overcome with their Reaſons, and loth to continue in ſo great a Sin, grac'd the Cardinalate with one, the Epiſcopate with half a Dozen; and the richeſt Abbacies with a Score or two; and the Emperor having occaſion to make Intereſt with his Holineſs, found Merit enough in ſome of the Lay-Relations, to create them Princes and Counts of the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, ſaid I, (for I am always ſorry to hear things ſaid to the Diſcredit of the Clergy, becauſe I think it is of publick Concern that we venerate the Function, tho' not the Failings of Particulars); have I not been a ſilent Witneſs, that you have made the ſame Obſervations on a Miniſter of State, who, tho' he ſhall be perhaps the firſt to blame this Diſpoſition in a Clergyman, will be equally ready to practiſe it himſelf, to Relations and Children, full as worthleſs, to the Excluſion of the Worthy? —So that, Sir, this is all Human Nature ſtill; and ſhould we not be tender in our Cenſures of the one, when we are ſo ready to acquit the other?</p>
                  <p>There's this Difference, Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs: From the one we expect a better Example;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0272600703:287"/>
from the other, no Example fit to be followed. And this is one Reaſon that makes a Firſt Miniſter generally ſo hated a Thing, becauſe he reſolves all Conſiderations into Self, and is beloved by no Body, but thoſe, to whom he gives the Overflowings of ſuch Benefits as he has not Relations enough to heap them upon.</p>
                  <p>Well, Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> ſaid I, if I may be allow'd to be ſo ſerious, does not this ſhew the Excellency of the Prayer we are taught by the ſupreme Teacher, and that Part of it, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation?</hi>—For it ſeems too natural a Conſequence, that no ſooner are we tempted, but we <hi>deliver up our ſelves to Evil.</hi>—Right, Siſter, ſaid Lord <hi>Davers</hi>; and this ends in Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s <hi>human Nature</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>What remains then, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> but that we take the World as we find it? Give Praiſe to the Good, Diſpraiſe to the Bad; and every one try to mend <hi>one?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I wiſh, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſo over-tender are many good Clergymen of the Failings they would not be guilty of, in their Brethren, that we ſhould avoid diſpleaſing them, if they were to know the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this Converſation, tho' we are all ſo well-diſpoſed to reverence their Function.</p>
                  <p>I hope otherwiſe, ſaid Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>; for it is but giving <hi>due</hi> Praiſe and Diſpraiſe, as my Lady ſays; and were evil Actions to go uncenſur'd, good ones would loſe their Reward, and Vice by being put upon a Foot with Virtue in this Life, would meet with too much Countenance.</p>
                  <p>But give me leave, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a little in the Matter we have departed from, that of the Curate and Diſpenſation; and when I have deliver'd my Sentiments, I inſiſt upon it, that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0272600703:288"/>
Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> will as freely give us hers, as if I had been ſilent.</p>
                  <p>Diſpenſations are uſual Things. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> may pay a young Gentleman handſomely; and the Cenſure we have paſs'd, is only upon ſuch as do not. To a young Man at firſt ſetting out, a good Curacy will be very acceptable. If he has Merit, it will put him in a Way of ſhewing it, and he may raiſe himſelf by it. If he has not, he will not deſerve more. And Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> may marry, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, and have a Family to provide for. His Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities may not always be the ſame: The Earl may die, and he ſhould be excuſed to make the beſt Uſe of his Intereſt and Favour, for the very Reaſon Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> gave, that, as he is a good Man, it will ſtrengthen his Influences: And, come, Brother, you know I am always for preſcribing! Here is a worthy young Gentleman in our Eye, that won't take it amiſs to begin with a Curacy: And you ſhall give <hi>your</hi> Diſpenſation, previous to the legal one, on Condition, that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> will permit you to preſent his Curate; and thus all will be ſolv'd.</p>
                  <p>Both the Gentlemen bow'd—and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> was going to ſpeak: But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid, Take my Siſter at her Word, <hi>Pamela,</hi> and if you have any thing to ſay to this Scheme, ſpeak it freely, as if her Ladyſhip had been ſilent; for, I perceive, by your downcaſt Eye, and Silence, you could ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if you would.</p>
                  <p>Ay, pray do, ſaid my Lady. I love to hear you ſpeak. You always make me think of ſomething I had not conſider'd before.</p>
                  <p>I am very loth to ſay anything on ſo nice a Subject. Indeed it would not become me. There is ſo much
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0272600703:289"/>
Generoſity and Benevolence in my good Lady's Scheme, that I ought not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ought not!</hi> ſaid my deareſt Friend, interrupting me, None of your <hi>ought nots</hi>; I know you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways forming in your Mind Notions of Right and Wrong, in the common Caſes of Life. Let us therefore have your Opinion in this Matter more fully than you have hitherto given it, and deliver it too without Heſitation, and with that Eaſe and Freedom, that are born with you; for I can tell you, that when, thro' the Corruptions of Human Nature, we loſe the Diſtinction of Right and Wrong, I know not where we can better apply ourſelves, than to ſuch as you, to recover them.</p>
                  <p>I bow'd, and ſaid, If you will have it ſo, Sir, it muſt be ſo; and I will then beſpeak all your kind Allowances, caſting my Eye around me, to each, and tell you all I think upon this Matter; and when I have done, ſubmit my poor Sentiments, as becomes me, to your ſuperior Judgments.</p>
                  <p>Thus then I would ſay—Pardon me, my Lady, for taking your Ladyſhip's Words for my Theme, as I remember them; and hardly any thing falls from your Ladyſhip that I do not remember— <hi>That Diſpenſations are uſual Things.</hi>—I am ſure, I am going to diſplay my Ignorance, becauſe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of their Original or Deſign, I muſt preſume them to be very ancient in this Kingdom, and introduced only when there were fewer Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen than Benefices. Was there ever ſuch a Time?</p>
                  <p>They ſmil'd—Nay, now, you would command me, Sir, to ſpeak, when I needed to do nothing elſe to expoſe my ſelf. There was a Time, as I have read, that there were ſo few Scholars, that the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0272600703:290"/>
Benefit of Clergy was allow'd to ſome ſort of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals who could do no more than read, becauſe the Commonwealth could ſo ill ſpare learned Men. —And might not there be a Time then, when Diſpenſations were allowed to worthy Men, becauſe it was difficult to find enow of ſuch as deſerv'd that Character, to fill the Church Preferments?</p>
                  <p>Tell us, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> whether you do not intend this as a Satire upon the Practice, or is it really your pretty Ignorance, that has made you pronounce one of the ſevereſt Cenſures upon it, that could be thought of?</p>
                  <p>I ſmiled, and ſaid, Indeed, Sir, I think only ſome ſuch Reaſon, or a worſe, muſt be the Original of Diſpenſations; for is it right that one Gentleman ſhall have two or three Livings, the Duties of no more than one of which he can perſonally attend, while ſo many are deſtitute of Bread, almoſt, and expoſed to Contempt, the too frequent Companion of Poverty? And what though Cuſtom may have ſanctified it, to be ſure that is all that can; and a good Man will not do all he may do, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring a Penalty, becauſe there is in every thing a Right and a Wrong; and becauſe, be the Cuſtom what it will, a Man ſhould regulate his Actions by his Conſcience and the Golden Rule.</p>
                  <p>My good Lady ſays, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> may pay a Gentleman handſomely: I don't doubt but Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> would; and this, I am ſorry to ſay it, would be doing what is not ſo often done as one would wiſh. But may I be permitted to aſk, For <hi>what</hi> would he pay the Gentleman handſomely?—Why for doing that Duty for him, which in Conſcience and Honour he ought to do himſelf, and which, when he takes Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0272600703:291"/>
and Induction, he engages ſolemnly to do? And pray, excuſe me, my Dear Every-body— that was my fooliſh Word, which made them ſmile—To what End is all this?—Only, that the Gentleman who does all the Labour in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, ſhall live upon 30, 40, or 50<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> more or leſs, while the Gentleman who has <hi>beſt</hi> nothing but <hi>beſt</hi> Intereſt, (another of my fooliſh Phraſes) ſhall receive twice, and perhaps three times the Sum for doing nothing at all. Can any Diſpenſation, my dear Friends, make this a juſt or equitable thing? Indeed if the Living be ſo poor, as too many of them are, that a Man cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably and creditably ſubſiſt without putting Two poor ones together to make One tolerable one, that is another Thing. But pray now, my good Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> excuſe me, if Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> can live on a Curacy of 40 or 50<hi>l.</hi> a Year, cannot another Gentleman live, unleſs his Rectory or Vicarage bring him 2 or 300? Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> may marry as well as Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>; and both, I believe, will find God's Providence a better Reliance, than the richeſt Benefice in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A good Curacy, no doubt, continued I, may be a comfortable thing at ſetting out to a young Gentleman: But if here be a Rectory or Vicarage, of 200 <hi>l.</hi> a Year for Example, (for if it be of no more Value than a good Curacy, he muſt be content) is not that 200<hi>l.</hi> a Year the Reward for doing ſuch and ſuch Labour? And if this be the ſtated Hire for this Labour, to ſpeak in the Scripture Phraſe, <hi>is not the Labourer worthy of his Hire?</hi> Or is he that does <hi>not</hi> labour to go away with the greateſt Part of it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0272600703:292"/>If the Gentleman, my Lady is pleaſed to ſay, has Merit, this Curacy may put him in the way of ſhewing it. But does the Manifeſtation of Merit, and the Reward of it always go together?—</p>
                  <p>My Lady is ſo good as to obſerve:—But may I, Madam, be excuſed?—</p>
                  <p>Proceed, proceed, Child!—I ſhall only have a Care of what I ſay before you for the future, that's all.</p>
                  <p>And I too, ſaid Mr. <hi>H.</hi>— which made them ſmile.</p>
                  <p>Nay, now, my Lady.—</p>
                  <p>Proceed, I tell you—I only wonder, as my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has ſaid, on another Occaſion, where thou gotteſt all theſe equitable Notions.</p>
                  <p>My Lady is ſo good as to obſerve, proceeded I, (for they were pleaſed to be attentive) that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſhould make uſe of his Opportunities. I know her Ladyſhip ſpeaks this rather in generous Indulgence to the uſual Practice, than what always ought to be the chief Conſideration; for if the Earl ſhould die, may not ſome other Friend ariſe to a Gentleman of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Merit?</p>
                  <p>As to ſtrengthning of a good Man's Influence, which is a Point always to be wiſh'd, I would not ſay ſo much as I have done, if I had not heard Mr. <hi>Longman</hi> ſay, and I am ſure I heard it with great Pleaſure, that the Benefice Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſo worthily enjoys, is a clear 250 <hi>l.</hi> a Year.</p>
                  <p>But after all, does Happineſs to a Gentleman, a Scholar, a Philoſopher, reſt in a greater or leſſer Income?—Does it not rather reſt in a happy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, or Mediocrity? Suppoſe my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had 5000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year added to his preſent large Income, would that increaſe his Happineſs! That
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0272600703:293"/>
it would add to his Cares, is no Queſtion; but could that Addition give him one ſingle Comfort which he has not already? And if the dear Gentleman had 2 or 3000 leſs, might he be leſs happy on that Account? No, ſurely, for it would render a greater Prudence on my humble Part neceſſary, and a nearer Inſpection and greater Frugality on his own; and he muſt be contented (if he did not, as now, perhaps, lay up every Year) ſo long as he lived within his Income—And who will ſay, that the Obligation to greater Prudence, and Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, is a Miſfortune?</p>
                  <p>The Competency, therefore, the Golden Mean, is the Thing; and I have often conſidered the Matter, and endeavoured to ſquare my Actions by that Conſideration. For a Perſon (I have this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dear Sir, from that Manuſcript Poem you was pleaſed to ſhew me, of not preferring People above their native Condition, and which has been an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Leſſon to me: For a Perſon, I was going to ſay) who being not born to an Eſtate, is not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a Competency, will know no Limits to his Deſires. Such a one that an Acquiſition of 100 or 200 <hi>l.</hi> a Year will not ſatisfy, will not ſit down contented with any Sum. Although he may propoſe to himſelf at a Diſtance, that ſuch and ſuch an Acquiſition will be the Height of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; yet he will, as he approaches to that, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance upon himſelf farther and farther—and know no Bounds, till the natural one is forced upon him, and his Life and his Views end together.</p>
                  <p>Now let me humbly beg Pardon of you all, Ladies and Gentlemen, ſaid I, turning my Eye to each; but moſt of you, my good Lady, whoſe Obſervations I have made ſo free with. If <hi>you</hi> can
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0272600703:293"/>
forgive me, it will be an Inſtance of your Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I may hope for, but hardly can expect. Will you, my dear Lady, ſaid I, and laid my Hand upon her Ladyſhip's, in a ſupplicatory Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for ſhe ſat next me?</p>
                  <p>I think <hi>not,</hi> ſaid her Ladyſhip. I think I <hi>ought</hi> not.—Should I, Brother? Can I, my Lord?— Ought I, my Lady Counteſs?—Brother, Brother, if you have been in any Degree contributing to the Excellency of this—what ſhall I call her? How cunningly do you act, to make her imbibe your Notions, and then utter them with ſuch Advantage, that you have the ſecret Pride to find your own Sentiments praiſed from her Mouth? But I will forgive you both, he it as it will; for I am ſure, outdone as I am, in Thought, Word, and Deed, and by ſo young a Gypſey—that was her Word; it is by one that would outdo every body elſe, as well as me; only I would except your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip—None of your Exceptions, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Counteſs—I know not, in ſo young a Lady, whether I ſhould moſt envy or admire her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence.</p>
                  <p>Well, but ſince I have the Pleaſure, ſaid I, to find myſelf forgiven, may I be indulged a few Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Prattle more? only juſt to obſerve, that the State of the Caſe I have given, is but one Side of the Queſtion; that which a good Clergyman, in my humble Opinion, would chuſe to act. But when we come to the other Side, what it would be kind we of the Laity ſhould think and act by them, that is another thing. For when we think of the Hardſhips the Clergy lie under, more than almoſt any other Body of Men, we ſhall ſee they are intitled to better Uſage than they often meet with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0272600703:295"/>Here, in the firſt Place, a Youth is ſent to the Univerſity, after a painful Courſe to qualify him for it. He endangers his Health, and impairs his Conſtitution by hard Study, and a ſedentary Life; and after he has paſſed ſuch a Number of Years, he is admitted into Orders, perhaps gets a ſmall Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, turns Tutor, a painful Imployment, and his Education having been deſigned for all his Portion, and that expended in it, he at laſt, by Intereſt or Favour, gets a Curacy or little Living of 40, 50, or 60 <hi>l.</hi> a Year; if leſs, ſo much the worſe; and is obliged to maintain himſelf in a genteel Appearance out of that, and be ſubject not ſeldom to the Jeſts of Buffoons and Rakes at a great Man's Table, where the <hi>Parſon</hi> is too often the Butt to receive the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed witty Shafts of ſuch as can allow themſelves to ſay any thing. If he marries, which poſſibly too he is kept from, contrary to his Wiſhes, of all Men he is the leaſt to follow his own Liking; ſince Prudence too often obliges him to take the Perſon his Inclination would not.</p>
                  <p>If Children follow, what melancholy Views has he of providing for them, did not his ſtrong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance on Providence exerciſe his Faith againſt worldly Appearance?</p>
                  <p>Then has he too often to contend for his Dues, the Produce of his poor Income, with churliſh and ignorant Spirits, whom his Function would make him wiſh to ſmooth and inſtruct; who, though they farm and pay to the Landlord for no more than nine Tenths of the Lands they occupy, hardly think it a Sin to cheat the Parſon of his Tythe; who, however, has the ſame Right to it by the Laws of the Land, as the Gentleman has to the Eſtate, or the Tenant to the Produce of his Farm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:0272600703:296"/>This obliges the poor Gentleman to live in a State of War among a People with whom both his Duty and Inclination would make him deſirous to cultivate a good Underſtanding. And what Benefits can reſult from his Miniſtry in ſuch a Situation; when the People to be inſtructed look upon him as an Invader of their Subſtance, at the very Time that they are robbing him of what is legally his?</p>
                  <p>In the next Place, I preſume to think, that the Clergy are too much looked upon by ſome as a detached Body, as I may ſay, from the reſt of the People, and as Perſons acting upon a ſeparate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt quite oppoſite to that of the Laity: When, poſſibly, that very Churl, who refuſes them their Right, or would cheat them of it, has a View to bring up one of his Family to the Church, and hopes to get him provided for out of its Revenues. And are not the Clergy, moreover, the Fathers, the Sons, the Uncles, the Brothers of the Laity, who ſhall ſet themſelves againſt their Maintenance? And muſt their Education debar them of thoſe Comforts, which it better qualifies them to enjoy, and which it incapacitates them any other way to procure?</p>
                  <p>What Opportunity have not the Laity in general, of all Degrees and Ranks, to make their Lives eaſy and happy, to what the Clergy have? Here is a middling Family, with three or four Sons: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Father's Circumſtances will allow him to bring up one to the <hi>Law:</hi> What Opportunities has <hi>he,</hi> unenvied, to make a Fortune? Another is brought up to <hi>Trade:</hi> If he has but tolerable Succeſs in the World, in what Eaſe and Affluence does he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf, and provide for his Family? The
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0272600703:297"/>
                     <hi>Phyſick Line,</hi> what Fortunes are not raiſed in that? And no body envies any of theſe. But the Son, whoſe Inclination ſhall lead him perhaps <hi>beſt</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and <hi>moſt</hi> to require, an eaſy and comfortable Subſiſtence, and who ought wholly to appropriate himſelf to the Duties of his Function, is grudged, envied, and treated as if he were not a Son of the ſame Family, and had not a natural Right and Stake in the ſame Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>There are, 'tis true, Preferments, and ſome great ones, and Honours too, in the Church; but how few, compared to the Numbers of the Clergy, or to thoſe Livings which are ſo poor as can hardly ſet a Man above Penury and Contempt?—And how are thoſe few ingroſs'd by the Deſcendants or Dependants of the Rich and Powerful? And, what by Commendams, Diſpenſations, and ſuch-like Contrivances, how does one Man of Intereſt and Addreſs ſwallow up the Proviſion which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for ſeveral, as deſerving, perhaps, at leaſt, as himſelf?—For, my good Lady, (you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given me, and muſt not be diſpleaſed) a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Friends <hi>may die off,</hi> and he muſt, you know, <hi>make the beſt Uſe of his Opportunities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O you dear Sauce-box, as my Brother calls you!—How dare you, by that arch pretty Look, triumph over me thus?—Let me, Brother, give her a Slap for this!—I'm ſure ſhe deſerves it.</p>
                  <p>I think ſhe is a little inſolent indeed, Lady <hi>Davers.</hi> — But to the Caſe in Hand. There is ſo much Truth in what <hi>Pamela</hi> ſays, of the Hardſhips to which the Clergy, the inferior Clergy particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, are ſubjected, that I wonder any Gentleman who can chuſe for himſelf, and has no probable
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0272600703:298"/>
Proſpects, ſhould enter into Orders, under ſuch Diſcouragements.</p>
                  <p>I humbly conceive, Sir, ſaid I, that there can be but one <hi>good</hi> Inducement, and that is what the Apoſtle hints at in the Words — <hi>If in</hi> this Life <hi>only we have Hope, we are of all Men moſt miſerable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſo much as this is their Motive, ſo much are they intitled to that better Hope; and may that better Hope never deceive them!</p>
                  <p>But I have the Pleaſure to acquaint this Company, that I had a mind only to hear what <hi>Pamela,</hi> who, as I hinted, talked to me learnedly on this very Subject a few Days ago, would ſay, when ſhe came Face to Face, to her two worthy Friends, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> and Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> (and ſo I deſired Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> would let her run on, if I could ſet her into the Subject)—elſe my old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance was reſolved not to hold both Livings, ſince <hi>either,</hi> he was ſo good as to ſay, would afford him as handſome a Proviſion, as he wiſhed for; his only Difficulty being about obliging the Earl, or whether he ſhould not diſoblige me, if he complied with that Nobleman's Requeſt.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> this is the very Caſe; and after what I have heard from your Ladyſhip, (ſo he call'd me) I would not, for the World, have been of another Mind, nor have put it upon any other Foot than I did.</p>
                  <p>You are a good Gentleman, ſaid I; and I have ſuch an Opinion of your Worthineſs, and the Credit you do your Character, that I would ſooner ſuſpect my own Judgment, and ſo I ought, than yours. But pray, Sir, what, may I aſk? have you determined to do?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0272600703:299"/>Why, Madam, reply'd he, I am ſtagger'd in that too, by the Obſervation your Ladyſhip made, that where a Man has the Love of his Pariſhioners, he ought not to think of leaving them.</p>
                  <p>Elſe, Sir, I find, you had rather inclined to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Earl, though the Living be of <hi>leſs</hi> Value! This is very noble, Sir; it is more than generous.</p>
                  <p>My Dear, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I'll tell you (for Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Modeſty will not let him ſpeak it before all the Company) what <hi>is</hi> his Motive, and a worthy one you'll ſay it is. Excuſe me, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>— (for the reverend Gentleman bluſh'd).</p>
                  <p>The Earl has of late Years—we all know his Character—given himſelf up to Carouſing, and he will ſuffer no Man to go from his Table ſober. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> has taken the Liberty to expoſtulate, as became his Function, with his Lordſhip on this Subject, and upon ſome other Irregularities, in ſo agreeable a manner, that the Earl has taken a great Liking to him, and promiſes, that he will ſuffer his Reaſonings to have an Effect upon him, and that he ſhall reform his whole Houſhold, if he will come and live near him, and regulate his Table by his own Example.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs is a very good Lady, and privately preſſes Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> to oblige the Earl: And this is our worthy Friend's main Inducement; with the Hope, which I ſhould not forget to mention, that he has, of preſerving untainted the Morals of the two young Gentlemen, the Earl's Sons, who, he fears, will be carried away by the Force of ſuch an Example: And he thinks, as the Earl's Living has fallen, mine, probably, will be better ſupplied than the Earl's, if he, as he kindly offers, gives it me back again; otherwiſe the Earl, as he apprehends,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0272600703:300"/>
will find out for his, ſome Gentleman, if ſuch an one can be found, as will rather further, than ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his own Irregularities; as was the unhappy Caſe of the laſt Incumbent.</p>
                  <p>Well, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> and ſo ſaid the Counteſs, we ſhall always have the higheſt Reſpect for Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> for a Conduct ſo genteel and ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. But, Brother, will you, and will you, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> put this whole Affair, in all its Parts, into Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>'s Hands, ſince you have ſuch Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>both</hi> of you, of her Rectitude of Thinking and Acting?</p>
                  <p>With all my Heart, Madam, replied Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>; and I ſhall be proud of ſuch a Direction.</p>
                  <p>What ſay <hi>you,</hi> Brother? You are to ſuppoſe the Living in your own Hands again; will you leave the whole Matter to my <hi>Siſter</hi> here?</p>
                  <p>Come, my Dear, ſays Mr. <hi>B.</hi> let us hear how you'd wiſh it to be order'd. I know you have not need of one Moment's Conſideration, when once you are Miſtreſs of a Point.</p>
                  <p>Nay, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> that is not the Thing. I repeat my Demand: Shall it be as Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> lays it out, or not?</p>
                  <p>This is a weighty Matter, my good Siſter; and bad as I have been, I think Patrons are accountable, in a great meaſure, for the Characters of the Perſons they preſent; and I do aſſure you, that had I twenty Livings in my Gift, I ſhould think I ought not to prefer my Brother to any one of them, if his Morals and Character were not likely to do Honour to the Church, as well as to my Preſentation. And I expected to hear from <hi>Pamela,</hi> when ſhe was enumerating the Hardſhips of the Clergy, of that ſcandalous Practice of ſome Patrons, who rob the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0272600703:301"/>
regularly-bred Clergymen, by puſhing into Orders ſome Kinſman, or Friend, or Friend's Kinſman or Friend, when a Living falls in, let his Character or Qualifications be ever ſo faulty and defective. I could name you ſeveral ſuch Inſtances, that ought to make the Ordainers, as well as the Ordained, <hi>bluſh</hi>; as (were I to borrow one of <hi>Pamela</hi>'s ſerious Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, I would ſay) it will one Day make them both <hi>tremble,</hi> when they come to give an Account of the Truſts committed to them.</p>
                  <p>Well, ſays my Lady, I have a noble Brother, that's true. What Pity you ever were wicked at all! But, come, and laid her Hand upon mine, this ſame good Girl will be a Bleſſing to you: Nay, why ſay I, <hi>will</hi> be? ſhe <hi>is</hi>; and the greateſt that mortal Man can receive.— But ſtill I muſt have you put this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>'s Hands.</p>
                  <p>Conditionally I will — Provided I cannot give ſatisfactory Reaſons, why I <hi>ought not</hi> to conform to her Opinion; for this, as I ſaid, is a Point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with me; and I made it ſo, when I preſented Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> to the Living; and have not been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in that Preſentation.</p>
                  <p>To be ſure, ſaid I, that is very reaſonable, Sir; and on that Condition, I ſhall the leſs heſitate to ſpeak my Mind, becauſe I ſhall be ſure of being in no Danger to commit an irreparable Error.</p>
                  <p>I know well, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> added Mr. <hi>B.</hi> the Power your Sex have over ours, and their ſubtle Tricks; and ſo will never be drawn in, in my weakeſt Moments, to make a blindfold Promiſe. There h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve been ſeveral Inſtances, both in ſacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Story, of Miſchiefs done by ſuch Surprizes: So you muſt allow me to ſuſpect myſelf, when I know the dear Slut's Power over me, and have been taught by the inviolable Regard ſhe pays to her own Word,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0272600703:302"/>
to value mine.—And now, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſpeak all that's in your Heart to ſay.</p>
                  <p>Well, Sir, ſaid I, with your <hi>requiſite</hi> Condition in my Eye, I will. But let me ſee, that I ſtate the Matter right. And preparative to it, pray, Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi> tho' you have not been long in Poſſeſſion of this Living, yet may-be you can compute what it is likely, by what you know of it, to bring in, clear?</p>
                  <p>Madam, ſaid he, by the beſt Calculation I can make, (I thank you for it, good Sir) it may, one Year with another, be reckoned at 300 l. <hi>per Annum:</hi> It is the beſt Living within twenty Miles of it, having been improved within theſe two laſt Years.</p>
                  <p>If it was 500 l. and would make you happier, — (for <hi>that,</hi> Sir, is the thing) I ſhould wiſh it you, ſaid I, and think it ſhort of your Merits. But pray, Sir, what is the Earl's Living valued at?</p>
                  <p>At about 220 l. Madam.</p>
                  <p>Well then, reply'd I, very pertly, I believe now I have it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> for Motives moſt excellently wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Function, inclines to ſurrender up to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> his Living of 300 l. <hi>per Annum,</hi> and to accept of the Earl's Living of 220 l. <hi>per Annum.</hi> Dear Sir, I am going to be very bold; but under <hi>your</hi> Condition nevertheleſs:—Let the Gentleman to whom you ſhall preſent the Living of <hi>F.</hi> allow 80 l. <hi>per Annum</hi> out of it to Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> till the Earl's Favour ſhall make up the Difference to him, and no longer.—And—but I dare not name the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: —For how, dear Sir, were I to be ſo bold, ſhall I part with my Chaplain?</p>
                  <p>Admirable! moſt admirable! ſaid Lord and Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> in the ſame Words. The Counteſs praiſed the Deciſion too; and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> with his Let me be hang'd, and his 'Fore Gads,—and ſuch Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions natural to him, made <hi>his</hi> Plaudits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:0272600703:303"/>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid, He could wiſh with all his Heart it might be ſo; and Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> was ſo abaſh'd and ſurpris'd, he could not hold up his Head;—but Joy danced in his ſilent Countenance for all that.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> having heſitated a few Minutes, Lady <hi>Davers</hi> called out for his Objection, or Conſent, according to Condition; and he ſaid, I cannot ſo ſoon determine as that prompt Slut did. I'll withdraw one Minute.</p>
                  <p>He did ſo, as I found afterwards, to adviſe, like the conſiderate and genteel Spirit he poſſeſſes, with Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> whom he beckon'd out, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether he was in Earneſt willing to give it up, or had any body he was very deſirous ſhould ſucceed him; telling him, that, if he had, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oblig'd, in Return for his worthy Behaviour to him, to pay a particular Regard to his Recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. And ſo, being anſwer'd as he deſired, in they came together again.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhould ſay, that his withdrawing with a very ſerious Aſpect, made me afraid I had gone too far: And I ſaid, before they came in, What <hi>ſhall</hi> I do, if I have incurred Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Anger by my Over-forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!— Did he not look diſpleas'd? Dear my Ladies, if he be ſo, plead for me, and I will withdraw, when he comes in; for I cannot ſtand his Anger: I have not been uſed to it.</p>
                  <p>Never fear, you charming <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid my Lady, he can't be angry at any thing you ſay or do. But I wiſh, for the ſake of what I have been Witneſs to of Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s Behaviour and Modeſty, that ſuch a thing could be done for him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> bow'd, and ſaid, Oh my good Ladies! 'tis too, too conſiderable a thing:—I cannot expect it—I do not—It would be Preſumption if I did.</p>
                  <p>Juſt then re-enter'd Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> the firſt with a ſtately Air, the other with a more Peace-portending Smile on his Countenance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0272600703:304"/>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſitting down, Well, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid he, very gravely, I ſee, that Power is a dangerous thing in any Hand. — Sir, Sir! ſaid I. — My dear Lady, whiſpering to Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> I will withdraw, as I ſaid I would! — And I was getting away as faſt as I could: But he aroſe, and coming up to me, took my Hand, Why is my Charmer ſo ſoon frighten'd? ſaid he, moſt kindly; and ſtill more kindly, with a noble Air, preſſed it to his Lips. — I muſt not carry my Jeſt too far upon a Mind ſo apprehenſive, as I otherwiſe might be inclined to do. And leading me to Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> he ſaid, taking Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>'s Hand with his Left, as he held mine in his Right, Your worthy Brother Clergyman, Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> gives me Leave to confirm the Deciſion of my dear Spouſe, and you are to thank her for the Living of <hi>F.</hi> upon the Condition ſhe propoſed; and may you give but as much Satisfaction there, as you have done in this Family, and as Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> has given to his Flock; and they will then, after a while, be pleas'd as much with your Miniſtry, as they have hitherto been with his.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> trembled with Joy, and begg'd Leave to withdraw. — I cannot, — I cannot, ſaid he, — bear — bear — this Exceſs of Goodneſs. And he retir'd, with an Air of Gratitude and Tranſport in his Countenance, which Words cannot equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.</p>
                  <p>This affected me a good deal, as it did all the Company; but I was ſtill more affected, when Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid, Here, my Dear, thank good Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> for inabling you to give ſuch a ſhining Proof of your Excellence: And remember, that whenever I put any Power into your Hands for the future, you keep this happy Inſtance in Mind, and in every thing that offers, I ſhall then have no Will nor Choice but yours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:0272600703:305"/>Could I avoid, my dear Miſs, being thus nobly, more than generouſly — what ſhall I do for a Word to expreſs my Senſe of his Graciouſneſs to me? — Could I avoid, I ſay, doing a weak thing, without regarding the Preſence I was in? I fell on my Knees to him, and kiſſed his dear Hand, How ſhall I — how ſhall I, ſaid I, — oppreſſed with your hourly Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, — find Words? — But, Oh forgive me! Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings croud ſo thick upon me, that my Words, pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my Boſom with my other Hand, ſtick here, juſt here—and I cannot—</p>
                  <p>And indeed I could ſay no more; and he, in the Delicacy of his Apprehenſiveneſs for me, claſped his kind Arms about me, and withdrew with me into the next Parlour, and placed himſelf by me on the Settee, putting my Face on his generous Breaſt, and ſaid, Take care, take care, my best Beloved! that the Joy which overflows your dear Heart, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done a beneficent and a noble Action, to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Gentleman, does not affect you too much. You have no BODY juſt now, my dear Life! added he; your SPIRIT has abſorb'd it all: But you <hi>muſt</hi> deſcend, or what will become of me? And take care you don't do it too precipitately, for a Circumſtance ſo delicate, and ſo delightful to me!</p>
                  <p>My Lady <hi>Davers</hi> followed us, Where is my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel Siſter? where is my noble Brother? ſaid ſhe: Reſt her dear Head on my Boſom; for I have a Share in her next to yourſelf; and return to a Company where you'll not find a dry Eye, nor an opening Lip, but looking upon one another in ſpeechleſs Rapture at the exalted Scene you have exhibited between you.</p>
                  <p>My dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> delighted with every Occaſion that makes for my Honour, and to endear me to his beloved Siſter, ſaid, Take care then of my Jewel, and let her dear Face adorn the Boſom of a Lady I
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0272600703:306"/>
love next to herſelf. And riſing, went into the great Parlour.</p>
                  <p>I would have ſtood up; but, quite abaſhed at my recollected Behaviour before ſo many Witneſſes, and confounded with the Goodneſs of ſuch a Brother and ſuch a Siſter, my Feet were unwilling to ſupport me. And my dear Lady <hi>Davers</hi> (O Miſs, what a happy <hi>Pamela</hi> is your Friend! what a happy Daughter, my dear Father and Mother!) — claſped me in her Arms, and to her Boſom, and kiſſed me five or ſix times, running over with Expreſſions of Favour and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in a Style and Words I cannot repeat: For ſhe is Miſtreſs of a flowery Rhetorick, and has ſuch a charming Gift of Utterance, that could I but half equal her, when ſhe thus loftily ſoars, I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Compliments ſhe made me.</p>
                  <p>Coffee being ready, Lady <hi>Davers</hi> led me to the great withdrawing Room, and we were join'd by all the Company, and Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> too; and my Lord <hi>Davers</hi> was pleaſed to make me ſeveral fine Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo did Mr. <hi>H.</hi> after his Manner. But the Counteſs exceeded <hi>herſelf</hi> in Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſeemed ſo pleaſed, and ſo elated with the deſerved Acceptation his worthy Conduct had met with, that it ſhew'd he was far from repenting at the generous Turn the Matter had taken in favour of Mr. <hi>Adams:</hi> On the contrary, he congratulated him upon it, telling him, he would introduce him, when his generous Patron thought proper, to his new Pariſhioners, and would read Prayers for him at his firſt Preaching. And I think, Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> ſaid he, ſince this happy Affair has been brought about from the Converſation upon Diſpenſations, you and I, both by our Examples and our Arguments, muſt, on all Occaſions, diſcredit that Practice; ſince, as my Lady has obſerved, God's Providence is a better Reliance than the richeſt Benefice in <hi>England</hi>; and
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0272600703:307"/>
ſince, as her Ladyſhip has alſo obſerved, we ought not to look beyond a happy Competency, as if in <hi>this Life only we had Hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lady, ſaid Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> has given me many Leſſons, relating to different Parts of my Duty, both as a Chriſtian and a Clergyman, that will not only furniſh me with Rules for my future Conduct, but with Subjects for the beſt Sermons I ſhall ever be able to compoſe.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was pleaſed to ſay, It is a Rule with me, not to leave till To-morrow what can be done To-day: And when, my Dear, do you propoſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s good Offices in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily? Or did you intend to induce him to go to Town with us?</p>
                  <p>I had not propoſed any thing, Sir, as to that; for I had not asked your kind Direction: But the good Dean will ſupply us, I doubt not; and when we ſet out for <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> will be at full Liberty, with his worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> to purſue the happy Scheme, which your Goodneſs has permited to take Effect.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> my Dear, who came laſt from the Univerſity, can perhaps recommend ſuch another young Gentleman as himſelf, for your Domeſtick Duties.</p>
                  <p>I looked, it ſeems, a little grave, and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid, What have you to offer, <hi>Pamela?</hi> What have I ſaid amiſs?</p>
                  <p>Amiſs! dear Sir!—</p>
                  <p>Ay, and dear Madam, too! I ſee by your baſhful Seriouſneſs, in place of that ſmiling Approbation which you always ſhew when I utter any thing you <hi>intirely</hi> approve, that I have ſaid ſomething which would rather meet with your Acquieſcence, than Choice. So, as I have often told you, none of your Reſerves! And never <hi>heſitate</hi> to me your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0272600703:308"/>
in any thing, while you are ſure, I will conform to your Wiſhes, or purſue my own Liking, as <hi>either</hi> ſhall appear reaſonable to me, when I have heard <hi>your</hi> Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Why then, dear Sir, what I had preſumed to think, but I ſubmit it to your better Judgment, was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Gentleman who is ſo kind as to direct our Family Duties, in ſome meaſure acts in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the worthy Dean, it were not right, that our own Pariſh Miniſter, whether here or at <hi>London,</hi> ſhould name, or at leaſt approve <hi>our</hi> naming, the Gentleman?</p>
                  <p>Why could not I have thought of that, as well as you, Sauce-box? Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> I'm intirely on your Side. I think ſhe deſerves a Slap now for us both.</p>
                  <p>I'll forgive her, ſaid my Lady, ſince I find her Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and Actions as much a Reproach to others as to me.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> did you ever think, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> it would have come to this? Did you ever know ſuch a ſaucy Girl in your Life? — Already to give herſelf theſe reproaching Airs?</p>
                  <p>No, never, if your Honour is pleaſed to call the moſt excellent Lady in the World by ſuch a Name, nor any body elſe!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pamela,</hi> I charge you, ſaid the dear Gentleman, if you <hi>ſtudy</hi> for it, be ſometimes in the Wrong, that one may not always be taking Leſſons from ſuch an Aſſurance; but, in our Turns, have ſomething to teach <hi>you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, dear Sir, ſaid I, muſt I not be a ſtrange Creature? For how, when you, and my good Ladies, are continually giving me ſuch charming Examples, can I do a wrong thing?</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaid, Let him <hi>be hang'd,</hi> if he would not marry, as ſoon as ever he could get any body to have him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0272600703:309"/>Fooliſh Fellow! ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> do'ſt think that thou'lt meet with ſuch a Wife as that, when thou marryeſt?</p>
                  <p>Why not, Madam?—For if I am not ſo good as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> now is, I have not been ſo bad neither as he was formerly; Excuſe me, Sir: And ſo I may ſtand a Chance.</p>
                  <p>A Chance! ſaid my Lady—that's like thee.— Didſt ever hear of ſuch an one as ſhe?</p>
                  <p>I never, ſaid he, and fell a Laughing, <hi>ſaw</hi> ſuch an one, I own. And take <hi>that,</hi> my good Lady, for calling me <hi>Fooliſh Fellow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There's not the Reproach in thy Anſwer that thou intendeſt, except to thy own grinning Inſolence, ſaid her Ladyſhip, (ſevere enough, but ſmiling) that makes thee think <hi>that</hi> a Reflection, that is none in this Caſe.</p>
                  <p>Egad, Madam, you're always hard upon me! I can ſay nothing to pleaſe you. While every body elſe gives and receives Compliments, I can come in for nothing but <hi>Fooliſh Fellow</hi> with your Ladyſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nephew, ſaid my Lord, laughing, I think you come in for a large Part, and a facetious one too: For when you're preſent, and Converſation takes a ſerious Turn, you make an excellent Character to ſet us all a laughing.</p>
                  <p>He got up, and bow'd very low: I thank your Lordſhip. — You might as well have called me a Jack-pudden in plain Words; — but then I would have looked upon you all as ſo many Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks! — There I have you! ſaid he, and fell a laughing.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs, ſhuddering, ſaid, Dear, dear Mr. <hi>H.</hi> be ſilent, I beſeech you, whenever we are ſerious. For you tear one from the Feaſt of Souls to the Froth of Bodies.—Was not that a fine Rebuke, Miſs? Is not this a charming Lady?</p>

                  <p>Lady <hi>Davers</hi> told me afterwards, that Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> carried it mighty ſtiff and formal, when he alighted. He ſtrutted about the Court-yard in his Boots, with his Whip in his Hand; and tho' her Ladyſhip went to the great Door, in order to welcome him, he turn'd ſhort, and, whiſtling, followed the Groom into the Stable, as if he had been at an Inn, only, inſtead of taking off his Hat, pulling its broad Brim over his Eyes, for a Compliment. In ſhe went in a Pet, as ſhe ſays, ſaying to the Counteſs, A ſurly Brute he always was! <hi>My</hi> Uncle! He's more of an Hoſtler than a Gentleman: I'm reſolv'd I'll not ſtir to meet him again. And yet the Wretch loves Reſpect from others, tho' he never practiſes common Civility him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs ſaid, She was glad he was come; for ſhe lov'd to divert herſelf with ſuch odd Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters now-and-then.</p>
                  <p>And now let me give you a ſhort Deſcription of him as I found him, when I came in, that you may the better conceive what ſort of a Gentleman he is.</p>
                  <p>He is about Sixty-five Years of Age, a coarſe, ſtrong, big-bon'd Gentleman, with large irregular Features; he has a haughty ſupercilious Look, a ſwaggering Gait, and a Perſon not at all beſpeaking one's Favour in behalf of his Mind; and his Mind, as you ſhall hear by-and-by, not clearing up thoſe Prepoſſeſſions in his Diſfavour, with which his Perſon and Features at firſt impreſs one. His Voice is big and ſurly; his Eyes little and fiery; his Mouth large,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0272600703:312"/>
with what Teeth he has left, ground down, as it ſeem'd, even with his many-colour'd Gums, as if by conſtant Uſe. But with all theſe Imperfections, he has an Air that ſets him ſomewhat above the mere Vulgar, and ſuch as makes one think, that half his Diſadvantages are rather owing to his own haughty Humour, than to Nature: For he ſeems to be a perfect Tyrant at firſt Sight, a Man uſed to preſcribe, and not to be preſcribed to; and has the Advantage of a ſhrewd penetrating Look, which yet, methinks, ſeems rather acquired than natural.</p>
                  <p>After he had ſeen his Horſes well ſerv'd, and put on an old-faſhion'd Gold-button'd Coat, which by its Freſhneſs ſhew'd he had been very chary of it, a better Wig, but in ſtiff Buckle, and a long Sword, ſtuck ſtiffly, as if thro' his Coat Lappets; in he came, and with an imperious Air entering the Parlour, What, nobody come to meet me! ſaid he; and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting her Ladyſhip, How do you do, Niece? and look'd about haughtily, ſhe ſays, as if he expected to ſee me.</p>
                  <p>My Lady, preſenting the Counteſs, ſaid, The Counteſs of <hi>C.</hi> Sir <hi>Jacob!</hi>—O, cry Mercy! ſaid he —Your moſt obedient humble Servant, Madam; I hope his Lordſhip is well.</p>
                  <p>At your Service, Sir <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I wiſh he was, ſaid he, bluntly; he ſhould not have voted as he did laſt Seſſions, I can tell you that.</p>
                  <p>Why, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>Servants</hi> don't always, in this free Kingdom, do as their <hi>Maſters</hi> would have 'em.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mine</hi> do, I can tell you that, Madam.</p>
                  <p>Right or Wrong, Sir <hi>Jacob?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It can't be wrong, if I command them.</p>
                  <p>Why, truly, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> there's many a private Gentleman carries it higher to a Servant, than he
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0272600703:313"/>
cares his <hi>Prince</hi> ſhould to him: But I thought, till now, 'twas the King only could do no wrong.</p>
                  <p>But, Madam, I always take care to be right.</p>
                  <p>A good Reaſon—becauſe, I dare ſay, you never think you <hi>can</hi> be in the wrong.</p>
                  <p>Your Ladyſhip ſhould ſpare me: I'm but juſt come off a Journey. Let me turn myſelf about, and I'll be up with you, never fear, Madam. But where's my Nephew, Lady <hi>Davers?</hi> And where's your Lord? I was told you were all here, and young <hi>H.</hi> too, upon a very extraordinary Occaſion; ſo I was willing to ſee how Cauſes went among you, and what you were about. It will be long enough before you come to ſee me.</p>
                  <p>My Brother, and Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> are all rid out together.</p>
                  <p>Well, Niece, ſtrutting, with his Hands behind him, and his Head held up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Ha!—He has made a fine Kettle on't,—han't he!—'Sblood, (that was his profligate Word) that ever ſuch a Rake ſhould be ſo caught!—They tell me, ſhe's plaguy cunning, and quite ſmart and handſome.—But I wiſh his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were but living.—Yet what could he have done? He was always unmanageable: But I wiſh he'd been my Son; — by my Faith I do! —What! I hope, Niece, he locks up his Baby, while you're here! You don't keep her Company, do you?</p>
                  <p>Yes, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> reply'd my Lady, I do; and you'll not ſcruple to do ſo too, when you ſee her.</p>
                  <p>Why, thou countenanceſt him in his Folly, Child; I'd a better Opinion of thy Spirit! Thou married to a Lord, and thy Brother to a—Canſt tell me what, <hi>Barbara?</hi> If thou canſt, pr'ythee do.</p>
                  <p>To an Angel; and ſo you'll ſay, when you ſee her.</p>
                  <p>What, doſt think I ſhall look thro' <hi>his</hi> fooliſh Eyes?—What a Diſgrace to a Family ancienter than the Conqueſt!—O <hi>Tempora!</hi> O <hi>Mores!</hi> What will this World come to!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:0272600703:314"/>The Counteſs was diverted with this odd Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but run on in my Praiſe, for fear he ſhould ſay ſome rude things to me when I came in, and Lady <hi>Davers</hi> ſeconded her. But all, it ſeems, ſignify'd nothing. He would tell us both his Mind, let the young Whelp, that was his Word, take it as he would. And pray, ſaid he, can't I ſee this fine Body before he comes in? Let me but turn her round two of three times, and ask her a Queſtion or two; and by her Anſwers I ſhall know what to think of her in a Twinkling.</p>
                  <p>She is gone to take a little Airing, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> and won't be back till Supper-time.</p>
                  <p>Supper-time! Why, ſhe is not to ſit down at Table, is ſhe? If ſhe does, I won't; that's poſitive. —But now you talk of Supper, what have you?— I muſt have a boil'd Chicken, and ſhall eat it all my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. — Who's Houſe-keeper now? I ſuppoſe all's turn'd upſide down.</p>
                  <p>No, there is not one new Servant, except a Girl that waits upon her own Perſon: All the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are continued.</p>
                  <p>That's much! theſe Creatures generally take as great State upon 'em as a born Lady: And they're in the right. If they can make the Man ſtoop to the great Point, they'll hold his Noſe to the Grindſtone, never fear; and all the little ones come about in courſe.</p>
                  <p>Well, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> when you ſee her, you'll alter your Mind.</p>
                  <p>Never, never; that's poſitive.</p>
                  <p>Ay, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> I was as poſitive as you once; but I love her now as well as if ſhe was my own Siſter.</p>
                  <p>O hideous, hideous!—Tell it not in <hi>Gath</hi>; for thou'lt make the Daughters of <hi>Philiſtia</hi> triumph! All the Fools that he has made where-ever he has travelled, will clap their Hands at him, and at you too, if you
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0272600703:315"/>
talk at this Rate.—But let me ſpeak to Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> if ſhe be here: I'll order my own Supper.</p>
                  <p>So he went out, ſaying, He knew the Houſe, tho' in a better Miſtreſs's Days.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs ſaid, If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> kept his Temper, as ſhe hoped he would, there would be good Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with the old Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>O yes, ſaid my Lady, my Brother will, I dare ſay. He deſpiſes this ſurly Brute too much to be angry at him, let him ſay what he will.</p>
                  <p>He went, and talked a great deal againſt me, to Mrs. <hi>Jervis.</hi> You may gueſs, Miſs, that ſhe launched out in my Praiſes; and he was offended at her, and ſaid, Woman! Woman! forbear theſe ill-tim'd Praiſes: Her Birth's a Diſgrace to our Family. What! my Siſter's Waiting-maid, taken upon Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity! I cannot bear it.</p>
                  <p>I mention all theſe things, as the Ladies afterwards told them to me, becauſe it ſhall prepare you to judge what a fine Time I was likely to have of it.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and my Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> came home, which they did about half an Hour after Six, they were told who was there, juſt as they entered the Parlour; and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſmiled at Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> and entering,—Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaid he, Welcome to <hi>Bedford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire!</hi> And thrice Welcome to this Houſe! I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice to ſee you.</p>
                  <p>My Lady ſays, Never was ſo odd a Figure, as the old Baronet made, when thus accoſted. He ſtood up indeed; but as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> offer'd to take his Hand, he put 'em both behind him—Not that you know of, Sir!—And then looking up at his Face, and down at his Feet, three or four times ſucceſſively — Are you my Brother's Son? That very individual Son, that your good Father uſed to boaſt of, and ſay, that for handſome Perſon, true Courage, noble Mind,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0272600703:316"/>
was not to be matched in any three Counties in <hi>England?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The very ſame, dear Sir, that my honoured Father's Partiality uſed to think he never praiſed enough.</p>
                  <p>And what is all of it come to at laſt!— He paid well, did he not, to teach you to Know the World!—Ad's Life, Nephew! hadſt thou been a born Fool, or a raw Greenhead, or a doating Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head—</p>
                  <p>What then, Sir <hi>Jacob?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What then?—Why, then, thou wouldſt have done juſt as thou haſt done!</p>
                  <p>Come, come, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> you know not my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements. You know not what an Angel I have in Perſon and Mind. Your Eyes ſhall by-and-by be bleſt with the Sight of her: Your Ears with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſpeak:—And then you'll call all you have ſaid, Profanation.</p>
                  <p>What is it I hear! What is it I hear!—You talk in the Language of Romance; and from the Houſe-keeper to the Head of the Houſe, you're all ſtark-staring mad. By my Soul, Nephew, I wiſh, for thy own Credit, thou wert.—But what ſignifies Wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!—I hope you'll not bring your Syren into my Company.</p>
                  <p>Yes, I will, Sir, becauſe I love to give you Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And ſay not a Word more, for your own ſake, till you ſee her—You'll have the leſs to unſay, Sir <hi>Jacob</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the leſs to repent of.</p>
                  <p>The Devil!—I'm in an inchanted Caſtle, that's certain. What a Plague has this little Witch done to you all!—And how did ſhe bring it about?</p>
                  <p>The Ladies and Lord <hi>Davers</hi> laugh'd, it ſeems, and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> begging him to ſit down, and anſwer him ſome Family Queſtions, he ſaid, (for it ſeems he is very captious at times) What, a Devil! am I to be
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0272600703:317"/>
laugh'd at! Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> I hope <hi>you're</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd too, are you?</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> I am. My Siſter <hi>B.</hi> is my Doating-piece.</p>
                  <p>Whew! whiſtled he, with a wild Stare: And how is it with <hi>you,</hi> Youngſter?</p>
                  <p>With me, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I'd give all I'm worth in the World, and ever ſhall be worth, for ſuch another Wife.</p>
                  <p>He ran to the Window, and throwing up the Saſh, looking into the Court-yard, ſaid, Hollo— So-ho— Groom — <hi>Jack—Jonas</hi>— Get me my Horſe!— I'll keep no ſuch Company!—I'll be gone! Why, <hi>Jonas!</hi> calling again.</p>
                  <p>You're not in Earneſt, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am, by my Soul!—I'll away to the Village this Night! Why, you're all upon the High-Game!— I'll—But who comes here?— For juſt at that Inſtant, the Chariot brought me into the Court-yard — Who's this? Who is ſhe?</p>
                  <p>One of <hi>my</hi> Daughters, ſtarted up the Counteſs, my youngeſt Daughter <hi>Jenny!</hi>—She's the Pride of my Family, Sir <hi>Jacob!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By my Soul, ſaid he, I was running; for I thought it was the grand Inchantreſs.</p>
                  <p>Out ſtept Lady <hi>Davers</hi> to me: Dear <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid ſhe, humour all that's ſaid to you. Here's Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> come. You're the Counteſs of <hi>C</hi>—'s youngeſt Daughter <hi>Jenny</hi>—That's your Cue.</p>
                  <p>Ah! but Madam, ſaid I, Lady <hi>Jenny</hi> is not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd—looking (before I thought) on a Circumſtance that I think too much of ſometimes, tho' I carry it off as well as I can.</p>
                  <p>She laugh'd at my Exception: Come, Lady <hi>Jenny,</hi> ſaid ſhe, (for I juſt then enter'd the great Door) I hope you've had a fine Airing?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:0272600703:318"/>A very pretty one, Madam, ſaid I, as I enter'd the Parlour. This is a pleaſant Country, Lady <hi>Davers.— (Wink when I'm wrong, whiſper'd I—)</hi> Where's Mrs. <hi>B.?</hi>—Then, as ſeeing a ſtrange Gentleman, I ſtarted half back, into a more reſerv'd Air; and made him a low Court'ſy.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> look'd as if he did not know what to think of it, now at me, now at Mr. <hi>B.</hi>— But the dear Gentleman put him quite out of Doubt, by taking my Hand: Well, Lady <hi>Jenny,</hi> did you meet my Fugitive in your Tour?</p>
                  <p>No, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid I. Did ſhe go my Way? I told you I would keep the great Road.</p>
                  <p>Lady <hi>Jenny C</hi>—, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> preſenting me to his Uncle. A charming Creature! added the dear Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman: Have you never a Son worthy of ſuch an Alliance?</p>
                  <p>Ay, marry, Nephew, this is a Lady indeed! Why, the Plague, whiſper'd he, could you not have pitch'd your Tent here?—Miſs, by your Leave: And ſaluting me, turn'd to the Counteſs: By my Soul, Madam, you've a charming Daughter! Had my raſh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew ſeen this lovely Creature, and you'd have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended, he'd never have ſtoop'd to the Cottage, as he has done.</p>
                  <p>You're right, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> return'd Mr. <hi>B.</hi>; but I always ran too faſt for my Fortune: Yet, theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Family never bring out their Jewels into Batchelors Company; and when, too late, we ſee what we've miſs'd, we are vex'd at our Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Well ſaid, however, Boy. By my Soul, I wiſh thee Repentance, tho' 'tis out of thy Power to amend. Be that one of thy Curſes, when thou ſeeſt this Lady; as I make no doubt it is.</p>
                  <p>Again taking my Hand, and ſurveying me from Head to Foot, and turning me round, which, it
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0272600703:319"/>
ſeems, is a mighty Practice with him to a Stranger-Lady, (and a modeſt one too, you'll ſay, Miſs)— Why, truly, you're a charming Creature, Miſs— Lady <hi>Jenny,</hi> I would ſay—By your Leave, once more!—Upon my Soul, my Lady Counteſs, ſhe is a Charmer—But—But—ſtaring at me, Are you marry'd, Madam?</p>
                  <p>I look'd a little ſilly; and my new Mamma came up to me, and took my Hand: Why, <hi>Jenny,</hi> you are dreſs'd oddly to Day!—What a Hoop you wear! It makes you look I can't tell how!</p>
                  <p>Upon my Soul, Madam, I thought ſo; what ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Lying?—But 'tis only the Hoop, I ſee.— Really and truly, Lady <hi>Jenny,</hi> your Hoop is enough to make half an hundred of our Sex deſpair, for fear you ſhould be marry'd. I thought it was ſomething! Few Ladies eſcape my Notice. I always kept a good Look-out; for I have two Daughters of my own: But 'tis the Hoop, I ſee plainly enough. You are ſo ſlender every where but <hi>here</hi>; putting his Hand upon my Hip, which quite daſh'd me; and I retir'd behind my Lady Counteſs's Chair.</p>
                  <p>Fie, Sir <hi>Jacob!</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>B.;</hi> before us young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, to take ſuch Liberties with a Maiden Lady! —You give a bad Example.</p>
                  <p>Hang him that ſets you a bad Example, Nephew. But I ſee you're right; I ſee Lady <hi>Jenny</hi>'s a Maiden Lady, or ſhe would not have been ſo ſhamefac'd. I'll ſwear for her, on Occaſion. Ha, ha, ha—I'm ſure, repeated he, ſhe's a Maiden—For our Sex give the married Ladies a freer Air in a Trice.</p>
                  <p>How, Sir <hi>Jacob!</hi> ſaid Lady <hi>Davers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O fie, ſaid the Counteſs!—Can't you praiſe the Maiden Ladies, but at the Expence of the marry'd ones? What do you ſee of Freedom in me?</p>
                  <p>Or in me? ſaid Lady <hi>Davers.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0272600703:320"/>Nay, for that Matter, you are very well, Ladies, I muſt needs ſay.—But will you pretend to bluſh with that Virgin Roſe?—Will ye? Od's my Life, Miſs,—Lady <hi>Jenny,</hi> I would ſay, taking my Hand, come from behind your Mamma's Chair, and you two Ladies ſtand up now together.—There, ſo you do—Why now, Bluſh for Bluſh, and Lady <hi>Jenny</hi> ſhall be three to one, and a deeper Crimſon by half. Look you there, look you there elſe! An hundred Guineas to one againſt the Field.—Then ſtamping with one Foot, and lifting up his Hands and Eyes— O Chriſt! Lady <hi>Jenny</hi> has it all to nothing—By my Soul, ſhe has—Ha, ha, ha—You may well ſit down both of you; but you're a Bluſh too late, I can tell ye that.—Well haſt thou done, Lady <hi>Jenny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was haſtening away, and he ſaid, But let's ſee you again, Miſs; for now I will ſtay, if they bring nobody elſe.—And away I went, for I never was more out of Countenance. — What a ſtrange Creature, thought I, is this?</p>
                  <p>Supper being near ready, he continued calling out for Lady <hi>Jenny</hi>; for, he ſaid, the Sight of her did him good. But he was reſolv'd he would not ſit down at Table with <hi>ſomebody elſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Counteſs ſaid, She would fetch her Daughter; and ſtepping out, return'd, ſaying, Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, that Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> is here, and that he does not chuſe to ſee her; ſo ſhe begs to be excus'd; and my <hi>Jenny</hi> and ſhe deſire to ſup together.</p>
                  <p>The very worſt Tidings I have heard this Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month. Why, Nephew, let your Girl ſup with any body, ſo we may have Lady <hi>Jenny</hi> back with us.—</p>
                  <p>I know, ſaid the Counteſs, (who was deſirous to ſee how far he would carry it) <hi>Jenny</hi> won't leave Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> ſo if you ſee <hi>one,</hi> you muſt ſee <hi>t'other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, then, if it muſt be ſo, I muſt ſit down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.—But yet, I ſhould be glad to ſee Lady <hi>Jenny,</hi>

that I ſhould. But I will not ſit down at Table with Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Girl—that's poſitive.</p>
                  <p>Well, well, let 'em ſup together, and there's an End of it, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi>—I ſee my Uncle has as good a Judgment as any body of fine Ladies (<hi>That I have, Nephew</hi>):—But he can't forego his Humour, in Compliment to the fineſt Lady in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conſider, Nephew, conſider—'Tis not thy doing a fooliſh Thing, and calling a Girl Wife, ſhall cram a Niece down my Throat, that's poſitive. The Moment thy Girl comes down to take place of theſe Ladies, I am gone, that's moſt certain.</p>
                  <p>Well then, ſhall I go up, and oblige <hi>Pamela</hi> to ſup by herſelf, and perſuade Lady <hi>Jenny</hi> to come down to us?</p>
                  <p>With all my Soul, Nephew—A good Motion.— But, <hi>Pamela</hi>—did you ſay?—A queer ſort of Name! I've heard of it ſomewhere! —Is it a Chriſtian or a Pagan Name?—Linſey-wolſey—half one, half t'other— like thy Girl—Ha, ha, ha.</p>
                  <p>Let me be <hi>hang'd,</hi> whiſper'd Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to his Aunt, if Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> has not a Power of Wit; tho' he's ſo whimſical with it. I like him much.</p>
                  <p>But hark ye, Nephew, ſaid Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was going out of the Parlour—one Word with you. Don't fob upon us your Girl with the Pagan Name for Lady <hi>Jenny.</hi> I have ſet a Mark upon her, and ſhould know her from a Thouſand, altho' ſhe had chang'd her Hoop.—Then he laugh'd again, and ſaid, He hoped Lady <hi>Jenny</hi> would come—And come without any body with her—But I ſmell a Plot, ſaid he—By my Soul I won't ſtay, if they both come together. I won't be put upon — But here comes one or both—Where's my Whip?—I'll go.</p>
                  <p>Indeed Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I had rather have ſtaid with Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>—ſaid I, as I enter'd—as he had bid me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:0272600703:322"/>'Tis ſhe, 'tis ſhe—You've no body behind you?— No, ſhe han't.—Why now, Nephew, you're right. I was afraid you'd have put a Trick upon me.— You'd <hi>rather,</hi> repeated he, have ſtay'd with Mrs. <hi>B.!</hi>—Yes, I warrant.—But you ſhall be plac'd in better Company, my dear Child.</p>
                  <p>Siſter, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will you be pleaſed to take that Chair; for <hi>Pamela</hi> does not chuſe to give my Uncle Diſguſt, who ſo ſeldom comes to ſee us.</p>
                  <p>My Lady took the upper End of the Table, and I ſat next below my new Mamma: So, <hi>Jenny,</hi> ſaid ſhe, How have you left Mrs. <hi>B.?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A little concern'd, ſaid I—But ſhe was the eaſier, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himſelf deſir'd I'd come down.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Davers</hi> ſat next me, and Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, Shall I beg a Favour of you, my Lord; to let me ſit next to Lady <hi>Jenny?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid, Won't it be better to ſit over-againſt her, Uncle?</p>
                  <p>Ay, that's right. I'faith, Nephew, thou know'ſt what's right. Well, ſo I will.—He accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his Seat, and I was very glad of it; for tho' I was ſure to be ſtar'd at ſufficiently by him, yet I was afraid, if he ſat next me, he would not keep his Hands off my Hoop.</p>
                  <p>He run on a deal in my Praiſes, after his manner, but ſo rough at times, that he gave me Pain.</p>
                  <p>After Supper, the Gentlemen ſat down to their Bottle, and the Ladies and I withdrew, and about Twelve they broke up, Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> talking of nothing but Lady <hi>Jenny,</hi> and wiſhing Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had marry'd ſo happily as with ſuch a charming Creature; One, he ſaid, that carried Tokens of her high Birth in her Face, and whoſe every Feature, and Look, ſhew'd her nobly deſcended.</p>
                  <p>They let him go to Bed with his Miſtake: But the Counteſs ſaid next Morning, She thought ſhe never
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0272600703:323"/>
ſaw a greater Inſtance of ſtupid Pride, and Churliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhe ſhould be ſick of the Advantage of Birth or Anceſtry, if this was the natural Fruit of it. For a Man, ſaid her Ladyſhip, to come to his Nephew's Houſe, and to ſuffer the Miſtreſs of it (as he thinks) to be cloſetted up, and not permitted to appear, in order to humour his abſurd and brutal Inſolence, and to behave as he has done; is ſuch a Ridicule upon the Pride of Deſcent, that I ſhall think of it as long as I live. O Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid ſhe, what Advantages have you over every one that ſees you; but moſt over thoſe who pretend to treat you unworthily!</p>
                  <p>I expect to be called to Breakfaſt every Minute, and ſhall then, perhaps, ſee how this Matter will end. I wiſh when it is revealed, he is not in a Fury, and think himſelf impoſed on. I fear it won't end ſo well as I wiſh; for every body ſeems to be grave and angry at Sir <hi>Jacob.</hi>

                  <head>THURSDAY.</head>
                  <p>I Now proceed with my Tale. At Breakfaſt-time, when every one was ſat, and a Chair left for me, Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> began to call out for Lady <hi>Jenny.</hi> But, ſaid he, I'll have none of your Girl, Nephew, altho' the Chair at the Tea-Table is left for ſomebody. No, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> we'll get Lady <hi>Jenny</hi> to ſupply Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>'s Place, as you don't care to ſee her.</p>
                  <p>With all my Heart, reply'd he.</p>
                  <p>But, Uncle, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Have you really no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, no Curioſity to ſee the Girl I have marry'd? No, none at all, by my Soul.</p>
                  <p>Juſt then I came in, and paying my Compliments to the Company, and to Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> Shall I, ſaid I,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0272600703:324"/>
ſupply Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>'s Place, in her Abſence? And down I ſat.</p>
                  <p>After Breakfaſt, and the Servants were withdrawn, Lady <hi>Jenny,</hi> ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> you are a young Lady who have all the Advantages of Birth and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, and ſome of the beſt Blood in the Kingdom runs in your Veins; and here Sir <hi>Jacob Swynford</hi> is your great Admirer: Cannot <hi>you,</hi> from whom it will come with a double Grace, convince him, that he does an unkind thing, at my Brother's Houſe, to keep the Perſon my Brother has thought worthy of making the Miſtreſs of it, out of Company? And let us know your Opinion, Whether my Brother himſelf does right, to comply with ſuch an unreaſonable Diſtaſte?</p>
                  <p>Why how now, Lady <hi>Davers!</hi> This from you! I did not expect it!</p>
                  <p>My Uncle, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is the only Perſon in the Kingdom that I would have humoured thus: And I made no doubt, when he ſaw how willing I was to oblige him in ſo high a Point, he would have acted a more generous Part than he has yet done. But, Lady <hi>Jenny,</hi> what ſay you to my Siſter's Queſtions?</p>
                  <p>If I muſt ſpeak my Mind, reply'd I, I ſhould take the Liberty to be very ſerious with Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to ſay, That when a thing is done, and cannot be help'd, he ſhould take care how he ſows the Seeds of Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and Animoſity between Man and Wife: And how he makes a Gentleman diſſatisfy'd with his Choice, and perhaps unhappy as long as he lives.</p>
                  <p>Nay, Miſs, ſaid he, if all are againſt me, and you, whoſe good Opinion I value more than all, you may e'en let the Girl come, and ſit down, if you will.— If ſhe is but half as pretty, and half as wiſe, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, as you, I ſhall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it cannot be help'd, as you ſay, be ready to think better of the Matter. For 'tis a little hard, I muſt needs ſay, if ſhe has hitherto
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0272600703:325"/>
appear'd before all the good Company, to have her kept out of the way on my Account.</p>
                  <p>Really, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaid the Counteſs, I have bluſh'd for you more than once on this Occaſion. But the Miſtreſs of this Houſe is more than half as wiſe, and modeſt, and lovely: And in hopes you will return me back ſome of the Bluſhes I have lent you, ſee <hi>there,</hi> in my Daughter <hi>Jenny,</hi> whom you have been ſo juſtly admiring, the Miſtreſs of the Houſe, and the Lady with the Pagan Name!</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> ſat aghaſt, looking at one, and at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and at me, each in Turn, and then caſt his Eyes on the Floor.—At laſt, up he got, and ſwore a ſad Oath, And am I thus trick'd and bamboozled, that was his Word; am I?—There's no bearing this Houſe, nor her Preſence now, that's certain; and I'll be gone.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> looking at me, and nodding his Head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> as he was in a Flutter to be gone, I aroſe from my Chair, and went to him, and took his Hand. I hope, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> you will be able to bear <hi>both,</hi> when you ſhall ſee that there is no other Difference but that of Deſcent, between the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Lady <hi>Jenny,</hi> whom you ſo kindly praiſed, and the Girl your dear Nephew has ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</p>
                  <p>Let me go, ſaid he, I'm moſt confoundedly bit.— I cannot look you in the Face!— By my Soul I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not!—For 'tis impoſſible you ſhould forgive me.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it is not, Sir; you have done nothing but what I can forgive you for, if your dear Nephew can; for to him was the Wrong, if any, and I'm ſure he can overlook it.—And for his ſake, to the Uncle of ſo honoured a Gentleman, to the Brother of my late good Lady, I can, with a bent Knee, <hi>thus,</hi> ask your Bleſſing, and deſire your Excuſe for joining to keep you in this Suſpenſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0272600703:326"/>Bleſs you!—O Chriſt! ſaid he, and ſtamp'd— Who can chuſe but bleſs you? And he kneeled down, and wrapp'd his Arms about me.—But, curſe me, that was his ſtrange Word, if ever I was ſo touched before!</p>
                  <p>My dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> for fear my Spirits ſhould be too much affected, (for the rough Baronet, in his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, had bent me down lower than I kneeled) came to me, and held me by my Arm; but let Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> raiſe me, only ſaying, How does my Angel? Now ſhe has made this Conqueſt, ſhe has completed all her Triumphs.</p>
                  <p>Angel did you call her!—By my Soul, I'm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with her Goodneſs, and her ſweet Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage!—Riſe, and let me ſee if I can ſtand, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!—And, believe me, I am ſorry I have acted ſo much like a Bear as I have done; and the more I think of it, the more I ſhall be aſham'd of myſelf.— And the Tears, as he ſpoke, ran down his rough Cheeks, which moved me a good deal; for to ſee a Man with ſo rough and ſo hard a Countenance weep, was a touching Sight.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> putting his Handkerchief to his Eyes, his Aunt ſaid, What's the Matter, <hi>Jackey?</hi>—The Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! anſwer'd he; I don't know how the D—l 'tis— But here's ſtrange Doings, as ever I knew—For here, Day after Day, one's ready to cry, without knowing whether it be for Joy or Sorrow!—What a Plague's the Matter with me, I wonder!—And out he went, the two Ladies, whoſe charming Eyes, too, gliſten'd with Pleaſure, ſmiling at the Effect the Scene had upon Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and at what he ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Well, Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> approaching me; for I had ſat down, but then ſtood up—You will forgive me; and from my Heart I wiſh you Joy. By my Soul I do—and ſaluted me—I could not have believed there had been ſuch a Perſon breathing.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0272600703:327"/>
I don't wonder at my Nephew's loving you!— And you call her Siſter, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> don't you?— If you do, I'll own her for my Niece.</p>
                  <p>Don't I!—Yes, I do, ſaid her Ladyſhip, coming to me, and am proud ſo to call her. And this I tell you, for <hi>your</hi> Comfort, tho' to <hi>my own</hi> Shame, that I uſed her worſe than you have done, before I knew her Excellence, and have repented of it ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>I bow'd to her Ladyſhip—and kiſſing her Hand— My deareſt Lady, ſaid I, you have made me rich Amends ſince. I am ſure I may ſay, <hi>That it was good for me that I was afflicted!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why, Nephew, ſhe has the Fear of God, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, before her Eyes too! I'm ſure I've heard thoſe Words. They are ſomewhere in the Scripture, I believe!—Why, who knows, but ſhe may be a means to ſave your Soul?—Hay, you know!</p>
                  <p>Ay, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſhe'll be a means to ſave an hundred Souls, and might go a great way to ſave yours, if you were to live with her but one Month.</p>
                  <p>Well, but, Nephew, I hope <hi>you</hi> forgive me, too; for, now I think of it, I never knew you take any Matter ſo patiently in my Life.</p>
                  <p>I knew, ſaid the dear Gentleman, that every Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance you inſiſted upon, was heightening my Charmer's Triumph, and increaſing your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition; and as I was not <hi>indeed</hi> depriv'd of her Company, I could bear with every thing you ſaid or did — Yet, don't you remember, that I caution'd you, that the leſs you ſaid againſt her, the leſs you'd have to unſay, and the leſs to repent of?</p>
                  <p>I do; and let me ride out, and call myſelf to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for all I ſaid againſt her, in her own Hearing; and when I can think of but one half, and how ſhe has taken it, by my Soul, I believe 'twill make me more than half mad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:0272600703:328"/>At Dinner (when we had Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany) the Baronet told me, he admir'd me now, as much as he did when he thought me Lady <hi>Jenny</hi>; but complain'd of the Trick put upon him by us all, and ſeem'd now-and-then a little ſerious upon it.</p>
                  <p>He took great Notice of the Dexterity which he imputed to me, in performing the Honours of the Table. And every now-and-then, he lifted up his Eyes, God take me! Very clever, by my Soul!— Why, Madam, you ſeem to me to be born to theſe Things!—I will be help'd by nobody but you—And you'll have a Task of it, I can tell you; for I have a whipping Stomach, and were there fifty Diſhes, I always taſte of every one. And indeed <hi>John</hi> was in a manner wholly imploy'd in going to and fro between the Baronet and me, for half an Hour together.</p>
                  <p>He went from us afterwards to Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> and made her anſwer him abundance of Queſtions about me, and how all theſe Matters had come about, as he phraſed it; and returning, when we drank Coffee, ſaid, I have been <hi>confabbing,</hi> that was his Word, with Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> about you, Niece. By my Soul, I never heard the like! She tells me, you can play on the Spinnet, and ſing too: Will you let a body have a Tune or ſo? My <hi>Mab</hi> can play pretty well, and ſo can <hi>Dolly</hi>:—I'm a Judge of Muſick, and would fain hear you. I ſaid, If he was a Judge, I ſhould be afraid to play before him; but I would not be ask'd twice, when we had taken our Coffee.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, he repeating his Requeſt, I gave him a Tune, and ſung to it; Od's my Life, ſaid he, you do it purely!—But I ſee where it is—My Girls have got <hi>my</hi> Fingers! And then he held both Hands out, and a fine Pair of Paws ſhew'd he!—Plague on't, they touch two Keys at once; but thoſe ſlender and nimble Fingers, how they ſweep along! My Eye can't follow 'em—Whew—whiſtled he—They are
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0272600703:329"/>
here and there, and every-where at once!— Why, Nephew, I believe you've put another Trick upon me. My Niece is certainly of Quality! And Report has not done her Juſtice.—One more Tune, one more Song—By my Faith, your Voice goes ſweetly to your Fingers. 'Slife—I'll threſh my Jades—that was his polite Phraſe, when I come home. — Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> you know not the Money they have coſt me to qualify them; and here is a mere Baby to them, outdoes 'em by a Bar's Length, without any Expence at all beſtow'd upon her. Go over that again—Confound me for a Puppy! I loſt it, by my Prating.—Ay, there you have it!—That's it, by my Soul, it is! Oh! that I could but dance as well as thou ſing'ſt! I'd give you a Saraband, as old as I am.</p>
                  <p>After Supper, we fell into a Converſation, of which I muſt give you ſome Account, becauſe it was upon a Topick that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has been blam'd for in his marrying me, and which has ſtuck by ſome of his Friends, even after they have, in Kindneſs to me, acquitted him in every other reſpect; and that is, The Example that he has ſet to young Gentlemen of Family and Fortune to marry beneath them.</p>
                  <p>It was begun by Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> who ſaid, I am in Love with my new Niece, that I am: But ſtill one thing ſticks with me in this Affair; and that is, What will become of Degree or Diſtinction, if this Practice of Gentlemen marrying their Mothers Waiting-maids, (Excuſe me, Madam) ſhould come into Vogue? Already, young Ladies and young Gentlemen are too apt to be drawn away in this manner, and to diſgrace their Family. We have too many Inſtances of this. You'll forgive me, both of you.</p>
                  <p>That, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> is the only Thing! — I muſt needs ſay, Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> has hit upon the Point, that would make one wiſh this Example had not been ſet by a Gentleman of ſuch an antient Family; till
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0272600703:330"/>
one comes to be acquainted with this dear Creature; and then every body thinks it ought not to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than it is.</p>
                  <p>Ay, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> what can you ſay to this? Cannot you defend me from this Charge? This is a Point that has been often objected to me: Try for one of your pretty Arguments in my Behalf.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Sir, reply'd I, looking down, it becomes not me to ſay any thing to this.</p>
                  <p>But indeed it does, if you can: And I beg you'll help me to ſome Excuſe, if you have any at Hand.</p>
                  <p>Won't you, Sir, diſpenſe with me, on this Occaſion? Indeed, I know not what to ſay. Indeed I ſhould not, if I may judge for myſelf, ſpeak one <hi>Word</hi> to this Subject.—For it is my abſolute Opinion, that Degrees in general ſhould be kept up; altho' I muſt always deem the preſent Caſe an happy Exception to the Rule.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> looking as if he ſtill expected I ſhould ſay ſomething, Won't you, Sir, diſpenſe with me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated I? Indeed I ſhould not ſpeak to this Point, if I may be my own Judge.</p>
                  <p>I always intend, my Dear, you ſhall judge for yourſelf; and you know, I ſeldom urge you farther, when you uſe thoſe Words. But if you have any thing upon your Mind to ſay, let's have it: For your Arguments are always new and unborrow'd.</p>
                  <p>I would then, if I <hi>muſt,</hi> Sir, ask, If there be not a Nation, or if there has not been a Law in ſome Nation, That whenever a young Gentleman, be <hi>his</hi> Degree what it would, has ſeduced a poor Creature, be <hi>her</hi> Degree what it would, obliges the Gentleman to marry that unhappy Perſon?</p>
                  <p>I think there is ſuch a Law in ſome Country, I can't tell where, ſaid Sir <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And do you think, Sir, whether it be ſo, or not that it is equitable it ſhould be ſo?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0272600703:331"/>Yes, by my Troth— Tho', I muſt needs own, if it were ſo in <hi>England,</hi> many Men, that I know, would not have had the Wives they now have.</p>
                  <p>You ſpeak to your Knowlege, I doubt not, Sir <hi>Jacob?</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why, indeed—Why, truly—I don't know but I do.</p>
                  <p>All then, ſaid I, that I would infer is, Whether another Law would not be a ſtill more juſt and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table one, that the Gentleman who is repuls'd, from a Principle of Virtue and Honour, ſhould not be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd for marrying a Perſon he could <hi>not</hi> ſeduce? And whether it is not more for both their Honours, if he does; inaſmuch as it is nobler to reward a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, than to repair a Shame, were that Shame to be repair'd by Matrimony; which I take the Liberty to doubt. But I beg Pardon; you commanded me, Sir—Elſe this Subject ſhould not have found a Speaker to it, in me.</p>
                  <p>This is admirably ſaid—By my Soul, it is, ſaid Sir <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet this comes not up to the Objection, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> The ſetting an Example to Waiting-maids to aſpire, and to young Gentlemen to deſcend. And I will enter into the Subject myſelf; and the rather, becauſe, as I go along, I will give Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> a faint Sketch of the Merit and Character of my <hi>Pamela,</hi> of which he cannot be ſo well inform'd, as he has been of the Diſgrace, which he imagin'd I had brought upon myſelf by marrying her.</p>
                  <p>In order to this, give me Leave to ſay, That I think it neceſſary, that as well thoſe Perſons who are afraid the Example ſhould be taken, as thoſe who are inclin'd to follow it, ſhould take <hi>all</hi> the material Parts of it into their Conſideration: Otherwiſe, I think the Precedent may be juſtly cleared; and the Fears of the one be judged groundleſs, and the Plea
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0272600703:332"/>
of the other but a Pretence, in order to cover a Folly, into which they would have fallen, whether they had this Example or not.</p>
                  <p>For Inſtance: In order to lay Claim to the Excuſes which my Conduct, if I may ſuppoſe it of Force enough to do either Good or Hurt, will furniſh, it is neceſſary,</p>
                  <p>That the Object of their Wiſh ſhould be a Girl of exquiſite Beauty, (and that not only in their own blinded and partial Judgments, but in the Opinion of <hi>every one</hi> who ſees her, Friend or Foe) in order to juſtify the Force that the <hi>firſt</hi> Attractions have upon him.</p>
                  <p>That ſhe be deſcended of honeſt and conſcientious, tho' poor and obſcure Parents; who having preſerved their Integrity, thro' great Trials and Afflictions, have, by their Examples, as well as Precepts, laid deep in the Girl's Mind the Foundations of Piety and Virtue.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary, that to the Charms of Perſon, this Waiting-maid ſhould have an humble, teachable Mind, fine natural Parts, a ſprightly, yet inoffeſive Wit, a Temper ſo excellent, and a Judgment ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, as ſhould promiſe for her, (by the Love and Eſteem theſe Qualities ſhould attract to herſelf from her Fellow-ſervants, ſuperior and inferior) that ſhe would become an higher Station, and be reſpected in it.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary, that after ſo good a Foundation laid by her Parents, ſhe ſhould have all the Advantages of Female Education conferred upon her: The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of an excellent Lady, improving and building upon ſo worthy a Foundation. A Capacity ſurpriſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ready to take in all that is taught her: An At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Aſſiduity and Diligence almoſt peculiar to herſelf, at her Time of Life; inſomuch as, at Fifteen or Sixteen Years of Age, to be able to vie with any
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0272600703:333"/>
young Lady of Rank, as well in the natural Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teelneſs of her Perſon, as in her Acquirements: And that in nothing but her <hi>Humility</hi> ſhe ſhould manifeſt any Difference between herſelf and the High-born.</p>
                  <p>It will be neceſſary, moreover, that ſhe ſhould have a Mind above Temptation; that ſhe ſhould reſiſt the <hi>Offers</hi> and <hi>Menaces</hi> of one upon whom all her worldly Happineſs ſeemed to depend; the Son of a Lady to whom ſhe owed the greateſt Obligations; a Perſon whom ſhe did not <hi>hate,</hi> but greatly <hi>feared,</hi> and whom her grateful Heart would have been <hi>glad</hi> to oblige; and who ſought to prevail over her Virtue, by all the Inducements that could be thought of, to <hi>attract</hi> a young unexperienced Virgin, at one time, or to <hi>frighten</hi> her, at another, into his Purpoſes; who offer'd her high, very high Terms, her Circumſtances conſider'd, as well for herſelf, as for Parents ſhe loved better than herſelf, whoſe Circumſtances at the ſame Time were low and diſtreſsful.</p>
                  <p>That ſhe ſhould ſhew, on requiſite Occaſions, that ſhe preferred her Virtue to her Life: That if ever ſhe ſhould be caſt wholly into the Power of one, who, ſhe had too much Reaſon to think, would ſtick at nothing to gain his Ends, ſhe ſhould bear Perſecution from his Agents, withſtand repeated Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from himſelf, tho' trying to influence her by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, when he could not move her other Paſſions, (Revenge, the darling Paſſion of the Sex, ſo ſeldom failing to anſwer a Tempter's Purpoſe, be he Man or Devil, that was his Expreſſion) in pretending to put her Perſecutor in her Power.— And when ſhe ſaw no viſible Way to eſcape, having been diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in an hundred pretty Machinations ſhe had form'd, young and unaſſiſted as ſhe was, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd, that if ſhe yielded not to the high and alluring Terms he offered, he would execute all his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and ſhe ſhould not have one Advantage that
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0272600703:334"/>
he then tender'd to her; — yet to be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in ſuch Words as theſe, which will always dwell upon my Memory:— <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Vol. I.</hi> p. <hi>252.</hi> &amp; ſeqq.</note> I reject your Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals with all my Soul."</q> — <q rend="inline margQuotes">"May God deſert me, whenever I make worldly Grandeur my chiefeſt Good!"</q>
—
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I know I am in your Power; I dread your Will to ruin me is as great as your Power.' —Yet, will I dare to tell you, I will make no Free-will Offering of my Virtue. All that I <hi>can</hi> do, poor as it is, I <hi>will</hi> do, to ſhew you, that my Will bore no Part in my Violation."</q>
—And when future Marriage was intimated to her, to induce her to yield, to be able to anſwer,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"The Moment I yield to your Propoſals, there is an End of all Merit, if now I have any. — And I ſhould be ſo far from <hi>expecting</hi> ſuch an Honour, that I will pronounce, I ſhould be moſt <hi>unworthy</hi> of it."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If, I ſay, my dear Friends, ſuch a Girl can be found, thus beautifully attractive in <hi>every one</hi>'s Eye, and not partially ſo only in a young Gentleman's <hi>own</hi>; and after that, (what good Perſons would infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely prefer to Beauty) thus piouſly principled, thus genteelly educated and accompliſhed, thus brilliantly witty, thus prudent, modeſt, generous, undeſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and having been thus tempted, thus try'd, by the Man ſhe hated not, purſued, (not intriguingly purſuing) be thus inflexibly virtuous, and Proof againſt Temptation; Let her reform her Libertine, and let him marry her: And were he of princely Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, I dare anſwer for it, that no <hi>two</hi> Princes in <hi>one</hi> Age, take the World through, would be in Danger. For, altho' I am ſenſible it is not to my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, I will ſay, that I never met with a Repulſe, nor a Conduct, like this; and yet I never ſunk very low, for the Subjects of my Attempts, either at Home or Abroad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0272600703:335"/>Theſe are obvious Inferences, added the dear Gentleman, and not Refinements upon my <hi>Pamela</hi>'s Story; and if the Gentleman were capable of Thought and Compariſon, would rather make ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, as is apprehended, <hi>more,</hi> than <hi>leſs,</hi> difficult than <hi>before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if indeed, added he, the young Fellow be ſuch a Booby, that he cannot <hi>reflect</hi> and <hi>compare,</hi> and take the Caſe with <hi>all its Circumſtances</hi> together, I think his good Papa or Mamma ſhould get him a Wife to their own Liking, as ſoon as poſſible; and the pooreſt Girl in <hi>England,</hi> who is honeſt, would rather have Reaſon to bleſs herſelf for eſcaping ſuch a Husband, than to glory in the Catch ſhe would have of him. For ſuch a young Fellow as that, would hardly do Honour to his Family in any <hi>one</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, ſaid the Counteſs, it would be pity, after all, that ſuch an one ſhould marry any Lady of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Birth; for, 'tis enough in Conſcience, that he is a Diſgrace to <hi>one</hi> worthy Family; it would be pity he ſhould make <hi>two</hi> unhappy.</p>
                  <p>Why, really, Nephew, ſaid Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> I think you have ſaid a great deal to the Purpoſe. There is not ſo much Danger from the Example, as I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, from <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>reflecting</hi> Minds. I did not conſider this Matter thoroughly, I muſt needs ſay.</p>
                  <p>All the Buſineſs is, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers</hi>—You'll excuſe me, Siſter—There will be more People will hear, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has marry'd his Mother's Waiting-maid, than will know his Inducements.</p>
                  <p>Not many, I believe, Siſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> — For when 'tis known, I have ſome Character in the World, and am not quite an Idiot, (And my Faults, in having not been one of the moſt virtuous of Men, will ſtand me in ſome Stead in <hi>this</hi> Caſe, tho' hardly in <hi>any
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0272600703:336"/>
other</hi>) they will naturally inquire into my Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>But ſee you not, when we go Abroad, to Church, or elſewhere, what Numbers of People her Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter draws to admire the dear Creature? Does not this ſhew, that her Virtue has made her more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, than my Fortune had made me? For I paſs'd up and down quietly enough before, (handſome as my Equipage always was) and attracted not any body's Notice: And indeed I had as lieve theſe Honours were not ſo publickly paid <hi>her;</hi> for even, were I <hi>fond</hi> of Shew and Parade, what are they, but a Reproach to me?—And can I have any Excellence, but a ſecondary one, in having, after all my Perſecutions of her, done but common Juſtice to her Merit?</p>
                  <p>This anſwers your Objection, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> and ſhews, that <hi>my</hi> Inducements and <hi>her</hi> Story muſt be equally known. And, upon my Conſcience, I think, (every thing I have ſaid conſidered, and every thing that might ſtill farther be urged, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that dear Creature in the Station ſhe adorns, ſo much exceeding all I hoped, or could flatter myſelf with, from the moſt promiſing Appearances) that ſhe does me more Honour than I have done her; and if I am capable of putting myſelf in a third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Place, I think I ſhould be of the ſame Opinion, were I to determine upon ſuch another Pair, exactly circumſtanc'd as we are.</p>
                  <p>You may believe, Miſs, how much this generous Defence of the Step he had taken, attributing every thing to me, and depreciating his worthy Self, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me. I play'd with a Cork now, with my Rings another time, turning them round my Fingers, looked down, and on one Side, and every Way I looked but on the Company; for they gazed too much upon me all the time; ſo that I could only glance a tearful Eye now-and-then upon the dear Gentleman;
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0272600703:337"/>
and when it would overflow, catch in my Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief the eſcaped Fugitives, that would ſtart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden beyond their proper Limits, tho' I often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, by a twinkling Motion, to diſperſe the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Water, before it had formed itſelf into Drops too big to be reſtrained.</p>
                  <p>All the Company praiſed the dear generous Speaker, and he was pleaſed to ſay farther, Altho', my good Friends, I can truly ſay, that with all the Pride of Family, and the Inſolence of Fortune, which once made me doubt whether I ſhould not ſink too low, if I made my <hi>Pamela</hi> my Miſtreſs, (for I ſhould then have treated her not ungenerouſly, and ſhould have ſuffered her perhaps to call herſelf by my Name) I have never once repented of what I have done: On the contrary, I have always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in it, and it has been, from the firſt Day of our Marriage, my Pride and my Boaſt, (and ſhall be, let others ſay what they will) that I can call ſuch an Excellence, and ſuch a Purity, which I ſo little deſerve, mine; and I look down with Contempt upon the Raſhneſs of all ſuch as reflect upon me; for they can have no Notion of my Happineſs, or her Merit.</p>
                  <p>O dear Sir! ſaid I, how do you over-rate my poor Merit!—Some Perſons are happy in a Life of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi> but mine's a Life of <hi>Joy!</hi>—One rapturous Inſtance follows another ſo faſt, that I know not how to bear them.</p>
                  <p>Whew!—whiſtled Sir <hi>Jacob.</hi>—Whereabouts am I?—I hope, by-and-by, you'll come down to our Pitch, that one may put in a Word or two with you.</p>
                  <p>May you be long thus bleſt, and thus happy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether! ſaid Lady <hi>Davers.</hi> I know not which to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire moſt, the dear Girl, that never was bad, or the dear Gentleman, that, having been bad, is now ſo good!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="333" facs="tcp:0272600703:338"/>Said my Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> There is hardly any bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe moving Scenes, ſo quick, as my Siſter ſays, following one another!</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs was pleaſed to ſay, That till now ſhe had been at a Loſs to form any Notion of the Happineſs of the firſt Pair before the Fall: But now, by ſo fine an Inſtance as this, ſhe comprehended it in all its Force.—God continue you to one another, added her Ladyſhip, for a Credit to the State, and to Human Nature.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> having his Elbows on the Table, folded his Hands, ſhaking them, and looking down upon the Table, Egad, this is uncommon Life, that it is! —Your two Souls, I can ſee that, are like well-tun'd Inſtruments: But they are too high-ſet for me a vaſt deal.</p>
                  <p>The beſt thing, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> always ſevere upon her poor Nephew, thou ever ſaidſt. The Muſick muſt be equal to that of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> which can make ſuch a Savage as thee dance to it. I charge thee, ſay not another Word To-night.</p>
                  <p>Why, indeed, Aunt, return'd he, laughing, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it <hi>was</hi> pretty well ſaid for your fooliſh Fellow: Tho' it was by Chance, I muſt confeſs: I did not think of it.</p>
                  <p>That I believe, reply'd my Lady;—if thou hadſt, thou'dſt not have ſpoken ſo well.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> afterwards fell into a Family Diſcourſe; and Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> gave us an Account of two or three Courtſhips <hi>by</hi> his three Sons, and <hi>to</hi> his two Daughters, and his Reaſons for diſallowing them: And I could obſerve, he is an abſolute Tyrant in his Family, tho' they are all Men and Women grown, and he ſeem'd to pleaſe himſelf how much they ſtood in Awe of him.</p>
                  <p>One odd Piece of Converſation I muſt tell you, Miſs, becauſe of the Inference that followed it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:0272600703:339"/>Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> asked Mr. <hi>B.</hi> If he did not remember <hi>John Wilkins,</hi> his Steward? He was an honeſt Fellow, ſaid he, as ever liv'd.—But he's dead. Alas for him, poor <hi>Jack!</hi>—He phyſicked himſelf out of his Life.—He would be always taking Slops: Had I done ſo, I ſhould have gone to the Dogs long ago.—But whom do you think, Nephew, I've got in his Place? — Nay, you can't know him neither. Why, 'tis <hi>Jerry Sherwood,</hi> a Boy I took upon Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and taught to write and read, or paid for't, and that's the ſame thing—Hay, you know!—And now <hi>Jerry</hi>'s a Gentleman's Fellow, and is much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by all our Hunters; for he's a keen Sportſman, I'll aſſure you. I brought him up to that myſelf, and many a Jirk has the Dog had from me, before I could make any thing of him. Many and many a good time have I whacked the Raſcal's Jacket; and he owes all he is, and will be, to me: And I now ſuffer him to ſit down at Table with me, when I have no Gueſts.</p>
                  <p>But is not this a bad Example, ſaid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſo low a Servant to the Command of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, under you? What do <hi>Gentlemen</hi> ſay to this?</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen ſay to it!—Why, what Gentlemen have any thing to do with my Family Management?— Surely, I may do as I will in my own Houſe, and in my own Family; or elſe it would be very hard.</p>
                  <p>True, Sir <hi>Jacob</hi>; but People will be meddling, where they have leaſt Buſineſs. But are not all the Gentlemen uneaſy, for fear their <hi>loweſt Servants,</hi> from the Example ſet by ſo leading a Man as you, a Chairman of the Seſſions, a Colonel of Militia, a Deputy Lieutenant, and a Juſtice of Quorum, ſhould want to be made their <hi>Stewards?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why, I can't ſay that any body has taken it into their Heads to queſtion me upon this Subject. I ſhould
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0272600703:340"/>
think 'em plaguy impertinent, if they had, and bid them mind their own Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>But you'll allow, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> that every one who knows you have rais'd your Foot-boy to be your Steward, will not know your <hi>Inducements</hi>; altho', I doubt not, they are very good ones.</p>
                  <p>Lady <hi>Davers</hi> ſhook her Head at her Brother, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Very well, Sir; very well!</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> cry'd out, O ho, Nephew! are you thereabouts with your Bears? Why, I can't ſay, but you're <hi>in</hi> with me now.—Let's ſee, what have I ſaid? — Ay, by my Soul, you have nabbed me cleverly. Faith and Troth, you have convinc'd me by an Example of my own, that I was impertinent to trouble my Head about the Management of your Family.—Tho' near Kindred makes ſome Excuſe for me too.—And, beſides, a <hi>Steward</hi> and a <hi>Wife</hi> are two Things.</p>
                  <p>So I'd have 'em be, Sir <hi>Jacob:</hi> But a good Wife is but a Steward to her Husband, in many Caſes; and mine is the beſt that ever Gentleman had.</p>
                  <p>Pretty expenſive ones, Nephew, for all that, as the World runs.—Moſt Gentlemen find, I believe, theſe Sort of Stewards run 'em out more than they ſave: But that's not your Caſe, I dare ſay.—I'faith, tho', you have nicked me cleverly, that you have.</p>
                  <p>But, my witty Brother, ſaid my Lady, I believe you'd better, for all your Fling at me, as to <hi>Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> ſtick to your firſt Defence, as to the Example ſake; for, who ſtands upon Birth or Degree in the Office of a Steward?</p>
                  <p>It will anſwer ſeveral Purpoſes, Siſter, and come nearer the Point in what you object, than you are aware of, were we to diſpute upon it. But I have gain'd my End in the Obſervation: Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> takes the Force of the Compariſon, and is convinced, I dare ſay, there is ſome Juſtice in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0272600703:341"/>Ay, ay, a great deal, ſaid Sir <hi>Jacob</hi>; for a Wife is, or ought to be, her Husband's Steward. I'm ſure, when mine was living, I made her ſo, and had no other; for ſhe made Memorandums, and I digeſted them into Book; and yet ſhe brought me a noble Fortune too, as you all know.</p>
                  <p>Here I conclude my tedious Narrations.—Be ſo good as to skim them over lightly, that you may not think the worſe of me; and then return them to me, (with ſome of your charming Penmanſhip) that I may ſend them on to <hi>Kent.</hi> To be ſure I would not have been ſo tediouſly trifling, but for the Sake of my dear Parents; And there is ſo much Self-praiſe, as it may ſeem, from a Perſon repeating the fine Things ſaid of herſelf, that I am half of Opinion I ſhould ſend them to <hi>Kent</hi> only, and to think you ſhould be obliged to me for ſaving you ſo much Trouble and Impertinence.</p>
                  <p>Do, dear Miſs, be ſo free as to forbid me to ſend you any more long Journals, but common Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters only, of How do you? and Who and who's together, and of Reſpects to one, and to another, and ſo forth—Letters that one might diſpatch, as Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> ſays, in a <hi>Twinkling,</hi> and perhaps be more to the Purpoſe, than the tedious Scrawl, which kiſſes your Hands, from,</p>

               <p>I MUST recapitulate the Pleaſure you have given us in your charming Accounts of your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations with your <hi>London</hi> Gueſts, and the Verſes put ſo boldly, and wickedly under your Seat; and your juſt Obſervations on the Lines, and the Occaſion.

<q>But, Oh! forgive me, Heav'n, if oft my Fair.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I am quite ſhock'd, when I think of Lady <hi>Davers</hi>'s paſſionate Intentions, at her firſt coming down to you to the Hall, but have let nobody into the worſt of the Matter, in Compliance with your Deſire. We are delighted with your Account of Family Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and your <hi>Sunday</hi>'s Service.—What an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Lady are you! And how happy, and how good you make every one who knows you, is ſeen by the Ladies joining in your Evening Service, as well as their Servants.</p>
               <p>We go on here ſwimmingly with our Courtſhip. Never was there a fonder Couple than Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> and Miſs <hi>Nancy.</hi> The moody Girl is quite alive, eaſy and pleas'd, except now-and-then with me.— We had a ſad Falling-out t'other Day. Thus it was:</p>
               <p>She had the Aſſurance, on my ſaying, they were ſo fond and ſo free before-hand, that they would leave nothing for Improvement afterwards; to tell me, She had for ſome time perceived, that my Envy was very diſquieting to me. This she ſaid before Mr. <hi>Murray,</hi> who had the good Manners to retire, ſeeing a Storm riſing between us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:0272600703:343"/>Poor, fooliſh Girl! cry'd I, when he was gone, provok'd to great Contempt by her Expreſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, Thou wilt make me deſpiſe thee, in ſpite of my Heart.—But pr'ythee, manage thy Matters with common Decency, at leaſt.</p>
               <p>Good lack! <hi>Common Decency!</hi> I ſay, <hi>Common Decency!</hi> When my Siſter <hi>Polly</hi> is able to ſhew me what it is, I ſhall hope to be better for her Example.</p>
               <p>No, thou'lt never be better for any body's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample! Thy Ill-nature and Perverſeneſs will keep thee from that, as it has always hitherto done.</p>
               <p>My Ill-temper you have often told me is <hi>natural</hi> to me; ſo it muſt become me: But upon ſuch a ſweet-temper'd young Lady as Miſs <hi>Polly,</hi> it ſits but ill!</p>
               <p>I muſt have had no bad Temper, and that every one ſays, to bear with thy ſullen and perverſe one, as I have done, all my Life.</p>
               <p>But why can't you bear with it a little longer, Siſter?—Does any thing provoke you <hi>now,</hi> with a ſly Leer, and affected Drawl, that did not <hi>formerly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Provoke me!—What ſhould provoke me?—I gave thee but a Hint of thy fond Folly, which makes thee behave ſo before Company, that every one ſmiles at thee; and I'd be glad to ſave thee from Contempt for thy <hi>new</hi> good Humour, as I uſed to try to do, for thy <hi>old</hi> bad Nature.</p>
               <p>Is that it?—What a kind Sister have I!—But perhaps I ſee it vexes you; and <hi>ill-natured</hi> Folks love to teize, you know.—But, dear <hi>Polly,</hi> don't let the Affection Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> expreſſes for me, put ſuch a good-temper'd Body out of Humour, pray don't.— Who knows, (continued the Provoker, who never ſays a tolerable thing that is not ill-natur'd, that being her Talent) but the Gentleman may think himſelf happy, that he has found a way with ſo much Eaſe to diſpenſe with the Difficulty that Elderſhip laid
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0272600703:344"/>
him under?—But as he did you the Favour to let the Repulſe come from you, don't be angry, Siſter, that he took you at the <hi>firſt</hi> Word.</p>
               <p>Indeed, indeed, ſaid I with a contemptuous Smile, thou'rt right, <hi>Nancy,</hi> to take the Gentleman at <hi>his</hi> firſt Word. Hold him faſt, and play over all thy Monkey Airs with him, with all my Heart: Who knows but it may engage him more? For ſhould he leave thee, I might be too much provok'd at thy Ingratitude to <hi>turn over</hi> another Gentleman to thee —And, let me tell you, without ſuch an Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thy Temper would keep any body from thee, that knows it.</p>
               <p>Poor Miſs <hi>Polly!</hi>—Come, be as eaſy as you can! —Who knows but we may find out ſome Couſin or Friend of Mr. <hi>Murray</hi>'s between us, that we may <hi>perſuade</hi> to addreſs you? Don't make us your Enemies: We'll try to make you eaſy, if we can— 'Tis a little hard, that you ſhould be ſo cruelly taken at your Word, that it is.</p>
               <p>Doſt think, ſaid I, poor, ſtupid, ill-judging <hi>Nancy,</hi> that I can have the ſame Regret for parting with a Man I could not like, that thou hadſt, when thy vain Hopes met with the Repulſe they deſerved from Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> come up again! I have not heard of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> a great while!</p>
               <p>No, but it was neceſſary, reply'd I, that one Nail ſhould drive out another; for thou'dſt been repining ſtill, had not Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> been <hi>turn'd over</hi> to thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turn'd over!</hi> you us'd that Word once before, Siſter: Such great Wits as you, methinks, ſhould not uſe the ſame Word ſo often.</p>
               <p>How doſt <hi>thou</hi> know what Wits <hi>ſhould,</hi> or ſhould <hi>not</hi> do? Thou haſt no Talent but Ill-nature, and 'tis enough for thee, that one View takes up thy whole Thought. Purſue that—But I would only cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0272600703:345"/>
thee, that thou doſt not <hi>ſatiate</hi> where thou wouldſt <hi>oblige,</hi> that's all: Or if thy Man can be ſo groſs, as to like thy Fondneſs, that thou leaveſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for <hi>Hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I'll call him in again, Siſter, and you ſhall acquaint us how you'd have it. <hi>Bell,</hi> for the Maid came in juſt then, tell Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> I deſire him to walk in.</p>
               <p>I'm glad to ſee thee ſo teachable all at once!— I find out now what was the Cauſe of thy conſtant Perverſeneſs: For had the unavailing Leſſons, my Mamma was always inculcating upon thee, come from a <hi>Man</hi> thou couldſt have had Hopes of, they had ſucceeded better.</p>
               <p>In came Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> with his Crutch-Stick—But can you bear this Nonſenſe, Mrs. <hi>B.?</hi>—What! ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, jangling again, you Sluts!—O what fiery Eyes on one ſide! and contemptuous Looks on t'other!</p>
               <p>Why, Papa, my Siſter <hi>Polly</hi> has <hi>turn'd over</hi> Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> to me, and ſhe wants him back again, and he won't come—That's all the Matter!</p>
               <p>You know your Daughter <hi>Nancy,</hi> Papa—She could never <hi>bear</hi> Reproof, and yet would always <hi>deſerve</hi> it!—I was only gently remarking for her Inſtruction, on her Fondneſs before Company, and ſhe is as ſhe <hi>uſed to be!</hi>—The poor Girl has not indeed been uſed to be courted, and ſo knows not how to behave herſelf.</p>
               <p>So, <hi>Polly,</hi> becauſe you have been able to run over a long Liſt of humble Servants, you muſt inſult your Siſter, muſt you?—But are you really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, <hi>Polly?</hi>—Hay!</p>
               <p>Sir, this or any thing, is very well from you.— But theſe Imputations of Envy, before Mr. <hi>Murray,</hi> muſt make the Man very conſiderable with himſelf. Poor <hi>Nancy</hi> don't conſider that.—But indeed how ſhould ſhe? How ſhould <hi>ſhe</hi> be able to reflect, who knows not what Reflection is, except of the ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0272600703:346"/>
Sort? But, Papa, ſhould the poor Thing add to <hi>his</hi> Vanity, which wants no Addition, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of <hi>her own?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaw her affected, and was reſolv'd to purſue my Advantage.</p>
               <p>Pr'ythee, <hi>Nancy,</hi> continu'd I, canſt thou not have a <hi>little</hi> Patience, Child?— My Papa will ſet the Day as ſoon as he ſhall think it proper. And don't let thy Man toil to keep Pace with thy Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for I have pity'd him many a time, when I have ſeen him ſtretched on the Tenters to keep thee in Countenance.</p>
               <p>This ſet the ill-natur'd Girl into Tears and Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; all her old Temper came upon her, as I deſign'd it ſhould; for ſhe had kept me at Bay longer than uſual; and I left her under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it; and becauſe I would not come into a freſh Diſpute, got my Mamma's Leave, and the Chariot, and went and begg'd a Dinner at Lady <hi>Jones</hi>'s; and then came home as cool and as eaſy, as I us'd to be, and found <hi>Nancy</hi> as ſullen and ſilent as was her Cuſtom, before Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> tendered himſelf to her ready Acceptance. But I went to my Spinnet, and ſuffer'd her to ſwell on.</p>
               <p>We have ſaid nothing but No, and Yes ever ſince; And I wiſh I was with you for a Month, and all their Nonſenſe over without me. I am, my dear, obliging, and excellent Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>

                  <salute>
                     <hi>My dear Mrs.</hi> B.</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>PRAY give my Service to your Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and tell him, he is very unpolite, in his Reflections <note n="*" place="bottom">See this <hi>Vol.</hi> p. <hi>265.</hi>
                  </note> upon me, in relation to Mr. <hi>Murray,</hi> when he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes I regret the Loſs of him. You are much more favourable and juſt too, I will ſay, to your <hi>Polly Darnford.</hi> Theſe Gentlemen, the very beſt of them, are ſuch Indelicates! They think ſo highly of their ſaucy Selves, and confident Sex, as if a Lady cannot from <hi>her Heart</hi> deſpiſe them. But if ſhe turns them off, as they deſerve, and happens to continue her Diſlike, what ſhould be interpreted in her Favour, as a juſt and <hi>regular</hi> Piece of Conduct, is turn'd againſt her, and it muſt proceed from Spite.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may think he knows a good deal of the Sex. But perhaps, were I as malicious as he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting, (and yet, if I have any Malice, he has raiſed it) I could ſay, That his Acquaintance was not with the moſt unexceptionable, till he had the Happineſs to know you: And he has not long enough been happy in you, I find, to do Juſtice to thoſe who are proud to emulate your Virtues.</p>
               <p>But I can't bear, <hi>it ſeems,</hi> to ſee my Siſter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd and complimented, and preferr'd by one whom I had thought in my own Power! But he <hi>may</hi> be miſtaken: With all his Sagacity, he <hi>has been</hi> often. Nor is it ſo mortifying a thing to me, as he imagines, to ſit and ſee two ſuch Anticks playing
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0272600703:348"/>
their Pugs Tricks, as he calls them, with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>But you hardly ever ſaw <hi>ſuch</hi> Pug's Tricks play'd as they play, at ſo early a Time of Courtſhip. The Girl hangs upon his Arm, and receives his empty Head on her Shoulder, already, with a Freedom that would be cenſurable in a Bride, before Folks. A ſtiff, ſullen, proud, ſcornful Girl, as ſhe uſed to be, ſhe now puts on Airs that are not natural either to her Features or her Character; and judge then how it muſt diſguſt one; eſpecially when one ſees her Man ſo proud and vain upon it, that, like a true Man, he treats her with the leſs Ceremony for her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſions, putting on Airs of Conſequence, while her Eaſineſs of Behaviour makes him ſecure of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and a kind Reception, let him be as neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent or as forward as he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>I ſay, Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> there can be no living with theſe Men upon ſuch Beginnings.—They ought to know their Diſtance, or be taught it; and not to think it in their Power to confer that as a Favour, which they ſhould think it an Honour to receive.</p>
               <p>But neither can I bear, <hi>it ſeems,</hi> the Preparatives to Matrimony, the fine Cloaths, the Compliments, the buſy Novelty, as he calls it, the new Equipages, and ſo forth. That's his Miſtake again, tell him: For one, who can look forwarder than the Nine Days of Wonder, can eaſily deſpiſe ſo flaſhy and ſo tranſient a Glare. And were I fond of Compliments, it would not perhaps be the way to be pleaſed, if I were to marry.</p>
               <p>Compliments in the ſingle State are a Lady's Due, whether courted or not; and ſhe receives them, or ought always to receive them, as ſuch: But in Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they are pour'd out upon one, like a haſty Shower, that one knows will ſoon be over!—A mighty comfortable Conſideration this, to a Lady
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0272600703:349"/>
who <hi>loves to be complimented!</hi>—Inſtead of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing <hi>April</hi>-like Showers, which beautify the Sunſhine, ſhe ſhall ſtand a Deluge of Complaiſance, be wet to the Skin with it; and then—What then!— Why be in a <hi>Libyan</hi> Deſart ever after—; experience a conſtant parching Drought, and all her fine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes will be ſwallow'd up in the Quickſands of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.</p>
               <p>It may be otherwiſe with you; and it <hi>muſt</hi> be otherwiſe; becauſe there is ſuch an infinite Variety in your Excellence. Every riſing Sun adorns you with ſome new Rays, and ſets not, without leaving you brighter than he himſelf can hold it.—But does Mr. <hi>B.</hi> think it muſt be ſo in <hi>every</hi> Matrimony?</p>
               <p>'Tis true, he improves every Hour, as I ſee in your kind Papers, in his fine Speeches to you. But it could not be Mr. <hi>B.</hi> if he did not: Your Merit <hi>extorts</hi> it from him: And what an ingrateful, as well as abſurd Churl, would he be, who ſhould ſeek to obſcure a meridian Luſtre, that dazles the Eyes of every one elſe?</p>
               <p>But, let me obſerve, moreover, that you had ſo few of theſe fine Speeches <hi>before-hand,</hi> that you have all the Reaſon in the World to expect them <hi>now:</hi> And this leſſens his Merit a good deal, as the moſt he can ſay, is but common Juſtice, on <hi>full Preof</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, can the like Generoſity be attributed to him, as might to a Gentleman who praiſes <hi>on Truſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You promiſe, if I will come to you, you will join with me againſt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> on this Subject. 'Tis very kindly offer'd: but when Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I expect very little Aſſiſtance from you, be the Argument what it will.</p>
               <p>But 'tis not <hi>my</hi> Fault, I don't come. I am quite tir'd with the perverſe Folly of this <hi>Nancy</hi> of ours. She every Day behaves <hi>more</hi> like a Fool to Mr. <hi>Murray,</hi> and <hi>leſs</hi> like a Siſter to me, and takes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0272600703:350"/>
to teize and vex me, by all the little ways in her Power. And then Surlineſs and Ill-temper are ſo natural to her, that I, who can but throw out a ſpiteful Word, by way of Flouriſh, as I may ſay, and 'tis over, and I am ſorry for it as ſoon as ſpoken, am no Match for her—For ſhe <hi>perſeveres</hi> ſo intolerably, and comes back to the Attack, tho' never ſo often repuls'd, riſing like <hi>Antaeus,</hi> with freſh Vigour for every Fall, or like the <hi>Lernaean Hydra,</hi> which had a new Head ſprouting up, as faſt as any one of the Seven was lopt off, that there is no bearing her. Wedlock, in fine, muſt be her <hi>Hercules,</hi> and will furniſh me, I doubt, with a Revenge I wiſh not for.</p>
               <p>But let me thank you for your delightful Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and beg you to continue them. I told you how your <hi>Saturday's</hi> Converſation with Lady <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and your <hi>Sunday</hi> Imployments, charm us all: So regular, and ſo eaſy to be perform'd!—That's the delightful thing.— What every body may do! — And yet ſo beautiful, ſo laudable, ſo uncommon in the Practice, eſpecially among People in genteel Life!</p>
               <p>Your Converſation and Deciſion in relation to the two Parſons (more than charm) tranſport us. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> let me tell you, judges right, and acts a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Part, to throw ſuch a fine Game into your Hands. And ſo excellently do you play it, that never ſurely was ſo happy a Couple!</p>
               <p>He has a prodigious Merit <hi>with</hi> me, I can tell him, tho' he thinks not ſo well <hi>of</hi> me as I would have him. To <hi>ſee,</hi> to <hi>praiſe,</hi> and to <hi>reward</hi> a Virtue, is <hi>next</hi> to having it <hi>one's ſelf:</hi> And, in time, he will make as good a <hi>Man</hi> (theſe fine Appearances encourage one to hope ſo) as he is a <hi>Husband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Notions of Diſpenſations, and double Livings, are admirably juſt. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> is more
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0272600703:351"/>
my Favourite than ever!—And the amply-rewarded Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> how did that Scene affect us!</p>
               <p>Again, and again, I ſay, (for what can I ſay elſe, or more — ſince I can't find Words to ſpeak all I think?) you're a charming Lady! —Yet, methinks, poor Mr. <hi>H.</hi> makes but a ſorry Figure among you.</p>
               <p>We are delighted with Lady <hi>Davers</hi>; but ſtill more, if poſſible, with the Counteſs: She is a fine Lady, as you have drawn her; but your Characters, tho' Truth and Nature, are the moſt ſhocking, or the moſt amiable, that ever I read.</p>
               <p>We are full of Impatience to hear of the Arrival of Sir <hi>Jacob Swynford.</hi> We know his Character pretty well: But when he has ſat for it to your Pencil, it muſt be an Original indeed.</p>
               <p>I will have another Trial with my Papa, to move him to let me attend you. I am rallying my Forces for that Purpoſe: I have got my Mamma on my Side again; who is concern'd to ſee her Girl vexed and inſulted by her younger Siſter; and who yet minds no more what <hi>ſhe</hi> ſays to her, than what <hi>I</hi> ſay; and Sir <hi>Simon</hi> loves at his Heart to make Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief between us, inſtead of interpoſing to ſilence either: And truly, I am afraid, the Delight of this kind, which he takes, will make him deny his <hi>Polly</hi> what ſhe ſo ardently wiſhes for.</p>
               <p>I had a good Mind to be ſick, to be with you. I could faſt two or three Days, to give it the better Appearance; but then my Mamma, who loves not Deceit, would blame me, if ſhe knew my Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem; and be grieved, if ſhe thought I was really ill. — I know, Faſting, when one has a Stomach to eat, gives one a very gloomy and mortify'd Air.</p>
               <p>What would not one do, in ſhort, to procure to one's ſelf the inexpreſſible Pleaſure that I ſhould have in your Company and Converſation? But
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0272600703:352"/>
continue to write to me till then, however, and that will be <hi>next Beſt.</hi> I am</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Am all over Joy and Rapture. My good Papa has given me Leave to tell you, that he will put his <hi>Polly</hi> under your Protection, when you go to <hi>London.</hi> If you have but a Tenth Part of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I have on this Occaſion, I am ſure I ſhall be as welcome as I wiſh. But he will inſiſt upon it, he ſays, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſigns ſome Acknowlegement, which I am to carry along with <hi>me,</hi> that I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to his Honour and yours, and to be returned to him <hi>Heart-whole,</hi> and <hi>Dutiful,</hi> and with a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as unſully'd as he receives me.</p>
               <p>But do, deareſt Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> continue your Journals till then; for I have promis'd to take them up where you leave off, to divert our Friends in theſe Parts. There will be Preſumption! But yet I will write nothing but what I will ſhew you, and have your Conſent to ſend: For I was taught early not to tell Tales out of School; and a School, the beſt I ever went to, will be your charming Converſation.</p>
               <p>We have been greatly diverted with the Trick put upon that Barbarian Sir <hi>Jacob.</hi> His Obſtinacy, Repentance, and Amendment, follow'd ſo irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibly in one Half-hour, from the happy Thought of the excellent Lady Counteſs, that I think no Plot was ever more fortunate. It was like ſpringing a lucky Mine in a Siege, that blew up twenty times more than was expected from it, and anſwer'd all the Beſieger's Ends at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:0272600703:353"/>Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Defence of his own Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, is quite noble; and he judges with his uſual Generoſity and good Senſe, when, by adding to your Honour, he knows he inhances his own. Mr. <hi>Pitt</hi>'s fine Diamond met with a world of Admirers; but all turn'd upon this Reflection, What a happy Man is Mr. <hi>Pitt,</hi> who can call ſuch a Jewel his own!—How greatly do you excel this Diamond; and how much does Mr. <hi>B.</hi> outdo Mr. <hi>Pitt!</hi>— Who has contributed to give ſo rich a Jewel a Poliſh ſo admirable; and then has ſet it in ſo noble a Light, as makes its Beauty conſpicuous to every Eye!</p>
               <p>You bid me skim over your Writings lightly; bur 'tis impoſſible. I will not flatter you, my dear Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> nor will I be ſuſpected to do ſo; and yet I cannot find Words to praiſe, ſo much as I think you deſerve: So I will only ſay, that your good Parents, for whoſe Pleaſure you write as well as for mine, cannot receive or read them with more Delight than I do—Even my Siſter <hi>Nancy,</hi> judge of their Effect by this! will at any time leave <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi> and forget to frown or be ill-natur'd, while ſhe can hear read what you write—And, angry as ſhe makes me ſometimes, I cannot deny her this Pleaſure, becauſe poſſibly, among the innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able improving Reflections they abound with, ſome one may poſſibly dart in upon her, and illuminate her, as your Converſation and Behaviour did Sir <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But your Application in P. S. to my Papa pleaſed him, and confirmed his Reſolution to let me go—He ſnatched the Sheet that contained this; That's to me! ſaid he: —I muſt read this myſelf; He did—and ſaid—I'faith, ſhe's a ſweet one! — <hi>Do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dear good Sir</hi> Simon, repeated he aloud, <hi>let Miſs</hi> Polly <hi>add to our Delights!</hi>—So ſhe ſhall then;
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0272600703:354"/>
—If that will do it!—And yet this ſame Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> has ſo many Delights already, that I ſhould think ſhe might be contented.—But, Dame <hi>Darnford,</hi> I think I'll let her go. Theſe Siſters then, you'll ſee, how they'll love at a Diſtance, tho' always quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling when together. He read on—<hi>The new Affair will divert you —Lady</hi> Darnford <hi>has conſented— Miſs is willing; and her Siſter can ſpare her</hi>—Very prettily put, faith—<hi>And don't you be ſo croſs</hi>—Very ſweet!—<hi>to deny me!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, dear Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> I won't be ſo croſs, then; indeed I won't!—And ſo, <hi>Polly,</hi> let 'em ſend Word when <hi>they</hi> ſet out for <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>you</hi> ſhall join 'em there, with all my Heart: But I'll have a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter every Poſt, remember that, Girl.</p>
               <p>Any thing, any thing, dear Papa, ſaid I; ſo I can but go! He called for a Kiſs, for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance. I gave it moſt willingly, you may believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nancy</hi> looked envious, altho' Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> came in juſt then—She look'd almoſt like a great Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, whom I remember, one Sir <hi>Jonathan Smith,</hi> who killed himſelf by eating: He us'd, while he was heaping up his Plate from one Diſh, to watch the others, and follow the Knife of every Body elſe, with ſuch a greedy Eye, as if he could ſwear a Robbery againſt any one who preſumed to eat as well as he. This is a groſs Simile; but all greedy and envious Folks look alike about the Eyes; and, thinking of <hi>Nancy</hi> on this Occaſion, (who envied a Happineſs ſhe knew I preferred to that ſhe has in Proſpect). I could not but call to mind Sir <hi>Jonathan</hi> at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Well, let's know when you ſet out, and you ſhan't have been a Week in <hi>London,</hi> if I can help it, but you ſhall be told by my Tongue, as now by my Pen, how much I am</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I NOW proceed with my Journal, which I had brought down to <hi>Thurſday</hi> Night.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>FRIDAY.</head>
                  <p>The two Ladies reſolving, as they ſaid, to inſpect all my Proceedings, inſiſted upon it, that I would take them with me in my <hi>benevolent Round,</hi> as they, after we return'd, would call it, which I ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally take once a Week, among my poor and ſick Neighbours; and finding I could not get off, I ſet out with them, my Lady Counteſs propoſing Mrs. <hi>Worden</hi> to fill up the fourth Place in the Coach.</p>
                  <p>We talked all the Way of Charity, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that Duty; and my Lady <hi>Davers</hi> took Notice of the Text, that it would hide a <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Faults.</hi> And if, as ſhe was pleaſed to ſay, there was to be any Truth in the Popiſh Doctrine of Supererogation, what abundance of <hi>ſuch</hi> Merits would ariſe from the Life and Actions of our dear Friend here! kindly looking at me.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid, That when we had the Pleaſure to reflect, that we ſerved a Maſter, who exacted no hard Terms from us, but in every Caſe almoſt that could be thought of, only required of us to do Juſtice, and ſhew Mercy, to one another, and gave us Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think he would judge us by thoſe Rules, it muſt be a mighty Inducement to Acts of Charity
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0272600703:356"/>
and Benevolence. But indeed, added I, were there not that Inducement, the Pleaſure that attends ſuch Acts, is an high Reward; and I am ſure the Ladies I have the Honour to ſpeak to, muſt have found it in an hundred Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs ſaid, She had once a much better Opinion of herſelf, than ſhe found ſhe had Reaſon for, within theſe <hi>few Days</hi> paſt: And indeed Mrs. <hi>B</hi> ſaid ſhe, when I get home, I ſhall make a good many People the better for your Example. And ſo ſaid Lady <hi>Davers</hi>; which gave me no ſmall inward Pleaſure; and I acknowleg'd, in ſuitable Terms, the Honour they both did me.</p>
                  <p>The Coach ſet us down by the Side of a large Common, about five Miles diſtant from our Houſe; and we alighted, and walked a little Way, chuſing not to have the Coach come nearer, that we might be taken as little Notice of as poſſible; and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with me into two mean Cots with great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion and Goodneſs; one belonging to a poor Widow, and five Children, who had been all down in Agues and Fevers; the other, to a Man and his Wife, Bed-rid with Age and Infirmities, and two honeſt Daughters, one a Widow with two Children, the other married to an Husbandman, who had alſo been ill, but now, by comfortable Cordials, and good Phyſick, were pretty well, to what they had been.</p>
                  <p>The two Ladies were well pleaſed with my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour to the good Folks: To whom I ſaid, that as I ſhould go ſoon to <hi>London,</hi> I was willing to ſee them before I went, to wiſh them better and better, and to tell them, that I ſhould leave Orders with Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> concerning them, to whom they muſt make known their Wants; and that Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> would take care of 'em, I was
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0272600703:357"/>
ſure; and do all that was in the Power of Phyſick for the Reſtoration of their Healths.</p>
                  <p>Now you muſt know, Miſs, that I am not ſo good as the old Ladies of former Days, who uſed to diſtil Cordial Waters, and prepare Medicines, and diſpenſe them themſelves. I knew, if I was ſo inclined, my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would not have been pleaſed with it, becauſe, in the Approbation he has kindly given to my preſent Method, he has twice or thrice praiſed me, that I don't carry my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Extremes, and make his Houſe a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory. I would not, therefore, by aiming at do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much, loſe the Opportunity of doing any Good at all in theſe reſpects; and beſides, as the vulgar Saying is, One muſt creep before one goes! But this is my Method:</p>
                  <p>I am upon an Agreement with this Mr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> who is deemed a very skilful and honeſt Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, and one Mr. <hi>Simmonds,</hi> a Surgeon of like Character, to attend all ſuch Caſes and Perſons as I ſhall recommend; Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> to adminiſter Phyſick and Cordials, as he ſhall judge proper, and even, in neceſſary Caſes, to call in a Phyſician. And now-and-then calling one's ſelf, or ſending a Servant to ask Queſtions, all is kept right.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, one can take this Method without the Oſtentation, as ſome would deem it, which would attend the other; and having one's dear Friend's Gate always crouded with unhappy Objects, and ſome that deſerve no Countenance, perhaps, and would poſſibly be the moſt clamorous: And then one does not ſubject the Poor neither to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of Servants, who ſometimes, in a Body's Abſence, might, were they ſome Servants, ſhew, that they were far from being influenced by the ſame Motives as their Principals: Beſides the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the Poor have from the Skill and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0272600703:358"/>
which Education, and conſtant Practice, give to the Gentlemen I imploy; and with whom I agree but by the Quarter, becauſe if there were a juſt Foundation of Complaint, for Negligence, or Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart, I would not be ty'd down from changing; for, in ſuch Caſes, in a Criſis, the poor People depending on the Aſſiſtance of thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, might look no farther, and ſo my good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might not only be fruſtrated, but do Harm.</p>
                  <p>My Lady <hi>Davers</hi> obſerved a Bible, a Common Prayer Book, and a Whole Duty of Man, in each Cot, in Leathern outſide Caſes, to keep them clean, and a Church Catechiſm or two for the Children; and was pleaſed to ſay, It was right: And her Ladyſhip asked one of the Children, a pretty Girl, Who learnt her her Catechiſm? And ſhe court'ſy'd, and look'd at me; for I <hi>do</hi> ask the Children Queſtions, when I come, to know how they improve: 'Tis as I thought, ſaid my Lady; my Siſter provides for both Parts. God bleſs you, my Dear! ſaid ſhe, and tapp'd my Neck.</p>
                  <p>My Ladies left Tokens of their Bounty behind them to both Families, and all the good Folks bleſſed and pray'd for us at Parting: And as we went out, my Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> with a ſerious Air, was pleaſed to ſay to me, Take care of your Health, my dear Siſter, and God give you, when it comes, a happy Hour; for how many real Mourners would you have, if you were to be called early to reap the Fruits of your Piety?</p>
                  <p>God's Will muſt be done, my Lady, ſaid I. The ſame Providence that has ſo wonderfully put it in my Power to do a little Good, will raiſe up new Friends to the honeſt Hearts that rely upon Him.</p>
                  <p>This I ſaid, becauſe ſome of the good People heard my Lady, and ſeem'd troubled, and began to redouble their Prayers for my Safety and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:0272600703:359"/>We walked thence to our Coach, and ſtretched a little farther, to viſit two Farmers Families, about a Mile diſtant from each other. One had the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Family, with two Sons, juſt recovering, the former from a Fever, the latter from Tertian Agues; and I asked when they ſaw Mr. <hi>Barrow?</hi> They told me, with great Commendations of him, that he had but juſt left them. So having congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated their hopeful Way, and wiſhed them to take care of themſelves, and not go too early to Buſineſs, I ſaid, I ſhould deſire Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> to watch over them, for fear of Relapſe, and ſhould hardly ſee 'em again for ſome time; and ſo, under the Notion of my Foy, I dropt a Couple of Guineas in the good Woman's Hand: For I had had an Hint given me by Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> that their Illneſs had made it low with them.</p>
                  <p>We proceeded then to the other Farm, where the Caſe was a marry'd Daughter, who had had a very dangerous Lying-in, and a wicked Husband, who had abus'd her, and run away from her: But ſhe was mending apace, by good comfortable Things, which from time to time I had cauſed to be ſent her. Her old Father had been a little unkind to her, before I took Notice of her; for ſhe marry'd againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and indeed the World went hard with the poor Man, and he could not do much; and, beſides, he had a younger Daughter, who had loſt all her Limbs, and was forc'd to be ty'd in a Wicker Chair, to keep her up in it; which (having expended much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her) was a great Pull-back, as the good old Woman called it. And having been a Year in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rear to a cruel Landlord, who finding a good Stock upon the Ground, wanted to diſtreſs the poor Family, and turn them out of all, I advanced the Money upon the Stock; and the poor Man has already paid me half of it, (for I muſt keep within Compaſs too,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0272600703:360"/>
Miſs) which was 50 <hi>l.</hi> at firſt, and is in a fair Way to pay me the other Half, and make as much more for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Here I found Mr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> and he gave me an Account of the Succeſs of two other Caſes I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him; and told me, that <hi>John Smith,</hi> a poor Man, who, in thatching a Barn, had tumbled down, and broken his Leg, and bruiſed himſelf all over, was in a fair way of Recovery.</p>
                  <p>This poor Creature had like to have periſhed by the Cruelty of the Pariſh Officers, who would have paſs'd him away to <hi>Eſſex,</hi> where his Settlement was, tho' in a burning Fever, occaſioned by his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But hearing of the Caſe, I directed Mr. <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> to attend him, and provide for him, at my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and gave my Word, if he dy'd, to bury him.</p>
                  <p>I was glad to hear he was in ſo good a way, and told Mr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> I hoped to ſee him and Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> together at Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s, before I ſet out for <hi>London,</hi> that we might adviſe about the Caſes under their Direction, and that I might acquit myſelf of ſome of my Obligations to them.</p>
                  <p>You are a good Man, Mr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> added I: God will bleſs you for your Care and Kindneſs to theſe poor deſtitute Creatures. They all praiſe you, and do nothing but talk of your Humanity to them.</p>
                  <p>O my good Lady, ſaid he, who can forbear fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſuch an Example as you ſet? Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> can teſtify, as well as I, (for now-and-then a Caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to viſit together) that we can hardly hear any Complaints from our poor Patients, let 'em be ever ſo ill, for the Praiſes and Bleſſings they beſtow upon you.</p>
                  <p>It is good Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that enables and encourages me to do what I do. Tell them, they muſt bleſs God, and bleſs him, and pray for me, and thank you and Mr. <hi>Simmonds:</hi> We all join together, you know, for their Good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:0272600703:361"/>The Counteſs and Lady <hi>Davers</hi> asked the poor lying-in Woman many Queſtions, and left with her, and for her poor Siſter, a miſerable Object indeed! —(God be praiſed, that I am not ſuch an one!) Marks of their Bounty in Gold, but I ſaw not how much; and looking upon one another, and then upon me, and lifting up their Hands, could not ſay a Word, till they were in the Coach: And ſo we were carry'd home, after we had juſt look'd in upon a Country School, where I pay for the Learning of Eight Children.</p>
                  <p>And here, Miſs, (—I hope I recite not this with Pride, tho' I do with Pleaſure) is a curſory Account of my <hi>Benevolent Weekly Round,</hi> as my Ladies will call it.</p>
                  <p>I know you will not be diſpleaſed with it; but it will highly delight my worthy Parents, who, in their way, do a great deal of diſcreet Good in their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood: For, indeed, Miſs, a little Matter, <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> beſtowed, and to true Objects of Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (whoſe Caſes are ſoon at a Criſis, as are thoſe of moſt labouring People) will go a great way, and eſpecially if laid out properly for 'em, according to the Exigencies of their reſpective Caſes. — For ſuch poor People, who live generally low, want very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom any thing but reviving Cordials at firſt, and good wholſome Kitchen Phyſick afterwards; and then the Wheels of Nature being unclogg'd, new-oil'd, as it were, and ſet right, they will go round again with Pleaſantneſs and Eaſe, for a good while together, by virtue of that Exerciſe which their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour gives them; while the Rich and Voluptuous are forced to undergo great Fatigues to keep theirs clean and in Order.</p>
                  <p>Thus is it well remarked in a Manuſcript Poem, in my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Poſſeſſion, written in Anſwer to a Friend, who recommended a poor Man of Genius
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0272600703:362"/>
to the Favour of the Author, in order to induce the benevolent Gentleman to lift him into a higher Life than that to which he was born:

                  <head>SATURDAY Morning.</head>
                  <p>IT is hardly right to trouble either of you, my honoured Correſpondents, with an Affair, that has vex'd me a good deal, and indeed <hi>ſhould</hi> affect me more than any other Miſtreſs of a Family, for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which will be obvious to you, when I tell you the Caſe. And this (it is ſo preſent with me) I cannot forbear.</p>
                  <p>A pretty genteel young Body, my <hi>Polly Barlow,</hi> as I call her, having been well recommended, and indeed behaved with great Prudence till this time, is the Occaſion. And this it is:</p>
                  <p>My dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and the Two Ladies agreed with me to take a little Airing in the Coach, and to fall in upon Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> who had a Preſent made him for his Menagerie, in which he takes great Delight,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0272600703:367"/>
of a rare and uncommon Creature, a Native of the <hi>Eaſt Indies.</hi> But juſt as Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> was on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back to accompany them, and the Ladies were ready to go, I was taken with a ſudden Diſorder and Faintiſhneſs, ſo that Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> who is very tender of me, and watches every Turn of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, would not let me go with them, tho' my Diſorder was going off, and my dear Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was pleaſed to excuſe me; and juſt meeting with Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> as they went to the Coach, they took him with them, to fill up the vacant Place. So I retir'd to my Cloſet, and ſhut myſelf in.</p>
                  <p>They had asked Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to go with them, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to Sir <hi>Jacob</hi>; but he (as I believe, by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, on purpoſe) could not be found, when they ſet out: So they ſuppoſed he was upon ſome Ramble with Mr. <hi>Colbrand,</hi> his great Favourite.</p>
                  <p>I was writing to <hi>you,</hi> being pretty well recover'd, when I heard <hi>Polly,</hi> as I ſuppoſed, and as it proved, come into my Apartment; and down ſhe ſat, and ſung a little Catch, and cry'd Hem! twice; and preſently I heard two Voices. But ſuſpecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I wrote on, till I heard a kind of Ruſtling and Struggling, and <hi>Polly</hi>'s Voice crying, Fie! — How can you do ſo! — Pray, Sir!</p>
                  <p>This alarm'd me much, becauſe we have ſuch orderly Folks about us; and I looked thro' the Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole, and, to my Surprize and Concern, ſaw Mr. <hi>H.</hi>— fooliſh Gentleman! — taking Liberties with <hi>Polly,</hi> that neither became him to offer, nor, more fooliſh Girl! her to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>I did not know what to do: But having Reaſon to think, that this was not their firſt Interview and Freedom — and the Girl ſometimes encouragingly laughing, as at other times, inconſiſtently, ſtruggling and complaining, in an Accent that was too tender for the Occaſion, I forced a faint Cough. This
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0272600703:368"/>
frighted them both: Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſwore, and ſaid, Who can that be? — Your Lady's gone with them, i'n't ſhe?</p>
                  <p>I believe ſo! I hope ſo! ſaid the ſilly Girl — Yet that was like her Voice! — Me'm, are you in your Cloſet, Me'm? ſaid ſhe, coming up to the Door, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſtanding, like a poor Thief, half behind the Window-curtains, till he knew if it was I.</p>
                  <p>I open'd the Door; away ſneak'd Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and ſhe leap'd with Surprize, not hoping to find me there, tho' ſhe asked the Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>I thought— Indeed — Me'm—I thought you were gone out.</p>
                  <p>It is plain you did, <hi>Polly!</hi> — Go and ſhut the Chamber-door, and come to me again.</p>
                  <p>She did, but trembled, and was ſo full of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that I pity'd the poor Creature, and hardly knew how to ſpeak to her, or what to ſay. — For my Compaſſion got the Upper-hand of my Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and as ſhe ſtood quaking and trembling, and looking on the Ground, with a Countenance I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſcribe, I now-and-then caſt my Eye upon her, and was as often forced to put my Handkerchief to it.</p>
                  <p>At laſt I ſaid, How long have theſe Freedoms paſt, <hi>Polly,</hi> between you and Mr. <hi>H.?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She ſaid never a Word.</p>
                  <p>I am loth to be cenſorious, <hi>Polly:</hi> But 'tis too plain, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would not have followed you into my Chamber, if he had not met you at other Places before.</p>
                  <p>Still the poor Girl ſaid never a Word.</p>
                  <p>Little did I expect, <hi>Polly,</hi> that you would have ſhewn ſo much Imprudence. You have had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the vile Arts of Men againſt poor Maidens: Have you any Notion, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> intends to do honourably by you?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:0272600703:369"/>Me'm—Me'm—I believe—I hope—I dare ſay, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would not do otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>So much the worſe, that you believe ſo, if you have not very good Reaſon for your Belief. — Does he pretend he will marry you, <hi>Polly?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She was ſilent.</p>
                  <p>Tell me, <hi>Polly,</hi> if he does?</p>
                  <p>He ſays, he will do honourably by me.</p>
                  <p>But you know there is but one Word neceſſary to explain that other precious Word <hi>Honour,</hi> in this Caſe. It is <hi>Matrimony.</hi> That Word's as ſoon ſpoken as any other, and if he <hi>means</hi> it, he will not be ſhy to <hi>ſpeak</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>She was ſilent.</p>
                  <p>Tell me, <hi>Polly,</hi> (for I am really greatly concern'd for you) what you think yourſelf: Do you <hi>hope</hi> he will marry you?</p>
                  <p>She was ſilent.</p>
                  <p>Do, good <hi>Polly,</hi> I hope I may call you <hi>good</hi> yet!— anſwer me.</p>
                  <p>Pray, Madam! and ſhe wept, and turn'd from me, to the Wainſcot—Pray, Madam, excuſe me.</p>
                  <p>But, indeed, <hi>Polly,</hi> I <hi>cannot</hi> excuſe you. You are under my Protection. I was once in as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a Situation as you can be. And I did not eſcape it, Child, by the Language and Conduct I heard from you.</p>
                  <p>Language and Conduct, Me'm!</p>
                  <p>Yes, <hi>Polly,</hi> Language and Conduct. For you have heard my Story, no doubt: All the World has. And do you think, if I had ſat me down in my Lady's Bedchamber, and ſung a Song, and hem'd twice, and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had come to me, upon that Signal, (for ſuch I doubt it was) and I had kept my Place, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd myſelf to be rumpled, and only, in a ſoft Voice, and with an encouraging Laugh, cry'd, How can you do ſo? that I ſhould have been what I am?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:0272600703:370"/>Me'm, I dare ſay, my Lord (ſo all the Servants call him, and his Aunt often, when ſhe puts <hi>Jackey</hi> to it) means me no Hurt.</p>
                  <p>No Hurt, <hi>Polly!</hi> What, and make you cry <hi>Fie!</hi>— Or do you intend to truſt your Honour to his Mercy, rather than to your own Diſcretion?</p>
                  <p>I hope not, Me'm!</p>
                  <p>I hope not too, <hi>Polly!</hi>—But you know he was free enough with you, to make you ſay <hi>Fie!</hi>—And what might have been the Caſe, who knows? had I not coughed on Purpoſe; unwilling for your ſake, <hi>Polly,</hi> to find Matters ſo bad as I feared, and that you would have been led beyond what was reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
                  <p>Reputable, Me'm!</p>
                  <p>Yes, <hi>Polly,</hi> Reputable: I am ſorry you oblige me to ſpeak ſo plain. But your Good requires it. Inſtead of flying from him, you not only laughed all the time you cry'd out, <hi>Fie!</hi> and <hi>How can you do ſo?</hi> but had no other Care then to ſee if any body heard you; and you obſerve how he ſlid away, like a guilty Gentleman, as ſoon as I open'd my Door—Do theſe Things look well, <hi>Polly?</hi> Do you think they do?—And if you hope to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late my good Fortune, do you think <hi>this</hi> is the Way?</p>
                  <p>I wiſh, Me'm, I had never ſeen Mr. <hi>H.</hi> For nobody will look upon me, if I loſe your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour!</p>
                  <p>It will ſtill, <hi>Polly,</hi> (and I took her Hand, with a kind Look) be in your own Power to keep it; and I will not mention this Matter, if you make me your Friend, and tell me all that has paſs'd.</p>
                  <p>Again ſhe wept, and was ſilent.</p>
                  <p>This made me more uneaſy. Don't think, <hi>Polly,</hi> ſaid I, that I would envy any other Perſon's Preferment, when I have been ſo much exalted
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0272600703:371"/>
myſelf. If Mr. <hi>H.</hi> has talked to you of Marriage, tell me.</p>
                  <p>No, Me'm, I cann't ſay, he has <hi>yet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet, Polly!</hi> Then he <hi>never</hi> will. For when Men <hi>do</hi> talk of it, they don't always <hi>mean</hi> it: But whenever they <hi>mean</hi> it, how can they confirm a doubting Maiden, without <hi>mentioning</hi> it? But, alas, alas for you, poor <hi>Polly!</hi>—The Freedoms you have permitted to him, no doubt, previous to thoſe I heard, and which would have been greater poſſibly, had I not ſurpris'd you with my Cough, ſhew too well, that he <hi>need</hi> not make any Promiſes to you.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Me'm—Indeed, ſaid ſhe, ſobbing, I might be too little upon my Guard; but I would not have done any Ill for the World.</p>
                  <p>I hope you would not, <hi>Polly</hi>; but if you ſuffer theſe Freedoms, you can't tell <hi>what</hi> you'd have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted—Tell me, do you love Mr. <hi>H.?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is a very good-humour'd Gentleman, Madam, and is not proud.</p>
                  <p>No, 'tis not his Buſineſs to be proud, when he hopes to humble you—Humble you indeed! Beneath the loweſt Perſon of the Sex, that is honeſt.</p>
                  <p>I hope—</p>
                  <p>You <hi>hope,</hi> interrupted I—You <hi>hope</hi> too much; and I <hi>fear</hi> a <hi>great deal</hi> for you, becauſe you fear <hi>ſo little</hi> for yourſelf—But tell me, How often have you been in private together?</p>
                  <p>In private, Me'm!—I don't know what your Ladyſhip calls <hi>private!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why that is <hi>private, Polly,</hi> when, as juſt now, you neither hoped nor intended any body ſhould ſee you.</p>
                  <p>She was ſilent; and I ſee, Miſs, by this poor Girl, that Lovers are true to their Secret, tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, their Ruin depends upon it. But it behov'd
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0272600703:372"/>
                     <hi>me,</hi> on more Accounts than it would any body elſe, as I hinted before, to examine this Matter narrowly; becauſe, if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhould marry her, it would have been laid upon Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Example— And if my <hi>Polly</hi> ſhould be ruin'd, it would be a ſad thing; and People would have ſaid, Ay, ſhe could take Care enough of herſelf; but none at all of her Servant: <hi>Her</hi> Waiting-maid had a much more remiſs Miſtreſs, than <hi>Pamela</hi> found, or the Matter would not have been thus.</p>
                  <p>Well, <hi>Polly,</hi> I ſee, continued I, that you will not ſpeak out to me. You may have <hi>ſeveral</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, poſſibly, tho' not <hi>one</hi> good one. But as ſoon as Lady <hi>Davers</hi> comes in, who has a great Concern in this Matter, as well as Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> and are anſwerable to Lord <hi>H.</hi> in a Matter of ſo much importance as this, I will leave it to her Ladyſhip's Conſideration, and ſhall no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern myſelf to ask you Queſtions about it—For then I muſt take her Ladyſhip's Directions, and part with you to be ſure.</p>
                  <p>The poor Girl, frighted at this, (for every body fears Lady <hi>Davers</hi>) wrung her Hands, and begg'd, for God's Sake, I would not acquaint Lady <hi>Davers</hi> with it.</p>
                  <p>But how can I help it? ſaid I — Muſt I not connive at your Proceedings, if I do not? You are no Fool, <hi>Polly,</hi> in other Caſes. Tell me, How is it poſſible for me, in my Situation, to avoid it?</p>
                  <p>I will tell your Ladyſhip the whole Truth; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I will—if you will not tell Lady <hi>Davers.</hi> I am ready to ſink at the Thoughts of Lady <hi>Davers</hi>' knowing any thing of this.</p>
                  <p>This looked ſadly. I pity'd her, but yet was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry in my Mind; for I ſaw too plainly, that her Conduct could not bear a Scrutiny, not even in <hi>her own</hi> Opinion, poor Creature!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:0272600703:373"/>I ſaid, Make me acquainted with the Whole.</p>
                  <p>Will your Ladyſhip promiſe—</p>
                  <p>I'll promiſe nothing, <hi>Polly</hi>—When I have heard all you think fit to ſay, I will do what befits me to do; but with as much Tenderneſs as I can for you—and that's all you ought to expect me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>Why then, Madam—But how can I ſpeak it?—I can ſpeak ſooner to any body, but Lady <hi>Davers</hi> and you, Madam—For her Ladyſhip's Paſſion, and your Ladyſhip's Virtue — How ſhall I? — And then ſhe threw herſelf at my Feet, and hid her Face with her Apron.</p>
                  <p>I was in Agonies for her almoſt; I wept over her; I raiſed her up, and ſaid, Tell me all—You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell me worſe than I apprehend, nor, I hope, ſo bad! O <hi>Polly,</hi> tell me ſoon—For you give me great Pain—</p>
                  <p>And my Back, with Grief and Compaſſion for the poor Girl, was ready to open, as it ſeem'd to me—In my former Diſtreſſes, I have been overcome by Fainting next to Death, and was depriv'd of Senſe for ſome Moments—But elſe I ſhould have imagin'd, I muſt have had ſome ſuch affecting Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, as the unhappy Girl's Caſe gave me.</p>
                  <p>Then, Madam, I own, ſaid ſhe, I have been too faulty.</p>
                  <p>As how! — As what!— In what Way!—How faulty?—asked I, as quick as Thought: You are not ruin'd, are you!—Tell me, <hi>Polly?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No, Madam, but—</p>
                  <p>But, what?—Say, but what?</p>
                  <p>I had conſented—</p>
                  <p>To what?</p>
                  <p>To his Propoſals, Madam.</p>
                  <p>What Propoſals?</p>
                  <p>Why, Madam, I was to <hi>live</hi> with Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:0272600703:374"/>I underſtand you too well—But is it too late to break ſo wretched a Bargain?—Have you already made a Sacrifice of your Honour?</p>
                  <p>No, Madam; but I have given it under my Hand.</p>
                  <p>Under your <hi>Hand!</hi>—Ah! <hi>Polly,</hi> if you have not given it under your <hi>Heart</hi> too, it were well. But what Fooliſhneſs is this! What Conſideration has he made you?</p>
                  <p>He has given it under his Hand, that he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways love me, and when his Lordſhip's Father dies, he will own me.</p>
                  <p>What Fooliſhneſs is this, ſaid I, on both ſides! —But are you willing to be releaſed from this vile Bargain?</p>
                  <p>Indeed I am, Madam, and I told him ſo Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. But, he ſays, he will ſue me, and ruin me, if I don't ſtand to it.</p>
                  <p>You are ruin'd if you do!—And I wiſh— But tell me, <hi>Polly,</hi> Are you not ruin'd as it is?</p>
                  <p>Indeed I am not, Madam.</p>
                  <p>I doubt then, ſaid I, you were upon the Brink of it, had not this providential Indiſpoſition kept me at home—You met, I ſuppoſe, to conclude your ſhocking Bargain.—O poor unhappy Girl!—But let me ſee what he has given under his Hand?</p>
                  <p>He has 'em both, Madam, to be drawn up fair, and in a ſtrong Hand, that ſhall be like a Record.</p>
                  <p>Could I have thought, Miſs, that a Girl of Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen could be ſo ignorant and fooliſh in a Point ſo important, when in every thing elſe ſhe has ſhewn no Inſtances like this imprudent Folly?</p>
                  <p>Has he given you Money?</p>
                  <p>Yes, Madam, he gave me—he gave me—a Note. Here it is. He ſays any body will give me Money for it.</p>
                  <p>And this was a Bank Note of 50 <hi>l.</hi> which ſhe pulled out of her Boſom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:0272600703:375"/>I inſtantly thought of thoſe Lines of <hi>Cowley,</hi> which my dear Lady ſeveral times made me read to her; tho' theſe ſuppoſed an infinitely more excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Caſe—<hi>Marriage</hi> for Money.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Take Heed, take Heed, thou lovely Maid!</l>
                     <l>Nor be by glitt'ring Ills betray'd!</l>
                     <l>Thyſelf for Money! O let no Man know</l>
                     <l>The Price of Beauty fall'n ſo low!</l>
                     <l>What Dangers ought'ſt thou not to dread,</l>
                     <l>When Love that's <hi>blind,</hi> is by <hi>blind</hi> Fortune led?</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Reſult was, He was to ſettle 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Year upon her and <hi>hers,</hi> poor, poor Girl!—And he was to <hi>own her,</hi> as ſhe calls it (but as Wife or Miſtreſs, ſhe ſtipulated not) when his Father dy'd, and he came into the Title and Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>I told her, It was impoſſible for me to conceal the Matter from Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> if ſhe would not, by her Promiſes to be govern'd intirely by me, and to abandon all Thoughts of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> give me room to conclude, that the wicked Bargain was at an End.</p>
                  <p>And to keep the poor Soul in ſome Spirits, and to enable her to look up, and to be more eaſy under my Direction, I blamed <hi>him</hi> more than I did <hi>her:</hi> Tho', conſidering what Virtue requires of a Woman, and Cuſtom has made ſhameleſs in a Man, I think the poor Girl inexcuſeable, and ſhall not be eaſy while ſhe is about me. For ſhe is more to blame, becauſe, of the two, ſhe has more Wit than the Man.</p>
                  <p>But what can I do, Miſs, if I put her away? 'Twill be to throw her directly into his Hands. He won't ſtay long; and ſhe <hi>may</hi> ſee her Folly. But here her Eyes were open; She knew what ſhe had to truſt to—And by their wicked Beginning, and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0272600703:376"/>
her encouraging Repulſes, I doubt ſhe would have been utterly ruin'd that very Day.</p>
                  <p>I knew the Rage Lady <hi>Davers</hi> would be in with both. So this was another Embaraſs. And yet, ſhould my good Intentions be fruſtrated, and they ſhould conclude their vile Bargain, and it appear'd that I knew of it, but would not acquaint her, then ſhould I have been blam'd more than any Miſtreſs of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, being circumſtanc'd as I am.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Whole, As to the Girl, I reſolv'd to comfort her as well as I could, till I had gain'd her Confidence, that my Advice might have the more Weight with her, and by Degrees be the more likely to reclaim her: For, poor Soul! there would be an End of her Reputation, the moſt precious of all Jewels, the Moment the Matter was known; and that would be a ſad thing.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Man, I thought it beſt to take Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage (and you that know me, will ſay, I muſt have a good deal more than uſual) to talk to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> on this Subject.</p>
                  <p>And the poor Body conſenting I ſhould, and, with great Proteſtations, declaring her Sorrow and Repentance, begging me to get her Note of Hand again, on which ſhe laid a fooliſh Streſs, and deſiring me to give him back his Note of 50 <hi>l.</hi> I went down to find him.</p>
                  <p>He ſhunn'd me, as a Thief would a Conſtable at the Head of a Hue and Cry. As I entered one Place or Room, he went into another, looking with conſcious Guilt, but yet confidently humming a Tune. At laſt I fixed him ſpeaking to <hi>Rachel,</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her tell <hi>Polly,</hi> he wanted to ſend a Meſſage by her to her Lady. By which I doubted not, he was deſirous to know what ſhe had owned, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to govern himſelf accordingly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="372" facs="tcp:0272600703:377"/>His Back was toward me; and I ſaid, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> here I am myſelf, to take your Commands.</p>
                  <p>He gave a Caper half a Yard high—Madam, I wanted—I wanted to ſpeak to—I would have ſpoken with—</p>
                  <p>You wanted to ſend <hi>Polly</hi> to me, perhaps, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to ask if I would take a little Walk with you in the Garden?</p>
                  <p>Very true, Madam!—Very true indeed!—You have gueſs'd the Matter—I thought it was pity, this fine Day, as every body was taking an Airing—</p>
                  <p>Well then, Sir, pleaſe to lead the Way, and I'll attend you.</p>
                  <p>Yet I fanſy, Madam, the Wind is a little too high for you—Won't you catch Cold?</p>
                  <p>No, never fear, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I am not afraid of a little Air.</p>
                  <p>I will attend you preſently, Madam: You'll be in the great Gravel Walk, or on the Terrace—I'll wait upon you in an Inſtant.</p>
                  <p>I had the Courage to take hold of his Arm, as if I had like to have ſlipt; For, thought I, thou ſhalt not ſee the Girl, worthy Friend, till I have talk'd to thee a little, if thou doſt then —Excuſe me, Mr. <hi>H.</hi>— I hope I have not hurt my Foot!—I muſt lean upon you.</p>
                  <p>Will you be pleas'd, Madam, to have a Chair? I fear you have ſprain'd your Foot—Shall I help you to a Chair?</p>
                  <p>No, no, Sir, I ſhall walk it off, if I hold by you.</p>
                  <p>So he had no Excuſe to leave me, and we proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Garden. But never did any thing look ſo ſilly!—So like a <hi>fooliſh Fellow,</hi> as his Aunt calls him. He looked, if poſſible, half a dozen Ways at once, hem'd, cough'd, wriggled about, turn'd his Head behind him every now-and-then, and ſtarted
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0272600703:378"/>
half a dozen ſilly Subjects, in hopes to hinder me from ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>I appear'd, I believe, under ſome Concern how to begin with him; for he would have it, I was not very well, and begg'd he might ſtep in one Minute, to deſire Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> to attend me.</p>
                  <p>So I reſolved to begin with him, leſt I ſhould loſe the Opportunity, ſeeing my Eel ſo very ſlippery. And placing myſelf at the Seat at the upper End of the Gravel Walk, I asked him to ſit down. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined it, and would wait upon me preſently, he ſaid, and ſeemed going. So I began—It is eaſy for me, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to penetrate the Reaſon why you are ſo willing to leave me: But 'tis for your <hi>own</hi> Sake, that I deſire you to hear me, that no Miſchief may enſue among Friends and Relations, on an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to which you are no Stranger.</p>
                  <p>Lord, Madam, What can you mean?—Surely, Madam, you don't think amiſs of a little innocent Liberty, or ſo!</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> reply'd I, I want not any Evidence of your inhoſpitable Deſigns upon a poor unwary young Creature, whom your Birth and Quality have found it too eaſy a Task to influence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inhoſpitable Deſigns,</hi> Madam!—A harſh Word, by Gad!—You very nice Ladies cannot admit of the leaſt Freedom in the World!—Why, Madam, I have kiſs'd a Lady's Woman before now, in a civil way or ſo, and never was call'd to an Account for it, as a Breach of Hoſpitality.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not for me, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaid I, to proceed to <hi>very nice</hi> Particulars with a Gentleman who can act as you have done, by a poor Girl, that could not have had the Aſſurance to look up to a Man of your Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, had you not levell'd all Diſtinction between you, in order to level the weak Creature to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Dirt of the Highway. I muſt tell you, that the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0272600703:379"/>
poor Girl heartily repents of her Folly; and, to ſhew you, that it ſignifies nothing to deny it, ſhe begs you will give her back the Note of her Hand you have extorted from her Fooliſhneſs; and I hope you'll be ſo much of a Gentleman, as not to keep in your Power ſuch a Teſtimony of the Weakneſs of any of the Sex.</p>
                  <p>Has ſhe told you that, Madam?—Why may-be— indeed—I can't but ſay—Truly it mayn't look ſo well to you, Madam: But young Folks will have Frolicks—It was nothing but a Frolick—Let me <hi>be hang'd,</hi> if it was!</p>
                  <p>Be pleaſed then, Sir, to give up her Note to me to return to her—Reputation ſhould not be frolick'd with, Sir; eſpecially that of a poor Girl, who has nothing elſe to depend upon.</p>
                  <p>I'll give it to her myſelf, and laugh at her into the Bargain, if you pleaſe, Madam. Why, 'tis comical enough, if the little Pug thought I was in Earneſt. I muſt have a Laugh or two at her, Madam, when I give it her up.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaid I, ſince 'tis but a Frolick, you won't take it amiſs, that when we are ſet down to Supper, we call <hi>Polly</hi> in, and demand a Sight of her Note, and that will make every one merry, as well as you.</p>
                  <p>Cot-ſo, Madam, that mayn't be ſo well neither! —For, perhaps, they will be apt to think it is in Earneſt; when, as I hope to live, 'tis but a Jeſt: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World elſe, upon Honour!</p>
                  <p>I put on then a ſtill more ſerious Air—As you <hi>hope to live,</hi> ſay you, Mr. <hi>H.!</hi>— and <hi>upon your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour!</hi>—How fear you not an inſtant Puniſhment for this Appeal! and what is the <hi>Honour</hi> you ſwear by? —Take that, and anſwer me, Sir; Do Gentlemen give away Bank Notes for <hi>Frolicks,</hi> and for <hi>mere Jeſts!</hi> and <hi>nothing in the World</hi> elſe!—I am ſorry to be obliged to deal thus with you. But I thought
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0272600703:380"/>
I was talking to a Gentleman, that would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit his Veracity; and that in ſo ſolemn an Inſtance as this!</p>
                  <p>He looked like a Man Thunder-ſtruck. His Face was diſtorted, and his Head ſeemed to turn about upon his Neck, like a Weathercock in a Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane, to all Points of the Compaſs. His Hands clenched as in a Paſſion, and yet Shame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion ſtruggling in every Limb and Feature.</p>
                  <p>At laſt he ſaid, I am confoundedly betrayed. But if I am expoſed (for the Wretch thought of nobody but himſelf) to my Uncle and Aunt, I am undone, and ſhall never be able to look 'em in the Face. 'Tis true, I had a Deſign upon her; and ſince ſhe has betray'd me, I think I may ſay, that ſhe was as willing, almoſt, as I.</p>
                  <p>Ungenerous, contemptible Wretch, thought I!— But our Sex that can thus give up their Virtue, ought to expect no better: For he that ſticks not at <hi>one</hi> bad Action, will not ſcruple <hi>another</hi> to vindicate himſelf: And ſo, Devil-like, become the Tempter, and the Accuſer too!</p>
                  <p>But if you will be ſo good, ſaid he, as to take no Notice of this, to my Uncle, and eſpecially to my Aunt and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I ſwear to you, I never will think of her as long as I live.</p>
                  <p>And you'll bind this Promiſe, will you, Sir? by <hi>your Honour,</hi> and as you <hi>hope to live!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dear, good Madam, forgive me, I beſeech you; Don't be ſo ſevere upon me. By all that's—</p>
                  <p>Don't ſwear, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> But as an Earneſt that I may believe you, give me back the Girl's fooliſh Note, that, tho' 'tis of no Signification, ſhe may not have <hi>that</hi> to witneſs to her Folly.</p>
                  <p>He took out his Pocket-Book: There it is, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam!—And I beg you'll forgive this Attempt. I ſee, I ought not to have made it. I doubt it was a Breach
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0272600703:381"/>
of the Laws of Hoſpitality, as you ſay. But to make it known, will only expoſe me, and it can do no Good; and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will reſent it, may-be; and my Aunt will never let me hear the laſt of it, nor my Uncle neither—And I ſhall be ſent to travel again—And (added the poor Creature) I was once in a Storm, and the croſſing the Sea again, would be Death to me.</p>
                  <p>What a Wretch art thou, thought I!—What could ſuch an one as thou find to ſay to a poor Creature, that, if put in the Scale againſt Virtue and Honour, ſhould make the latter kick the Beam? —Poor, poor <hi>Polly Barlow!</hi> thou art ſunk indeed! Too low for Excuſe, and almoſt beneath Pity!</p>
                  <p>I told him, if I could obſerve, that nothing paſs'd between them, that ſhould lay me under a Neceſſity of revealing the Matter, I ſhould not be forward to expoſe him, nor the Maiden either. But that he muſt, in his own Judgment, excuſe me, if I made every body acquainted with it, if I were to ſee the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence between them likely to be renewed or carried on: For, added, in that Caſe, I ſhould owe it to myſelf, to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to Lord and Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> and to you, and the unhappy Body too, to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>He would needs drop down on one Knee to promiſe this; and, with a thouſand Acknowlege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, left me, to find Mr. <hi>Colbrand,</hi> in order to ride to meet the Coach on its Return.</p>
                  <p>I went in, and gave the fooliſh Note to the ſilly Girl, which ſhe receiv'd eagerly, and immediately burnt; and I told her, I would not ſuffer her to come near me but as little as poſſible, when I was in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, while Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſtaid; but conſigned her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the Care of Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> to whom only, I ſaid, I would hint the Matter as tenderly as I could: And for this, I added, I had more Reaſons than one; Firſt, To give her the Benefit of a good Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman's
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0272600703:382"/>
Advice, to which I had myſelf formerly been beholden, and from whom I concealed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Next, To keep her out of Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Way: And laſtly, That I might have an Opportunity, from Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi>'s Opinion, to judge of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of her Repentance: For, <hi>Polly,</hi> ſaid I, you muſt imagine, ſo regular and uniform as all our Family is, and ſo good as I thought all the People about me were, that I could not ſuſpect, that ſhe, the Duties of whoſe Place made her neareſt to my Perſon, was the fartheſt from what I wiſhed.</p>
                  <p>I have ſet this Matter ſo ſtrongly before her, and Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> has ſo well ſeconded me, that I hope the beſt; for the Grief the poor Creature carries in her Looks, and expreſſes in her Words, cannot be deſcribed; frequently accuſing herſelf with Tears, ſaying often to Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> She is not worthy to ſtand in the Preſence of a Miſtreſs, whoſe Example ſhe has made ſo bad an Uſe of, and whoſe Leſſons ſhe had ſo ill followed.</p>
                  <p>I am ſadly troubled at this Matter however; but I take great Comfort in reflecting, that my ſudden Indiſpoſition look'd like a providential Thing, which may ſave one poor Soul, and be a ſeaſonable Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her, as long as ſhe lives.</p>
                  <p>Mean time I muſt obſerve, that at Supper laſt Night, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> look'd abject, and mean, and like a poor Thief, as I thought; and (conſcious of his diſappointed Folly, tho' I ſeldom glanc'd my Eye upon him) had leſs to ſay for himſelf than ever.</p>
                  <p>And once my Lady <hi>Davers</hi> laughing, ſaid, I think in my Heart, my Nephew looks more fooliſh every time I ſee him, than the laſt.</p>
                  <p>He ſtole a Look at me, and bluſh'd; and my Lord ſaid, <hi>Jackey</hi> has ſome Grace!—He bluſhes! —Hold up thy Head, Nephew! — Haſt thou no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to ſay for thyſelf?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:0272600703:383"/>Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, A Bluſh becomes a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman!—I never ſaw one before tho', in Mr. <hi>H.</hi>— What's the Matter, Sir?</p>
                  <p>Only, ſaid Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> his Skin or his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is mended, that's all.</p>
                  <p>Thank you, Madam, was all he ſaid, bowing to his Aunt, and affecting a careleſs, yet confuſed Air, as if he whiſper'd a Whiſtle.</p>
                  <p>Oh Wretch! thought I, ſee what it is to have a condemning Conſcience; while every <hi>innocent</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon looks round, unconſcious, ſmiling, and erect! —But yet it was not the Shame of a bad Action, I doubt, but being diſcovered and diſappointed, that gave him this Confuſion of Face.</p>
                  <p>What a ſad Thing it is for a Perſon to be guilty of ſuch Actions, as ſhall put it into the Power of another, even by a Look, to mortify him! And if poor Souls can be thus abjectly ſtruck at ſuch a Diſcovery as this, by a Fellow Creature, how muſt they appear before an unerring and omniſcient Judge, with a Conſcience ſtanding in the Place of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Witneſſes?—The Words <hi>Weeping</hi> and <hi>Wailing, Howling</hi> and <hi>Gnaſhing of Teeth,</hi> exceedingly well expreſs, what nothing but the Divine Book can equally expreſs; which in another Place, points them out as calling upon the <hi>Mountains to fall upon them,</hi> and the <hi>Hills to cover them!</hi> — How ſerious this Subject makes one!</p>

                  <p>I AM juſt retired from a kind of fatiguing Service; for who ſhould come hither to dine with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> but that ſad Rake Sir <hi>Charles Hargrave,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Walgrave,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Floyd,</hi> three as bad as himſelf; inſeparable Companions, whoſe whole

Delight, and that avowedly, is Drinking, and Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Lewdneſs; but otherwiſe, Gentlemen of Wit, and large Eſtates? Three of them broke in upon us, at the <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>See</hi> Vol. II. <hi>p.</hi> 178.</note> Hall, on the happieſt Day of my Life, to our great Regret; and they had been long threatening to make this Viſit, in order to ſee me, as they told Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They whipt out two Bottles of <hi>Champaign</hi> inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for a <hi>Whet,</hi> as they called it, and went to view the Stud, and the Kennel, and then took a Walk in the Garden till Dinner was ready; my Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> as well as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> (for they are all acquainted) accompanying them.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> it ſeems, as Lord <hi>Davers</hi> told me afterwards, ſaid, He long'd to ſee Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> She was the Talk where-ever he went, and he had conceiv'd an high Opinion of her before-hand.</p>
                  <p>Lord <hi>Davers</hi> ſaid, I defy you, Gentlemen, to think ſo highly of her as ſhe deſerves, take Mind and Perſon together.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Floyd</hi> ſaid, He never ſaw any Woman yet, that came up to what he expected, where Fame had been laviſh in her Praiſe.</p>
                  <p>But how, Brother Baronet, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles</hi> to Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> came <hi>you</hi> to be reconcil'd to her?—I heard that you would never own her.</p>
                  <p>Oons, Man, ſaid Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> I was taken in — I was, by my Soul! — They contrived to clap her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, as Lady <hi>Jenny C.</hi> and pretended they'd keep t'other out of my Sight; and I was plaguily bit, and forced to get off as well as I could.</p>
                  <p>That was a Bite indeed, ſaid Mr. <hi>Walgrave</hi>; and ſo you fell a praiſing Lady <hi>Jenny,</hi> I warrant, to the Skies!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:0272600703:385"/>Ye—as,— by my Soul, (drawling out the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Monoſyllable) I was uſed moſt ſcurvily; 'faith I was.—I bear 'em a Grudge for't ſtill, I can tell 'em that; — for I have hardly been able to hold up my Head like a Man ever ſince—but am forc'd to ſneak about, and go, and come, and do as they bid me. By my Troth, I never was ſo manageable in my Life.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> Neighbours, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> with an Oath, will rejoice to hear this; for the whole County there cannot manage you.</p>
                  <p>I'm quite cow'd now, by my Soul, as you will ſee by-and-by: Nay, for that Matter, if you can ſet Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> a talking, there's ne'er a Puppy of you all will care to open your Lips, except to ſay as ſhe ſays.</p>
                  <p>Never fear, old Boy, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> we'll bear our Parts in Converſation. I never ſaw the Woman yet, that could give me either Awe or Love for ſix Minutes together. What think <hi>you,</hi> Mr. <hi>B.?</hi> Have you any Notion, that your Lady will have ſo much Power over us?</p>
                  <p>I think, Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> I have one of the fineſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>England</hi>; but I neither expect nor deſire you Rakes ſhould ſee her with my Eyes.</p>
                  <p>You know, if I have a Mind to love her, and make Court to her too, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I will: And I am half in Love with her already, altho' I have not ſeen her.</p>
                  <p>They came in when Dinner was near ready, and the Four Gentlemen took each a large Bumper of Old Hock for another Whet.</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs, Lady <hi>Davers,</hi> and I, came down together. The Gentlemen knew our two noble Gueſts, and were known to them in Perſon, as well as by Character. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his uſual kind and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Manner, took my Hand, and preſented the Four Gentlemen to me, each by his Name. Sir <hi>Charles</hi> ſaid, pretty bluntly, That he hoped he was
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0272600703:386"/>
more welcome to me now, than the laſt time he was under the ſame Roof with me; for he had been told ſince, that <hi>that</hi> was our happy Day.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid, Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Friends were always welcome to me.</p>
                  <p>'Tis well, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Sedley,</hi> we did not know how it was. We ſhould have quarter'd our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon Mr. <hi>B.</hi> for a Week together, and kept him up Day and Night.</p>
                  <p>I thought this Speech deſerved no Anſwer, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as they were Gentlemen who wanted no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and addreſs'd myſelf to Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> who is always kindly making Court to me: I hope, my good Lord, ſaid I, you find yourſelf quite recover'd of your Head-ach? — (of which he complained at Breakfaſt).</p>
                  <p>I thank you, my dear Siſter, pretty well.</p>
                  <p>I was telling Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> and the other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Niece, ſaid Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> how I was cheated here, when I came firſt, with a Lady <hi>Jenny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was a very lucky Cheat for me, Sir <hi>Jacob</hi>; for it gave you a Prepoſſeſſion in my Favour, under ſo advantageous a Character, that I could never have expected otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh, ſaid the Counteſs, my Daughter, for whom Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> took you, had Mrs. <hi>B.</hi>'s Qualities to boaſt of.</p>
                  <p>How am I obliged to your Ladyſhip's Goodneſs, return'd I, when you treat me with even greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence than you uſe to ſo beloved a Daughter!</p>
                  <p>Nay, now you talk of treating, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> when, Ladies, will you treat our Sex with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs which you ſhew to one another?</p>
                  <p>When your Sex deſerve it, Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> ſaid Lady <hi>Davers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who is to be Judge of that? ſaid Mr. <hi>Walgrave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not the Gentlemen, I hope, reply'd my Lady.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:0272600703:387"/>Well then, Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> we beſpeak your good Opinion of <hi>us</hi>; for you have <hi>ours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am obliged to you, Gentlemen; but I muſt be more cautious in declaring <hi>mine,</hi> leſt it ſhould be thought I am influenc'd by your kind, and perhaps too haſty Opinions of me.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Charles</hi> ſwore they had <hi>ſeen</hi> enough of me the Moment I entered the Parlour, and <hi>heard</hi> enough the Moment I opened my Lips, to anſwer for <hi>their</hi> Opinions of me.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid, I made no doubt, when <hi>they</hi> had as good a Subject to expatiate upon, as I had, in the Pleaſure before me, of ſeeing ſo many agreeable Friends of Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s, they would maintain the Title they claim'd to every one's good Opinion.</p>
                  <p>This, ſaid Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> is binding you over, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to your good Behaviour. — You muſt know, my Niece never ſhoots flying, as <hi>you</hi> do.</p>
                  <p>The Gentlemen laugh'd: Is it ſhooting flying, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> return'd Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> to praiſe that Lady?</p>
                  <p>Adsbud, I did not think of that.</p>
                  <p>O Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaid the Counteſs, you need not be at a Fault; — for a good Sportſman always hits his Mark, flying or not: And the Gentlemen had ſo fair an one, that they could not well miſs it.</p>
                  <p>You are fairly help'd over the Stile, Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Floyd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed I wanted it; tho' I limp'd like a Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, before I was lame. One can't think of every thing, as one us'd to do at your Time of Life, Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>This flippant Stuff was all that paſs'd, which I <hi>can</hi> recite; for the reſt, at Table, and after Dinner, was too polite by half for me: Such as, The Quantity of Wine each Man could <hi>carry off,</hi> that was the Phraſe; Dogs, Horſes, Hunting, Racing, Cock-fighting, and all accompanied with Swearing, and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0272600703:388"/>
Curſing, and that in good Humour, and out of Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs (the leaſt excuſable and moſt profligate Sort of Swearing and Curſing of all); loud Laughing, with a little touching now-and-then on the Borders of Sir <hi>Simon</hi>'s beloved Subject, to try if they could make a Lady ſhew ſhe <hi>underſtood</hi> their Hints by her <hi>Bluſhes</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>See</hi> Vol. II. <hi>p.</hi> 111.</note>; a certain Indication, that thoſe who ſeek a Bluſh in others, are paſt it themſelves, and, by their turning it into Ridicule when they find it in their Friends, that they would not for the World have it imputed to them; talking three or four at once, and as loud as if they were in the Field purſuing their Game, at a Quarter of a Mile's Diſtance from one another.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the Subjects, and this the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that held my Ladies and me for one Hour after a tedious Dinner; when we retir'd, and glad we were to do ſo: And ſo well did the Gentlemen like the Wine, that we had the Felicity to drink Tea and Coffee by ourſelves; only Mr. <hi>B.</hi> (upon our inviting the Gentlemen to partake with us) ſliding in for a few Minutes, to tell us, they would ſtick by what they had, and taking a Diſh of Coffee with us.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould not omit one Obſervation; That Sir <hi>Jacob,</hi> when they were gone, ſaid, They were <hi>pure Company:</hi> And Mr. <hi>H.</hi> That he never was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in his <hi>born Days.</hi> — While the two Ladies put up their Prayers, that they might never have ſuch another Entertainment. And being encouraged by their Declaration, I preſumed to join in the ſame Petition.</p>
                  <p>Yet, it ſeems, theſe are Men of Wit! I believe they muſt be ſo — becauſe I could neither like nor underſtand them. — Yet, if their Converſation had much Wit in it, I ſhould think my Ladies would have found it out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="384" facs="tcp:0272600703:389"/>However, this they did find out, and agree in that theſe Gentlemen were of the true modern Caſt of Libertines and Foxhunters, and, indifferently as they liked them, could not be eaſily out-done by any of the ſame Stamp in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God defend my dear Miſs <hi>Darnford,</hi> and every worthy ſingle Lady, from ſuch an Husband, as a Gentleman of this Character would make!</p>
                  <p>I wonder really, how Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who chuſes not this ſort of Converſation, and always (whatever Faults he had beſides) was a <hi>ſober</hi> Gentleman, can ſit for Hours ſo eaſy and chearful in it; and yet he never ſays much, when they are in their high Delight.</p>
                  <p>When all's done, Miſs, there are very unpleaſant Things, which Perſons in <hi>genteel</hi> Life are forced to put up with, as well as thoſe in <hi>lower</hi>; and were the one to be balanced againſt the other, the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as to true Happineſs, would not perhaps be ſo great, as People in the latter imagine, — if it did not turn in their Favour. Well ſays the above quoted Manuſcript,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>We the Diſcomforts know of what we are,</l>
                     <l>But little think what States ſuperior ſhare.—</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Gentlemen, permit me to add, went away very merry to ride ten Miles by Owl-light; for they would not accept of Beds here. They had two <hi>French</hi> Horns with them, and gave us a Blaſt, or Flouriſh or two, at going off. Each had a Servant beſides: But the Way they were in, would have given me more Concern than it did, had they been related to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and leſs uſed to it. And indeed it is a Happineſs, that ſuch Gentlemen take no more Care, than they generally do, to intereſt any body, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, in their Healths and Preſervation; for theſe are all ſingle Men. Nor is the Publick, any more than the Private, under any Neceſſity to be much
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0272600703:390"/>
concern'd about them; for let ſuch Perſons go when they will, if they continue ſingle, their next Heir cannot well be a worſe Commonwealth's-man; and there is a great Chance he may be a better.</p>
                  <p>You know I end my <hi>Saturdays</hi> ſeriouſly. And this, to what I have already ſaid, makes me add, that I cannot expreſs how much I am, my dear Miſs,</p>

                  </note> Sir <hi>Simon</hi> has been ſo kind as to comply with my Wiſhes. Both your charming Letters came to my Hand together, and I thank you an hundred times for them; and I thank your dear Mamma, and Sir <hi>Simon</hi> too, for the Pleaſure they have given me in this obliging Permiſſion. How happy ſhall we be together! But how long will you be permitted to ſtay, tho'? — All the Winter, I hope: — And then, when that is over, let us ſet out together, if God ſhall ſpare us, directly for <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and ſo paſs moſt of the Summer too in each other's Company. What a ſweet Thought is this! — Let me indulge it a little while.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> read your Letters, and ſays, You are a charming young Lady, and ſurpaſs yourſelf in every

Letter. I told him, that he was more intereſted in the Pleaſure I took in this Favour of Sir <hi>Simon</hi>'s, than he imagin'd. As how, my Dear? ſaid he. A plain Caſe, Sir, reply'd I: For endeavouring to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove myſelf by Miſs <hi>Darnford</hi>'s Converſation and Behaviour, I ſhall every Day be more worthy of your Favour. He kindly would have it, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, no, not Miſs <hi>Darnford</hi> herſelf, excelled me.</p>
               <p>'Tis right, you know, Miſs, he ſhould think ſo— tho' I muſt know nothing at all, if I was not ſenſible how inferior I am to my dear Miſs <hi>Darnford:</hi> And yet, when I look abroad now-and-then, I could be a proud Slut, if I would, and not yield the Palm to many others. —But don't let every body know how vain I am: Yet they may too, if they take in, at the ſame time, that I have ſome Excuſe, when I have won ſo happily the Favour of two ſuch Judges, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Miſs <hi>Darnford,</hi> and had the good Fortune, too, to rejoice in that of Lady Davers, and the Counteſs of <hi>C.</hi>

My <hi>Polly</hi> was there, Morning and Evening, with her Heart broken almoſt, poor Girl!—I put her in a Corner of my Cloſet, becauſe her Concern ſhould not be minded. Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> gives me great Hopes of her:—And ſhe ſeems to abhor the Thought of Mr. <hi>H.</hi>—But as there proves to be ſo little of real Love in her Heart, tho' even, if there had, ſhe would have been without Excuſe—is ſhe not the wickeder by half for that, Miſs?

                  <p>Sir <hi>Jacob</hi> was much pleaſed with our Family Order, and ſaid, 'Twas no Wonder I <hi>kept</hi> ſo good myſelf, that was his Word, and made others ſo; and he was of Opinion, that the four Rakes (for he run on, how much they admir'd me) would be converted, if they ſaw how well I paſſed my Time, and how chearful and eaſy every one, as well as myſelf, was under it. He ſaid, when he came home, he thought he muſt take ſuch a Method himſelf in <hi>his</hi> Family; for, he believed, it would make not only better Maſters and Miſtreſſes, but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Children, and better Servants too. But, poor Gentleman! he has, I doubt, a great deal to mend in <hi>himſelf,</hi> before he can begin ſuch a Practice with Efficacy in his <hi>Family.</hi>

Mr. <hi>B.</hi> accompany'd him ſome Miles on his Journey, attended by Mr. <hi>Colbrand</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>; and the two Ladies, and Lord <hi>Davers,</hi> and I, took an Airing in the Coach.</p>

                  <head>WEDNESDAY.</head>
                  <p>COULD you ever have thought, Miſs, that Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands have a Diſpenſing Power over their Wives, which Kings are not allowed over the Laws? I have this Day had a ſmart Debate with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and I fear it will not be the only one upon this Subject. Can you believe, that if a Wife thinks
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0272600703:395"/>
a Thing her Duty to do, and her Husband does not approve of her doing it, he can diſpenſe with her performing it, and no Sin ſhall lie at her Door? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> maintains this Point. I have great Doubts about it; particularly one; that if a Matter be my Duty, and he diſpenſes with my Performance of it, whether, even altho' that were to clear <hi>me</hi> of the Sin, it will not fall upon <hi>himſelf?</hi> And to be ſure, Miſs, a good Wife would be as much concern'd at this, as if it was to remain upon <hi>her.</hi> Yet he ſeems ſet upon it. What can one do?—Did you ever hear of ſuch a Notion before, Miſs? Of ſuch a Prerogative in a Husband? Would you care to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to it? This is one of Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Particularities. He has ſeveral of them, the Effects, as I take it, of his former too free Life. Polygamy, as I have mentioned heretofore, is another. That is a bad one indeed. Yet he is not ſo determin'd on this, as he ſeems to be on the other, in a certain Caſe, that is too <hi>nice</hi> for me, at preſent, to explain to you; and ſo I might as well have taken no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, as yet—Only the Argument was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to my Mind: Held within this Hour, and I write a Journal, you know, of what paſſes. But I will, ſome time hence, ſubmit it, at leaſt to <hi>your</hi> Judgments, my Father and Mother. You are well read in the Scriptures, and have gone thro' the Occaſion often; and both Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and I found our Arguments on Scripture, tho' we are ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in our Opinions. He ſays, my Ladies are of his Opinion. I'm afraid they are, and ſo will not ask them. But perhaps, I mayn't live, and other, things may happen; and ſo I'll ſay no more of it at preſent <note n="*" place="bottom">For the Sequel of this Matter, ſee <hi>Vol. IV. p. 33.</hi>

                  <head>THURSDAY.</head>
                  <p>MY Lady urging me to procure her the Verſes you alſo deſire about the Love Quarrel, I this Day prevailed upon Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to favour me with a Sight of them; and he was ſo kind as to give us the following Hiſtory of the Parties and the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</p>
                  <p>A fine Gentleman, his Friend, bleſt with an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Fortune, and extraordinary Qualities, but not free from Faults as great as his Perfections, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally with regard to Ladies, was approved of by the Parents of a Lady beautiful as a <hi>May</hi> Morning, tender and meek as a Lamb,—and prudent and witty; but ſo diffident, that ſhe had hardly a Will of her own; which ſubjected her to Inconveniencies.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman made a Campaign, as a Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, having a Fondneſs for the Miliary Life, and no Inclination to marry; but being ſlightly wounded, and coming over to be cured, and the Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propoſed, their Fortunes very great on both Sides, he ſo well approved the Propoſal, and the Lady fell ſo much in Love with him, that it was in a manner concluded upon.</p>
                  <p>The Lady's Uncle Sir <hi>G. K.</hi> a Man of a very waſpiſh, poſitive, and ſordid Temper, to whoſe large Eſtate, as well as her Father's, the young Lady was Heireſs, oppoſes the Match; it is put off to pleaſe him. The Gentleman makes another Campaign. Her Father dies mean time, leaving Sir <hi>G.</hi> her Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian; but with expreſs Deſire to ſee her marry'd to that Gentleman, and no other. Sir <hi>G.</hi> endeavours to bring about another Match for the Lady, with a Man of Quality, notwithſtanding his Brother's Deſire; but the Lady, who had fixed her Affections on
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0272600703:397"/>
the Gentleman, rejects the Propoſal: And her Lover coming over at the End of the Campaign, the Lady conſents to perform her Father's Will; a Will ſo conformable to her own Inclinations; but would not fix the Day, till he had made up with her Uncle, and got his Conſent; which the old ſpiteful Knight was reſolved not to give, and, for a great while, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman not to ask, deſpiſing the Knight, and having a Spirit above ſuppling himſelf to an unworthy Mind for ſordid Intereſt ſake.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, however, ſhe prevails: Her Lover, with no good Will, reſolves to court Sir <hi>George,</hi> who, to have a Pretence to break the Matter off, treats him with great Indignity, ſetting his Servants to inſult him. This the young Gentleman reſenting, the Knight following him with Outrage to the Top of a Pair of Stairs, he twirled him from Top to Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom almoſt; and ſprain'd the Knight's Foot in the Fall, and went away with Indignation.</p>
                  <p>This being reported to the Lady, who lived not at that Time with Sir <hi>George,</hi> but at her paternal Seat, and being greatly aggravated to her, ſhe flies to her Uncle, reſolves to break with her Lover, and takes up her Reſidence with Sir <hi>George</hi> for a while; the old Knight keeping up her Reſentment, and prevailing on her to refuſe Acceſs to the Man to whom ſhe was betrothed, believing, poor Lady! that her Affections were more in her own Power than ſhe afterwards found them, to her Sorrow. For ſhe carry'd the Point ſo far, renouncing him, thro' freſh Aggravations invented againſt him, tho', indeed, he had formerly given himſelf too great Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, that he went abroad again, giving her quite for loſt, and enter'd into other Engagements, which made them both unhappy to the End of their Lives.</p>

For how does one know, but it may be as well written and as ſenſible a Letter as this Claſs of People generally write? — But what then ſhall we be able to ſay for ſuch poor Creatures of our Sex as are <hi>taken in,</hi> as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> calls it, by ſuch pretty Fellows as this; who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they may happen to write better, hardly think better, or deſign to act better, and are not ſo ſoon brought to Repentance, and Promiſes of Amendment?</p>

                  <p>I have a Time in View, when, poſſibly, my Papers may fall under the Inſpection of a dear Gentleman, to whom, next to God, I am accountable for all my Actions and Correſpondencies; ſo I will either write an Account of the Matter, and ſeal it up, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, for Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or, at a proper Opportunity, will break it to him, and let him know (under Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, if I can engage him to promiſe it) the Steps I took in it; for fear ſomething ſhould ariſe hereafter, when I cannot anſwer for myſelf, to render any thing dark or queſtionable in it. A Method I believe very proper to be taken by every marry'd Lady; and I preſume the rather to ſay ſo, having had a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for it: For I have often thought of a little

ſeal'd-up Parcel of Papers, my Lady made me burn in her Preſence about a Month before ſhe dy'd. — They are, <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid ſhe, ſuch as I have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be concern'd about, let who will ſee them, could they know the Springs and Cauſes of them: But, for Want of a Clue, my Son might be at a Loſs what to think of ſeveral of thoſe Letters, were he to find them, in looking over my other Papers, when I am no more.</p>
                  <p>Let me add, that nothing could be more endearing than our Parting with our noble Gueſts. My Lady repeated her Commands for what ſhe often engaged me to promiſe, that is to ſay, to renew the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence begun between us, ſo much (as ſhe was pleaſed to ſay) to her Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>I could not help ſhewing her Ladyſhip, who was always inquiring after my Writing Imployment, moſt of what paſs'd between you and me, Miſs; and ſhe admires you much, and wiſh'd Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had more Wit, that was her Word: She ſhould in that Caſe, ſhe ſaid, be very glad, to ſet on Foot a Treaty between you and him.</p>
                  <p>But that, I fanſy, can never be tolerable to you, and I only mention it <hi>en paſſant.</hi>—There's a <hi>French</hi> Woman for you!</p>
                  <p>The Counteſs was full of her kind Wiſhes for my Happineſs; and my Lady <hi>Davers</hi> told me, That if I could give them timely Notice, ſhe would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent on a <hi>certain</hi> Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>But, my dear Miſs, what could I ſay? — I know nothing of the Matter!—Only, that I am a ſad Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and have a thouſand Anxieties, which I cannot mention to any body.</p>
                  <p>But, if I have ſuch in the honourable Eſtate of Matrimony, what muſt thoſe poor Souls have, who have been ſeduced, and have all Manner of Reaſon to apprehend, that the Crime ſhall be followed by a

Puniſhment ſo <hi>natural</hi> to it? A Puniſhment <hi>in kind,</hi> as I may ſay; which if it only ends in Forfeiture of Life, following the Forfeiture of Fame, muſt be thought merciful and happy beyond Expectation; for how ſhall they lay Claim to the Hope that is given to Perſons in their Circumſtance, that <hi>they ſhall be ſaved in Child-bearing,</hi> ſince the Condition is, <hi>if they</hi> CONTINUE <hi>in Faith and Charity, and</hi> HOLINESS <hi>with</hi> SOBRIETY?</p>
                  <p>Now, my honoured Mother, and my dear Miſs, ſince I am upon this affecting Subject, does not this Text ſeem to give a comfortable Hope to a virtuous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who ſhall die in this Circumſtance, that ſhe ſhall be happy in the Divine Mercies? For the Apoſtle, in the Context, ſays, That he <hi>ſuffers not a Woman to teach, nor to uſurp Authority over the Man, but to be in Silence</hi> — And what is the Reaſon he gives? Why, a Reaſon that is a natural Conſequence of the Curſe on the firſt Diſobedience, that ſhe ſhall be in Subjection to her Husband. — For, ſays he, <hi>Adam was</hi> NOT <hi>deceived; but the Woman, being deceived, was in the Tranſgreſſion.</hi> As much as to ſay,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Had it not been for the Woman, <hi>Adam</hi> had kept his Integrity, and therefore her Puniſhment ſhall be, as it is ſaid, <hi>I will greatly multiply thy Sorrow in thy Conception: In Sorrow ſhalt thou bring forth Children, — and thy Husband ſhall rule over thee.</hi> But nevertheleſs, if thou ſhalt not ſurvive the Sharpneſs of thy Sorrow, thy Death ſhall be deemed to be ſuch an Alleviation of thy Part of the intailed Tranſgreſſion, that thou ſhalt <hi>be ſaved,</hi> if thou haſt CONTINUED in Faith, and Charity, and HOLINESS with SOBRIETY."</q>

But may-be I am the weakeſt and moſt apprehenſive of my Sex — May-be I am! — And when one ſees how common the Caſe is, and yet how few die in it; how uneaſy many Ladies are <hi>not</hi> to be in this Circumſtance, (my good Lady <hi>Davers</hi> particularly, at times) and <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> in Holy Writ; and then how a childleſs Eſtate might leſſen one in the Eſteem of one's Husband, one ought to bring theſe Conſiderations in Balance, and to baniſh needleſs Fears. And ſo I will, if I can.</p>
                  <p>But a Word or two more, as to the parting with our honoured Gueſts. I was a little indiſpos'd, and my Ladies would excuſe me, againſt my Will, from attending them in the Coach ſome Miles, which their dear Brother did. Both Ladies moſt tenderly ſaluted me, twice and thrice apiece, folding their kind Arms about me, and wiſhing my Safety and Health, and charging me to <hi>think</hi> little, and <hi>hope</hi> much; for they ſaw me thoughtful at times, tho' I endeavoured to hide it from them.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Davers</hi> was pleaſed to ſay, with a Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper that is his Peculiar, My deareſt, dear Siſter, — May God preſerve you! — and multiply your Comforts!

                  <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> looked conſcientiouſly ſilly.—I can ſay nothing, Madam — but (ſaluting me) that I ſhall never forget your Goodneſs to me.—Adding, in his frothy Way, Now can I ſay, I have ſaluted an Angel, if ever there was an Angel on Earth.</p>
                  <p>I had before, in Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi>'s Parlour, taken Leave of Mrs. <hi>Worden</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Leſley,</hi> my Lady's Women: They each, ſtole, as it were, at the ſame time, a Hand of mine, and kiſſed it, begging Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as they ſaid, for the Freedom. But I anſwer'd, taking each by her Hand, and kiſſing her, I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways think of you with Pleaſure, my good Friends, for you have encouraged me conſtantly by your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in my private Duties. And may God bleſs you, and the worthy Families you ſo laudably ſerve, as well for your ſakes, as their own!</p>
                  <p>They turned away with Tears, and Mrs. <hi>Worden</hi> would have ſaid ſomething to me, but could not.— Only both taking Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> by her Hand, Happy, happy, Mrs. <hi>Jervis!</hi> ſaid they, almoſt in a Breath. —And happy, happy I, too, repeated I, in my Mrs. <hi>Jervis,</hi> and in ſuch kind and worthy Well-wiſhers as Mrs. <hi>Worden</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Leſley.</hi> Wear this, Mrs. <hi>Worden</hi>; wear this, Mrs. <hi>Leſley,</hi> for my ſake; —And I gave each of them a Ring, with a Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal and Brilliants ſet about it, which my deareſt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had bought a Week before for this very Purpoſe; for he has a great Opinion of both the good Folks, and often praiſed their Prudence, and their quiet and reſpectful Behaviour to every body, ſo different from the Impertinence, that was his Word, of moſt Ladies Women, who are Favourites.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi> ſaid, I have enjoyed many happy Hours in your Converſation, Mrs. <hi>Worden</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Leſley:</hi> I ſhall miſs you very much.</p>

                     <pb n="413" facs="tcp:0272600703:418"/>I muſt endeavour, ſaid I, taking her Hand, to make it up to you, my good Friend, as well as I can. And of late we have not had ſo many Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities together as I ſhould have wiſhed, had I not been ſo agreeably engaged as you know.— So we muſt each try to comfort the other, when we have loſt, I ſuch noble, and you ſuch worthy Gueſts.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi>'s honeſt Heart, before touched by the Parting, ſhew'd itſelf at her Eyes—Wonder not, my good Friends, ſaid I, to the two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, wiping with my Handkerchief her venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cheeks, that I always endeavour thus to dry up all my good Mrs. <hi>Jervis</hi>'s Tears; and then I kiſſed her, thinking of you, my dear Mother; and I was forced to withdraw a little abruptly, leſt I ſhould be too much moved myſelf, becauſe I was going up to our noble Gueſts, who, had they inquired into the Occaſion, would perhaps have thought it derogatory (tho' I ſhould not) to my preſent Station, and too much retroſpecting to my former.</p>
                  <p>I could not, in Converſation between Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and myſelf, when I was gratefully expatiating upon the amiable Characters of our noble Gueſts, and of their Behaviour and Kindneſs to me, help obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I had little expected, from ſome <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>He is a very good-natur'd Man, reply'd Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I believe I might once or twice drop ſome diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful Words of him. But it was the Effect of Paſſion, at the Time, and with a View to two or three Points of his Conduct in publick Life; for which I took the Liberty to find fault with him, and received very unſatisfactory Excuſes. One of
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0272600703:419"/>
theſe, I remember particularly, was in a Conference between a Committee of each Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which he behaved in a way I could not wiſh from a Gentleman ſo nearly ally'd to me by Marriage; for all he could talk of, was the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their Houſe, when the Reaſon of the Thing was ſtrong with the other; and it fell to my Lot to anſwer what he ſaid; which I did with ſome Aſperity, which occaſioned a Coolneſs between us for ſome Time.</p>
                  <p>But no Man makes a better Figure in private Life than Lord <hi>Davers;</hi> eſpecially now, that my Siſter's good Senſe has got the better of her Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſhe can behave with tolerable Decency towards him. For, formerly, <hi>Pamela,</hi> it was not ſo; the Violence of her Spirit making him appear in a Light too little advantageous either to his Quality or Merit. But now his Lordſhip improves upon me every time I ſee him.</p>
                  <p>You know not, my Dear, continued Mr. <hi>B.</hi> what a Diſgrace a haughty and paſſionate Woman brings upon her Husband, and upon herſelf too, in the Eye of her own Sex, as well as ours. Nay, even thoſe Ladies, who would be as glad of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion as ſhe, if they might be permitted to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it, deſpiſe others who do, and the Man <hi>moſt,</hi> who ſuffers it.</p>
                  <p>And let me tell you, my <hi>Pamela,</hi> ſaid the dear Gentleman, with an Air that ſhew'd he was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with his own Conduct in this Particular, that you cannot imagine how much a Lady owes to her Husband, as well with regard to <hi>her own</hi> Peace of Mind, as to <hi>both</hi> their Reputations, (however it may go againſt the Grain with her ſometimes) if he be a Man, who has Diſcretion to keep her incroaching Paſſions under a genteel and reaſonable Controul!</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>But after all, when one duly weighs the Matter, I can't tell but what he ſays may be right in the main; for I have not been able to contradict him, partial as I am to my Sex, when he has pointed out to me Inſtances in the Behaviour of certain Ladies, who, like Children, the more they have been hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd, the more humourſome they have grown; which muſt have occaſion'd as great Uneaſineſs to themſelves, as to their Husbands.

               <p>I Hear that Mrs. <hi>Jewkes</hi> is in no good State of Health. I am very ſorry for it. I pray for her Life, that ſhe may be a Credit (if it pleaſe God) to the Penitence ſhe has ſo lately aſſumed.— For if ſhe die, it will look diſcouraging to ſome thoughtleſs Minds, who penetrate not the Methods Providence takes with its poor Creatures, that as ſoon as ſhe had changed her Manner of Living, and was in a reformed State, ſhe was taken away: Tho' 'tis certain, that a Perſon is fitteſt to die, when worthieſt to live. And what a Mercy will it be to her, if ſhe ſhould <hi>not</hi> live long, that ſhe ſaw her Errors, and repented before 'twas too late?</p>
               <p>Do, my dear <hi>good Miſs,</hi> vouchſafe to the poor Soul the Honour of a Viſit: She may be low-ſpirited—She may be too much ſunk with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of paſt Things—Comfort, with that Sweetneſs which is ſo natural to Miſs <hi>Darnford,</hi> her drooping Heart, and let her know, that I have a true Concern for her, and give it her in Charge

               <p>You'll pardon me, my dear Miſs, that I put you upon ſuch an Office; an Office indeed unſuitable from a Lady in your Station, to one in hers; but not to your Piety and Charity, where a Duty ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent as that of viſiting the Sick, and chearing the doubting Mind, is in the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>I know your Condeſcenſion will give her great Comfort, and if ſhe ſhould be haſtening to her Account, what a Pleaſure will it give ſuch a Lady as you, to have illuminated a benighted Mind, when it was tottering on the Verge of Life!</p>
               <p>But I hope ſhe will get the better of her Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and live many Years a thankful Monument of God's Mercies, and to do more Good by her Example in the latter Part of her Life, than ſhe may poſſibly have done Evil in the former.</p>
               <p>I know ſhe will want no ſpiritual Help from good Mr. <hi>Peters</hi>; but then the kind Notice of ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eſteem'd a young Lady, will raiſe her more than can be imagined; for there is a Tenderneſs, a Sympathy, in the good Perſons of our Sex to one another, that (while the beſt of the other ſeem but to act as in Office, ſaying to one thoſe Things, which, tho' edifying and convincing, one is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proceeds not rather from the Fortitude of their Minds, than the Tenderneſs of their Natures) min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles from Sex to Sex with one's very Spirits, thins the animal Maſs, and runs thro' one's Heart, in the ſame lify Current (I can't cloathe my Thought ſuitably to expreſs what I <hi>would</hi> expreſs) giving Aſſurance as well as Pleaſure in the moſt arduous Caſes, and brightening our miſty Proſpects, till we ſee the Sun of Righteouſneſs riſing on the Hills of Comfort, and diſpelling the heavy Fogs of Doubt and Diffidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

When ſhall I? — To ſpeak to <hi>Circumſtance,</hi> it is <hi>all</hi> I <hi>long for</hi>; and, pardon my Freedom of Expreſſion, as well as Thought, when I let you know in this Inſtance, how <hi>early</hi> I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the <hi>ardent Longings</hi> of one in the Way I am in.</p>
               <p>But I ought not to ſet my Heart upon any thing that is not in my own Power, and which may be ſubject to Accidents, and the Controul of others. But, let whatever Interventions happen, ſo I have your <hi>Will</hi> to come, I muſt be rejoiced in your kind Intention, altho' your <hi>Power</hi> ſhould not prove anſwerable.</p>
               <p>And now, my deareſt honoured Mother, let me tell you, that I build no ſmall Conſolation in the Hope, that I ſhall, on a certain Occaſion, have your Preſence, and be ſtrengthened by your Advice and Comfortings. For this was a Propoſal of the beſt and moſt conſiderate of Gentlemen, who is every Day, if he but ſees the leaſt Thoughtfulneſs upon my Brow, ſtudying to ſay or to do ſomething to diſpel it. But I believe it is the grateful Senſe I have of his Goodneſs to me, that makes me thus over-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious: For the Apprehenſions of a Separation from ſuch an excellent Husband, from Hopes ſo chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Proſpects ſo delightful, muſt at times affect one, let one's Affiance and Deſires be ever ſo ſtrong where they ought to be preferably placed.—Then one <hi>would</hi> live to do a little more Good, if one <hi>might!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am a ſad weak, apprehenſive Body; to be ſure I am! How much better fitted for the Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Life, are the gay, frolick Minds, that think not of any thing before it comes upon them, than ſuch thoughtful Futurity-Pokers as me!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:0272600703:424"/>But why ſhould I trouble you, my honoured and dear Friends, with my idle Fears and Follies—juſt as if nobody was ever in my Circumſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? —Yet weak and apprehenſive Spirits will be gloomily-affected ſometimes; and how can one help it?—And if I may not hope for the indulgent Soothings of the beſt of Parents, and of my Miſs <hi>Darnford,</hi> in whoſe Boſom beſides can one disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den one's Heart, when oppreſſed by too great a Weight of Thought?</p>
               <p>You <hi>will</hi> come, and be in the Houſe with me, my dear Mother, for ſome Time, when my beſt Friend ſends to you:—Won't you?—And you will <hi>ſpare</hi> my dear Mother, my beſt of Fathers: Won't you? —Yes, yes, I am ſure ye will —And I am ſure my Miſs <hi>Darnford</hi> will be with me, if ſhe can; and theſe are my Comforts. But how I run on!—For I am ſo much a Novice, that—</p>
               <p>But I will ſay no more, than that I am, my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Father and Mother, your ever-dutiful Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and, my dear Miſs <hi>Darnford,</hi>
