            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT may be proper to take notice, that the Title given this Piece, at preſent, is copied from the French of <hi>Monſieur Favart;</hi> whoſe <hi>Caprices D' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ou Ninette a la Cour,</hi> the Author, Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> confeſſes was the ground-work of his Piece, called the <hi>Capricious Lovers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to make that Piece entertaining, (and in conformity with the <hi>Italian Burletta</hi>) Muſical Dialogues have been added towards the end of each Act; theſe are known among the Italians by the word <hi>Finale,</hi> and are deemed indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in an entertainment of this ſort. It is now preſented to the Public with many alterations. Several Airs have been added, others again ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and adapted to the talents of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent performers, ſome of them being Foreigners.</p>
            <p>As it was neceſſary to alter the Title of this Opera, to that of <hi>Phillis at Court,</hi> on account of the alterations made in it, and to prevent one copy being taken for the other, 'tis hoped it will meet with the approbation of the Publick.</p>

                     <p>Aye, there it is, your ladyſhip has no Italian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which is the life and ſoul of all muſick, the very eſſence of harmony. Your ſingers of taſte will run up and down the ladder of ſounds from the cellar up to the garret, now rumbling along till they make your ears crack again, and then in the piano they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire like a ſwan to their own melody. In our favourite compoſition we are not contented with making the ſound an echo to the ſenſe, but by a happy tumbling of both together, create the moſt agreeable confuſion of harmony in the univerſe.</p>

                     <p>It is the ſeat of wonders: every thing changes character here; the men are quite different; I met one who is the lord of the manor in our neighbourhood, a very proud gentleman amongſt us, he carries his head ſo high and ſo fierce, and threatens folks with his cane in the country if they do but look upon him; here he was bowing and ſcraping and cringing like a ſpaniel. Why are they ſo complaiſant here, theſe great folks who terrify and domineer over us in the country? Does the court make them ſo much better? No, I believe, if they do any good here, 'tis only to get a right to do ſomething bad elſewhere.</p>
