            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>INTRODUCTORY LETTER TO <hi>MR. FLAXMAN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>RECEIVE, my dear friend, with your uſual kindneſs, the long-ſuſpended Work, of which I had the pleaſure of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating to you a few verſes (as a joyous ſalute) on your ſafe arrival from Rome in the year 1794. I then hoped to render it a more early and a more chearful tribute to your improved talents, and to our long friendſhip. My production is not ſuch as I intended; yet I truſt, in its preſent ſtate, it is not utterly unworthy of your accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or of that favour which every warm heart muſt be inclined to hope its endeavours to celebrate the genius of a friend may receive from the public.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0394000300:5"/>You know but too well what impediments of anxiety and affliction have thwarted, for years, the progreſs of a performance that the honeſt pride of friendſhip would have zealouſly laboured to make more worthy of the artiſt to whom it is inſcribed. I am yet willing to think that affliction (ſo often uſeful in life) may have had ſome ſort of beneficial influence on this compoſition:
<q>Sunt lacrymae rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As much as my Work has loſt, in knowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, by the ſevere trouble, that interrupted and changed its courſe, it may have gained, perhaps, in nature and pathos. I could hardly convert the ſufferings of your dear diſciple to a uſe more noble, than that of making them inſtrumental, in any degree, to the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch an inſtructor.</p>
            <p>When I began the Poem, I intended that it ſhould comprize a ſketch of modern as well as ancient art: but
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0394000300:6"/>
my attention has been turned from Donatello, Ghiberti, and their ſucceſſors, to the dearer juvenile artiſt who, after the faireſt promiſe of future excellence, under your tender and animating care, has been deſtined to loſe the uncommon advantages he poſſeſſed, and valued, by a length of ſickneſs and complicated ſufferings.</p>
            <p>I have now watched, you know, conſiderably more than two years over this intereſting invalide: I have ſeen him enduring a horrible ſeries and variety of increaſing tortures; yet in this very long trial of a martyr's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and courage I have never heard a ſingle murmur eſcape from his lips; but have beheld him triumph over the ſevereſt unmerited corporeal torments by the ſerenity, fortitude, and ſweetneſs of a ſpirit truly angelic. In a part of this long and diſtreſſing period I have reſumed, at his affectionate requeſt, my ſuſpended Work, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in it, by ſuch troubled induſtry, as thoſe only can perfectly conceive, who have forced the mind to labour
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0394000300:7"/>
with motives of ſimilar affection, and with ſimilar diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude.</p>
            <p>Under ſuch circumſtances, you will not blame me for allowing my juſt admiration of your affectionate and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous, though diſabled diſciple, to alter the intended current of my verſe. Writing, as I have ever done, from the heart, I have followed its imperious ſuggeſtions; and your ſympathy, my dear friend, which I am confident I ſhall obtain, in this part of my ſubject, will form, at once, my juſtification and my reward.</p>
            <p>For your credit I ought, perhaps, to apprize my reader, that whatever defects he may diſcover in my Book, they are to be aſcribed ſolely to myſelf. As my ſequeſtered life has not allowed me to derive from ſeveral diſtant friends (of intelligence far ſuperior to mine on the ſubject which I preſume to treat) that light which might otherwiſe have embelliſhed my compoſition, I ought not to expoſe them to a ſuſpicion of having ſuggeſted, or countenanced any
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0394000300:8"/>
erroneous ideas, that a production of retired, yet often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſtudy, may happen to contain.</p>
            <p>To guard myſelf alſo from a charge of preſumption, it may be proper to declare that, in venturing to write upon Sculpture, I pretend not to inſtruct the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed artiſt, or the real connoiſſeur; (two claſſes of men whom I ought rather to conſult for information, and from whom I muſt ever have much to learn!) but I had perſuaded myſelf, that, by an extenſive Poem on this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried ſubject, I might be ſo fortunate as to promote the celebrity of a friend, in whoſe talents I delight; and afford ſome kind of aſſiſtance to all the admirers of Sculpture, in their various endeavours to naturalize a deſerving Art, which may ſtill be conſidered as little more than an alien in our country, if we compare the portion of public notice and favour, which it has hitherto obtained among us, to the honour and influence it enjoyed in the ancient world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0394000300:9"/>To encourage a general delight in the ingenious Arts, and to extend the reputation of their ſucceſsful profeſſors, has ever appeared to me one of the moſt deſirable purpoſes that Poetry can purſue; and particularly when that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is happily blended with the intereſt and the honour of friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Should the wiſhes of thoſe whom I regard induce me, in a ſeaſon of more tranquillity and leiſure, to delineate the riſe and progreſs of modern Art, in another Poem, for which I have abundant materials, I ſhall probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce that new ſubject by a ſketch of the injuries that Sculpture ſuſtained from the ſect of Iconoclaſts, or Image-breakers, and the animation it might acquire from the diſcovery of Herculaneum, and a more ſpirited reſearch in the ſubterranean cities.</p>
            <p>I intimate theſe topics, to obviate any ſurpriſe that my reader might feel on not finding them mentioned in the preſent Work. They appeared to me as more ſuited to
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0394000300:10"/>
form the line of connexion between the two diſtinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of ancient and modern Sculpture.</p>
            <p>But whatever fortune may attend me as the admirer and the eulogiſt of your noble art, that you, my excellent friend, may long cultivate and improve it, and that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal applauſe and increaſing felicity may be juſtly and graciouſly beſtowed by earth and Heaven on your labours and your life, is the cordial wiſh of</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Your very ſincere and fervent, Though deeply-afflicted friend, W. H.</signed>

                  <p>This miraculous coloſſal figure is commonly called the Statue of Memnon, and ſuppoſed to repreſent an Aethiopian prince of that name, the ſon of Tithonus and Aurora: but Pauſanias, from whom we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive one of the early accounts of it, expreſsly ſays, the inhabitants of the city where it was placed (the Thebans of Aegypt) aſſerted that it was

                  <p>A reſpectable traveller of our own country, the learned, faithful, and elaborate Pococke, has laboured to gratify curioſity concerning this
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0394000300:177"/>
this celebrated image, by a very minute deſcription, illuſtrated by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravings: yet with every advantage that erudition and a ſurvey of the fragment could afford him, he is obliged to leave the ſubject ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in conſiderable darkneſs; for among the various ſtatues that he examined in this intereſting ſcene, (the ruins of Thebes,) he found that two of them had pretenſions to be regarded as the miraculous image<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Mr. de Caylus has diſtinguiſhed the ſtatue of remote antiquity from that of a later time in the following remark on Aegyptian antiquities:</p>
                        <q>Il ne faut pas confondre la ſtatue de Memnon, dont parle Pline, avec celle qui ſubſiſte, et qui a inſpiré une ſi grande curioſité aux voyageurs anciens et modernes; non ſeulement cette dernière eſt coloſſale, mais elle eſt de granite. D'ailleurs elle étoit antique à l'egard de Pline, puiſqu' elle étoit placée de ſon tems dans l'endroit qu'elle occupe aujourdhui, c'eſt-à- dire, hors de la ville de Thèbes, aſſez près des tombeaux des anciens rois d' Aegypte, et qu'elle avoit été élevée avant la conquête, que les Perſes firent de ce pays; tandis que la ſtatue de <hi>baſalte</hi> que Pline preſente comme un objet beaucoup moins conſidérable, étoit conſacrée dans un temple de Sérapis, dont le culte n'a été introduit en Aegypte que ſous les Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lémées. <bibl>Antiquités de M. de CAYLUS, tom. v. p. 13.</bibl>
                        </q>
                     </note>; and of theſe he has given the following circumſtantial account:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>In the ſecond court (of the temple) are remains of two ſtatues of black granite. That to the weſt, which is ſitting, meaſured, from the hand to the elbow, five feet; thence to the ſhoulder four. The head is three feet and a half long, and the ear is one foot in length. The ſtatue to the eaſt is three feet five inches long in the foot. At a diſtance from it is the head with the cap. It is three feet ſix inches long, and behind it is the ornament of the dome-leaf. Some perſons have thought that one of theſe is the ſtatue of Memnon. From the temple I went to the ſtatues, which I ſhall call the coloſſal ſtatues of Memnon. They are towards Medinet-Habou. I ſpent above half a day at theſe ſtatues. They are of a very particular ſort of porous, hard granite, ſuch as I never ſaw before. It moſt reſembles the eagle-ſtone.</p>
                     <p>The ſtatues look to the ſouth-ſouth-eaſt, and are on a pedeſtal or plinth, entirely plain. That to the north is thirty feet long and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0394000300:178"/>
ſeventeen broad. The pedeſtal of the other is thirty-three feet long and nineteen wide, and they are about thirty feet apart. That to the ſouth is of one ſtone. The ſtatue to the north has been broken off at the middle, above the arms, that lie on the hams, and it has been built up with five tiers of ſtones—one to the top of the clinch of the elbow, another almoſt half way up the arm, one to the arm-pits, the fourth to the neck, and the fifth, the head and neck of one ſtone. The other tiers have two ſtones in front, except that the middle tier has three; and there are two ſtones in the thickneſs of the ſtatue. The feet are broken a quarter off from the toes: but as I did not take a particular draught of the parts of the ſtatue that are maimed, I thought it better to give it entire from the drawing and obſervations I did make. I found the height, from the bottom of the foot to the top of the knee, to be about nineteen feet; from the bottom of the foot to the ankle, two feet ſix inches; to the top of the inſtep, four feet; the foot is five feet broad, and the leg is four feet deep. The ornament behind the head ſeemed to be the dome-leaf, as I have it on a ſtatue of Harpocrates. At the ſide of the legs are two reliefs, and one between the legs, of the natural height, but much defaced. Between the former and the great ſtatue are hieroglyphics. The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal of the imperfect ſtatue is cracked acroſs, at the diſtance of about ten feet from the back part. There are alſo ſome flaws and cracks in the other ſtatue; but it is of one ſtone, which I dare poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively affirm, and in which I could not be miſtaken, having been twice at the ſtatues. I ſpent half a day there, and took down in my notes an account of every ſtone of which the upper part of the other is built. On the pedeſtal of the imperfect ſtatue is a Greek epigram; and on the inſteps and legs, for about eight feet high, are ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions in Greek and Latin; ſome being epigrams in honour of Memnon; others, the greater part, teſtimonies of thoſe who heard
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0394000300:179"/>
the ſound; and ſome alſo in unknown characters. All the inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ill cut, and in bad language, both on account of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſtone, and the ignorance of the people, who probably made money by cutting theſe inſcriptions for thoſe that came to hear the ſound. I copied them with all the exactneſs I could; though many of them were very difficult to be underſtood, and I was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely undiſturbed while I was doing it.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Thus far I have tranſcribed the induſtrious and accurate Pococke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his menſuration affords a ſatisfactory idea of Aegyptian ſculpture. I omit his diſcuſſion of the arguments concerning the point, which of the two ſtatues he has mentioned is the real Memnon, becauſe ſome ideas ſuggeſted by a later and more lively traveller of France have led me to believe that the report of Pauſanias was perfectly true, and that the marvellous ſtatue was never intended to repreſent the prince of Aethiopia. How it acquired the name of Memnon we ſhall gradually diſcover.</p>
                  <p>M. Savary, in his elegant, amuſing Letters on Aegypt, has compared ſuch reliques of Thebes as he could inveſtigate himſelf, with the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this magnificent ſcenery that are to be found in ancient authors, particularly Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, by whoſe aſſiſtance he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to throw new light on this miraculous image. He falls, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, into an evident miſtake, in ſaying that Strabo calls it the Statue of Memnon. That illuſtrious and accurate geographer only ſays, after naming a place, which he calls <gap reason="foreign">

                     </q> The latter, in his interpretation of this ſuperb inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeems to reduce it to a level with the pleaſant, myſterious epitaph in Gil Bias: "A qui eſta encerrada el alma del licenciado Pedro Garcias;" and to ſuppoſe that it was deſigned to lead ſome ingenious interpreter to the happy diſcovery of a latent treaſure. Though I preſume to rally the accompliſhed traveller of France for his ſubtle conſtruction, I am ſtill particularly inclined to credit the conjecture of M. Savary concerning the proper title of this celebrated coloſſal figure, becauſe it tends to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm another conjecture by which I would account for the manner in which it acquired the very different name of Memnon. Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus, in deſcribing the tomb of Oſymanduas, and the coloſſal ſtatues with which it was adorned, declares that theſe ſtatues were the work of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0394000300:181"/>
Memnon Sycnites. This ſculptor muſt have been an artiſt of the higheſt celebrity in his time; hence perhaps his moſt remarkable ſtatue aſſumed the name of its maker, in preference to that of the monarch whom it was deſigned to repreſent; and hence, as the name of this marvellous ſculptor happened to be alſo the name by which an heroic prince of Aethiopia was diſtinguiſhed, who is ſuppoſed to have founded the city of Abydus in Aegypt, many fabulous ſtories ſeem to have been invented to account for what in all probability never exiſted; I mean, a ſculptural repreſentation of the Aethiopian hero (the ally of Priam, and the unſucceſsful antagoniſt of Achilles) among the coloſſal ſtatues of Thebes.</p>
                  <p>Having expatiated ſo far on the name of this intereſting image, I will add but a few remarks on its miraculous ſound. Strabo and Savary ſeem to have agreed in the idea, that the wonder was rather to be ſlighted as the myſterious device of prieſtcraft, than to be regarded as a genuine miracle of Nature. Yet the eminent philoſophical poet of Derbyſhire, who has introduced this faſcinating ſtatue into his delightful Botanic Garden, appears, in a note to that poem, to think that philoſophy might very honeſtly contrive to produce a ſimilar effect.</p>
                  <p>It may be well worth the attention, both of artiſts and philoſophers, to conſider how far it may be poſſible and proper to engage the ſenſe of hearing as an aſſiſtant to enhance the pleaſure of ſight, when that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ariſes from any grand work of Art. Antiquity has proved that the picture of a battle may be exhibited to advantage with an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniment of martial muſic; and perhaps in a great naval monument, it would be eaſy to introduce, and conceal ſuch works of muſical me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm as might occaſionally increaſe, in a moſt powerful degree, the delight ariſing from ſuch a ſpectacle.</p>
                  <p>I cannot quit the ſtatue of Memnon without mentioning the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious of his ancient viſitors. Theſe were the emperor Hadrian with
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0394000300:182"/>
his empreſs Sabina, and a prince perhaps not leſs accompliſhed, and certainly more amiable than Hadrian, that deſerving idol of the Roman people, Germanicus! The hiſtorian Tacitus, who has recorded the viſit of the latter to this attractive ſtatue, ſays not a ſyllable expreſſive of his own opinion concerning the miraculous ſound<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <q>Ceterum Germanicus aliis quoque miraculis intendit animum; quorum praecipua fuere Memnonis ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I confeſs myſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to imagine that the marvel originated in the avaricious ingenuity of thoſe who were engaged in ſhewing this celebrated ſpectacle: but a different opinion was entertained by a modern writer on ſtatues, whoſe authority is ſo reſpectable, that I ſhall ſubmit to the reader his more candid ideas on this intereſting image. The Abbé Comte de Guaſco, whoſe learned and elegant hiſtorical eſſay, "De l'Uſage des Statues," I ſhall have very frequent occaſion to cite and to applaud, ſpeaks of this figure in his chapter on the prodigies and miracles attributed to ſtatues. He deſcribes it as a ſtatue raiſed to Memnon by Amenophis the Second, on the banks of the Nile; and after noticing the incredulity of Strabo, he ſays in a note, which I ſhall tranſcribe, that modern travellers had aſſured him they had been witneſſes of the phenomenon, which, in his opinion, may be fairly and naturally explained by atmoſpherical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <q>Des voyageurs modernes m'ont aſſuré avoir été temoins de ce phénomene. Il n'eſt pas étonnant que dans des ſiècles où la croyance en la divinité du ſoleil étoit dominante, il fût regardé comme ſurnaturel, et que ce bruit fût trouvé harmonieux. Mais dans un tems où la phyſique eſt mieux connue, il s'expliquera naturellement. La raréfaction de l'atmoſphere et la dilatation des ſolides cauſée par la chaleur des rayons du ſoleil, peuvent fournir d'autres examples de cette nature, et ils ne ſeront point embellis par la prevention que fait naitre la ſuperſtition.</q> De l'Uſage des Statues, p. 174.</note>.</p>

Some readers, indeed, are ſo faſtidious as to think that infirmity and affliction ſhould on no occaſion obtrude their private grievances (paſt or preſent) on the eye of the public: but every writer who records, with the eloquence of real ſenſibility, calamities that he has encountered with any degree of ſucceſs, is certainly a friend to ſuffering humanity; as his record may furniſh preſent or future fellow-ſufferers with a freſh incentive to fortitude or exertion; and the general ſympathy of Nature will probably make him ample amends for any accidental cenſure that he may happen to incur from unfeeling individuals.</p>

                  <p>An ingenious foreigner, who has added extenſive learning to a lively imagination, and who publiſhed, in our country, a work of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able magnitude on the origin and progreſs of the Arts, indulges a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that the head of the Urus, or ſavage bull, was the earlieſt work of ſculpture. This idea ſtruck him ſo forcibly, that he has endeavoured to diſplay and confirm a conjecture, not very probable, in the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſages of his elaborate and amuſing reſearches:</p>
                  <q>Ces obſervations nous decouvrent la marche de la ſculpture, et celle de la théologie des anciens. Cette théologie admettant d'abord un Etre Suprême, qu'elle regarda comme la pere inviſible de toutes choſes, le repréſenta par l'emblême du boeuf ſauvage. Le terme Tho, ou Théo, exprimant cet animal produiſit le mot Théos, d'où vint celui
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0394000300:189"/>
de Deus, qui ſignifia Dieu; parceque ſon emblême fût primitivement repréſenté ſous la forme de l'individu dont ce mot étoit le nom. La ſculpture en imitant la figure de cet animal, rendit l'idée de la thé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie. Cette idée préſcrivit l'objet qui fit peut-être decouvrir cet art ingenieux, ou du moins qui encouragea ces premiers eſſais.—<bibl>

                  <q>Ces médailles, frappées dans l'orient par un peuple Scythe, nous repréſentent la figure du boeuf à tête humaine, telle qu'on l'avoit dans un pais très voiſin de celui dont elle vint, et chez les deſcendans d'un peuple qui le premier employa cette emblême. Il paſſa delà dans la Grece, dans la Sicile, et dans l'Italie, ou on le voit ſi frequemment repréſenté ſur les médailles de Gela, d'Agrigente, de Naples, et de tant d'autres villes, repandues dans toutes les parties de la Grece. S'il eſt vrai, comme je le crois, que cette figure fût le principe de celles des autres dieux, repréſentés ſous la forme humaine, elle doit être regardée comme le germe et le premier pasde la ſculpture.—<bibl>P. 177.</bibl>

                  <p>From the energy of thoſe inventive paſſions, love and grief, we might be induced to ſuppoſe that the earlieſt efforts of rude ſculpture would be ſuch as they ſuggeſted for the purpoſe of obtaining a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, however imperfect, of ſome mortal infinitely beloved or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted: but hiſtory proves that ſuperſtitious fear is a paſſion ſtill more creative; and in Greece, which may be conſidered as the home, though not the native climate of Sculpture, it is evident that endeavours to repreſent different divinities by the rudeſt ſymbols preceded every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to expreſs human features by any kind of model. Stocks and ſtones were confeſſedly worſhipped as celeſtial powers, in that land of ingenuity, before any thing like a ſtatue, buſt, or medallion appeared. The trunk of an old tree was ſolemnly preſerved by the Theſpians, and idolized as their Juno<note n="*" place="bottom">Clemens Alexandrinus, who gives a ſimilar account of ſeveral ancient idols, informs us that theſe rude ſymbols were gradually exchanged for ſtatues of the human form, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the appellation <gap reason="foreign">

                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0394000300:192"/>At Orchomenos, the favourite ſeat of the Graces, ſo happily cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by Pindar, thoſe intereſting divinities were originally repreſented by three white ſtones. When a rude ſymbol was exchanged, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, for a more refined image, the Greeks were ſolicitous to preſerve ſome idea of the original type; a practice well illuſtrated by D'Hancarville, in his remark on theſe memorable ſymbols that firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Graces. He imagines that the union of the ſymbols gave riſe to the attitude which theſe patroneſſes of Grecian art aſſumed in their ſubſequent form:</p>
                  <q>L'union des trois pierres blanches, qui indiquoient les Graces à Orchomene, fut conſervée lorſque la ſculpture convertit ces pierres en ſtatues, le point par où elles ſe touchoient devint la main par laquelle chacune d'elles ſe repoſa ſur les bras de l'autre, tandis que de celle qu'elles avoient libre, elles tinrent les attributs qui les diſtinguoient. Cette attitude charmante continua d'indiquer l'avantage qu'elles ſe pretent l'une à l'autre, l'harmonie qui les rend inſeparables, et le plaiſir qu'elles procurent par leur union. Telles on les voit ſur les médailles, ſur beaucoup de pierres gravées, dans un petit groupe qui appartient à la maiſon de Borghèſe, mais particulierement dans les an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquites d'Herculaneum.

In contemplating the great contraſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch objects of popular veneration and the works of Phidias and Praxiteles, the mind takes a generous delight in the progreſſive powers of human ingenuity. The pleaſure we naturally feel in ſuch a contraſt has induced many writers to inveſtigate, with great labour, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure origin of different arts. M.

prefixed to his Etruſcan Antiquities, has endeavoured to trace the riſe and early progreſs of ſculpture through many centuries of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs prior to the age of Daedalus; a period with which the active en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm of Winkelman had ſeemed to ſatisfy itſelf, in his elaborate and animated Hiſtory of Ancient Art.</p>
                  <p>If the conjectures of a writer may be truſted, who ventures to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neate a period ſo very diſtant and dark, the origin of Grecian ſculpture may be aſſigned to the reign of Apis, the ſucceſſor of Phoroneus, about 1778 years before the Chriſtian aera<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </note>; and according to a very reaſonable ſuppoſition of M. D'Hancarville, this delightful and difficult art was more than a thouſand years in proceeding, by inſenſible degrees, from a ſtate of rude barbarity to its period of exquiſite perfection. Of its moſt remarkable ſteps, and of many memorable artiſts who particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly contributed to its advancement, I ſhall ſpeak in ſubſequent notes. I return to the immediate ſubject of this,—the diſpoſition to fond idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in an afflicted parent. Two ſtriking, though very different charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ancient world are remarkable examples of this diſpoſition— Nimrod and Cicero. The ſtrong feelings of nature, on the loſs of a beloved child, produced the ſame wildneſs of affectionate fancy in the imperial hunter and in the republican philoſopher. Thoſe who recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the infinite tenderneſs with which the great Roman orator ſpeaks, in his Letters, of his darling Tullia, will forgive and pity the unhappy father, whoſe exceſs of affliction led him ſo far to forget his own philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical principles as to think very ſeriouſly of building, not a tomb, but a temple, to his departed child, as a proper object of worſhip. The Abbé Mongault has clearly aſcertained this intention of Cicero, in his intereſting remarks on the Fanum Tulliae, in the Memoirs of the French Academy.</p>

The reſpectable Lactantius, in particular, allows him his exiſtence and his ingenuity, but deſcribes him as employing his rare powers to the baſeſt of purpoſes, to promote the prepoſterous ambition of his relation Jupiter; and as contriving, by his ſculptural art, to convert the tyrant into a god<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>Of an intereſting character, ſo long the ſport and victim of fancy, fable, and conjecture, it is natural to deſire, but very difficult to obtain, a ſimple, rational hiſtory. Who ſhall ſolve the doubt whether Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus really exiſted or not? He has been called a Cretan, an Aegyptian, a Scythian; and Olaus Rudbecke, in that marvellous work of extenſive erudition and fanciful ingenuity, his Atlantica, ſeems inclined to make him a Swede, and claim him for a countryman with the reſt of the Titans. Of our own modern writers, Lord Bacon and Mr. Bryant (two reſpectable names) agree with the emperor Julian in their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to melt this primaeval artiſt into a mere allegory. I confeſs myſelf rather inclined to the opinion of the learned and intelligent Brucker, who, in his elaborate and candid Hiſtory of Philoſophy, has very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly ſtated ſuch conjectures of his own, concerning this celebrated perſonage, as account, in a very probable manner, for all his fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous adventures. This author imagines that Prometheus was a ſervant, high in the confidence of Oſiris, an Aegyptian monarch, who ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without the permiſſion of his ſovereign, to communicate the arts of Aegypt to the ruder Greeks, was impriſoned for that offence, and tormented, till the Aegyptian officer who guarded him was ſlain by Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,

                  <p>The following works of public magnificence are aſcribed to Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis:</p>
                  <q>She built likewiſe two palaces at each end of the bridge upon the bank of the river (Euphrates). That on the weſt had an high and ſtately wall, made of a round circumference, upon which were pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed in the bricks, before they were burnt, all ſorts of living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as if it were to the life, laid with great art, in curious colours. This wall was in circuit forty furlongs, three hundred bricks thick, and in height (as Cteſias ſays) a hundred yards, upon which were turrets a hundred and forty yards high. The third and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wall immediately ſurrounded the palace thirty furlongs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and far ſurmounted the middle wall both in height and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and on this wall and the towers were repreſented the ſhapes of all ſorts of living creatures, artificially expreſſed in moſt lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Eſpecially was repreſented a general hunting of all ſorts of wild beaſts, each four cubits high and upwards. Amongſt theſe was to be ſeen Semiramis on horſeback, ſtriking a leopard through with a dart; and next to her, her huſband Ninus in cloſe fight with a lion, piercing him with his lance. This palace far excelled that on the other ſide of the river, both in greatneſs and adornments; for the outmoſt wall of that (made of well-burnt brick) was but thirty furlongs in compaſs. Inſtead of the curious portraiture of beaſts, there were the brazen ſtatues of Ninus and Semiramis, the great officers, and of Jupiter, whom the Babylonians call Belus, and likewiſe armies drawn up in battalia; and divers ſorts of hunting were there repreſented, to

the great diverſion and pleaſure of the beholders. In the middle of the city ſhe built a temple to Jupiter, whom the Babylonians call Belus. Upon the top ſhe placed three ſtatues, of beaten gold, of Jupiter, Juno, and Rhea. That of Jupiter ſtood upright, in the poſture as if he were walking. He was forty feet in height, and weighed a thouſand Babyloniſh talents. The ſtatue of Rhea was of the ſame weight, ſitting on a golden throne, having two lions ſtanding on either ſide, one at her knees, and near to them two exceeding great ſerpents of ſilver, weighing thirty talents apiece. Here likewiſe the image of Juno ſtood upright, and weighed eight hundred talents, graſping a ſerpent by the head in her right hand, and holding a ſceptre, adorned with precious ſtones, in her left.

                  <p>Such are the wonders of early art which Diodorus has recorded as the works of Semiramis, on the authority of Cteſias, a native of Cnidos, who became the favourite phyſician of a Perſian monarch, Artaxerxes Mnemon, and in that ſituation had better opportunities of acquiring hiſtorical information concerning the antiquities of Aſia, than his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen in general poſſeſſed. Of Cteſias's extenſive writings only a few fragments remain, which are printed as a ſupplement to Herodotus, in the beſt editions of that hiſtorian. The credit of Cteſias has been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely attacked, both by ancient and modern writers; but M. Freret vindicates his veracity in ſeveral particulars, like a very able advocate, in more than one of his elaborate diſſertations on points of ancient hiſtory, inſerted in the Memoirs of the French Academy. The kind of credit that we may rationally give to the curious deſcription that I have cited, ſeems to be very candidly aſcertained by the Abbé Guaſco, who thinks that although works of ſuch magnificence were hardly executed at a period ſo early as that aſſigned to Semiramis, yet it is probable that ſuch actually appeared in Babylon in later ages, but before art had made
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0394000300:201"/>
any conſiderable progreſs in Greece or in Aegypt. <q>Quelque exagerée qu'on a raiſon de croire la deſcription que fait Cteſias des monumens de l'art ſtatuaire qui ornoient les palais et le temple, pretendus bâtis par l'ancienne Semiramis, quelqu' anachroniſme que l'on ſuppoſe à juſte titre, dans les époques données par cet auteur fabuleux à ces monumens: il n'en reſulte pas moins que cet art avoit déjà fait de grands progrès en Aſie durant les anciennes monarchies de Ninive, et de Babylone; car aucun art ne produit de grands monumens tout-à-coup, et ce n'eſt que ſucceſſivement qu'il atteint certains degrès de perfection. Donc quoique les ſtatues de Belus, de Semiramis, de Ninus, avec tout le brillant cortege et appareil, qui les accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoient, ne fuſſent pas des productions d'une époque ſi reculée, mais des monumens poſterieurs, executés ſous quelqu'un de leurs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeurs du même nom, qui voulut immortaliſer par là les fondateurs de leurs monarchies, il n'eſt pas moins conſtant, que ces monumens ſurpaſſoient en elegance et peut-être en antiquité, les premiers que l'on connoiſſe dans la Greee, et peut-être même ceux d'Aegypte: ils ſont tout au moins des indicés que l'on s'étoit déjà exercé depuis long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems dans ces ſortes d'ouvrages.</q>

                  <p>The ſame reſpectable author obſerves that Joſephus and Herodotus attribute, with more reaſon, theſe embelliſhments of Babylon to Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodonoſor, and Nitocris his wife; and that their account is confirmed by what the prophet Daniel has ſaid concerning the ſtatues of gold and ſilver which adorned the temples of that city. He adds, that Aſſyria had more than one Semiramis: <q>Parceque ce nom n'étant qu'une ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion generique compoſée de pluſieurs titres de dignité ſelon le genre et la tournure ordinaire de la langue orientale, il fût commun à pluſieurs reines d'Aſſyrie.—<bibl>

pointing to the manſion of the divinity, as if to acknowledge her own paſt offence in having arrogated to herſelf the honours due only to Juno.

It conſiſted of the figure of a dove, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably circled with the iris, as thoſe two emblems were often repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented together. All who went under that ſtandard, or who paid any deference to that emblem, were ſtiled Semarim or Samorim.</q>

                  <p>Daedalus was univerſally revered by antiquity as the father of Grecian ſculpture: but in proportion as his genius became an object of public veneration, his perſonal hiſtory was ſo involved in the decorations or diſguiſes of fable, that (to the regret of thoſe who love to inveſtigate the lives of meritorious men) it is hardly poſſible to obtain a ſatisfactory account of this celebrated ſculptor, architect, and mechaniſt, whoſe early and ſucceſsful ingenuity has ſo juſtly endeared his name to every lover of art.</p>
                  <p>The learned Junius has aſſigned a very copious article to Daedalus, in his catalogue of antient artiſts; and the Abbé Gedoyn (the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tranſlator of Quintilian and Pauſanias) has introduced a hiſtory of Daedalus into the Memoirs of the French Academy. Theſe two elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate writers have collected all that antiquity could furniſh to elucidate his life; but they both ſeem to admit, as an eſtabliſhed fact, one moſt diſhonourable circumſtance in the hiſtory of their hero, which I am inclined to conſider as not more entitled to ſerious credit than the moſt fabulous portion of his adventures; I mean, the horrid ſuppoſition that he enviouſly murdered his nephew and his diſciple, for poſſeſſing inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity ſuperior to his own.</p>
                  <p>Of this I ſhall ſpeak in its place: let me firſt relate the more early particulars that ancient writers have recorded concerning this celebrated ſculptor. He was by birth an Athenian; and though authors differ on the name of his father, they agree in repreſenting him as the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0394000300:208"/>
or great-grandſon of Erectheus, the ſixth ſovereign of Athens; and Pauſanias aſſerts that he lived in the period when Oedipus reigned in Thebes; that is, about half a century before the ſiege of Troy. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus, who may be called the earlieſt biographer of Daedalus that we poſſeſs, deſcribes him as having greatly improved the rude ſculpture of his age, and excited the admiration of his contemporaries, before the charge of having deſtroyed his diſciple reduced him to the neceſſity of flying from his country.</p>
                  <p>In the account that Diodorus has given of this very improbable crime, there is one particular that ſeems to mark the whole ſtory as a fabulous invention. It is ſaid that this ingenious diſciple, the ſon of his ſiſter, was led to invent a ſaw by the accident of finding the jaw of a ſerpent, and by obſerving the uſe to which its teeth might be ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully applied. It is alſo ſaid that Daedalus, being ſurpriſed and queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the act of burying the murdered youth, anſwered, that he was conſigning a ſerpent to the earth.</p>
                  <p>The hiſtorian mentions it as a wonder (and it ſeems one of thoſe ſpecious wonders, which the Greeks were ſo fond of inventing) that the ſame animal (the ſerpent) ſhould prove both the ſource of a moſt uſeful invention, and the means of detecting an execrable crime. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed criminal is ſaid to have been condemned by that ſolemn tribunal the Areopagus: but the mode in which the royal ſculptor is imagined to have accompliſhed the deſtruction of his diſciple is ſuch, that it could hardly admit any legal proof of a murderous intention. Ovid has briefly and forcibly ſtated the circumſtance to which I allude:
<q>
                        <l>Daedalus invidit, ſacraque ex arce Minervae</l>
                        <l>Praecipitem miſit, lapſum mentitus.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0394000300:209"/>The poet adds, that the falling youth was metamorphoſed into a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge by the pity of Minerva; and I confeſs that I conſider the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis and the murder as equally fabulous.</p>
                  <p>Every good mind that reflects on the ſubject will eſteem it hardly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a man in an elevated rank of life, and bleſt himſelf with a variety of talents, could be induced to murder a promiſing youth whom he had engaged to inſtruct, and the child of his own ſiſter, for diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch ingenuity as a maſter and a relation would be naturally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to admire and encourage. A fact of this complexion ought, for the honour of human nature, never to be admitted, except in caſes where the evidence that ſupports it is irreſiſtible.</p>
                  <p>For the glory of Daedalus we may affirm, that the improbable atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city imputed to him is ſo far from being proved by any teſtimony, that it reſts only on dark tradition; and the whole ſtory has ſo much the air of a fable, that it ought long ago to have been diſcountenanced and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded by every ſerious biographer of this illuſtrious artiſt. Yet writers are ſo apt to tranſcribe the wonderful tales of their predeceſſors without examination, or to credit enormities aſcribed to men of talents and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, that this barbarous ſtory has been credulouſly repeated from age to age. The modern and enlightened authors who have recently diſcuſſed the hiſtory of Daedalus do not ſcruple to paint him as an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiſin. The Abbé Gedoyn endeavours to varniſh his own cruel credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity on this ſubject by the following remark: <q>De tout tems une baſſe jalouſie a été le vice des artiſans, même de ceux qui font profeſſion des arts les plus nobles; j'en pourrois citer pluſieurs exemples en France, comme ailleurs.</q>

At all events I have a pleaſure in perſuading myſelf that he was as clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as he was confeſſedly ingenious. When he removed from At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, whatever the cauſe of that removal might be, he is ſaid to have obtained the friendſhip of Minos, the ſecond of that name, who reigned in Crete; and to have executed, in wood, two ſtatues of Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra and Ariadne, the celebrated daughters of the Cretan monarch. In Crete he is reported to have built a labyrinth of marvellous intricacy, and copied, on a ſmaller ſcale, from a portentous edifice of Aegypt. He muſt have ſtudied, therefore, the works of Aegyptian art in their own country, before his viſit to Crete. The Cretans were ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their groſs deviation from truth; and the narrative of ſome ſculptural works aſcribed to Daedalus, in their iſland, contains the moſt filthy and diſguſting fable that ever ſullied the pages of fiction. The reader acquainted with mythology will immediately perceive that I allude to the fable of Paſiphae, the moſt cruelly calumniated queen that ever ſuffered from the licentiouſneſs of fancy. Some decent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of her ſtory have ſuppoſed that ſhe was enamoured of a Cretan officer who bore the name of Taurus, and that Daedalus was employed in aſſiſting their illicit attachment: but Lucian, with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable mixture of wit and good-nature, imagines the Taurus of Paſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phae's

affection to have been merely the ſign of the zodiac diſtinguiſhed by that appellation; and Deadalus is very happily metamorphoſed, by this ſuppoſition, from the culpable confident of a diſhonourable intrigue, into an innocent maſter of aſtronomy. But however blameleſs the intercourſe might be between the ſlandered Paſiphae and the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Athenian, Daedalus appears to have incurred the reſentment of the Cretan monarch, and to have been under the neceſſity of eſcaping from his dominion with ſecret rapidity. Hence aroſe the fable of his inventing wings for himſelf and his ſon Icarus; a fable ſo captivating to the fancy of the Latin poets, that Ovid has related it twice at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable length<note n="*" place="bottom">Metamorph. lib. viii. Artis Amatoriae, lib.ii.</note>. Virgil has embelliſhed it in a few verſes of ſingular delicacy and pathos. Horace, Silius Italicus, and Auſonius have all mentioned it occaſionally. The ancient and ſenſible interpreter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible fictions, Palaephatus, has turned the fabulous wings of Daeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus and his ſon into ſails. He aſſerts, that being impriſoned by Minos, they eſcaped from a window of their priſon, and embarked in a ſkiff: but being purſued by the veſſels of Minos, in tempeſtuous weather, the father only got ſafe to land and completed his eſcape. Apollodorus relates that Hercules found the body of Icarus caſt aſhore upon an iſland, to which he gave the name of Icaria, in honour of the youth, whom he buried. The ſame author adds, that Daedalus rewarded his illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friend for this humanity ſhewn to his unfortunate child, by exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting a ſtatue of Hercules, which that hero miſtaking in the night, for a living figure, is ſaid to have ſtruck with a ſtone. Pauſanias men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this ſtatue as preſerved by the Thebans in a temple of Hercules, and gives a ſimilar account of its origin as a tribute of gratitude from the afflicted father, whoſe eſcape from Crete he alſo aſcribes, like Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laephatus, to the uſe of ſails. Though Virgil and Silius Italicus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Daedalus as building the temple of the Cumaean Apollo, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

after his eſcape from the tyranny of Minos, the Greek hiſtorian of his adventures ſuppoſes him to have proceeded from Crete to Sicily, and to have ingratiated himſelf ſo ſucceſsfully with Cocalus, a prince of that country, that when Minos, with a naval force, purſued and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the fugitive, his generous protector, inſtead of betraying his ingenious gueſt, from whoſe architectural talents he is ſaid to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived great advantage, endeavoured to negotiate with Minos in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. The Cretan monarch accepted the invitation of the Sicilian prince, and, according to the accounts of more than one ancient Greek author, the daughters of Cocalus contrived, from their partiality to the Athenian artiſt, to deſtroy his formidable enemy; which they are ſaid to have accompliſhed by the means of a hot bath, in ſuch a manner, that the Cretans who attended their king ſuppoſed his death to be natural, and departed in peace with his remains—a tale that has much the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of fiction.</p>
                  <p>Daedalus is reported to have expreſſed his gratitude towards his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian protector by executing many ingenious works in his country. Diodorus relates that he built an impregnable palace for his royal friend; that he fortified and adorned the temple of Venus Erycina; and that he conſtructed a vapour-bath, in which the ſick were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly cured of their infirmities, without ſuffering from its heat<note n="*" place="bottom">

Concerning the latter days and death of Daedalus antiquity furniſhes no anecdotes: but the learned Abbé Gedoyn imagines, with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that from Italy he paſſed again into Aegypt, and ended his life in that country—an idea that he reſts on the authority of the Aegyptian prieſts, who reported, according to the narrative of Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Siculus, that Daedalus conſtructed a moſt beautiful veſtibule to the

temple of Vulcan at Memphis, and was held in ſuch veneration by the Aegyptians, that they placed in that temple a ſtatue which he had carved in wood of himſelf, and raiſed, in one of the adjacent iſlands, a temple to the artiſt, in which his memory was religiouſly worſhipped by the natives of that country.</p>

                  <p>Pauſanias records, with particular care, the more authentic works of Daedalus that remained in his time: his ſtatue of Hercules, at Thebes; of Trophonius, among the Lebadenſes in Boeotia: thoſe of Britomar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis and of Minerva, in Crete; with the dance of Ariadne, mentioned by Homer in the Iliad, and wrought on white marble; among the Delians, a Venus in wood, with her right hand periſhing by Time, and raiſed on a ſquare baſis inſtead of feet, "I am perſuaded," ſays Pauſanias, <q>that Ariadne received this image from Daedalus, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it with her, when ſhe attended Theſeus. The Delians affirm that Theſeus himſelf devoted it to their Apollo, that it might not, on his return to his own country, awaken in his mind a painful and paſſionate recollection of Ariadne.

                     <p>Cet ouvrage de ſculpture, executé près de cinq cents ans après l'in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention de la ſtatuaire, decrit environ trois ſiècles après Dedale par Homere, qui l'avoit aſſurement vu, puiſque Pauſanias, plus de mille ans depuis, reconnoit que c'eſt le même dont il eſt parlé dans l'Iliade, à laquelle, curieux obſervateur et ſavant comme il étoit, il n'avoit ſans doubte pas manqué de le comparer; car il l'avoit ſi bien exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miné qu'il ſpecifie même la matière dont il étoit fait; un tel monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0394000300:218"/>
dis-je, détaillé par un homme tel qu' Homère, dont on connoit l'exactitude dans les moindres details où il entre ſur les arts, eſt ſans doubte la preuve la plus authentique qui puiſſe jamais exiſter des grands progrès faits par la ſculpture au moins cent ans avant la priſe de Troye, et de l'erreur dans laquelle le peu de critique des anciens, mais ſur-tout de Pline, a jetté les modernes au ſujet de l'ancienneté des arts.....Ce bas rélief repréſentant deux tems d'une même action, étoit néceſſairement diviſé en deux parties, ou par une vaſe on par une colonne, comme on en a pluſieurs exemples dans les monumens an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques. Le premier de ces tableaux repréſentoit le commencement de la danſe, qui ſe mouvoit en cercle comme pour s'eſſayer; le Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryphée avec ſa compagne entonnoit la chanſon qui en étoit le motif, et que le reſte des danſeurs répétoit. Par les plis et replis de la figure qu'ils formoient, ils marquoient dans le ſecond tableau les tours et les détours du labyrinthe d'ou Théſée ſortit au moyen du fil dont Ariane l'avoit pourvu. Dédale, au rapport de Lucien, l'avoit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruite de cette danſe; et, ſuivant Homère, il en étoit l'inventeur. C'eſt le plus ancien ballet figuré dont il foit parlé dans les anciens auteurs; il fût le modèle de tous ceux qui repréſenterent depuis les actions et les moeurs des hommes: cet art, ſi l'on en croit Plutarque fût porté ſi loin qu'il approchoit plus de la poeſie, que la peinture même.</p>
                     <p>Il paroit que les draperies des figures de ce bas-relief colorées ſur le bouclier d'Achille, à l'aide des differens métaux qu'on y ſuppoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployés, l'étoient auffi ſur le marbre: dela vient cette expreſſion <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> pour marquer un choeur de diverſes couleurs. Nous avons déjà parlé des ſtatues de bois peintes et dorées faites avant Dédale: mais les anciens colorerent auſſi et dorérent le marbre, comme on le peut voir par la petite Iſis trouvée à Pompeia, par la Diane conſervée à Portici, par les cheveux de la belle Vénus de Medicis, et le diademe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0394000300:219"/>
de l'autre Vénus, conſervée avec la première, dans la tribune de la galerie de Florence. Je crois donc que les robes de lin et de laine, que portoient les danſeuſes et les danſeurs de ce bas-relief, étoient peintes, que les ceinturons de ces derniers étoient argentés, et que leurs epées étoient dorées.</p>
                     <p>Si l'on compare ce que dit Homère de ce monument, avec ce que Pauſanias et Platon ont écrit des autres ouvrages de Dédale, on verra que la compoſition de cette danſe ne pouvoit être mieux entendue ni plus riche ou plus agréable qu'elle l'étoit: elle ſemble avoir donné l'idée des heures, que l'on voit à la vigne Borghèſe, et de celles dont le Guide a entouré le char de l'Aurore qu'il a peinte dans le palais Roſpigliozi à Rome. Cependant on n'exécute jamais tout ce que l'on concoit, parceque l'habilité de la main, la connoiſſance des vrais principes de l'art et des moyens qu'il peut employer, ne répondent pas toujours à la grandeur du génie et des idées de celui qui com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: ſi l'on s'en rapporte au jugement de Pauſanias ſur le caractère des ſtatues de Dédale; on trouvera que l'exécution de ce bas-relief a dû être inférieure à ſa compoſition; que le ſtyle, quoique fort et vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goreux en dévoit être auſtère et privé de grace; ſi toutefois l'on s'en rapporte à Platon, il foudra croire que les figures employées à rendre ces belles idées, manquoient encore par l'exactitude du deſſin, et ſans doubte par la juſteſſe des proportions: mais il eſt aſſuré que l'on y voyoit les ſemences de tout ce que la ſculpture fit de mieux dans les tems poſtérieurs. Homère, qui s'il ſe fût adonné à la ſculpture ou à la peinture, eût aſſurement été auſſi habile ſculpteur ou peintre qu'il étoit grand poete, nous a deſſiné plutôt que décrit ce bas-relief, avec route la vérité et la ſimplicité qu'eût jamais pu y mettre le plus ſavant artiſte, en le rendant ſur le toile ou ſur le marbre. On croit le voir en liſant la copie qu'il en a faite; la matière ſeule en eſt dé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truite, mais il nous en a conſervé la partie la plus precieuſe: ſes vers,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0394000300:220"/>
comme autant de pinceaux donnent à la nature ce coloris et cette fraicheur qui la rendent ſi aimable. Il faut donc que malgré les reproches faits à Dédale, Homère ait trouvé dans ſon ouvrage ce gout et ce ſentiment, qui ſeuls ſont capables d'echauffer l'imagination, parcequ'ils touchent le coeur, peuvent inſpirer des idées riantes à l'eſprit par le ſouvenir des choſes agréables qu'ils lui rappellent, et fournir à tous deux les images charmantes dont il a fait uſage.</p>

                  <p>I have tranſcribed theſe copious remarks, becauſe they ſeem to place in a very fair and judicious point of view the merits of the early ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whoſe obſcure hiſtory I have wiſhed to illuſtrate. With ſuch a deſire, I have particularly to regret one of the loſt comedies aſcribed to Ariſtophanes, which bore the name of Daedalus: yet it is poſſible that ſuch a compoſition might not have afforded that clear light concerning the life and character of the artiſt, which we might eagerly expect from its title. As it was the favourite amuſement of Ariſtophanes to ridicule the tragic poets of his country, perhaps his Daedalus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained little more than a ludicrous parody on the Prometheus of Aeſchylus. However this might be, the name of Daedalus appears to have been generally honoured by the poets of Greece; and I haſten to conclude this attempt to elucidate and confirm his reputation with the words of a Greek epigram, that repreſent him as a paragon of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence:

The firſt, a native of Sicyon, acquired celebrity by many ſtatues that are mentioned by Pliny and Pauſanias. The latter was probably a Bithynian, as he is ſuppoſed to have executed, at Nicomedia, a wonderful image of Jupiter, the patron of armies<note n="*" place="bottom">

deſcriber of his ſculptural works ſpeaks highly of the figures that he executed in braſs, particularly thoſe of Neptune and Amphitrite. That the Lacedemonians had a ſtrong paſſion for ſculpture ſeems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from the magnificence of their Amyclaean Apollo, whoſe throne was decorated by Bathycles, an artiſt of Magneſia, and compriſed, as M. de Caylus has juſtly obſerved, an epitome of ancient mythology. Winkelman ſuppoſes Bathycles to have lived in the age of Solon. One ſingular advantage which the Spartans expected to derive from the poſſeſſion of fine ſtatues was to improve the beauty of their offspring; a ſource of their partiality both to ſculpture and to painting which Junius has explained in the following paſſage: <q>Lacedaemonii quondam in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquis horridiores, pulcherrimas quaſque picturas in ſummo ſemper habuerunt pretio; dicuntur enim de liberorum ſuorum pulchritudine tantopere ſolliciti fuiſſe, ut formoſiſſimorum adoleſcentium Nirei, Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſi, Hiacinthi, Caſtoris et Pollucis, deorumque ſpecioſiſſimorum Apollinis nempe ac Bacchi effigies gravidis uxoribus repraeſentarent. <bibl>JUNIUS, <hi>de Pictura Veterum,</hi> p. 71.</bibl>

                  <p>Anthermus, a ſculptor in the iſland of Chios, had two ſons of his own profeſſion, Bupalus and Athenis. The brothers became famous by works of conſiderable merit in their art; and ſtill more ſo by their degrading it into an inſtrument of malevolence againſt the poet Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax. This animated but ill-favoured bard, diſtinguiſhed by mental ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and perſonal deformity, is ſuppoſed to have been in love with the daughter of Bupalus, who, to prevent a connexion that he diſliked, is ſaid to have exhibited a caricatura of the formidable lover. The exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated poet retaliated by a ſatire of ſuch ſeverity againſt the offending ſculptors, that, according to tradition, it made them frantic, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to ſuicide—a ſtory which, as Pliny juſtly obſerves upon it, was ſufficiently refuted by their ſubſequent productions.</p>
                  <p>Their caricature of Hipponax (perhaps the firſt caricature upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord) is ſuppoſed by D'Hancarville to have ſuggeſted to Theſpis, their contemporary, the idea of furniſhing his actors with a maſk, inſtead of colouring their faces with vermilion. The ſatire of the vindictive poet, though we may hope it did not produce the horrible effect aſcribed to it, appears to have given celebrity to its indignant author. The Greek Anthologia contains no leſs than four inſcriptions on this powerful ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiriſt. I have ſelected the two beſt of them, for the amuſement of my reader:</p>

                  <p>Hipponax was a native of Epheſus, and he is celebrated by Athenaeus as the inventor of parody: but his title to that invention is in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure controverted by the Abbé Sallier, in his Diſſertation on the Origin and Character of Parody, in the Memoirs of the French Academy. Bayle has an article on Hipponax, in which he has collected many curious examples of perſons who have ſuffered from the dangerous ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of literary vengeance. The enmity between the ſculptor of Chios and the Epheſian ſatiriſt will probably recall to the recollection of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0394000300:227"/>
an Engliſh reader the ſimilar enmity between thoſe bitter and powerful antagoniſts, Hogarth and Churchill.</p>
                  <p>From the ſlight fragments that remain of Hipponax, I am inclined to believe that his Satires, celebrated as they have been, were inferior in genius, and perhaps in acrimony, to the vindictive performance of the Engliſh poet, which contains ſo many beautiful paſſages, (beautiful both in ſentiment and expreſſion,) that although good-nature muſt wiſh the quarrel which produced it had never exiſted, the poem is ſtill admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as a maſterpiece of poetical indignation.</p>

                  <p>I follow the authority of Cicero, Vitruvius, and Quintilian in nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Myron as the earlieſt of the more accompliſhed Grecian ſculptors, who acquired infinite celebrity by making near approaches to perfection in their art. Pauſanias ſpeaks of Myron as an Athenian: but Pliny affirms that he was born at Eleutherae, (a city of Baeotia,) and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Agelades, an artiſt of Argos. The Bacchus of Myron is ſaid by Pauſanias to have excelled all his other productions, except his ſtatue of Erectheus at Athens: but this very diligent artiſt appears to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted many works of conſiderable excellence, and to have been moſt commended for what he probably regarded as a trifling performance. I allude to his famous heifer of braſs, celebrated by no leſs than thirty-ſix epigrams in the Greek Anthologia; upon which the French ſculptor
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0394000300:232"/>
Falconet ſays, with ſome pleaſantry and ſome juſtice, <q>Les Atheniens étoient les François de la Grèce, et devoient faire autant de jolis vers ſur un vache que nous en avons faits ſur la chatte en ſculpture de Madame de Leſdiguières<note n="*" place="bottom">Traduction des 34, 35, et 36 Livres de Pline, avec des Notes par Etienne Falconet, tom. i. p. 85.</note>.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ought, however, to obſerve, for the credit of Athens, that theſe epigrams are far from having been all produced by her citizens. They form, altogether, ſuch a heap of inſipid compliments as would not, I think, have appeared very flattering to an artiſt of Attic genius. The following, I believe, is one of the beſt of them:</p>

                  <p>Strabo has recorded that the iſland of Samos contained three coloſſal divinities by Myron, on one baſis.

As to the minuter works of Myron, Pliny has mentioned his monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a graſshopper as celebrated in the verſes of the poeteſs Erinna; a <hi>luſus</hi> of art executed probably to pleaſe ſome fanciful fair to whom the ſculptor might be tenderly attached.

ſtatue, but the moſt ſatisfactory account of it is contained in a paſſage of Galen, quoted by Junius, which expreſsly ſays that it was deſigned to confirm thoſe principles of art which the ſculptor taught in writing upon ſymmetry; and that both his treatiſe and his ſtatue were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by a common name, "The canon of Polycletus<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <q>Ces Commentaires de Polyclete, malheureuſement perdus aujourd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hui, ayant été regardés autrefois comme la regle conſtamment ſuivie depuis ſon tems juſqu'à celui des Antonins, Menechme, Xenocrates, Apelles, qui vécurent dans cet intervalle, ayant compoſé différens ouvrages ſur les raiſons de l'art, on ne peut douter qu'il n'aient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenu les principes de Polyclete ſur les ſymmétries, et nous les y retrouverions ſi le tems n'eût pas détruit ces écrits. Mais comme à ſon imitation les plus habiles artiſtes de l'antiquité firent leurs ſtatues d'après les regles établies dans ſes livres nous pouvons retrouver dans les plus belles ſtatues antiques les proportions qu'il enſeignoit devoir y entrer, et juger, d'après ces proportions, ſur quoi ſe fondoit la thé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orie des principes renfermés dans les ouvrages des anciens ſur les <hi>ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metries</hi> et la <hi>beauté idèale.</hi>

                  <p>The author purſues his idea in diſcuſſing proportions relating to the face, collected by Mengs, and cited by Winkelman, from the fineſt ſpecimens of ancient ſculpture. Into the minutiae of ſuch a diſcuſſion the intent of this work does not lead me to enter. He draws an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from theſe reſearches which I confeſs myſelf unwilling to allow; for he ſays:</p>

                  <p>With an enthuſiaſtic eſteem and admiration for the excellence of the Greeks in art and in literature, the moderns ought to cheriſh a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion that even that excellence, great as it is, may poſſibly be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed. Such an idea may be cenſured as preſumptuous: but in every arduous purſuit a degree of preſumption is the very ſource of ſucceſs. Reaſon and fancy may unite in refuſing to believe that, in cultivating the fine arts, any nation, or any individual has yet arrived at the utmoſt limits of attainable perfection. In ſculpture, indeed, it is not very probable that any modern artiſt, in any part of the globe, may poſſeſs all the advantages to lead him to excellence which the ſculptors of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity poſſeſſed; yet the modern may avail himſelf of ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to which the ancient was a ſtranger. But I forbear to enter on a topic which may be more properly diſcuſſed when modern art is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſubject before us.—I return to Polycletus.</p>
                  <p>Winkelman has ſtyled him a ſublime poet in his art; and he ſeems, indeed, to have enjoyed that rare mixture of induſtry, confidence, and imagination which is ſo favourable to felicity in the works of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>

He gratified the multitude in this manner: According to the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of all his viſitors, he retouched and altered ſomething in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the opinion of each.

                  <p>The talents and reputation of Phidias were ſo great, that they are allowed to form the moſt honourable aera in the hiſtory of art. The Abbé Gedoyn has added to his hiſtory of Daedalus an account of this his moſt illuſtrious ſucceſſor, for the ſake of diſplaying at once, in the lives of theſe two memorable men, the commencement and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſculpture. Athens had the honour of giving birth to them
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0394000300:242"/>
both; for Phidias, by the authority of Plato, is proved to be an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian. He ſtudied under two maſters of no great celebrity, Agelas and Hippias: but he had the advantage of having two brothers diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their talents as painters, and the ſtill greater advantage of having cultivated and brought to maturity his own genius, at that fortunate period when the triumphant ſtate of his country, and the magnificent ſpirit of Pericles, afforded him a moſt favourable field for its exertion. With what patriotic pride and delight muſt an Attic ſculptor have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted his powers in converting that very marble, which the Perſian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders had brought with them to form a trophy of their conqueſt, into a memorial of their defeat! I allude to the Nemeſis of Phidias, a ſtatue executed under theſe animating circumſtances, according to Pauſanias, and ſtationed in a temple at Rhamnus, at the diſtance of ſixty ſtadia from Marathon—a ſtatue, celebrated in the following epigram:</p>

                     </note>: but when the rival goddeſſes were raiſed to their intended height, Alcamenes became the jeſt, and Phidias the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of the people.</p>
                  <p>Such is the amuſing ſtory of Tzetzes. What degree of ſerious credit it may deſerve I leave to the judgment of my reader, and haſten to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the two moſt celebrated works of Phidias; his more magnificent Minerva, ſtationed as the patroneſs of Athens in her temple called Parthenon; and the ſtatue extolled as the maſterpiece of antiquity, his Olympian Jupiter at Elis.</p>
                  <p>Pauſanias deſcribes this Minerva as an upright figure, with a garment deſcending to her feet. He does not mention her height; but M. de Caylus, from the expreſſion of Pliny, (cubitorum viginti ſex,) eſtimates it at thirty-nine feet, of the French meaſure. <q>The coſtly ſplendor of the ſtatue,</q> ſays Winkelman, <q>may be conceived from the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of gold employed in its decoration. This, as we learn from a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0394000300:246"/>
ſpeech of Pericles preſerved in Thucydides, amounted to forty ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; the drapery was of gold, and the uncovered parts of the figure formed of ivory.</q> The latter material was alſo employed in the head of Meduſa that appeared on the breaſt of the goddeſs, according to the deſcription of Pauſanias; and perhaps gold and ivory were united in the image of Victory of four cubits, that was placed in one of her hands; though its poſition is not aſcertained by Pauſanias, who only ſays that in her hand ſhe held a ſpear. But the ſmaller figure of Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory that was frequently added as a decoration to a coloſſal ſtatue, and diſplayed in the extended hand of the triumphant divinity, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of ſolid gold, as we may conjecture from the profane jeſt of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius, the tyrant of Syracuſe, who, in ſtealing ſuch figures, ſaid it would be folly not to take from the gods what they appeared to offer.— But to return to the Minerva of Phidias. Pliny ſays that on the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſide of her ſhield the battle of the Amazons was repreſented; and in the concave part, the conflict between the giants and the gods. Nay, even her ſandals were decorated, according to his account, with the battle of the Centaurs and the Lapithae.</p>
                  <p>M. de Caylus has ventured to criticiſe, with a becoming ſpirit, theſe minute decorations:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Après avoir remercié Pline de nous avoir conſervé ces details, qui ne ſe trouvent dans aucun autre auteur, on' me trouvëra ſans doute hardi, et peut-être temeraire, d'oſer deſapprouver ces petits ouvrages en eux-mêmes. Je ne doute pointe aſſurement de leur mérite et de leur perfection; mais je dirai franchement que ſans parler de l'in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terieur du bouclier, dont je laiſſe à juger pour la poſſibilité du coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'oeil, ces beaux details étoient en pure perte; car il eſt conſtant qu'il n'auroit pas été poſſible de les diſtinguer, quand meme la figure auroit été de grandeur naturelle. Mais quoique le bouclier pût avoir dix pieds de diametre, on ne pouvoit examiner ſes ornemens aſſez
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0394000300:247"/>
près, en quelque endroit qu'il ait été placé pour en juger ſainement ſur une figure d'environ quarante pieds de proportion, d'autant qu'elle étoit placée ſur un piédeſtal qui l'élevoit encore tout au moins de dix ou de quinze. Cette figure, pour être auſſi belle que toute l'antiquité l'a declarée, devoit être entendue et formée par de grandes maſſes, et ces maſſes devoient néceſſairement abſorber un auſſi grand nombre de petits details. Il faut convenir que les anciens paroiſſent les avoir aimés .... Cependant pour faire mieux entendre mon eſpèce de critique, je comparerai ces petits travaux à ceux d'un peintre, qui faiſant le portrait d'une femme auſſi grand que la nature, auroit grand ſoin de peindre en miniature un autre portrait qu'elle auroit au bras. Je demande ſi le travail et la diſpoſition du grand portrait ne feroient pas abſolument évanouir le mérite et l'ouvrage du braſſelet. Cepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant il s'en faut beaucoup que la compariſon ſoit en proportion avec le point duquel je ſuis parti.</p>
                     <p>Cette ſtatue de Minerve preſente encore une difficulté, elle étoit d'or et d'yvoire, et elle avoit à ſes pieds un ſerpent et un ſphinx de bronze. Quel alliage de couleurs et de matières! on a peine à con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cevoir leur agrément.—</p>

Cette ſtatue eſt ſi haute, que l'aigrette du caſque et la pointe de la pique peuvent étre aperçues de Sunium.' C'eſt-à-dire de cinque lieues d'Athènes.</p>
                     <p>Le minutieux Pauſanias, qui ne fait grace de rien à ſon lecteur, parle ailleurs de la Minerve du Parthénon, qui étoit, comme on fait, dans la citadelle d'Athènes, et ne dit pas un mot de toute cette ciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, gravure, &amp;c. dont Pline fait mention; details qu'il ne manque cependant jamais d'écrire, quand il en a l'occaſion. Ne ſe pourroit-il pas que les deux Minerves de Phidias euſſent été confondües dans la tête de l'ecrivain Latin, et qu'il eut attribué à l'une ce qui apartenoit à l'autre? Je ſuis loin de la vouloir aſſurer; mais j'aimerois mieux Pline avec un défaut de memoire, que Phidias avec un défaut de goût; cela ne ſe compare pas.</p>
                     <p>Ne ſeroit il pas poſſible encore, comme il eſt dit plus haut, qu'on eut chargé d'ornemens ſuperflus cette Minerve de Phidias quelques années après ſa mort, comme on avoit fait celle de bronze?

                  <p>Plutarch conſiders the baſe attempt to ruin Phidias in the eſteem of the Athenians as a political manoeuvre to try the public influence of his patron Pericles. We owe to that invaluable biographer the anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote to which I have alluded in the Poem: I mean the friendly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution of Pericles, by which he protected the ſculptor from the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous accuſation of having embezzled a part of the gold conſigned to him for the decoration of Minerva. By the advice of his illuſtrious friend, the artiſt is ſaid to have contrived the golden habiliments of the goddeſs in ſuch a manner that they might be eaſily removed, and his probity aſcertained by the infallible teſt of the ſcales.</p>
                  <p>The vindication of his innocence in this important article did not ſecure Phidias from the inſidious rancour of his enemies. He was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of alluring the chaſte matrons of Athens to his houſe, under the pretence of ſhewing his ſtatues, for the diſhonourable purpoſe of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the licentious paſſions of his patron.

periſed in priſon, under the popular indignation which this calumny excited: but the indefatigable Meurſius has proved, by the authority of an old ſcholiaſt on Ariſtophanes, that the perſecuted artiſt eſcaped to Elis, and ended his days with honour in a ſcene which he is ſuppoſed to have adorned, in gratitude for the protection it afforded him, with the ſublimeſt work of ſculpture that was ever produced, even by Grecian talents—his Olympian Jupiter; an image which he conceived, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own ingenuous account, from Homer's deſcription of the god<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>How deplorable was the fate of Athens, repeatedly the captive of two, the moſt artful, ſanguinary, and impious wretches that diſhonoured the liſt of ancient heroes—Lyſander and Sylla! Both theſe barbarous conquerors had a paſſion for ſculpture; ſo great was the influence of that powerful art over the ſterneſt ſpirits of antiquity! Plutarch informs us, that after Lyſander had taken Athens, he devoted a part of his ſpoil to the expence of raiſing his own ſtatue, and thoſe of his officers, at Delphi. Yet ſo truly ſavage was this deteſtable victor, that Plutarch rather ſeems to believe the report he mentions of Lyſander's having propoſed, in the council of the allies, to reduce the Athenians to ſlavery. A Theban officer, according to the ſame authority, propoſed the utter demolition of the city; and Athens is ſaid to have been ſaved by the happy voice of a Phocenſian, who ſung to the conquerors, at a banquet, a few verſes from a tragedy of Euripides, which awakened their humanity, and made them ſhrink from their horrible purpoſe of annihilating a city ſo admirable, and the parent of men ſo illuſtrious.</p>

                  <p>Sculpture is aſſuredly one of the moſt difficult of the fine arts; yet it is a ſtriking truth that Greece produced ſeveral ſculptors of the firſt rate, though ſhe could only boaſt a ſingle Homer. It is alſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the Grecian ſculptors were more numerous than the painters of their country. That intelligent and contemplative obſerver of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, M. de Caylus, has had the curioſity to compare their reſpective numbers, as far as the narratives of Pauſanias and Pliny enabled him to make the compariſon. Of the former he ſays: <q>Il ne fait mention que de quinze peintres, tandis qu'il diſtingue de la manière la plus claire cent ſoixante et neuf ſculpteurs. Il faut cependant convenir que Pline fait mention de cent trente-trois peintres Grecs, bons ou médi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocres..... On pourroic repondre pour concilier les deux auteurs, que Pline a parlé de tous les peintres de la Grèce, de l'Aſie Mineure, de la Sicile, et de ce que l'on appelloit la grande Grèce, &amp;c. et que Pauſanias n'a pas même viſité toute la Grèce proprement dite, qu'il n'écrivoit point l'hiſtoire des artiſtes, et qu'il parloit ſeulement de ceux dont il avoit vû les ouvrages; ouvrages dont le nombre étoit encore diminué, par l'avidité des Romains, qui dévaſtoient ce pays depuis environs quatre-vingt ans; à compter le tems qui s'étoit écoulé depuis Pline juſqu'à lui.</q>

                  <p>Scopas, a native of Paros, is mentioned by Pliny as a contemporary with Myron and Polycletus, in the 87th Olympiad. He is repreſented alſo, by the ſame author, and by Vitruvius, as one of the eminent artiſts employed by the magnificent Artemiſia in decorating the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her huſband Mauſolus.</p>
                  <p>But as a ſculptor, who lived ſo early, could hardly have been living at the time when that ſumptuous monument was raiſed, Winkelman conjectures that more than one artiſt was diſtinguiſhed by the name of Scopas. It ſeems rather more probable that Pliny was miſtaken in the period he aſſigned to this admirable ſculptor; and indeed the chronology of almoſt all the ancient artiſts, and their moſt memorable works, is ſo full of perplexities and contradiction, that miſtakes of this kind are almoſt unavoidable in a curſory view of their productions.</p>
                  <p>The works of Scopas ſeem to have been full of fancy and feeling; yet it is not eaſy to form an exact idea of his three ſtatues, repreſenting the variations of Love, as they are briefly deſcribed by Pauſanias<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        </gap>. The commentator on Pauſanias, to elucidate theſe three Greek titles of Cupid, refers his reader to the Grecian Phurnutus "De Natura Deorum:" but on conſulting Phurnutus, I find no light, but rather the "darkneſs viſible" of ridiculous etymologies.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Pliny has enumerated many works of Scopas, that held, in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod when he wrote, a very high rank among the ſculptural decorations

of Rome. The Palatine Apollo, a ſitting Veſta with two female attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and a collection of marine divinities, which, according to the lively expreſſion of the enthuſiaſtic Pliny, might be termed a glorious performance, if it had employed the whole life of the artiſt<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>M. de Caylus imagines that theſe Nereids, riding on their ſea-horſes, were executed in bas-relief. Falconet is of a different opinion. It is, however, probable that they were ſo, and that they are ſtill preſerved.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen admirable ſketches of ſuch Nereids as anſwer to Pliny's deſcription, executed at Rome by Mr. Howard, an Engliſh artiſt, who has the rare talent of drawing from ſculpture with ſuch preciſion and delicacy, that England may ſoon ſurpaſs other countries in a juſt and graceful repreſentation of thoſe ancient ſtatues which her men of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and taſte have collected; eſpecially as the Dilettanti Society have judiciouſly confided to this artiſt the conduct of ſuch a work, peculiarly calculated to diſplay his abilities, and to reflect an honour on their own inſtitution. It is much to be lamented, that almoſt all the prints, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to illuſtrate the many voluminous and coſtly books upon ſculpture, are rather caricatures of ancient art, than a faithful copy of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the ancient artiſt whoſe works are the immediate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this note.—Pliny has very highly praiſed a Venus by Scopas, and is ſuppoſed to have ſaid that it excelled the Gnidian Venus of Praxiteles, which he had juſt celebrated as the moſt beautiful ſtatue to be found on earth. Falconet, with his uſual petulance, derides Pliny for ſo groſs a contradiction; and even his liberal friend and admirer, M. de Caylus, laments this ſtriking inconſiſtency. Let me hazard
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0394000300:258"/>
what appears to me a probable conjecture, to ſave the credit of an author to whom the lovers of art have infinite obligation. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that all the blame which Pliny has incurred for this ſuppoſed contradiction aroſe ſolely from a ſlip of the pen in the original manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript: but to elucidate the point, I muſt tranſcribe the paſſage as it ſtands, and add the new reading I wiſh to introduce: <q>Praeterea Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in eodem loco nuda Praxitelicam illam Gnidiam antecedens, et quemcunque alium locum nobilitatura.</q>—According to the preſent reading, there is not only a contradiction of what he had juſt aſſerted concerning the pre-eminence of the Gnidian ſtatue, but the latter part of the ſentence has little or no meaning. By the following ſlight change in the orthography the abſurd contradiction will be utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and a ſignificant ſpirit will appear in the cloſe of the ſentence: <q>Praeterea Venus in eodem loco nuda Praxitelicam illam Gnidi <hi>non</hi> antecedens, <hi>at</hi> quemcunque alium locum nobilitatura.</q>—<q>A naked Venus, not ſurpaſſing, indeed, that of Praxiteles at Gnidos, but ſuch as would ennoble any other place.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pliny mentions it as a doubt, in his age, whether the Niobe at Rome is the work of Praxiteles or of Scopas. M. de Caylus makes a pleaſant remark on the modeſty of the Roman author, and recommends it as a leſſon to modern connoiſſeurs:</p>
                  <q>On doit lui ſavoir gré de l'aveu de ſon ignorance ſur le nom des auteurs des ouvrages, qui decoroient la ville de Rome. Il donne en ce cas une leçon à tous les curieux preſens et à venir, dont la déciſion eſt pour l'ordinaire imperieuſe et ſans appel.—<bibl>

(one of the beſt among the late writers in that motley collection!) which was probably compoſed on the ſame ſtatue, and which I prefer to the two epigrams cited by Junius. It runs thus:

                  <p>There is a very pompous eulogy on the Bacchanal of Scopas in that ſingular little work, Deſcriptions of Fourteen Ancient Statues, in Greek proſe, by Calliſtratus. It is ſurpriſing that two ſuch ſcholars as Meur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius and Olearius could ſuppoſe theſe deſcriptions to be written by the very Calliſtratus whom Demoſthenes attended, with delight, as his maſter in eloquence. They rather ſeem the production of ſome trifling and declamatory ſophiſt, of a much later period. The deſcription of the Bacchanal cloſes, however, with a high compliment to the genius of Scopas; as it aſſerts that his ſculpture diſplayed that ſort of energy and ſpirit which characteriſed the orations of Demoſthenes. Olearius, who publiſhed Calliſtratus in his excellent edition of the two Philoſtrati, ſuppoſes this compariſon of the ſculptor with the orator to have been added to the original deſcription by ſome later hand. As it is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly

                  <p>This eminent artiſt, like his predeceſſor Phidias, and many of the Greeks, was doubly diſtinguiſhed as an architect and a ſculptor. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he was employed in both capacities on the magnificent tomb of Mauſolus, a work celebrated by many writers of antiquity as one of the ſeven wonders of the world, and ingeniouſly illuſtrated by M. de Caylus, in a diſſertation on its form and dimenſions, which the curious reader may find in the Memoirs of the French Academy. Five artiſts of diſtinction were engaged in this ſtupendous ſtructure, which roſe to the height of an hundred and forty feet, including what crowned the ſummit—a triumphal chariot of marble! The columns that ſurrounded the lower part of the fabric amounted to thirty-ſix, compriſing its four fronts. Thoſe to the ſouth and north were more extenſive than the other two. The eaſtern aſpect was aſſigned to the conduct of Scopas. The monument is doubly remarkable as a work of magnificent expenſe and of genuine affection. The fair ſovereign of Caria was ſo ſincere a mourner, that ſhe is ſaid to have died literally of grief for the loſt Mauſolus before his ſumptuous monument could be completed. She had, however, ſufficient energy of character to act as a heroine after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe; and Vitruvius records an anecdote of her proweſs which I am induced to mention, as it ſhews, in a very forcible light, the veneration paid by the ancients to the ſtatues erected under the auſpices of Victory.</p>
                  <p>The Rhodians, who were ſubject to Mauſolus, rebelled againſt his widow Artemiſia. The indignant queen, by a very bold ſtratagem, took poſſeſſion of their city, and raiſed in it, as a trophy of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,

two ſtatues of braſs; her own figure, and another repreſenting Rhodes ſubmitting to her authority.

                  <p>The glory that Praxiteles acquired from the excellence of his Venus was increaſed by the felicity with which he executed more than one ſtatue of Cupid. The orations of Cicero againſt Verres have given ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrity to the marble Cupid, which the orator repreſents as a rival to one ſtill more famous, by the ſame artiſt, that formed the pride and the wealth of the Theſpians—a ſtatue ſpared by Mummius, when he plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the cities of Greece. The rapacious Verres had robbed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and friendly Sicilian of a ſimilar exquiſite and invaluable work of art, which Cicero deſcribes as the production of Praxiteles. It is remarkable that the Roman orator ſpeaks with ſingular modeſty, on this occaſion, of his own knowledge as a connoiſſeur: <q>Marmoreum Praxitelis, (nimirum didici etiam, dum in iſtum inquiro, artificum nomina.</q>) The rapacity of the infamous governor had indeed amaſſed ſuch a collection of ſculpture, that an examination of his plunder was almoſt ſufficient to form a Roman connoiſſeur. The curious reader may find this collection agreeably illuſtrated in a Diſſertation by the Abbé Fraguier, inſerted in the Memoires of the French Academy, and intitled "The Gallery of Verres."</p>
                  <p>The happieſt of Cicero's repartees alluded to a ſtatue of this collection, a very valuable ſphinx of bronze, which formed a part of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

extortioner's Sicilian plunder. Verres had beſtowed it, as a retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fee, on his advocate, the celebrated orator Hortenſius, who had a ſtrong paſſion for works of art.

                  <p>To return to the Cupid of Praxiteles.—The ſculptor Falconet has cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured his countryman, M. de Jaucourt, for inſerting in the French En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyclopedia an anecdote relating to this celebrated ſtatue, told on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the preſident de Thou. The ſtory ſays that the March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioneſs of Mantua poſſeſſed, in the year 1573, the Cupid of Praxiteles, and the ſleeping Cupid of Michael Angelo; and that de Thou, with other gueſts of the Marchioneſs, were charmed with the work of the modern artiſt, till they compared it with a ſuperior work of antiquity that ſeemed to annihilate its merit. The ſtory is certainly improbable in many points of view; and Falconet exults in producing what he conſiders as a proof that the fact was impoſſible: I mean, the teſtimony of Pauſanias, declaring that the famous Cupid of Praxiteles, a ſtatue of marble, and the idol of the Theſpians, periſhed (after a variety of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures) in a fire at Rome. The evidence of Pauſanias ſufficiently proves, indeed, the fate of the Theſpian ſtatue, but it does not amount to a proof that it was impoſſible for the Marchioneſs of Mantua to poſſeſs a Cupid executed by Praxiteles; becauſe we have already ſeen that there exiſted two marble Cupids of acknowledged beauty, by this illuſtrious ſculptor; and among the ſtatues deſcribed by Calliſtratus, two Cupids, by the ſame artiſt, in bronze, are celebrated as works of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite

perfection. On one of theſe, perhaps, the following epigram was written; though Junius imagined that it was compoſed on the Theſpian Cupid, and that the poet had taken the liberty to turn the marble into braſs:</p>

The number of his works is a noble proof of his indefatigable
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0394000300:270"/>
application. They amounted to ſix hundred and ten, according to the moſt moderate of the two accounts that different copies of Pliny ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit. Even this number has rather a marvellous ſound: but the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing intelligent remarks of M. de Caylus, on this ſubject, are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſatisfy readers, not familiar with the proceſs of this admirable art, that the multitude of bronzes aſcribed to Lyſippus is far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the limits of credibility; though Pliny has mentioned them in ſuch terms as might produce, without the explanation of experience, only incredulous aſtoniſhment.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Le nombre des ouvrages des fondeurs en particulier, ſelon Pline, eſt inconcevable. On aſſure que le ſeul Lyſippe en fit ſix cens dix morceaux, qui tous auroient rendu célèbre celui qui n'en auroit fait qu'un-ſeul. Il fût aiſé de ſavoir leur nombre, car il avoit coûtume de mettre à part un denier d'or quand il en avoit produit un nouveau, et ſon heritier en fit le calcul après ſa mort.</p>
                     <p>Pline ne pouvoit rien dire de plus fort que d'ajoûter, ſur le detail de ces morceaux, 'Tantae omnia artis, ut claritatem poſſent dare vel ſingula.'</p>
                     <p>C'eſt preſenter, ce me ſemble, avec trop d'apparat la choſe la plus ſimple, et dont le détail méritoit le moins d'être rélevé heureuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment la ſeule pratique de l'art peut nous en donner l'intelligence, et même ſans faire tort au mérite de Lyſippe, en faveur de qui tout le monde eſt prévenu, par les eloges de l'antiquité, et par l'approbation et le choix d'Alexandre le Grand, dont il étoit contemporain. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant l'explication de ce paſſage me paroit néceſſaire pour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilier toutes les idées; d'autant que ceux qui voudroient s'en tenir au texte ſimple croiroient ne devoir en rien rabattre, puiſque les preuves de fait ſont jointes à une deſcription qui tient non ſeulement du merveilleux, mais qui répond aux grandes idées que l'on a des an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens; perſonne ne les admet plus que moi, mais elles demandent
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0394000300:271"/>
des diſtinctions. D'un autre côté les artiſtes et les amateurs des arts commenceroient par réjeter fort loin le fait, et ils le regarderoient comme impoſſible; car il faut convenir que Pline paroit, au premier abord, s'être mis ici dans le danger de ceux qui veulent trop prouver.</p>
                     <p>S'il étoit queſtion, dans ce calcul, des ouvrages de Lyſippe des ſtatues de marbre, et même de figures de bronze de grandeur natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relle, ou faites chacune ſur différens modèles (quoiqu'il en ait produit pluſieurs de ce genre) le nombre de ſix cens dix morceaux de la main d'un ſeul artiſte, ne ſeroit ni poſſible, ni vrai-ſemblable; la connoiſſance des arts, et leur marche dans l'exécution, vont heureuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſervir à lever tous nos doutes.</p>
                     <p>Quand la pratique de la fonte eſt familière à un artiſt, et qu'il a ſous ſes ordres des gens capables de l'aider, les ouvrages ſe multiplient en peu de tems: l'artiſte n'a proprement beſoin que de faire des mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dèles en terre ou en cire, manoeuvre que l'on ſait être auſſi prompte que facile. Le moule, la fonte et le ſoin de réparer, ſont des opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions qui ne demandent point la main du maître; et cependant la figure n'eſt pas moins regardée comme ſon ouvrage. Ajoûtons à ces facilités que l'on peut jeter un très-grande nombre de figures dans le même moule, et ſans doute que toutes les fois qu'il en ſortoit une de ſon fourneau, Lyſippe s'étoit impoſé la loi de mettre à part un denier d'or, dont le nombre accumulé ſervit après ſa mort à ſupputer la quantité de figures fondues dans ſon attelier. Il n'eût pas été dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficile à Jean de Boulogne d'en faire autant de nos jours; et peut-être que ſi l'on comptoit le nombre de petites figures qu'il a produites de cette façon, on n'en trouveroit guère moins de ſix cens dix, indé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendamment des grandes figures équeſtres, et des autres ſtatues ou bas-réliefs dont il a fait les modèles, et à la fonte deſquels il a préſidé.</p>

                  <p>Rome poſſeſſed another work of Lyſippus particularly memorable, as it diſcovers the lively intereſt which the Roman people took in theſe Grecian ornaments of their city. The ſtatue I allude to repreſented a man rubbing himſelf after the uſe of the bath. It had been ſtationed, with the uſual ſolemnities, before the baths of Agrippa: but as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to delight the fancy of Tiberius, that ſubtle and cautious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was raſh enough to remove it to his own chamber.

the manners and the feelings of the ancient world.

                        <q>Hominis autem imaginem gypſo e facie ipſâ primus omnium expreſſit, cerâque in eam formam gypſi infuſâ emendare inſtituit Lyſiſtratus Sicyonius frater Lyſippi, de quo diximus. Sic et ſimilitudinem reddere inſtituit: ante eum quam pulcherrimas facere ſtudebant. Idem et de ſignis effigiem exprimere invenit. Crevitque res in tantum utnulla ſigna <hi>ſtatuae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve ſine argilla</hi> fierent.</q> Quo apparet antiquiorem hanc fuiſſe ſcientiam quam fundendi aeris. Lib. xxxv. c. 12.—So ſtood the paſſage till the Paris editor of Pliny in twelve quartos made the following alteration: "ut nulla ſigna ſuâ ſine argillâ fierent." By changing the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous word <hi>ſtatuaeve</hi> into <hi>ſuâ,</hi> he hoped to rectify the weakneſs of the paſſage: but I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend another very ſlight alteration may improve it much more. Inſtead of <hi>ſine agilla,</hi> I would read <hi>ſine arte illâ</hi> conſidering thoſe words as expreſſing the invention of Lyſiſtratus, and giving a little better ſenſe to the cloſe of the paſſage, <q>antiquiorem hanc fuiſſe ſcientiam, quam fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi aeris;</q> which may then ſignify that this practice of caſting the real features in plaiſter was prior to the formation of perfect portraits in bronze.</note>.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen it ſomewhere obſerved, that a ſtatue, reſembling the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive Hercules of Lyſippus, was formerly in the poſſeſſion of the celebrated Pithou, who has been called the Varro of France: but I apprehend that intereſting work of ancient art has long ceaſed to exiſt; and as the animated poem, in which Statius has deſcribed the ſtatue and its moſt amiable poſſeſſor, has not appeared (to my recollection) in our language, I ſhall conclude this note with an entire verſion of the Latin epiſtle I allude to, as the moſt pleaſing tribute that antiquity has paid to the talents of Lyſippus.</p>

                  <p>M. de Caylus cloſes one of his Diſcourſes on the Sculpture of the Ancients, in the Memoirs of the French Academy, with a circumſtantial account of the Rhodian Coloſſus, collected from the authors of remote and recent times who have occaſionally mentioned this moſt magnificent of all coloſſal figures, the memorable production of a little iſland once ennobled by the united influence of liberty, art, and naval power! Yet, after the reſearches of an accompliſhed writer, on a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo attractive to his fancy, we muſt ſtill remain in ignorance of ſome particulars relating to this intereſting image, that a lover of the arts would be glad to aſcertain. Much, however, is known. Pliny has deſcribed the fragments of this Coloſſus in clear and animated lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <q>Ante onines autem in admiratione ſuit Solis Coloſſus Rhodi, quem fecerat Chares Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dins, Lyſippi ſupra dicti diſcipulus.

Pauci pollicem ejus amplectuntur. Majores ſunt digiti quam pleraeque ſtatuae. Vaſti ſpecus hiant defractis membris, ſpectantur intus magnae molis ſaxa, quorum pondere ſtabiliverat conſtituens.

                     </note>. The Greek epigram, containing its dimenſions, varies (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to different readings) from ſeventy to eighty cubits. M. de Caylus, forming his calculation from the expreſſion of Pliny, that few men could embrace the thumb, concludes that the height of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtatue was about an hundred and five feet.</p>

                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0394000300:287"/>We learn from Strabo that it was broken aſunder at the knees, and that the Rhodians conſidered themſelves as prohibited by an oracle from replacing it. They probably guarded the fragments with a religious veneration. I know not otherwiſe how to account for a very ſurpriſing fact, which my deceaſed friend Gibbon has recorded with his uſual elegance and energy of expreſſion. He obſerves, that <q>after ſtanding fifty-ſix years, the Coloſſus of Rhodes was overthrown by an earthquake: but the maſſy trunk and huge fragments lay ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered eight centuries on the ground.</q> I cannot tranſcribe the words of an accompliſhed author, whoſe memory is ſo juſtly dear to me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflecting, with poignant regret, what infinite advantages, for the improvement of my preſent work, I might have derived from his taſte, knowledge, and kindneſs, had his life been extended according to my wiſhes. Gibbon, though he was not a collector of ſtatues or pictures, had a lively eſteem for all the fine arts.</p>

The Saracen chief, who invaded Rhodes in the year 672, ſeized and tranſported this ponderous plunder into Syria, where it was publicly ſold to a Jew of Edeſſa. The ſtory of loading nine hundred camels with the weight of theſe ſtupendous relies has the air of an Arabian tale. M. de Caylus imagines that modern writers have fallen into a great miſtake concerning the attitude and the ſtation of the ſtanding Coloſſus, by repreſenting it as a ſtriding figure at the entrance of the port, as the reader may have ſeen it in ordinary prints, with veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels failing between its legs. This intelligent writer rather ſuppoſes it to have been placed on the ſhore, upon a ſingle triangular baſis of white marble. He ſays that no ancient author, no ancient monument, is

                  <p>Ptolemy was ſo fond of the arts and of his queen, that he is ſaid to have projected a temple to her memory, ſo vaulted with loadſtone, as to keep a metallic ſtatue of Arſinoe ſuſpended in the air; a project which the death of his famous architect Dimocrates is ſuppoſed to have defeated! Arſinoe happened to ſuffer, in a ſingular manner, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of her huſband's paſſion for ſculpture. In marrying his daughter to Antiochus king of Syria, Ptolemy had affectionately conducted the bride to Seleucia; and being charmed by a magnificent ſtatue of Diana, he received it as a preſent from his ſon-in-law, and tranſported it to Alexandria: but Arſinoe falling ſick on its arrival, ſaw, in her troubled dreams, the offended goddeſs, who complained of being removed from her Syrian temple. Ptolemy had tenderneſs ſufficient to calm the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed fancy of his queen, by ſending back the favourite ſtatue, but had not the reward he deſerved for his humanity—the delight of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the health of his Arſinoe.</p>
                  <p>Winkelmann, in ſpeaking of the arts at the court of Seleucia, aſſerts that the Grecian ſculptors who migrated into Aſia ſurpaſſed, in their works, ſuch of their brethren as remained in their own country; and he quotes the laſt character of Theophraſtus in proof of this aſſertion. In conſulting the character referred to, I find nothing that can relate to works of art: but in a character very near the laſt, (the 23d, on Oſtentation,) I find a paſſage which, if it proves any thing, may be thought rather to prove the reverſe of what the learned hiſtorian of art has, in this inſtance, advanced with an inaccuracy very pardonable in an animated writer, whoſe reſearches were ſo extenſive, and whoſe general merits are ſo great. Theophraſtus makes his man of oſtentation, who boaſts of his campaigns with Alexander, contend that the artiſts in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0394000300:293"/>
Aſia are ſuperior to thoſe in Europe; whence we may reaſonably infer not that they really were ſo, but that Theophraſtus rather thought the contrary. The paſſage, however, alludes not to ſtatues, but to goblets and gems<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>Whether we contemplate the excellence or the number of ancient ſtatues that have been wonderfully recovered in the three laſt centuries, our obligations to Time, as a preſerver, are ſuch as may juſtly excite aſtoniſhment and gratitude. Had he reſtored only the Laocoon, the Apollo of the Belvedere, and the Medicaean Venus, a lover of the arts might conſider his kindneſs in the department of ſculpture, as equivalent to his literary beneficence in preſerving the compoſitions of Demoſthenes, Plato, and Homer. The liberality of Time, as a reſtorer, will appear in the ſtrongeſt point of view, if we contraſt what Poggio ſaid of the ſtatues in Rome, in the fifteenth century, and what the Abbé Guaſco
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0394000300:294"/>
wrote to his brother, on the ſame ſubject, about fifty years ago. I will tranſcribe the two paſſages I allude to; obſerving that the teſtimony of Poggio is the more to be depended on, as he was particularly fond of ancient ſculpture. His delight in collecting fragments of antiquity is recorded by the accompliſhed hiſtorian of Lorenzo de Medici.—Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coe, vol. ii. p. 196.</p>

                  <p>It is a ſuppoſition of Winkelmann, that the Rhodian ſculptor Ageſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der executed himſelf the figure of Laocoon, and Ageſander's two ſons, Athenodorus and Polydorus, the two younger figures of the group: an idea ſo pleaſing, that the fancy and the heart are both willing to embrace it.</p>
                  <p>Felix de Fredis, a Roman citizen, had the good fortune to diſcover the Laocoon, and to receive from pope Julius the Second an eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal penſion for his diſcovery. Leo the Tenth exonerated the revenues of the church from this penſion, and gave to Fredis in exchange the poſt of apoſtolical ſecretary, in the year 1517. The raiſing of this, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work of art from its grave might form, perhaps, a very intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hiſtorical picture; as ſome eminent perſonages might be introduced as ſpectators of the ſcene.

The daily contemplation of very fine ſculpture, that expreſſed, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt powers of art, great elevation of mind, would probably have a ſtrong and happy influence on mental character.</p>
                  <p>The legs of this celebrated Hercules were wanting, when the ſtatue was firſt diſcovered. The following anecdote concerning them is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Bottari, in one of his notes to Vaſari's Life of Michel Angelo:</p>

But the laborious painter of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, who publiſhed ſuch extenſive, well-intended, yet very imperfect works upon Art, might very innocently call a noble veteran of ninety blind, without meaning more than ſuch infirmity of viſion as naturally belongs to that age.

                  <p>Dempſter, who has laboured with admirable zeal and erudition to revive the honour of Etruria, contends very ſtrenuouſly for the invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive genius of the Etruſcans.

<q>The pomp and circumſtance of glorious war;</q>
and particularly the ſolemnities of triumphal magnificence.</p>
                  <p>This early and zealous advocate for the glory of Etruria is angry with Strabo for having imagined that the Romans had borrowed ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities from the Greeks: <q>Videtur Strabo triumphandi apparatum ad Romanos quidem a Tuſcis veniſſe ſignificare, ſed et illos a Graecis hauſiſſe: quod non poteſt mirum videri in Graeculo, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſius

                  <p>"En paſſant en Etrurie," ſays the Abbé Guaſco in ſpeaking of ſtatues raiſed in honour of public characters, <q>nous trouverions que les anciens fondateurs ou legiſlateurs de cette nation, obtinrent dans ce pays les mêmes honneurs que les Grecs accorderent à leurs héros. On y voyoit le ſimulacre d'Haleſus, le premier qui porta dans ces contrées les myſteres de Junon, qui fonda quelques villes, et que l'inſcription en caractère Etruſque, qu'on liſoit aux pieds de ſa ſtatue, diſoit fils de Neptune et deſcendu des Veiens......

                  <p>I apprehend the learned Abbé has led me to confound two different heroes of the ſame title. This is not the Haleſus who makes a much more graceful figure as a warrior in the poetry of Virgil, than his nameſake does in the ancient ſculpture of his Etruſcan cotemporaries,— according to the engraving of his image, which I find in the Firſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of Gori's "Muſeum Etruſcum."</p>

                  <p>I ought not to quit Etruria without obſerving, that many laudable efforts have been made to reſcue and elucidate the almoſt annihilated reliques of this unfortunate nation, by ſeveral authors of indefatigable induſtry and refined erudition. Much may be learned from Dempſter, Gori, and the ſenator Buonarotti: ſtill more from the various Latin diſſertations of Paſſeri, and the Saggio di Lingua Etruſca Dall Abate Lauzi. The latter has added to his deep reſearches into the language of Etruria a very pleaſing little Treatiſe, <q>Circa la Scoltura degli Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi e i varii ſuoi Stili.</q> On that of Etruria he obſerves: <q>Direb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſi che il diſegno Etruſco nelle figure ſi conforma con quello della lot loro architettura—l'ordine Toſcanico è il piu forte di tutti, ma il meno gentile.</q>

                  <p>Nothing could exceed the inaptitude of the Romans to excell in the art of ſculpture, except the rapacity with which they ſeized the ſtatues of the various nations who ſurpaſſed them in ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>Their public ravages of this kind were often followed by petty acts of barbariſm and baſeneſs ſtill more deteſtable; for, not contented with having carried off the monuments of public merit from the countries they overcame, they eraſed inſcriptions from the ſtatues of illuſtrious men, and inſerted falſe titles of their own. On this occaſion it is juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to exclaim with Cicero, "Odi falſas inſcriptiones ſtatuarum aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum."</p>
                  <p>The learned Figrelius, who has written at length on the ſtatues of the Romans, relates ſome curious examples of this ſculptural forgery. It appears, from the authority of Dio Chryſoſtom, that Alcibiades was turned into Aenobarbus; and according to Zonaras, even Conſtantine the Great did not ſcruple to put his own name on a ſtatue of Apollo: but if he did ſo, we may hope it was rather to annihilate the worſhip he condemned, than to impoſe the figure of a Pagan divinity on the people as the real repreſentative of a Chriſtian emperor.</p>
                  <p>In juſtice to the Romans it is proper to remark, that they might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly learn from the Greeks themſelves the diſingenuous practice of falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ſtatues of ancient worthies. We know that Rhodes (one of the moſt magnificent marts of ſculpture in the Pagan world!) incurred conſiderable diſgrace by this ſpecies of falſehood, for which Dio Chryſoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom reproves the Rhodians in a very copious, animated, and beautiful

                  <q>Tam prolixa oratione hoc unum agit; ut Rhodiorum ſenatui ac populo morem diſſuadeat, qui apud eos obtinuerat, ſtatuas veteres transferendi ad aliorum honorem titulis mutatis, ſurdo figurarum diſcrimine.

                  <p>There is another oration of Dio relating to ſculpture, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly entertaining. The orator with great dexterity expreſſes his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, to the inhabitants of Corinth, that a brazen ſtatue of himſelf, with which they had honoured him on his former viſit, (about eleven years before,) had vaniſhed from their city—a ſubject of great delicacy, and very gracefully treated, particularly in the cloſe of the oration.</p>

The nature of thoſe ſpoils, and the future conſequences of ſuch conduct, are finely deſcribed in the following words of Livy:</p>

                  <p>The triumphant ſplendor of ancient Rome ſeems to have dazzled even the philoſophical ſpirits of antiquity, and to have ſtruck them blind to the predominant vices of her national character. Theſe were arrogance and rapacity; vices generally ſtigmatized when they appear in an individual, and certainly not deſerving a cenſure leſs ſevere when
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0394000300:310"/>
they form the characteriſtics of a nation. Yet ſo faſcinating is the pride of ſucceſsful valour, that the nation of antiquity moſt injurious in its conduct towards the reſt of the world is often commended as an object for modern emulation. The moſt flagrant enormities of which the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of France (both regal and republican) have been guilty, ſeem to have been greatly owing to an indiſcriminate and fantaſtic imitation of Roman ſpirit; with a prepoſterous paſſion, ſometimes concealed, and ſometimes avowed, for univerſal dominion. The French appear to believe the Romans to have been what they ſuppoſed themſelves to be— a divine race of men, deſtined by ſuperior virtue to ſubdue the other nations of the earth; or, to uſe the words of their elegant but ſervile flatterer Virgil:

                  <p>A Latin author, of an age not ſo poliſhed, the Chriſtian philoſopher Arnobius, who wrote with the indignant warmth of an African, has drawn, in the oppoſite point of view, a forcible and faithful picture of the Romans, in the queſtions with which he concludes his animated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective, "Adverſus Gentes."</p>
                  <q>Generis earn fuiſſe divini quiſquamne hominum credat, aut ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buiſſe aequitatem diis dignam, quae humanis ſeſe diſcordiis inſerens aliorum opes fregit, aliis ſe praebuit exhibuitque fautricem: liberta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem his abſtulit, alios ad columen dominationis erexit: quae ut una civitas emineret, in humani generis perniciem nata, orbem ſubjugavit innoxium.</q>
                  <p>Theſe prominent features in the national character of Rome are painted alſo, with great fidelity and ſpirit, by Monteſquieu, in his maſterly ſketch of her grandeur and decline; particularly in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0394000300:311"/>
entitled, <q>De la Conduite que les Romains tinrent pour ſoumettre tous les peuples.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the ſublimeſt cenſure on the national conduct of Rome is that which Milton has paſſed upon it, in his Paradiſe Regained; where, to exhibit her ambition in the moſt execrable point of view, he makes the Arch-fiend propoſe it as a model, in one of his inſidious ſpeeches to our Saviour,

                  <p>The Abbé Guaſco has well deſcribed the deep and lively intereſt that the Grecians took in the perfection of art, and in the honour of its profeſſors:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>L'autorité publique prenoit un intérêt très ſerieux à la perfection de l'art. A'Thebes ainſi qu'à Athenes il y avoit des loix tendant à proteger, et encourager les profeſſeurs, et des loix pénales et pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaires pour ceux qui faiſoient de mauvais ouvrages; elles défendoient même de s'occuper d'objets difformes ou communs.</p>
                     <p>La conſideration et les diſtinctions qu'on accordoit aux artiſtes dans la Grèce, étoient très-propres à les encourager; loin d'être regardés comme des mercénaires à gage et des ſimples ouvriers, on les con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidéroit comme des hommes diſtingués, comme des eſprits ſublimes donés d'un génie divin, enrichis per l'étude, et polis par l'uſage du monde, ils étoient mis au niveau des philoſophes et des premiers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages de l'état, parvenant à ſes premiers emplois, et partageant dans les faſtes de la patrie l'immortalité qu'ils donnoient aux hommes illuſtres; il n'étoit pas extraordinaire de voir leur ſtatues à côtè de celles des heros et des rois.—</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Greeks indeed in general paid ſuch honours very juſtly to their ſublime artiſts: but the Grecian philoſophers ſeem to have looked upon them with a very jealous (not to ſay an evil) eye. Even Plato and Plutarch have occaſionally ſpoken of artiſts with a ſort of envious diſreſpect that is particularly unbecoming in men of ſuch cultivated minds. Theſe two enlightened and benevolent philoſophers might have reflected that an accompliſhed ſculptor, whoſe art is properly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0394000300:315"/>
may be conſidered like themſelves as the true ſervant of moral philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>A nation can hardly honour too highly the ſucceſsful profeſſors of any refined and arduous art, whoſe productions have an evident and graceful tendency to give elevation and dignity to national character: ſince, as Cicero ſays, very nobly in his Oration pro Muraena, <q>Omnes enim artes quae nobis populi ſtudia conciliant, et admirabilem dignitatem, et pergratam utilitatem debent habere. Summa dignitas eſt in iis qui militari laude antecellunt: omnia enim quae ſunt in imperio, et in ſtatu civitatis ab iis defendi et firmari putantur; ſumma etiam utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus: ſiquidem eorum conſilio et periculo, cum republica, tum etiam noſtris rebus perfrui poſſumus.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The true intereſt, honour, and laſting proſperity of a ſtate ſeems to depend, in great meaſure, on preſerving a due balance and reciprocal reſpect between arts and arms; for wherever too ſtrong a predilection for either prevails, that very predilection (though it produces a blaze of ſucceſs in a ſingle path of celebrity) becomes a certain, yet unſuſpected ſource of future deſtruction.

There is a paſſage,

towards the end of this Treatiſe, which paints the Romans, in very juſt and ſtrong colours, as the plunderers of the world:</p>

                  <p>Herodes Atticus, the munificent citizen of Athens, was the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed ſon of a moſt fortunate father;—a father, who had not only the rare good fortune to diſcover, and obtain permiſſion from the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Nerva to appropriate to his own family a concealed and inexhauſtible treaſure, but the higher good fortune to find, and ſucceſsfully cultivate, in his child, thoſe talents and virtues which, inſtead of being corrupted by unbounded opulence, rather appeared to derive from it new energy and luſtre. Herodes Atticus became not only the richeſt ſubject in the Roman empire, but he was at the ſame time one of the moſt ſtudious, the moſt eloquent, and liberal of men. It was his noble maxim, that the wealthy ought to employ their riches, not only in relieving the neceſſities of the poor, but in ſaving thoſe of narrow circumſtances from ſinking into poverty. Pauſanias, who lived at the ſame period, has ſpoken with pleaſure of the magnificent gifts beſtowed by this generous Athenian on different parts of Greece. The moſt remarkable were, the Stadium that he formed at Athens, of the fineſt marble, extending ſix hundred feet; and ſtatues of ſingular beauty and ſplendor, with which he decorated the temple of Neptune, on the Iſthmus of Corinth. The Abbé Guaſco, without mentioning his authority, aſſerts that this accompliſhed Athenian practiſed the art of ſculpture himſelf:</p>
                  <q>Le celèbre Hérode, ſurnomme l'Attique, ne crut pas ſe degrader en maniant lui-même le ciſeau; et la Venus armée, dont il fut l'au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teur, fait connoitre qu'il honoroit autant la ſculpture par le bon gout de ſes productions, que par la dignité de ſa perſonne.</q>

Its merit as a ſtatue may be conceived from the following words of Damaſcius, preſerved in Photius:</p>

                  <p>I cannot quit this memorable perſonage without obſerving, with pleaſure, that after having obtained conſular diſtinction at Rome, and enjoyed the friendſhip of a virtuous Roman emperor, he ended his days, in a good old age, (ſeventy-ſix,) at his favourite villa, the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious ſpot of Marathon, where he meant to be privately buried: but the affection of the Athenians, who regarded him as a father, took the body from his domeſtics, and conveyed it, with the moſt honourable ſolemnity, to one of the public ſtructures with which his munificence had decorated their city.</p>

Pour ſe former une idée de l'immenſité de cette conſtruction, il faut ſe repré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter qu'elle renfermoit preſque toute une ville, des temples, des pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtres, et une infinité d'autres édifices, entre autres deux théatres, dont l'un peut nous donner la meilleure notion de tous les edifices de ce genre. C'eſt le théatre le plus entier qui nous ſoit reſté des anciens: on y voit encore le portique, les ſalles des acteurs, les eſcaliers par où l'on montoit au théatre, la porte de la ſcene, les portiques latéraux de l'avant ſcene, l'orcheſtre et la place des inſtrumens. Ce prince avoit imité dans ce palais tout ce que l'antiquité avoit en de plus celebre: le Lycée, l'Académie, le Prytanée, le Portique, le Temple de Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, et le Pécile d'Athene, il y avoit même fait repréſenter les Champs Elyſées, et le royaume de Pluton.....Les ſtatues qu'on a tirées des fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles de cette maiſon depuis deux cent cinquante ans, ont enrichi tous les cabinets de l'Europe, et il y reſte encore des decouvertes à faire pour nos derniers neveux.</q>
                  <p>It is thus that Winkelmann (in the Tranſlation of Huber) ſpeaks of this imperial villa, that ſeems to have ſurpaſſed the ſplendor of Aſiatic magnificence. The liberality of Hadrian to the reviving cities of Greece, and particularly to Athens, is recorded by Pauſanias, and forcibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the two following verſes that were engraved in the Acropolis:

                     <hi>NOTE II. Ver. 38.</hi> While Mercy bleſt thee as her dear ally.</head>
                  <p>A temple (perhaps rather an altar) in Athens, dedicated to Mercy by the deſcendants of Hercules, is ſaid to have been the firſt Aſylum. To this the poet Claudian alludes:
<q>
                        <l>— Flentibus aram,</l>
                        <l>Et proprium miſeris numen ſtatuiſtis Athenae.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Aſylum that Romulus eſtabliſhed in his new city is deſcribed in the Second Book of Dionyſius Halicarnaſſenſis. Ovid thus ſpeaks of it in his Faſti:
<q>
                        <l>Romulus ut ſaxo lucum circumdedit alto;</l>
                        <l>Cuilibet, Huc, inquit, confuge, tutus eris.</l>
                        <bibl>FAST. iii. 431.</bibl>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The privileges and the abuſes of the ancient Aſyla, in different countries, have probably been well illuſtrated by the Abbé Guaſco, in a Treatiſe which he wrote expreſsly on this intereſting ſubject; a book that I have ſought for, without being ſo fortunate as to meet with it.</p>

                  <p>Diogenes Laertius aſſerts, in his Life of Socrates, that the Athenians immediately repented their conduct towards the philoſopher, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured his memory by a public ſtatue of braſs, the work of Lyſippus! It is remarkable that two men, one eſteemed the wiſeſt, and the other the wittieſt of the Greeks, Socrates and Lucian, were bred to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſculpture. The vivacity of Lucian, and his antipathy to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere relation, his maſter, probably precluded that comic genius from making any conſiderable advances in an art which requires the ſteadieſt union of induſtry and talent. But Socrates is known to have executed ſome works, as a ſtatuary, that were objects of public regard. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias has noticed the Graces, in the Acropolis of Athens, as the work of the philoſopher; and in obſerving that theſe and the elder Golden Graces of Bupalus were not deſtitute of drapery, he profeſſes himſelf unable to diſcover what artiſt introduced the cuſtom, prevalent in his time, of repreſenting the Graces naked. Falconet imagines that ſtatues executed by Socrates could have but a trifling degree of merit as works of art, from the philoſopher's having quitted the profeſſion very early in life: but the more candid Greeks ſeem inclined to applaud the laudable endeavours of juvenile talent; and a Greek epigram on a very young ſculptor, Eutychides, ſpeaks of him as equal to Praxiteles, though cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitouſly hurried out of life at the age of ſixteen:

                  <p>Thoſe who are amuſed by obſerving the oppoſite extremes into which prejudice and partiality are apt to be hurried in deſcribing the ſame author, may be gratified in comparing what the French ſculptor Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conet, and his countryman M. de la Nauze, have ſaid, one to depreciate, and the other to magnify, the merits of Pliny as a writer upon art. Perhaps the ſpirit of that indefatigable and illuſtrious Roman, if we could queſtion him on the ſubject, would equally ſmile at the bitter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and the exaggerated praiſe, confeſſing ingenuouſly that he really deſerved neither the one nor the other. In his great and unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed work it is certainly not difficult to find ſome conſiderable imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; yet taken altogether it is a moſt valuable and glorious monument of induſtry, intelligence, and good-nature.</p>

                  <p>The Latin folio of Francis Junius De Pictura Veterum is a work of extenſive erudition, and equal philanthropy. The very ſtudious and amiable author was born in the Palatinate, 1599: he firſt embraced the profeſſion of arms, but ſoon quitted it on the eſtabliſhment of peace; and after travelling to France, he viſited England, and reſided for thirty years in the family of that illuſtrious lover of art, the celebrated earl of Arundel; a circumſtance peculiarly favourable to his elaborate produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt edition of it was printed in Holland; but the ſecond, with many additions, and a life of the author by Graevius, was publiſhed in London, 1694.</p>
                  <p>A letter from Grotius, dated Paris, 1638, in returning thanks to Junius for a copy of his book, contains the following judicious and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant deſcription of its merit:</p>

                  <p>Junius died at Windſor, in the houſe of his nephew Voſſius: and the univerſity of Oxford, to whom this moſt mild and laborious ſcholar bequeathed his books, has honoured his memory with an epitaph that contains the following very pleaſing eulogy:

                  <p>Though the eager enthuſiaſtic ſpirit of Winkelman expoſed him oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally to deluſion and to ridicule, there is ſuch a portion of ſolid and of ſplendid merit in his great work, the Hiſtory of Art, as can hardly fail to confer upon its author an honourable immortality. The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and the failings of this animated writer are candidly diſplayed in the eulogy inſcribed to him by his accompliſhed friend Heyne, the profeſſor of Gottingen. In the copious tide of tranſlations from the German which has recently enriched the literature of our country, it is matter of ſurpriſe and regret to thoſe who delight in the arts, that the works of Winkelman have not yet made their appearance. He has found creditable tranſlators both in France and Italy. Time will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably produce a collection of all his different works on deſign, in a becoming Engliſh dreſs, with a ſuitable account of a writer whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions

He was born at Stendal in Brandenburgh, 1717; and ſtabbed at Trieſte by an itinerant Italian, who vainly hoped to rob him of ſome valuable metals that he had received as a preſent on his viſit to the court of Vienna.</p>
                  <p>Winkelman, notwithſtanding the many wounds he received, lived long enough to forgive his aſſaſſin, and to bequeath his property to his illuſtrious friend and patron cardinal Alexander Albani.</p>

                  <p>The delight and advantages ariſing from a lively and liberal paſſion for the fine arts were never more forcibly exemplified than in the youthful, and in the declining days, of that accompliſhed nobleman the Comte de Caylus. Born of a very illuſtrious family in 1692, he began his career of public life as a ſoldier; but on the peace of Raſtadt, he amuſed his active ſpirit by travelling to Italy. In the courſe of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion, he made a frank offer of his ſword in defence of Malta, then threatened by the Turks: the alarm of that iſland paſſed away, and the count returned to Paris. The love of travelling, and a paſſionate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the ſtudy of antiquities, now induced him to relinquiſh his military profeſſion. He wiſhed to viſit the ſcenes of ancient art, and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0394000300:353"/>
ſeized the opportunity of embarking for the eaſt with a new embaſſador from his country to Conſtantinople. As they ſtopt at Smyrna, he was eager to ſurvey the ruins of Epheſus; their diſtance from Smyrna was only the journey of a day. His friends endeavoured to diſſuade him from attempting it, by diſplaying the danger he muſt incur, as the country was infeſted by a mercileſs banditti, under a formidable chief, Caracayali.</p>
                  <p>But in the Comte de Caylus (ſays his Eulogiſt) fear was always ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to deſire. He accompliſhed his wiſhes by an adventurous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: clothing himſelf in a ſimple linen dreſs, and taking with him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could tempt rapacity, he ſet forth with two of the banditti, who were ſuffered, from motives of public apprehenſion, to viſit Smyrna occaſionally. He had made a bargain with theſe men, on a promiſe of paying them liberally on his ſafe return. They conducted him, with an interpreter, to their captain. Caracayali, pleaſed with his animated viſitor, took a pleaſure in gratifying his curioſity. He told him there were ruins ſtill nearer, that deſerved his attention; and to convey him thither with the utmoſt celerity, he ſupplied him with two of the fineſt Arabian courſers. The Comte ſeemed to be tranſported by magic to the intereſting ſpot: it preſented to him the ruins of Colopton. After enjoying that unexpected and delightful ſcene, he returned to paſs the night in a fort that formed the reſidence of Caracayali; and the next day he devoted to the ruins of Epheſus. Of the ſtate in which he found the famous temple of Diana, he has left a memoir: but the nature of my preſent work does not allow me to dwell on the extended life and numerous productions of this engaging character: I haſten to ſpeak of his latter days. After returning to France, and viſiting Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don more than once; after paſſing many years in active, though ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life, in various compoſitions, particularly his Academical Memoirs on different Branches of Painting and Sculpture, and his very compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive

He triumphed for ſome time over the corporeal miſeries of decaying nature, by the exertions of an active, enlightened, and affectionate ſpirit:—"Il viſita," (ſays his eloquent eulogiſt M. le Beau, from whom I have drawn this brief account of his intereſting hero,) <q>il viſita ſes amis, les ſçavans, les artiſtes, dont il alloit animer les travaux, tandis qu'il mouroit lui-même.....

Yet under theſe ſevere diſadvantages he executed ſome original deſigns that are thought, by leſs partial judges, to promiſe great future excellence, if Heaven graciouſly reſtores him from a ſtate of the moſt calamitous and complicated ſufferings, which he has now ſupported, for more

My reader has an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of judging if I ſpeak too partially of the deſigns executed by this dear invalid, as the Death of Demoſthenes (which he drew, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining himſelf on the couch of pain, for the affectionate purpoſe of decorating this Poem) is one of thoſe I allude to.
