            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>I. I begin with the firſt, <hi>The ſeveral Orders,</hi> &amp;c. where it may be needful (1) to ſhew that there was a <hi>Diſparity</hi> in theſe Orders, as to their Office, and a <hi>Subordination</hi> in their Miniſtery. (2) To conſider what they were, wherein they differ'd, and what were the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>Employments</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> of each Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and (3) to reflect upon the Goodneſs and Providence of God, by which they have all been continued down to the preſent time, and eſtabliſh'd in this our Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there was a <hi>Subordination</hi> in the Office of the ſeveral Orders in the Chriſtian Church. Now this appears from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Reaſoning</hi> and <hi>Alluſions,</hi> both here, and in the other Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> At the 4th Verſe of this Chapter he tells the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1082102400:5"/>
that the Church of Chriſt is <hi>one Body,</hi> that <hi>there is one Spirit, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, and one God and Father of all;</hi> and yet he adds at the 7th verſe, <hi>But unto every one of us is given Grace, according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> i. e. agreeably to the true meaning of the Original word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this and other places, to every one of us is given his <hi>Office</hi> or employment in the Church, different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different gifts, which it has pleaſed our Lord to beſtow upon us.</p>
               <p>And this he exemplifies in the following Verſe, by repreſenting our Saviour diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe Gifts, as <hi>Conquerors</hi> uſed to do, when they made triumphal Entries into their Capital Cities, after ſome notable Victories over their Enemies; when we know it was uſual to diſperſe among the People <hi>Medals</hi> of different Bigneſs and different Metal, and other <hi>Gifts,</hi> ſome of greater and ſome of leſſer price. Thus our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> when he had conquered Satan and Sin, and Hell and Death, and made his Triumphant Entry into Heaven, diſtributed the different Gifts of his holy Spirit, in ſuch <hi>kinds</hi> and ſuch <hi>proportions</hi> as the Perſons and Offices required to which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1082102400:6"/>
they were conveyed. v. 8. <hi>Wherefore he ſaith when he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men,</hi> ſome <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> ſome <hi>Prophets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But leaſt the <hi>Subordination</hi> of the different Orders ſhould not ſufficiently appear from this <hi>diſparity</hi> of their Gifts, our Apoſtle ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it yet more evident 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them to the ſeveral parts of the Body of man; where he not only tells us at the 4. v. &amp;c. that <hi>there are diverſities of Gifts, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Adminiſtrations</hi> and <hi>diverſities of Operations;</hi> but that theſe have a <hi>relation</hi> to, and a <hi>dependance</hi> upon one another, as the <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Hands,</hi> and <hi>Feet</hi> have in mans Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, v. 12. <hi>For as the Body is one and hath many Members, and all the Members of that one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, being many, are one Body, ſo alſo is Chriſt,</hi> that is, in his Body the Church. Now we know in our Bodies, the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet,</hi> &amp;c. are not only <hi>different,</hi> but <hi>ſubordinate;</hi> the Feet muſt walk by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the <hi>Eye</hi> and the Hands act at the command of the <hi>Head,</hi> otherwiſe the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be <hi>diſorderly,</hi> and the whole Body muſt ſuffer. And if there be not the like
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1082102400:7"/>
regard in the Inferior Officers in the Church toward the Superior; but all affect to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them ſelves, and to be the Head; there can be nothing elſe but <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Confuſion</hi> in it, for <hi>if all will be one Member, where then is the Body?</hi> v. 19.</p>
               <p>I ſhall crave leave only to add to this Head, that this ſubordination of Miniſters in the Church of Chriſt, is agreeable to what was practis'd both under the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> and that of <hi>Moſes;</hi> I need not take notice of the <hi>Heathen</hi> World, who were left to bare <hi>Reaſon</hi> in this matter; among whom we every where find a <hi>diſtinction</hi> of dignity in the Orders of their Prieſts; the thing being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent among the Worſhippers of the <hi>True</hi> God, who were not without ſome light of <hi>Revelation</hi> even under the Law of Nature, long before the <hi>Moſaical</hi> diſpenſation; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himſelf paid Tithes to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> and was bleſſed by him, and <hi>without all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction the Leſs is bleſſed of the Greater,</hi> as the Author to the <hi>Heb.</hi> argues c. 7. v. 7. The <hi>Prieſthood</hi> was a natural right of <hi>Primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> at firſt, and God by a particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand order'd the <hi>Firſt-Born</hi> to be Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1082102400:8"/>
to his Service; and 'tis no queſtion but theſe are the <hi>Prieſts</hi> which we read of before the giving of the Law. <hi>Exodus,</hi> 19. 21, 22. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes <hi>go down, charge the People leaſt they break through unto the Lord, to gaze and many of them periſh; and let the Prieſts alſo which come near to the Lord, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy themſelves, leaſt the Lord break forth among them.</hi> And yet theſe firſt Born, thus honour'd with the Prieſthood, were ſubject to the <hi>Heads</hi> of their <hi>Families,</hi> and commanded by them. Thus <hi>Moſes,</hi> and under him the Twelve Heads of <hi>Tribes,</hi> and the Seventy Fathers of <hi>Families,</hi> governed the Church, till it pleaſed God to take to himſelf the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Firſt-Born;</hi> and then the <hi>High-Prieſt, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter'd in the Service of God, in an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Subordination.</hi> From all which I think it is very plain, that a <hi>Co-ordinate</hi> miniſtery, or a <hi>Parity</hi> among all ſuch as are employed about holy things, is a Scheme that never was found in any <hi>Nation,</hi> or <hi>Age</hi> of the World; it was never either Commanded of God, or Invented by Men, till the confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Late</hi> times brought it forth, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1082102400:9"/>
let the <hi>Enemies</hi> of our Church have the honour of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Subordination of theſe Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eſtabliſh'd, we are now to conſider what they were, wherein they differ'd, and what were the peculiar Employments and Powers of each Office. Now in order to find out this, we muſt compare the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of them in this place, with the other in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. Here it is, <hi>he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> There it is thus, <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily Prophets, thirdly Teachers;</hi> after which no more <hi>Orders</hi> are named, but only thoſe <hi>Powers</hi> that attended them in their work; <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Gifts of Healing,</hi> &amp;c. and at v. 29. the Apoſtle asks, <hi>Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> and without enquiring after more <hi>Orders,</hi> asks only of the Exerciſe of ſuch <hi>Powers</hi> as are before mentioned. <hi>Are all workers of Miracles? Have all the gift of Healing? Do all ſpeak with Tongues? Do all Interpret?</hi> Whence it ſeems very reaſonable to infer, that <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> in the one place, muſt be the ſame with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1082102400:10"/>
                  <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets and Teachers</hi> in the other, and that <hi>Paſtors and Teachers</hi> which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded over and above in my <hi>Text,</hi> muſt not be different <hi>Officers</hi> from thoſe before named, but other <hi>Words</hi> for the ſame Officers, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the different manner of receiving their <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> or the different parts of their Employments. And therefore it is the Judgment of very Learned men that <hi>Prophets and Evangeliſts</hi> and <hi>Prophets and Teachers</hi> are the very ſame Miniſters, with <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> with this only difference, that the <hi>former</hi> were ſuch as out of the <hi>Firſt-Fruits</hi> of the Believers were ſet apart and conſecrated to their Office by the <hi>Manifeſtation of the Spirit,</hi> or by a Supernatural effuſion of Gifts proper to their Employments. The <hi>latter</hi> were ſuch as were Ordained and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Impoſition of Hands,</hi> as ſtated Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Churches allotted to their Charge. However this be, it is plain that <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> in the one place are called <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> in the other, from their <hi>Teaching</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing their Converts, and it ſeems as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that Chriſtian <hi>Prophets</hi> may be called <hi>Paſtors</hi> from their <hi>Feeding</hi> and Governing their Flocks; ſo that whether theſe are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1082102400:11"/>
Names for the very ſame <hi>Perſons,</hi> or whether they ſignify the ſame <hi>Office,</hi> but with this difference, that the one reſpects it, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven immediately by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the other by the Impoſition of the Hands of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the reſult will be the ſame; that there are only <hi>Three</hi> Orders properly here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and that it is of their Office and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments that we are to enquire.</p>
               <p>And I the rather encline to this Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it is agreeable to the <hi>Promiſe</hi> and <hi>Prediction</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, while he was upon Earth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 34. <hi>Behold I ſend to you Prophets, and Wiſe men, and Scribes, and ſome of them you ſhall kill and crucify,</hi> &amp;c. Where there are only theſe Three Orders promis'd; the <hi>Second</hi> of which though here firſt placed, are called by the ſame name as in the <hi>Text, Prophets.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> are called <hi>Wiſe men,</hi> agreeably to their diſtinguiſhing Gift, which we ſhall ſee by and by was the <hi>Word of Wiſdom;</hi> and therefore St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Evangeliſt, calls them by the ſame Name which St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf gives them, that of <hi>Apoſtles</hi> c. 11. v. 49. <hi>Therefore alſo ſaid the Wiſdom of God, I will ſend them Prophets</hi>

firſt, and ſo to aſcend to what was peculiar to the reſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> or <hi>Teachers:</hi> their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was properly to <hi>preach</hi> the Goſpel to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers,</hi> to convince them of its Truth by working <hi>Miracles,</hi> and to <hi>Baptize</hi> them upon their Converſion.

3. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> beſides all this, had the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme <hi>care of all the Churches</hi> upon them; they were to give <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> for their eſtabliſhment, to <hi>Confirm</hi> Converts, <hi>Ordain</hi> Church Officers, and <hi>Govern</hi> and <hi>Direct</hi> them when Ordain'd; and by this means to preſerve that <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> which became the Church of Chriſt. Thus we find in the forementioned 8th of the <hi>Acts.</hi> v. 14. that <hi>when the Apoſtles had heard that</hi> Samaria <hi>had receiv'd the Word of God,</hi> by <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt, they ſent unto them</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>and</hi> John, the Apoſtles, <hi>who when they were come down, prayed for them that they might rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eive the Holy Ghoſt. For as yet he was fallen upon none of them, only they were Baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus; then laid they their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> That is, the Powers and Gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> which fitted them for the ſeveral parts of the <hi>Miniſtery:</hi> for ſo we ſee it. <hi>Acts,</hi> 19. 6. when <hi>Paul</hi> hah laid his hands upon thoſe Converts at <hi>Epheſus, the Holy Ghoſt came upon them, and they ſpake with Tongues and Prophecyed.</hi> i. e. had the Power of <hi>Miracles,</hi> and particularly that of <hi>Tongues</hi> given them to convert <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,</hi> and that of <hi>Prophecy</hi> to direct the

                  <hi>Faithful.</hi> And beſides this we find the ſame Apoſtle c. 14. 21. going over the ſeveral <hi>Churches, Confirming the Souls of the Diſciples, exhorting them to continue in the Faith, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Elders</hi> or Church Officers <hi>in every Church,</hi> and then <hi>commending them to the Lord on whom they believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such was the <hi>Subordination</hi> of <hi>Officers</hi> in the Church of Chriſt. And it pleaſed our Lord to accommodate his <hi>Gifts</hi> to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their ſeveral Employments, and theſe we have likewiſe laid down, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. &amp;c. <hi>To one is given by the Spirit the word of Wiſdom, to another knowledge by the ſame Spirit, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith by the ſame Spirit.</hi> Where the Gifts of <hi>Wiſdom, Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> Anſwer to the Three ſorts of Miniſters. v. 28, 29. <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="3">(3) Thus does the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſettling the Oeconomy of his Church: But we muſt in the Third place Adore his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in having preſerved this excellent Order to us, however unworthy of ſo great a Bleſſing.

anſwerable to the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> in my Text, but we have the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Authority derived to us by a continued Succeſſion of our <hi>Biſhops</hi> from the Apoſtles themſelves. Such as theſe the Scripture tells us the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles committed their Authority to, ſuch have all ages of the Church acknowledged for the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, and it has been by the Care and Conduct of ſuch, that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies</hi> have been conquer'd, <hi>Schiſms</hi> prevented or repair'd; and the purity of the Chriſtian <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> handed down to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times; and therefore we have a great deal of reaſon to be thankful to Almighty God, that among all the Confuſions of this latter Age, he has been pleaſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to us this ineſtimable advantage.</p>
               <p>Nor ought we to overlook the <hi>Grace</hi> and Mercy of God, who in theſe times of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, has been pleaſed to give to the <hi>preſent</hi> Governours of our poor Church, ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an effuſion of that <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom</hi> which attended the Apoſtles their Predeceſſors, and who conſtantly directs them in ſupplying the places of thoſe whom their Lord calls away from their Labours, with perſons diſtinguiſh'd

               <p>III. We muſt therefore haſten to the Third thing to be conſidered, the <hi>end</hi> and deſign of this Diſpenſation, in theſe Words. <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here are Three Excellent ends of this Order, to which we muſt briefly give a diſtinct Conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is <hi>The perfecting of the Saints,</hi> Or the Uniting the ſeveral Members of Chriſt's Church to <hi>one another,</hi> and to himſelf their <hi>Head,</hi> that by the Miniſtery of the different Parts his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> might be orderly conveyed to the whole <hi>Body</hi> for its Spiritual improvement and <hi>Perfection;</hi> for ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows v. 13. <hi>Till we all come in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> And this is conſonant to what the Apoſtle ſays upon the ſame occaſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25. All this was done, <hi>That there ſhould be no Schiſm in the Body, but that the Members ſhould have the ſame care one of another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1082102400:24"/>
2. The Second end is <hi>The work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,</hi> that it might be <hi>regular,</hi> and <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>ſucceſsful</hi> to that great end for which it was Ordained; that all who are employed in it, might be confin'd to their proper <hi>Poſts</hi> and proper <hi>Work,</hi> and not obſtruct the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Goſpel by wandring out of their due Ranks and Stations, that the <hi>Feet</hi> might not affect the work or place of the <hi>Hands,</hi> and neither of them that of the <hi>Head;</hi> but that they might remember that 'tis <hi>God</hi> who <hi>hath ſet the Members every one in the Body, as it has pleaſed him,</hi> and that <hi>if they were all one Member, there would be no Body.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 18. 'Tis in purſuance of this, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> c. 14. commands that all things in the Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies be done <hi>decently and in Order,</hi> and that the Prophets themſelves obſerve the Rules preſcribed them, telling them v. 32. that <hi>the Spirits of the Prophets are Subject to the Prophets, for God is not the Author of confuſion but of peace, as in all Churches of the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The third end is what follows from the bleſſing of God upon the work of the Miniſtery, and that is, the <hi>Edifying of the Body of</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1082102400:25"/>
                  <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> the confirming Believers in a ſound <hi>Faith</hi> and a holy <hi>Life;</hi> the former St. <hi>Paul</hi> inſtances in at the 14th. v. <hi>That we henceforth be no more Children toſſed to and fro, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with every wind of Doctrine, by the ſlight of men, and cunning craftineſs whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</hi> And the latter at v. 17. <hi>this I ſay therefore and teſtifie in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles walk in the vanity of their minds.</hi> And he joins both together at v. 15. <hi>but ſpeaking the truth in Love ye may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>Thus have we conſider'd the different <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of the Miniſtery, the <hi>Author</hi> of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs</hi> of it to the Church of Chriſt, ſuffer me now to draw two or three Concluſions from what has been ſaid, which I ſhall do very briefly, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Is the Manifeſtation of the Spirit <hi>given to every man to profit withall?</hi> Were theſe Orders Inſtituted, not to gratifie the Vanity or Ambition of the <hi>Perſons</hi> employ'd, but to ſerve and feed the <hi>Flock</hi> of Chriſt? then all thoſe that are call'd to any holy Function
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1082102400:26"/>
muſt remember, that they are called to be <hi>Watchful</hi> and <hi>Diligent;</hi> to deny themſelves and to guide others; to labour hard, to bear much, and to apply their whole Thoughts to acquit themſelves to their great Maſter, and to carry on the Salvation of thoſe Souls which he has <hi>purchas'd with his own Blood.</hi> And whoever ſhall through <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>Sloth</hi> or <hi>unconcern</hi> neglect this work of the Lord, or do it deceitfully, he betrays a Sacred Truſt, abuſes his Talents, and will one day receive the bitter Sentence of the unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Is <hi>God</hi> the Author of this Inſtitution? and is the <hi>Church</hi> edified by the work of its Paſtors?
