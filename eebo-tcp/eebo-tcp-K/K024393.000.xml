            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS againſt the Practice of Inoculating the Small-Pox.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O give an Account of the Small-Pox, or to run through the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sorts and Stages of it, would be too tedious at preſent; and which having been already done by Men of Eminency in the Profeſſion of Phyſick, it would be Preſumption
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0090400900:7"/>and Trifling in me, to offend by a leſs perfect Account of my own.</p>
            <p>THIS Epidemical contagious Diſeaſe, contracted from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of Air heterogene to our Bodies, betrays itſelf by Pains of the Back and Head, Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Limbs, Vomitings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> uſually two or three Days before the Eruption of the Puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules; after which, for the moſt part, the Patient feels a Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Symptoms: and the kind Maturation of the Puſtules generally frees the infected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in twelve or fourteen Days, unleſs ſomething unexpected ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds. In this Diſtemper, Nature labours with all her Force, to clear the Blood of the Poiſon, till by degrees ſhe drives it from the Center to the Surface, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0090400900:8"/>effects an univerſal Depuration: but how far this laudable Work will be carried on by the new Method of Ingrafting or Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, ſhall be our next Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>IN order to which, we will preſume the Infection of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way to be with the Air firſt admitted into the Lungs, whence, by the common Circle of the Blood, by degrees it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the whole Body; which Pollution being thus gradually introduced, occaſions not ſuch mighty Revels in the Blood, as to take off one in twenty, unleſs a more Malignant Sort than uſual (God be praiſed) rages in our Clime; and then I fear the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation of ſuch a one would prove as dangerous to us as the worſt of the accidental. And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0090400900:9"/>unleſs the preſent Method was wholly void of any fatal Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and the Patient entirely ſecure in the Experiment, (

                  </gap> Method.</note> of which we have had a late melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Inſtance to the contrary) it would be the higheſt Piece of Raſhneſs and Cruelty to give up our Children Sacrifices to the fond Deluſion of averting an Ill that may be, by the Anticipation of it at preſent, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a good Event in this, is as uncertain as it may prove to them in any Period of Life from the other; nay, perhaps the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt may be ſpun without the Tryal of it at all.</p>
            <p>THE inſtilling of Poiſon into a Wound has always been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0090400900:10"/>the moſt deſtructive of any; for though the Blood thus fermented may betray itſelf in the ſhape of the Small-Pox, yet it has always a Reſort to a poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Fountain, from which it every Moment receives new Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies: and as by degrees the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Particles in the Wound begin to abate of their Fury, the Symptoms become more lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid, which though incapable to excite the higheſt Diſorders, yet in their Return may create Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in the ſmaller Veſſels of the Groins, Arm-pits, Joints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Conſequences of which are frequently greater than the Diſeaſe itſelf, and ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</p>
            <p>WHICH brings to my Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an Experiment of a Pretender to Phyſick, whoſe Ability conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0090400900:11"/>in a Secret to fortify the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach againſt the Attacks of the moſt malignant Poiſon: The Curioſity of the Populace ſoon eas'd him of his Packets, in which was found this plain Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Take this, you'll want no other;</hi> and indeed he ſpoke Truth: for the Patient whoſe Stupidity led him to the Tryal, narrowly eſcaped with Life; of which, if he makes a Repetition, he juſtly deſerves to loſe it. However, the Quack got what he wanted, and the Peoples Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was the leaſt of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
            <p>IT is very obſervable in Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedenical Ulcers, when at any time they appear dryer than ordinary, that the leaſt Portion of Matter lick'd up by the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, excites Fevers, Frenzies, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0090400900:12"/>other direful Symptoms; and if Nature is not compenſated by ſome critical Swelling, or other Evacuation, the Patient dies: in whom oftentimes the Liver, Spleen, Pancreas, are ſo affected, as to become monſtrouſly big and knotty. How then can we determine for the Infuſion of this Poiſon, that it ſhall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the like Effects? There is a wide Difference between extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated Matter in a State of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and the Poiſon of the Blood not yet thrown out: the former, as the Yeaſt or Flowers of fermented Liquors, will in the ſmalleſt Proportion ſubdue large Quantities; when the other whilſt it maintains its common Courſe with the Blood, receives conſtant Checks from the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Additions of that Liquor, and the ſeveral Ways of Evacuation;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0090400900:13"/>as is evident from ſome Inſtances of the Small-Pox, where the Skin is ſo ſparingly beſet with Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as not to exceed five or ſix in number, and yet the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient as ſecure from a ſecond Infection as thoſe who have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from a Redundancy of them. Yet even in theſe, when there ſhall happen a Recall of that Matter, though inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in Quantity, the worſt of Symptoms ariſe, and Death often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times follows.</p>
            <p>THE Degrees of Activity in the Poiſon of this Diſtemper, will vary much, according to the Degrees of Exaltation it may receive from the different Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of different Conſtitutions, the Stimulus of which will in ſome be more pointed, and in others leſs; and the Injuries ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0090400900:14"/>of courſe will be ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the Nature of theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula or Darts, ſo inimical to the Craſis of our Blood.</p>
            <p>WE find in the Poiſon of the Viper, when thoroughly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to an Emiſſion of it, the Salts of that Liquor to be ſo obdurate and inflexible, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome of the Fat of that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal be inſtantly inſtill'd into the Wound made by his Teeth, no Remedy proves equal to the Cure; and if perchance the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſurvives the Accident, I dare be bold to ſay, a ſecond Attack would prove as fatal as the firſt.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS it may be reply'd, That it is peculiar to the Small-Pox to affect us but once; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Experience happily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0090400900:15"/>this Truth; for were we ſubject to the Repetition of it, Life would prove a Burden: and we might well with St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>Of all, we are the moſt Wretched.</hi> But how far this new Exhibition of it will agree with the accidental Infection, ſhall be our next Task.</p>
            <p>THE rendring a Wound in any part of the Body, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming the ſame with a poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Juice, till by the Irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, each Fibril becomes ſo fretted, as to produce an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, is a dangerous Experiment; for that, whatſoever Blood is ſent to that Part, will be changed into the Nature of the Leaven in the Sore, which may furniſh it with greater Supplies than the Conſtitution can bear, the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of which increaſing every
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0090400900:16"/>Moment in proportion to the Ferment made there, the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms will haſten according to the Addition receiv'd, that if a kind Maturation enſues not in a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time, the Part thus wounded may be in danger of a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, and the Malignancy of the Sore ſo complicated, as to communicate the Corruption of the one, and the Infection of the other, at the ſame time. From whence I need not prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate the Event, which would but too evidently infer Death, or at leaſt the Loſs of that Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>WHEN in the natural Way the Matter is gradually thrown out, and is contained under the Skin, where it forms to itſelf diſtinct Eminencies or Puſtules, receiving their common Capſule
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0090400900:17"/>from the Cutis, or true Skin; which puſhing forwards, the more watery or thin Subſtance tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires, and raiſes the Cuticula in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like Protuberances, that you may plainly diſcern a Pock contained in a Pock; that in the Cutis holding the groſſeſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and moſt fitted for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of which, is the Bulk of the other. Which Contrivance is admirable; for that the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Air frequently damps the more ſuperficial Appearances, which ſink and flatten, when by the Uſe of warm Internals, the inward ones revive, and both are renew'd afreſh; at laſt the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Part is perſpired, and the thicker left to incruſtate and ſhell off, without any Fears of freſh Supplies of Infection. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture having by this kind Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0090400900:18"/>finiſhed her Work, when in the inoculated Way, the Sore ſhall continue for Weeks after the Pox, and not without Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty heal at laſt. And though the Blood be diſpirited and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from its late Conflict, as not eaſily to admit a ſecond, or to occaſion the ſame Velocity or Heat, yet ſuch Impreſſions may be made on it, as to diſpoſe it for Swellings on the Joints, Shoulders, Groins, and other Parts; Conſequences confeſſed by Dr. <hi>Nettleton,</hi> in his Book to Dr. <hi>Whittaker,</hi> to have happen'd.</p>
            <p>IT is certain that Poiſon lick'd up by the Veſſels from a Wound, will ever produce Effects an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to its Nature; and thoſe Puſtules thrown out by this new Method, are but ſo many Efforts induſtriouſly made to expel the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0090400900:19"/>Enemy; which Method, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as renew'd, will cauſe the ſame Symptoms either to thoſe who have ſuffered by the natural or artificial Pox, as has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced on a Patient at St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Hoſpital; who though he had had them, yet labour'd with the uſual Symptoms of their new Method. Nor can Reaſon juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the contrary; for the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Matter, thus infuſed, will always be the ſame; that unleſs we could ſuppoſe ſome ſingular Vertue to remain in the Blood as a proper Antagoniſt, it would be abſurd to think them ſecure from a ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection, any more than that the Transſuſion of the Blood or Matter of a venereal pocky Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into a ſound Habit, ſhould ſecure him from any future A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with Impunity. What
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0090400900:20"/>though the Symptoms may ape thoſe of the Small-Pox, and the Protuberances of the Skin bear a near Reſemblance, yet the Way of Communication differs much.

            <p>THE Life of every one thus inoculated, is as emirently in danger, as in thoſe who ſuffer from it the accidental Way; as appears by the Symptoms enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated by Dr. <hi>Nettleton</hi> to Dr. <hi>Whittaker;</hi> and the Continuance of it much longer, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance the poiſonous Wound ſhould occaſion no worſe Ills than uſually expected.
