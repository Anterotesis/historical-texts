            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>For my part, as I was never diſtinguiſhed for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and have often even blundered in making my bow, ſuch bodings as theſe had like to have totally repreſſed my ambition. I was at a loſs whether to give the public ſpecious promiſes, or give none; whether to be merry or ſad on this ſolemn occaſion. If I ſhould modeſtly decline all merit, it was too probable the haſty reader might have taken me at my word. If, on the other hand, like labourers in the Magazine trade, I had, with modeſt impudence, humbly preſumed to promiſe an epitome of all the good things that ever were ſaid or written, this might have diſguſted thoſe readers I moſt deſire to pleaſe. Had I been merry, I might have been cenſured as <hi>vaſtly low</hi>; and had I been ſorrowful, I might have been left to mourn in ſolitude and ſilence: In ſhort, which ever way I turned, nothing preſented but proſpects of terror, deſpair, chandlers ſhops, and waſte paper.</p>
               <p>In this debate between fear and ambition, my publiſher happening to arrive, interrupted for a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0201400800:6"/>
while my anxiety. Perceiving my embarraſment about making my firſt appearance, he inſtantly offered his aſſiſtance and advice: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"You muſt know, ſir, ſays he, that the republic of letters is at preſent divided into three claſſes. One writer, for inſtance, excels at a plan, or a title-page, another works away the body of the book, and a third is a dab at an index. Thus a Magazine is not the reſult of any ſingle man's induſtry; but goes through as many hands as a new pin, before it is fit for the public. I fancy, ſir, continues he, I can provide an eminent hand, and upon moderate terms, to draw up a promiſing plan to ſmooth up our readers a little, and pay them, as colonel Charteris paid his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio, at the rate of three halfpence in hand, and three ſhillings more in promiſes."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was proceeding in his advice, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I thought proper to decline, by aſſuring him, that as I intended to purſue no fixed method, ſo it was impoſſible to form any regular plan; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined never to be tedious, in order to be logical, wherever pleaſure preſented, I was reſolved to follow. Like the BEE, which I had taken for the title of my paper, I would rove from flower to flower, with ſeeming inattention, but concealed choice, expatiate over all the beauties of the ſeaſon, and make my induſtry my amuſement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0201400800:7"/>This reply may alſo ſerve as an apology to the reader, who expects, before he fits down, a bill of his future entertainment. It would be improper to pall his curioſity by leſſening his ſurprize, or anticipate any pleaſure I am able to procure him, by ſaying what ſhall come next. Thus much, however, he may be aſſured of, that neither war nor ſcandal ſhall make any part of it. Homer finely imagines his deity turning away with horror from the proſpect of a field of battle, and ſeeking tranquility among a nation noted for peace and ſimplicity. Happy could any effort of mine, but for a moment, repreſs that ſavage pleaſure ſome men find in the daily accounts of human miſery! How gladly would I lead them from ſcenes of blood and altercation, to proſpects of innocence and eaſe, where every breeze breaths health, and every found is but the echo of tranquility.</p>
               <p>But whatever the merit of his intentions may be, every writer is now convinced that he muſt be chiefly indebted to good fortune for finding readers willing to allow him any degree of reputation. It has been remarked, that almoſt every character which has excited either attention or praiſe, has owed part of its ſucceſs to merit, and part to an happy concurrence of circumſtances in its favour. Had Caeſar or Cromwell exchanged countries, the one might have been a ſerjeant, and the other an exciſeman. So it is with wit, which generally
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0201400800:8"/>
ſucceeds more from being happily addreſſed, than from its native poignancy. A <hi>bon mot,</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that might be reliſhed at White's, may loſe all its flavour when delivered at the Cat and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes in St. Giles's. A jeſt calculated to ſpread at a gaming-table, may be received with a perfect neutrality of face ſhould it happen to drop in a mackrel-boat. We have all ſeen dunces triumph in ſome companies, where men of real humour were diſregarded, by a general combination in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſtupidity. To drive the obſervation as far as it will go, ſhould the labours of a writer who deſigns his performances for readers of a more refined appetite fall into the hands of a devourer of compilations, what can he expect but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and confuſion. If his merits are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by judges who eſtimate the value of a book from its bulk, or its frontiſpiece, every rival muſt acquire an eaſy ſuperiority, who with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive eloquence promiſes four extraordinary pages of <hi>letter preſs,</hi> or three beautiful prints, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly coloured from nature.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; though I cannot promiſe as much entertainment, or as much elegance as others have done, yet the reader may be aſſured he ſhall have as much of both as I can. He ſhall, at leaſt, find me alive while I ſtudy his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for I ſolemnly aſſure him, I was never yet
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0201400800:9"/>
poſſeſſed of the ſecret at once of writing and ſleeping.</p>
               <p>During the courſe of this paper, therefore, all the wit and learning I have, are heartily at his ſervice; which if, after ſo candid a confeſſion he ſhould, notwithſtanding, ſtill find intolerably dull, low, or ſad ſtuff, this I proteſt is more than I know. I have a clear conſcience, and am entirely out of the ſecret.</p>
               <p>Yet I would not have him, upon the peruſal of a ſingle paper, pronounce me incorrigible; he may try a ſecond, which, as there is a ſtudied difference in ſubject and ſtyle, may be more ſuited to his taſte; if this alſo fails, I muſt refer him to a third, or even to a fourth, in caſe of extremity: If he ſhould ſtill continue refractory, and find me dull to the laſt, I muſt inform him, with Bays in the Rehearſal, that I think him a very odd kind of a fellow, and deſire no more of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>It is with ſuch reflections as theſe I endeavour to fortify myſelf againſt the future contempt or neglect of ſome readers, and am prepared for their diſlike by mutual recrimination. If ſuch ſhould impute dealing neither in battles nor ſcandal to me as a fault, inſtead of acquieſcing in their cenſure, I muſt beg leave to tell them a ſtory.</p>

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0201400800:10"/>A traveller, in his way to Italy, happening to paſs at the foot of the Alps, found himſelf at laſt in a country where the inhabitants had each a large excreſcence depending from the chin, like the pouch of a monkey. This deformity, as it was endemic, and the people little uſed to ſtrangers, it had been the cuſtom, time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial, to look upon as the greateſt ornament of the human viſage. Ladies grew toaſts from the ſize of their chins, and none were regarded as pretty fellows, but ſuch whoſe faces were broadeſt at the bottom. It was Sunday, a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try church was at hand, and our traveller was willing to perform the duties of the day. Upon his firſt appearance at the church door, the eyes of all were naturally fixed upon the ſtranger; but what was their amazement, when they found that he actually wanted that emblem of beauty, a purſed chin. This was a defect that not a ſingle crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had ſufficient gravity (though they were noted for being grave) to withſtand. Stifled burſts of laughter, winks, and whiſpers circulated from viſage to viſage, and the priſmatic figure of the ſtranger's face was a fund of infinite gaiety; even the parſon, equally remarkable for his gravity and chin, could hardly refrain joining in the good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Our traveller could no longer patiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue an object for deformity to point at. Good folks, ſaid he, I perceive that I am the unfortunate cauſe of all this good humour. It is true, I may

               <head>REMARKS ON OUR THEATRES.</head>
               <p>OUR theatres are now opened, and all Grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet is preparing its advice to the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; we ſhall undoubtedly hear learned diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions on the ſtructure of one actor's legs, and another's eye-brows. We ſhall be told much of enunciations, tones and attitudes, and ſhall have our lighteſt pleaſures commented upon by didactic dullneſs. We ſhall, it is feared, be told, that Garrick is a fine actor, but then, as a manager, ſo avaricious! That Palmer is a moſt promiſing genius, and Holland likely to do well, in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſt of character. We ſhall have them giving Shuter inſtructions to amuſe us by rule, and deploring over the ruins of deſolated Majeſty in Covent-Garden. As I love to be adviſing too, for advice is eaſily given, and bears a ſhew of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom and ſuperiority, I muſt be permitted to offer a few obſervations upon our theatres and actors, without, on this trivial occaſion, throwing my thoughts into the formality of method.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0201400800:13"/>There is ſomething in the deportment of all our players infinitely more ſtiff and formal than among the actors of other nations. Their action ſits uneaſy upon them; for as the Engliſh uſe very little geſture in ordinary converſation, our Engliſh-bred actors are obliged to ſupply ſtage geſtures by their imagination alone. A French comedian finds proper models of action in every company and in every coffee-houſe he enters. An Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is obliged to take his models from the ſtage itſelf; he is obliged to imitate nature from an imitation of nature. I know of no ſet of men more likely to be improved by travelling than thoſe of the theatrical profeſſion. The inhabitants of the continent are leſs reſerved than here; they may be ſeen through upon a firſt acquaintance; ſuch are the proper models to draw from; they are at once ſtriking, and are found in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>Though it would be inexcuſable in a comedian to add any thing of his own to the Poet's dialogue, yet as to action he is entirely at liberty. By this he may ſhew the fertility of his genius, the poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of his humour, and the exactneſs of his judgment; we ſcarce ſee a coxcomb or a fool in common life, that has not ſome peculiar oddity in his action. Theſe peculiarities it is not in the power of words to repreſent, and depend ſolely upon the actor. They give a reliſh to the humour
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0201400800:14"/>
of the poet, and make the appearance of nature more illuſive; the Italians, it is true, maſk ſome characters, and endeavour to preſerve the peculiar humour by the make of the maſk; but I have ſeen others ſtill preſerve a great fund of humour in the face without a maſk; one actor, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, by a ſquint which he threw into ſome characters of low life, aſſumed a book of infinite ſolidity. This, though upon reflection we might condemn, yet, immediately, upon repreſentation, we could not avoid being pleaſed with. To il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate what I have been ſaying by the plays I have of late gone to ſee: In the Miſer which was played a few nights ago at Covent-Garden, Love-gold appears through the whole in circumſtances of exaggerated avarice; all the player's action, therefore, ſhould conſpire with the poet's deſign, and repreſent him as an epitome of penury. The French comedian, in this character, in the midſt of one of his moſt violent paſſions, while he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in an ungovernable rage, feels the demon of avarice ſtill upon him, and ſtoops down to pick up a pin, which he quilts into the flap of his coat-pocket with great aſſiduity. Two candles are lighted up for his wedding; he flies, and turns one of them into the ſocket; it is, however, lighted up again; he then ſteals to it, and privately crams it into his pocket. The Mock-Doctor was lately played at the other houſe. Here again the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian had an opportunity of heightening the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0201400800:15"/>
by action. The French player ſits in a chair with an high back, and then begins to ſhew away by talking nonſenſe, which he would have thought latin by thoſe whom he knows do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a ſyllable of the matter. At laſt he grows enthuſiaſtic, enjoys the admiration of the company, toſſes his legs and arms about, and in the midſt of his raptures and vociferation, he and the chair fall back together. All this appears dull enough in the recital, but the gravity of Cato could not ſtand it in the repreſentation. In ſhort, there is hardly a character in comedy to which a player of any real humour, might not add ſtrokes of vivacity that could not fail of applauſe. But inſtead of this we too often ſee our fine gentlemen do nothing through a whole part, but ſtrut, and open their ſnuff-box; our pretty fellows ſit indecently with their legs acroſs, and our clowns pull up their breeches. Theſe, if once, or even twice repeated, might do well enough; but to ſee them ſerved up in every ſcene, argues the actor almoſt as barren as the character he would expoſe.</p>
               <p>The magnificence of our theatres is far ſuperior to any others in Europe where plays only are acted. The great care our performers take in painting for a part, their exactneſs in all the minutiae of dreſs, and other little ſcenical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, have been taken notice of by Ricoboni, a gentleman of Italy, who travelled Europe with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0201400800:16"/>
no other deſign but to remark upon the ſtage; but there are ſeveral apparent improprieties ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, or lately come into faſhion. As, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſpreading a carpet punctually at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the death ſcene, in order to prevent our actors from ſpoiling their cloaths; this imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately apprizes us of the tragedy to follow; for laying the cloth is not a more ſure indication of dinner than laying the carpet of bloody work at Drury-Lane. Our little pages alſo with unmean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faces, that bear up the train of a weeping princeſs, and our aukward lords in waiting, take off much from her diſtreſs. Mutes of every kind divide our attention, and leſſen our ſenſibility; but here it is entirely ridiculous, as we ſee them ſeriouſly employed in doing nothing. If we muſt have dirty-ſhirted guards upon the theatres, they ſhould be taught to keep their eyes fixed on the actors, and not roll them round upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as if they were ogling the boxes.</p>
               <p>Beauty methinks ſeems a requiſite qualification in an actreſs. This ſeems ſcrupulouſly obſerved elſewhere, and for my part I could wiſh to ſee it obſerved at home. I can never conceive an hero dying for love of a lady totally deſtitute of beuaty. I muſt think the part unnatural, for I cannot bear to hear him call that face angelic, when even paint cannot hide its wrinkles. I muſt condemn him of ſtupidity, and the perſon whom
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0201400800:17"/>
I can accuſe for want of taſte will ſeldom become the object of my affections or admiration. But if this be a defect, what muſt be the entire perverſion of ſcenical decorum, when for inſtance we ſee an actreſs that might act the Wapping Landlady without a bolſter, pining in the character of Jane Shore, and while unwieldy with fat endeavouring to convince the audience that ſhe is dying with hunger.</p>
               <p>For the future then, I could wiſh that the parts of the young or beautiful were given to performers of ſuitable figures; for I muſt own, I could rather ſee the ſtage filled with agreeable objects, though they might ſome times bungle a little, than ſee it crowded with withered or miſhapen figures, be their emphaſis, as I think it is called, ever ſo proper. The firſt may have the awkward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of new-raiſed troops, but in viewing the laſt, I cannot avoid the mortification of fancying myſelf placed in an hoſpital of invalids.</p>

               <head>THE STORY OF ALCANDER and SEPTIMIUS. Tranſlated from a BYZANTINE HISTORIAN.</head>
               <p>ATHENS, even long after the decline of the Roman empire, ſtill continued the ſeat of learning, politeneſs and wiſdom. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and the generals, who in theſe periods of approaching ignorance, ſtill felt a paſſion for ſcience, from time to time, added to its buildings, or encreaſed its profeſſorſhips. Theodoric, the Oſtrogoth, was of the number; he repaired thoſe ſchools which barbarity was ſuffering to fall into decay, and continued thoſe penſions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polized to themſelves.</p>
               <p>In this city, and about this period, Alcander and Septimius were fellow ſtudents together. The
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0201400800:19"/>
one the moſt ſubtle reaſoner of all the Lyceum; the other the moſt eloquent ſpeaker in the acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic grove. Mutual admiration ſoon begot an acquaintance, and a ſimilitude of diſpoſition made them perfect friends. Their fortunes were nearly equal, their ſtudies the ſame, and they were natives of the two moſt celebrated cities in the world; for Alcander was of Athens, Septimius came from Rome.</p>
               <p>In this mutual harmony they lived for ſome time together, when Alcander, after paſſing the firſt part of his youth in the indolence of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, thought at length of entering into the buſy world, and as a ſtep previous to this, placed his affections on Hypatia, a lady of exquiſite beauty. Hypatia ſhewed no diſlike to his addreſſes: The day of their intended nuptials was fixed, the previous ceremonies were performed, and nothing now remained but her being conducted in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to the apartment of the intended bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.</p>
               <p>An exultation in his own happineſs, or his being unable to enjoy any ſatisfaction without making his friend Septimius a partner, prevailed upon him to introduce his miſtreſs to his fellow ſtudent, which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found himſelf equally happy in friendſhip and love. But this was an interview fatal to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0201400800:20"/>
the future peace of both. Septimius no ſooner ſaw her, but he was ſmit with an involuntary paſſion. He uſed every effort, but in vain, to ſuppreſs deſires at once ſo imprudent and unjuſt. He retired to his apartment in inexpreſſible agony; and the emotions of his mind in a ſhort time became ſo ſtrong, that they brought on a fever, which the phyſicians judged incurable.</p>
               <p>During this illneſs, Alcander watched him with all the anxiety of fondneſs, and brought his miſtreſs to join in thoſe amiable offices of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The ſagacity of the phyſicians, by this means ſoon diſcovered the cauſe of their patient's diſorder; and Alcander being apprized of their diſcovery, at length extorted a confeſſion from the reluctant dying lover.</p>
               <p>It would but delay the narrative to deſcribe the conflict between love and friendſhip in the breaſt of Alcander on this occaſion; it is enough to ſay, that the Athenians were at this time ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to ſuch refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to exceſs. In ſhort, forgetful of his own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms, to the young Roman. They were married privately by his connivance, and this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked-for change of fortune wrought as unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a change in the conſtitution of the now happy Septimius. In a few days he was perfectly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0201400800:21"/>
recovered, and ſet out with his fair partner for Rome. Here, by an exertion of thoſe talents which he was ſo eminently poſſeſſed of, he in a few years arrived at the higheſt dignities of the ſtate, and was conſtituted the city judge, or praetor.</p>
               <p>Mean while Alcander not only felt the pain of being ſeparated from his friend and his miſtreſs, but a proſecution was alſo commenced againſt him by the relations of Hypatia, for his having baſely given her up, as was ſuggeſted, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, or his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to withſtand the influence of a powerful party.</p>
               <p>He was caſt and condemned to pay an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous fine. Unable to raiſe to large a ſum at the time appointed, his poſſeſſions were confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, himſelf ſtript of the habit of freedom, expoſed in the market-place, and ſold as a ſlave to the higheſt bidder.</p>
               <p>A merchant of Thrace becoming his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer, Alcander, with ſome other companions of diſtreſs, was carried into the region of deſolation and ſterility. His ſtated employment was to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the herds of an imperious maſter, and his ſkill in hunting was all that was allowed him to ſupply a precarious ſubſiſtence. Condemned to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0201400800:22"/>
hopeleſs ſervitude every morning, waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of ſeaſon ſerved but to aggravate his unſheltered diſtreſs. Nothing but death or flight was left him, and almoſt certain death was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his attempting to fly. After ſome years of bondage, however, an opportunity of eſcaping offered; he embraced it with ardour, and travelling by night, and lodging in caverns by day, to ſhorten a long ſtory, he at laſt arrived in Rome. The day of Alcander's arrival, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timius ſate in the forum adminiſtring juſtice; and hither our wanderer came, expecting to be inſtantly known, and publickly acknowledged. Here he ſtood the whole day among the crowd, watching the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken notice of, but ſo much was he altered by a long ſucceſſion of hardſhips, that he paſſed entirely without notice; and in the evening, when he was going up to the praetor's chair, he was brutally repulſed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another. Night coming on, he now found himſelf under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſeeking a place to lie in, and yet knew not where to apply. All emaciated, and in rags as he was, none of the citizens would harbour ſo much wretchedneſs, and ſleeping in the ſtreets might be attended with interruption or danger: In ſhort, he was obliged to take up his lodging in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0201400800:23"/>
one of the tombs without the city, the uſual retreat of guilt, poverty or deſpair.</p>
               <p>In this manſion of horror, laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his miſeries for a while in ſleep, and virtue found, on this flinty couch, more eaſe than down can ſupply to the guilty.</p>
               <p>It was midnight, when two robbers came to make this cave their retreat, but happening to diſagree about the diviſion of their plunder, one of them ſtabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the entrance. In theſe circumſtances he was found next morning, and this naturally induced, a further enquiry. The alarm was ſpread, the cave was examined, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cander was found ſleeping, and immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and accuſed of robbery and murder. The circumſtances againſt him were ſtrong, and the wretchedneſs of his appearance confirmed ſuſpicion. Misfortune and he were now ſo long acquainted, that he at laſt became regardleſs of life. He deteſted a world where he had found only ingratitude, falſhood and cruelty, and was determined to make no defence. Thus lowering with reſolution; he was dragged, bound with cords, before the tribunal of Septimius. The proofs were poſitive againſt him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication; the judge, therefore, was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0201400800:24"/>
proceeding to doom him to a moſt cruel and ignominious death, when, as if illumined by a ray from heaven, he diſcovered, through all his miſery, the features, though dim with ſorrow, of his long loſt, lov'd Alcander. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deſcribe his joy and his pain on this ſtrange occaſion. Happy in once more ſeeing the perſon he moſt loved on earth, diſtreſſed at finding him in ſuch circumſtances. Thus agitated by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending paſſions, he flew from his tribunal, and falling on the neck of his dear benefactor, burſt into an agony of diſtreſs.

               <head>A LETTER FROM Mr. VOLTAIRE, TO Mr. D'ARGET, of LAUSANNE.</head>
               <p>YOU demand, my dear friend and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Potſdam, in what manner <note n="*" place="bottom">K. of Pruſſia.</note> Pyrrhus and <note n="†" place="bottom">M. de Voltaire.</note> Cineas have been reconciled. Firſt, then, Pyrrhus turned my tragedy of Merope into an opera, which he ſent me. Again he was ſo kind as to offer me his key, which, however, will not ſerve to open Paradiſe; and to this he added an offer of all his favours; but I am too old to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the favours of kings at preſent. To one of his ſiſters, who has ever preſerved a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for me, I am obliged for theſe marks of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. To her I owe the correſpondence which is now and then renewed between the heroic, poetical, warlike, ſingular, brilliant, proud, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0201400800:26"/>
king, and Cineas the Swiſs, retired from the world to happineſs.</p>
               <p>Would you be ſo good as to pay us a ſhort viſit in this part of the world, I fancy we could ſpend the time agreeably enough; the world does not afford a finer proſpect than that from one of my windows. Imagine a canal on one ſide, that lengthens out of ſight, bordered by an hundred gardens; on the other, the vaſt Genevan lake, like a boundleſs mirrour, reflects the mountains on the oppoſite ſide, that lift themſelves above the clouds, in form of the moſt magnificent am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre; and then I am ſo ſuited with an houſe, I feel no inconvenience except from flies in the midſt of winter. Madame Dennis has ſhewed the elegance of her taſte in the furniture. We live here much more comfortably than Pyrrhus, and I fancy fare better too, when we have a good appetite; without this, neither Pyrr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hus nor Cineas can be happy.</p>
               <p>We acted a tragedy yeſterday; if you chuſe to take a part, you have only to come to be fitted. In this manner we forget the quarrels of kings and of men of letters, thoſe frightful, theſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous! We have had a premature account of a battle between Marſhal Richelieu and the Prince of Brunſwick. I know not whether the Prince can ſucceed, for it is certain I have won fifty guineas
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0201400800:27"/>
from him at cheſs. However, it is poſſible to loſe at cheſs, and win at a game where people play with thirty thouſand bayonets.</p>
               <p>I grant you that the king of Pruſſia may have ſome foibles, but no body underſtands the game he is playing better than he. He has infinite diſpatch, and his troops have been diſciplined long before he came to command them. It is an eaſy matter to conceive how regular machines muſt behave, who have long been uſed to war, who ſee their ſovereign at their head, who are perſonally known to him, and whom he exhorts with his hat in his hand to do their duty. Drole fellows theſe at a platoon, at handling their cartridges, and firing ſix or ſeven times in a minute. Yet with all this dexterity their maſter lately thought that all was loſt. About three months ago he was diſpoſed to die; he bid me adieu both in verſe and proſe, but he is now quite recovered. By his diſcipline and diſpatch he has gained two great battles in the ſpace of a month. He flies to the French, turns back upon the Auſtrians, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes Breſlau, takes forty thouſand priſoners of war, and makes epigrams. We ſhall ſee how this bloody tragedy, ſo pathetic, and yet ſo complicated, will end.</p>
               <p>Happy they, who, with an eye of tranquility, can behold theſe great events of the beſt of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0201400800:28"/>
ſyſtems. As for the affair of the Abbe Prade, I have yet been able to receive no authentic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Fame ſays he is hanged; but ſhe knows not what ſhe ſays. I ſhould be ſorry that all the king's readers ſhould come to an unhappy end.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOU ſee, by the date of my letter, that I am arrived in Poland. When will my wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings be at an end? When will my reſtleſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition give me leave to enjoy the preſent hour? When at Lyons, I thought all happineſs lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Alps; when in Italy, I found myſelf ſtill in want of ſomething, and expected to leave ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude behind me by going into Romelia, and now you find me turning back, ſtill expecting eaſe every where but where I am. It is now ſeven, years ſince I ſaw the face of a ſingle crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0201400800:30"/>
who cared a farthing whether I was dead or alive. Secluded from all the comforts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, friendſhip, or ſociety, I feel the ſolitude of an hermit, but not his eaſe.</p>
               <p>The prince of * * * has taken me in his train, ſo that I am in no danger of ſtarving for this bout. The prince's governor is a rude igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant pedant, and his tutor a battered rake: thus, between two ſuch characters you may imagine he is finely inſtructed. I made ſome attempts to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play all the little knowledge I had acquired by reading or obſervation; but I find myſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as an ignorant intruder. The truth is, I ſhall naver be able to acquire a power of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing myſelf with eaſe in any language but my own; and out of my own country the higheſt character I can ever acquire, is that of being a philoſophic vagabond.</p>
               <p>When I conſider myſelf in the country which was once ſo formidable in war, and ſpread terror and deſolation over the whole Roman empire, I can hardly account for the preſent wretchedneſs and puſilanimity of its inhabitants; a prey to every invader; their cities plundered without an enemy; their magiſtrates ſeeking redreſs by complaints, and not by vigour. Every thing conſpires to raiſe my compaſſion for their miſeries, were not my thoughts too buſily engaged by my own. The
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0201400800:31"/>
whole kingdom is in ſtrange diſorder; when our equipage, which conſiſts of the prince and thirteen attendants, had arrived at ſome towns, there were no conveniences to be found, and we were obliged to have girls to conduct us to the next. I have ſeen a woman travel thus on horſeback before us for thirty miles, and think herſelf highly paid, and make twenty reverences, upon receiving, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy, about two-pence for her trouble. In general we were better ſerved by the women than the men on thoſe occaſions. The men ſeemed directed by a low ſordid intereſt alone; they ſeemed mere machines, and all their thoughts were employed in the care of their horſes If we gently deſired them to make more ſpeed, they took not the leaſt notice; kind language was what they had by no means been uſed to. It was proper to ſpeak to them in the tones of anger, and ſometimes it was even neceſſary to uſe blows, to excite them to their duty. How different theſe from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of England, whom a blow might induce to return the affront ſevenfold. Theſe poor people, however, from being brought up to vile uſage, loſe all the reſpect which they ſhould have for themſelves. They have contracted an habit of regarding conſtraint as the great rule of their duty. When they were treated with mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they no longer continued to perceive a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority. They fancied themſelves our equals, and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

rendered them inſolent; but the imperious tone, menaces, and blows at once changed their ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and their ideas: their ears, and their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders taught their ſouls to ſhrink back into ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, from which they had for ſome moments fancied themſelves diſengaged.</p>
               <p>The enthuſiaſm of liberty an Engliſhman, feels is never ſo ſtrong as when preſented by ſuch proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects as theſe.

While you enjoy all the eaſe and elegance of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and virtue, your old friend wanders over the world, without a ſingle anchor to hold by, or a friend, except you, to confide in.</p>

               <head>A SHORT ACCOUNT Of the late Mr. MAUPERTUIS.</head>
               <p>MR. Maupertuis, lately deceaſed, was the firſt to whom the Engliſh philoſophers owed their being particularly admired by the reſt of Europe. The romantic ſyſtem of Des Cartes was adapted to the taſte of the ſuperficial and the indolent; the foreign univerſities had embraced it with ardour, and ſuch are ſeldom convinced of their error 'till all others give up ſuch falſe opinions as untenable. The philoſophy of Newton, and the metaphyſics of Locke appeared, but, like all new truths, they were at once received with oppoſition and contempt. The Engliſh, 'tis true, ſtudied, underſtood, and conſequently admired them; it was very different on the continent. Fontenelle, who ſeemed to preſide over the republic of letters, unwilling to acknowlege that all his life had been ſpent in erroneous philoſophy, joined in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal diſapprobation, and the Engliſh philoſophers ſeemed entirely unknown.</p>
               <p>Maupertuis, however, made them his ſtudy; he thought he might oppoſe the phyſics of his country,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0201400800:34"/>
and yet ſtill be a good citizen; he defended our countrymen, wrote in their favour, and, at laſt, as he had truth on his ſide, carried his cauſe. Almoſt all the learning of the Engliſh, 'till very lately, was conveyed in the language of France. The writings of Maupertius ſpread the reputation of his maſter Newton, and by an happy fortune have united his fame with that of our human prodigy.</p>
               <p>The firſt of his performances, openly, in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Newtonian ſyſtem, is his treatiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Sur la figure des Aſtres,</hi> if I remember right; a work at once expreſſive of a deep geometrical knowledge, and the moſt happy manner of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering abſtruſe ſcience with eaſe. This met with violent oppoſition from a people, though fond of novelty in every thing elſe, yet, however, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſcience, attached to antient opinions with bigotry. As the old and the obſtinate fell away, the youth of France embraced the new opinions, and now ſeem more eager to defend Newton than even his countrymen.</p>
               <p>That oddity of character which great men are ſometimes remarkable for, Maupertuis was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titely free from. If we can believe Voltaire, he once attempted to caſtrate himſelf; but whether this be true or no, it is certain he was extremely whimſical. Though born to a large fortune,
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                     <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0201400800:35"/>
antagoniſt for the oppoſite ſex, and therefore it was wiſely ordered, that our ladies ſhould want taſte, leſt their admirers ſhould entirely want reaſon.</p>
               <p>But to confeſs a truth, I do not find they have a greater averſion to fine cloaths than the women of any other country whatſoever. I can't fancy that a ſhopkeeper's wife in Cheapſide has a greater tenderneſs for the fortune of her huſband than a citizen's wife in Paris; or that miſs in a boarding-ſchool is more an oeconomiſt in dreſs than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle in a nunnery.</p>
               <p>Although Paris may be accounted the ſoil in which almoſt every faſhion takes its riſe, its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is never ſo general there as with us. They ſtudy there the happy method of uniting grace and faſhion, and never excuſe a woman for being aukwardly dreſſed, by ſaying her cloaths are made in the mode. A French woman is a perfect archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect in dreſs; ſhe never, with Gothic ignorance, mixes the orders; ſhe never tricks out a ſquabby Doric ſhape, with Corinthian finery; or, to ſpeak without metaphor, ſhe conforms to general faſhion, only when it happens not to be repugnant to private beauty.</p>
               <p>Our ladies, on the contrary, ſeem to have no other ſtandard for grace but the run of the town. If faſhion gives the word, every diſtinction of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0201400800:36"/>
beauty, complexion, or ſtature ceaſes. Sweeping trains, Pruſſian bonnets, and trollopees, as like each other, as if cut from the ſame piece, level all to one ſtandard. The mall, the gardens, and playhouſes are filled with ladies in uniform, and their whole appearance ſhews as little variety or taſte as if their cloaths were beſpoke by the colonel of a marching regiment, or fancied by the ſame artiſt who dreſſes the three battalions of guards.</p>
               <p>But not only ladies of every ſhape and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, but of every age too, are poſſeſſed of this unaccountable paſſion of dreſſing in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. A lady of no quality can be diſtinguiſhed from a lady of ſome quality only by the redneſs of her hands; and a woman of ſixty, maſked, might eaſily paſs for her grand-daughter. I remember, a few days ago, to have walked behind a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, toſſed out in all the gaiety of fifteen; her dreſs was looſe, unſtudied, and ſeemed the reſult of conſcious beauty. I called up all my poetry on this occaſion, and fancied twenty Cupids prepared for execution in every folding of her white negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee. I had prepared my imagination for an angel's face; but what was my mortification to find that the imaginary goddeſs was no other than my couſin Hannah, four years older than myſelf, and I ſhall be ſixty-two the twelfth of next No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0201400800:37"/>After the tranſports of our firſt ſalute were over, I could not avoid running my eye over her whole appearance. Her gown was of cambrick, cut ſhort before, in order to diſcover an high-heeled ſhoe, which was buckled almoſt at the toe. Her cap, if cap it might be called that cap was none, conſiſted of a few bits of cambrick, and flowers of painted paper ſtuck on one ſide of her head. Her boſom, that had felt no hand, but the hand of time, theſe twenty years, roſe, ſuing, but in vain, to be preſſed. I could, indeed, have wiſhed her more than an handkerchief of Paris net to ſhade her beauties; for, as Taſſo ſays of the roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bud, <hi>Quanto ſi moſtra men tanto epiu bella,</hi> I ſhould think her's moſt pleaſing when leaſt diſcovered.</p>
               <p>As my couſin had not put on all this finery for nothing, ſhe was at that time ſallying out to the park, when I had overtaken her. Perceiving, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that I had on my beſt wig, ſhe offered, if I would 'ſquire her there, to ſend home the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Though I trembled for our reception in public, yet I could not, with any civility, refuſe; ſo, to be as gallant as poſſible, I took her hand in my arm, and thus we marched on together.</p>
               <p>When we made our entry at the Park, two antiquated figures, ſo polite and ſo tender as we ſeemed to be, ſoon attracted the eyes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. As we made our way among crowds who
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0201400800:38"/>
were out to ſhew their finery as well as we, wherever we came I perceived we brought good-humour in our train. The polite could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſmiling, and the vulgar burſt out into a horſe laugh at our groteſque figures. Couſin Hannah, who was perfectly conſcious of the rectitude of her own appearance, attributed all this mirth to the oddity of mine; while I as cordially placed the whole to her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Thus, from being two of the beſt-natured creatures alive, before we got half way up the mall, we both began to grow peeviſh, and, like two mice on a ſtring, endeavoured to revenge the impertinence of others upon ourſelves. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am amazed, couſin Jeffery, ſays miſs, that I can never get you to dreſs like a Chriſtian. I knew we ſhould have the eyes of the Park upon us, with your great wig ſo frizzed, and yet ſo beggarly, and your monſtrous muff. I hate  thoſe odious muffs."</q> I could have patiently borne a criticiſm on all the reſt of my equipage; but, as I had always a peculiar veneration for my muff, I could not forbear being piqued a little; and throwing my eyes with a ſpiteful air on her boſom, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I could heartily wiſh, madam, replied I, that, for your ſake, my muff was cut into a tippet."</q>
               </p>
               <p>As my couſin, by this time, was grown heartily aſhamed of her gentleman uſher, and as I was never very fond of any kind of exhibition myſelf, it was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0201400800:39"/>
mutually agreed to retire, for a while, to one of the ſeats, and from that retreat, remark on others as freely as they had remarked on us.</p>
               <p>When ſeated we continued ſilent for ſome time, employed in very different ſpeculations. I regarded the whole company now paſſing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view before me, as drawn out merely for my amuſement. For my entertainment the beauty had all that morning been improving her charms, the beau had put on lace, and the young doctor a big wig, merely to pleaſe me. But quite different were the ſentiments of couſin Hannah; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded every well-dreſſed woman as a victorious rival, hated every face that ſeemed dreſſed in good humour, or wore the appearance of greater happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than her own. I perceived her uneaſineſs, and attempted to leſſen it, by obſerving that there was no company in the Park to-day. To this ſhe readily aſſented; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"and yet, ſays ſhe, it is full enough of ſcrubs of one kind or another."</q> My ſmiling at this obſervation gave her ſpirits to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the bent of her inclination, and now ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to exhibit her ſkill in ſecret hiſtory, as ſhe found me diſpoſed to liſten. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Obſerve, ſays ſhe to me, that old woman in tawdry ſilk, and dreſſed out even beyond the faſhion. That is miſs Biddy Evergreen. Miſs Biddy, it ſeems, has money, and as ſhe conſiders that money was never ſo ſcarce as it is now, ſhe ſeems re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to keep what ſhe has to herſelf. She is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0201400800:40"/>
ugly enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſee; yet, I aſſure you, ſhe has refuſed ſeveral offers, to my own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, within this twelvemonth, Let me ſee, three gentlemen from Ireland who ſtudy the law, two waiting captains, her doctor, and and a Scotch preacher, who had like to have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her off. All her time is paſſed between ſickneſs and finery. Thus ſhe ſpends the whole week in a cloſe chamber, with no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany but her monkey, her apothecary, and cat, and comes dreſſed out to the Park every Sunday, to ſhew her airs, to get new lovers, to catch a new cold, and to make new work for the doctor.</q>

Odious puſs, how ſhe waddles along, with her train two yards behind her! She puts me in mind of my lord Bantam's Indian ſheep, which are obliged to have their monſtrous tails trundled along in a go-cart. For all her airs, it goes to her huſband's heart to ſee four yards of good luteſtring wearing againſt the ground, like one of his knives on a grindſtone. To
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0201400800:41"/>
ſpeak my mind, couſin Jeffery, I never liked thoſe tails; for ſuppoſe a young fellow ſhould be rude, and the lady ſhould offer to ſtep back in a fright, inſtead of retiring, ſhe treads upon her train, and falls fairly on her back; and then you know, couſin,—her cloaths may be ſpoiled.</q>

Every new gown ſhe put on impaired her credit; ſhe ſtill, however, went on, improving her appearance, and leſſening her little fortune, and is now, you ſee, become a belle and a bankrupt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>My couſin was proceeding in her remarks, which were interrupted by the approach of the very lady ſhe had been ſo freely deſcribing.

               <p>I Cannot reſiſt your ſolicitations, though it is poſſible I ſhall be unable to ſatisfy your curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. The polite of every country ſeem to have but one character. A gentleman of Sweden dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers but little, except in trifles, from one of any other country. It is among the vulgar we are to find thoſe diſtinctions which characterize a people, and from them it is that I take my picture of the Swedes.</p>
               <p>Though the Swedes in general appear to languiſh under oppreſſion, which often renders others wicked, or of malignant diſpoſitions, it has not, however, the ſame influence upon them, as they are faithful, civil, and incapable of atrocious
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0201400800:44"/>
crimes. Would you believe that in Sweden high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way robberies are not ſo much as heard of; for my part I have not in the whole country ſeen a gibbet or a gallows. They pay an infinite reſpect to their eccleſiaſtics, whom they ſuppoſe to be the privy counſellors of providence, who, on their part, turn this credulity to their own advantage, and manage their pariſhioners as they pleaſe. In general, however, they ſeldom abuſe their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign authority. Hearkened to as oracles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as the diſpenſers of eternal rewards and puniſhments, they readily influence their hearers into juſtice, and make them practical philoſophers without the pains of ſtudy.</p>
               <p>As to their perſons they are perfectly well made, and the men particularly have a very engaging air. The greateſt part of the boys which I ſaw in the country, had very white hair. They were as beautiful as Cupids, and there was ſomething open and entirely happy in their little chubby faces. The girls, on the contrary, have neither ſuch fair, nor ſuch even complexions, and their features are much leſs delicate, which is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance different from that of almoſt every other country. Beſides this, it is obſerved that the women are generally afflicted with the itch, for which Scania is particularly remarkable. I had an inſtance of this in one of the inns on the road. The hoſteſs was one of the moſt beautiful women I have ever
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0201400800:45"/>
ſeen; ſhe had ſo fine a complexion, that I could not avoid admiring it. But what was my ſurprize when ſhe opened her boſom in order to ſuckle her child, to perceive that ſeat of delight, all covered with this diſagreeable diſtemper. The careleſs manner in which ſhe expoſed to our eyes ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting an object, ſufficiently teſtifies that they regard it as no very extraordinary malady, and ſeem to take no pains to conceal it. Such are the remarks, which probably you may think trifling enough, I have made in my journey to Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm, which, to take it all together, is a large, beautiful, and even populous city.</p>
               <p>The arſenal appears to me one of its greateſt curioſities; it is an handſome ſpacious building, but however illy ſtored with the implements of war. To recompence this defect, they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt filled it with trophies, and other marks of their former military glory. I ſaw there ſeveral chambers filled with Daniſh, Saxon, Poliſh, and Ruffian ſtandards. There was at leaſt enough to ſuffice half a dozen armies; but new ſtandards are more eaſily made than new armies can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted. I ſaw, beſides, ſome very rich furniture, and ſome of the crown jewels of great value, but what principally engaged my attention, and touched me with paſſing melancholy, were the bloody, yet precious ſpoils, of the two greateſt heroes the north ever produced. What I mean
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0201400800:46"/>
are the cloaths in which the great Guſtavus Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, and the intrepid Charles XII. died, by a fate not uſual to kings. The firſt, if I remember, is a ſort of a buff waiſtcoat, made antique faſhion, very plain, and without the leaſt ornaments; the ſecond, which was even more remarkable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted only of a coarſe blue cloth coat, a large hat of leſs value, a ſhirt of coarſe linen, large boots, and buff gloves made to cover a great part of the arm. His ſaddle, his piſtols and his ſword, have nothing in them remarkable, the meaneſt ſoldier was in this reſpect no way inferior to his gallant monarch. I ſhall uſe this opportunity to give you ſome particulars of the life of a man already ſo well known, which I had from perſons who knew him when a child, and who now, by a fate not unuſual to courtiers, ſpend a life of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and retirement, and talk over in raptures all the actions of their old victorious king, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and maſter.</p>
               <p>Courage and inflexible conſtancy formed the baſis of this monarch's character. In his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt years he gave inſtances of both. When he was yet ſcarce ſeven years old, being at dinner with the queen his mother, intending to give a bit of bread to a great dog he was fond of, this hungry animal ſnapt too greedily at the morſel, and bit his hand in a terrible manner. The wound bled copiouſly, but our young hero,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0201400800:47"/>
without offering to cry, or taking the leaſt notice of his misfortune, endeavoured to conceal what had happened, leſt his dog ſhould be brought into trouble, and wrapped his bloody hand in the nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin. The queen perceiving that he did not eat, aſked him the reaſon. He contented himſelf with replying, that he thanked her, he was not hungry. They thought he was taken ill, and ſo repeated their ſolicitations. But all was in vain, though the poor child was already grown pale with the loſs of blood. An officer who attended at table, at laſt perceived it; for Charles would ſooner have died than betrayed his dog, whom he knew intended no injury.</p>
               <p>At another time, when in the ſmall pox, and his caſe appeared dangerous, he grew one day very uneaſy in his bed, and a gentleman who watched him, deſirous of covering him up cloſe, received from the patient a violent box on his ear. Some hours after obſerving the prince more calm, he entreated to know how he had incurred his diſpleaſure, or what he had done to have merited a blow. A blow, replied Charles, I don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any thing of it; I remember, indeed, that I thought myſelf in the battle of Arbela, fighting for Darius, where I gave Alexander a blow, which brought him to the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0201400800:48"/>What great effects might not theſe two quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of courage and conſtancy have produced, had they at firſt received a juſt direction. Charles, with proper inſtruction, thus naturally diſpoſed, would have been the delight and the glory of his age. Happy thoſe princes, who are educated by men who are at once vertuous and wiſe, and have been for ſome time in the ſchool of affliction; who weigh happineſs againſt glory, and teach their royal pupils the real value of fame; who are ever ſhewing the ſuperior dignity of man to that of royalty; that a peaſant who does his duty is a nobler character than a king of even middling reputation. Happy, I ſay, were princes, could ſuch men be found to inſtruct them, but thoſe to whom ſuch an education is generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, are men who themſelves have acted in a ſphere too high to know mankind. Puffed up themſelves with ideas of falſe grandeur, and meaſuring merit by adventitious circumſtances of greatneſs, they generally communicate thoſe fatal prejudices to their pupils, confirm their pride by adulation, or encreaſe their ignorance by teaching them to deſpiſe that wiſdom which is found among the poor.</p>
               <p>But not to moralize when I only intend a Story; what is related of the journies of this prince is no leſs aſtoniſhing. He has ſometimes been on horſeback for four and twenty hours ſucceſſively,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0201400800:49"/>
and thus traverſed the greateſt part of his kingdom. At laſt none of his officers were found capable of following him; he thus conſequently rode the greateſt part of theſe journies quite alone, without taking a moment's repoſe, and without any other ſubſiſtence but a bit of bread. In one of theſe rapid courſes, he underwent an adventure ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar enough. Riding thus poſt one day, all alone, he had the misfortune to have his horſe fall dead under him. This might have embarraſſed an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary man, but it gave Charles no ſort of unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. Sure of finding another horſe, but not equally ſo of meeting with a good ſaddle and piſtols, he ungirds his horſe, claps the whole equipage on his own back, and thus accoutred, marches on to the next inn, which by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was not far off. Entering the ſtable, he here found an horſe entirely to his mind; ſo, without further ceremony, he clapped on his ſaddle and houſing with great compoſure, and was juſt going to mount, when the gentleman who owned the horſe was apprized of a ſtranger's going to ſteal his property out of the ſtable. Upon aſking the king, whom he had never ſeen, bluntly, how he preſumed to meddle with his horſe, Charles coolly replied, ſqueezing in his lips, which was his uſual cuſtom, that he took the horſe becauſe he wanted one; for you ſee, continued he, if I have none, I ſhall be obliged to carry the ſaddle myſelf. This anſwer did not ſeem at all ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0201400800:50"/>
to the gentleman, who inſtantly drew his ſword. In this the king was not much behind hand with him, and to it they were going, when the guards, by this time, came up, and teſtified that ſurprize which was natural, to ſee arms in the hand of a ſubject againſt his king. Imagine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the gentleman was leſs ſurprized than they at his unpremeditated diſobedience. His aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, however, was ſoon diſſipated by the king, who, taking him by the hand, aſſured him he was a brave fellow, and himſelf would take care he ſhould be provided for. This promiſe was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fulfilled; and I have been aſſured the king made him a captain.</p>

               <head>HAPPINESS, In a great Meaſure, Dependant on CONSTITUTION.</head>
               <p>WHEN I reflect on the unambitious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement in which I paſſed the earlier part of my life in the country, I cannot avoid feeling ſome pain in thinking that thoſe happy days are never to return. In that retreat all nature ſeemed capable of affording pleaſure; I then made no refinements on happineſs, but could be pleaſed with the moſt aukward efforts of ruſtic mirth; thought croſs-purpoſes the higheſt ſtretch of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wit, and queſtions and commands the moſt rational amuſement for ſpending the evening. Happy could ſo charming an illuſion ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. I find age and knowledge only contribute to ſour our diſpoſitions. My preſent enjoyments may be more refined, but they are infinitely leſs pleaſing. The pleaſure Garrick gives, can no way compare to that I have received from a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try wag, who imitated a quaker's ſermon. The muſic of Matei is diſſonance to what I felt when our old dairy-maid ſung me into tears with Johnny
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0201400800:53"/>
Armſtrong's Laſt Good Night, or the Cruelty of Barbara Allen.</p>
               <p>Writers of every age have endeavoured to ſhew that pleaſure is in us, and not in the objects of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our amuſement. If the ſoul be happily diſpoſed, every thing becomes a ſubject of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and diſtreſs will almoſt want a name. Every occurrence paſſes in review like the figures of a proceſſion; ſome may be aukward, others ill dreſſed; but none but a fool is for this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with the maſter of the ceremonies.</p>
               <p>I remember to have once ſeen a ſlave in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification in Flanders, who appeared no way touched with his ſituation. He was maimed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day 'till night-fall, and condemned to this for life; yet, with all theſe circumſtances of apparent wretchedneſs, he ſung, would have danced, but that he wanted a leg, and appeared the merrieſt, happieſt man of all the garriſon. What a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal philoſopher was here; an happy conſtitution ſupplied philoſophy, and though ſeemingly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of wiſdom, he was really wiſe. No reading or ſtudy had contributed to diſenchant the fairy land around him. Every thing furniſhed him with an opportunity of mirth; and though ſome thought him from his inſenſibility a fool, he was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0201400800:54"/>
ſuch an ideot as philoſophers might wiſh in vain to imitate.</p>
               <p>They, who like him, can place themſelves on that ſide of the world in which every thing appears in a ridiculous or pleaſing light, will find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in every occurrence to excite their good humour. The moſt calamitous events, either to themſelves or others, can bring no new affliction; the whole world is to them a theatre, on which comedies only are acted. All the buſtle of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm, or the rants of ambition, ſerve only to heighten the abſurdity of the ſcene, and make the humour more poignant. They feel, in ſhort, as little anguiſh at their own diſtreſs, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of others, as the undertaker, though dreſſed in black, feels ſorrow at a funeral.</p>
               <p>Of all the men I ever read of, the famous Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal De Retz poſſeſſed this happineſs of temper in the higheſt degree. As he was a man of gallantry, and deſpiſed all that wore the pedantic appearance of philoſophy, wherever pleaſure was to be ſold, he was generally foremoſt to raiſe the auction. Being an univerſal admirer of the fair ſex, when he found one lady cruel, he generally fell in love with another, from whom he expected a more favourable reception: If ſhe too rejected his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, he never thought of retiring into deſarts, or pining in hopeleſs diſtreſs. He perſuaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0201400800:55"/>
that inſtead of loving the lady, he only fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied he had loved her, and ſo all was well again. When fortune wore her angrieſt look, when he at laſt fell into the power of his moſt deadly enemy Cardinal Mazarine, and was confined a cloſe priſoner in the caſtle of Valenciennes, he never attempted to ſupport his diſtreſs by wiſdom or philoſophy, for he pretended to neither. He laughed at himſelf and his perſecutor, and ſeemed infinitely pleaſed at his new ſituation. In this manſion of diſtreſs, though ſecluded from hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> friends, though denied all the amuſements, and even the conveniencies of life, teized every hour by the impertinence of wretches who were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to guard him, he ſtill retained his good humour, laughed at all their little ſpite, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the jeſt ſo far as to be revenged, by writing the life of his goaler.</p>
               <p>All that philoſophy can teach, is to be ſtubborn or ſullen under misfortunes. The Cardinal's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample will inſtruct us to be merry in circumſtances of the higheſt affliction. It matters not whether our good humour be conſtrued by others into inſenſibility, or even ideotiſm; it is happineſs to ourſelves, and none but a fool would meaſure his ſatiſfaction by what the world thinks of it.</p>
               <p>Dick Wildgooſe was one of the happieſt ſilly fellows I ever knew. He was of the number of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0201400800:56"/>
thoſe good-natured creatures that are ſaid to do no harm to any but themſelves. Whenever Dick fell into any miſery, he uſually called it <hi>ſeeing life.</hi> If his head was broke by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a ſharper, he comforted himſelf by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the Hibernian dialect of the one, or the more faſhionable cant of the other. Nothing came amiſs to Dick. His inattention to money matters had incenſed his father to ſuch a degree, that all the interceſſion of friends in his favour, was fruitleſs. The old gentleman was on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. The whole family, and Dick among the number, gathered around him. I leave my ſecond ſon Andrew, ſaid the expiring miſer, my whole eſtate, and deſire him to be frugal. Andrew, in a ſorrowful tone, as is uſual on theſe occaſions, <hi>Prayed heaven to prolong his life and health to enjoy it himſelf.</hi> I recommend Simon, my third ſon, to the care of his elder brother, and leave him beſide four thouſand pounds. Ah! father, cried Simon, (in great affliction to be ſure) <hi>May heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourſelf.</hi> At laſt, turning to poor Dick; as for you, you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been a ſad dog, you'll never come to good, you'll never be rich, I'll leave you a ſhilling to buy an halter. Ah! father, cries Dick, without any emotion, <hi>May heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourſelf.</hi> This was all the trouble the loſs of fortune gave this thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs imprudent creature. However, the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0201400800:57"/>
of an uncle recompenced the neglect of a father; and Dick is now not only exceſſively good-humoured, but competently rich.</p>
               <p>The world, in ſhort, may cry out at a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt who appears at a ball; at an author who laughs at the public which pronounces him a dunce; at a general who ſmiles at the reproach of the vulgar, or the lady who keeps her good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in ſpite of ſcandal; but ſuch is the wiſeſt behaviour they can poſſibly aſſume; it is certainly a better way to oppoſe calamity by diſſipation, than to take up the arms of reaſon or reſolution to oppoſe it: By the firſt method we forget our miſeries, by the laſt we only conceal them from others; by ſtruggling with misfortunes, we are ſure to receive ſome wounds in the conflict. The only method to come off victorious, is by running away.</p>

               <head>ON OUR THEATRES.</head>
               <p>MAdemoiſelle Clairon, a celebrated actreſs at Paris, ſeems to me the moſt perfect fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male figure I have ever ſeen upon any ſtage. Not, perhaps, that nature has been more liberal of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal beauty to her, than ſome to be ſeen upon our theatres at home. There are actreſſes here who have as much of what connoiſſeurs call ſtatuary grace, by which is meant elegance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected with motion, as ſhe; but they all fall infinitely ſhort of her, when the ſoul comes to give expreſſion to the limbs, and animates every feature.</p>
               <p>Her firſt appearance is exceſſively engaging; ſhe never comes in ſtaring round upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as if ſhe intended to count the benefits of the houſe, or at leaſt to ſee, as well as be ſeen. Her eyes are always, at firſt, intently fixed upon the perſons of the drama, and ſhe lifts them by degrees, with enchanting diffidence, upon the ſpectators. Her firſt ſpeech, or at leaſt the firſt part of it, is delivered with ſcarce any motion of the arm; her hands and her tongue never ſet out together; but the one prepares us for the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0201400800:59"/>
other. She ſometimes begins with a mute, eloquent attitude; but never goes forward all at once with hands, eyes, head, and voice. This obſervation, though it may appear of no importance, ſhould certainly be adverted to; nor do I ſee any one performer (Garrick only excepted) among us, that is not, in this particular, apt to offend. By this ſimple beginning ſhe gives herſelf a power of riſing in the paſſion of the ſcene. As ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, every geſture, every look acquires new violence, till at laſt tranſported, ſhe fills the whole vehemence of the part, and all the idea of the poet.</p>
               <p>Her hands are not alternately ſtretched out, and then drawn in again, as with the ſinging women at Sadler's-wells; they are employed with graceful variety, and every moment pleaſe with new and unexpected eloquence. Add to this, that their motion is generally from the ſhoulder; ſhe never flouriſhes her hands while the upper part of her arm is motionleſs, nor has ſhe the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous appearance, as if her elbows were pinned to her hips.</p>
               <p>But of all the cautions to be given our riſing actreſſes, I would particularly recommend it to them never to take notice of the audience, upon any occaſion whatſoever; let the ſpectators ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud never ſo loudly, their praiſes ſhould paſs,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0201400800:60"/>
except at the end of the epilogue, with ſeeeming inattention. I can never pardon a lady on the ſtage who, when ſhe draws the admiration of the whole audience, turns about to make them a low courteſy for their applauſe. Such a figure no longer continues Belvidera, but at once drops into Mrs. Cibber. Suppoſe a ſober tradeſman, who once a year takes his ſhilling's worth at Drury-lane, in order to be delighted with the figure of a queen, the queen of Sheba for inſtance, or any other queen: This honeſt man has no other idea of the great but from their ſuperior pride and impertinence: Suppoſe ſuch a man placed among the ſpectators, the firſt figure that preſents on the ſtage is the queen herſelf, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and cringing to all the company; how can he fancy her the haughty favourite of king Solomon the wiſe, who appears actually more ſubmiſſive than the wife of his boſom. We are all tradeſmen of a nicer reliſh in this reſpect, and ſuch a conduct muſt diſguſt every ſpectator who loves to have the illuſion of nature ſtrong upon him.</p>
               <p>Yet, while I recommend to our actreſſes a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attention to geſture, I would not have them ſtudy it in the looking-glaſs. This, without ſome precaution, will render their action formal; by too great an intimacy with this, they become ſtiff and affected. People ſeldom improve, when they have no other model but themſelves to copy after.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0201400800:61"/>
I remember to have known a notable performer of the other ſex, who made great uſe of this flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monitor, and yet was one of the ſtiffeſt figures I ever ſaw. I am told his apartment was hung round with looking-glaſs, that he might ſee his perſon twenty times reflected upon entering the room; and I will make bold to ſay, he ſaw twenty very ugly fellows whenever he did ſo.</p>

                  <salute>Dear SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>OF all the praiſes you are pleaſed to beſtow on my trifling Eſſay on General Hiſtory, I can acquieſce only in thoſe which you mention of my impartiality, of my love of truth, and my zeal for the happineſs of ſociety. All my life has been ſpent in contributing to ſpread a ſpirit of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and toleration, and ſuch a ſpirit now ſeems to characteriſe the age. This glorious ſpirit, which animates every enlightened mind, has begun to diffuſe itſelf in this country, where firſt my vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinary conſtitution, and now the charms of tranquility keep me. It is no ſmall example of the progreſs of human reaſon, that my Hiſtory has been printed at Geneva with public approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0201400800:63"/>
in which I have characterized Calvin as a man of a diſpoſition as much more villainous as his underſtanding was more enlightened than that of the reſt of mankind. The death of Servetus appears ſtill abominable. The Dutch bluſh when they recollect their cruelty to Barnevelt. I know not whether the Engliſh yet find any remorſe for theirs to Byng. The attempt and the tortures of Damien have been objected to me as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous with my character of the preſent age. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every man of any figure in the literary world has demanded, Is this the nation which you have drawn in ſo amiable a light? Is this the age which you have deſcribed, as ſuperior to others in wiſdom? To this I anſwer (as I well may) that ſome men are of characters very different from that of their country, or the times they live in. A poor madman, of the dregs of the people, is not a model from which to characterize his country. But, on the other hand, Chatel and Ravillac were poſſeſſed with an epidemic fury, the ſpirit of public fanaticiſm turned their heads; and even ſo far was the age infected, that I have by me an apology for the behaviour of John Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, printed during the trial of this unhappy, but deluded creature. It is quite otherwiſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; Damien's attempt has been looked upon with indignation not only by France, but by all Europe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0201400800:64"/>In the little romantic country in which I reſide, lying along the banks of the Genevan lake, we turn with horror from enormities like theſe. We act here as they ought to act at Paris; we live with tranquillity; we cultivate learning without diviſions or envy. Tavernier obſerves, that the proſpect of Lauſanne from the Genevan lake reſembles that of Conſtantinople; but what pleaſes me more than a proſpect is, that love for the arts which inſpires the generality of its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
               <p>You have not been deceived when it was told you, that Zara, the Prodigal Son, and other plays, have been repreſented here as well as they could have been at Paris: Yet, let not this ſurprize you; they neither know, nor ſpeak any other language here than that of France. Almoſt all the families are of French extraction; and we have as much taſte here as in any part of the world.</p>
               <p>We have not here that low ridiculous hiſtory of the war in 1741, which they have printed at Paris with my name; nor the pretended <hi>Port ſeuille,</hi> where there are ſcarce three ſentences of mine; nor that infamous rhapſody, intituled, The Maid of Orleans, replete with lines the moſt low and ſtupid, that ever eſcaped from ignorance, and with inſolencies the moſt atrocious that ever
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0201400800:65"/>
impudence had courage to avow. We muſt own that there have lately been many enormities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at Paris, with both the dagger and the pen. I conſole myſelf, at being diſtant from my friends, in finding myſelf removed from ſuch enormities as theſe; and I muſt pity that amiable country which can thus produce monſters.</p>

               <head>On the USE of LANGUAGE.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE manner in which moſt writers begin their treatiſes on the Uſe of Language, is generally thus: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Language has been granted to man, in order to diſcover his wants and neceſſities, ſo as to have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by ſociety. Whatever we deſire, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we wiſh, it is but to cloath thoſe deſires or wiſhes in words, in order to fruition; the principal uſe of language, therefore, ſay they, is to expreſs our wants, ſo as to receive a ſpeedy redreſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0201400800:67"/>Such an account as this may ſerve to ſatisfy grammarians and rhetoricians well enough, but men who know the world, maintain very contrary maxims; they hold, and I think with ſome ſhew of reaſon, they hold, that he who beſt knows how to conceal his neceſſities and deſires, is the moſt likely perſon to find redreſs, and that the true uſe of ſpeech is not ſo much to expreſs our wants as to conceal them.</p>
               <p>When we reflect on the manner in which mankind generally confer their favours, we ſhall find that they who ſeem to want them leaſt, are the very perſons who moſt liberally ſhare them. There is ſomething ſo attractive in riches, that the large heap generally collects from the ſmaller; and the poor find as much pleaſure in encreaſing the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous maſs, as the miſer, who owns it, ſees hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in its encreaſe. Nor is there in this any thing repugnant to the laws of true morality. Seneca himſelf allows, that in conferring benefits, the preſent ſhould always be ſuited to the dignity of the receiver. Thus the rich receive large preſents, and are thanked for accepting them. Men of middling ſtations are obliged to be content with preſents ſomething leſs, while the beggar, who may be truly ſaid to want indeed, is well paid if a farthing rewards his warmeſt ſolicitations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0201400800:68"/>Every man who has ſeen the world, and has had his <hi>ups and downs in life,</hi> as the expreſſion is, muſt have frequently experienced the truth of this doctrine, and muſt know that to have much, or to ſeem to have it, is the only way to have more. Ovid finely compares a man of broken fortune to a falling column; the lower it ſinks, the greater weight it is obliged to ſuſtain. Thus, when a man has no occaſion to borrow, he finds numbers willing to lend him. Should he aſk his friend to lend him an hundred pounds, it is poſſible, from the largeneſs of his demand, he may find credit for twenty; but ſhould he humbly only ſue for a trifle, it is two to one whether he might be truſted for two pence. A certain young fellow at George's, whenever he had occaſion to aſk his friend for a guinea, uſed to prelude his requeſt as if he wanted two hundred, and talked ſo familiarly of large ſums, that none could ever think he wanted a ſmall one. The ſame gentleman, whenever he wanted credit for a new ſuit from his taylor, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made the propoſal in laced cloaths; for he found by experience, that if he appeared ſhabby on theſe occaſions, Mr. Lynch had taken an oath againſt truſting; or what was every bit as bad, his foreman was out of the way, and would not be at home theſe two days.</p>
               <p>There can be no inducement to reveal our wants, except to find pity, and by this means relief; but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0201400800:69"/>
before a poor man opens his mind in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, he ſhould firſt conſider whether he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to loſe the eſteem of the perſon he ſolicits, and whether he is willing to give up friendſhip only to excite compaſſion. Pity and friendſhip are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions incompatible with each other, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that both can reſide in any breaſt for the ſmalleſt ſpace, without impairing each other. Friendſhip is made up of eſteem and pleaſure; pity is compoſed of ſorrow and contempt; the mind may for ſome time fluctuate between them, but it can never entertain both together.</p>
               <p>Yet let it not be thought that I would exclude pity from the human mind. There is ſcarce any who are not in ſome degree poſſeſſed of this pleaſing ſoftneſs; but it is at beſt but a ſhort-lived paſſion, and ſeldom affords diſtreſs more than tranſitory aſſiſtance: With ſome it ſcarce laſts from the firſt impulſe till the hand can be put into the pocket; with others it may continue for twice that ſpace, and on ſome of extraordinary ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, I have ſeen it operate for half an hour. But, however, laſt as it will, it generally produces but beggarly effects; and where, from this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive we give an halfpenny, from others we give always pound. In great diſtreſs we ſometimes, it is true, feel the influence of tenderneſs ſtrongly; when the ſame diſtreſs ſolicits a ſecond time, we then feel with diminiſhed ſenſibility, but like the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0201400800:70"/>
repetition of an eccho, every new impulſe becomes weaker, till at laſt our ſenſations loſe every mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſorrow, and degenerate into downright contempt.</p>
               <p>Jack Spindle and I were old acquaintance; but he's gone. Jack was bred in a compting-houſe, and his father dying juſt as he was out of his time, left him an handſome fortune, and many friends to adviſe with. The reſtraint in which he had been brought up, had thrown a gloom upon his temper, which ſome regarded as an habitual pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and from ſuch conſiderations, he had every day repeated offers of friendſhip. Thoſe who had money, were ready to offer him their aſſiſtance that way; and they who had daughters, frequently, in the warmth of affection, adviſed him to marry. Jack, however, was in good circumſtances; he wanted neither money, friends, nor a wife, and therefore modeſtly declined their propoſals.</p>
               <p>Some errors in the management of his affairs, and ſeveral loſſes in trade, ſoon brought Jack to a different way of thinking; and he at laſt thought it his beſt way to let his friends know that their offers were at length acceptable. His firſt addreſs was therefore to a ſcrivener, who had formerly made him frequent offers of money and friendſhip, at a time when, perhaps, he knew thoſe offers would have been refuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0201400800:71"/>Jack, therefore, thought he might uſe his old friend without any ceremony, and as a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of not being refuſed, requeſted the uſe of an hundred guineas for a few days, as he juſt then had an occaſion for money. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And pray, Mr. Spindle, replied the ſcrivener, do you want all this money?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Want it, Sir, ſays the other, if I did not want it, I ſhould not have aſked it."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am ſorry for that, ſays the friend; for thoſe who want money when they come to borrow, will want money when they ſhould come to pay. To ſay the truth, Mr. Spindle, money is money now-a-days. I believe it is all ſunk in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the ſea, for my part; and he that has got a little, is a fool if he does not keep what he has got."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Not quite diſconcerted by this refuſal, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer was reſolved to apply to another, whom he knew to be the very beſt friend he had in the world. The gentleman whom he now addreſſed, received his propoſal with all the affability that could be expected from generous friendſhip. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Let me ſee, you want an hundred guineas, and pray, dear Jack, would not fifty anſwer."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>If you have but fifty to ſpare, Sir, I muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</hi>"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Fifty to ſpare, I do not ſay that, for I believe I have but twenty about me."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Then I muſt borrow the other thirty from ſome other friend.</hi>"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And pray, replied the friend, would
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0201400800:72"/>
it not be the beſt way to borrow the whole money from that other friend, and then one note will ſerve for all, you know. Lord, Mr. Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, make no ceremony with me at any time; you know I'm your friend, and when you chuſe a bit of dinner or ſo.——You, Tom, ſee the the gentleman down. You wont forget to dine with us now and then. Your very humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Diſtreſſed, but not diſcouraged at this treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was at laſt reſolved to find that aſſiſtance from love, which he could not have from friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Miſs Jenny Diſmal had a fortune in her own hands, and ſhe had already made all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances that her ſex's modeſty would permit. He made his propoſal therefore with confidence, but ſoon perceived, <hi>No bankrupt ever found the fair one kind.</hi> Miſs Jenny and Maſter Billy Galloon were lately fallen deeply in love with each other, and the whole neighbourhood thought it would ſoon be a match.</p>
               <p>Every day now began to ſtrip Jack of his former finery; his cloaths flew piece by piece to the pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broker's, and he ſeemed at length equipped in the genuine mourning of antiquity. But ſtill he thought himſelf ſecure from ſtarving, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs invitations he had received to dine, even after his loſſes, were yet unanſwered; he was therefore now reſolved to accept of a dinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0201400800:73"/>
he wanted one; and in this manner he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually lived among his friends a whole week with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being openly affronted. The laſt place I ſaw poor Jack was at the Rev. Dr. Goſling's. He had, as he fancied, juſt nicked the time, for he came in as the cloth was laying. He took a chair without being deſired, and talked for ſome time without being attended to. He aſſured the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that nothing procured ſo good an appetite as a walk to White Conduit-houſe, where he had been that morning. He looked at the table-cloth, and praiſed the figure of the damaſk; talked of a feaſt where he had been the day before, but that the veniſon was over done. All this, however, procured the poor creature no invitation, and he was not yet ſufficiently hardened to ſtay without being aſked; wherefore, finding the gentleman of the houſe inſenſible to all his fetches, he thought proper, at laſt, to retire, and mend his appetite by a walk in the Park.</p>
               <p>You then, O ye beggars of my acquaintance, whether in rags or lace; whether in Kent-ſtreet or the Mall; whether at the Smyrna or St. Giles's, might I adviſe as a friend, never ſeem in want of the favour which you ſolicit. Apply to every paſſion but pity, for redreſs. You may find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from vanity, from ſelf-intereſt, or from ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, but ſeldom from compaſſion. The very eloquence of a poor man is diſguſting; and that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0201400800:74"/>
mouth which is opened even for flattery, is ſeldom expected to cloſe without a petition.</p>
               <p>If then you would ward off the gripe of poverty, pretend to be a ſtranger to her, and ſhe will at leaſt uſe you with ceremony. Hear not my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but that of Offellus. If you be caught din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a halfpenny porrenger of peaſe ſoup and potatoes, praiſe the wholeſomeneſs of your frugal repaſt. You may obſerve, that Dr. Cheyne has preſcribed peaſe broth for the gravel, hint that you are not one of thoſe who are always making a god of your belly. If you are obliged to wear a flimſy ſtuff in the midſt of winter, be the firſt to remark that ſtuffs are very much worn at Paris. If there be found ſome irreparable defects in any part of your equipage, which cannot be concealed by all the arts of ſitting croſs-legged, coaxing, or derning, ſay, that neither you nor Sampſon Gideon were ever very fond of dreſs. Or if you be a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, hint that Plato or Seneca are the taylors you chooſe to employ; aſſure the company that man ought to be content with a bare covering, ſince what now is ſo much the pride of ſome, was formerly our ſhame. Horace will give you a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin ſentence fit for the occaſion,
<q>Toga defendere frigus quamvis craſſa queat.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0201400800:75"/>In ſhort, however caught, do not give up, but aſcribe to the frugality of your diſpoſition what others might be apt to attribute to the narrowneſs of your circumſtances, and appear rather to be a miſer than a beggar. To be poor, and to ſeem poor, is a certain method never to riſe. Pride in the great is hateful, in the wiſe it is ridiculous; <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly pride</hi> is the only ſort of vanity I can excuſe.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF HYPASIA.</head>
               <p>MAN, when ſecluded from ſociety, is not a more ſolitary being than the woman who leaves the duties of her own ſex to invade the privileges of ours. She ſeems, in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, like one in baniſhment; ſhe appears like a neutral being between the ſexes; and tho' ſhe may have the admiration of both, ſhe finds true happineſs from neither.</p>
               <p>Of all the ladies of antiquity, I have read of none who was ever more juſtly celebrated than the beautiful Hypaſia, the daughter of Leon the philoſopher. This moſt accompliſhed of women was born at Alexandria, in the reign of Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius the younger. Nature was never more laviſh of its gifts than it had been to her, endued as ſhe was with the moſt exalted underſtanding, and the happieſt turn to ſcience. Education compleated what nature had begun, and made her the prodigy not only of her age, but the glory of her ſex.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0201400800:77"/>From her father ſhe learned geometry and aſtronomy; ſhe collected from the converſation and ſchools of the other philoſophers, for which Alexandria was at that time famous, the principles of the reſt of the ſciences.</p>
               <p>What cannot be conquered by natural penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a paſſion for ſtudy? The boundleſs know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which at that period of time was required to form the character of a philoſopher no way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged her; ſhe delivered herſelf up to the ſtudy of Ariſtotle and Plato, and ſoon not one in all Alexandria underſtood ſo perfectly as ſhe, all the difficulties of theſe two philoſophers.</p>
               <p>But not their ſyſtems alone, but thoſe of every other ſect were quite familiar to her; and to this knowledge ſhe added that of polite learning, and the art of oratory. All the learning which it was poſſible for the human mind to contain, being joined to a moſt enchanting eloquence, rendered this lady the wonder not only of the populace, who eaſily admire, but of philoſophers themſelves, who are ſeldom fond of admiration.</p>
               <p>The city of Alexandria was every day crowded with ſtrangers, who came from all parts of Greece and Aſia to ſee and hear her. As for the charms of her perſon, they might not probably have been mentioned, did ſhe not join to a beauty the moſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0201400800:78"/>
ſtriking, a virtue that might repreſs the moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming; and though in the whole capital, famed for charms, there was not one who could equal her in beauty; though in a city, the reſort of all the learning then exiſting in the world, there was not one who could equal her in knowledge; yet, with ſuch accompliſhments, Hypaſia was the moſt modeſt of her ſex. Her reputation for vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was not leſs than her virtues; and though, in a city divided between two factions, though viſited by the wits and the philoſophers of the age, calumny never dared to ſuſpect her morals, or attempt her character. Both the Chriſtians and the Heathens who have tranſmitted her hiſtory and her misfortunes, have but one voice, when they ſpeak of her beauty, her knowledge, and her virtue. Nay, ſo much harmony reigns in their accounts of this prodigy of perfection, that, in ſpite of the oppoſition of their faith, we ſhould never have been able to judge of what religion was Hypaſia, were we not informed, from other circumſtances, that ſhe was an heathen. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had taken ſo much pains in forming her, that we are almoſt induced to complain of its not having endeavoured to make her a Chriſtian; but from this complaint we are deterred by a thouſand contrary obſervations, which lead us to reverence its inſcrutable myſteries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0201400800:79"/>This great reputation which ſhe ſo juſtly was poſſeſſed of, was at laſt, however, the occaſion of her ruin.</p>
               <p>The perſon who then poſſeſſed the patriarchate of Alexandria was equally remarkable for his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, cruelty, and pride. Conducted by an ill-grounded zeal for the Chriſtian religion, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps deſirous of augmenting his authority in the city, he had long meditated the baniſhment of the Jews. A difference ariſing between them and the Chriſtians with reſpect to ſome public games, ſeemed to him a proper juncture for putting his ambitious deſigns into execution. He found no difficulty in exciting the people, naturally diſpoſed to revolt. The prefect, who at that time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the city, interpoſed on this occaſion, and thought it juſt to put one of the chief creatures of the patriarch to the torture, in order to diſcover the firſt promoter of the conſpiracy. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, enraged at the injuſtice he thought of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to his character and dignity, and piqued at the protection which was offered to the Jews, ſent for the chiefs of the ſynagogue, and enjoined them to renounce their deſigns, upon pain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring his higheſt diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Jews, far from fearing his menaces, excited new tumults, in which ſeveral citizens had the misfortune to fall. The patriarch could no longer
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0201400800:80"/>
contain; at the head of a numerous body of Chriſtians, he flew to the ſynagogues, which he demoliſhed, and drove the Jews from a city, of which they had been poſſeſſed ſince the times of Alexander the great. It may be eaſily imagined that the perfect could not behold, without pain, his juriſdiction thus inſulted, and the city deprived of a number of its moſt induſtrious inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The affair was therefore brought before the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. The patriarch complained of the exceſſes of the Jews, and the prefect of the outrages of the patriarch. At this very juncture, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred monks of mount Nitria, imagining the life of their chief to be in danger, and that their religion was threatened in his fall, flew into the city with ungovernable rage, attacked the prefect in the ſtreets, and not content with loading him with reproaches, wounded him in ſeveral places.</p>
               <p>The citizens had by this time notice of the fury of the monks; they, therefore, aſſembled in a body, put the monks to flight, ſeized on him who had been found throwing a ſtone, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him to the prefect, who cauſed him to be put to death without farther delay.</p>
               <p>The patriarch immediately ordered the dead body, which had been expoſed to view, to be taken down, procured for it all the pomp and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0201400800:81"/>
rites of burial, and went even ſo far as himſelf to pronounce the funeral oration, in which he claſſed a ſeditious monk among the martyrs. This conduct was by no means generally approved of; the moſt moderate even among the Chriſtians per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and blamed his indiſcretion; but he was now too far advanced to retire. He had made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral overtures towards a reconciliation with the prefect, which not ſucceeding, he bore all thoſe an implacable hatred whom he imagined to have any hand in traverſing his deſigns; but Hypaſia was particularly deſtined to ruin. She could not find pardon, as ſhe was known to have a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined friendſhip for the prefect; wherefore the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace were incited againſt her. <hi>Peter,</hi> a reader of the principal church, one of thoſe vile ſlaves by which men in power are too frequently attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wretches ever ready to commit any crime which they hope may render them agreeable to their employer; this fellow, I ſay, attended by a crowd of villains, waited for Hypaſia, as ſhe was returning from a viſit, at her own door, ſeized her as ſhe was going in, and dragged her to one of the churches called Ceſarea, where, ſtripping her in the moſt inhuman manner, they exerciſed the moſt inhuman cruelties upon her, cut her into pieces, and burnt her remains to aſhes. Such was the end of Hypaſia, the glory of her own ſex, and the aſtoniſhment of ours.</p>

               <head>ON JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY.</head>
               <p>LYSIPPUS is a man whoſe greatneſs of ſoul the whole world admires. His gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity is ſuch, that it prevents a demand, and ſaves the receiver the trouble and the confuſion of a requeſt. His liberality alſo does not oblige more by its greatneſs, than by his inimitable grace in giving. Sometimes he even diſtributes his bounties to ſtrangers, and has been known to do good offices to thoſe who profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves his enemies. All the world are unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the praiſe of his generoſity; there is only one ſort of people, who complain of his conduct. Lyſippus does not pay his debts.</p>
               <p>It is no difficult matter to account for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſo ſeemingly incompatible with itſelf. There is greatneſs in being generous, and there is only ſimple juſtice in ſatisfying his creditors. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity is the part of a ſoul raiſed above the vulgar. There is in it ſomething of what we admire in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0201400800:83"/>
heroes, and praiſe with a degree of rapture. Juſtice, on the contrary, is a mere mechanic virtue, only fit for tradeſmen, and what is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by every broker in Change Alley.</p>
               <p>In paying his debts a man barely does his duty, and it is an action attended with no ſort of glory. Should Lyſippus ſatisfy his creditors, who would be at the pains of telling it to the world. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity is a virtue of a very different complexion. It is raiſed above duty, and from its elevation attracts the attention, and the praiſes of us little mortals below.</p>
               <p>In this manner do men generally reaſon upon juſtice and generoſity. The firſt is deſpiſed, though a virtue eſſential to the good of ſociety, and the other attracts our eſteem, which too frequently proceeds from an impetuoſity of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, rather directed by vanity than reaſon. Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus is told that his banker aſks a debt of forty pounds, and that a diſtreſſed acquaintance peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the ſame ſum. He gives it without heſitating to the latter; for he demands as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour what the former requires as a debt.</p>
               <p>Mankind in general are not ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the import of the word Juſtice: It is commonly believed to conſiſt only in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe duties to which the laws of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0201400800:84"/>
ſociety can oblige us. This I allow is ſometimes the import of the word, and in this ſenſe juſtice is diſtinguiſhed from equity; but there is a juſtice ſtill more extenſive, and which can be ſhewn to embrace all the virtues united.</p>
               <p>Juſtice may be defined, that virtue which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels us to give to every perſon what is his due. In this extended ſenſe of the word, it comprehends the practice of every virtue which reaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, or ſociety ſhould expect. Our duty to our maker, to each other, and to ourſelves, are fully anſwered, if we give them what we owe them. Thus juſtice, properly ſpeaking, is the only virtue, and all the reſt have their origin in it.</p>
               <p>The qualities of candour, fortitude, charity, and generoſity, for inſtance, are not in their own nature, virtues; and, if ever they deſerve the title, it is owing only to juſtice, which impels and directs them. Without ſuch a moderator, candour might become indiſcretion, fortitude obſtinacy, charity imprudence, and generoſity miſtaken profuſion.</p>
               <p>A diſintereſted action, if it be not conducted by juſtice, is at beſt indifferent in its nature, and not unfrequently even turns to vice. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of ſociety, of preſents, of entertainments,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0201400800:85"/>
and the other helps to chearfulneſs, are actions merely indifferent, when not repugnant to a better method of diſpoſing of our ſuperfluities, but they become vicious when they obſtruct or exhauſt our abilities from a more virtuous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our circumſtances.</p>
               <p>True generoſity is a duty as indiſpenſibly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as thoſe impoſed upon us by law. It is a rule impoſed upon us by reaſon, which ſhould be the ſovereign law of a rational being. But this generoſity does not conſiſt in obeying every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of humanity, in following blind paſſion for our guide, and impairing our circumſtances by preſent benefactions, ſo as to render us incapable of future ones.</p>
               <p>Miſers are generally characterized as men without honour, or without humanity, who live only to accumulate, and to this paſſion ſacrifice every other happineſs. They have been deſcribed as madmen, who, in the midſt of abundance, baniſh every pleaſure, and make, from imaginary wants, real neceſſities. But few, very few, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to this exaggerated picture; and, perhaps, there is not one in whom all theſe circumſtances are found united. Inſtead of this, we find the ſober and the induſtrious branded by the vain and the idle, with this odious appellation. Men who, by frugality and labour, raiſe themſelves above
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0201400800:86"/>
their equals, and contribute their ſhare of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to the common ſtock.</p>
               <p>Whatever the vain or the ignorant may ſay, well were it for ſociety had we more of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter amongſt us. In general, theſe cloſe men are found at laſt the true benefactors of ſociety. With an avaricious man we ſeldom loſe in our dealings, but too frequently in our commerce with prodigality.</p>
               <p>A French prieſt, whoſe name was Godinot, went for a long time by the name of the Griper. He refuſed to relieve the moſt apparent wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and by a ſkilful management of his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, had the good fortune to acquire immenſe ſums of money. The inhabitants of Rheims, who were his fellow-citizens, deteſted him, and the populace, who ſeldom love a miſer, wherever he went, received him with contempt. He ſtill, however, continued his former ſimplicity of life, his amazing and unremitted frugality. This good man had long perceived the wants of the poor in the city, particularly, in having no water but what they were obliged to buy at an advanced price; wherefore, that whole fortune, which he had been amaſſing, he laid out in an aqueduct, by which he did the poor more uſeful and laſting ſervice, than if he had diſtributed his whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in charity every day at his door.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0201400800:87"/>Among men long converſant with books, we too frequently find thoſe miſplaced virtues, of which I have been now complaining. We find the ſtudious animated with a ſtrong paſſion, for the great virtues, as they are miſtakenly called, and utterly forgetful of the ordinary ones. The declamations of philoſophy are generally rather exhauſted on theſe ſupererogatory duties, than on ſuch as are indiſpenſably neceſſary. A man, therefore, who has taken his ideas of mankind from ſtudy alone, generally comes into the world with an heart melting at every fictitious diſtreſs. Thus he is induced by miſplaced liberality, to put himſelf into the indigent circumſtances of the perſon he relieves.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this paper with the advice of one of the Ancients, to a young man, whom he ſaw giving away all his ſubſtance to pretended diſtreſs. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"It is poſſible, that the perſon you relieve, may be an honeſt man; and I know, that you, who relieve him, are ſuch. You ſee, then, by your generoſity, you only rob a man, who is certainly deſerving, to beſtow it on one who may poſſibly be a rogue. And while you are unjuſt in rewarding uncertain merit, you are doubly guilty by ſtripping yourſelf."</q>

               <head>ON WIT. By VOLTAIRE.</head>
               <p>WIT ſeems to be one of thoſe undetermined ſounds to which we affix ſcarce any preciſe idea. It is ſomething more than judgment, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, taſte, talent, penetration, grace, delicacy, and yet it partakes ſomewhat of each. It may be properly defined ingenious reaſon. It is one of thoſe general terms which always want another word to determine their ſignification; and when we hear ſuch a work praiſed for being witty, ſuch a man applauded for wit, it is but juſt to aſk of what ſort</p>
               <p>Thus Corneille with ſublimity, and Boileau with exactneſs; Fontaine with ſimplicity, and Bruyere by being natural, are all reckoned men of wit, yet each differs from the other; and ſtill more from ſome philoſophers, who may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted witty men, who join ſagacity to imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>They who deſpiſe the Genius of Ariſtotle (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being contented with rejecting his Phyſics
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0201400800:89"/>
only, which cannot be good, as he had but few experiments to direct them) will be much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to find in his rhetoric the manner of ſaying things wittily. He informs us there, that the art does not conſiſt in ſimply uſing the proper term, which offers to the imagination nothing new. We ought, ſays he, rather to employ a metaphor, or a figure, the ſenſe of which muſt be clear, and the expreſſion energetic.</p>
               <p>Of this he gives ſeveral examples, and, among others, the expreſſion of Pericles, in talking of a battle in which the moſt beautiful of the youth of Athens were ſlain, <hi>The year has been deprived of its ſpring.</hi> He adds, that the thought alſo ſhould have the grace of novelty. The perſon who firſt, to expreſs how pleaſures were generally attended with pain, made uſe of the ſimile of roſes being gathered among thorns, had wit. But it is otherwiſe with thoſe who repeat it after him.</p>
               <p>But a metaphor is not always the wittieſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſing a thing with ſpirit, a great deal conſiſts in an unexpected turn, in leaving us to underſtand, without trouble, a part of the poet's meaning. This is ſo much the more pleaſing, as it ſeems an indirect compliment to the reader, and ſhews his wit, as well as that of the Poet. Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, allegory, compariſon, each furniſhes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive field of ingenuity; hiſtory, fable, and the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0201400800:90"/>
effects of nature, furniſh matter to a well-regulated imagination, that can never be exhauſted.</p>
               <p>Let us then conſider in what Places wit ſhould be admitted. It ſeems pretty manifeſt, that, in works of dignity, it ſhould be uſed with caution, as it is only, at beſt, an ornament. The great art is in the proper timing this ornament. A fine thought, a juſt or elegant compariſon, are faults, when reaſon only, or when paſſion ſhould ſpeak, and particularly where the ſubject is intereſting. Uſing it in ſuch circumſtances as theſe, ſhould not be called falſe wit (as Addiſon commonly expreſſes it;) but wit diſplaced, and every miſplaced beauty is rather a defect. This is a fault in which Virgil never tranſgreſſes, and with which Taſſo may be ſometimes reproached, all admirable as he is at other times. This error generally ariſes from an author's exuberance; filled with ideas of different kinds, he is deſirous of ſhewing himſelf, when he ought only to exhibit his perſonages. The beſt method of knowing the true uſe to be made of wit is, by reading the ſmall number of good works, both in the learned languages, and in our own.</p>
               <p>Falſe wit, as I have already hinted, is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from diſplaced wit. This is not only a falſe thought, but it is generally far-fetched alſo. A man of ſome wit, who formerly abridged
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0201400800:91"/>
Homer in French verſe, imagined he added beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the old ſimple bard, in ſometimes lending him embelliſhments. On the reconciling Achilles with Agamemnon, he thus flouriſhes it:
<q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Tout le camp s'ecria dans une joie extrème</l>
                        <l>Que ne vaincra t-il point? Il s'eſt vaincu lui même!</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>The ſhouting army cry'd with joy extreme,</l>
                        <l>He ſure muſt conquer, who himſelf can tame!</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>His taming himſelf does by no means imply his conquering others; but this is not the abſurdity alone, but in making the army, as if by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, join in a far-fetched obſervation. If this ſhocks the reader of nice diſcernment, how much more ſo muſt all thoſe forced expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, cold yet ſtiffened alluſions, and bloated nothings diſpleaſe, which are found in great plenty in works of otherwiſe real merit. How can we bear to hear a mathematician ſay, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If Saturn ſhould happen to be removed, the remoteſt of his ſatellites would probably take his place, ſince great princes always keep their ſucceſſors at a diſtance."</q> It is intolerable, when ſpeaking of Hercules underſtanding phyſicks, to ſay that there was no reſiſting a philoſopher of his force. The deſire of ſparkling and ſurpriſing is too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the cauſe of exceſſes of this kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0201400800:92"/>This trifling vanity has alſo produced the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon words in every language, which is the worſt ſort of falſe wit.</p>
               <p>Falſe taſte is very different from falſe wit, as the latter always proceeds from affectation, from an effort to go wrong; on the contrary, the other is an habit of going wrong without deſign, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, as if by inſtinct, ſome bad, though eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed model. The incoherent exuberance of an oriental imagination is a falſe taſte, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper example to imitate: however, they more frequently tranſgreſs in this reſpect, rather from a poverty than a copiouſneſs of real genius. Falling ſtars, ſplitting mountains, rivers flowing to their ſources, the ſun and moon diſſolving, falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural compariſons, and nature every where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated, form the character of theſe writers; and this ariſes from their never, in theſe countries, being permitted to ſpeak in public. True elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence has never been cultivated there, and it is much eaſier to write in a turgid ſtrain, than with eaſe and delicate ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>In a word, falſe wit is entirely the oppoſite of the Eaſtern manner; the man of falſe wit deſires to ſay in riddles, what others have ſpoken natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. He deſires to unite ideas the moſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible, to divide thoſe which nature has united. To catch unnatural ſimilitudes, without diſcretion
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0201400800:93"/>
to unite pleaſantry with what is ſerious, to mix great and little images together, and to confuſe inſtead of ſatisfying the imagination.</p>
               <p>But perſpicuity is not the only part of ſtile in which falſe wit is not conſpicuous, we are at the ſame time too fond of embelliſhment. In our moſt applauded productions there is ſcarce a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which is not loaded with unneceſſary orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, though it may add grace to a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, generally diſunites the force of a paragraph. The attention, as in Gothic architecture is ſplit upon a number of minute elegances, which, though each are ſeparately pretty, diminiſh the force of the whole.</p>
               <p>Theſe are faults that ſeem to characterize the writings of the age; to theſe every author who would be admired muſt conform. With theſe faults he is ſure of immediate applauſe, though frequently ſcarce allowed a reading. We have ſeen many a writer, of late, make his appearance with theſe qualifications, inſtead of merit; we have ſeen him read by a few, praiſed by all, and ſoon forgotten.</p>
               <p>I have been often at a loſs, whether to aſcribe the decline of taſte in a nation, to the reader or the writer. Perhaps both are in fault; the one ſatiated with varied inſtances of perfection, grows
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0201400800:94"/>
whimſical, deſires ſomething new, and miſtakes change for improvement. The other, willing to avoid the character of an imitator, borrows peculiarities from affectation, and becomes origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal only in trifles. In ſhort, it is as difficult now among ſuch a number of candidates, to catch the attention without theſe oddities of ſtile, as to be remarkable in a crowd without ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity in dreſs and behaviour.</p>
               <p>But theſe are generally fleeting modes, which are introduced by the great, brought up to pleaſe for a day, ſoon to be diſplaced by others, which have the advantages of being more new to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them. The literary republic, however, will never ſuffer real injury from ſuch; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pleaſes from its novelty alone, can never pleaſe long. Not from theſe, then, but from the compilers and commentators of the day, is literature to expect the mortal blow; from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, who have no claim but their induſtry for our applauſe; from laborious drones, who write through folios, but do not think through a page.</p>

               <p>THE Spaniſh nation has, for many centuries paſt, been remarkable for the groſſeſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in polite literature, eſpecially in point of natural philoſophy; a ſcience ſo uſeful to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that her neighbours have ever eſteemed it a matter of the greateſt importance, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by repeated experiments, to ſtrike a light out of the chaos, in which truth ſeemed to be confounded. Their curioſity, in this reſpect, was ſo indifferent, that, though they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered new worlds, they were at a loſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the phoenomena of their own, and their pride ſo unaccountable, that they diſdained to borrow from others that inſtruction, which their natural indolence permitted them not to acquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0201400800:97"/>It gives me, however, a ſecret ſatisfaction, to behold an extraordinary genius now exiſting in that nation, whoſe ſtudious endeavours ſeem cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to undeceive the ſuperſtitious, and inſtruct the ignorant: I mean the celebrated Padre Freijo. In unravelling the myſteries of nature, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining phyſical experiments, he takes an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of diſplaying the concurrence of ſecond cauſes, in thoſe very wonders which the vulgar aſcribe to ſuper-natural influence.</p>
               <p>An example of this kind happened a few years ago, in a ſmall town of the Kingdom of Valencia.

The ſun, it ſeems, which had been for ſome minutes under a cloud, had begun to ſhine on a large crucifix, that ſtood on the middle of the altar, ſtudded with ſeveral precious ſtones. The reflexion from theſe, and from the diamond eyes of ſome ſilver ſaints, ſo dazzed the multitude, that they unanimouſly cried out, A miracle! a miracle! whilſt the prieſt at the altar, with ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſternation, continued his heavenly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Padre Freijo ſoon diſſipated the charm, by tying his handkerchief round the head of one of the ſtatues, for which he was arraigned by the inquiſition; whoſe flames, however, he has had the good fortune hitherto to eſcape.</p>

Their fame is diffuſed in a very wide circle, that of ſome as far as Iſlington, and ſome yet farther ſtill; while mine, I ſincerely believe, has hardly travelled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſound of Bow-bell; and while the works of others fly like unpinioned ſwans, I find my own move as heavily as a new-plucked gooſe.</p>

                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0201400800:99"/>Still, however, I have as much pride as they who have ten times as many readers. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to repeat all the agreeable deluſions in which a diſappointed author is apt to find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. I conclude, that what my reputation wants in extent, is made up by its ſolidity. <hi>Minus juvat Gloria lata quam magna.</hi> I have great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in conſidering the delicacy and diſcernment of thoſe readers I have, and in aſcribing my want of popularity to the ignorance or inattention of thoſe I have not. All the world may forſake an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but vanity will never forſake him.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding ſo ſincere a confeſſion, I was once induced to ſhew my indignation againſt the public, by diſcontinuing my endeavours to pleaſe; and was bravely reſolved, like Raleigh, to vex them, by burning my manuſcript in a paſſion. Upon recollection, however, I conſidered what ſet or body of people would be diſpleaſed at my raſhneſs. The ſun, after ſo ſad an accident, might ſhine next morning as bright as uſual; men might laugh and ſing the next day, and tranſact buſineſs as before, and not a ſingle creature feel any regret but myſelf.</p>
               <p>I reflected upon the ſtory of a miniſter, who, in the reign of Charles II. upon a certain occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, reſigned all his poſts, and retired into the country in a fit of reſentment. But as he had not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0201400800:100"/>
given the world entirely up with his ambition, he ſent a meſſenger to town, to ſee how the courtiers would bear his reſignation. Upon the meſſenger's return, he was aſked whether there appeared any commotions at court? To which he replied, There were very great ones. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Ay, ſays the miniſter, I knew my friends would make a buſtle; all petitioning the king for my reſtoration, I preſume."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"No, Sir, replied the meſſenger, they are only petitioning his majeſty to be put in your place."</q> In the ſame manner, ſhould I retire in indignation, inſtead of having Apollo in mourning, or the Muſes in a fit of the ſpleen; inſtead of having the learned world apoſtrophiſing at my untimely deceaſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps all Grub-ſtreet might laugh at my fall, and ſelf-approving dignity might never be able to ſhield me from ridicule. In ſhort, I am reſolved to write on, if it were only to ſpite them. If the preſent generation will not hear my voice, hearken, O poſterity, to you I call, and from you I expect redreſs! What rapture will it not give to have the Scaligers, Daciers, and Warbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of future times commenting with admiration upon every line I now write, working away thoſe ignorant creatures who offer to arraign my merit with all the virulence of learned reproach. Ay, my friends, let them feel it; call names; never ſpare them; they deſerve it all, and ten times more. I have been told of a critic, who was crucified, at the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0201400800:101"/>
command of another, to the reputation of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. That, no doubt, was more than poetical juſtice, and I ſhall be perfectly content if thoſe who criticiſe me are only clapped in the pillory, kept fifteen days upon bread and water, and obliged to run the gantlope through Pater noſter Row. The truth is, I can expect happineſs from poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity either way. If I write ill, happy in being forgotten; if well, happy in being remembered with reſpect.</p>
               <p>Yet, conſidering things in a prudential light, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I was miſtaken in deſigning my paper as an agreeable relaxation to the ſtudious, or an help to converſation among the gay; inſtead of addreſſing it to ſuch, I ſhould have written down to the taſte and apprehenſion of the many, and ſought for reputation on the broad road. Literary fame I now find like religious, generally begins among the vulgar. As for the polite, they are ſo very polite, as never to applaud upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. One of theſe, with a face ſcrewed up into affectation, tells you, that fools may <hi>admire,</hi> but men of ſenſe only <hi>approve.</hi> Thus, leſt he ſhould riſe into rapture at any thing new, he keeps down every paſſion but pride and ſelf-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; approves with phlegm, and the poor author is damned in the taking a pinch of ſnuff. Another has written a book himſelf, and being condemned for a dunce, he turns a ſort of king's
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0201400800:102"/>
evidence in criticiſm, and now becomes the terror of every offender. A third, poſſeſſed of full-grown reputation, ſhades off every beam of favour from thoſe who endeavour to grow beneath him, and keeps down that merit, which, but for his influence, might riſe into equal eminence. While others, ſtill worſe, peruſe old books for their amuſement, and new books only to condemn; ſo that the public ſeem heartily ſick of all but the buſineſs of the day, and read every thing new with as little attention as they examine the faces of the paſſing crowd.</p>
               <p>From theſe conſiderations I was once determined to throw off all connexions with taſte, and fairly addreſs my countrymen in the ſame engaging ſtyle and manner with other periodical pamphlets, much more in vogue than probably mine ſhall ever be. To effect this, I had thoughts of changing the title into that of the ROYAL BEE, the ANTI-GALLICAN BEE, or the BEE's MAGAZINE. I had laid in a proper ſtock of popular topicks, ſuch as encomiums on the king of Pruſſia, invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives againſt the queen of Hungary and the French, the neceſſity of a militia, our undoubted ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the ſeas, reflections upon the preſent ſtate of affairs, a diſſertation upon liberty, ſome ſeaſonable thoughts upon the intended bridge of Black-friars, and an addreſs to Britons. The hiſtory of an old woman, whoſe teeth grew three inches
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0201400800:103"/>
long, an ode upon our victories, a rebus, an acroſtic upon Miſs Peggy P. and a journal of the weather. All this, together with four extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary pages of <hi>letter preſs,</hi> a beautiful map of England, and two prints curiouſly coloured from nature, I fancied might touch their very ſouls. I was actually beginning an addreſs to the people, when my pride at laſt overcame my prudence, and determined me to endeavour to pleaſe by the goodneſs of my entertainment, rather than by the magnificence of my ſign.</p>
               <p>The Spectator, and many ſucceeding eſſayiſts, frequently inform us of the numerous compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments paid them in the courſe of their lucubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; of the frequent encouragements they met to inſpire them with ardour, and increaſe their eagerneſs to pleaſe. I have received <hi>my letters</hi> as well as they; but alas! not congratulatory ones; not aſſuring me of ſucceſs and favour; but pregnant with bodings that might ſhake even fortitude itſelf.</p>
               <p>One gentleman aſſures me, he intends to throw away no more three-pences in purchaſing the BEE, and what is ſtill more diſmal, he will not recommend me as a poor author wanting encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to his neighbourbood, which it ſeems is very numerous. Were my ſoul ſet upon three-pences, what anxiety might not ſuch a denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

produce! But ſuch does not happen to be the preſent motive of publication! I write partly to ſhew my good-nature, and partly to ſhew my vanity; nor will I lay down the pen till I am ſatisfied one way or another.</p>
               <p>Others have diſliked the title and the motto of my paper, point out a miſtake in the one, and aſſure me the other has been conſigned to dulneſs by anticipation. All this may be true; <hi>but what is that to me?</hi> Titles and mottoes to books are like eſcutcheons and dignities in the hands of a king. The wiſe ſometimes condeſcend to <hi>accept</hi> of them; but none but a fool will imagine them of any real importance. We ought to depend upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic merit, and not the ſlender helps of title. <hi>Nam quae non fecimus ipſi, vix ea noſtra voco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my part, I am ever ready to miſtruſt a promiſing title, and have, at ſome expence, been inſtructed not to hearken to the voice of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, let it plead never ſo loudly, or never ſo long. A countryman coming one day to Smithfield, in order to take a ſlice of Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew-fair, found a perfect ſhew before every booth.

               <head>A FLEMISH TRADITION.</head>
               <p>EVERY country has its traditions, which, either too minute or not ſufficiently authentic to receive hiſtorical ſanction, are handed down among the vulgar, and ſerve at once to inſtruct and amuſe them. Of this number the adventures of Robin Hood, the hunting of Chevy chace, and the bravery of Johnny Armſtrong, among the Engliſh; of Kaul Dereg, among the Iriſh; and Creigton, among the Scots, are inſtances. Of all the traditions, however, I remember to have heard, I do not recollect any more remarkable than one ſtill current in Flanders; a ſtory gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the firſt the peaſants tell their children, when they bid them behave like Bidderman the wiſe. It is by no means, however, a model to be ſet before a polite people for imitation; ſince if, on the one hand, we perceive in it the ſteady influence of patriotiſm; we, on the other, find as ſtrong a deſire of revenge. But, to wave introduction, let us to the ſtory.</p>
               <p>When the Saracens over-ran Europe with their armies, and penetrated as far even as Antwerp,</p>
               <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0201400800:107"/>The executioner was, therefore, the firſt object of his reſentment, and he even practiſed the loweſt fraud to gratify the revenge he owed him. A piece of plate, which Biddeman had previouſly ſtolen from the Saracen governor, he privately conveyed into the executioner's houſe, and then gave informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the theft. They who are any way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the rigour of the Arabian laws, know that theft is puniſhed with immediate death. The proof was direct in this caſe; the executioner had nothing to offer in his own defence, and he was therefore condemned to be beheaded upon a ſcaffold in the public market place. As there was no executioner in the city but the very man who was now to ſuffer, Bidderman himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook this, to him, moſt agreeable office. The criminal was conducted from the judgment ſeat, bound with cords. The ſcaffold was erected, and he placed in ſuch a manner, as he might lie moſt convenient for the blow.</p>
               <p>But his death alone was not ſufficient to ſatisfy the reſentment of this extraordinary man, unleſs it was aggravated with every circumſtance of cruelty. Wherefore, coming up the ſcaffold, and diſpoſing every thing in readineſs for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended blow, with the ſword in his hand he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the criminal, and whiſpering in a low voice, aſſured him, that he himſelf was the very perſon that had once been uſed with ſo much
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0201400800:108"/>
cruelty; that to his knowledge, he died very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently, for the plate had been ſtolen by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and privately conveyed into the houſe of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"O, my countrymen, cried the criminal, do you hear what this man ſays?"</q>—<hi>Does the villain murmur?</hi> replied Bidderman, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, at one blow, ſevered his head from his body.</p>
               <p>Still, however, he was not content till he had ample vengeance, of the governors of the city, who condemned him. To effect this, he hired a ſmall houſe adjoining to the town wall, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he every day dug, and carried out the earth in a baſket. In this unremitting labour, he continued ſeveral years, every day digging a little, and carrying the earth unſuſpected away. By this means he at laſt made a ſecret communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from the country into the city, and only wanted the appearance of an enemy, in order to betray it. This opportunity, at length, offered; the French army came into the neighbourhood, but had no thoughts of ſitting down before a town which they conſidered as impregnable. Bidderman, however, ſoon altered their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and, upon communicating his plan to the General, he embraced it with ardour. Through
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0201400800:109"/>
the private paſſage above-mentioned, he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a large body of the moſt reſolute ſoldiers, who ſoon opened the gates for the reſt, and the whole army ruſhing in, put every Saracen that was found to the ſword.</p>

               <head>THE Sagacity of ſome INSECTS. To the AUTHOR of the BEE.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>ANIMALS, in general, are ſagacious in proportion as they cultivate ſociety. The elephant and the beaver ſhew the greateſt ſigns of this when united; but when man intrudes into their communities, they loſe all their ſpirit of induſtry, and teſtify but a very ſmall ſhare of that ſagacity, for which, when in a ſocial ſtate, they are ſo remarkable.</p>
               <p>Among inſects, the labours of the bee and the ant have employed the attention and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the naturaliſt; but their whole ſagacity is loſt upon ſeparation, and a ſingle bee or ant, ſeems deſtitute of every degree of induſtry, is the moſt ſtupid inſect imaginable, languiſhes for a time in ſolitude, and ſoon dies.</p>
               <p>Of all the ſolitary inſects I have ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, the ſpider is the moſt ſagacious, and its actions to me, who have attentively conſidered
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0201400800:111"/>
them, ſeem almoſt to exceed belief. This inſect is formed by nature for a ſtate of war, not only upon other inſects, but upon each other. For this ſtate nature ſeems perfectly well to have formed it. Its head and breaſt are covered with a ſtrong natural coat of mail, which is impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the attempts of every other inſect, and its belly is inveloped in a ſoft pliant ſkin, which eludes the ſting even of a waſp. Its legs are terminated by ſtrong claws, not unlike thoſe of a lobſter, and their vaſt length, like ſpears, ſerve to keep every aſſailant at a diſtance.</p>
               <p>Not worſe furniſhed for obſervation than for an attack or a defence, it has ſeveral eyes, large, tranſparent, and covered with an horny ſubſtance, which, however, does not impede its viſion. Beſides this, it is furniſhed with a forceps above the mouth, which ſerves to kill or ſecure the prey already caught in its claws or its net.</p>
               <p>Such are the implements of war with which the body is immediately furniſh'd; but its net to entangle the enemy ſeems what it chiefly truſts to, and what it takes moſt pains to render as complete as poſſible. Nature has furniſhed the body of this little creature with a glutinous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, which proceeding from the anus, it ſpins into a thread coarſer or finer, as it chuſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or dilate its ſphincter. In order to fix its
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0201400800:112"/>
ſphincter. In order to fix its thread when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to weave, it emits a ſmall drop of its liquid againſt the wall, which hardening by degrees, ſerves to hold the thread very firmly. Then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding from the firſt point, as it recedes the thread lengthens; and when the ſpider has come to the place where the other end of the thread ſhould be fixed, gathering up with its claws the thread which would otherwiſe be too ſlack, it is ſtretched tightly, and fixed in the ſame manner to the wall as before.</p>
               <p>In this manner it ſpins and fixes ſeveral threads parallel to each other, which, ſo to ſpeak, ſerve as the warp to the intended web. To form the woof, it ſpins in the ſame manner its thread, tranſverſly fixing one end to the firſt thread that was ſpun, and which is always the ſtrongeſt of the whole web, and the other to the wall. All theſe threads, being newly ſpun, are glutinous, and therefore ſtick to each other wherever they happen to touch, and in thoſe parts of the web moſt expoſed to be torn, our natural artiſt ſtrengthens them, by doubling the threads ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſix fold.</p>
               <p>Thus far naturaliſts have gone in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this animal; what follows is the reſult of my own obſervation upon that ſpecies of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect called an <hi>Houſe-Spider.</hi> I perceived about
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0201400800:113"/>
four years ago, a large ſpider in one corner of my room, making its web, and though the maid frequently levelled her fatal broom againſt the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the little animal, I had the good fortune then to prevent its deſtruction, and I may ſay, it more than paid me by the entertainment it afforded.</p>
               <p>In three days the web was with incredible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence completed; nor could I avoid thinking that the inſect ſeemed to exult in its new abode. It frequently traverſed it round, examined the ſtrength of every part of it, retired into its hole, and came out very frequently. The firſt enemy, however, it had to encounter, was another and a much larger ſpider, which, having no web of its own, and having probably exhauſted all its ſtock in former labours of this kind, came to invade the property of its neighbour. Soon then a terrible encounter enſued, in which the invader ſeemed to have the victory, and the laborious ſpider was obliged to take refuge in its hole. Upon this I perceived the victor uſing every art to draw the enemy from his ſtrong hold. He ſeemed to go off, but quickly returned, and when he found all arts vain, began to demoliſh the new web without mercy. This brought on another battle, and, contrary to my expectations, the laborious ſpider became conqueror, and fairly killed his antagoniſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0201400800:114"/>Now then, in peaceable poſſeſſion of what was juſtly its own, it waited three days with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt patience, repairing the breaches of its web, and taking no ſuſtenance that I could perceive. At laſt, however, a large blue fly fell into the ſnare, and ſtruggled hard to get looſe. The ſpider gave it leave to entangle itſelf as much as poſſible, but it ſeemed to be too ſtrong for the cobweb. I muſt own I was greatly ſurprized when I ſaw the ſpider immediately ſally out, and in leſs than a minute weave a new net round its captive, by which the motion of its wings was ſtopped, and when it was fairly hampered in this manner, it was ſeized, and dragged into the hole.</p>
               <p>In this manner it lived, in a precarious ſtate, and nature ſeemed to have fitted it for ſuch a life, for upon a ſingle fly it ſubſiſted for more than a week. I once put a waſp into the neſt, but when the ſpider came out in order to ſeize it as uſual, upon perceiving what kind of an enemy it had to deal with, it inſtantly broke all the bands that held it faſt, and contributed all that lay in its power to diſengage ſo formidable an antagoniſt. When the waſp was at liberty, I expected the ſpider would have ſet about repairing the breaches that were made in its net, but thoſe it ſeems were irreparable, wherefore the cobweb was now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0201400800:115"/>
forſaken, and a new one begun, which was completed in the uſual time.</p>
               <p>I had now a mind to try how many cobwebs a ſingle ſpider could furniſh, wherefore I deſtroyed this, and the inſect ſet about another. When I deſtroyed the other alſo, its whole ſtock ſeemed entirely exhauſted, and it could ſpin no more. The arts it made uſe of to ſupport itſelf, now deprived of its great means of ſubſiſtence, were indeed ſurprizing. I have ſeen it roll up its legs like a ball, and lie motionleſs for hours together, but cautiouſly watching all the time; when a fly happened to approach ſufficiently near, it would dart out all at once, and often ſeize its prey.</p>
               <p>Of this life, however, it ſoon began to grow weary, and reſolved to invade the poſſeſſion of ſome other ſpider, ſince it could not make a web of its own. It formed an attack upon a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring fortification with great vigour, and at firſt was as vigorouſly repulſed. Not daunted, however, with one defeat, in this manner it continued to lay ſiege to another's web for three days, and, at length, having killed the defendant, actually took poſſeſſion. When ſmaller flies hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to fall into the ſnare, the ſpider does not ſally out at once, but very patiently waits till it is ſure of them; for, upon his immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, the terror of his appearance might
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0201400800:116"/>
give the captive ſtrength ſufficient to get looſe: The manner then is to wait patiently till, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual and impotent ſtruggles, the captive has waſted all its ſtrength, and then he becomes a certain and an eaſy conqueſt.</p>
               <p>The inſect I am now deſcribing, lived three years; every year it changed its ſkin, and got a new ſet of legs. I have ſometimes plucked off a leg, which grew again in two or three days. At firſt, it dreaded my approach to its web, but at laſt it became ſo familiar as to take a fly out of my hand, and upon my touching any part of the web, would immediately leave its hole, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared either for a defence or an attack.</p>
               <p>To complete this deſcription, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the male ſpider is much leſs than the female, and that the latter are oviparous. When they come to lay, they ſpread a part of their web under the eggs, and then roll them up care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as we roll up things in a cloth, and thus hatch them in their hole. If diſturbed in their holes, they never attempt to eſcape without car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying this young brood in their forceps away with them, and thus frequently are ſacrificed to their paternal affection.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ever the young ones leave their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial covering, they begin to ſpin, and almoſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0201400800:117"/>
ſenſibly ſeem to grow bigger. If they have the good fortune, when even but a day old, to catch a fly, they fall too with good appetites; but they live ſometimes three of four days without any ſort of ſuſtenance, and yet ſtill continue to grow larger, ſo as every day to double their former ſize. As they grow old, however, they do not ſtill continue to encreaſe, but their legs only continue to grow longer; and when a ſpider becomes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſtiff with age, and unable to ſeize its prey, it dies at length of hunger.</p>

upon philoſophy, or an imitator in polite learning, might be regarded as a chimerical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector. Hundreds would be ready not only to point out his errors, but to load him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Our probable opinions are now regarded as certainties; the difficulties hitherto undiſcovered, as utterly inſcrutable; and the writers of the laſt age inimitable, and therefore the propereſt models of imitation.</p>
               <p>One might be almoſt induced to deplore the philoſophic ſpirit of the age, which in proportion as it enlightens the mind, encreaſes its timidity, and repreſſes the vigour of every undertaking. Men are now content with being prudently in the right; which, though not the way to make new acquiſitions, it muſt be owned, is the beſt method of ſecuring what we have. Yet this is certain, that the writer who never deviates, who never hazards a new thought, or a new expreſſion, though his friends may compliment him upon his ſagacity, though criticiſm liſts her feeble voice in his praiſe, will ſeldom arrive at any degree of perfection. The way to acquire laſting eſteem, is not by the fewneſs of a writer's faults, but the greatneſs of his beauties, and our nobleſt works are generally moſt replete with both.</p>
               <p>An author, who would be ſublime, often runs his thought into burleſque; yet I can readily
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0201400800:120"/>
pardon his miſtaking ten times for once ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. True Genius walks along a line, and, perhaps, our greateſt pleaſure is in ſeeing it ſo often near falling, without being ever actually down.</p>
               <p>Every ſcience has its hitherto undiſcovered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, after which men ſhould travel undiſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the failure of former adventurers. Every new attempt ſerves, perhaps, to facilitate its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture invention. We may not find the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's ſtone, but we ſhall probably hit upon new inventions in purſuing it. We ſhall, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, never be able to diſcover the longitude, yet, pehaps, we may arrive at new truths in the inveſtigation.</p>
               <p>Were any of theſe ſagacious minds among us, (and ſurely no nation, or no period, could ever compare with us in this particular) were any of thoſe minds, I ſay, who now ſit down contented with exploring the intricacies of another's ſyſtem, bravely to ſhake off admiration, and undazzled with the ſplendour of another's reputation, to chalk out a path to fame for themſelves, and boldly culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate untried experiment, what might not be the reſult of their enquiries, ſhould the ſame ſtudy that has made them wiſe, make them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing alſo? What could not ſuch qualities, united, produce? But ſuch is not the character
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0201400800:121"/>
of the Engliſh, while our neighbours of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent launch out into the ocean of ſcience, without proper ſtores for the voyage, we fear ſhipwreck in every breeze, and conſume in port thoſe powers which might probably have weather'd every ſtorm.</p>
               <p>Projectors in a ſtate are generally rewarded above their deſerts; projectors in the republic of letters, never. If wrong, every inferior dunce thinks himſelf entituled to laugh at their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; if right, men of ſuperior talents think their honour engaged to oppoſe, ſince every new diſcovery is a tacit diminution of their own pre-eminence.</p>
               <p>To aim at excellence, our reputation, our friends, and our all, muſt be ventured; by aiming only at mediocrity, we run no riſque, and we do little ſervice. Prudence and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are ever perſuading us to contrary purſuits. The one inſtructs us to be content with our ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to find happineſs in bounding every wiſh. The other impels us to ſuperiority, and calls nothing happineſs but rapture. The one directs to follow mankind, and to act and think with the reſt of the world. The other drives us from the crowd, and expoſes us as a mark to all the ſhafts of envy, or ignorance.</p>

               <p>THE clock has ſtruck two, the expiring taper riſes and ſinks in the ſocket, the watchman forgets the hour in ſlumber, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and the happy are at reſt, and nothing now wakes but guilt, revelry and deſpair. The drunkard once more fills the deſtroying bowl, the robber walks his midnight round, and the ſuicide lifts his guilty arm againſt his own ſacred perſon.</p>
               <p>Let me no longer waſte the night over the page of antiquity, or the ſallies of cotemporary genius, but purſue the ſolitary walk, where vanity, ever changing, but a few hours paſt, walked before me, where ſhe kept up the pageant, and now, like a froward child, ſeems huſhed with her own importunities.</p>
               <p>What a gloom hangs all around! the dying lamp feebly emits a yellow gleam, no ſound is heard but of the chiming clock, or the diſtant watch dog. All the buſtle of human pride is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and this hour may well diſplay the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of human vanity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0201400800:124"/>There may come a time when this temporary ſolitude may be made continual, and the city itſelf, like its inhabitants, fade away, and leave a deſart in its room.</p>
               <p>What cities, as great as this, have once tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd in exiſtence, had their victories as great as ours, joy as juſt, and as unbounded as we, and with ſhort-ſighted preſumption, promiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves immortality. Poſterity can hardly trace the ſituation of ſome. The ſorrowful traveller wanders over the awful ruins of others, and as he beholds, he learns wiſdom, and feels the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſience of every ſublunary poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Here ſtood their citadel, but now grown over with weeds; there their ſenate-houſe, but now the haunt of every noxious reptile; temples and theatres ſtood here, now only an undiſtinguiſhed heap of ruin. They are fallen, for luxury and avarice firſt made them feeble. The rewards of ſtate were conferred on amuſing, and not on uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful members of ſociety. Thus true virtue lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, their riches and opulence invited the plunderer, who, though once repulſed, returned again, and at laſt ſwept the defendants into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed deſtruction.</p>
               <p>How few appear in thoſe ſtreets, which but ſome few hours ago were crowded; and thoſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0201400800:125"/>
who appear, no longer now wear their daily maſk, nor attempt to hide their lewdneſs or their miſery.</p>
               <p>But who are thoſe who make the ſtreets their couch, and find a ſhort repoſe from wretchedneſs at the doors of the opulent? Theſe are ſtrangers, wanderers, and orphans, whoſe circumſtances are too humble to expect redreſs, and their diſtreſſes too great even for pity. Some are without the covering even of rags, and others emaciated with diſeaſe; the world ſeems to have diſclaimed them; ſociety turns its back upon their diſtreſs, and has given them up to nakedneſs and hunger. Theſe poor ſhivering females, have once ſeen happier days, and been flattered into beauty. They have been proſtituted to the gay luxurious villain, and are now turned out to meet the ſeverity of winter in the ſtreets. Perhaps now lying at the door of their betrayers they ſue to wretches whoſe hearts are inſenſible to calamity, or debauchees who may curſe, but will not relieve them.</p>
               <p>Why, why was I born a man, and yet ſee the ſufferings of wretches I cannot relieve! Poorhouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs creatures! the world will give you reproaches, but will not give you relief. The ſlighteſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, the moſt imaginary uneaſineſſes of the rich, are aggravated with all the power of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and engage our attention; while you weep unheeded, perſecuted by every ſubordinate
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0201400800:126"/>
ſpecies of tyranny, and finding enmity in every law.</p>
               <p>Why was this heart of mine formed with ſo much ſenſibility! or why was not my fortune adapted to its impulſe! Tenderneſs, without a capacity of relieving, only makes the heart that feels it more wretched than the object which ſues for aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>But let me turn from a ſcene of ſuch diſtreſs to the ſanctified hypocrite, <hi>who has been talking of virtue till the time of bed,</hi> and now ſteals out, to give a looſe to his vices under the protection of midnight; vices more attrocious, becauſe he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to conceal them. See how he pants down the dark alley, and, with haſtening ſteps, fears an acquaintance in every face. He has paſſed the whole day in company he hates, and now goes to prolong the night among company that as heartily hate him. May his vices be detected; may the morning riſe upon his ſhame: yet I wiſh to no purpoſe; villainy, when detected, never gives up, but boldly adds impudence to impoſture.</p>

               <head>Upon POLITICAL FRUGALITY.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>RUGALITY has ever been eſteemed a virtue as well among Pagans as Chriſtians: There have been even heroes who have prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed it. However, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that it is too modeſt a virtue, or, if you will, too obſcure a one to be eſſential to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm, few heroes have been able to attain to ſuch an height. Frugality agrees much better with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks; it ſeems to be the baſe, the ſupport, and, in a word, ſeems to be the inſeparable companion of a juſt adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0201400800:129"/>However this be, there is not, perhaps, in the world a people leſs fond of this virtue than the Engliſh, and of conſequence there is not a nation more reſtleſs, more expoſed to the uneaſineſſes of life, or leſs capable of providing for particular happineſs. We are taught to deſpiſe this virtue from our childhood, our education is improperly directed, and a man who has gone through the politeſt inſtitutions, is generally the perſon who is leaſt acquainted with the wholeſome precepts of frugality. We every day hear the elegance of taſte, the magnificence of ſome, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of others, made the ſubject of our admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and applauſe. All this we ſee repreſented not as the end and recompenſe of labour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, but as the actual reſult of genius, as the mark of a noble and exalted mind.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of theſe praiſes beſtowed on luxury, for which elegance and taſte are but another name, perhaps it may be thought improper to plead the cauſe of frugality. It may be thought low, or vainly declamatory, to exhort our youth from the follies of dreſs, and of every other ſuperfluity to accuſtom themſelves, even with mechanic mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the ſimple neceſſaries of life. Such ſort of inſtructions may appear antiquated; yet, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they ſeem the foundations of all our vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and the moſt efficacious method of making mankind uſeful members of ſociety. Unhappily,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0201400800:130"/>
however, ſuch diſcourſes are not faſhionable among us, and the faſhion ſeems every day growing ſtill more obſolete, ſince the preſs, and every other method of exhortation, ſeems diſpoſed to talk of the luxuries of life as harmleſs enjoyments. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, when a boy, to have remarked, that thoſe who in ſchool wore the fineſt cloaths, were pointed at as being conceited and proud. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, our little maſters are taught to conſider dreſs betimes, and they are regarded, even at ſchool, with contempt, who do not appear as genteel as the reſt. Education ſhould teach us to become uſeful, ſober, diſintereſted and laborious members of ſociety; but does it not at preſent point out a different path! It teaches us to multiply our wants, by which means we become more eager to poſſeſs, in order to diſſipate, a greater charge to ourſelves, and more uſeleſs or obnoxious to ſociety.</p>
               <p>If a youth happens to be poſſeſſed of more genius than fortune, he is early informed that he ought to think of his advancement in the world; that he ſhould labour to make himſelf pleaſing to his ſuperiors; that he ſhould ſhun low company; (by which is meant the company of his equals) that he ſhould rather live a little above than below his fortune; that he ſhould think of becoming great; but he finds none to admoniſh him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come frugal, to perſevere in one ſingle deſign, to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0201400800:131"/>
avoid every pleaſure and all flattery, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſeeming to conciliate the favour of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, never conciliate their eſteem. There are none to teach him that the beſt way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming happy in himſelf, and uſeful to others, is to continue in the ſtate which fortune at firſt placed him, without making too haſty ſtrides to advancement; that greatneſs may be attained, but ſhould not be expected; and that they who moſt impatiently expect advancement, are ſeldom poſſeſſed of their wiſhes. He has few, I ſay, to teach him this leſſon, or to moderate his youthful paſſions, yet, this experience may ſay, that a young man, who but for ſix years of the early part of his life, could ſeem diveſted of all his paſſions, would certainly make, or conſiderably increaſe his fortune, and might indulge ſeveral of his favourite inclinations in manhood with the utmoſt ſecurity.</p>
               <p>The efficaciouſneſs of theſe means are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known and acknowledged; but as we are apt to connect a low idea with all our notions of frugality, the perſon who would perſuade us to it, might be accuſed of preaching up avarice.</p>
               <p>Of all vices, however, againſt which morality diſſuades, there is not one more undetermined than this of avarice. Miſers are deſcribed by ſome, as men diveſted of honour, ſentiment or huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0201400800:132"/>
but this is only an ideal picture, or the reſemblance at leaſt is found but in a few. In truth, they who are generally called miſers, are ſome of the very beſt members of ſociety. The ſober, the laborious, the attentive, the frugal, are thus ſtiled by the gay, giddy, thoughtleſs and extravagant. The firſt ſet of men do ſociety all the good, and the latter all the evil that is felt. Even the exceſſes of the firſt no way injure the commonwealth; thoſe of the latter are the moſt injurious that can be conceived.</p>
               <p>The ancient Romans, more rational than we in this particular, were very far from thus miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing their admiration or praiſe; inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the practice of parſimony as low or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, they made it ſynonimous even with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity. They eſteemed thoſe virtues ſo inſeparable, that the known expreſſion of <hi>Vir Frugi</hi> ſignified, at one and the ſame time, a ſober and managing man, an honeſt man, and a man of ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>The ſcriptures, in a thouſand places, praiſe oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy; and it is every where diſtinguiſhed from avarice. But in ſpite of all its ſacred dictates, a taſte for vain pleaſures and fooliſh expence is the ruling paſſion of the preſent times. Paſſion did I call it, rather the madneſs which at once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the great and the little, the rich and the poor; even ſome are ſo intent upon acquiring the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0201400800:133"/>
ſuperfluities of life, that they ſacrifice its neceſſaries in this fooliſh purſuit.</p>
               <p>To attempt the entire abolition of luxury, as it would be impoſſible, ſo it is not my intent. The generality of mankind are too weak, too much ſlaves, to cuſtom and opinion, to reſiſt the torrent of bad example. But if it be impoſſible to convert the multitude; thoſe who have received a more extended education, who are enlightened and judicious, may find ſome hints on this ſubject uſeful. They may ſee ſome abuſes, the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which would by no means endanger public liberty; they may be directed to the abolition of ſome unneceſſary expences, which have no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote happineſs or virtue, and which might be directed to better purpoſes. Our fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, our public feaſts and entertainments, our entries of ambaſſadors, &amp;c. what mummery all this; what childiſh pageants, what millions are ſacrificed in paying tribute to cuſtom, what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary charge at times when we are preſſed with real want, which cannot be ſatisfied without burthening the poor?</p>
               <p>Were ſuch ſuppreſſed entirely, not a ſingle crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the ſtate would have the leaſt cauſe to mourn their ſuppreſſion, and many might be eaſed of a load they now feel lying heavily upon them. If this were put in practice, it would agree with the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0201400800:134"/>
advice of a ſenſible writer of Sweden, who, in the Gazette de France, 1753, thus expreſſed himſelf on that ſubject. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"It were ſincerely to be wiſhed, ſays he, that the cuſtom were eſtabliſhed amongſt us, that in all events which cauſe a publick joy, we made our exultations conſpicuous only by acts uſeful to ſociety. We ſhould then quickly ſee many uſeful monuments of our reaſon, which would much better perpetuate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of things worthy of being tranſmitted to poſterity, and would be much more glorious to humanity than all theſe tumultuous prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of feaſts, entertainments, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicings uſed upon ſuch occaſions."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame propoſal was long before confirmed by a Chineſe emperor, who lived in the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, who, upon an occaſion of extraordinary joy, forbad his ſubjects to make the uſual illluminations, either with a deſign of ſparing their ſubſtance, or of turning them to ſome more durable indication of joy, more glorious for him, and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to his people.</p>
               <p>After ſuch inſtances of political frugality, can we then continue to blame the Dutch ambaſſador at a certain court, who receiving, at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the portrait of the king, enriched with diamonds, aſked what this fine thing might be worth? Being told that it might amount to about
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0201400800:135"/>
two thouſand pounds. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And why, cries he, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not his majeſty keep the picture, and give me the money?"</q> This ſimplicity may be ridiculed at firſt; but, when we come to examine it more cloſely, men of ſenſe will at once confeſs that he had reaſon in what he ſaid, and that a purſe of two thouſand guineas is much more ſerviceable than a picture.</p>
               <p>Should we follow the ſame method of ſtate fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality in other reſpects, what numberleſs ſavings might not be the reſult! How many poſſibilities of ſaving in the adminiſtration of juſtice, which now burdens the ſubject, and enriches ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſociety, who are uſeful only from its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption!</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſhed, that they who govern kingdoms, would imitate artizans. When at London a new ſtuff has been invented, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately counterfeited in France. How happy were it for ſociety, if a firſt miniſter would be equally ſolicitous to tranſplant the uſeful laws of other countries into his own. We are arrived at a perfect imitation of Porcelaine; let us endeavour to imitate the good to ſociety that our neighbours are found to practiſe, and let our neighbours alſo imitate thoſe parts of duty in which we excel.</p>
               <p>There are ſome men, who, in their garden, attempt to raiſe thoſe fruits which nature has
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0201400800:136"/>
adapted only to the ſultry climates beneath the line. We have at our very doors a thouſand laws and cuſtoms infinitely uſeful; theſe are the fruits we ſhould endeavour to tranſplant; theſe the exotics that would ſpeedily become naturalized to the ſoil. They might grow in every climate, and benefit every poſſeſſor.</p>
               <p>The beſt and the moſt uſeful laws I have ever ſeen, are generally practiſed in Holland. When two men are determined to go to law with each other, they are firſt obliged to go before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling judges, called the <hi>peace makers.</hi> If the parties come attended with an advocate or a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor, they are obliged to retire, as we take fuel from the fire we are deſirous of extinguiſhing.</p>
               <p>The peace makers then begin adviſing the parties, by aſſuring them, that it is the height of folly to waſte their ſubſtance, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves mutually miſerable, by having recourſe to the tribunals of juſtice: Follow but our direction, and we will accommodate matters without any expence to either. If the rage of debate is too ſtrong upon either party, they are remitted back for another day, in order that time may ſoften their tempers, and produce a reconciliation. They are thus ſent for twice or thrice; if their folly happens to be incurable, they are permitted to go to law, and as we give up to amputation, ſuch
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0201400800:137"/>
members as cannot be cured by art, juſtice is permitted to take its courſe.</p>
               <p>It is unneceſſary to make here long declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or calculate what ſociety would ſave, were this law adopted. I am ſenſible, that the man who adviſes any reformation, only ſerves to make himſelf ridiculous. What! mankind will be apt to ſay, adopt the cuſtoms of countries that have not ſo much real liberty as our own, our preſent cuſtoms what are they to any man; we are very happy under them! This muſt be a very pleaſant fellow, who attempts to make us happier than we already are! Does he not know that abuſes are the patrimony of a great part of the nation. Why deprive us of a malady by which ſuch numbers find their account. This I muſt own is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to which I have nothing to reply.</p>
               <p>What numberleſs ſavings might there not be made in both arts and commerce, particularly in the liberty of exerciſing trade, without the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary prerequiſites of freedom! Such uſeleſs obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have crept into every ſtate, from a ſpirit of monopoly, a narrow ſelfiſh ſpirit of gain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt attention to general ſociety. Such a clog upon induſtry frequently drives the poor from labour, and reduces them, by degrees, to a ſtate of hopeleſs indigence. We have already a more than ſufficient repugnance to labour; we ſhould
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0201400800:138"/>
by no means encreaſe the obſtacles, or make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes in a ſtate for idleneſs. Such faults have ever crept into a ſtate, under wrong or needy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations.</p>
               <p>Excluſive of the maſters, there are numberleſs faulty expences among the workmen; clubs, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, freedoms, and ſuch like impoſitions, which are not too minute even for law to take notice of, and which ſhould be aboliſhed without mercy, ſince they are ever the inlets to exceſs and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are the parent of all thoſe outrages which naturally fall upon the more uſeful part of ſociety. In the towns and countries I have ſeen, I never ſaw a city or a village yet, whoſe miſeries were not in proportion to the number of its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic houſes. In Rotterdam, you may go through eight or ten ſtreets without finding a public houſe. In Antwerp, almoſt every ſecond houſe ſeems an alehouſe. In the one city, all wears the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of happineſs and warm affluence; in the other, the young fellows walk about the ſtreets in ſhabby finery, their fathers ſit at the door derning or knitting ſtockings, while their ports are filled with dunghills.</p>
               <p>Alehouſes are ever an occaſion of debauchery and exceſs, and either in a religious or political light, it would be our higheſt intereſt to have the greateſt part of them ſuppreſſed. They ſhould be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0201400800:139"/>
laws of not continuing open beyond a certain hour, and harbouring only proper perſons. Theſe rules, it may be ſaid, will diminiſh the neceſſary taxes; but this is falſe reaſoning, ſince what was conſumed in debauchery abroad, would, if ſuch a regulation took place, be more juſtly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, more equitably for the workman's family, ſpent at home; and this cheaper to them, and without loſs of time. On the other hand, our alehouſes being ever open, interrupt buſineſs; the workman is rever certain who frequents them, nor can the maſter be ſure of having what was begun, finiſhed at the convenient time.</p>
               <p>An habit of frugality among the lower orders of mankind is much more beneficial to ſociety than the unreflecting might imagine. The pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broker, the attorney, and other peſts of ſociety, might, by proper management, be turned into ſerviceable members; and, were their trades aboliſhed, it is poſſible the ſame avarice that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts the one, or the ſame chicanery that charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terizes the other, might, by proper regulations, be converted into frugality, and commendable prudence.</p>
               <p>But ſome have made the eulogium of luxury, have repreſented it as the natural conſequence of every country that is become rich. Did we not employ our extraordinary wealth in ſuperfluities,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0201400800:140"/>
ſay they, what other means would there be to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it in? To which it may be anſwered, If frugality were eſtabliſhed in the ſtate, if our expences were laid out rather in the neceſſaries than the ſuperfluities of life, there might be fewer wants, and even fewer pleaſures, but infinitely more happineſs. The rich and the great would be better able to ſatisfy their creditors; they would be better able to marry their children, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of one marriage at preſent, there might be two, if ſuch regulations took place.</p>
               <p>The imaginary calls of vanity, which in reality contribute nothing to our real felicity, would not then be attended to, while the real calls of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might he always and univerſally ſupplied. The difference of employment in the ſubject is what, in reality, produces the good of ſociety. If the ſubject be engaged in providing only the luxuries, the neceſſaries muſt be deficient in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. If neglecting the produce of our own country, our minds are ſet upon the productions of another, we encreaſe our wants, but not our means; and every new imported delicacy for our tables, or ornament in our equipage, is a tax upon the poor.</p>
               <p>The true intereſt of every government is to cultivate the neceſſaries, by which is always meant every happineſs our own country can produce; and ſuppreſs all the luxuries, by which is meant,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0201400800:141"/>
on the other hand, every happineſs imported from abroad. Commerce has therefore its bounds; and every new import, inſtead of encouragement, ſhould be firſt examined whether it be conducive to the intereſt of ſociety.</p>
               <p>Among the many publications with which the preſs is every day burthened, I have often won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered why we never had, as in other countries, an Oeconomical Journal, which might at once direct to all the uſeful diſcoveries in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and ſpread thoſe of our own. As other journals ſerve to amuſe the learned, or what is more often the caſe, to make them quarrel, while they only ſerve to give us the hiſtory of the miſchievous world, for ſo I call our warriors; or the idle world, for ſo may the learned be called; they never trouble their heads about the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful part of mankind, our peaſants and our arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans; were ſuch a work carried into execution with proper management and juſt direction, it might ſerve as a repoſitory for every uſeful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and increaſe that knowledge which learning often ſerves to confound.</p>
               <p>Sweden ſeems the only country where the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of oeconomy ſeems to have fixed its empire. In other countries, it is cultivated only by a few admirers, or by ſocieties which have not received
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0201400800:142"/>
ſufficient ſanction to become compleatly uſeful; but here there is founded a royal academy, deſtined to this purpoſe only, compoſed of the moſt learned and powerful members of the ſtate; an academy which declines every thing which only terminates in amuſement, erudition or curioſity, and admits only of obſervations tending to illuſtrate huſbandry, agriculture, and every real phyſical improvement. In this country nothing is left to private rapacity, but every improvement is immediately diffuſed, and its inventor immediately recompenſed by the ſtate. Happy were it ſo in other countries; by this means every impoſtor would be prevented from ruining or deceiving the publick with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended diſcoveries or noſtrums, and every real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor would not, by this means, ſuffer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, true oeconomy, equally unknown to the prodigal and avaricious, ſeems to be a juſt mean between both extremes; and to a tranſgreſſion of this, at preſent decried virtue, it is that we are to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute a great part of the evils which infeſt ſociety. A taſte for ſuperfluity, amuſement, and pleaſure bring effeminacy, idleneſs, and expence in their train. But a thirſt of riches is always proportioned to our debauchery, and the greateſt prodigal is too frequently found to be the greateſt miſer; ſo that the vices which ſeem the moſt oppoſite, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0201400800:143"/>
found to produce each other; and, to avoid both, it is only neceſſary to be frugal.</p>

               <head>A RESVERIE.</head>
               <p>SCARCE a day paſſes in which we do not hear compliments paid to Dryden, Pope, and other writers of the laſt age, while not a month comes forward that is not loaded with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective againſt the writers of this. Strange, that our critics ſhould be fond of giving their favours to thoſe who are inſenſible of the obligation, and their diſlike to theſe who, of all mankind, are moſt apt to retaliate the injury.</p>
               <p>Even though our preſent writers had not equal merit with their predeceſſors, it would be politic to uſe them with ceremony. Every compliment paid them would be more agreeable, in proportion as they leaſt deſerved it. Tell a lady with an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome face that ſhe is pretty, ſhe only thinks it her due; it is what the has heard a thouſand times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from others, and diſregards the compliment: but aſſure a lady, the cut of whoſe viſage is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more plain, that ſhe looks killing to-day, ſhe inſtantly bridles up and feels the force of the well-timed flattery the whole day after. Compliments which we think are deſerved, we only accept, as debts, with indifference; but thoſe which conſcience
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0201400800:145"/>
informs us we do not merit, we receive with the ſame gratitude that we do favours given away.</p>
               <p>Our gentlemen, however, who preſide at the diſtribution of literary fame, ſeem reſolved to part with praiſe neither from motives of juſtice, or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity; one would think, when they take pen in hand, that it was only to blot reputations, and to put their ſeals to the pacquet which conſigns every new-born effort to oblivion.</p>
               <p>Yet, notwithſtanding the republic of letters hangs at preſent to feebly together; though thoſe friendſhips which once promoted literary fame ſeem now to be diſcontinued; though every writer who now draws the quill ſeems to aim at profit, as well as applauſe, many among them are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably laying in ſtores for immortality, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a ſufficient ſtock of reputation to laſt the whole journey.</p>
               <p>As I was indulging theſe reflections, in order to eke out the preſent page, I could not avoid pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the metaphor, of going a journey, in my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and formed the following Reſverie too wild for allegory, and too regular for a dream.</p>
               <p>I fancied myſelf placed in the yard of a large inn, in which there were an infinite number of waggons and ſtage coaches, attended by fellows
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0201400800:146"/>
who either invited the company to take their places, or were buſied in packing their baggage. Each vehicle had its inſcription, ſhewing the place of its deſtination. On one I could read, <hi>The pleaſure ſtage-coach</hi>; on another, <hi>The waggon of induſtry</hi>; on a third, <hi>The vanity whim</hi>; and on a fourth, <hi>The landau of riches.</hi> I had ſome inclination to ſtep into each of theſe, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but I know not by what means I paſſed them by, and at laſt fixed my eye upon a ſmall carriage, Berlin faſhion, which ſeemed the moſt convenient vehicle at a diſtance in the world; and, upon my nearer approach, found it to be <hi>The fame machine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I inſtantly made up to the coachman, whom I found to be an affable and ſeemingly good-natured fellow. He informed me, that he had but a few days ago returned from the temple of fame, to which he had been carrying Addiſon, Swift, Pope, Steele, Congreve, and Colley Cibber. That they made but indifferent company by the way, and that he once or twice was going to empty his berlin of the whole cargo: however, ſays he, I got them all ſafe home, with no other damage than a black eye, which Colley gave Mr. Pope, and am now returned for another coachful. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If that be all, friend, ſaid I, and if you are in want of company, I'll make one with all my heart. Open the door; I hope the machine rides eaſy."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Oh! for that, ſir, extremely
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0201400800:147"/>
eaſy."</q> But ſtill keeping the door ſhut, and meaſuring me with his eye, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Pray, ſir, have you no luggage? You ſeem to be a good-natured ſort of a gentleman; but I don't find you have got any luggage, and I never permit any to travel with me but ſuch as have ſomething valuable to pay for coach-hire."</q> Examining my pockets, I own I was not a little diſconcerted at this unexpected rebuff; but conſidering that I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a number of the BEE under my arm, I was reſolved to open it in his eyes, and dazzle him with the ſplendor of the page. He read the title and contents, however, without any emotion, and aſſured me he had never heard of it before. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In ſhort, friend, ſaid he, now loſing all his former reſpect, you muſt not come in. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect better paſſengers; but, as you ſeem an harmleſs creature, perhaps, if there be room left, I may let you ride a while for charity."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I now took my ſtand by the coachman at the door, and ſince I could not command a ſeat, was reſolved to be as uſeful as poſſible, and earn by my aſſiduity, what I could not by my merit.</p>
               <p>The next that preſented for a place, was a moſt whimſical figure indeed. He was hung round with papers of his own compoſing, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like thoſe who ſing ballads in the ſtreets, and came dancing up to the door with all the confidence of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0201400800:148"/>
inſtant admittance. The volubility of his motion and addreſs prevented my being able to read more of his cargo than the word Inſpector, which was written in great letters at the top of ſome of the papers. He opened the coach-door himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ceremony, and was juſt ſlipping in, when the coachman, with as little ceremony, pulled him back. Our figure ſeemed perfectly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at this repulſe, and demanded gentleman's ſatisfaction. <q rend="inline">"Lord, ſir! replied the coachman, inſtead of proper luggage, by your bulk you ſeem loaded for a Weſt-India voyage. You are big enough, with all your papers, to crack twenty ſtage-coaches. Excuſe me, indeed, ſir, for you muſt not enter."</q> Our figure now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to expoſtulate; he aſſured the coachman, that though his baggage ſeemed to bulky, it was perfectly light, and that he would be contented with the ſmalleſt corner of room. But Jehu was inflexible, and the carrier of the inſpectors was ſent to dance back again, with all his papers flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in the wind. We expected to have no more trouble from this quarter, when, in a few minutes, the ſame figure changed his appearance, like harlequin upon the ſtage, and with the ſame confidence again made his approaches, dreſſed in lace, and carrying nothing but a noſegay. Upon coming near, he thruſt the noſegay to the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's note, graſped the braſs, and ſeemed now reſolved to enter by violence. I found the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0201400800:149"/>
ſtruggle ſoon begin to grow hot, and the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was a little old, unable to continue the conteſt, ſo, in order to ingratiate myſelf, I ſtept in to his aſſiſtance, and our united efforts ſent our literary Proteus, though worſted, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered ſtill, clear off, dancing a rigadoon, and ſmelling to his own noſegay.</p>
               <p>The perſon who after him appeared as candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date for a place in the ſtage, came up with an air not quire ſo confident, but ſomewhat how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theatrical; and, inſtead of entering, made the coachman a very low bow, which the other returned, and deſired to ſee his baggage; upon which he inſtantly produced ſome farces, a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, and other miſcellany productions. The coachman, caſting his eye upon the cargoe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him, at preſent he could not poſſibly have a place, but hoped in time he might aſpire to one, as he ſeemed to have read in the book of nature, without a careful peruſal of which none ever found entrance at the temple of fame. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What, (replied the diſappointed poet) ſhall my tragedy, in which I have vindicated the cauſe of liberty and virtue!"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Follow nature, (returned the other) and never expect to find laſting fame by topics which only pleaſe from their popularity. Had you been firſt in the cauſe of freedom, or praiſed in virtue more than an empty name, it is poſſible you might have
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0201400800:150"/>
gained admittance; but at preſent I beg, ſir, you will ſtand aſide for another gentleman whom I ſee approaching."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was a very grave perſonage, whom at ſome diſtance I took for one of the moſt reſerved, and even diſagreeable figures I had ſeen; but as he approached, his appearance improved, and when I could diſtinguiſh him thoroughly, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that, in ſpite of the ſeverity of his brow, he had one of the moſt good-natured countenances that could be imagined. Upon coming to open the ſtage door, he lifted a parcel of folios into the ſeat before him, but our inquiſitorial coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at once ſhoved them out again. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What, not take in my dictionary! exclaimed the other in a rage."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Be patient, ſir, (replyed the coachman) I have drove a coach, man and boy, theſe two thouſand years; but I do not remember to have carried above one dictionary during the whole time. That little book which I perceive peeping from one of your pockets, may I preſume to aſk what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"A mere trifle, (replied the author) it is called the Rambler."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The Rambler! (ſays the coachman) I beg, ſir, you'll take your place; I have heard our ladies in the court of Apollo frequently mention it with rapture; and Clio, who happens to be a little grave, has been heard to prefer it to the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0201400800:151"/>
Spectator; though others have obſerved, that the reflections, by being refined, ſometimes become minute."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This grave gentleman was ſcarce ſeated, when another, whoſe appearance was ſomething more modern, ſeemed willing to enter, yet afraid to aſk. He carried in his hand a bundle of eſſays, of which the coachman was curious enough to enquire the contents. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Theſe (replied the gentleman) are rhapſodies againſt the religion of my country."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And how can you expect to come into my coach, after thus chuſing the wrong ſide of the queſtion."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Ay, but I am right (replied the other;) and if you give me leave, I ſhall in a few minutes ſtate the argument."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Right or wrong (ſaid the coachman) he who diſturbs religion, is a blockhead, and he ſhall never travel in a coach of mine."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If then (ſaid the gentleman, muſtering up all his courage) if I am not to have admittance as an eſſayiſt, I hope I ſhall not be repulſed as an hiſtorian; the laſt volume of my hiſtory met with applauſe."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Yes, (replied the coachman) but I have heard only the firſt approved at the temple of fame; and as I ſee you have it about you, enter without further ceremony."</q> My attention was now diverted to a crowd, who were puſhing forward a perſon that ſeemed more inclined to the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0201400800:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>ſtage coach of riches</hi>; but by their means he was driven forward to the ſame machine, which he, however, ſeemed heartily to deſpiſe. Impelled, however, by their ſollicitations, he ſteps up, flouriſhing a voluminous hiſtory, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admittance. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Sir, I have formerly heard your name mentioned (ſays the coachman) but never as an hiſtorian. Is there no other work upon which you may claim a place?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"None, replied the other, except a romance; but this is a work of too trifling a nature to claim future attention."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"You miſtake (ſays the inquiſitor) a well-written romance is no ſuch eaſy taſk as is generally imagined. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber formerly to have carried Cervantes and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grais, and if you think fit, you may enter."</q> Upon our three literary travellers coming into the ſame coach, I liſtened attentively to hear what might be the converſation that paſſed upon this extraordinary occaſion; when, inſtead of agreeable or entertaining dialogue, I found them grumbling at each other, and each ſeemed diſcontented with his companions. Strange! thought I to myſelf, that they who are thus born to enlighten the world, ſhould ſtill preſerve the narrow preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of childhood, and, by diſagreeing, make even the higheſt merit ridiculous. Were the learned and the wiſe to unite againſt the dunces of ſociety, inſtead of ſometimes ſiding into oppoſite parties with them, they might throw a luſtre
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0201400800:153"/>

               <p>In the midſt of theſe reflections, I perceived the coachman, unmindful of me, had now mounted the box. Several were approaching to be taken in, whoſe pretenſions I was ſenſible were very juſt, I therefore deſired him to ſtop, and take in more paſſengers; but he replied, as he had now mounted the box, it would be improper to come down; but that he ſhould take them all, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other, when he ſhould return. So he drove away, and, for myſelf, as I could not get in, I mounted behind, in order to hear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation on the way.</p>

               <head>A Word or two on the late FARCE, CALLED HIGH LIFE BELOW STAIRS.</head>
               <p>JUST as I had expected, before I ſaw this farce, I found it, formed on too narrow a plan to afford a pleaſing variety. The ſameneſs of the humour in every ſcene could not at laſt fail of being diſagreeable. The poor, affecting the manners of the rich, might be carried on thro'
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0201400800:154"/>
one character or two at the moſt, with great propriety; but to have almoſt every perſonage on the ſcene almoſt of the ſame character, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting the follies of each other, was unartful in the poet to the laſt degree.</p>
               <p>The ſcene was alſo almoſt a continuation of the ſame abſurdity; and my Lord Duke and Sir Harry (two footmen who aſſume theſe characters) have nothing elſe to <hi>do</hi> but to talk like their maſters, and are only introduced to ſpeak, and to ſhew themſelves. Thus, as there is a ſame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of character, there is a barrenneſs of inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which, by a very ſmall ſhare of addreſs, the poet might have eaſily avoided.</p>
               <p>From a conformity to critic rules, which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, on the whole, have done more harm than good, our author has ſacrificed all the vivacity of the dialogue to nature; and though he makes his characters talk like ſervants, they are ſeldom abſurd enough, or lively enough, to make us merry. Though he is always natural, he happens ſeldom to be humorous.</p>
               <p>The ſatire was well intended, if we regard it as being maſters ourſelves; but, probably, a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher would rejoice in that liberty which Engliſhmen give their domeſtics; and, for my own part, I cannot avoid being pleaſed at the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0201400800:155"/>
happineſs of thoſe poor creatures, who, in ſome meaſure, contribute to mine. The Athenians, the politeſt and beſt-natured people upon earth, were the kindeſt to their ſlaves; and if a perſon may judge, who has ſeen the world, our Engliſh ſervants are the beſt treated, becauſe the generality of our Engliſh gentlemen, are the politeſt under the ſun.</p>
               <p>But not to lift my feeble voice among the pack of critics, who, probably, have no other occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but that of cutting up every thing new. I muſt own, there are one or two ſcenes that are fine ſatire, and ſufficiently humorous; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the firſt interview between the two footmen, which, at once, ridicules the manners of the great, and the abſurdity of their imitators.</p>
               <p>Whatever defects there might be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, there were none in the action; in this the performers ſhewed more humour than I had fancied them capable of. Mr. Palmer and Mr. King were entirely what they deſired to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and Mrs. Give (but what need I talk of her, ſince, without the leaſt exaggeration, ſhe has more true humour than any actor or actreſs upon the Engliſh or any other ſtage I have ſeen;) ſhe, I ſay, did the part all the juſtice it was capable of. And, upon the whole, a farce, which has only this to recommend it, that the author took his plan from the volume of nature, by the ſprightly manner in which it was performed, was, for one night, a tolerable entertainment. Thus much
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0201400800:156"/>
may be ſaid in its vindication, that people of faſhion ſeemed more pleaſed in the repreſentation than the ſubordinate ranks of people.</p>

               <p>EVERY age ſeems to have its favourite pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, which ſerve to amuſe the idle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the attention of the induſtrious. Happy the man who is born excellent in the purſuit in vogue, and whoſe genius ſeems adapted to the times he lives in. How many do we ſee, who might have excelled in arts or ſciences, and who ſeem fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with talents equal to the greateſt diſcoveries, had the road not been already beaten by their predeceſſors, and nothing left for them, except trifles to diſcover, while others, of very moderate abilities, become famous, becauſe happening to be firſt in the reigning purſuit.</p>
               <p>Thus, at the renewal of letters in Europe, the taſte was not to compoſe new books, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the old ones. It was not to be expected that new books ſhould be written, when there were ſo many of the Ancients, either not known, or not underſtood. It was not reaſonable to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt new conqueſts, while they had ſuch an extenſive region lying waſte for want of cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At that period, criticiſm and erudition were the reigning ſtudies of the times; and he, who had only an inventive genius, might have
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0201400800:157"/>
languiſhed in hopeleſs obſcurity. When the writers of antiquity were ſufficiently explained and known, the learned ſet about imitating them: From hence proceeded the number of latin ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, poets and hiſtorians, in the reigns of Clement the ſeventh, and Alexander the ſixth. This paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for antiquity laſted for many years, to the utter excluſion of every other purſuit, till ſome began to find, that thoſe works which were imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated from nature, were more like the writings of antiquity, than even thoſe written in expreſs imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. It was then modern language began to be cultivated with aſſiduity, and our poets and orators poured forth their wonders upon the world.</p>
               <p>As writers become more numerous, it is natural for readers to become more indolent; from whence muſt neceſſarily ariſe a deſire of attaining know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with the greateſt poſſible eaſe. No ſcience or art offers its inſtruction and amuſement in ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious a manner as ſtatuary and painting. From hence we ſee, that a deſire of cultivating thoſe arts generally attends the decline of ſcience. Thus the fineſt ſtatues, and the moſt beautiful paintings of antiquity preceded but a little the abſolute decay of every other ſcience. The ſtatues of Antoninus, Comodus, and their cotemporaries, are the fineſt productions of the chiſſel, and appeared but juſt before learning was deſtroyed by comment, criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, and barbarous invaſions.</p>
               <p>What happened in Rome may probably be the caſe with us at home. Our nobility are now more
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0201400800:158"/>
ſolicitous in patronizing painters and ſculptors than thoſe of any other polite profeſſion; and from the lord, who has his gallery, down to the 'prentice, who has his twopenny copper-plate, all are admirers of this art. The great, by their careſſes, ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to all other merit but that of the pencil; and the vulgar buy every book rather from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of the ſculptor than the writer.</p>
               <p>How happy were it now, if men of real excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in that profeſſion were to ariſe! Were the painters of Italy now to appear, who once wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered like beggars from one city to another, and produce their almoſt breathing figures, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards might they not expect! But many of them lived without rewards, and therefore rewards alone will never produce their equals. We have often found the great exert themſelves not only without promotion, but in ſpite of oppoſition. We have found them flouriſhing, like medicinal plants, in a region of ſavageneſs and barbarity, their excellence unknown, and their virtues unheeded.</p>
               <p>They who have ſeen the paintings of Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagio are ſenſible of the ſurpriſing impreſſion they make; bold, ſwelling, terrible to the laſt degree; all ſeem animated, and ſpeaks him among the foremoſt of his profeſſion; yet this man's fortune and his fame ſeemed ever in oppoſition to each other.</p>
               <p>Unknowing how to flatter the great, he was driven from city to city in the utmoſt indigence, and might truly be ſaid to paint for his bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0201400800:159"/>Having one day inſulted a perſon of diſtinction, who refuſed to pay him all the reſpect which he thought his due, he was obliged to leave Rome, and travel on foot, his uſual method of going his journeys down into the country, without either money or friends to ſubſiſt him.</p>
               <p>After he had travelled in this manner as long as his ſtrength would permit, faint with famine and fatigue, he at laſt called at an obſcure inn by the way ſide.

               <p>As Caravagio was entirely deſtitute of money, he took down the inkeeper's ſign, and painted it anew for his dinner.</p>
               <p>Thus refreſhed, he proceeded on his journey, and left the innkeeper not quite ſatisfied with this method of payment. Some company of diſtinction, however, coming ſoon after, and ſtruck with the beauty of the new ſign, bought it at an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced price, and aſtoniſhed the innkeeper with their generoſity; he was reſolved, therefore, to get as many ſigns as poſſible drawn by the ſame artiſt, as he found he could ſell them to good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and accordingly ſet out after Caravadgio, in order to bring him back.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S few ſubjects are more intereſting to ſociety, ſo few have been more frequently written upon, than the education of youth. Yet is it not a little ſurprizing, that it ſhould have been treated almoſt by all in a declamatory manner? They have inſiſted largely on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that reſult from it, both to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual and to ſociety, and have expatiated in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0201400800:161"/>
the praiſe of what none have ever been ſo hardy as to call in queſtion.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of giving us fine, but empty harangues, upon this ſubject, inſtead of indulging each his particular and whimſical ſyſtems, it had been much better if the writers on this ſubject had treated it in a more ſcientific manner, repreſſed all the ſallies of imagination, and given us the reſult of their obſervations with didactic ſimplicity. Upon this ſubject, the ſmalleſt errors are of the moſt dangerous conſequence; and the author ſhould venture the imputation of ſtupidity upon a topic, where his ſlighteſt deviations may tend to injure the riſing generation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall, therefore, throw out a few thoughts upon this ſubject, which have not been attended to by others, and ſhall diſmiſs all attempts to pleaſe, while I ſtudy only inſtruction.</p>
               <p>The manner in which our youth of London are at preſent educated is, ſome in free ſchools in the city, but the far greater number in boarding ſchools about town. The parent juſtly conſults the health of his child, and finds an education in the country tends to promote this, much more than a continuance in town. Thus far they are right; if there were a poſſibility of having even our free ſchools kept a little out of town, it
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0201400800:162"/>
would certainly conduce to the health and vigour of, perhaps, the mind, as well as the body. It may be thought whimſical, but it is truth; I have found by experience, that they, who have ſpent all their lives in cities, contract not only an effeminacy of habit, but even of thinking.</p>
               <p>But when I have ſaid, that the boarding ſchools are preferable to free ſchools, as being in the country, this is certainly the only advantage I can allow them, otherwiſe it is impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ignorance of thoſe who take upon them the important truſt of education. Is any man unfit for any of the profeſſions; he finds his laſt reſource in ſetting up ſchool. Do any become bankrupts in trade. They ſtill ſet up a boarding ſchool, and drive a trade this way, when all others fail: Nay, I have been told of butchers and barbers, who have turned ſchoolmaſters; and more ſurpriſing ſtill, made fortunes in their new profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Could we think ourſelves in a country of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized people; could it be conceived that we have any regard for poſterity, when ſuch are permitted to take the charge of the morals, genius and health of thoſe dear little pledges, who may one day be the guardians of the liberties of Europe, and who may ſerve as the honour and bulwark of their aged parents? The care of our children, is it
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0201400800:163"/>
below the ſtate? is it fit to indulge the caprice of the ignorant with the diſpoſal of their children in this particular? For the ſtate to take the charge of all its children, as in Perſia or Sparta, might at preſent be inconvenient; but ſurely, with great eaſe, it might caſt an eye to their inſtructors. Of all members of ſociety, I do not know a more uſeful, or a more honourable one, than a ſchool-maſter; at the ſame time that I do not ſee any more generally deſpiſed, or whoſe talents are ſo ill rewarded.</p>
               <p>Were the ſalaries of ſchool maſters to be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented from a diminution of uſeleſs ſine cures, how might it turn to the advantage of this people; a people whom, without flattery, I may, in other reſpects, term the wiſeſt and greateſt upon earth. But while I would reward the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, I would diſmiſs thoſe utterly unqualified for their employment: In ſhort, I would make the buſineſs of a ſchool maſter every way more reſpectable, by encreaſing their ſalaries, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting only men of proper abilities.</p>
               <p>There are already ſchool maſters appointed, and they have ſome ſmall ſalaries; but where at preſent there is but one ſchool maſter appointed, there ſhould at leaſt be two; and wherever the ſalary is at preſent twenty pounds, it ſhould be an hundred. Do we give immoderate benefices
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0201400800:164"/>
to thoſe who inſtruct ourſelves, and ſhall we deny even ſubſiſtence to thoſe who inſtruct our children. Every member of ſociety ſhould be paid in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he is neceſſary; and I will be bold enough to ſay, that ſchool maſters in a ſtate, are more neceſſary than clergymen, as children ſtand in more need of inſtruction than their parents.</p>
               <p>But inſtead of this, as I have already obſerved, we ſend them to board in the country to the moſt ignorant ſet of men that can be imagined. But leaſt the ignorance of the maſter be not ſufficient, the child is generally conſigned to the uſher. This is generally ſome poor needy animal, little ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to a footman either in learning or ſpirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to his place by an advertiſement, and kept there merely from his being of a complying diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and making the children fond of him. <hi>You give your child to be educated to a ſlave,</hi> ſays a philoſopher to a rich man; <hi>Inſtead of one ſlave, you will then have two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It were well, however, if parents, upon fixing their children in one of theſe houſes, would exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the abilities of the uſher as well as the maſter; for, whatever they are told to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the uſher is generally the perſon moſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in their education. If then, a gentleman, upon putting out his ſon to one of theſe houſes, ſees the uſher diſregarded by the maſter, he may
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0201400800:165"/>
depend upon it, that he is equally diſregarded by the boys; the truth is, in ſpite of all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to pleaſe, they are generally the laughing ſtock of the ſchool. Every trick is played upon the uſher; the oddity of his manners, his dreſs, or his language, are a fund of eternal ridicule; the maſter himſelf now and then cannot avoid joining in the laugh, and the poor wretch, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſenting this ill uſage, ſeems to live in a ſtate of war with all the family. This is a very proper perſon, is it not, to give children a reliſh for learning? They muſt eſteem learning very much, when they ſee its profeſſors uſed with ſuch ceremony. If the uſher be deſpiſed, the father may be aſſured his child will never be properly inſtructed.</p>
               <p>But let me ſuppoſe, that there are ſome ſchools without theſe inconveniencies, where the maſter and uſhers are men of learning, reputation and aſſiduity. If there are to be found ſuch, they cannot be prized in a ſtate ſufficiently. A boy will learn more true wiſdom in a public ſchool in a year, than by a private education in five. It is not from maſters, but from their equals, youth learn a knowledge of the world; the little tricks they play each other, the puniſhment that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attends the commiſſion, is a juſt picture of the great world, and all the ways of men are practiſed in a public ſchool in miniature. It is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0201400800:166"/>
true, a child is early made acquainted with ſome vices in a ſchool, but it is better to know theſe when a boy, than be firſt taught them when a man, for their novelty then may have irreſiſtible charms.</p>
               <p>In a public education, boys early learn tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; and if the parents and friends would give them leſs money upon their uſual viſits, it would be much to their advantage, ſince it may juſtly be ſaid, that a great part of their diſorders ariſe from ſurfeit, <hi>Plus occidit gula quam gladius.</hi> And now I am come to the article of health, it may not be amiſs to obſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Mr. Locke, and ſome others, have adviſed that children ſhould be inured to cold, to fatigue, and hardſhip, from their youth; but Mr. Locke was but an indifferent phyſician. Habit, I grant, has great influence over our conſtitutions, but we have not preciſe ideas upon this ſubject.</p>
               <p>We know, that among ſavages, and even among our peaſants, there are found children born with ſuch conſtitutions, that they croſs ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers by ſwimming, endure cold, thirſt, hunger, and want of ſleep, to a ſurprizing degree; that when they happen to fall ſick, they are cured without the help of medicine, by nature alone. Such examples are adduced to perſuade us to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their manner of education, and accuſtom
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0201400800:167"/>
ourſelves betimes to ſupport the ſame fatigues. But had theſe gentlemen conſidered firſt, that thoſe ſavages and peaſants are generally not ſo long lived as they who have led a more indolent life: Secondly, that the more laborious the life is, the leſs populous is the country. Had they conſidered, that what phyſicians call the <hi>ſtamina vitae,</hi> by fatigue and labour, become rigid, and thus anticipate old age. That the number who ſurvive thoſe rude trials, bears no proportion to thoſe who die in the experiment. Had theſe things been properly conſidered, they would not have thus extolled an education begun in fatigue and hardſhips. Peter the Great, willing to enure the children of his ſeamen to a life of hardſhip, ordered that they ſhould only drink ſea water, but they unfortunately all died under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</p>
               <p>But while I would exclude all unneceſſary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, yet ſtill I would recommend temperance in the higheſt degree. No luxurious diſhes with high ſeaſoning, nothing given children to force an appetite, as little ſugared or ſalted proviſions as poſſible, though never ſo pleaſing; but milk, morning and night, ſhould be their conſtant food. This diet would make them more healthy than any of thoſe ſlops that are uſually cooked by the miſtreſs of a boarding ſchool; beſides, it corrects
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0201400800:168"/>
any conſumptive habits, not unfrequently found amongſt the children of city parents.</p>
               <p>As boys ſhould be educated with temperance, ſo the firſt greateſt leſſon that ſhould be taught them is, to admire frugality. It is by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this virtue alone, they can ever expect to be uſeful members of ſociety. It is true, lectures continually repeated upon this ſubject, may make ſome boys when they grow up, run into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, and become miſers; but it were well, had we more miſers than we have among us. I know few characters more uſeful in ſociety, for a man's having a larger or ſmaller ſhare of money lying uſeleſs by him, no way injures the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; ſince, ſhould every miſer now exhauſt his ſtores, this might make gold more plenty, but it would not encreaſe the commodities or pleaſures of life; they would ſtill remain as they are at preſent; it matters not, therefore, whether men are miſers or not, if they be only frugal, labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and fill the ſtation they have choſen. If they deny themſelves the neceſſaries of life, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is no way injured by their folly.</p>
               <p>Inſtead, therefore, of romances, which praiſe young men of ſpirit, who go through a variety of adventures, and at laſt conclude a life of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, folly, and extravagance in riches and matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, there ſhould be ſome men of wit employed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0201400800:169"/>
to compoſe books that might equally intereſt the paſſions of our youth, where ſuch an one might be praiſed for having reſiſted allurements when young, and how he at laſt became lord mayor; how he was married to a lady of great ſenſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and beauty; to be as explicit as poſſible, the old ſtory of Whittington, were his cat left out, might be more ſerviceable to the tender mind, than either Tom Jones, Joſeph Andrews, or an hundred others, where frugality is the only good quality the hero is not poſſeſſed of. Were our ſchool-maſters, if any of them have ſenſe enough to daw up ſuch a work, thus employed it would be much more ſerviceable to their pupils than all the grammars and dictionaries they may publiſh theſe ten years.</p>
               <p>Children ſhould early be inſtructed in the arts from which they would afterwards draw the greateſt advantages. When the wonders of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are never expoſed to our view, we have no great deſire to become acquainted with thoſe parts of learning which pretend to account for the phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena. One of the ancients complains, that as ſoon as young men have left ſchool, and are obliged to converſe in the world, they fancy themſelves tranſported into a new region. <hi>Ut cum in forum venerarint exiſtiment ſe in alium ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum orbem delatos.</hi> We ſhould early, therefore, inſtruct them in the experiments, if I may ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0201400800:170"/>
it, of knowledge, and leave to maturer age the accounting for the cauſes. But, inſtead of that, when boys begin natural philoſophy in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, they have not the leaſt curioſity for thoſe parts of the ſcience which are propoſed for their inſtruction; they have never before ſeen the phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, and conſequently have no curioſity to learn the reaſons. Might natural philoſophy, therefore, be made their paſtime in ſchool, by this means it would in college become their amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>In ſeveral of the machines now in uſe, there would be ample field both for inſtruction and amuſement; the different ſorts of the phoſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, the artificial pyrites, magnetiſm, electricity, the experiments upon the rarefaction and weight of the air, and thoſe upon elaſtic bodies, might employ their idle hours, and none ſhould be called from play to ſee ſuch experiments but ſuch as thought proper. At firſt then it would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient if the inſtruments, and the effects of their combination, were only ſhewn; the cauſes ſhould be deferred to a maturer age, or to thoſe times when natural curioſity prompts us to diſcover the wonders of nature. Man is placed in this world as a ſpectator; when he is tired with wondering at all the novelties about him, and not till then, does he deſire to be made acquainted with the cauſes that create thoſe wonders.</p>

                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0201400800:171"/>What I have obſerved with regard to natural philoſophy, I would extend to every other ſcience whatſoever. We ſhould teach them as many of the facts as were poſſible, and defer the cauſes until they ſeemed of themſelves deſirous of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. A mind thus leaving ſchool, ſtored with all the ſimple experiences of ſcience, would be the fitteſt in the world for the college courſe; and though ſuch a youth might not appear ſo bright, or ſo talkative, as thoſe who had learned the real principles and cauſes of ſome of the ſciences, yet he would make a wiſer man, and would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a more laſting paſſion for letters than he who was early burdened with the diſagreeable inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of effect and cauſe.</p>
               <p>In hiſtory, ſuch ſtories alone ſhould be laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them as might catch the imagination; inſtead of this, they are too frequently obliged to toil through the four empires, as they are called, where their memories are burdened by a number of diſguſting names, that deſtroy all their future reliſh for our beſt hiſtorians, who may be termed the trueſt teachers of wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Every ſpecies of flattery ſhould be carefully avoided; a boy who happens to ſay a ſprightly thing is generally applauded ſo much, that he happens to continue a coxcomb ſometimes all his life after. He is reputed a wit at fourteen, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0201400800:172"/>
becomes a blockhead at twenty. Nurſes, footmen, and ſuch, ſhould therefore be driven away as much as poſſible. I was even going to add, that the mother herſelf ſhould ſtifle her pleaſure, or her vanity, when little maſter happens to ſay a good or a ſmart thing. Thoſe modeſt lubberly boys, who ſeem to want ſpirit, generally go through their buſineſs with more eaſe to themſelves, and more ſatisfaction to their inſtructors.</p>
               <p>There has of late a gentleman appeared, who thinks the ſtudy of rhetoric eſſential to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect education. That bold male eloquence, which often, without pleaſing, convinces, is generally deſtroyed by ſuch inſtitutions. Convincing elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, however, is infinitely more ſerviceable to its poſſeſſor than the moſt florid harangue or the moſt pathetic tones that can be imagined; and the man who is thoroughly convinced himſelf who underſtands his ſubject, and the language he ſpeaks in, will be more apt to ſilence oppoſition, than he who ſtudies the force of his periods, and fills our ears with ſounds, while our minds are deſtitute of conviction.</p>
               <p>It was reckoned the fault of the orators at the decline of the Roman empire, when they had been long inſtructed by rhetoricians, that their periods were ſo harmonious, as that they could be ſung as well as ſpoken. What a ridiculous figure
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0201400800:173"/>
muſt one of theſe gentlemen cut, thus meaſuring ſyllables, and weighing words, when he ſhould plead the cauſe of his client! Two architects were once candidates for the building a certain temple at Athens; the firſt harangued the crowd very learnedly upon the different orders of archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, and ſhewed them in what manner the temple ſhould be built; the other, who got up to ſpeak after him, only obſerved, that what his brother had ſpoken he could do; and thus he at once gained his cauſe.</p>
               <p>To teach men to be orators, is little leſs than to teach them to be poets; and for my part, I ſhould have too great a regard for my child, to wiſh him a manor only in a bookſeller's ſhop.</p>
               <p>Another paſſion which the preſent age is apt to run into, is to make children learn all things; the languages, the ſciences, muſic, the exerciſes, and painting. Thus the child ſoon becomes a <hi>talker</hi> in all, but a <hi>maſter</hi> in none. He thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a ſuperficial fondneſs for every thing, and only ſhews his ignorance when he attempts to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit his ſkill.</p>
               <p>As I deliver my thoughts without method or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, ſo the reader muſt not be ſurprized to find me once more addreſſing ſchoolmaſters on the preſent
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0201400800:174"/>
method of teaching the learned languages, which is commonly by literal tranſlations. I would aſk ſuch, if they were to travel a journey, whether thoſe parts of the road in which they found the greateſt difficulties would no be moſt ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered? Boys, who, if I may continue the alluſion, gallop through one of the ancients with the aſſiſtance of a tranſlation, can have but a very ſlight acquaintance either with the author or his language. It is by the exerciſe of the mind alone that a language is learned; but a literal tranſlation, on the oppoſite page, leaves no exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe for the memory at all. The boy will not be at the fatigue of remembering, when his doubts are at once ſatisfied by a glance of the eye; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as were every word to be ſought from a dictionary, the learner would attempt to remember them, to ſave him the trouble of looking out for it for the future.</p>
               <p>To continue in the ſame pedantic ſtrain, tho' no ſchoolmaſter, of all the various grammars now taught in the ſchools about town, I would recommend only the old common one; I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got whether Lily's, or an emendation of him. The others may be improvements; but ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements ſeem, to me, only mere grammatical niceties, no way influencing the learner, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps loading him with trifling ſubtilties, which,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0201400800:175"/>
at a proper age, he muſt be at ſome pains to forget.</p>
               <p>Whatever pains a maſter may take to make the learning of the langages agreeable to his pupil, he may depend upon it, it will be at firſt extreamly unpleaſant. The rudiments of every language, therefore, muſt be given as a taſk, not as an amuſement. Attempting to deceive children into inſtruction of this kind, is only deceiving our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and I know no paſſion capable of conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a child's natural lazineſs but fear. Solomon has ſaid it before me; nor is there any more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, tho' perhaps more diſagreeable truth, than the proverb in verſe, too well known to repeat on the preſent occaſion. It is very probable that parents are told of ſome maſters who never uſe the rod, and conſequeetly are thought the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt inſtructors for their children; but though tenderneſs is a requiſite quality in an inſtructor, yet there is too often the trueſt tenderneſs in well-timed correction.</p>
               <p>Some have juſtly obſerved, that all paſſion ſhould be baniſhed on this terrible occaſion; but I know not, there is a frailty attending human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that few maſters are able to keep their temper whilſt they correct. I knew a good-natured man, who was ſenſible of his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this reſpect, and conſequently had recourſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0201400800:176"/>
to the following expedient to prevent his paſſions from being engaged, yet at the ſame time adminiſter juſtice with impartiality. When ever any of his pupils committed a fault, he ſummoned a jury of his peers, I mean of the boys of his own or the next claſſes to him; his accuſers ſtood forth; he had a liberty of pleading in his own defence, and one or two more had a liberty of pleading againſt him: when found guilty by the pannel, he was conſigned to the footman, who attended in the houſe, who had previous orders to uſe his puniſhment with lenity. By this means the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter took off the odium of puniſhment from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and the footman, between whom and the boys there could not be even the ſlighteſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, was placed in ſuch a light as to be ſhunned by every boy in ſchool.</p>
               <p>And now I have gone thus far, perhaps you will think me ſome pedagogue, willing, by a well-timed puff, to encreaſe the reputation of his own ſchool; but ſuch is not the caſe. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard I have for ſociety, for thoſe tender minds who are the objects of the preſent eſſay, ſuch are the only motives I have for offering thoſe thoughts, calculated not to ſurprize by their novelty, or the elegance of compoſition, but merely to remedy ſome defects which have crept into the preſent ſyſtem of ſchool education. If this letter ſhould be inſerted, perhaps I may trouble you, in my next, with ſome thoughts upon an univerſity edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not with an intent to exhauſt the ſubject, but to amend ſome few abuſes.

               <p>AN alehouſe-keeper, near Iſlington, who had long lived at the ſign of the French king, upon the commencement of the laſt war with France, pulled down his old ſign, and put up the queen of Hungary. Under the influence of her red face and golden ſceptre, he continued to ſell ale, till ſhe was no longer the favourite of his cuſtomers; he changed her, therefore, ſome time ago, for the king of Pruſſia, who may probably be changed in turn for the next great man that ſhall be ſet up for vulgar admiration.</p>
               <p>Our publican, in this, imitates the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, who deal out their figures one after the other, to the gazing crowd beneath them. When we have ſufficiently wondered at one, that is taken in, and another exhibited in its room, which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom holds its ſtation long; for the mob are ever pleaſed with variety.</p>
               <p>I muſt own I have ſuch an indifferent opinion of the vulgar, that I am ever led to ſuſpect that

merit which raiſes their ſhout; at leaſt I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to find thoſe great, and ſometimes good men, who find ſatisfaction in ſuch acclamations, made worſe by it; and hiſtory has too frequently taught me, that the head which has grown this day giddy with the roar of the million, has the very next been fixed upon a pole.</p>
               <p>As Alexander VI. was entering a little town in the neighbourhood of Rome, which had been juſt evacuated by the enemy, he perceived the townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men buſy in the market-place in pulling down from a gibbet a figure which had been deſigned to repreſent himſelf. There were alſo ſome knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down a neighbouring ſtatue of one of the Orſini family, with whom he was at war, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to put Alexander's effigy, when taken down, in its place. It is poſſible a man who knew leſs of the world would have condemned the adulation of thoſe barefaced flatterers; but Alexander ſeemed pleaſed at their zeal, and turning to Borgia, his ſon, ſaid with a ſmile, <hi>Vides mi fili quam leve diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimen palibulum inter et ſtatuum.</hi>

               <p>Of all thoſe ſocieties, I know of none whoſe works are worth being known out of the precincts of the city in which they were written, except
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0201400800:190"/>
the Cicalata Academica (or, as we might expreſs it, the tickling ſociety) of Florence. I have juſt now before me a manuſcript oration, ſpoken by the late Tomaſo Crudeli, at that ſociety, which will, at once, ſerve to give a better picture of the manner in which men of wit amuſe themſelves in that country, than any thing I could ſay upon the occaſion. The oration is this:</p>
               <p>"The younger the nymph, my dear companions, the more happy the lover. From fourteen to ſeventeen, you are ſure of finding love for love; from ſeventeen to twenty one, there is always a mixture of intereſt and affection. But when that period is paſt, no longer expect to receive, but to buy. No longer expect a nymph who gives, but who ſells her favours. At this age, every glance is taught its duty; not a look, not a ſigh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſign; the lady, like a ſkilful warrior, aims at the heart of another, while ſhe ſhields her own from danger.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, at fifteen, you may expect nothing but ſimplicity, innocence and nature. The paſſions are then ſincere; the ſoul ſeems ſeated in the lips; the dear object feels preſent happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without being anxious for the future; her eyes brighten if her lover approaches; her ſmiles are borrowed from the graces, and her very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes ſeem to complete her deſires.</p>
               <p>Lucretia was juſt ſixteen. The roſe and lilly took poſſeſſion of her face, and her boſom, by its hue and its coldneſs, ſeemed covered with
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0201400800:191"/>
ſnow. So much beauty, and ſo much virtue, ſeldom want admirers. Orlandino, a youth of ſenſe and merit, was among the number. He had long languiſhed for an opportunity of declaring his paſſion, when Cupid, as if willing to indulge his happineſs, brought the charming young couple by mere accident to an arbour, where every pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye, but that of love, was abſent. Orlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dino talked of the ſincerity of his paſſion, and mixed flattery with his addreſſes; but it was all in vain. The nymph was pre-engaged, and had long devoted to heaven thoſe charms for which he ſued. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"My dear Orlandino, ſaid ſhe, you know I have long been dedicated to St. Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and to her belongs all that lies below my girdle; all that is above, you may freely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, but farther I cannot, muſt not, comply. The vow is paſſed; I wiſh it were undone, but now it is impoſſible."</q> You may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, my companions, the embarraſſment our young lovers felt upon this occaſion. They kneeled to St. Catherine, and though both deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, both implored her aſſiſtance. Their tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſaint was entreated to ſhew ſome expedient, by which both might continue to love, and yet both be happy. Their petition was ſincere. St. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine was touched with compaſſion; for lo, a miracle! Lucretia's girdle unlooſed, as if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands; and though before bound round her middle, fell ſpontaneouſly down to her feet, and gave Orlandino the poſſeſſion of all thoſe beauties which lay above it,"</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all kinds of ſucceſs, that of an orator is the moſt pleaſing. Upon other occaſions, the applauſe we deſerve is conferred in our abſence, and we are inſenſible of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we have given; but in eloquence, the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and the triumph are inſeparable. We read our own glory in the face of every ſpectator, the audience is moved, the antagoniſt is defeated, and the whole circle burſts into unſolicited applauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0201400800:193"/>The rewards which attend excellence in this way are ſo pleaſing, that numbers have written profeſſed treatiſes to teach us the art; ſchools have been eſtabliſhed with no other intent; rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric has taken place among the inſtitutions, and pedants have ranged under proper heads, and diſtinguiſhed with long learned names, <hi>ſome</hi> of the ſtrokes of nature, or of paſſion, which ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have uſed. I ſay only <hi>ſome</hi> for a folio volume could not contain all the figures which have been uſed by the truly eloquent, and ſcarce a good ſpeaker or writer, but makes uſe of ſome that are peculiar or new.</p>
               <p>Eloquence has preceded the rules of rhetoric, as languages have been formed before grammar. Nature renders men eloquent in great intereſts, or great paſſions. He that is ſenſibly touched, ſees things with a very different eye from the reſt of mankind. All nature to him becomes an object of compariſon and metaphor, without attending to it; he throws life into all, and inſpires his audience with a part of his own enthuſiaſm.</p>
               <p>It has been remarked, that the lower parts of mankind generally expreſs themſelves moſt figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and that tropes are found in the moſt ordinary forms of converſation. Thus, in every language, the heart burns; the courage is rouzed;
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0201400800:194"/>
the eyes ſparkle; the ſpirits are caſt down; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion enflames; pride ſwells, and pity ſinks the ſoul. Nature, every where, ſpeaks in thoſe ſtrong images, which, from their frequency, paſs unnoticed.</p>
               <p>Nature it is which inſpires thoſe rapturous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſms, thoſe irreſiſtible turns; a ſtrong paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a preſſing danger, calls up all the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gives the orator irreſiſtible force. Thus, a captain of the firſt caliphs, ſeeing his ſoldiers fly, cried out, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Whither do you run? the enemy are not there! You have been told that the caliph is dead; but God is ſtill living. He regards the brave, and will reward the coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous. Advance!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A man, therefore, may be called eloquent, who transfers the paſſion or ſentiment with which he is moved himſelf, into the breaſt of another</hi>; and this definition appears the more juſt, as it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the graces of ſilence, and of action. An intimate perſuaſion of the truth to be proved, is the ſentiment and paſſion to be transferred; and he who effects this, is truly poſſeſſed of the talent of eloquence.</p>
               <p>I have called eloquence a talent, and not an art, as ſo many rhetoricians have done, as art is acquired by exerciſe and ſtudy, and eloquence is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0201400800:195"/>
the gift of nature. Rutes will never make either a work or a diſcourſe eloquent; they only ſerve to prevent faults, but not to introduce beauties; to prevent thoſe paſſages which are truly eloquent, and dictated by nature from being blended with others, which might diſguſt, or, at leaſt, abate our paſſion.</p>
               <p>What we clearly conceive, (ſays Boileau) we can clearly expreſs. I may add, that what is felt with emotion, is expreſſed alſo with the ſame movements; the words ariſe as readily to paint our emotions, as to expreſs our thoughts with perſpicuity. The cool care an orator takes to expreſs paſſions which he does not feel, only prevents his riſing into that paſſion he would ſeem to feel. In a word, to feel your ſubject tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly, and to ſpeak without fear, are the only rules of eloquence, properly ſo called, which I can offer. Examine a writer of genius on the moſt beautiful parts of his work, and he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways aſſure you that ſuch paſſages are generally thoſe which have given him the leaſt trouble, for they came as if by inſpiration. To pretend that cold and didactic precepts will make a man elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, is only to prove that he is incapable of eloquence.</p>
               <p>But, as in being perſpicuous, it is neceſſary to have a full idea of the ſubject, ſo in being elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0201400800:196"/>
it is not ſufficient, if I may ſo expreſs it, to feel by halves. The orator ſhould be ſtrongly impreſſed, which is generally the effects of a fine and exquiſite ſenſibility, and not that tranſient and ſuperficial emotion, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites in the greateſt part of his audience. It is even impoſſible to affect the hearers in any great degree, without being affected ourſelves. In vain it will be objected, that many writers have had the art to inſpire their readers with a paſſion for virtue, without being virtuous themſelves; ſince it may be anſwered, that ſentiments of virtue filled their minds at the time they were writing. They felt the inſpiration ſtrongly, while they praiſed juſtice, generoſity, or good nature; but, unhappily for them, theſe paſſions might have been diſcontinued, when they laid down the pen. In vain will it be objected again, that we can move without being moved, as we can convince, without being convinced. It is much eaſier to deceive our reaſon than ourſelves; a trifling defect in reaſoning, may be overſeen, and lead a man aſtray; for it requires reaſon and time to detect the falſhood, but our paſſions are not ſo eaſily impoſed upon, our eyes, our ears, and every ſenſe, is watchful to detect the impoſture.</p>
               <p>No diſcourſe can be eloquent, that does not elevate the mind. Pathetic eloquence, it is true, has for its only object to affect; but I appeal to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0201400800:197"/>
men of ſenſibility, whether their pathetic feelings are not accompanied with ſome degree of eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We may then call eloquence and ſublimity the ſame thing, ſince it is impoſſible to be one, without feeling the other. From hence it follows, that we may be eloquent in any language, ſince no language refuſes to paint thoſe ſentiments with which we are thoroughly impreſſed. What is uſually called ſublimity of ſtile, ſeems to be only an error. Eloquence is not in the words, but in the ſubject, and in great concerns, the more ſimply any thing is expreſſed, it is generally the more ſublime. True eloquence does not conſiſt, as the rhetoricians aſſure us, in ſaying great things in a ſublime ſtyle, but in a ſimple ſtyle; for there is, properly ſpeaking, no ſuch thing as a ſublime ſtyle, the ſublimity lies only in the things; and when they are not ſo, the language may be turgid, affected, metaphorical, but not affecting.</p>
               <p>What can be more ſimply expreſſed, than the following extract from a celebrated preacher, and yet what was ever more ſublime? Speaking of the ſmall number of the elect, he breaks out thus among his audience: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Let me ſuppoſe that this was the laſt hour of us all; that the heavens were opening over our heads; that time was paſſed, and eternity begun; that Jeſus Chriſt in all his glory, that man of ſorrows in all his glory, appeared on the tribunal, and that we
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0201400800:198"/>
were aſſembled here to receive our final decree of life or death eternal! Let me aſk, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with terror like you, and not ſeparating my lot from yours, but putting myſelf in the ſame ſituation in which we muſt all one day appear before God, our judge. Let me aſk, if Jeſus Chriſt ſhould now appear to make the terrible ſeparation of the juſt from the unjuſt, do you think the greateſt number would be ſaved? Do you think the number of the elect would even be equal to that of the ſinners? Do you think, if all our works were examined with juſtice, would he find ten juſt perſons in this great aſſembly? Monſters of ingratitude would he find one?"</q> Such paſſages as theſe, are ſublime in every language. The expreſſion may be leſs ſtriking, or more indiſtinct, but the greatneſs of the idea ſtill remains. In a word, we may be eloquent in every language and in every ſtyle, ſince elocution is only an aſſiſtant, but not a conſtitutor of eloquence.</p>
               <p>Of what uſe, then, will it be ſaid, are all the precepts given us upon this head, both by the antients and moderns? I anſwer, that they cannot make us eloquent, but they will certainly prevent us from becoming ridiculous. They can ſeldom procure a ſingle beauty, but they may baniſh a thouſand faults. The true method of an orator, is not to attempt always to move, always to affect,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0201400800:199"/>
to be continually ſublime, but at proper intervals to give reſt both to his own and the paſſions of his audience. In theſe periods of relaxation, or of preparation rather, rules may teach him to avoid any thing low, trivial, or diſguſting. Thus criticiſm, properly ſpeaking, is intended not to aſſiſt thoſe parts which are ſublime, but thoſe which are naturally mean and humble, which are compoſed with coolneſs and caution, and where the orator rather endeavours not to offend, than attempts to pleaſe.</p>
               <p>I have hitherto inſiſted more ſtrenuouſly on that eloquence which ſpeaks to the paſſions, as it is a ſpecies of oratory almoſt unknown in England. At the bar it is quite diſcontinued, and I think with juſtice. In the ſenate, it is uſed but ſparingly, as the orator ſpeaks to enlightened judges. But in the pulpit, in which the orator ſhould chiefly addreſs the vulgar, it ſeems ſtrange, that it ſhould be entirely laid aſide.</p>
               <p>The vulgar of England are without exception, the moſt barbarous and the moſt unknowing of any in Europe. A great part of their ignorance may be chiefly aſcribed to their teachers, who, with the moſt pretty gentleman-like ſerenity, deliver their cool diſcourſes, and addreſs the reaſon of men, who have never reaſoned in all their lives. They are told of cauſe and effect, of beings ſelf
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0201400800:200"/>
exiſtent, and the univerſal ſcale of beings. They are informed of the excellence of the Bangorian controverſy, and the abſurdity of an intermediate ſtate. The ſpruce preacher reads his lucubration without lifting his noſe from the text, and never ventures to earn the ſhame of an enthuſiaſt.</p>
               <p>By this means, though his audience feel not one word of all he ſays, he earns, however, among his acquaintance, the character of a man of ſenſe; among his acquaintance only did I ſay, nay, even with his biſhop.</p>
               <p>The polite of every country have ſeveral mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to induce them to a rectitude of action; the love of virtue for its own ſake, the ſhame of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, and the deſire of pleaſing. The vulgar have but one, the enforcements of religion; and yet thoſe who ſhould puſh this motive home to their hearts, are baſely found to deſert their poſt. They ſpeak to the ſquire, the philoſopher, and the pedant; but the poor, thoſe who really want inſtruction, are left uninſtructed.</p>
               <p>I have attended moſt of our pulpit orators, who, it muſt be owned, write extremely well upon the text they aſſume. To give them their due alſo, they read their ſermons with elegance and propriety, but this goes but a very ſhort way in true eloquence. The ſpeaker muſt be moved.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0201400800:201"/>
In this, in this alone, our Engliſh divines are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Were they to ſpeak to a few calm diſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate hearers, they certainly uſe the propereſt methods of addreſs; but their audience is chiefly compoſed of the poor, who muſt be influenced by motives of reward and puniſhment, and whoſe only virtues lie in ſelf-intereſt or fear.</p>
               <p>How then are ſuch to be addreſſed; not by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died periods, or cold diſquiſitions; not by the labours of the head, but the honeſt ſpontaneous dictates of the heart. Neither writing a ſermon with regular periods and all the harmony of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant expreſſion; neither reading it with emphaſis, propriety, and deliberation; neither pleaſing with metaphor, ſimile, or rhetorical fuſtian; neither arguing coolly, and untying conſequences united in <hi>a priori,</hi> nor bundling up inductions <hi>a poſteriori</hi>; neither pedantic jargon, nor academical trifling, can perſuade the poor; writing a diſcourſe coolly in the cloſet, then getting it by memory, and delivering it on Sundays, even that will not do. What then is to be done? I know of no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to ſpeak; to ſpeak at once intelligibly, and feelingly, except to underſtand the language. To be convinced of the truth of the object; to be perfectly acquainted with the ſubject in view, to prepoſſeſs yourſelf with a low opinion of your audience, and to do the reſt extempore. By this means ſtrong expreſſions, new thoughts, riſing
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0201400800:202"/>
paſſions, and the true declamatory ſtyle, will naturally enſue.</p>
               <p>Fine declamation does not conſiſt in flowery periods, delicate alluſions, or muſical cadences; but in a plain, open, looſe ſtile, where the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods are long and obvious; where the ſame thought is often exhibited in ſeveral points of view; all this, ſtrong ſenſe, a good memory, and a ſmall ſhare of experience, will furniſh to every orator; and without theſe a clergyman may be called a fine preacher, a judicious preacher, and a man of ſound ſenſe; he may make his hearers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his underſtanding, but will ſeldom enlighten theirs.</p>
               <p>When I think of the Methodiſt preachers among us, how ſeldom they are endued with common ſenſe, and yet how often and how juſtly they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their hearers, I cannot avoid ſaying within myſelf, had theſe been bred gentlemen, and been endued with even the meaneſt ſhare of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what might they not effect! Did our biſhops, who can add dignity to their expoſtulations, teſtify the ſame fervour, and <hi>entreat</hi> their hearers, as well as <hi>argue,</hi> what might not be the conſequence! The vulgar, by which I mean the bulk of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, would then have a double motive to love religion, firſt from ſeeing its profeſſors honoured here, and next from the conſequences here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0201400800:203"/>
At preſent, the enthuſiaſms of the poor are oppoſed to law; did law conſpire with their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſms, we ſhould not only be the happieſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon earth, but the wiſeſt alſo.</p>
               <p>Enthuſiaſm in religion, which prevails only among the vulgar, ſhould be the chief object of politics. A ſociety of enthuſiaſts, governed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon among the great, is the moſt indiſſoluble, the moſt virtuous, and the moſt efficient of its own decrees that can be imagined. Every country that has any degree of ſtrength, have had their enthuſiaſms, which ever ſerve as laws among the people. The Greeks had their <hi>Kalokagathia,</hi> the Romans their <hi>Amor Patriae,</hi> and we the truer and firmer bond of the <hi>Proteſtant religion.</hi> The principle is the ſame in all; how much then is it the duty of thoſe whom the law has appointed teachers of this religion to enforce its obligations, and to raiſe thoſe enthuſiaſms among people, by which alone political ſociety can ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p>From eloquence, therefore, the morals of our people are to expect emendation; but how little can they be improved, by men who get into the pulpit rather to ſhew their parts, than convince us of the truth of what they deliver, who are pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully correct in their ſtile, muſical in their tones, where every ſentiment, every expreſſion, ſeems the reſult of meditation and deep ſtudy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0201400800:204"/>Tillotſon has been commended as the model of pulpit eloquence; thus far he ſhould be imitated, where he generally ſtrives to convince, rather than to pleaſe: but to adopt his long, dry, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tedious diſcuſſions, which ſerve to amuſe only divines, and are utterly neglected by the generality of mankind, to praiſe the intricacy of his periods, which are too long to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to continue his cool phlegmatic manner of enforcing every truth, is certainly erroneous. As I ſaid before, the good preacher ſhould adopt no model, write no ſermons, ſtudy no periods; let him but underſtand his ſubject, the language he ſpeaks, and be convinced of the truths he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers. It is amazing to what heights eloquence of this kind may reach! This is that eloquence the ancients repreſented as lightning, bearing down every oppoſer; this the power which has turned whole aſſemblies into aſtoniſhment, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and awe, that is deſcribed by the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, the flame, and every other inſtance of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible impetuoſity.</p>
               <p>But to attempt ſuch noble heights, belongs only to the truly great, or the truly good. To diſcard the lazy manner of reading ſermons, or ſpeaking ſermons by rote; to ſet up ſingly againſt the oppoſition of men who are attached to their own errors, and to endeavour to be great, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being prudent, are qualities we ſeldom

               <p>WHAT, ſay ſome, can give us a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible idea of a large ſtate than to find it moſtly governed by cuſtom; to have few writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten laws, and no boundaries to mark the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction between the ſenate and people? Among the number who ſpeak in this manner is the great Monteſquieu, who aſſerts that every nation is free in proportion to the number of its written laws, and ſeems to hint at a deſpotic and arbitrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the preſent king of Pruſſia, who has abridged the laws of his country into a very ſhort compaſs.</p>
               <p>As Tacitus and Monteſquieu happen to differ in ſentiment upon a ſubject of ſo much importance (for the Roman expreſly aſſerts, that the ſtate is generally vicious in proportion to the number of its laws) it will not be amiſs to examine it a little more minutely, and ſee whether a ſtate, which, like England, is burdened with a multiplicity of written laws, or which, like Switzerland, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva, and ſome other republics, is governed by cuſtom, and the determination of the judge is beſt.</p>
               <p>And to prove the ſuperiority of cuſtom to written law, we ſhall at leaſt find hiſtory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0201400800:209"/>
Cuſtom, or the traditional obſervance of the practice of their forefathers, was what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the Romans, as well in their public as private determinations.

               <p>As getting the ancients on our ſide is half a victory, it will not be amiſs to fortify the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with an obſervation of Chryſoſtom's: <hi>That the enſlaved are the fitteſt to be governed by laws, and free men by cuſtom.</hi> Cuſtom partakes of the nature of parental injunction; it is kept by the people themſelves, and obſerved with a willing obedience. The obſervance of it muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be a mark of freedom, and coming origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to a ſtate from the reverenced founders of its liberty, will be an encouragement and aſſiſtance to it in the defence of that bleſſing; but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered people, a nation of ſlaves, muſt pretend to none of this freedom, or theſe happy diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, having, by degeneracy, loſt all right to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0201400800:210"/>
their brave forefathers free inſtitutions, their maſters will in policy take the forfeiture; and the fixing a conqueſt muſt be done by giving laws which may every moment ſerve to remind the people enſlaved of their conquerors, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more dangerous than to truſt a late-ſubdued people with old cuſtoms, that preſently upbraid their degeneracy, and provoke them to revolt.</p>
               <p>The wiſdom of the Roman republic, in their veneration for cuſtom, and backwardneſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a new law, was perhaps the cauſe of their long continuance, and of the virtues of which they have ſet the world ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. But to ſhew in what that wiſdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, it may be proper to obſerve, that the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of new written laws are merely confined to the conſequences of their obſervance; but cuſtomary laws, keeping up a veneration for the founders, engage men in the imitation of their virtues, as well as policy. To this may be aſcribed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious regard the Romans paid to their forefathers memory, and their adhering for ſo many ages to the practice of the ſame virtues, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contributed more to efface than the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a voluminous body of new laws over the neck of venerable cuſtom.</p>
               <p>The ſimplicity, conciſeneſs, and antiquity of cuſtom gives an air of majeſty and immutability
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0201400800:211"/>
that inſpires awe and veneration; but new laws are too apt to be voluminous, perplexed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate; from whence muſt neceſſarily ariſe neglect, contempt, and ignorance.</p>
               <p>As every human inſtitution is ſubject to groſs imperfections, ſo laws muſt neceſſarily be liable to the ſame inconveniences, and their defects ſoon diſcovered. Thus, through the weakneſs of one part, all the reſt are liable to be brought into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. But ſuch weakneſſes in a cuſtom, for very obvious reaſons, evade an examination; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a friendly prejudice always ſtands up in their favour.</p>
               <p>But let us ſuppoſe a new law to be perfectly equitable and neceſſary; yet, if the procurers of it have betrayed a conduct that confeſſes bye-ends and private motives, the diſguſt to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances diſpoſes us, unreaſonably indeed, to an irreverence of the law itſelf; but we are indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently blind to the moſt viſible imperfections of an old cuſtom. Though we perceive the defects ourſelves, yet we remain perſuaded that our wiſe forefathers had good reaſons for what they did; and though ſuch motives no longer continue, the benefit will ſtill go along with the obſervance, though we don't know how. It is thus the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lawyers ſpeak, <hi>Non omnium quae a majoribus conſtituta ſunt ratio reddi poteſt, et ideo rationes
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0201400800:212"/>
eorum quae conſtituuntur inquiri non oportet, alia quin multa ex his quae certa ſunt ſubvertuntur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe laws which preſerve to themſelves the greateſt love and obſervance, muſt needs be beſt; but cuſtom, as it executes itſelf, muſt be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſuperior to written laws in this reſpect, which are to be executed by another. Thus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more certain than that numerous written laws are a ſign of a degenerate commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and are frequently not the conſequence of vicious morals in a ſtate, but the cauſes.</p>
               <p>From hence we ſee how much greater benefit it would be to the ſtate rather to abridge than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe its laws. We every day find them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing; acts and reports, which may be termed the acts of judges, are every day becoming more voluminous, and loading the ſubject with new penalties.</p>
               <p>Laws ever encreaſe in number and ſeverity, until they at length are ſtrained ſo tight as to break themſelves. Such was the caſe of the latter em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, whoſe laws were at length become ſo ſtrict, that the barbarous invaders did not bring ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude but liberty.</p>

               <p>OF all the follies and abſurdities which this great metropolis labours under, there is not one, I believe, at preſent, appears in a more glaring and ridiculous light than the pride and luxury of the middling claſs of people; their eager deſire of being ſeen in a ſphere far above their capacities and circumſtances, is daily, nay hourly inſtanced by the prodigious numbers of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics, who flock to the races, and gaming-tables, brothels, and all public diverſions this faſhionable town affords.</p>
               <p>You ſhall ſee a grocer, or a tallow-chandler ſneak from behind the compter, clap on a laced coat and a bag, fly to the E.

               <p>I was led into this reflection by an odd adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which happened to me the other day at Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom

races, where I went, not through any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, I do aſſure you, of laying betts, or winning thouſands; but at the earneſt requeſt of a friend who had long indulged the curioſity of ſeeing the ſport, very natural for an Engliſhman. When we had arrived at the courſe, and had taken ſeveral turns to obſerve the different objects that made up this whimſical groupe, a figure ſuddenly darted by us, mounted and dreſſed in all the elegance of thoſe polite gentry who come to ſhew you they have a little money, and rather than pay their juſt debts at home, generouſly come abroad to beſtow it on gamblers and pickpockets. As I had not an opportunity of viewing his face till his return, I gently walked after him, and met him as he came back, when, to my no ſmall ſurpriſe, I beheld, in this gay Narciſſus, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Jack Varniſh, an humble vender of prints. Diſguſted at the ſight, I pulled my friend by the ſleeve, preſſed him to return home, telling him all the way, that I was ſo enraged at the fellow's impudence, I was reſolved never to lay out an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other penny with him.</p>
               <p>And now, pray ſir, let me beg of you to give this a place in your paper, that Mr. Varniſh may underſtand he miſtakes the thing quite, if he imagines horſe-racing commendable in a tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and that he who is revelling every night in the arms of a common ſtrumpet (though

He will find himſelf ſoon miſtaken, his finances decreaſe, his friends ſhun him, cuſtomers fall off, and himſelf thrown into a Gaol.

               <head>SABINUS and OLINDA.</head>
               <p>IN a fair, rich and flouriſhing country, whoſe clifts are waſhed by the German ocean, lived Sabinus, a youth formed by nature to make a conqueſt wherever he thought proper; but the conſtancy of his diſpoſition fixed him only with Olinda. He was, indeed, ſuperior to her in fortune, but that defect on her ſide was ſo amply ſupplied by her merit, that none was thought more worthy of his regards than ſhe. He loved her, he was beloved by her; and, in a ſhort time, by joining hands publickly, they avowed the union of their hearts. But, alas! none, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fortunate, however happy, are exempt from the ſhafts of envy, and the malignant effects of ungoverned appetite. How unſafe, how deteſtable, are they, who have this fury for their guide. How certainly will it lead them from themſelves, and plunge them in errors they would have ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, even in apprehenſion. Ariana, a lady of many amiable qualities, very nearly allied to Sabinus, and highly eſteemed by him, imagined herſelf ſlighted, and injuriouſly treated, ſince his marriage with Olinda. By uncautiouſly ſuffering this jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy to corrode in her breaſt, ſhe began to give a looſe to paſſion; ſhe forgot thoſe many virtues, for which the had been ſo long, and ſo juſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0201400800:217"/>
Cauſeleſs ſuſpicion, and miſtaken reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, betrayed her, into all the gloom of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; ſhe ſighed without ceaſing; the happineſs of others gave her intolerable pain; ſhe thought of nothing but revenge. How unlike what ſhe was, the chearful, the prudent, the compaſſionate Ariana!</p>
               <p>She continually laboured to diſturb an union ſo firmly, ſo affectionately founded, and planned every ſcheme which ſhe thought moſt likely to diſturb it.</p>
               <p>Fortune ſeemed willing to promote her unjuſt intentions; the circumſtances of Sabinus had been long embarraſſed by a tedious law-ſuit, and the court determining the cauſe unexpectedly in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his opponent, it ſunk his fortune to the loweſt pitch of penury from the higheſt affluence. From the nearneſs of relationſhip, Sabinus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from Ariana thoſe aſſiſtances his preſent ſituation required; but ſhe was inſenſible to all his entreaties, and the juſtice of every remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, unleſs he firſt ſeparated from Olinda, whom ſhe regarded with deteſtation. Upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with her deſires in this reſpect, ſhe promiſed her fortune, her intereſt, and her all, ſhould be at his command. Sabinus was ſhocked at the propoſal; he loved his wife with inexpreſſible tenderneſs, and refuſed thoſe offers with indignation which
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0201400800:218"/>
were to be purchaſed at ſo high a price, Ariana was no leſs diſpleaſed to find her offers rejected, and gave a looſe to all that warmth which ſhe had long endeavoured to ſuppreſs. Reproach gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produces recrimination; the quarrel roſe to ſuch a height, that Sabinus was marked for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and the very next day, upon the ſtrength of an old family debt, he was ſent to gaol, with none but Olinda to comfort him in his miſeries. In this manſion of diſtreſs they lived together with reſignation and even with comfort. She provided the frugal meal, and he read for her while employed in the little offices of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic concern. Their fellow priſoners admired their contentment, and whenever they had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of relaxing into mirth, and enjoying thoſe little comforts that a priſon affords, Sabinus and Olinda were ſure to be of the party. Inſtead of reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other for their mutual wretchedneſs, they both lightened it, by bearing each a ſhare of the load impoſed by providence. Whenever Sabinus ſhewed the leaſt concern on his dear partner's account, ſhe conjured him by the love he bore her, by thoſe tender ties which now united them for ever, not to diſcompoſe himſelf. That, ſo long as his affection laſted, ſhe defied all the ills of fortune, and every loſs of fame or friendſhip. That nothing could make her miſerable, but his ſeeming to want happineſs; nothing pleaſed, but his ſympathiſing with her pleaſure. A continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0201400800:219"/>
in priſon ſoon robbed them of the little they had left, and famine began to make its horrid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; yet ſtill was neither found to murmur; they both looked upon their little boy, who, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of their or his own diſtreſs, was playing about the room, with inexpreſſible yet ſilent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, when a meſſenger came to inform them that Ariana was dead, and that her will, in favour of a very diſtant relation, and who was now in another country, might be eaſily procured, and burnt, in which caſe, all her large fortune would revert to him, as being the next heir at law.</p>
               <p>A propoſal of ſo baſe a nature filled our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy couple with horror; they ordered the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger immediately out of the room, and falling upon each other's neck, indulged an agony of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; for now even all hopes of relief were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. The meſſenger who made the propoſal, however, was only a ſpy ſent by Ariana to ſound the diſpoſitions of a man ſhe loved at once and perſecuted. This lady, though warped by wrong paſſions, was naturally kind, judicious, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. She found that all her attempts to ſhake the conſtancy or the integrity of Sabinus were inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; ſhe had, therefore, begun to reflect, and to wonder, how ſhe could, ſo long, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked, injure ſuch uncommon fortitude and affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0201400800:220"/>She had, from the next room, herſelf heard the reception given to the meſſenger, and could not avoid feeling all the force of ſuperior virtue; ſhe, therefore, reaſſumed her former goodneſs of heart; ſhe came into the room with tears in her eyes, and acknowledged the ſeverity of her former treatment. She beſtowed her firſt care in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding them all the neceſſary ſupplies, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged them as the moſt deſerving heirs of her fortune. From this moment Sabinus enjoyed an uninterrupted happineſs with Olinda, and both were happy in the friendſhip and aſſiſtance of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana, who dying ſoon after, left them in poſſeſſion of a large eſtate, and, in her laſt moments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that virtue was the only path to true glory; and that, however innocence may for a time be depreſſed, a ſteady perſeverence will, in time, lead it to a certain victory.</p>

               <head>THE SENTIMENTS OF A FRENCHMAN ON THE TEMPER of the ENGLISH.</head>
               <p>NOTHING is ſo uncommon among the Engliſh, as that eaſy affability, that inſtant method of acquaintance, or that chearfulneſs of diſpoſition, which make in France the charm of every ſociety. Yet, in this gloomy reſerve, they ſeem to pride themſelves, and think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves leſs happy, if obliged to be more ſocial. One may aſſert, without wronging them, that they do not ſtudy the method of going through life with pleaſure and tranquility, like the French. Might not this be a proof that they are not ſo much philoſophers as they imagine? Philoſophy is no more than the art of making ourſelves happy; that is, of ſeeking pleaſure in regularity, and reconciling what we owe to ſociety with what is due to ourſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0201400800:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>This chearfulneſs, which is the characteriſtic of our nation in the eye of an Engliſhman, paſſes almoſt for folly. But is their gloomineſs a greater mark of their wiſdom? and folly againſt folly is not the moſt chearful ſort the beſt. If our gaiety makes them ſad, they ought not to find it ſtrange, if their ſeriouſneſs makes us laugh.</p>
               <p>As this diſpoſition to levity is not familiar to them, and as they look on every thing as a fault which they do not find at home, the Engliſh, who live among us, are hurt by it. Several of their authors reproach us with it as a vice, or at leaſt as a ridicule.</p>
               <p>Mr. Addiſon ſtiles us a comic nation. In my opinion it is not acting the philoſopher on this point, to regard as a fault, that quality which contributes moſt to the pleaſure of ſociety and happineſs of life. Plato, convinced that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever makes men happier, makes them better, adviſes to neglect nothing that may excite and convert to an early habit, this ſenſe of joy in children. Seneca places it in the firſt rank of good things. Certain it is, at leaſt, that gaiety may be a concomitant of all ſorts of virtue, but that there are ſome vices with which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0201400800:223"/>As to him who laughs at every things, and him who laughs at nothing, neither of them has ſound judgment. All the difference I find between them is, that the laſt is conſtantly the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. Thoſe who ſpeak againſt chearfulneſs, prove nothing elſe, but that they were born me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholic, and that in their hearts they rather envy than condemn that levity they affect to deſpiſe.</p>
               <p>The Spectator, whoſe conſtant object was the good of mankind in general, and of his own nation in particular, ſhould, according to his own principles, place chearfulneſs among the moſt deſirable qualities; and, probably, whenever he contradicts himſelf in this particular, it is only to conform to the tempers of the people whom he addreſſes. He aſſerts, that gaiety is one great obſtacle to the prudent conduct of women. But are thoſe of a melancholic temper, as the Engliſh women generally are, leſs ſubject to the foibles of love? I am acquainted with ſome doctors in this ſcience, to whoſe judgment I would more willingly refer, than to his. And, perhaps, in reality, perſons naturally of a gay temper, are too eaſily taken off by different objects, to give themſelves up to all the exceſſes of this paſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0201400800:224"/>Mr. Hobbes, a celebrated philoſopher of his nation, maintains, that laughing proceeds from our pride alone. This is only a paradox if aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted of laughing in general, and only argues that miſanthropical diſpoſition for which he was remarkable.</p>
               <p>To bring the cauſes he aſſigns, for laughing, under ſuſpicion, it is ſufficient to remark, that proud people are commonly thoſe who laugh leaſt. Gravity is the inſeparable companion of pride. To ſay that a man is vain, becauſe the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of a writer, or the buffooneries of an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lequin, excite his laughter, would be advancing a great abſurdity. We ſhould diſtinguiſh between laughter, inſpired by joy, and that which ariſes from mockery. The malicious ſneer is improperly called laughter. It muſt be owned, that pride is the parent of ſuch laughter as this; but this is in itſelf vicious; whereas, the other ſort has nothing in its principles or effects that deſerves condemnation. We find this amiable in others, and is it unhappineſs to feel a diſpoſition towards it in ourſelves?</p>
               <p>When I ſee an Engliſhman laugh, I fancy I rather ſee him hunting after joy, than having caught it; and this is more particularly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their women, whoſe tempers are inclined to melancholy. A laugh leaves no more traces
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0201400800:225"/>
on their countenance than a flaſh of lightning on the face of the heavens. The moſt laughing air is inſtantly ſucceeded by the moſt gloomy. One would be apt to think that their ſouls open with difficulty to joy, or at leaſt that joy is not pleaſed with its habitation there.</p>
               <p>In regard to fine raillery, it muſt be allowed, that it is not natural to the Engliſh, and therefore thoſe who endeavour at it make but an ill figure. Some of their authors have candidly confeſſed, that pleaſantry is quite foreign to their character; but, according to the reaſon they give, they loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by this confeſſion.

               <p>DECEIT and falſhood have ever been an over-match for truth, and followed and admired by the majority of mankind. If we enquire after the reaſon of this, we ſhall find it
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0201400800:227"/>
in our own imaginations, which are amuſed and entertained with the perpetual novelty and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety that fiction affords, but find no manner of delight in the uniform ſimplicity of homely truth, which ſtill ſues them under the ſame appearance.</p>
               <p>He, therefore, that would gain our hearts, muſt make his court to our fancy, which being ſovereign comptroller of the paſſions, lets them looſe, and enflames them more or leſs, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the force and efficacy of the firſt cauſe, which is ever the more powerful the more new it is. Thus, in mathematical demonſtrations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though they ſeem to aim at pure truth and inſtruction, and to be addreſſed to our reaſon alone, yet I think it is pretty plain, that our underſtanding is only made a drudge to gratify our invention and curioſity, and we are pleaſed not ſo much becauſe our diſcoveries are certain, as becauſe they are new.</p>
               <p>I do not deny but the world is ſtill pleaſed with things that pleaſed it many ages ago, but it ſhould at the ſame time be conſidered, that man is naturally ſo much of a logician, as to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between matters that are plain and eaſy, and others that are hard and inconceivable. What we underſtand, we overlook and deſpiſe, and what we know nothing of, we hug and delight in? Thus there are ſuch things as perpetual no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0201400800:228"/>
for we are pleaſed no longer than we are amazed, and nothing ſo much contents us as that which confounds us.</p>
               <p>This weakneſs in human nature, gave occaſion to a party of men to make ſuch gainful markets as they have done of our credulity. All objects and facts whatever, now ceaſed to be what they had been for ever before, and received what make and meaning it was found convenient to put upon them: What people eat, and drank, and ſaw, was not what they eat, and drank, and ſaw, but ſomething farther, which they were fond of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ignorant of it. In ſhort, nothing was itſelf, but ſomething beyond itſelf; and by theſe artifices and amuſements, the heads of the world were ſo turned and intoxicated, that, at laſt, there was ſcarce a ſound ſet of brains left in it.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate of giddineſs and infatuation it was no very hard taſk to perſuade the already deluded, that there was an actual ſociety and communion between human creatures and ſpiritual daemons. And when they had thus put people into the power and clutches of the devil, none but <hi>they alone</hi> could have either ſkill or ſtrength to bring the priſoners back again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0201400800:229"/>But ſo far did they carry this dreadful drollery, and ſo fond were they of it, that to maintain it and themſelves in profitable repute, they literally ſacrificed for it, and made impious victims of numberleſs old women, and other miſerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who either through ignorance could not ſay what they were bid to ſay, or, through madneſs, ſaid what they ſhould not have ſaid. Fear and ſtupidity made them incapable of defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and frenzy and infatuation made them confeſs <hi>guilty impoſſibilities,</hi> which produced cruel ſentences, and then inhuman executions.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe wretched mortals finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves either hateful or terrible to all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended by none, and, perhaps, wanting the common neceſſaries of life, came at laſt, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor themſelves as much as they were abhorred by others, and grew willing to be burnt or hanged out of a world, which was no other to them than a ſcene of perſecution and anguiſh.</p>
               <p>Others, of ſtrong imaginations and little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, were by poſitive and repeated charges againſt them, of committing miſchievous and ſupernatural facts and villainies, <hi>deluded</hi> to judge of themſelves by the judgment of their enemies, whoſe weakneſs or malice prompted them to be accuſers. And many have been condemned as witches and dealers with the devil, for no other
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0201400800:230"/>
reaſon but their knowing more than thoſe who accuſed, tried, and paſſed ſentence upon them.</p>
               <p>In theſe caſes, credulity is a much greater error than infidelity, and it is ſafer to believe nothing than too much. A man that believes little or nothing of witchcraft, will deſtroy nobody for being under the imputation of it; and ſo far he certainly acts with humanity to others, and ſafety to himſelf: But he that credits all, or too much, upon that article, is obliged, if he acts conſiſtently with his perſuaſion, to kill all thoſe whom he takes to be the killers of mankind; and ſuch are witches. It would be a jeſt and a contradiction to ſay, that he is for ſparing them who are harmleſs of that tribe, ſince the received notion of their ſuppoſed contract with the devil, implies that they are engaged by covenant and inclination to do all the miſchief they poſſibly can.</p>
               <p>I have heard many ſtories of witches, and read many accuſations againſt them, but I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any that would have induced me to have conſigned over to the halter or the flame, any of thoſe deplorable wretches, who, as they ſhare our likeneſs and nature, ought to ſhare our compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as perſons cruelly accuſed of impoſſibilities.</p>
               <p>But we love to delude ourſelves, and often fancy or forge an effect, and then ſet ourſelves as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0201400800:231"/>
gravely, as ridiculouſly, to find out the cauſe. Thus, for example, when a dream or the hyp has given us falſe terrors, or imaginary pains, we immediately conclude, that the infernal tyrant owes us a ſpite, and inflicts his wrath and ſtripes upon us, by the hands of ſome of his ſworn ſervants amongſt us. For this end an old woman is promoted to a ſeat in <hi>Satan</hi>'s privy council, and appointed his executioner in chief, within her diſtrict. So ready and civil are we to allow the devil the dominion over us, and even to provide him with butchers and hangmen of our own make and nature.</p>
               <p>I have often wondered why we did not, in chuſing our proper officers for <hi>Belzebub,</hi> lay the lot rather upon men than women, the former being more bold and robuſt, and more equal to that bloody ſervice; but, upon enquiry, I find it has been ſo ordered for two reaſons; firſt, the men having the whole direction of this affair, are wiſe enough to ſlip their own necks out of the collar; and, ſecondly, an old woman is grown by cuſtom the moſt avoided and moſt unpitied creature under the ſun, the very name carrying contempt and ſatire in it. And ſo far, indeed, we pay but an uncourtly ſort of reſpect to <hi>Satan</hi> in ſacrificing to him nothing but the dry ſticks of human nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0201400800:232"/>We have a <hi>wondering quality</hi> within us, which finds huge gratification when we ſee ſtrange ſeats done, and cannot at the ſame time ſee the doer, or the cauſe. Such actions are ſure to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſome witch or daemon; for if we come to find they are ſlily performed by artiſts of our own ſpecies, and by cauſes purely natural, our delight dies with our amazement.</p>
               <p>It is therefore one of the moſt unthankful of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the world, to go about to expoſe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken notions of witchcraft and ſpirits; it is robbing mankind of a valuable imagination, and of the privilege of being deceived. Thoſe who at any time undertook the taſk, have always met with rough treatment and ill language for their pains, and ſeldom eſcaped the imputation of athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, becauſe they would not allow the devil to be too powerful for the Almighty. For my part, I am ſo much a heretick as to believe, that God Almighty, and not the devil, governs the world.</p>
               <p>If we enquire what are the common marks and ſymptoms by which witches are diſcovered to be ſuch, we ſhall ſee how reaſonably and mercifully thoſe poor creatures were burnt and hanged, who unhappily fell under that name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0201400800:233"/>In the firſt place, the old woman muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious ugly; her eyes hollow and red, her face ſhrivelled; ſhe goes double, and her voice trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. It frequently happens, that this rueful figure frightens a child into the palpitation of the heart: Home he runs, and tells his in mamma, that goody ſuch a one looked at him, and he is very ill. The good woman cries out, her dear baby is bewitched, and ſends for the parſon and the conſtable.</p>
               <p>It is moreover neceſſary, that ſhe be very poor. It is true, her maſter <hi>Satan</hi> has mines and hidden treaſures in his gift; but no matter, ſhe is for all that very poor, and lives on alms. She goes to <hi>Siſly</hi> the cook maid for a diſh of broth, or the heel of a loaf, and <hi>Siſly</hi> denies them to her. The old woman goes away muttering, and, perhaps, in leſs than a month's time <hi>Siſly</hi> hears the voice of a cat, and ſtrains her ancles, which are certain ſigns that ſhe is bewitched.</p>
               <p>A farmer ſees his cattle die of the murrain, and the ſheep of the rot, and poor goody is forced to be the cauſe of their death, becauſe ſhe was ſeen talking to herſelf the evening before ſuch an ewe departed, and had been gathering ſticks at the ſide of the wood where ſuch a cow run mad.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0201400800:234"/>The old woman has always for her companion an old grey cat, which is a diſguiſed devil too, and confederate with goody in works of darkneſs. They frequently go journies into <hi>Egypt</hi> upon a broom-ſtaff, in half an hour's time, and now and then goody and her cat change ſhapes. The neighbours often over-hear them in deep and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn diſcourſe together, plotting ſome dreadful miſchief, you may be ſure.</p>
               <p>There is a famous way of trying witches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by king <hi>James</hi> I. The old woman is tied hand and foot, and thrown into the river, and if ſhe ſwims ſhe is guilty, and taken out and burnt; but if ſhe is innocent, ſhe ſinks, and is <hi>only</hi> drowned.</p>
               <p>The witches are ſaid to meet their maſter fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in churches and church-yards. I wonder at the boldneſs of <hi>Satan</hi> and his congregation, in revelling and playing mountebank farces on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated ground; and I have as often wondered at the overſight and ill policy of ſome people in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it poſſible.</p>
               <p>It would have been both dangerous and impious to have treated this ſubject at one certain time in this ludicrous manner. It uſed to be managed with all poſſible gravity, and even terror; and, indeed, it was made a tragedy in all its parts,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0201400800:235"/>
and thouſands were ſacrificed, or rather mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, by ſuch evidence and colours, as, God be thanked, we are at this day aſhamed of. An old woman may be <hi>miſerable now,</hi> and not be <hi>hanged</hi> for it.</p>

               <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE AUGUSTAN AGE of England.</head>
               <p>THE hiſtory of the riſe of language and learning is calculated to gratify curioſity, rather than to ſatisfy the underſtanding. An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that period only, when language and learning arrived at its higheſt perfection, is the moſt conducive to real improvement, ſince it at once raiſes emulation, and directs to the proper objects. The age of Leo X. in Italy, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be the Aguſtan age with them. The French writers ſeem agreed to give the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation to that of Lewis XIV. but the Engliſh are yet undetermined with reſpect to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Some have looked upon the writers in the times of Queen Elizabeth as the true ſtandard for future imitation; others have deſcended to the reign of James I. and others ſtill lower, to that of Charles II. Were I to be permitted to offer an opinion upon this ſubject, I ſhould readily
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0201400800:237"/>
give my vote for the reign of Queen Anne, or ſome years before that period. It was then that taſte was united to genius, and, as before, our writers charmed with their ſtrength of thinking, ſo then they pleaſed with ſtrength and grace united. In that period of Britiſh glory, though no writer attracts our attention ſingly, yet, like ſtars loſt in each others brightneſs, they have caſt ſuch a luſtre upon the age in which they lived, that their minuteſt tranſactions will be attended to by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity with a greater eagerneſs than the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant occurrences of even empires, which have been tranſacted in greater obſcurity.</p>
               <p>At that period there ſeemed to be a juſt balance between patronage and the preſs. Before it, men were little eſteemed whoſe only merit was genius; and ſince, men who can prudently be content to catch the public, are certain of living without dependance. But the writers of the period of which I am ſpeaking, were ſufficiently eſteemed by the great, and not rewarded enough by bookſellers, to ſet them above independance. Fame conſequently then was the trueſt road to happineſs; a ſedulous attention to the mechanical buſineſs of the day makes the preſent never-failing reſource.</p>
               <p>The age of Charles II. which our countrymen term the age of wit and immorality, produced
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0201400800:238"/>
ſome writers that at once ſerved to improve our language and corrupt our hearts. The King himſelf had a large ſhare of knowledge, and ſome wit, and his courtiers were generally men who had been brought up in the ſchool of affliction and experience. For this reaſon, when the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of their fortune returned, they gave too great a looſe to pleaſure, and language was by them cultivated only as a mode of elegance. Hence, it became more enervated, and was daſhed with quaintneſſes which gave the public writings of thoſe times a very illiberal air.</p>
               <p>Leſtrange, who was by no means ſo bad a a writer as ſome have repreſented him, was ſunk in party faction, and having generally the worſt ſide of the argument, often had recourſe to ſcold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pertneſs, and, conſequently, a vulgarity that diſcovers itſelf even in his more liberal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. Her was the firſt writer who regularly enliſted himſelf under the banners of a party for pay, and fought for it through right and wrong for upwards of forty literary campaigns. This intrepidity gained him the eſteem of Cromwell himſelf, and the papers he wrote even juſt before the revolution, almoſt with the rope about his neck, have his uſual characters of impudence and perſeverance. That he was a ſtandard-writer cannot be diſowned, becauſe a great many very eminent authors formed their ſtile by his. But his
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0201400800:239"/>
ſtandard was far from being a juſt one; though, when party conſiderations are ſet aſide, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was poſſeſſed of elegance, eaſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity.</p>
               <p>Dryden, though a great and indiſputed genius, had the ſame caſt as Leſtrange. Even his plays diſcover him to be a party-man, and the ſame principle inſects his ſtile in ſubjects of the lighteſt nature; but the Engliſh tongue, as it ſtands at preſent, is greatly his debtor. He firſt gave it regular harmony, and diſcovered its latent powers. It was his pen that formed the Congreves, the Priors, and the Addiſons, who ſucceeded him; and had it not been for Dryden, we never ſhould have known a Pope, at leaſt in the meridian luſtre he now diſplays. But Dryden's excellencies, as a writer, were not confined to poetry alone. There is in his proſe writings an eaſe and elegance that have never yet been ſo well united in works of taſte or criticiſm.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh language owes very little to Otway, though, next to Shakeſpeare, the greateſt genius England ever produced in tragedy. His excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies lay in painting directly from nature, in catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every emotion juſt as it riſes from the ſoul, and in all the powers of the moving and pathetic. He appears to have had no learning, no critical knowledge, and to have lived in great diſtreſs.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0201400800:240"/>
When he died, (which he did in an obſcure houſe near the Minories) he had about him the copy of a tragedy, which it ſeems he had ſold for a trifle to Bentley the bookſeller. I have ſeen an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement at the end of one of Leſtrange's political papers, offering a reward to any one who ſhould bring it to his ſhop. What an invaluable treaſure was there irretrievably loſt, by the ignorance and neglect of the age he lived in.</p>
               <p>Lee had a great command of language, and vaſt force of expreſſion, both which the beſt of our ſucceeding dramatic poets thought proper to take for their models. Rowe, in particular, ſeems to have caught that manner, though, in all other reſpects, inferior. The other poets of that reign contributed but little towards improving the Engliſh tongue, and it is not certain whether they did not injure rather than improve it. Immorality has its cant as well as party, and many ſhocking expreſſions now crept into the language, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the tranſient faſhion of the day. The upper galleries, by the prevalence of party-ſpirit, were courted with great aſſiduity, and a horſe-laugh following ribaldry, was the higheſt inſtance of applauſe, the chaſtity as well as energy of diction being overlooked, or neglected.</p>
               <p>Virtuous ſentiment was recovered, but energy of ſtile never was. This, though diſregarded in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0201400800:241"/>
plays and party-writings, ſtill prevailed amongſt men of character and buſineſs. The diſpatches of Sir Richard Fanſhaw, Sir Wilham Godolphin, Lord Arlington, and many other miniſters of ſtate, are all of them, with reſpect to diction, manly, bold and nervous. Sir William Temple, though a man of no learning, had great knowlege and experience. He wrote always like a man of ſenſe and a gentleman, and his ſtile is the model by which the beſt proſe writers in the reign of Queen Anne, formed theirs. The beauties of Mr. Locke's ſtile, though not ſo much celebrated, are as ſtriking as that of his underſtanding. He never ſays more nor leſs than he ought, and never makes uſe of a word that he could have changed for a better. The ſame obſervation holds good of Dr. Samuel Clarke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Locke was a philoſopher, his antagoniſt Stillingfleet, Biſhop of Worceſter, was a man of learning, and therefore the conteſt between them was unequal. The clearneſs of Mr. Locke's head renders his language perſpicuous, the learning of Stillingfleet's clouds his. This is an inſtance of the ſuperiority of good ſenſe over learning, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the improvement of every language.</p>
               <p>There is nothing peculiar to the language of Archbiſhop Tillotſon, but his manner of writing is inimitable; for one who reads him, wonders
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0201400800:242"/>
why he himſelf did not think and ſpeak in that very manner. The turn of his periods is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, tho' artleſs, and every thing he ſays ſeems to flow ſpontaneouſly from inward conviction. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, tho' greatly his ſuperior in learning, falls ſhort of him in other reſpects.</p>
               <p>The time ſeems to be at hand, when juſtice will be done to Mr. Cowley's proſe, as well as poetical writings; and tho' his friend Doctor Sprat, Biſhop of Rocheſter, in his diction, falls far ſhort of the abilities for which he has been celebrated; yet, there is ſometimes an happy flow in his periods, ſomething that looks like eloquence. The ſtile of his ſucceſſor Atterbury, has been much commended by his friends, which always happens when a man diſtinguiſhes himſelf in party, but there is in it nothing extraordinary. Even the ſpeech which he made for himſelf at the bar of the houſe of Lords, before he was ſent into exile, is void of eloquence, tho' it has been cry'd up by his friends to ſuch a degree, that his enemies have ſuffered it to paſs uncenſured.</p>
               <p>The philoſophical manner of Lord Shafteſbury's writing, is nearer to that of Cicero, than any Engliſh author has yet arrived at, but, perhaps, had Cicero wrote in Engliſh, his compoſition would have greatly exceeded that of our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The diction of the latter is beautiful, but
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0201400800:243"/>
ſuch beauty, as upon nearer inſpection, carries with it evident ſymptoms of affectation. This has been attended with very diſagreeable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. Nothing is ſo eaſy to copy as affectation, and his Lordſhip's rank and fame have procured him more imitators in Britain than any other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I know; all faithfully preſerving his blemiſhes, but, unhappily, not one of his beauties.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trenchard and Dr. Davenant were political writers of great abilities in diction, and their pamphlets are now ſtandards in that way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. They were followed by Dean Swift, who, tho' in other reſpects far their ſuperior, never could ariſe to that manlineſs and clearneſs of dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in political writing, for which they were ſo juſtly famous.</p>
               <p>They were all of them exceeded by the late Lord Bolingbroke, whoſe ſtrength lay in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; for as a philoſopher and a critic he was ill qualified, being deſtitute of virtue for the one, and of learning for the other. His writings againſt Sir Robert Walpole, are incomparably the beſt part of his works. The perſonal and perpetual antipathy he had for that family, to whoſe places he thought his own abilities had a right, gave a glow to his ſtile, and an edge to his manner, that never has been yet equalled in political writing. His misfortunes and diſappointments gave his mind a turn, which his friends miſtook for philoſophy,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0201400800:244"/>
and at one time of his life he had the art to impoſe the ſame belief upon ſome of his enemies. His His idea of a patriot King, which I reckon (as indeed it was) amongſt his writings againſt Sir Robert Walpole, is a maſter-piece of diction. Even in his other works his ſtile is excellent; but where a man either does not, or will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſubject he writes on, there muſt always be a deficiency. In politics, he was generally maſter of what he undertook, in morals never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Addiſon, for a happy and natural ſtile, will be always an honour to Britiſh literature. His diction indeed wants ſtrength, but it is equal to all the ſubjects he undertakes to handle, as he never (at leaſt in his finiſhed works) attempts any thing either in the argumentative or demonſtrative way.</p>
               <p>Tho' Sir Richard Steele's reputation as a public writer, was owing to his connections with Mr. Addiſon, yet, after their intimacy was formed, Steele ſunk in his merit as an author. This was not owing ſo much to the evident ſuperiority on the part of Addiſon, as to the unnatural efforts which Steele made to equal or eclipſe him. This emulation deſtroyed that genuine flow of diction which is diſcoverable in all his former compoſitions.</p>
               <p>Whilſt their writings engaged attention, and the favour of the public, reiterated but unſucceſsful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0201400800:245"/>
were made towards forming a grammar of the Engliſh language. The authors of thoſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts went upon wrong principles. Inſtead of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to retrench the abſurdities of our language, and bringing it to a certain criterion, their gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars were no other than a collection of rules at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to naturalize thoſe abſurdities, and bring them under a regular ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>Somewhat effectual, however, might have been done towards fixing the ſtandard of the Engliſh language, had it not been for the ſpirit of party. For both <hi>whigs</hi> and <hi>tories</hi> being ambitious to ſtand at the head of ſo great a deſign, the Queen's death happened before any plan of an academy could be reſolved on.</p>
               <p>Mean while, the neceſſity of ſuch an inſtitution became every day more apparent. The periodical and political writers which then ſwarmed, adopted the very worſt manner of Leſtrange, till not only all decency, but all propriety of language, was loſt in the nation. Leſly, a pert writer, with ſome wit and learning, inſulted the government every week with the groſſeſt abuſe. His ſtile and manner, both of which were illiberal, was imitated by Ridpath, De Foe, Dunton, and others of the oppoſite party, and Toland pleaded the cauſe of atheiſm and immorality in much the ſame ſtrain; his ſubject ſeemed to debaſe his diction, and he
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0201400800:246"/>
ever failed moſt in one, when he grew moſt licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in the other.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of Queen Anne's reign, ſome of the greateſt men in England, devoted their time to party, and then a much better manner obtained in political writing. Mr. Walpole, Mr. Addiſon, Mr. Mainwaring, Mr. Steele, and many members of both houſes of parliament, drew their pens for the whigs; but they ſeem to have been over-matched, tho' not in argument, yet in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by Bolingbroke, Prior, Swift, Arbuthnot, and the other friends of the oppoſite party. They who oppoſe a miniſtry, have always a better field for ridicule and reproof, than they who defend it.</p>
               <p>Since that period, our writers have either been encouraged above their merits or below them. Some, who were poſſeſſed of the meaneſt abilities, acquired the higheſt preferments, while others, who ſeemed born to reflect a luſtre upon their age, periſhed by want and neglect. More, Savage, and Amherſt, were poſſeſſed of great abilities, yet they were ſuffered to feel all the miſeries that uſually attend the ingenious and the imprudent, that attend men of ſtrong paſſions, and no phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic reſerve in their command.</p>
               <p>At preſent, were a man to attempt to improve his fortune, or encreaſe his friendſhip by poetry,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0201400800:247"/>
he would ſoon feel the anxiety of diſappointment. The preſs lies open, and is a benefactor to every fort of literature, but that alone.</p>
               <p>I am at a loſs whether to aſcribe this falling off of the public to a vicous taſte in the poet, or in them. Perhaps, both are to be reprehended. The poet either drily didactive, gives us rules, which might appear abſtruſe even in a ſyſtem of ethics, or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flingly volatile writes upon the moſt unworthy ſubjects. Content, if he can give muſic inſtead of ſenſe; content, if he can paint to the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without any deſires or endeavours to affect; the public, therefore, with juſtice diſcard ſuch empty ſound, which has nothing but jingle, or what is worſe, the unmuſical flow of blank verſe, to recommend it. The late method alſo that our news papers have fallen into, of giving an epitome of every new publication, muſt greatly damp the writer's genius. He finds himſelf in this caſe at the mercy of men, who have neither abilities nor learning to diſtinguiſh his merit. He finds his own compoſitions mixed with the ſordid traſh of every daily ſcribbler. There is a ſufficient ſpecimen gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of his work to abate curioſity, and yet ſo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated as to render him contemptible. His firſt, and, perhaps, his ſecond work, by this means ſink, among the crudities of the age, into oblivion. Fame, he finds, begin to turn her back; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Yet there are ſtill among us men of the greateſt abilities, and who, in ſome parts of learning, have ſurpaſſed their predeceſſors: Juſtice and friendſhip might here impel me to ſpeak of names which will ſhine out to all poſterity, but prudence reſtrains me from what I ſhould otherwiſe eagerly embrace. Envy might riſe againſt every honoured name I ſhould mention, ſince ſcarce one of them has not thoſe who are his enemies, or thoſe who deſpiſe him, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>OF THE OPERA in ENGLAND.</head>
               <p>THE riſe and fall of our amuſements pretty much reſembles that of empire. They this day flouriſh without any viſible cauſe for ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; the next they decay away, without any reaſon that can be aſſigned for their downfall. Some years ago the Italian opera was the only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable amuſement among our nobility. The managers of the playhouſes dreaded it as a mortal enemy, and our very poets liſted themſelves in the oppoſition; at preſent, the houſe ſeems deſerted, the caſtratiſing to empty benches, even Prince Vologeſe himſelf, a youth of great expectations, ſings himſelf out of breath, and rattles his chain to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>To ſay the truth, the opera, as it is conducted among us, is but a very humdrum amuſement; in other countries, the decorations are entirely mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, the ſingers all excellent, and the burlettas or interludes, quite entertaining; the beſt poets compoſe the words, and the beſt maſters the muſic, but with us it is otherwiſe; the decorations are but trifling, and cheap; the ſingers, Matei only excepted, but indifferent. Inſtead of interlude, we have thoſe ſorts of ſkipping dances, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the galleries of the theatre. Every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0201400800:250"/>
ſings his favourite ſong, and the muſic is only a medly of old Italian airs, or ſome meagre modern Capricio.</p>
               <p>When ſuch is the caſe, it is not much to be wondered, if the opera is pretty much neglected; the lower orders of people have neither taſte nor fortune to reliſh ſuch an entertainment; they would find more ſatisfaction in the <hi>Roaſt Beef of Old England,</hi> than in the fineſt cloſes of an eunuch, they ſleep amidſt all the agony of recitative: On the other hand, people of fortune or taſte, can hardly be pleaſed where there is a viſible poverty in the decorations, and an entire want of taſte in the compoſition.</p>
               <p>Would it not ſurprize one, that when Metaſtaſio is ſo well known in England, and ſo univerſally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, the manager or the compoſer ſhould have recourſe to any other operas than thoſe written by him. I might venture to ſay, that <hi>written by Metaſtaſio,</hi> put up in the bills of the day, would alone be ſufficient to fill an houſe, ſince thus, the admirers of ſenſe as well as ſound, might find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
               <p>The performers alſo ſhould be entreated to ſing only their parts, without clapping in any of their own favourite airs. I muſt own, that ſuch ſongs are generally to me the moſt diſagreeable in the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0201400800:251"/>
world. Every ſinger generally chuſes a favourite air, not from the excellency of the muſic, but from the difficulty; ſuch ſongs are generally choſen as ſurprize rather than pleaſe, where the performer may ſhew his compaſs, his breath, and his volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
               <p>From hence proceed thoſe unnatural ſtartings, thoſe unmuſical cloſings, and ſhakes lengthened out to a painful continuance; ſuch, indeed, may ſhew a voice, but it muſt give a truly delicate ear the utmoſt uneaſineſs. Such tricks are not muſic; neither Corelli nor Pergoleſi ever permitted them, and they begin even to be diſcontinued in Italy, where they firſt had their riſe.</p>
               <p>And now I am upon the ſubject: Our compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers alſo ſhould affect greater ſimplicity, let their baſe cliff have all the variety they can give it; let the body of the muſic (if I may ſo expreſs it) be as various as they pleaſe, but let them avoid orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting a barren ground work; let them not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, by flouriſhing, to cheat us of ſolid harmony.</p>
               <p>The works of Mr. Rameau are never heard without a ſurprizing effect. I can attribute it only to this ſimplicity he every where obſerves, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that ſome of his fineſt harmonies are often only octave and uniſon. This ſimple manner has greater powers than is generally imagined; and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0201400800:252"/>
were not ſuch a demonſtration miſplaced, I think, from the principles of muſic, it might be proved to be moſt agreeable.</p>
               <p>But to leave general reflection. With the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſet of performers, the operas, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor thinks proper, may be carried on with ſome ſucceſs, ſince they have all ſome merit; if not as actors, at leaſt as ſingers. Signora Matei is at once both a perfect actreſs and a very fine ſinger. She is poſſeſſed of a fine ſenſibility in her manner, and ſeldom indulges thoſe extravagant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſical flights of voice complained of before. Cornacini, on the other hand, is a very indifferent actor; has a moſt unmeaning face; ſeems not to feel his part; is infected with a paſſion of ſhewing his compaſs; but to recompence all theſe defects, his voice is melodious; he has vaſt compaſs and great volubility; his ſwell and ſhake are perfectly fine, unleſs that he continues the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tter too long. In ſhort, whatever the defects of his action may be, they are amply recompenced by his excellency as a ſinger; nor can I avoid fancying that he might make a much greater figure in an oratorio, than upon the ſtage.</p>
               <p>However, upon the whole, I know not whether ever operas can be kept up in England; they ſeem to be entirely exotic, and require the niceſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and care. Inſtead of this, the care of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0201400800:253"/>
them is aſſigned to men unacquainted with the genius and diſpoſition of the people they would amuſe, and whoſe only motives are immediate gain. Whether a diſcontinuance of ſuch entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would be more to the loſs or the advantage of the nation, I will not take upon me to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſince it is as much our intereſt to induce foreigners of taſte among us on the one hand, as it is to diſcourage thoſe trifling members of ſociety, who generally compoſe the operatical <hi>dramatis perſonae</hi> on the other.</p>
