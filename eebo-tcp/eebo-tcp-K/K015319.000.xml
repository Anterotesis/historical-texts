            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE TRUE METHOD OF REDUCING RUPTURES, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Truſs is only intended for the benefit of ſuch Ruptures in the Groin and Scrotum as there is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of returning again into the Abdomen; tho' I make others of a different conſtruction, according to the ſituation of the part from whence it proceeds, and other circumſtances that may attend it; and in particular a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Elaſtic Bandage for a Rupture in the Navel; for the invention of which I am in part obliged to Dr. ALLEN, of <hi>Dalwich College.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEFORE I give any directions how to apply my Truſs, it may be proper to ſay ſomething
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0650001100:5"/>with regard to the ſafeſt and eaſieſt manner of reducing the Inteſtine, when fallen down; and the following is the method I have always practiſed with great ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>I MUST too premiſe, that I have ſome hopes my Readers will not entertain a leſs favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opinion of me, if I avoid the pompoſity of ſome perſons who have wrote on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; if I do not endeavour to raiſe my merit on the ſound of a word, and torture language for new-fangled and varying names, merely becauſe the ſymptoms of the diſorder are triflingly different.</p>
            <p>IF the Rupture then be much enlarged, or painful, it will be of great ſervice to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, before the reduction is attempted, to take a gentle cooling purgative, ſuch as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Tamarinds with Sena, or a ſolution of Salts and Manna; and if he is of a plethoric or full habit of body, to let a moderate quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of blood will be proper; and at the ſame time the parts ſhould be fomented with a piece of flannel wrung out of a warm decoction of emollient herbs, ſuch as Chamomile Flowers, Mallows, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0650001100:6"/>
            <p>AFTER theſe preparations, you ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the following manner: Lay the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient upon his back in ſuch a poſture that his Buttocks may be conſiderably higher than his Head, as by that means the Bowels that are within the Belly will fall more towards the Breaſt, and not only give way to what is to be returned, but be of ſome aſſiſtance to the reduction. Then you muſt examine care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as to the ſituation of the Teſticles; and if you find they are forced up towards the ſides of the Scrotum by the ſize of the Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you muſt be very cautious not to ſqueeze them in your attempt. If you find them compreſſed at the bottom of the Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, you muſt with the fore-finger and thumb of one hand ſeparate them from the ruptured part, and with the ſame fingers of the other hand take hold of the upper part that is next the Ring of the Muſcles, or place from whence the Rupture comes out, and work it gently in, in the ſame manner as you obſerve Women do with a cow's teats when they milk her. By obſerving this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod you will never be apt to ſtrain the Rings of the Muſcles, nor hurt the Inteſtine, ſo as to occaſion an inflammation of any of theſe parts.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0650001100:7"/>
            <p>As to the application of the Truſs, it will be more convenient to put it ſlack round the Patient's Body before he is laid down, as by his getting up after the reduction there might be ſome riſque of the Bowel falling down again. Take hold of each end of the ſpring, and open it wide enough to receive his Body ſide-ways; and after you have got the Bowel fairly reduced, apply the Cuſhion of the Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs upon the Rings or Orifice from whence the Bowel came out. It muſt have a gentle hold of the upper part of the Os Pubis or Sharebone; but take care it is not placed too high or too low: The Spring will be a direction, which ſhould come round the Os Ilium, and cloſe to the juncture of the Thigh-bones, and touch the Rump juſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here the clift of the Buttocks begins; which parts are called by the Anatomiſts, the Great Trochanter of the Thigh-bones, and the middle of the Os Sacrum. The Truſs muſt be made ſo tight as to make it ſit cloſe, otherwiſe it will neither do its office, nor be eaſy to the wearer.</p>
            <p>ALWAYS keep under the Cuſhion four fold of old coarſe linnen, which will keep the part cool and eaſy, and prevent the Cuſhion from being ſpoiled by the moiſture of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0650001100:8"/>Skin. It will be a great addition to the Truſs, if for ſix or ſeven weeks, or longer (that is to ſay, till the Patient has compleated his cure, which, if he has youth on his ſide, may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be in two months; of which, indeed, I have ſeen ſome inſtances, but then the Patient has been very obſervant of the rules preſcribed him) the parts are bathed with very cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter every night and morning, which may be done conveniently in the following manner: Take a piece of large linen cloth, fold it up pretty thick ſo as to be about ſix or ſeven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſquare, a few ſtitches may be put into it to keep the folds together; dip it into a baſon of cold water, (but, that you may not wet the Truſs, looſe it, and lay the Pad or Cuſhion that was in the Groin up to the Navel out of the way of the water) then ſqueeze and apply it to the Scrotum and Groin, and as it loſes its cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dip it in the water again and again, which ſhould be continued for half an hour at a time: It is moſt convenient this cold bathing ſhould be performed when the Patient is naked in bed. It is neceſſary that the Patient's breeches ſhould be very long in the Thighs, ſo as to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the waiſtband to come high up on the Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices above the Truſs, for if it bear thereon it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0650001100:9"/>will add ſo much to the preſſure, which will make it very uneaſy.</p>
            <p>I MUST here adviſe my Reader, that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining any thing like a Rupture, he does not miſtake a Swelling of the Spermatic Chord, or in the Groin, for one; as by handling any thing of that kind roughly, he may not only give the Patient an exquiſite deal of pain, but do great miſchief. If it is really a Rupture, gentle means, without being in too great a hurry, will anſwer beſt. A very gentle preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Fingers in an erect poſture will ſometimes cauſe it to diſappear: But if this ſhold fail, lay your Patient on his Back; then rub your Fingers upwards and downwards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely from the Os Ilium to the Os Pubis. This is to be continued for a conſiderable time; but if it ſhould not remove it, and it ſtill continues to the touch as at firſt, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt continue in the ſame ſituation, and have the part fomented, and the above opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again performed: After which, ſhould it ſtill continue hard, it is certainly no Rupture<note n="*" place="bottom">When a Surgeon meaſures a Patient for a Truſs, he is to take it round very cloſe to the juncture of the Thigh-bone to the Os Ilium, which is the proper place for the Truſs to be wore; then ſending the number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that the meaſure contains to the Truſs-maker, he never can make an error; but he muſt, too, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on which ſide the Rupture is; whether it is double, or whether it is only in the Groin, or in both Groins, ſo as to deſcend as low on one ſide as the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note>.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0650001100:10"/>
            <p>I HAVE been frequently ſhocked at the cruelty with which I have ſeen Surgeons uſe their Patients, merely by miſtaking a Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for a Rupture.—On theſe occaſions I have remonſtrated;—but as I was not bred a Surgeon, my counſel was treated with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, altho' they quickly found their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts in that way were in vain.</p>
            <p>IT may not here be improper to obſerve, that my knowledge in theſe matters took its firſt riſe from being afflicted with a Rupture myſelf. I tried all the different kinds of Truſſes that have been uſed and recommended by Surgeons for many years back, but found the beſt of them ſubject to ſome inconveniency. However, as I was originally a Mechanic, I went to work with an intention to avoid the inconveniencies of thoſe I had uſed; and after trying ſeveral different new forms, I at laſt hit upon that which I now offer to the Public, and has given ſo much ſatisfaction to all who have uſed it. As to any farther knowledge
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0650001100:11"/>I have of Ruptures, I am obliged to ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Faculty, particularly Dr. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Dr. Livingſton; alſo to Dr. Barry, for the books he recommended to my peruſal. When put you in mind how ridiculous the Surgeons of former times appear in this more enlightened age, in having rejected <hi>Frere Jaques</hi>'s new method of Cutting for the Stone, for no other reaſon but becauſe he was not a regular bred Surgeon, I hope no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Faculty will condemn my Truſs, till he can prove its having any deficiency, and has compared it very narrowly with others that continue in uſe. The recommendation of thoſe who have experienced its benefit (which ſome thouſands in the dominions of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Holland, and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, have done) would perhaps be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but that many people who are ſubject to any diſorder of that kind are fond of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing it, and conſequently will never mention any thing of my Truſs. However, in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtituted Truſs-Maker to his Majeſty's Royal Hoſpital at Greenwich; even when Mr. Alexander Reid, firſt Surgeon's Mate of Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea Hoſpital; Mr. William Blackey, of the College of Surgeons at Paris; and Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon, <hi>Bedſtead-Maker,</hi> of Hanover-Street,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0650001100:12"/>Long-Acre, with a letter of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſigned by a great number of <hi>regular-bred</hi> Surgeons, (amongſt whom I wiſh Mr. Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins had not been one) ſome of them too the moſt eminent in the profeſſion in Truſſes in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; were candidates in oppoſition to me, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to give the Public a juſt idea ofits merit. Theſe gentlemen, it is well known, did ſtand a fair trial with me every day, almoſt for two months, before the Phyſicians and Surgeons of the Royal Hoſpital made their report of the candidates different merits; on which I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Elaſtic Truſs-maker by the Honorable Board of Directors of his Majeſty's Royal Hoſpital.</p>
            <p>I THINK it would be here an unpardonable offence to poſterity, not to inform my Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that to this day a Surgeon of the greateſt eminence recommends a <hi>Shoemaker.</hi> to all his Ruptured Patients to make the Truſſes for them, though I am very certain he does not know iron from ſteel, when it is made out of the common ſizes of the bars thereof. This I have from jobbing-ſmiths, ſome of whom the ſeller has employed ever ſince he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from a <hi>Shoemaker</hi> into a Truſs-maker. It is this <hi>eminent Surgeon</hi> and this <hi>Shoemaker</hi> that Counſellor Brand, at May's Hill, Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0650001100:13"/>means in his letter therefrom to me, which is hereafter inſerted for the uſe of the public, amongſt others ſent me, together with Certificates of the Efficacy of my Truſſes above all others made uſe of.</p>
            <p>SHORTLY after I had invented my Elaſtic Truſs, I had an opportunity of ſending ſome of them to Mr. Ranby, Principal Serjeant-Surgeon to his Majeſty; in conſequence of which I received the following letter.</p>

                  <p>I HUMBLY beg leave to repreſent to you, that Ruptures are unfortunately too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: Perhaps the fourth part of mankind labour under them in old age; and as to women who have had children, if half of them eſcape accidents of this kind, it is a miracle.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0650001100:17"/>
                  <p>BEING originally<note n="*" place="bottom">When I ſay <hi>originally,</hi> I would be underſtood that it was the firſt trade I followed: and I am not, I ought not to be aſhamed of ſaying, though I practiſed it ſome years with great ſuceſs, I was not regularly bred even to <hi>that,</hi> nor any other trade whatever.</note> a Cutler and Surgeon's Inſtrument-maker, and having been for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years afflicted with a Rupture which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incommoded me in the neceſſary functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life, I had recourſe to the various Truſſes and Bandages made uſe of for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that misfortune, both from London and Paris; but finding them very incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious as well as ineffectual, I applied myſelf with great attention to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe neceſſary contrivances; and, after many years repeated trials and many years experience have at laſt happily ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo greatly improved the Steel Truſs, as to make it anſwer every deſireable purpoſe for the curing as well as palliating that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome diſorder; which numbers as well as myſelf have experienced, both here and in London; to authenticate which aſſertion, letters, ſhould it be thought neceſſary, can be produced from Patients reſident at both places.</p>

                  <p>THE great advantages which my Truſſes have, in conſequence of this Improvement, above others, are as follow:</p>
                  <p>FIRST, by an Elaſtic Spring, peculiar to themſelves, they are accommodated equally well to perſons of every Age and Size; ſo that two different Sizes is the only requiſite for making them fit every perſon of above two years of age; and the ſame circumſtance likewiſe makes them more proper for exportation than any hitherto invented.</p>
                  <p>SECONDLY, They do not require that troubleſome and incommodious appendage a Thigh-ſtrap, ſo commonly uſed in other Bandages.</p>
                  <p>THIRDLY, They by the Elaſticity above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned maintain a conſtant, equal, and uniform preſſure on the part only affected, and imitate the kind preſſure of the Hand in all its degrees, in all the different atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the Body; whereby the parts mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rupture are ſo conſtantly kept from coming down, that an opportunity is given to the relaxed and ruptured parts through
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0650001100:19"/>which they deſcend to recover their former ſtate, and thereby prove to the Patient a radical Cure.</p>
                  <p>FOUR THLY, I can afford to ſell the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Truſſes at as low a price as the other Truſs-makers in Britain ſell their Iron Truſſes, without any other property to them than dignifying them with the names of Steel and Spring Truſſes.</p>
                  <p>THESE, and other advantages, too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to mention, convince me that this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, when generally known, will prove a very great benefit to a very great part of mankind: And therefore I perſuade myſelf that ſhould it meet with your appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, I ſhall not fail of ſharing that encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and generoſity which ſo highly dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies your honourable Society.</p>

                  <p>YOU here have the report Dr. Monro gives the Society of Arts, on the back of your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, which I returned this day to Mr. Barclay, who ſaid it would make nothing as to premium. After his reſpectful compliments to the honourable Society, Dr. Monro ſays, "The Truſſes Mr. Brand preſents is no new invention, as there is of the ſame kind and ſame materials uſed by moſt Surgeons in Europe for many years paſt: The only eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential circumſtance is, the circular Steel Spring is more ſtrict than thoſe in common uſe, which makes them ſit eaſier on the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and better fit perſons of different ſizes." He adds, "that this laſt is ſcarce worth obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as each perſon ought to have his

               <q>"P. S. A few days after I delivered your memorial to Mr. Barclay he called at my houſe, and told me the Society had pitched on Dr. Monro to examine into the merits of your Truſſes; which the Doctor very readily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, and that I muſt carry them to him directly; which I accordingly did. On opening the box, taking them out, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Doctor, he ſaid they were made in the ſame manner as Mr. Auchinlec here makes them. I ſaid there was a <hi>great</hi> difference. But ſtill the Doctor inſiſted there was <hi>none.</hi> On this, his ſon ſtept into another room, and brought one of Auchinlec's mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and on comparing them together, he confeſſed there <hi>was</hi> a difference.—Had he ſuffered as much pain with Truſſes as I have done, he would ſooner have ſeen it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN perſons of confined ideas, and who have not the advantages of education, fall into
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0650001100:22"/>an error, there is an excuſe ready for them: The groſs miſtakes of a man of letters are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable. Dr. Monro's miſapprehenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeems WILFUL. Could any thing be more uncandid than his declaration that my Truſſes and Mr. Auchinlec's were alike?—Could any thing be more mean than the hard-ſtrain'd acknowledgement, that <q>"there was <hi>ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference?"</hi>
               </q> In his report he ſays, <q>"that my Truſs differs from others, only in the circular Steel Spring being more ſtrict than thoſe in common uſe; which makes them ſit <hi>eaſier,</hi> and better fit perſons of <hi>different ſizes;"</hi>
               </q> but this <hi>eaſe</hi> and this <hi>convenience,</hi> it ſeems, are not worth thinking of, becauſe <q>"each perſon ought to have his meaſure taken in the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate manner."</q>—Here is philoſophy! —I frequently ſend Truſſes to the Eaſt and Weſt Indies—Were Dr. Monro living, I would aſk him, if I ſhould make a voyage every time I receive an order.—</p>
            <p>HERE follow ſeveral teſtimonies to the merits of my Truſs, which, without further ceremony, the Reader will, I believe, accept.</p>

            <p>MR. Spencer was a gentleman of the clergy, and had a living in North America.

            <p>HAVING received ſeveral letters containing the moſt illiberal abuſe, in conſequence of the publication of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pages, ſome of which I have reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe were written by Counſellor Brand's<note n="*" place="bottom">See Page 20.</note> 
               <hi>Surgeon of Character;</hi> I think it neceſſary to declare, that I never intended, nor, indeed, could I form an idea, that the Treatiſe in queſtion ſhould give the ſmalleſt offence to any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Faculty. My ſole object was—the relief of my fellow-creatures, and the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ignorant in that which it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary they ſhould know.—Beſides improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their practice, I have a right to the thanks of the Faculty, for pointing out the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious cure of a Malady, from which <hi>they</hi> are by no means exempt—and which the moſt eminent of them have had no little trouble to remove.—And I ſincerely wiſh I could not ſay with truth, that numbers have, within theſe few years, loſt their lives, after having paid very conſiderable ſums for pretended aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ineffectual advice. It is intereſt,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0650001100:33"/>then, alone that prevents theſe cavillers from doing juſtice to my performances, and which prompts them to cheat the diſordered of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
            <p>I AM acquainted with Surgeons who have been many years in practice, and who have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me they never had an opportunity of reducing a Rupture, or of applying a Truſs.—A midwife, too, who has been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of twenty years in practice, lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to me, that, to her knowledge, ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had delivered a woman that had a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either in the Groin or Navel.—Yet have I applied Bandages on a variety of both.—</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the <hi>true method</hi> of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Truſſes, or <hi>reducing Ruptures,</hi> is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the utmoſt importance in the treatment of that malady, and in the higheſt degree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the eaſe of the Patient, I am bold to ſay, that in all the treatiſes I have peruſed, both antient and modern (and they are not a few), I never met with any thing like a clear inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that purpoſe.—Something <hi>curious,</hi> tho' by no means advantageous, may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from a book lately publiſhed.—(The Author, I think, dignifies his name with,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0650001100:34"/>
               <q>"Maſter of Arts and Surgery, Member of the Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris, Demonſtrator in the School of St. Come, Surgeon for Ruptures of the Hoſpitals of Hotel Dieu, the Invalids and Incurables, of the City of Paris, and of all the military Hoſpitals in France.")</q> A proceſs is there adviſed for making an ointment of a ſolution of Gold Pearls, to be uſed for aſſiſting the reduction of ſtrangulated Ruptures.—When this ingenious and moſt expenſive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is compleated, it will probably be as efficacious as the ſame quantity of clay, in the ſame manner applied.</p>
            <p>I HOPED in the treatiſes above hinted at, to have found ſomething that would, at leaſt, have been capable of improvement in the true method of applying Truſſes, and the reducing Ruptures:—On the contrary, they contain merely long and unſatisfactory details of the manner in which the antient Surgeons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly burnt the Ruptures of their Patients, and deſtroyed the fleſh of thoſe parts to the Bone, with a view of avoiding the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary application of Truſſes.—This is one proof, among many, that Surgeons never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged Truſſes, altho' it is univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0650001100:35"/>that it is impoſſible a cure can be perfectly obtained without ſuch an aſſiſtant.—The pain attending the wearing of ſome Truſſes, it muſt be acknowledged, has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented many perſons from adhering to the moſt ſalutary method of cure; but ſuch neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect is often attended with the moſt dreadful conſequences; it being no uncommon thing to meet perſons in the ſtreet, whoſe Guts partly falling into their breeches, exhibit a deplorable and pitiable ſpectacle.</p>
            <p>AND here it may not be improper to inform the Reader of the encouragement I received from the Faculty on my arrival in London, which was in June, 1764. Mr. Ranby being the only gentleman of the profeſſion I had the honour of knowing, I waited upon him; and, by his deſire, afterwards attended the Gentlemen of St. George's Hoſpital. With the countenance of ſuch a Gentleman as Mr. Ranby, whoſe name and letter to me at Aberdeen I had the liberty to uſe, I could not but form the moſt pleaſing hopes of convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſome of the firſt Surgeons in England of the merit and utility of my Truſſes.—But I was diſappointed: I found, tho' they were men of learning, they were not men of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0650001100:36"/>—Mr. Bromfield ſaid, <q>"he believed they <hi>might do."</hi>
               </q> Mr. Gataker ſaid, <q>"he could ſee nothing more in <hi>my</hi> Truſſes than in <hi>any</hi>
                  <hi> other."</hi>
               </q> However, while I was one day at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a perſon, then under the care of Mr. Hawkins, he informed me that he had long been an Out-patient of that Hoſpital, and had Truſſes from every Truſs-maker in Town, but that none of them would keep his Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture up; and that ſince he had been under Mr. Hawkins's care, he had procured him a Truſs from a perſon in Bartholomew Cloſe, which would by no means keep up his Rupture, tho' he had been to the maker twenty times to have it altered, who told him his Rupture would never be well 'till he had it cut. I looked upon this as an opportunity, offered me by Providence, of at once doing a ſervice to a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creature, and bringing conviction of the uſe of my Elaſtic Truſſes to thoſe who had ignorantly or intereſtedly denied their merits. I brought the youth to my lodgings, and there applied a Truſs on him; my honeſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours had the deſired effect; and in about three months, he obtained a compleat cure.</p>
            <p>LEST any of my Readers ſhould doubt the truth of this relation, I deſire to inform
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0650001100:37"/>them that the name of the above-mentioned youth is John Pellerſt, whoſe uncle, of the ſame name, lives in Downe-ſtreet, near Hyde-Park Corner; and I believe that ſomething relative to this affair will be found in the books of St. George's Hoſpital, from the beginning of April 1764, to the end of Auguſt in the ſame year.—To this caſe I have only to add, that notwithſtanding this ample proof of the merits of my Truſs, I cannot charge Mr. Hawkins with recommending a ſingle Patient to me, tho' he has often confeſſed my Truſſes were more efficacious than thoſe of any other perſon he had knowledge of.</p>
            <p>IN Mr. Pott's Treatiſe on Ruptures, ſecond Edition, Sec. 1. Page 29, that gentleman ſays, <q>"The cure of a Rupture is either perfect (called alſo radical) or imperfect, which is called palliative. This diſtinction, which, he ſays, is juſt and true, and founded both on reaſon and experience, has frequently been miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the generality of mankind, and has therefore been the cauſe of much undeſerving cenſure on the practitioners of Surgery."</q> He adds, <q>"the truth is, that tho' the events are extremely different, yet the chirurgical means which are made uſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0650001100:38"/>of in either caſe are exactly the ſame, viz. the reduction of the protruded parts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of them when ſo reduced by proper Bandages."</q>—I wiſh Mr. Pott had given the addreſs of his <hi>proper Bandage-maker,</hi> as Dr. Smellie did of his proper Midwifery In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument-maker. I could never find thoſe Bandages at the <hi>Shoemaker</hi>'s, nor at the RUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE-CURER'S, who has his name diſtinguiſhed in the Court and City Regiſter for 1771.—Convinced at leaſt of their politeneſs in thus dignifying a man who has little pretenſion to public favour, I had no doubt but that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers, or compilers directors had compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented me with a ſimilar appellation;—but I was again miſtaken: I found (in Page 142) <hi>my</hi> deſert would procure me barely the title of plain <hi>Truſs-maker.</hi>—I wiſh ſome of thoſe perſons whom this RUPTURE-CURER has aſſiſted, would perſuade me out of a notion that it is death which generally performs the cure for this worthy gentleman. I am aſſured that thoſe Truſſes ſaid to be of his making are too painful even for a horſe to wear. He prides himſelf, I am told, on employing the ſame perſons who did buſineſs for my Predeceſſor.—As a proof of the abſurdity of building on another's ſuppoſed reputation, when I was appointed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0650001100:39"/>Truſs-maker to Greenwich Hoſpital, I could not find one in twenty of the ruptured men in that place, who could wear the Truſſes made by my predoceſſor; and thoſe who did wear them were ſo miſerably fretted and galled on their Hips and Loins, that they were obliged to attend the Surgeon every morning to have their Wounds dreſſed: So that by my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, I had the pleaſure not only of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the diſeaſed men from the miſery they ſuffered by the iron Truſſes before made uſe of, but prevented the ſurgeons from being troubled with the like complaints, and ſaved the expences of the houſe.</p>
            <p>BEING, about twenty-eight years ſince, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with a Rupture, I conſented to become a Patient to Meſſrs. Woodward and Hunt; and from a ſtrict attention to their method, I am enabled to give the Reader ſome idea of it. The firſt object then with them was, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Patient—with reſpect to his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. If he would part freely with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they firſt applied a linen Bandage; and ſhortly after informed him, that was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of itſelf to perform the cure, and that they muſt call in the aſſiſtance of proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0650001100:40"/>with which they would furniſh him at one Guinea per Month.—And in this way did they cajole me out of Fourteen Guineas; and my Rupture was greatly worſe at the year's end than when firſt I became their Patient.</p>
            <p>I AM here induced to relate a Story which cannot be contradicted, and which will ſerve ſufficiently to expoſe the fallacy of trifling and vain pretenders. A gentleman of 70 years of age, who has been afflicted many years with a Rupture, and who has worn a Truſs of my making for upwards of theſe five years, which rendered his Rupture, tho' by no means cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of little trouble to him, was very lately perſuaded to apply to Mr. L. a Surgeon, for a complete cure. He accordingly waited on that gentleman, to know if he would take his caſe in hand, and what the expence would be. Mr. L. told him he had no doubt of effecting a cure, even if he was eighty years old; and as he was only a Tradeſman, he believed he could do it for about 30 Guineas; but that the Patient muſt wait on him every morning. This, the gentleman informed him, was a thing he could not do; and the Surgeon, therefore, conſented to call upon him.—Next
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0650001100:41"/>morning Mr. L. dreſſed in a ſuit of black vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, drove in his chariot to his Patient's. The tradſeman, reflecting that this appearance of grandeur was not kept up at a ſmall expence, determined to make a ſure bargain, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly told the Surgeon,—<q>"Sir, before we proceed to buſineſs, let me know exactly what the expence of this cure will be; and if no cure—no pay."</q>—At this the Surgeon "ſtarted like a <hi>guilty thing,"</hi> and turning on his heel, whipp'd into his chariot, and drove home,—no doubt ſufficiently mortified at the diſappointment.—I have only to remark, that if every afflicted perſon would endeavour to make as certain a bargain as my Patient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do with the above-mentioned im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent aſſertor, the velvet ſuits of ſuch pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifoggers in genius would ſoon be ruſty, and their Chariots without a wheel.</p>
            <p>I AM acquainted with many perſons of both ſexes who have been Patients to Mr. L. and they all agree that the following is his method of operation: Firſt, he applies a Bandage, as Woodward and Hunt uſed to do. The Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent muſt then attend on him once a day for ſo many times as he ſhall appoint, and at theſe times he applies a bruſh dipt in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0650001100:42"/>which he calls an Aſtringent. When he is tired of bruſhing, he pronounces a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete cure; which ſhould the Patient preſume to doubt, he is capable of behaving in the moſt inſolent manner, which he juſtifies by the affront offered to his knowledge:—and ſhould their ſpirit on the occaſion equal his impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (which is barely poſſible), he will even go ſo far as to threaten a proſecution for defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. To corroborate this fact, it is well known that, about ſeven years ago, this ſame Mr. L. obtained a verdict of eighty pounds from a Surgeon of eminence, and another of an hundred pounds from a Gentleman in the ſame profeſſion equally reſpectable, for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended defamation; and has ſince been at the point of being pilloried for his mal-practices on his Ruptured Patients.</p>
            <p>I MUST here beg leave to introduce a paſſage from Mr. Pott's Treatiſe on Ruptures, p. 169. <q>"The hiſtories of Prior, Cabriere, Bowles, Sir Thomas Renton, Dr. Littlejohn, &amp;c. &amp;c. to be found in Dionis, Houſton, and other writers, will furniſh to the Reader an idea of the practice and performances of ſome who have ſtood at the head of thoſe bold promiſers."</q>—<q>"This is a ſubject in which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0650001100:43"/> mankind are much intereſted, and on which a good deal might be ſaid; but as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt endeavour to ſave the afflicted from the hands of thoſe who have no character to loſe, and whoſe only point is money, might from one of the profeſſion be miſconſtrued into malevolence and craft, I will not enter into it; but ſhall conclude by wiſhing, that they who have capacity to judge of theſe matters (which are as much the object of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe as any other kind of knowledge) would not ſuffer themſelves to be deluded by the impudent aſſertions of any Charlatan whatever; but determine in this, as they do in many other things, that is, by the event."</q>—There is a ſentence in ſacred writ which naturally ſtrikes me on the preſent occaſion—<q>"Out of <hi>thy own</hi> mouth will I <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> thee."</q>—Let the Reader join the above quotations, and think for himſelf.—I ſnall only ſay, that I ſincerely wiſh Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor Brand's <hi>Surgeon of character</hi> would reflect on the very <hi>excellent</hi> opinion of Mr. Pott, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he receives his fee merely for approving what the <hi>Shoemaker</hi> has done, or preparing the way for what he is to do.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0650001100:44"/>
            <p>WITH reſpect to myſelf, without a vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to a thorough knowledge of Surgery, it is my boaſt that a ſtudious application, long experience, and, above all, a ſtrict adherence to the principles of<note n="*" place="bottom">My Readers, I hope, will not accuſe me of oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when I remark, that from the 7th of November, 1770, to the 31ſt of January, 1771, I have given away Truſſes to perſons who were incapable of purchaſing them, to the amount of 23l. 2s.—Atteſtations of the truth of which from the Overſeers, &amp;c. of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent pariſhes to which they belong, are ready to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to thoſe who ſhall deſire to ſee them: A greater ſum, I believe, than is diſpenſed to the poor afflicted with Ruptures from all the Hoſpitals, except Greenwich and Chelſea, in the ſame period of time.</note> Humanity, have fixed me in the midſt of a moſt extenſive practice. That there are perſons who bear me illw-ill, I have no doubt; but I have the conſolation, that, in this caſe, thoſe who are <hi>my</hi> enemies are the enemies of Society.—I deſpiſe the reflections thrown out againſt me on account of my former profeſſions: Such reflections are at once a proof of ill manners and ill principles. The good and the ſenſible will acknowledge, that it is as poſſible for a ſoldier to attain a knowledge of the true method of reducing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0650001100:45"/>Ruptures and applying Truſſes, as it was for Frere Jacques to diſcover the proper manner of cutting for the ſtone; for a friar to inſtruct the world in the uſe of Gun-powder; or a ſoldier to invent the important and uſeful art of Printing. From a conviction that the Pupils in the different Hoſpitals in town ſeldom had an opportunity of ſeeing a Rupture, and from a deſire to render a knowledge of its proper treatment more general; I very lately gave them a public invitation to ſee me perform the operation of reducing Ruptures, and the retention of them when ſo reduced by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truſſes, which is the only remedy, at all ages, and in all ſtates, of reducible Ruptures. At the ſame time, I provided a number of caſes, ſome of which were acknowledged by Mr. Hunter to be the moſt ſingular he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered to have met with.—However, this good diſpoſition in me could not eſcape cenſure;—an undiſtinguiſhing haughtineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued it an affront—and I was informed, that if I perſiſted in that practice, it would greatly offend the Faculty. To exculpate myſelf from a deſign to give offence, I ſhall only refer to the feelings of every candid Reader, and ſay,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0650001100:46"/>that I meant a ſervice to the world. In conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I ſhall ſubjoin a few Caſes, and for the preſent take my leave,—wiſhing thoſe who condemn from ignorance, more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;—thoſe who aſperſe from malevolence, more good-nature.</p>

            <p>ON the 20th of January, one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſioners of Greenwich Hoſpital ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to me, in the Surgery of that place, for a Truſs for a double Rupture. Upon examining him, I ſound the Rupture ſingle only, and in the right Groin; in the left Groin the Teſticle lying in an oval figure, acroſs the orifice, where a Rupture generally deſcends, and no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Scrotum on the left ſide of the Penis. This moſt extraordinary ſituation was occaſioned, he informed me, by a fall acroſs the gunnel of a boat about twelve months ago. When the Truſs was properly applied, the Bandage did not in the ſmalleſt degree com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Teſticle oppoſite to the Rupture; and I have the ſatisfaction to ſay, that there is now the greateſt probability of a palliative cure being effected. Thoſe who doubt the authenticity of this relation are intreated to refer to the cheque book, which is kept in the Surgery of the above-mentioned Hoſpital.</p>
            <p>ON the 7th of November laſt, a poor man, recommended by Mr. Benjamin Morris, Overſeer of the Poor of St. Luke, Middleſex,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0650001100:48"/>came to me for aſſiſtance. He ſaid, that about ten Months before that time, he felt ſomething in his Groin which was not then attended with any pain: However, it by degrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and increaſing grew very painful, and much larger; and that very often it made him ſo ſick, that it would occaſion him to throw up what he had eaten, and was often incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of working for his bread;—for that when he was in an upright poſture his Rupture would ſometimes fall down with that violence as to burſt open the codpiece of his breeches. I applied a Truſs; and the laſt time I ſaw him, which was the 14th of January laſt, he informed me, that ever ſince I applied the Truſs to his Rupture, it had not fallen down once, nor had he loſt a day's work. Any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſhall doubt this, may be ſatisfied of the truth of the caſe by applying to Mr. Morris above-mentioned, or at my houſe, where they will be ſhewn a letter of thanks from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient himſelf, whoſe deſire it is the ſame may be publicly ſeen.</p>
            <p>THOMAS Weſt, a young man about twenty, applied to me on the 24th of December laſt, for relief in the caſe of a Rupture, which he
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0650001100:49"/>had had ever ſince he was fourteen years of age. It was, at the time mentioned, increaſed to the ſize of eight inches circumference from the Teſticle above the Os Pubis. I reduced it all, and applied a Truſs thereon, at the ſame time informing him in what manner he ſhould proceed to obtain a perfect cure. In about ten days he came to me again, ſaid he had been very punctual in the obſervation of my directions, and that he was completely cured, notwithſtanding he had uſed all manner of common exerciſes. He then pulled off his Truſs, coughed and blowed his noſe in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner, and ſaid there was no occaſion for wearing the Truſs any longer. I aſked him if wearing it gave him any pain; he replied no; and I ordered him not to leave it off for a few months.—This extraordinary caſe will be authenticated by applying to Mr. Weſt, Lighterman, in King-Street, Deptford, who is the Patient's Brother.</p>
            <p>ABOUT two years and a half ago, a lad of twelve years of age was brought to me by Mr. Macguire, Peruke-maker, of Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane, for the cure of a Rupture. When I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined him, I found the Rupture, which was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0650001100:50"/>in the right Groin, prodigiouſly large, with the Teſticle at the lower extremity of it: The left Teſticle was confined in the abdomen, and had been ſo ever ſince he could remember. By the proper application of my Elaſtic Truſs, he obtained a radical cure in about nine months; the right Teſticle at that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in its proper and natural ſtate in the Scrotum. I then told him he might lay the Truſs aſide. In a few months after, Mr. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guire brought the boy to me again; ſaid his Rupture was extremely bad, and that he muſt have another Truſs.—On examining him, ſo far from having a Rupture, his right Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle had followed the Rupture into the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and, with the left, remains in that ſtate to this day; and what is ſtill more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there is not the ſmalleſt appearance of the Scrotum, altho' the Penis remains in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate.</p>
