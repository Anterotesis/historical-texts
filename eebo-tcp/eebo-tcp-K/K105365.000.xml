            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>(Rare Gifts!) yet, WALPOLE, wilt thou condeſcend</l>
               <l>To liſten, if thy unexperienc'd Friend</l>
               <l>Can ought of Uſe impart, tho' void of Skill,</l>
               <l>And win Attention by ſincere good Will;</l>

               <l>As when the rapid <hi>Rhone,</hi> o'er ſwelling Tides,</l>

               <l>Tho' rich his Source, he drains a thouſand Springs,</l>
               <l>Nor ſcorns the Tribute each ſmall Riv'let brings.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So thou ſhalt hence abſorb each feeble Ray,</l>

               <l>Shalt like; or where thou can'ſt not like, excuſe,</l>
               <l>Since no mean Intereſt ſhall prophane the Muſe:</l>
               <l>No Malice wrapp'd in Truth's Diſguiſe, offend,</l>
               <l>Nor Flattery taint the Freedom of the Friend.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When firſt a generous Mind ſurveys the Great,</l>
               <l>And views the Crowds that on their Fortune wait;</l>
               <l>Pleas'd with the Show (tho' little underſtood)</l>
               <l>He only ſeeks the Power, to do the Good;</l>
               <l>Thinks, 'till he tries, 'tis Godlike to diſpoſe,</l>
               <l>And Gratitude ſtill ſprings, where Bounty flows;</l>
               <l>That every Grant ſincere Affection wins,</l>
               <l>And where our Wants have End, our Love begins:</l>
               <l>But thoſe who long the Paths of State have trod,</l>
               <l>Learn from the Clamours of the murmuring Crowd;</l>

Which cramm'd, yet craving ſtill, their Gates beſiege,</l>

               <l>This of Thy Conduct ſeems the niceſt Part,</l>
               <l>The chief Perfection of the Stateſman's Art,</l>
               <l>To give to fair Aſſent a fairer Face,</l>

               <l>But few there are that can be truly kind,</l>
               <l>Or know to fix their Favours on the Mind:</l>
               <l>Hence ſome, whene'er they would oblige, offend;</l>
               <l>And while they make the Fortune, loſe the Friend:</l>
               <l>Still give unthank'd, ſtill ſquander, not beſtow;</l>
               <l>For great Men want not, what to give, but how.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Race of Men that follow Courts, 'tis true,</l>
               <l>Think all they get, and more than all their Due:</l>
               <l>Still ask, but ne'er conſult their own Deſerts;</l>
               <l>And meaſure by their Intereſt, not their Parts.</l>
               <l>From this Miſtake, ſo many Men we ſee,</l>

               <l>More Power, more Favour in the Great Man's Eyes:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1001101200:5"/>
All feel a Want, tho' none the Cauſe ſuſpects,</l>
               <l>And hate their Patron, for their own Defects;</l>
               <l>Such none can pleaſe, but who reforms their Hearts,</l>
               <l>And, when he gives them Places, gives them Parts.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As theſe o'erprize their Worth, ſo ſure the Great</l>
               <l>May ſell their Favour at too dear a Rate;</l>
               <l>When Merit pines, while Clamour is preferr'd,</l>
               <l>And long Attachment waits among the Herd;</l>
               <l>When no Diſtinction, where Diſtinction's due,</l>
               <l>Marks from the many, the Superior few;</l>
               <l>When ſtrong Cabal conſtrains them to be juſt,</l>
               <l>And makes them give at laſt—becauſe they muſt</l>
               <l>What Hopes that Men of real Worth ſhould prize,</l>
               <l>What neither Friendſhip gives, nor Merit buys!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Man who juſtly o'er the Whole preſides,</l>
               <l>His well weigh'd Choice, with wiſe Affections, guides;</l>
               <l>Knows when to ſtop with Grace, and when advance,</l>
               <l>Nor gives from Importunity, or Chance;</l>
               <l>But thinks how little Gratitude is ow'd,</l>
               <l>When Favours are extorted, not beſtow'd.</l>

            <lg>

               <l>When ſafe on Shore ourſelves, we ſee the Crowd</l>
               <l>Surround the Great, importunate and loud;</l>
               <l>Thro' ſuch a Tumult, 'tis no eaſy Task</l>
               <l>To drive the Man of real Worth to ask:</l>
               <l>Surrounded thus, and giddy with the Show,</l>
               <l>'Tis hard for great Men, rightly to beſtow;</l>
               <l>From hence ſo few are skill'd, in either Caſe,</l>
               <l>To ask with Dignity, or give with Grace.</l>
               <l>Sometimes the Great, ſeduc'd by Love of Parts,</l>
               <l>Conſult our Genius, but neglect our Hearts;</l>
               <l>Pleas'd with the glitt'ring Sparks, that Genius flings,</l>
               <l>They lift us cow'ring on their Eagles Wings,</l>
               <l>Mark out the Flights, by which themſelves begun,</l>
               <l>And teach our dazzled Eyes to bear the Sun;</l>
               <l>Till we forget the Hand that made us great,</l>
               <l>And grow to envy, not to emulate.</l>
               <l>To emulate, a general Warmth implies,</l>
               <l>To reach the Virtues, that make great Men riſe;</l>
               <l>But Envy wears a mean malignant Face,</l>
               <l>And aims not at their Virtues, but their Place.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Such to oblige, how vain is the Pretence?</l>
               <l>When every Favour is a freſh Offence,</l>

By which ſuperior Power is ſtill imply'd,</l>
               <l>And, while it helps their Fortune, hurts their Pride.</l>
               <l>Slight is the Hate, Neglect or Hardſhips breed;</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The Man, who contradicts the publick Voice,</l>
