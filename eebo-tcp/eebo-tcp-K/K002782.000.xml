            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <hi>THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION,</hi> Or, The Progreſs of the Aliment, from the Mouth to the Heart and Lungs, with the Changes it undergoes in its Paſſage, until it is converted into Blood; ſhewing by what Law of the Animal Economy the <hi>BODY IS MAINTAINED AND SUPPORTED IN A NATURAL HEALTHY STATE.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>After the maſticated food is conveyed into the ſtomach, it is there reduced into a ſoft pulpy maſs; the ſtomach then more ſtrongly contracts and forces out at every ſuch contraction, a portion of its contents, until the whole is evacuated into the firſt bowel, called by Anatomiſts <hi>Duodenum:</hi> hence ariſes the true ſenſation of hunger: But, if the ſtomach through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is unable either properly to digeſt the aliment or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with ſufficient force ſo as to evacuate its contents in due time, an unnatural fermentation with an increaſed ſecretion take place, which produce the ſymptoms of Indigeſtion; ſuch as, flatulency, diſtention, eructations, acidity; great uneaſineſs, fickneſs, vomiting, pain, and ſpaſm or cramp of the ſtomach; loſs of appetite, fluſhing heats, pain and giddineſs of the head, with ſometimes a palpitation of the heart, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>When the food thus partially diſſolved, gets into the firſt bowel, it there meets with the bile or gall, and the pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atic juice, intended to anſwer ſome unknown purpoſe in the act of digeſtion. Theſe fluids being intimately combined with this alimentary pulp, which they further attenuate and diſſolve, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0492600200:5"/>into which they ſeem to infuſe new properties) is puſhed forward through the bowels by their frequent contractions; and the more fluid part (called <hi>chyle</hi>), being ſeparated in this progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is abſorbed and conveyed to the blood by the <hi>lacteals;</hi> while the more ſolid part, thus deprived of every nutritious particle, is evacuated from the body as uſeleſs. But when the bowel are become weak, through the ſtomach remaining ſo for a length of time, this muſt be the caſe, they will be unable to contract ſufficiently, as either perfectly to ſeparate the fluid from the ſolid part, or to evacuate their contents in due time. Hence ariſe crude chyle, a coſtive habit, piles, fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulent colic, head ach; and collections of ſlimy matter in the bowels, from which many diſeaſes are derived, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally worms.</p>
                  <p>The liquid part of the digeſted aliment, being ſeparated from the ſolid part by the natural contractile power of the bowels, becomes a mild ſweet, and whitiſh fluid, termed <hi>chyle,</hi> which the lacteals abſorb and convey to the meſenteric glands, and afterwards to the thoracic duct, from which it is poured into the left ſubclavian vein, and by that into the heart and lungs. Here the chyle is mixed with the blood, which changes and aſſimilates that fluid into its own nature. This is called <hi>Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> It is from this fluid that the blood is made; and this affords that ſupply of nutrition which the continual waſte of the body is found to require. I ſhall now point out</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>THE OFFICES OF THE BLOOD.</head>
                  <p>The Blood ſupplies every waſte of the body made by the different ſecretions; the ſecretid fluids, therefore, certainly are all formed from the blood, ſuch as the perſpiration, urine, ſaliva, bile, &amp;c. It forms every part of the body, both ſolids and fluids: it repairs diſeaſed parts: it forms that hard ſubſtance or cement in fractures, which unites the ends of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0492600200:6"/>broken bones ſo firmly together: In ſhort, it regenerates all the ſolid parts of the animal ſyſtem, and repleniſhes all the waſte of the fluids. Such being the important offices of the blood, it is univerſally allowed to be and it moſt certainly is the principle or <hi>pabulum</hi> of life. But, unleſs the blood is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly recruited by a freſh ſupply of good chyle, (from which as before obſerved, it is made) an impoveriſhed and vitiated ſtate of that vital fluid muſt enſue; conſequently theſe offices, ſo eſſential to health, cannot be duly performed; nor that waſte, occaſioned by the different ſecretions, be properly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Hence ariſe general debility, nervous diſorders, gout, dropſy, jaundice, and cutaneous eruptions.</p>
                  <p>Though it is evident that the chyle ſupplies the blood with its nutrition, and that, iſ the former is vitiated, the latter muſt ſooner or later become ſo too; yet it is neceſſary to remark, that, beſides the chyle, the blood in its paſſage through the lungs, receives from the external air, during the act of inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, another principle which is called OXYGEN AIR. This is the ſource of animal heat, as well as the cauſe of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, irritability, and motion:—It is this which empowers the blood to ſtimulate the heart and arteries into action:—It is this which gives the blood its florid c lour: in ſhort, this imparts to it the vital principle.</p>
                  <p>In order to render the laſt paragraph more perſpicuous, I ſhall ſpecify the component parts of the atmoſphere; this is a body conſiſting of two ſpecies of airs, namely OXYGEN and AZOT, which bear a certain proportion to each other; that is, about twenty-eight parts of Oxygenated, vital, or dephlogiſticated air, which ſupports life and flame; and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two parts of Azotic (commonly called, phlogiſticated) air, which deſtroys both. This atmoſpheric air, being inſpired by the lungs, meets there with the blood paſſing through them, to which the oxygenated or vital air having a greater affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity than to the azotic or phlogiſticated air, diſengages itſelf
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0492600200:7"/>from the azot and combines with the blood, which at the ſame time parts with another ſpecies of air that has a greater affinity to the azot than it has to the blood: Theſe two extricated fluids, (to wit, that eſcaping from the blood, and the azotic air,) combining together, are expelled from the lungs in the form of vapour termed <hi>breath.</hi> This conſtant action of the lungs conſtitutes what is called <hi>Reſpiration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whenever the oxygen or dephlogiſticated air becomes much diminiſhed, according to the proportion which it ought to bear to the other component part of the atmoſphere in order to anſwer the purpoſes of life—or, in other words, where the atmoſphere is lowered or contaminated—the blood loſes its natural ſtimulus: Hence ariſes a diminiſhed action of the heart and arteries; the conſequences of which are, fainting, languor, head ach, difficulty of breathing, general relaxation; and, if it continues long in that ſtate, cutaneous eruptions, and eſpecially the ſea ſcurvy.</p>
                  <p>The neceſſity of obtaining the air in as pure a ſtate as the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere will admit, muſt appear obvious from what has been ſaid reſpecting its wonderful effects: this is quite as requiſite to be attended to, as preſerving the ſtrength of the digeſtive organs: for, while the chyle, which is prepared by them from the food, is ſupplying the waſte occaſioned by the different offices of the blood, the oxygen (received by the lungs from the atmoſphere) at the ſame time is ſupporting its heat and action, without which life cannot ſubſiſt.</p>
                  <p>The following circumſtances produce a diminution of oxygen in the air:—Firſt, A great number of people being aſſembled together in any place, in which the air has not a free circulation, or where its equilibrium is not reſtored so quickly as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by reſpiration:—Secondly, Large fires in rooms, from whence the external air is in a great meaſure excluded; for the fire, in order to ſupport itſelf, attracts the oxygen and conſumes it, whereby the vital property of the air is decreaſed; and, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0492600200:8"/>larger the ſire, the greater quantity of air muſt neceſſarily be conſumed; hence the impropriety of great fires in ſmall rooms or bedchambers:—Thirdly, Burning many candles renders the air foul, from the before-mentioned cauſe, becauſe the flame deſtroys the purity of the air. It has been aſcertained that each perſon deſtroys the vivifying principle of a gallon of air in one minute, alſo that a ſingle candle conſumes a ſimilar quantity in the ſame ſpace of time: which ſhews that oxygen or pure air equally ſupport animal life and flame; for, where a candle will not burn, owing to the want of a ſupply or it, an animal cannot live. Theſe three circumſtances are therefore ſuch as deſtroy the purity of the air, and render that element unfit for the purpoſes of life; ſo that in a very ſhort time, and even in a ſpacious apartment, any of them muſt prove deſtructive to the vital principle of a large column of air: hence where theſe unavoidably take place, ventilators abſolutely become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.</p>
                  <p>It may be neceſſary here to obſerve, that water and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables have a contrary effect; for they attract and abſorb the impure air and conſequently increaſe the vital property thereof: hence the air in the country and that on the ſea coaſt is more ſalubrious than that of cities and large towns.</p>

                     <head>THE TONIC POWDERS AND DROPS.</head>
                     <p>It may, therefore, be neceſſary that ſome remarks ſhould be made on the admirable properties of theſe valuable medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, more eſpecially with regard to</p>
                     <div type="effects">
                        <head>THEIR GENERAL EFFECTS:</head>
                        <p>The TONIC POWDERS evacuate bile, phlegm, and water, which are the greateſt impediments to health; hence they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come highly uſeful whenever there is a redundancy of bile or phlegm, or any dropfical ſwelling, eſpecially in the feet or legs.—They promote the natural action of the ſtomach and howels—They obviate coſtiveneſs, and prevent thoſe complaints depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant thereon; hence they are of the utmoſt ſervice in coſtive habits.—They render the body cool and comfortable; hence they are of the greateſt benefit, where there are feveriſh, hectic, or fluſhing heats.</p>
                        <p>Many families of the highest reſpectability are ready to teſtify, that both they and their children have enjoyed much better health in every reſpect, ever ſince they were recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to take the Tonic Powders; and alſo that the expenſe of medicines has been very trifling ſince they made uſe of theſe in compariſon to what it had been before that period:—By having recourſe to them occaſionally when coſtive, and when any uneaſineſs or pain of the ſtomach and bowels, or feveriſh heat, &amp;c. take place, the conſtitution will be preſerved from a variety of complaints that otherwiſe would happen. What adds much to the value of theſe Powders is—that no age, ſex, or conſtitution, nor any circumſtance whatever, can render them objectionable.</p>
                        <p>While the Powders evacuate the indigeſtible matter, the TONIC DROPS ſtrengthen the ſtomach and bowels, and thereby prevent a return of the complaints—They likewiſe ſtrengthen the general and nervous ſyſtem, hence their great utility in nervous diſeaſes and debility of every kind, however induced.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0492600200:10"/>—They create an appetite, and alſo expel wind—They have frequently removed the Gout in the ſtomach, after many other medicines had been given without effect.</p>
                        <p>When theſe POWDERS AND DROPS are properly taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they promote the ſecretions, and effectually cure all the complaints of the ſtomach and bowels, which no ſingle medicine could accompliſh alone; becauſe the DROPS are regularly and uninterruptedly taken in the complaint, and the POWDERS only conditionally during their uſe; ſo that they jointly remove the diſorder, and reſtore to the habit its priſtine healthy ſtate.</p>

               <p>The Diet in Indigeſtion ſhould be particularly attended to, which will not only facilitate its cure, but will alſo be the means of preventing complaints in general.</p>
               <p>The beſt food for BREAKFAST during this diſorder, provided is agrees with the patient's ſtomach, is</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>MILK,</head>
                  <p>Which is eaſy of digeſtion, and affords a greater ſupply of nouriſhment to the body when the digeſtive organs are weak, and with much more certainty, than any other kind of food. In caſes of emaciation and general debility, alſo when the powers of nature or the vigor of the conſtitution begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, milk is a moſt excellent reſtorative diet: it gives to the fluids both quantity and quality in the moſt perfect manner. This valuable fluid, however, certainly does not agree with every conſtitution; for the gaſtric juice renders it more or leſs coagulated in every ſtomach, and ſo firmly in ſome as even to reſiſt the ſolvent power of that organ; conſequently a variety of complaints muſt enſue: It has never been aſcertained from what particular cauſe this unnatural coagulation happens, neither has the prevention of it been yet diſcovered; therefore, the beſt way is to avoid Milk entirely, where it is found to diſagree: for with ſome (eſpecially children) it produces fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulency,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0492600200:11"/>diſtention, and pain in the ſtomach and bowels, great difficulty of breathing, fever, &amp;c. When theſe caſes have occurred without any evident cauſe, I have ordered the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt of milk to be changed to common tea with only a little milk in it, or water gruel; in conſequence of which, the children have become more healthy in every reſpect, and have required much leſs medicine than before.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>TEA.</head>
                  <p>The quality and effects of common Tea have employed many ingenious pens, and moſt agree that it has ſome peculiar effects on the nervous ſyſtem, producing tremors, &amp;c. but, for my own part, I believe, that in nine hundred and ninety nine caſes out of a thouſand, it agrees very well, eſpecially the black ſort. After ſtudy or fatigue, Tea is a moſt grateful repaſt; as it quenches thirſt and cheers the ſpirits, without heating the body. Whatever bad effects have been apparently produced by the uſe of this valuable plant, they have evidently ariſen from drinking it too ſtrong, too hot, in too large a quantity, or in too great a hurry: whereby a temporary relaxation is induced over the whole ſyſtem, and conſequently faintneſs and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling may enſue. However when neither milk nor common tea are perfectly agreeable to the patient,</p>

               <div type="part">

It is neceſſary to caution the patient againſt the too liberal uſe of hot watery fluids, as that would increaſe the debility of the ſtomach already ſubſiſting.</p>

                  <head>COFFEE</head>

                  <p>For abating the fits of a periodical aſthma, ſtrong coffee is recommended by Sir JOHN PRINGLE, which he affirms to be the beſt remedy he was ever acquainted with; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he directs an ounce of the beſt Mocha coffee to be made into a ſingle diſh; and this is to be repeated, after the interval of a quarter or half an hour, but it muſt be drank without milk or ſugar: Sir JOHN FLOYER, who wrote a very ingenious Treatiſe on the Aſthma, was long afflicted with that diſorder; but, during the latter years of his life, he was kept free from (or, at leaſt, lived more eaſy under) that complaint, by the uſe of very ſtrong coffee.</p>

                  <head>ANIMAL FOOD.</head>
                  <p>A Mixture of Animal and Vegetable Food affords the moſt wholeſome diet, and the greateſt nouriſhment: Animal food tends to induce corpulency and too great a fulneſs of the blood veſſels; vegetable food, on the contrary, is ſound too weak a diet for many conſtitutions, and therefore would be improper to live upon alone, though it would be much the ſafeſt of the two; but in regulating the exact proportion that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0492600200:13"/>Animal and Vegetable Food ſhould bear to each other, regard ſhould be had to the ſeaſon of the year, the ſtate of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the conſtitution of the body, &amp;c. for, in hot weather, infectious air, or in full habits, in perſons ſubject to feveriſh heats, and thoſe who live a ſtudious or ſedentary life, much animal food is improper; but when the weather is cold, the conſtitution ſtrong, and much exerciſe uſed, animal food ſhould preponderate.</p>
                  <p>People who are afflicted with Indigeſtion, General Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Nervous Diſeaſes, and Gouty Complaints, ſhould ever remember that the body is not nouriſhed in proportion to the quantity of food received into the ſtomach, but according to the degree of perfection with which it is digeſted; and therefore however ſimple the food may be, more ſhould never be eaten than will ſit perfectly eaſy on the ſtomach: overloading that organ diſturbs the proceſs of digeſtion, and prevents the proper returns of appetite. Nothing is of ſo much importance to invalids, and perſons of weak or debilitated conſtitutions, as a proper attention to the quantity of their food; though many people appear to be poſſeſſed of ſuch powers of digeſtion, that they never ſeem to be incommoded therewith; yet the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of mankind are affected with uneaſineſs; and how often do we hear ſuch perſons complaining of the ill effects of this or that particular kind of food, when the quantity of all, rather than the diſagreement of any, is the cauſe of their complaints. The Author of Nature has ſo formed us that it is evident we are deſigned to live on any part of the globe. Our organs of digeſtion are ſo conſtructed, that we may gradually accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date ourſelves to aliment of every quality; but this is not the caſe in regard to quantity; Nature, by degrees, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſubdue and change into nutriment almoſt every part of the a creation, but to quantity ſhe yields.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0492600200:14"/>
                  <p>MUTTON, VENISON, BEEF, VEAL, and LAMB.—Theſe are very wholeſome meats; and if roaſted, and eaten with ſuch vegetables as are found to agree with the ſtomach, the better.</p>
                  <p>Broths or Soups ſcarcely ever agree with weak ſtomachs, becauſe they relax that organ; therefore, they are digeſted flower, and with more difficulty, and are of a leſs nutritious quality, than ſolid animal food. I have frequently obſerved, that meat, even difficult of digeſtion, will ſit much eaſier upon a debilitated ſtomach, than any watery or ſpoon diet.</p>
                  <p>Fried meat, or that baked in a pie, is more difficult of ſolution than that which is moderately roaſted or boiled.</p>
                  <p>Animal food, if kept ſome time after it is killed, before it is uſed, becomes more tender and eaſier of digeſtion Meat ſomewhat rare, is more ſoluble in the ſtomach, and affords more nouriſhment than that which is perfectly or over done.</p>
                  <p>It is a common notion that the Gravy of meat is unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; on the contrary, it is very nutritive, and is always proper when animal food is neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>The fat of meat is nutritious, and more ſoluble than the lean; but, like butter and oil, it is apt to diſorder the ſtomach.</p>
                  <p>SALTED MEAT, when frequently uſed, is unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; being very difficult of digeſtion, it vitiates the blood and other circulating fluids But a moderate quantity of ſalt, taken with our food ſeems neceſſary to aſſiſt digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>High-ſeaſoned food ſhould be avoided, becauſe it excites an unnatural appetite, ſtimulates and heats the ſtomach, and eventually deſtroys its tone. Pepper and Ginger are the moſt heating Spices; therefore they ſhould be uſed with great moderation.</p>
                  <p>FISH, in general, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0492600200:15"/>every kind are the moſt nouriſhing. SALT FISH, like other ſubſtances preſerved by ſalt, is unwholeſome.</p>
                  <p>PORK AND BACON, it is remarked, generally diſorder thoſe perſons who have weak organs of digeſtion; however, ſome people find them wholeſome. Young ſucking pigs are heavier than full grown pork becauſe they are fatter.</p>
                  <p>RABBIT AND HARE are readily digeſted.</p>
                  <p>GEESE and DUCKS are heavy food, and hard of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. Turkey is much lighter than either, but rather heavier than the common Fowl and Pheaſant. Partridge, Quail, Moorgame, the Woodcock, and Pidgeons, are all eaſily digeſted, and afford much nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>Maſtication, or chewing the food properly, very much aſſiſts the ſtomach in digeſting it; therefore ſhould never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a ſlight or haſty manner.</p>

                  <head>VEGETABLE FOOD.</head>
                  <p>Taſte and Smell generally direct our choice of vegetables; and it may be aſſerted, with very few exceptions, that thoſe which are agreeable to theſe ſenſes are the moſt ſalutary, and <hi>vice verſa.</hi> But it frequently happens, that both taſte and ſmell are vitiated; therefore, when this is the caſe, thoſe vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables which ſit eaſieſt on the ſtomach are the moſt proper.</p>
                  <p>As Vegetables tend to reduce plethora and abate heat, they are very proper for corpulency, and plethoric habits,, and for thoſe who are troubled with feveriſh heats, and diſtention of the blood veſſels; and, when accompanied with ſufficient exerciſe, and ſuch medicines as preſerve the natural ſtate of the bowels, this diet will remove that inflammatory habit of body, which medicines alone could not effect. At the ſame time, it ſhould be remembered, that ſudden changes in the mode of living are generally dangerous; therefore, when an alteration becomes requiſite, it ſhould be made gradually.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0492600200:16"/>
                  <p>Vegetables ate leſs ſtimulant and leſs nouriſhing, but more cooling than animal food; they are generally conſidered as flatulent. As this quality, however, is never perceived by perſons whoſe ſtomach and bowels are in a healthy ſtate, flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency may reaſonably be imputed to debility of theſe organs, rather than to the aliment itſelf.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now conſider a few of thoſe vegetable ſubſtances, which are chiefly employed as food.</p>
                  <p>BREAD affords more nouriſhment than moſt other vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſubſtances, but it it inferior to animal food, both in this reſpect and in facility of digeſtion. It ſhould not be eaten, till twenty-four hours after it is baked.</p>
                  <p>RICE is highly nutritious, and more eaſily digeſted than bread, ſeldom occaſions acidity or flatulency, and perhaps is the moſt wholeſome grain that is uſed by man. The univerſal opinion, that Rice is of an aſtringent nature, is founded in error. It is generally preſcribed very judiciouſly as a diet in purgings, and debility of the digeſtive organs, becauſe it produces leſs diſturbance to the ſtomach and bowels in digeſting than any other aliment.</p>
                  <p>POTATOES are more eaſily digeſted than bread; but they afford leſs nouriſhment than either rice or bread, owing chiefly to the large quantity of water contained in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Potatoes, aſparagus, and artichokes, often agree with weak ſtomachs, when cabbage, carrots, and onions, &amp;c. will not.</p>
                  <p>PARSNIPS are agreeable to moſt palates, and are very nouriſhing and eaſy of digeſtion; ſome people, indeed, diſlike them on account of their ſweetneſs, but this is a proof of their nutritious quality. The poor people in ſome part of Ireland, it is ſaid, make beer from this root.</p>

                  <p>BIET ROOT contains a conſiderable quantity of ſugar, conſequently it is nouriſhing and eaſy of digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>Celery, Lettuce, endive, raddiſh, cucumber, and melon, which have not been ſubjected to the action of fire, contain the whole quantity of their fixed air, and are therefore more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult of ſolution than other vegetables.</p>
                  <p>It is a fact worthy of remark, that the boiling of vegetables thoroughly extricates a quantity of fixed air, which renders them leſs liable to produce flatulency or wind.</p>
                  <p>BUTTER, and the expreſſed Oil of Vegetables, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely nutritive; but they are difficult of digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>EGGS are nutritious, and are very light food when mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately boiled</p>
                  <p>FRUITS.—Theſe, in general, afford a mild and wholeſome nouriſhment, and a proper uſe of them greatly contributes to the preſervation of health. It is a miſtaken notion, that thoſe complaints of the ſtomach and bowels which happen in ſummer and autumn, ariſe from the quantity of Fruit taken at that time: When we conſider the nature of the ſecreted fluids, which, at thoſe ſeaſons of the year, have a putrid tendency; together with a ſimilar diſpoſition in the ſtate of the air; we muſt reaſonably conclude, from the aceſcent quality of Fruits; that a moderate uſe of them would not only tend to cure, but would in a great meaſure prevent thoſe bilious diſorders ſo uſual at the latter end of ſummer. Ripe fruit extinguiſhes thirſt, moderates heat, opens the body, and affords a moſt grateful ſenſation to the ſtomach. Dried fruits are more nutritive than the green, though leſs ſoluble in the ſtomach. Fruit of every kind is very improper after a full meal.</p>
                  <p>ACIDS, when moderately uſed, are grateful to the ſtomach, aſſiſt the appetite, and promote digeſtion: but the too liberal uſe of them often diſorders the ſtomach and bowels, and, it has been aſſerted, occaſions a return of the gout.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0492600200:20"/>
                  <p>SUGAR is the moſt nutritive thing in nature; therefore the ſaccharine part of vegetables is very juſtly thought to afford the greateſt nouriſhment. Honey and Sugar poſſeſs this ſaccharine principle in its moſt concentrated ſtate; and, where they agree, if uſed in moderation, are very whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
                  <p>NUTS are certainly nouriſhing, but difficult of digeſtion;—hence the impropriety of introducing ſuch ſubſtances in deſerts, when the ſtomach is ſufficed with other food. Nuts ſhould always be eaten in great moderation; for too large a quantity of them oppreſſes the ſtomach, excites pain, and diſturbs the proceſs of digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>A variety of food at one meal is unwholeſome, becauſe it induces the perſon to eat more than the ſtomach can digeſt with facility.</p>

                  <p>Theſe muſt be of that hind which will beſt agree with the patient's ſtomach, and produces the leaſt heat, wind, or diſtention.</p>
                  <p>MALT LIQUORS are certainly the moſt ſalutary, as well as the moſt natural to the conſtitution: They are perfectly well calculated to dilute the food and quench thirſt; and when they agree with the ſtomach, they promote digeſtion and procure ſleep.

                  <p>TABLE BEER, well brewed, and of a due ſtrength and age, in my opinion, is the beſt drink in the world for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral uſe: and it was ſtrongly recommended by the great Dr. SYDENHAM. But where it cannot be kept long without turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four, it generates flatulency or wind, and is therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper.</p>

                  <p>WINE—If malt liquors cannot be admitted, owing to their producing an unnatural fermentation in the ſtomach, and cauſing wind, White wine and water is an excellent light liquor; and, if it does not turn acid on the ſtomach, may be allowed for common drink. After dinner, a few glaſſes of wine may be taken, provided the patient has been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to a full diet. Wine moderately uſed is not only of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to thoſe who are troubled with Indigeſtion, but alſo to perſons advanced in life, or where nature is on the decline; in general relaxation, and in all low, nervous, paralytic, and dropſical caſes. Where the patient has been in the habit of living very freely, the quantity of wine ſhould be diminiſhed by degrees. Wines of good body and proper age, ſhould be choſen, ſuch as Madeira, Port, Sherry, &amp;c. the ſmall wines being more apt to turn acid in the ſtomach, and interrupt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. It may be neceſſary here to obſerve, that the quality of wine chiefly depends on the ſtate in which the grape is gathered, which is always influenced by the ſeaſon: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of one year, therefore, is frequently preferable to that of another. When the wine is made from unripe fruit, it will be productive of bad conſequences to the conſtitution; this often gives riſe to a ſuſpicion of its being ſophiſticated.</p>
                  <p>The immoderate uſe of wine is injurious to every perſon, more particularly to ſtudious men, as it increaſes thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the ſtomach and head which ſtudy may have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: thoſe who drink too freely of wine are particularly ſubject to the gout; while on the contrary, thoſe who confine themſelves to drinking malt liquors or water, are ſeldom affected with that complaint. A bottle of wine a day is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly too much for any perſon who prefers health to pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary here to obſerve, that the ſtomach ſhould be preſerved from the action of ſtrong ſtimulants, and every thing which produces an unnatural heat of the body ſhould be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: theſe precautions ſhould be minutely attended to, not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0492600200:22"/>only in caſes of Indigeſtion, but alſo in nervous diſeaſes, debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the gout, &amp;c. and even in perfect health.</p>
                  <p>SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS.—If neither Malt Liquors nor Wine agree with the ſtomach, a little Brandy, Rum, or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva, properly diluted with water, as they retard fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tend to prevent acidity, may prove a beneficial drink. But the too liberal uſe of Spirituous Liquors accuſtoms the ſtomach to an unnatural ſtimulus, which increaſes its action and deſtroys its proper tone; produces ſickneſs and retching, a depreſſion of ſpirits, loſs of memory, confuſion of ideas, and nervous tremors: in hot climates, they occaſion phrenzy—in cold ones, ſtupidity. A man may appear very ſober, and yet drink a large quantity of theſe liquors ſo as greatly to quicken the pulſe, and to excite an unnatural heat; which is hurtful to every body, particularly to a ſedentary or ſtudious man.</p>
                  <p>One of the moſt extraordinary effects produced by the immoderate uſe of Spirits, is the following caſe, communicated to the Royal Society by Mr. WILMER:—A woman, who had every day for many months, drank a great quantity of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors, was diſcovered burnt to death at Coventry, though the fire in the grate had been ſmall, and the furniture of the room had ſuffered but little; the greateſt part of her body was conſumed, and even the bones were completely calcined. —An Italian Counteſs is ſaid to have met with a ſimilar ſate in conſequence of drinking immoderately of brandy.</p>
                  <p>WATER. This is not only a proper drink when acidity and flatulency prevail, but alſo where the bile has acquired too much acrimony. Cold water ſtrengthens the ſtomach, aſſiſts digeſtion, prevents obſtructions, renders ſleep more calm, and cheerfulneſs more regular and laſting: It has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that water drinkers have their underſtandings more clear, their memory more ſteady, their ſenſes more quick, and their manners more gentle.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0492600200:23"/>
                  <p>Water is the drink Nature has given to all nations, made it agreeable to all palates, and is the only liquor to ſatisfy thirſt of all the brute creation, and ſome part of mankind during their whole lives take no other; and the ſtate of health thoſe perſons enjoy, the hard labour and fatigue they are able to undergo, ſhew that water is well ſuited as a drink to anſwer every purpoſe of the animal economy. That kind which has no impregnation ſenſible to the ſight, taſte, or ſmell, is the beſt for uſe.</p>

                  <p>Reſpecting theſe the following mode may be adopted as a good one; namely, that of allowing eight hours for labour or exerciſe, eight hours for pleaſure or amuſement, and the ſame length of time for ſleep or reſt; though ſome people require more of the latter. The patient ſhould pay great attention to natural reſt, for by the want of this, the tone of the nervous ſyſtem is greatly diminiſhed, and a weak circulation produced: hence paleneſs, languor, coldeſs, and dejection of ſpirits. No pleaſure whatever can in any meaſure compenſate for the loſs of natural hours of ſleep.</p>
                  <p>Exerciſe promotes a mutual action of both ſolids and fluids; it increaſes animal heat; it invigorates the heart, and occaſions an equal diſtribution of the blood and other circulating fluids through the whole ſyſtem; it increaſes the action of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach with reſpect to appetite and digeſtion, and therefore is of the utmoſt ſervice in caſes of indigeſtion, and general weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; it likewiſe renders the body leſs liable to the malignant influence of the weather, and to the attacks of putrid diſeaſes.</p>

                  <head>AIR.</head>
                  <p>The Patient ſhould reſide in a pure dry atmoſphere, becauſe pure air increaſes the elaſticity of the muſcular fibres, braces and invigorates the whole ſyſtem, ſupports the vitality of the blood, and greatly contributes to the reſtoration and preſervation of that principle in the animal economy called Irritability, on which health wholly depends: hence it facilitates the cure, not only of Indigeſtion, but alſo of nervous diſeaſes and general relaxation. If the air, which is either one of the moſt ſalutary or pernicious agents, be moiſt, or contaminated with noxious effluvia, it will render the conſtitution unhealthy, and alſo conſiderably impede the good effects of the remedy, let it be ever ſo powerful.</p>
                  <p>Foul air is peculiarly inimical to the nervous ſyſtem; it relaxes and enfeebles the general habit; and often produces diſeaſes of the lungs. In great cities, the air is vitiated by being impregnated with ſmoke, and various exhalations ariſing from putrid ſubſtances: hence many perſons, who are under the neceſſity of living ſome time in the unwholeſome atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere of this great metropolis, ſuffer materially in their health. Thoſe perſons, therefore, who are obliged to ſpend the day in cloſe towns, ought if poſſible to ſleep in the country. Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pure air in the night will compenſate in ſome meaſure for the want of it during the day. The patient s chamber ſhould be cool and ſpacious, the curtains of the bed kept conſtantly open, and the bed clothes ſo regulated as to maintain only a moderate degree of warmth.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0492600200:26"/>
                  <p>Places where a number of perſons are crowded together ought always to be well ventilated, eſpecially ſchools; and it is the duty of parents to pay particular attention to the manner in which their children are accommodated in this reſpect. The ſame caution is neceſſary with regard to nurſeries, ſervants being in general fond of hot and cloſe apartments. A few years ago, a remarkable inſtance occurred, which ſhews the dangerous effects of foul ſtagnant air: Eighteen children and a ſervant ſlept in one apartment, in King-ſtreet, Golden-ſquare; to render the room warmer, they ſhut up the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and uſed every other expedient to exclude the cold air: the conſequences of which were, that the ſervant and ten of the children were ſeized with excruciating pains in the pit of the ſtomach and back, violent head ach, delirium, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions.</p>
                  <p>A very general error prevails among mankind, in expoſing the body too much to the action of heat, with a view to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it from the pernicious effects of cold. The influence of the latter will be the leaſt conſiderable on thoſe perſons who are moſt frequently but prudently expoſed to its action. Thoſe who keep themſelves and their children conſtantly in a warm room, become greatly relaxed, and are ſeldom without a cold or cough, from which moſt of the conſumptions in this country originate; for if, in addition to the general debility ariſing from ſuch neglect of air and exerciſe, we conſider the effects of the medicines uſually preſcribed to cure the cough, (which, being generally compoſed of ſyrups and oils, muſt, it long continued, relax the ſtomach and pall the appetite) we need not wonder, if, inſtead of the cold being removed, an incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſumption is induced. This obſervation applies alſo to ſtudious men, who live a ſedentary life, in an atmoſphere which, being ſeldom renewed, is inelaſtic, and full of noxious vapours: by this they are relaxed, and rendered heavy and low ſpirited; and the bad effects ariſing from ſtudy and want of exerciſe, are greatly increaſed.</p>

                  <head>SEA, OR COLD BATHING.</head>
                  <p>Bathing being one of the principal remedies for indigeſtion general debility, and nervous diſeaſes, I ſhall here make a few obſervations reſpecting its uſe.</p>
                  <p>Nothing affords more ſtrength to the nervous ſyſtem, or produces a greater elaſticity of the muſcles and veſſels, than ſea or cold bathing; it accelerates the motion of the blood, and promotes the different ſecretions: for though the water only acts immediately on the cutaneous nerves and blood veſſels, yet, its benign influence, by ſympathy, is communicated to every part of the machine. But this, as well as all other grand remedies when improperly applied, will frequently produce the moſt baneful effects; it will radicate more deeply in the habit thoſe complaints which it was intended to cure, and render them for ever incurable.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, on reflection, this is not to be wondered at; for moſt perſons imagine themſelves qualified to judge, and boldly venture their opinion, of the propriety of Bathing, who have not the ſmalleſt acquaintance with anatomy, phyſiology, the hiſtory of diſeaſes, the ſcience of medicine, or philoſophy in general; and who, conſequently, are incapable of diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in reſpect to the diſeaſe, or the conſtitution of the patient; and certain it is, that no remedy whatever, can require a more accurate knowledge of theſe, than Bathing.</p>
                  <p>Under theſe conſiderations therefore, the following remarks are offered to the public, in order to obviate thoſe pernicious effects, which too frequently ariſe from an indiſcriminate uſe of Bathing.</p>
                  <p>Previous to laying down particular rules, it may be neceſſary to premiſe the two following general ones; that people may be able to form a judgment whether bathing is likely to be uſeful, or to prove injurious to the conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Where the patient, on coming out of the Bath, feels an univerſal pleaſant ſenſation of glowing warmth, the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0492600200:28"/>elaſticity of the muſcular ſibres ſeems increaſed; and the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſyſtem ſtrengthened, and as it were, re-animated; theſe are proofs that it agrees perfectly well with the conſtitution; and, if properly continued, will be of infinite ſervice: becauſe it thereby evidently appears, that the re-action of the heart and arteries is increaſed, and conſequently, an equal diſtribution of the blood and other fluids to every minute veſſel, is produced.</p>
                  <p>Second, But, on the contrary, where on coming out of the Bath, the patient feels a ſenſation of cold, attended with ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, depreſſion of ſpirits, pain in the head, or in any other part of the body, univerſal laſſitude or wearineſs, as though juſt come from hard labour; theſe are ſigns that bathing does not agree with the conſtitution; becauſe they evidently ſhew, that there is ſuch a defect of irritability in the habit, that the heart and arteries are unable to overcome that conſtriction of the cutane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous veſſels, which is the primary effect always produced by the application of cold to the ſurface of the body.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two general rules ſhould be particulary attended to; for by an accurate obſervance thereof, either a great deal of good may be done by bathing, or much miſchief prevented.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>CASES IN WHICH BATHING WILL BE BENEFICIAL,</head>
                  <p>Whenever there are ſymptoms of univerſal debility, ariſing from inanition, or want of due nouriſhment, ſuch as looſe or flabby muſcles, wearineſs or languor over the whole body, a ſenſe of fatigue, upon the ſlighteſt exertion of the muſcular ſyſtem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and an inclination to ſweat upon very little exerciſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In all nervous diſeaſes, eſpecial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y where there is an increaſed ſenſibility, as faintings, tremblings, depreſſion of ſpirits, alarm on every trifling occaſion, nervous head-ach, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The cold or ſea bathing ſhould be uſed in general, in the morning before any food has been taken; though, at the ſame time it may be neceſſary to obſerve, that ſome conſtitutions cannot bear it previous to a light breakfaſt; with ſuch it ſhould
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0492600200:29"/>be uſed between breakſaſt and dinner, but not ſo ſoon after the firſt meal as to interfere with digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>The frequency of bathing, and the time of continuing in the water, can only be determined by the nature of the complaint, and the ſtrength of the patient. It ſhould not be uſed oftener than three or four times a week, by perſons of a ſpare and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally delicate habit; and theſe perſons ſhould only make a ſingle immerſion, and come out immediately. Thoſe of greater ſtrength may uſe the bath more freely.</p>
                  <p>The beſt time for bathing, in general, is to commence about the middle of April, or beginning of May, according to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the ſeaſon, and to continue it no longer than a month, or ſix weeks at moſt; omitting it totally during the very ſultry months of ſummer; but it ſhould never be employed later in the ſeaſon than the beginning of November. By thus allowing an interval between the bathings, a ſalutary change may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the ſolids and fluids; whereas, had it been perſiſted in many months without intermiſſion, it would not only have loſt its tonic power, but debilitating effects might have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. I have frequently obſerved that the good effects of other tonic remedies as well as the cold bath are not always to be perceived during their uſe; for after taking them regularly about three weeks or a month with little or no apparent benefit; yet, en diſcontinuing them, I have been ſurpriſed at the very rapid manner in which the patient has recovered his health; which ſerves to prove that ſtrengthening remedies extend their effects much beyond the time during which they are employed.</p>
                  <p>A day or two previous to bathing, a proper doſe of the Tonic Powders ſhould be taken, (two papers will generally be ſufficient,) ſo as to procure two or three motions, in order to evacuate the crudities of the bowels; which would, if allowed to remain there, prevent the bathing having the deſired effect.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe, during the uſe of bathing, particular attention ſhould be paid to the ſtate of the ſtomach and bowels, eſpecially
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0492600200:30"/>in thoſe perſons who are troubled with a ſuperfluous quantity of bile; for, if this is neglected, many bad conſequences may enſue; as a congeſtion in the abdominal viſcera, fevers, violent pain in the head, and even apoplexy may be produced. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I recommend the Tonic Powders, becauſe they operate without producing any uneaſineſs, either in the alimentary canal, or the ſyſtem in general, and do not, like moſt purgatives, as I have before noticed, induce a conſtipation of the bowels, or languid ſtate of the body, after their operation; but by their tonic quality, they tend to ſtrengthen the digeſtive organs, and conſequently the whole habit, thereby favouring the intention with which the bath is employed.</p>
                  <p>Immediately on coming out of the bath, the body ſhould be wiped perfectly dry as expeditiouſly as poſſible—this promotes the circulation to the ſurface, and thereby aſſiſts in regulating the ſecretions, upon which moſt of the good effects of bathing depend.</p>
                  <p>The ſea bath is found more efficacious than the cold bath, owing to the water being impregnated with ſalt, which ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the cutaneous veſſels, and cauſes an increaſed determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fluids to the ſurface of the body. Upon this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I frequently order a quantity of ſalt to be added to the water in which the patient is to bathe at home, with very good effect. It has been computed that every gallon of ſea water contains five ounces and a half of ſalt; this therefore is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which the ſalt ſhould bear to the water, in which the patient is to bathe. The water and ſalt ſhould be renewed every other, or third day.</p>
                  <p>I have frequently known the beneficial effects of bathing greatly promoted, eſpecially in weakly, nervous habits, by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two tea-ſpoonfuls of the Tonic Drops, in a glaſs of water, as ſoon as the patient comes out of the bath; and, in the courſe of my practice, I have often obſerved, that univerſal, pleaſant, glowing ſenſations, &amp;c. take place, by the aſſiſtance of this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0492600200:31"/>medicine, where, without its ſalutary influence, bathing would have been prejudicial.</p>
                  <p>Having deſcribed the particular caſes, in which Sea or Cold Bathing will be found of the utmoſt benefit; I ſhall now point out thoſe particular ſtates of the ſyſtem in which its uſe would be very injurious.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt, When the patient labours under any actual diſeaſe, or obſtruction of any of the viſcera, either of the abdomen or thorax —Hence bathing is extremely improper in Conſumption of the Lungs, Aſthma, Jaundice, or in a diſeaſed ſtate of the liver, kidnies, bladder, or womb<note n="*" place="bottom">I have ſeen many dreadful effects produced by bathing, when the womb was diſeaſed—About two years ago, I attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a lady with an eminent ſurgeon, for a complaint of that part; of which ſhe was cured, apparently, in two months, except ſometimes a ſmall degree of pain.

This obſervation holds good with reſpect to the effects of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, in winter and ſpring; for, by reaſon of its coldneſs and preſſure, inflammatory complaints are more frequent at thoſe ſeaſons than in ſummer; and alſo conſumptive and aſthmatic diſorders are rendered more violent by the ſame means.</p>

                  <p n="7">7thly, While there exiſts a plethoric ſtate of the body, or too great a fulneſs of the blood veſſels—Becauſe an increaſed quantity of blood would be ſent to thoſe veſſels, already too much diſtended; ſo that there would be danger of rupturing them, or of exciting inflammation of the brain, or ſome of the viſcera. Inſtances daily occur, where inflammations, boils, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſes, and ulcerations, of the external parts, very difficult to heal, are, in that particular ſtate of the conſtitution above ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied occaſioned by bathing: for, although there may be evident ſigns of univerſal debility, which ſeem to indicate the propriety of bathing, yet it ſhould be remembered, that this debility may ariſe from general diſtention, and not from want of nutrition.— Theſe two ſpecies of debility require quite oppoſite remedies; therefore they ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from each other with the utmoſt accuracy, previous to bathing; by which means much miſchief may be prevented.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of Cold of Sea Bathing in this laſt caſe, the uſe of the Tonic Powders will be of infinite ſervice, owing to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining an evacuant power with their tonic quality. They ſhould be taken ſo as to procure three or four motions daily, and ſhould be perſiſted in for ten or twelve days, or while any uneaſy ſenſation remains</p>
                  <p n="8">8thly, During the preſence of the Haemorrhoids, or Piles— Becauſe the Cold Bath will, moſt probably, repel the blood ſuddenly from the haemorrhoidal veins, where nature had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited it, in order to relieve the general habit; ſo that, by the interruption given to her ſalutary operations, a determination to the head and lungs may enſue, and in conſequence many diſorders of thoſe parts, as well as a train of diſeaſes, may ariſe. I have known many inſtances where people have died of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the lungs, ariſing from the application of cold,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0492600200:34"/>by ſitting upon damp ground at that particular time, or by putting on a pair of ſmall clothes not properly aired.</p>
                  <p n="9">9th, While any natural periodical diſcharge continues — Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, many complaints of the moſt malignant nature may be produced. This obſervation ſhould be particularly attended to by women, whom it more immediately concerns.</p>
                  <p n="10">10th, Bathing ſhould not be made uſe of very ſoon after mebriation, or any other irregularity; becauſe the body would be too weak to bear the ſhock.</p>
                  <p n="11">11th, It ſhould not be uſed, but with the utmoſt caution, during the whole period of geſtation, or pregnancy — Becauſe during that time, eſpecially in the firſt months, the patient is ſeldom able to bear ſo ſudden a ſhock to the ſyſtem in general, or ſo great a determination to the womb in particular; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abortion, as well as great miſchief to the conſtitution, may be expected from the indiſcriminate uſe of bathing under that circumſtance.</p>
                  <p n="12">12th, Women in general ſhould never bathe, but upon the moſt urgent neceſſity, and then not without proper advice — Becauſe very few of them can bear ſo ſudden or ſo great a ſhock, owing to the exquiſite ſenſibility of their nerves, and the irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of their general ſyſtem, which exceeds thoſe of men. The ſame obſervation holds good with regard to children; many of whom I have known thrown into convulſions, as well as women into hyſteric fits, by the very ſudden and violent ſhock given to the nervous ſyſtem, by immerſion in cold water.</p>
                  <p>I am much againſt accuſtoming children to the cold bath, as the ingenious Dr. Buchan adviſes in his Domeſtic Medicine, at a very early age, (unleſs neceſſity abſolutely requires it), or continuing it too long. I have, for my own part, no notion of endeavouring to prevent complaints, which, in all probability, would never happen unleſs ſome or all of the occaſional cauſes on which moſt of the diſeaſes of children depend, were applied: ſuch as, food in too great a quantity, or of a pernicious
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0492600200:35"/>quality, want of due exerciſe, or cleanlineſs, and ſometimes confined air, By removing theſe cauſes, or, what is ſtill better, never applying them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhould, in ninety-nine caſes out of a hundred, find the cold bath, as well as all other remedies, unneceſſary. At the ſame time I wiſh it to be underſtood, that I have a very high opinion of cold bathing, when there is a real indication for its uſe; but, on the other hand, I think it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely cruel, to be teazing a child with a pretended remedy, while it is in perfect health. I have more exalted ideas of the great Author of Nature, than for one moment to imagine, that it is in the power of any remedy to render the conſtitution more perfect than it was intended by him.—</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>"For health, on exerciſe and food depend;</l>
                     <l>"God never made his works for man to mend."</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Cold Bathing is likewiſe improper at or near the time when a return of the gout is expected: for a little before the recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this diſeaſe, irregular determinations generally take place; ſometimes to the head, affecting it with pain and giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſometimes to the lungs, producing a difficulty of breathing; and ſometimes to the ſtomach and bowels, cauſing ſickneſs and pain. Bathing, at this time, would encourage theſe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and prevent the gout from fixing in its proper feat, the extremities; in conſequence of which, violent inflammations and the moſt fatal effects may follow.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould alſo be uſed with great circumſpection after the gout is gone off—becauſe, in general, the body is too much debilitated by that diſeaſe, to be able to bear the violence of the ſhock. For the ſame reaſon, bathing is improper in all caſes of extreme debility, from whatever cauſe it may ariſe.</p>
                  <p>Cold or ſea bathing cannot be ſafely employed during the action of any irritating cauſe in the ſyſtem—Becauſe that irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation would be much increaſed by the ſtrong re-action of the heart and arteries, which is one of the ſecondary effects of bathing. Hence it is improper in glandular obſtructions, when
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0492600200:36"/>they have arrived to a certain pitch. It can only be uſed with advantage in an incipient ſtate of the diſeaſe, and even then ſhould be employed with great caution.</p>
                  <p>The Sea Air and Exerciſe contribute greatly to the good effects of bathing, and very frequently prove extremely bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to thoſe perſons, in whoſe caſes bathing, according to the foregoing rules, is ſtrictly prohibited. In my opinion, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the patient has been often attributed to bathing, when in reality, it was merely owing to the following circumſtances:
<list>
                        <item>1ſt. The Purity and Coolneſs of the Sea Air:</item>
                        <item>2d. The Mind being totally diſengaged from Anxiety and Buſineſs.</item>
                        <item>3d. The Amuſements and Company of the Place, joined with Exerciſe.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sea Air is rendered by the water,—Firſt, More pure: Second, More cool.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, by the ſea water abſorbing thoſe impurities, or noxious particles, with which the air in large towns and cities is replete. For which reaſon, it muſt be better adapted to the purpoſes of reſpiration; as the oxygen, or baſis of vital air, thereby becomes increaſed in proportion; by which means, the blood is more fully impregnated with the vital principle.</p>
                  <p>Second, The air is rendered more cook, by its paſſing over ſo large a tract of water. Hence, near the ſea, are felt none of thoſe unpleaſant ſenſations which ariſe from the heat of the air in ſummer, in large cities or inland places; but a conſtant cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, refreſhing breeze is perceived, ſo congenial to the feelings, and ſo advantageous to the health of man; which moderates the exceſs of heat, prevents its irritating and debilitating effects, and produces the moſt ſalutary conſequences.</p>

                  <p>Diſeaſes more frequently originate from coſtiveneſs than has hitherto been imagined: and the ſucceſs I have met with in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0492600200:37"/>practice, by obviating this circumſtance, I am convinced juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the remark.</p>
                  <p>A great variety of aperient medicines have been preſcribed, to remove coſtiveneſs; ſuch as, lenitive electuary, infuſion of ſenna, aloes, Daffy's Elixir, ſulphur, &amp;c. Theſe I have uſed, with many others, but never yet found a medicine that will act with ſo much certainty and ſafety, as the Tonic Powders; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as obſerved before, they may be taken by perſons of any age, ſex, or under every circumſtance of the conſtitution; as they do not, like other opening medicines, excite an unnatural ſtimulus of the ſtomach and bowels, in order to produce their effect; nor does their operation, which is both mild and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, interfere with the occupations of life.</p>
                  <p>There is a peculiar coſtiveneſs, affecting ſtudious people, and thoſe advanced in years, which very frequently cauſes inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the bowels, often terminating fatally in the courſe of a few days: ſuch perſons ſhould never be without the Tonic Powers, but ſhould take them occaſionally as circumſtances may require. I have every reaſon to believe, that with theſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders I have preſerved the health of hundreds; as they are ſo benign in their effects, that they have invariably improved the conſtitution of thoſe who have taken them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe powders are widely different in their effects from Anderſon's, commonly called Scotch Pills, which are injurious to the conſtitution in the following reſpects:
<list>
                        <item>1ſt, Anderſon's Pills, after their purgative operation is over, leave a conſtipated ſtate of the bowels.</item>
                        <item>2dly, They heat the body, therefore cannot be employed, with propriety, in every conſtitution.</item>
                        <item>3dly, They ſtimulate the rectum, or lower bowel, thereby producing the Piles,—a highly diſagreeable and painful diſorder, which often terminates in fiſtula.</item>
                        <item>4thly, They have a peculiar effect in making women unwell at an improper time, owing to their ſtimulating the part men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0492600200:38"/>before, and are not only unſafe, but extremely danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, during pregnancy.</item>
                        <item>5thly. Aloes, of which theſe pills are compoſed, is of ſuch a nature, that, when the bowels become habituated to its uſe, they will not act properly without it; therefore, when once become a cuſtom, it muſt generally be continued through life.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the contrary, the Tonic Powders have quite different effects:
<list>
                        <item>1ſt. They induce a natural ſtate of the bowels, after they have operated as a purgative.</item>
                        <item>2dly, Inſtead of heating the body, they abate irritation, and render the patient cool and comfortable.</item>
                        <item>3dly, Inſtead of producing the Piles, they prevent or cure them, as numbers have experienced, who have taken them by my direction.</item>
                        <item>4thly, I have had repeated opportunities of proving the good effects of theſe powers in pregnancy, wherein they alleviate, or prevent, all the uncomfortable ſymptoms, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſickneſs and retching,) which occur during that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular period, with the utmoſt ſafety.</item>
                        <item>5thly, The Tonic Powders have quite a contrary tendency to the aloes; they not only produce a natural action of the bowels after being taken a little time, but may be left off without the leaſt inconvenience.</item>

                  <p>Theſe in general originate in a debility of the digeſtive organs, but ultimately ariſe from too great a determination of blood to the head, ſoul ſtomach, coſtive habit, an exquiſite ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the nerves, &amp;c. The Tonic Powders have repeatedly cured theſe complaints, after other medicines have proved ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>Where the pain of the head is periodical, or returns at regular ſtated times, from fifteen to twenty-five drops of tincture of opium, taken in water, half an hour before its return, or exactly

                  <p>Perſons afflicted with pain of the head, whether conſtant or periodical, ought to apply for a remedy in due time; for, if it continues long, it will deſtroy the ſenſibility of the nerves, (the common effect of pain,) and terminate in a privation of ſome one, or more, of the ſenſes; as, ſight, ſmelling, hearing, or taſte: even a palſy, or apoplexy, has too often been the conſequence of neglect in theſe caſes.</p>

                  <p>This complaint, for the moſt part, proceeds from inattention to diet, either in reſpect to quantity or quality, or both.— There are ſome things, which unleſs taken with the utmoſt caution, in ſome conſtitutions frequently occaſion the ſick head ach; ſuch are, melted butter, fat meats, and ſpices, eſpecially pepper Meat pies often contain all theſe things united, and are as fertile a cauſe of this diſeaſe as anything I know.

                  <p>Whenever the patient has been troubled with faintings, depreſſions of ſpirits, alternate ſhiverings and fluſhing heats, the Tonic Powders and Drops have cured great numbers of people, after various other methods had proved ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>The following Rules ſhould be attended to, during the cure of nervous diſeaſes:</p>
                  <p>The cauſes of Indigeſtion muſt be avoided.</p>
                  <p>The quantity and quality of the food ſhould be regarded: more muſt never be eaten, than will fit perfectly eaſy on the ſtomach; and that quality muſt be avoided, which is known to diſagree. Spoon diet ſhould be taken ſparingly, becauſe it weakens more than ſtrengthens the body: in ſhort, the ſolid food ſhould be increaſed, and the fluid aliment diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Animal food ſhould bear a greater proportion than Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, eſpecially in winter; particularly in thoſe perſons who are troubled with wind or acidity in the ſtomach. Roaſt meat is preferable to boiled.</p>
                  <p>The drink muſt not be heating or ſtimulating to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach: —I have known ſeveral people prevent the return of nervous complaints by taking no other drink than water. Drams muſt be avoided; for; though they may raiſe the ſpirits, and give preſent eaſe to a diſordered ſtomach, yet they will ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately increaſe the complaint.</p>
                  <p>The ſleep and reſt ſhould be at leaſt eight hours out of the twenty-four, ſometimes nine will be requiſite; for thoſe afflicted with theſe complaints, require a great deal of reſt, and ſome people hurt themſelves by a contrary practice.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0492600200:41"/>
                  <p>Exerciſe muſt be regularly uſed, but not a very fatiguing degree. The ſtomach and bowels ſhould be well rubbed, every night and morning, with the fleſh bruſh or flannel; which will prove of great ſervice to ſuch perſons as are afflicted with nervous complaints or wind in the ſtomach.</p>
                  <p>The mind ſhould be kept ſerene and tranquil, and ſtudy and diſputes, upon every conſideration, avoided.</p>
                  <p>A comfortable warmth ought always to be preſerved, but much heat ſhould be avoided.</p>
                  <p>Moiſt, contaminated, or confined air, produces debility and depreſſion of ſpirits, therefore it ſhould be exchanged for a dry and pure atmoſphere: hence the propriety of the country air, or that on the ſea coaſt. Thoſe nervous perſons, therefore, who are obliged to live always in London, or in cloſe towns, ſhould if poſſible reſide, for one or two months in the ſummer, on the ſea coaſt, which will increaſe the vitality of the blood, brace the relaxed nerves, and give tone to the muſcular fibres.</p>
                  <p>The ſea or cold bath ſhould be uſed, though with great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why a remedy for nervous complaints has not been more frequently obtained, is becauſe the patient becomes unſteady, owing to the length of time neceſſary to complete a cure, and runs from one phyſician to another till at laſt he becomes diſſatisfied, and loſes confidence in every medicine, though it may be calculated upon the beſt principle for curing the complaint.</p>

                  <p>It is diſtinguiſhed into the Regular and Irregular Gout.</p>
                  <p>Though the Regular Gout ſometimes ſeizes ſuddenly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſigns of its approach, when ſeemingly the patient is in the moſt perfect health; yet the fit is often preceded by ſome of the following ſymptoms: Loſs of appetite, acidity, flatulency, uneaſineſs and fulneſs of the ſtomach, general languor, various nervous ſymptoms, and a ſenſation as if cold water was trickling down the thighs; ſometimes a keen appetite takes place the day before the fit.</p>
                  <p>The patient, at the commencement of the Regular Gout, is waked about midnight, or one or two in the morning, with a very violent pain of the foot, generally in the great toe, but ſometime in the ancle, often attended with chillineſs and ſhivering, which are ſucceeded by ſome degree of fever. The pain increaſes every hour, and comes to its height towards evening, which becomes ſo exquiſite that the patient is ſcarce able to endure the weight of the bed clothes, nor the ſhaking of the room from a perſon's walking acroſs it; and hence the night is not only paſſed in pain, but likewiſe with a reſtleſs removal of the part affected from one place to another and a continual change of its poſture. The pain commonly remits in about twenty-four hours from the firſt approach of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0492600200:43"/>the fit, and then the patient falls aſleep, and a gentle moiſture comes over the whole body, as well as on the pained part, which then appears ſwelled and red,—In general the pain abates when the part ſwells. The patient continues eaſier through the day; the pain, with ſome degree of fever, increaſes towards evening, and after a reſtleſs night, they both remit in the morning with a gentle ſweat. The pain after being for ſometime fixt in one place, ſhifts to another, and in this way viſits moſt parts of the foot, and in a few days removes to the other foot, and affects it in the ſame manner.—The urine is high coloured, and not in the uſual quantity; but in the decline of the fit, it becomes copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, with a large ſediment;—during the fit there is uſually an uncommon flow of ſpirits, and clearneſs of underſtanding — When the fit is going off, the parts affected become violently itchy, eſpecially between the toes, the cuticle falls off and a lameneſs is left proportioned to the ſeverity and length of the diſeaſe.—The duration of the ſit is uncertain; but in general when the pain is moſt violent, it is of the ſhorteſt continuance, and the interval between the fits is longeſt.</p>
                  <p>Having deſcribed the regular Gout, I ſhall now mention thoſe ſymptoms which conſtitute the irregular or flying-gout.— The irregular ſeizes the hands, wriſts, elbows, knees, and other parts, as ſeverely as the regular gout did the ſeet. It often affects the ſtomach with very violent pain, ſickneſs, diſtention, and wind, the bowels with griping and fulneſs, the head with pain and giddineſs, the lungs with difficulty of breathing, and the kidnies with pain of the back, all of which alternate with pain and ſwellings of the joints —It frequently produces diſorders of the nervous ſyſtem, conſequently the mind becomes affected, which ſympathiſes with the body, ſo that it is not eaſy to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which of the two is moſt affected.—In feeble or broken conſtitutions, or when the diſeaſe has been of long duration, the fits become leſs ſevere, but continue longer, and the diſeaſe becomes more moveable.—After a regular fit of the gout, the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0492600200:44"/>patient enjoys perfect health, which is not the caſe after an irregular fit.</p>
                  <p>When the gout has continued long, it often produces chalky concretions, weakneſs, rigidity or ſtiffneſs of the joints, and ſometimes abſolute lameneſs.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe is not dangerous while confined to the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but often proves fatal when it ſhifts from them, and falls upon any of the internal parts, or where from a deficiency of vigour of the conſtitution, it cannot be propelled to its proper ſeat the feet.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes which produce indigeſtion, alſo occaſion the gout.</p>
                  <p>Authors, in general, have certainly been greatly miſtaken with regard to the treatment of the Gout: ſome have pretended to cure it by regimen alone, declaring that patience, good nurſing, and the application of flannel to the parts, were all that poſſibly could be done during the fit: and that diet, air, and exerciſe, were only to be depended upon to prevent a return. This doctrine has much influenced our preſent trifling mode of practice, and has occaſioned the ruin of many conſtitutions; for, conſonant to this opinion, they have laid down rules reſpecting diet, quite oppoſite to thoſe the patient had been accuſtomed to; and thoſe perſons, who have adhered thereto, have ſuffered more by intervening diſeaſes, than they would have done, had they perſiſted in their uſual mode of high living; for ſudden changes, in that reſpect, in the intervals, are always attended with ſome degree of hazard, and when the conſtitution is debilitated, with the utmoſt danger. Whenever a change therefore, in point of regimen is neceſſary, it ſhould be made gradually.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe authors again who have relied on medicines alone for a cure, have been nder as great an error as thoſe who have wholly depended on regimen: although Medicines may remove the preſent ſymptoms, yet, while the cauſe of the diſeaſe is acting, the effect muſt again recur, and, in all probability with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0492600200:45"/>redintegrated ſtrength, when the patient returns to his former habits.</p>
                  <p>In order to cure the Gout, on a true principle the following rules muſt be ſtrictly adhered to:
<list>
                        <item>1ſt The action of the ſtomach and bowels ſhould be affiſted, and the indigeſtible matter, from time to time, gently evacuated downwards, which theſe organs are not able to do of themſelves, owing to the contractile power thereof being ſo much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</item>
                        <item>2d. The tone of the digeſtive organs ſhould be increaſed.</item>
                        <item>3d. The general and nervous ſyſtem ſhould be ſtrengthened.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are to be accompliſhed by medicines, joined to the following rules reſpecting regimen:
<list>
                        <item>1ſt. Proper diet, both in quantity and quality, ſhould be adopted. Vegetables ſhould be taken ſparingly, in proportion to animal food, by thoſe perſons who are troubled with wind and acidity in the ſtomach.</item>
                        <item>2d. Exerciſe, according to the ſtrength of the patient, ſhould be regularly performed. Univerſal experience of this diſeaſe being unknown to labouring people, is ſufficient to prove that exerciſe is a good aſſiſtant in the prevention and cure of the gout.</item>
                        <item>3d. Wholeſome air, and natural reſt, ſhould be duly attended to.</item>
                        <item>4th. Cold or ſea bathing, ſhould be judiciouſly employed.</item>
                        <item>5th. The cauſes of this diſeaſe, mentioned under indigeſtion, ought to be avoided.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Tonic Powders and Drops, are a ſafe and efficacious remedy for the gout; and I can affirm, that, in my practice, which has been upwards of ſixteen years, during which time I have attended great numbers of gouty patients, they have always produced the following effects:</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. They lengthen the interval between the fits—2dly, They ſhorten the duration of the fit, when preſent—3dly, They abate
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0492600200:46"/>the violence of the pain—4thly, They take off the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diatheſis of the ſyſtem, conſequently they tend to remove the topical inflammation. 5th, During the fit they prevent the uſual debility taking place, and ſtrengthen the conſtitution in the intervals.—6th. When the gout ſeizes the ſtomach, that organ becomes ſo cold and torpid, that neither wine nor ſpirits ſeem ſtronger than water, in this caſe the Tonie Drops have moſt admirable effects.</p>
                  <p>Though I do not pretend, with theſe medicines to perform impoſſibilities, yet my experience of their effects induces me to believe, that by the uſe of the Tonic Powders and Drops, the Gout may be eraſed from the liſt of thoſe diſeaſes, which have hitherto obtained the appellation of <hi>opprobria medicina,</hi> or incurable.</p>
                  <p>Where the pain and inflammation of the feet are violent, I have experienced the good effects of the application of leeches, either on the inflamed part, or as near to it as poſſible; the latter generally anſwers better than when applied immediately on the part itſelf. Dr. Dover ſtrongly recommends a thin beef ſteak to be applied to the affected part, as a topical remedy for the gout; and Dr. Williams, who has written a very ingenious treatiſe, has ordered it, with very extraordinary good effects, where the inflammation has not been too great, or the parts too much debilitated; it opens the pores, and diſcharges the gouty matter ſo plentifully by perſpiration, that if it is not changed, at leaſt every two hours, it grows putrid and becomes offenſive: in fact, it appears to have all the good effects of a warm cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm, without irritating the affected parts.</p>
                  <p>The affected parts ſhould not be kept too warm: at the ſame time, a comfortable warmth ſhould by all means be preſerved.</p>
                  <p>The treatment reſpecting food and drink, during the fit, muſt be ſuited to the patient's age, conſtitution, and the violence of the diſorder; the accuſtomed mode of living ſhould likewiſe be attended to; for example, if the patient is young, the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtrong, the general and local inflammation high, ſolid ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0492600200:47"/>food, fermented and other ſtrong liquors, muſt be avoided: and a cooling farinacious diet and diluting drinks made uſe of. This will co-operate with the medicine, in leſſening the violence, and ſhortening the duration of the ſit.</p>
                  <p>But, on the contrary, if the patient be advanced in years, or the conſtitution much debiliated; or if there be the leaſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n of the internal parts being affected by the diſeaſe, a more generous diet muſt be adopted, with the liberal uſe of Madeira wine, ſherry, &amp;c. Being very abſtemious, in this caſe, would be highly dangerous to the patient.</p>
                  <p>The preſent mode of treating the gout indiſcriminately, with wine, hot cordials, and rich food, muſt be reprobated by every judicious practitioner, as it tends to increaſe the inflammation already in the blood, to heighten the fever, and to render the fit more ſevere as well as of longer duration, and at the ſame time ſtrengthens the popular opinion of the gout being incurable.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the fit is over, means ſhould be uſed to brace and ſtrengthen the relaxed fibres, to give force to the weakened muſcles, and to put the conſtitution into a ſtate, capable of reſiſting the diſorder for the future. For this purpoſe, the Tonic Powders and Drops I have found preferable to every other medicine, eſpecially when united to a proper regimen.</p>
                  <p>Exerciſe ſhould alſo be employed in the intervals of the Gout, together with theſe medicines, which, in conjunction with temperance, have been frequently known radically to cure the diſeaſe, even in caſes where a ſtrong hereditary diſpoſition had previouſly exiſted.</p>
                  <p>During the intervals of the fit, the diet, air, and exerciſe ſhould be the ſame as recommended under Indigeſtion.</p>

                  <head>DROPSY.</head>
                  <p>Before I enter upon the cure of the Dropſy, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to premiſe a few remarks, in order to ſhew the manner in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0492600200:48"/>which this diſeaſe is produced, and to point out the true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon which the Tonic Powders and Drops act, in effecting the cure</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe is primarily occaſioned by indigeſtion and debility; but ultimately it is produced—either, by the exhalent veſſels pouring a ſuperfluous quantity of watery fluid into the cavities of the body:—or, by the abſorbents being rendered unable to take up the proper quantity of fluid, which ſhould be re conveyed into the circulation:—and ſometimes, the Dropſy is the effect of both of theſe cauſes.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have obſerved before, in order to render this matter more perſpicuous, that the peculiar uſe of the exhalents is to pour a fluid into every cavity of the ſyſtem, deſigned by the great Author of nature, to lubricate the parts, in order to facilitate motion.—It is a well-known fact in philoſophy, that the action and re-action of all ſolid bodies, are much facilitated by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening fluid, without which, attrition would ſoon deſtroy that power of coheſion and attraction by which all bodies are held together, and conſequently motion would be totally impeded.</p>
                  <p>The office of the abſorbents is to take up that portion of the fluid which remains after anſwering the purpoſe above mentioned, and to convey it into the general maſs, in order to give room for a freſh ſupply.—Where theſe two ſets of veſſels, viz. the exhalents and abſorbents, do not act in equilibrium, a dropſy, partial or general, muſt enſue.</p>
                  <p>The Tonic Powders, as I have before obſerved, empower the animal machine to regulate every ſecretion, and in this diſeaſe, they increaſe the action of the abſorbents, by which means that ſuperabundant fluid is taken up, which had been left by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halents in the cavities of the body. At the ſame time, aſſiſted by the Tonic Drops, they ſtrengthen the digeſtive organs, and corroborate the general habit Upon theſe principles, they not only cure the diſeaſe, but prevent its return.</p>
                  <p>With regard to exerciſe and air, during the uſe of theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, what has been ſaid under Indigeſtion, applies alſo to this caſe.</p>

                  <p>I have known the Tonic Powders and Drops to ſucceed in the cure of Jaundice, in many inſtances, after other remedies had been tried to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Tonic Powders will not only be found efficacious in confirmed Jaundice, but alſo in thoſe ſlighter caſes, where the ſkin aſſumes a temporary yellow caſt, frequently ariſing from too great a quantity of bile, perturbation of mind, want of natural reſt, or the too liberal uſe of ſpirits.</p>

                     <hi>WORMS,</hi> Or Big Bellies in Children.</head>
                  <p>The cauſe of the above is indigeſtion, or weakneſs of the ſtomach and bowels, ariſing from too great indulgence in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper food, want of due exerciſe, unwholeſome or confined air;—theſe cauſes are ſometimes all united, but the firſt errors in diet, are by far the moſt frequent.</p>
                  <p>Whenever children are affected with diminiſhed ſtrength and ſpirits, with reluctance to exerciſe, the appetite decreaſed at one time, voracious at another, ſwelled belly, ſtarting in the ſleep, fever, difficulty of breathing, convulſions, thirſt, coſtiveneſs, ſtrong diſagreeable breath, &amp;c. the Tonic Powders I have found to anſwer every wiſhed for purpoſe; as they evacuate whatever indigeſtible matter may be lodged in the ſtomach and bowels, whether worms, ſlime, or phlegm; they relieve the difficulty of breathing, take off the fever, aad remove coſtiveneſs; they reſtore the appetite, ſtrengthen the conſtitution, and alſo are very ſucceſsful in reducing the big bellies, which are ſo frequently obſerved in children. In theſe eaſes, after every thing elſe had been tried in vain, and the child's life abſolutely deſpaired of, I have known this medicine, with proper diet, wholeſome air, and due exerciſe, perform a cure.</p>
                  <p>The ſtomach of children ſhould be preſerved from ſtrong diet; by the neglect of this precaution, they are found to labour under indigeſtion, worms, rickets, and univerſal debility.</p>

                  <p>Every year, for a long time paſt, nearly a thouſand children have been brought to me for advice in different complaints; but three-fourths of that number are afflicted in the manner above deſcribed: theſe I have generally been ſucceſsful enough to cure.</p>
                  <p>As grown up perſons are frequently troubled with worms, as well as children, I ſhall mention thoſe ſymptoms by which their preſence may be known.</p>
                  <p>When worms are in the ſtomach, they produce an inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pain, anxiety, inquietude, nauſea, and a flux of ſpittle, a foetid breath, grinding of the teeth, the countenance is now pale, then red; there is an itching of the noſtrils, with an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to vomit, and a dry and troubleſome cough by fits, and ſometimes fainting.</p>
                  <p>When they are contained in the inteſtines, they produce the following ſymptoms:—The belly is much diſtended, as though the patient was afflicted with a windy dropſy, with now and then a purging, but ſometimes a coſtiveneſs is preſent, the upper parts waſte away, inſomuch that the bones are viſible, and yet the appetite is great, the face is generally pale and tumid, and a cough, fever, and pleuritic pains are often produced.</p>
                  <p>The ſmall, like book worms, called aſcarides, are contained in the rectum or lower bowel, and are ſometimes thrown out in great quantities; they produce inflation of the belly, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and nauſea; they are attended with great itchings of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>FEMALE COMPLAINTS.</head>
                  <p>There are two critical periods in the life of females, in which the general habit undergoes a material change, namely the COMMENCEMENT and CESSATION.—The firſt happens between the age of fourteen and ſixteen years; and the latter commonly from the age of forty-five to fifty. I ſhall make a few remarks reſpecting the management neceſſary to be obſerved at both theſe particular times, as on this frequently depends a good or bad ſtate of health.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with that period which commences at the early part of life.</p>
                  <p>Indigeſtion and general debility are the cauſes of this ſalutary change not happening in due time; becauſe the juices derived from the food, being, crude and watery, are inſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the body with due nouriſhment; hence the heart, which is the principal inſtrument of circulation, can hardly drive forward the blood in its veſſels, or diſtribute that vital fluid to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the body; therefore its due offices cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: hence proceed obſtructions, attended with ſickneſs flatulency, palpitation of the heart, head-ach, and a throbbing or tremulous motion of the internal parts, eſpecially after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, or ſudden ſurpriſe, heart-burn, and a ſwelling of the ſtomach; the patient's appetite is whimſical, and much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, often directing her to things void of nouriſhment, and improper, ſuch as chalk, cinders, ſour raw fruits, and the like. The countenance is ſometimes wan and ſallow, with a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paleneſs of the lips and gums, and exceſſive coldneſs of the feet, wearineſs, depreſſion of ſpirits, reluctance to exerciſe wandering pains and ſlow fever.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0492600200:52"/>
                  <p>In order to promote this ſalutary alteration, the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution muſt be ſtrengthened, which will aid the powerful efforts of nature, a circumſtance of the utmoſt cenſequence to the patient's future welfare, though too generally diſregarded. Which can only be done by ſuch medicines as are calculated to give ſtrength to the digeſtive organs, and tone to the general ſyſtem, united to proper diet, moderate exerciſe, and natural reſt, which will inevitably empower the animal oeconomy to effect this grand office; by the ſame means the ſecretions will be promoted, and thoſe diſorders, which before had reſiſted the moſt powerful medicines, nature will be enabled to remedy herſelf: but, unleſs the debility be removed, it will be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remedy theſe complaints.</p>
                  <p>Whenever therefore this ſalutary alteration does not take place in due time, or an accidental obſtruction has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, I have preſcribed the Tonic Powders and Drops, with the happieſt effect, even after the uſual courſe of medicines had been adminiſtered without any benefit.</p>
                  <p>Parents and guardians, or thoſe intruſted with the important office of ſuperintending the health and education of young ladies, ſhould direct their conduct with the utmoſt care and attention, at this critical juncture, for on the ſeaſonable commencement, and regular returns of nature, depends their future health.—</p>
                  <p>The engagement of the mind, the degree of exerciſe, the quantity and quality of the food, together with the nature of the air they breathe, ſhould be regarded with the moſt prudent caution.</p>
                  <p>The quantity and quality of food ſhould be ſuited to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive power of the ſtomach.—She ſhould eat often, and in ſmall quantities, of what is light and ſimple, and thoroughly maſticate, or chew it, which is a circumſtance of much more conſequence to thoſe who have weak ſtomachs than is generally imagined. The drink ſhould be light and rather nouriſhing but not heating; no heat ſhould be thrown into the habit but
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0492600200:53"/>what is obtained from exerciſe: this promotes the natural action of the heart and lungs, whereby a quantity of air will be taken into the blood, which will produce all the beneficial effects of a gentle ſtimulus, without preternaturally heating the ſyſtem; ſhe ſhould abſtain from the immoderate uſe of watery fluids, coffee is more wholeſome than tea, drunk with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of milk.</p>
                  <p>Moderate exerciſe, in the open air ſhould be uſed; this will at firſt, fatigue the weak patient, and put her out of breath; but when ſteadily perſiſted in, ſhe will daily gain ſtrength and ſpirits; ſo that what was before a puniſhment, will afterwards become a pleaſing amuſement; ſhe ſhould walk, or ride in the air, an hour or two, every day before dinner, when the weather will admit.</p>
                  <p>The cold bath, where there is no decay of the lungs, or other internal parts, will greatly aſſiſt the cure by bracing the ſolids: but this, being a remedy of a powerful kind, ought never to be uſed without proper advice, as many inſtances have occurred where ſuch as laboured under conſumptive ſymptoms, with weak ulcerated lungs, &amp;c. have been deſtroyed by its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable uſe.</p>
                  <p>Though forcing and heating medicines are preſcribed indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately to every female at this time; and believed by mothers to be ſpecifics and infallible; yet they are dangerous and unnatural, and have ruined the health of thouſands; for they act either by ſtimulating the lower bowel, or heating the body, (in ſome, ſuch as the aloes, both theſe effects are united,) which, inſtead of diminiſhing, tends to increaſe the cauſe from whence the complaint originated: nature, on the contrary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhes her deſigns by ſlow degrees, and conſequently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violence to the conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>For a fuller account of food, air, and exerciſe, ſee the remarks under Indigeſtion: alſo for the uſe of the Cold Bath, ſee the obſervations on that head.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall now treat of thoſe complaints which happen between the commencement and ceſſation of theſe two periods in which the Tonic Medicines will be of infinite ſervice. I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a great number of ladies, who, owing to their ill ſtate of health, were either never pregnant at all, or elſe could never arrive at the full time. By ſtrengthening the whole conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Tonic Medicines, joined to a proper diet and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, with a diſcreet uſe of the cold bath, I have had the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of recovering the health of my patients, and afterwards of delivering them of very fine, healthy children,</p>
                  <p>The following caſe often occurs in practice, which is very difficult to remedy, if not attended to in proper time:— A woman, apparently of a healthy conſtitution, is ſeized with a total ſuppreſſion, obſtruction, or diſcontinuance. For many months, ſome women feel very little inconvenience under this circumſtance: while others ſoon grow big, with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and pain in the belly, and ſome enlargement of the breaſts, ſickneſs in the mornings, diſlike to particular foods, and other ſymptoms ſimilar to pregnancy,—and married women believe themſelves in this ſituation, and imagine that they actually perceive the child, and are ſometimes not undeceived till the time of geſtation is much exceeded.—The Tonic Powders and proper attention to diet will effectually remove theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
                  <p>Another caſe has often occurred to me in practice: namely— A violent ſpaſmodic pain, apparently in the ſtomach and bowels, takes places, in both married and ſingle women, previous to every time of their being unwell, and ſometimes during the whole time of their being ſo: Nothing is more excruciating to the patient; it greatly impairs the health, and prediſpoſes the body to dangerous diſeaſes.—This is a moſt ſerious evil, and ſhould be particularly attended to. By the following method, I have been happy enough to prevent a return:—The moment the pain is coming on, I always give
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0492600200:55"/>fifteen or twenty drops of Tincture of Opium, and (if needful) repeat it every four hours: it is ſcarcely ever neceſſary to give more than two doſes, before it anſwers every wiſhed-for purpoſe. The patient ſhould keep in, or upon the bed, at leaſt in a recumbent poſture, and drink moderately of any diluting warm liquor, ſuch as black tea, weak whey, thin broth, &amp;c. I have, in this caſe alſo, preſcribed the Tonic Powders, with the moſt happy effect.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now treat of the management neceſſary to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the CESSATION, or that particular period when Nature Is about to make that change in the conſtitution, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally happens about the age of forty-five, or from thence to fifty. Some women, at this time, feel no material alteration in their health; others, after a total ceſſation, have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced much greater vigour of conſtitution than they had known for many years before; but there are others who ſuffer ſo much inconvenience from this ſource, as to render ſome aſſiſtance neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>About the time when this particular change in the habit takes place, many women experience complaints which prove extremely troubleſome, and, if neglected, very dangerous:— ſuch as, fluſhing heats, reſtleſsneſs, want of ſleep, troubleſome or frightful dreams, ſpaſmodic pains of the ſtomach and bowels, and ſometimes ſwelled ancles, with pain and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. After this alteration has taken place, ſometimes women ſuddenly grow bigger and grow unwieldy; their legs ſwell, their body is coſtive, the urine in ſmall quantities and often diſcharged with every appearance of the Dropſy.—The Tonic Powders and Drops, in the two laſt caſes, with regular exerciſe, I have never known to fail in effecting a cure. Strong purgatives which are generally preſcribed, prove extremely injurious.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0492600200:56"/>
                  <p>A proper regimen at this period ſhould be attentively obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—Thoſe females. who are of a full habit of body, ſubject to feveriſh heats, and of a ſtrong conſtitution, ſhould adhere to a moderately cooling and light diet; every thing that is heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be religiouſly avoided, eſpecially ſpirits, and even wine ought to be taken in great moderation; the patient ſhould leſſen the uſual quantity of animal food, and abſtain from meat ſuppers, the liberal uſe of vegetables, with a proper degree of exerciſe, and pure cool air ſhould be attended to; large aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, or hot cloſe rooms, ſhould be avoided. As the mind has great influence over bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly health, it is eſſentially neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to keep that as tranquil as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>But where the patient is weakly, and not troubled with feveriſh heats, and is of a thin habit of body, a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diet ſhould be allowed; a glaſs or two of wine after dinner and ſupper may be needful; at the ſame time, whatever will induce an unnatural heat, eſpecially ſpirituous liquors, muſt be avoided, Proper exerciſe and wholeſome air ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. The ſea or cold bathing may be uſed with great advantage, where the lungs or other internal parts are ſound,</p>
                  <p>Thoſe medicines, on which females place great reliance, uſually taken at this period, being very injurious, <hi>I</hi> ſhall enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate ſome of their baneful effects:</p>
                  <p>Theſe are not only extremely pernicious to the conſtitution, but produce moſt dreadful diſorders of the womb.—The Scotch Pills, Hoopers Female Pills, Analeptic, and, in ſhort, the whole tribe of pills, in general uſe for this purpoſe; are all detrimental to the animal oeconomy. Aloes, of which theſe pills are compoſed, though a good medicine in itſelf, has been fatally abuſed, and has done more miſchief than any other
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0492600200:57"/>drug whatever. Its operation is diametrically oppoſite to the real intention of nature; for it determines the blood to the womb, and ſtrongly ſtimulates it and the contiguous parts, which conſequently promotes the periodical diſcharge at a time when naturally it is about to ceaſe. Whatever tends to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the flow, when it is the law of nature to decline that particular office, muſt certainly be injurious. Inflammation, ulceration, and cancer of the womb, with floodings, more frequently ariſe from the effects of theſe pills, than have been hitherto known or imagined.</p>
                  <p>During ſuckling, many perſons are in the habit of taking Scotch and Hoopers Pills, with a view to keep the body open, — but this practice tends to interrupt the natural proceſs, by leſſening the quantity of milk and injuring its quality. In theſe caſes, Lenitive Electuary, Senna tea, with Cream of Tartar, and Caſtor Oil, are preſerable to either the Scotch or Hooper's Pills; but the TONIC POWDERS are, for this purpoſe, far ſuperior to any other medicine.</p>
                  <p>My worthy friend, the late Dr. FOTHERGILL, (whoſe abilities, honor, and veracity, no one with juſtice ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,) has made many judicious remarks reſpecting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious effects of thoſe medicines, which are compoſed of aloes, and preſcribed for women at this particular time. He ſays—</p>
                  <p>"An opinion generally prevails among the ſex, that purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are particularly neceſſary at this juncture; preparations of aloes are, therefore, recommended, from one to another, as proper purgatives to be uſed at this particular period.</p>
                  <p>"But, if we reflect upon the known effects of this drug, in all its preparations, we ſhall find it almoſt uniformly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0492600200:58"/>the piles, if taken long together, from its ſtimulating the veſſels at the extremity of the Rectum, called the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoidal Veins, and the contiguous parts.</p>
                  <p>"Inſtead, therefore, of countenancing a treatment, which is not only unreaſonable in theory, but injurious in practice—every opportunity ought to be embraced to expoſe and correct a popular error, than which there perhaps are few in the circle of medicine that are more miſchievous. Repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have occurred in my practice, of grievous inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ariſing from theſe heating medicines; the piles, ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury, racking pains in the loins, repreſenting labour pains, and other ſimilar complaints."</p>

By attending to your advice, and taking your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines regularly, the fit of the Gout was perfectly cured in a fourth part of the time it uſually laſted, when leſt to its own courſe. I had before been often afflicted with this diſorder, which continued ſo long each time as to make my feet extremely tender, my ancles and legs ſo weak, and my whole body ſo very feeble, that I was never able to walk, with any degree of eaſe or comfort, in leſs than two or three months; but this laſt time by the uſe of your medicines my health was ſo far eſtabliſhed in three weeks, as to feel as if nothing had ailed me."</p>

            <p>A YOUNG LADY was afflicted many months with the Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Gout: the ſeverity of the pains (which were without intermiſſion) deprived her of reſt, had reduced her ſtrength, and emaciated her body to ſuch a degree, that ſhe was unable to get out of bed, or even to ſeed herſelf. She had taken va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious medicines before ſhe ſent to me without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the leaſt benefit from them: on the contrary, the diſorder daily increaſed, and (her ſtrength being nearly exhauſted by pain, want of ſleep, and loſs of appetite) her recovery was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of by every one who ſaw her. Under theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhe was perſuaded to ſend for me, after I had attended her, and given her my medicines for about one month, all her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were removed, except a ſmall degree of weakneſs from which ſhe ſoon recovered.</p>

            <p>Mr. DAVIES, No. 10, New Compton Street, was afflicted with a moſt violent Rheumatic Gout for ſeveral months, in his limbs and head, which was always conſiderably increaſed by the warmth of the bed: —from the long continuance of the diſeaſe and the ſeverity of the pain, and by the loſs of ſtrength, appetite, and reſt, he was almoſt worn out. He had taken a large quantity of various kinds of medicines, but without the leaſt benefit....At length, however, hearing of my remarkable ſucceſs in the treatment of this and other complaints, he put himſelf under my care; and, by perſiſting in the uſe of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies about five weeks, he received a perfect cure.</p>
            <p>MR. SEALY, No. 1, Compton Street Bloomſbury, was afflicted with the Rheumatic Gout in all his limps, for the ſpace of ſix months. The violence of the pain was ſo extreme as to deprive him of reſt and to reduce his ſtrength greatly; he had violent head-ach, cough, colliquative ſweats, intermitting fever and thirſt, and was emaciated to a great degree. During all this time a variety of medicine had been preſcribed, without producing any benefit. At length he applied to me, and after taking my medicines, and ſtrictly following my advice, he got entirely rid of all his complaints in the courſe of two weeks, except a degree of weakneſs, for which he took the Tonic Drops, joined to a preparation of the Peruvian Bark: by which method, together with a nouriſhing diet, and now and then interpoſing the Tonic Powders when coſtive, his health was re-eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>A GENTLEWOMAN, aged eighty years, was afflicted with, the Dropſy, which began in her feet and legs, and was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with violent ſickneſs at the ſtomach, loſs of appetite, flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, uneaſineſs in the ſtomach and bowels, extreme reſtleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſuch a degree of debility, that ſhe was as helpleſs as a child. After taking my Tonic Powders and Drops regularly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0492600200:67"/>twice 3 day, for three weeks, the Dropſy was cured, and her health perfectly reſtored.</p>
            <p>A CHILD, about four years of age, was ſeized with a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical ſwelling of the face (two weeks after having a nettle raſh), which proceeded to the hands, feet, and legs; and the body appeared ſimilar to a mere lump of dough, attended with great difficulty of breathing, loſs of appetite, ſuppreſſion of urine, very high fever, reſtleſſneſs, and inſatiable thirſt. Under theſe alarming circumſtances, the child's life was (with great reaſon, deſpaired of. Different remedies had been uſed, but without the leaſt benefit. In this ſtate, I was applied to, and preſcribed the Tonic Powders as the moſt probable means of relief—the child was perfectly cured in a fortnight.</p>
            <p>A SERVANT to Mr. RYDER, Tobacconiſt, Broad-ſtreet, Bloomſbury, was a long time troubled with very violent ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the ſtomach, diſtention, and flatulence of the bowels, difficulty of breathing, cough, total loſs of appetite, pain of the head, languor, tremblings, fatigue on the leaſt motion, cold ſhiverings, and fluſhing of heat by turns, and a debility of the whole ſyſtem; theſe ſymptoms at length terminated in the Dropſy. He was perfectly cured, and his general health re-eſtabliſhed, by taking the Tonic Powders and Drops only three weeks.</p>
