            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The great fault of this piece, written by Dr. Parnell, is, that it is in eight ſyllable lines, very improper for the ſolemnity of the ſubject; otherwiſe, the poem is natural, and the reflections juſt.</p>

               <p>Mr. Thomſon, though, in general, a verboſe and affected poet, has told this ſtory with unuſual ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity: it is rather given here for being much eſteemed by the public, than by the editor.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>THE lovely young Lavinia once had friends;</l>
            <l>And Fortune ſmil'd, deceitful, on her birth.</l>
            <l>For, in her helpleſs years, depriv'd of all,</l>
            <l>Of every ſtay, ſave Innocence and Heaven,</l>
            <l>She, with her widow'd mother, feeble, old,</l>
            <l>And poor, liv'd in a cottage, far retir'd</l>
            <l>Among the windings of a woody vale;</l>

            <l>Together thus they ſhunn'd the cruel ſcorn</l>
            <l>Which virtue, ſunk to poverty, would meet</l>
            <l>From giddy paſſion and low-minded pride:</l>
            <l>Almoſt on Nature's common bounty fed;</l>
            <l>Like the gay birds that ſung them to repoſe,</l>
            <l>Content, and careleſs of tomorrow's fare.</l>
            <l>Her form was freſher than the morning roſe,</l>

            <l>Still on the ground dejected, darting all</l>
            <l>Their humid beams into the blooming flowers:</l>
            <l>Or when the mournful tale her mother told,</l>
            <l>Of what her faithleſs fortune promis'd once,</l>
            <l>Thrill'd in her thought, they, like the dewy ſtar</l>

            <l>Beyond the pomp of dreſs; for lovelineſs</l>
            <l>Needs not the foreign aid of ornament,</l>

            <l>Thoughtleſs of beauty, ſhe was beauty's ſelf,</l>
            <l>Recluſe amid the cloſe-embowering woods.</l>

            <l>So flouriſh'd blooming, and unſeen by all,</l>

            <l>With ſmiling patience in her looks, ſhe went</l>

            <argument>
               <p>Almoſt all things written from the heart, as this certainly was, have ſome merit. The poet here deſcribes ſorrows and misfortunes which were by no means imaginary; and, thus, there runs a truth of thinking through this poem, without which it would be of little value, as Savage is, in other reſpects, but an indifferent poet.</p>

            <l>His firſt-born lights no prejudice confounds.</l>
            <l>He, kindling from within, requires no flame:</l>
            <l>He glories in a baſtard's glowing name.</l>

            <argument>
               <p>This bagatelle, for which, by the bye, Mr. Prior has got his greateſt reputation, was a tale told in all the old Italian collections of jeſts, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from thence by Fontaine. It had been tranſlated once or twice before into Engliſh, yet was never regarded till it fell into the hands of Mr. Prior.

            <l>That if weak women went aſtray,</l>
            <l>Their ſtars were more in fault than they:</l>
            <l>Whole tragedies ſhe had by heart:</l>
            <l>Enter'd into Roxana's part:</l>
            <l>To triumph in her rival's blood,</l>
            <l>The action, certainly, was good.</l>

            <argument>
               <p>This poem is very fine; and, though in the ſame ſtrain with the preceding, is yet ſuperior.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>IN ancient times, as ſtory tells,</l>
            <l>The ſaints would often leave their cells,</l>
            <l>And ſtrole about, but hide their quality,</l>
            <l>To try good people's hoſpitality.</l>
            <l>It happen'd on a winter night,</l>
            <l>As authors of the legend write,</l>
            <l>Two brother hermits, ſaints by trade,</l>
            <l>Taking their tour in maſquerade,</l>
            <l>Diſguis'd in tatter'd habits, went</l>
            <l>To a ſmall village down in Kent;</l>
            <l>Where, in the ſtrollers' canting ſtrain,</l>
            <l>They begg'd from door to door, in vain;</l>
            <l>Try'd ev'ry tone might pity win,</l>
            <l>But not a ſoul would let 'em in.</l>
            <l>Our wand'ring ſaints, in woful ſtate,</l>
            <l>Treated at this ungodly rate,</l>

            <l>The gentle pilgrims, ſoon aware on't,</l>

            <l>OF Leinſter, fam'd for maidens fair,</l>
            <l>Bright Lucy was the grace;</l>
            <l>Nor e'er did Liffy's limpid ſtream</l>

A modern reader will chiefly be ſtruck with the ſtrength of thinking, and the turn of the compliments beſtowed upon the uſurper. Every body has heard the anſwer our poet made Charles II; who aſked him how his poem upon Cromwell came to be finer than his panegyric upon himſelf.

            <head>AN ESSAY ON POETRY.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>This work, by the duke of Buckingham, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled among our great Engliſh productions. The precepts are ſenſible, the poetry not indifferent, but it has been praiſed more than it deſerves.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>OF all thoſe arts in which the wiſe excel,</l>
            <l>Nature's chief maſter-piece is writing well:</l>
            <l>No writing lifts exalted man ſo high,</l>
            <l>As ſacred and ſoul-moving poeſy:</l>
            <l>No kind of work requires ſo nice a touch;</l>
            <l>And, if well finiſh'd, nothing ſhines ſo much.</l>
            <l>But Heav'n forbid we ſhould be ſo profane,</l>
            <l>To grace the vulgar with that noble name.</l>
            <l>'Tis not a flaſh of fancy, which, ſometimes,</l>
            <l>Dazzling our minds, ſets off the ſlighteſt rhimes;</l>
            <l>Bright as a blaze, but in a moment done:</l>
            <l>True wit is everlaſting, like the ſun,</l>
            <l>Which, tho' ſometimes behind a cloud retir'd,</l>
            <l>Breaks out again, and is by all admir'd.</l>
            <l>Number and rhime, and that harmonious ſound,</l>

            <l>And all in vain theſe ſuperficial parts</l>
            <l>Contribute to the ſtructure of the whole,</l>
            <l>Without a genius too; for that's the ſoul:</l>
            <l>A ſpirit which inſpires the work throughout,</l>
            <l>As that of nature moves the world about;</l>
            <l>A flame that glows amidſt conceptions fit;</l>
            <l>Ev'n ſomething of divine, and more than wit;</l>
            <l>Itſelf unſeen, yet all things by it ſhown,</l>
            <l>Deſcribing all men, but deſcrib'd by none.</l>
            <l>Where doſt thou dwell? What caverns of the brain</l>
            <l>Can ſuch a vaſt and mighty thing contain?</l>
            <l>When I, at vacant hours, in vain thy abſence mourn,</l>
            <l>Oh! where doſt thou retire? and why doſt thou return,</l>
            <l>Sometimes with pow'rful charms to hurry me away,</l>
            <l>From pleaſures of the night, and bus'neſs of the day?</l>
            <l>Ev'n now, too far tranſported, I am fain</l>
            <l>To check thy courſe, and uſe the needful rein.</l>
            <l>As all is dulneſs, when the fancy's bad;</l>
            <l>So, without judgment, fancy is but mad:</l>
            <l>And judgment has a boundleſs influence</l>
            <l>Not only in the choice of words, or ſenſe,</l>
            <l>But on the world, on manners, and on men;</l>
            <l>Fancy is but the feather of the pen;</l>
            <l>Reaſon is that ſubſtantial, uſeful part,</l>
            <l>Which gains the head, while t'other wins the heart.</l>
            <l>Here I ſhall all the various ſorts of verſe,</l>
            <l>And the whole art of poetry rehearſe;</l>
            <l>But who that taſk would after Horace do?</l>
            <l>The beſt of maſters, and examples too!</l>

            <l>'Tis true, the ancients we may rob with eaſe;</l>
            <l>But who with that mean ſhift himſelf can pleaſe,</l>
            <l>Without an actor's pride? A player's art</l>
            <l>Is above his who writes a borrow'd part.</l>
            <l>Yet modern laws are made for later faults,</l>
            <l>And new abſurdities inſpire new thoughts;</l>
            <l>What need has Satire, then, to live on theft,</l>
            <l>When ſo much freſh occaſion ſtill is left?</l>
            <l>Fertile our ſoil, and full of rankeſt weeds,</l>
            <l>And monſters worſe than ever Nilus breeds.</l>
            <l>But hold, the fools ſhall have no cauſe to fear;</l>
            <l>'Tis wit and ſenſe that is the ſubject here:</l>

            <l>Firſt, then, of Songs, which now ſo much abound,</l>
            <l>Without his ſong no fop is to be found;</l>
            <l>A moſt offenſive weapon, which he draws</l>
            <l>On all he meets, againſt Apollo's laws.</l>
            <l>Tho' nothing ſeems more eaſy, yet no part</l>
            <l>Of poetry requires a nicer art;</l>
            <l>For as in rows of richeſt pearl there lies</l>
            <l>Many a blemiſh that eſcape our eyes,</l>

            <l>Here, as in all things elſe, is moſt unfit,</l>
            <l>Bare ribaldry, that poor pretence to wit;</l>
            <l>Such nauſeous ſongs by a late author made,</l>
            <l>Call an unwilling cenſure on his ſhade.</l>
            <l>Not that warm thoughts of the tranſporting joy</l>
            <l>Can ſhock the chaſteſt, or the niceſt cloy;</l>
            <l>But words obſcene, too groſs to move deſire,</l>
            <l>Like heaps of fuel, only choak the fire.</l>
            <l>On other themes he well deſerves our praiſe;</l>
            <l>But palls that appetite he meant to raiſe.</l>
            <l>Next, Elegy, of ſweet, but ſolemn voice,</l>
            <l>And of a ſubject grave, exacts the choice;</l>
            <l>The praiſe of beauty, valour, wit contains;</l>
            <l>And there too oft deſpairing love complains:</l>
            <l>In vain, alas! for who by wit is mov'd?</l>
            <l>That Phoenix-ſhe deſerves to be belov'd;</l>
            <l>But noiſy nonſenſe, and ſuch fops as vex</l>
            <l>Mankind, take moſt with that fantaſtic ſex.</l>
            <l>This to the praiſe of thoſe who better knew;</l>

            <l>Their greateſt fault, who in this kind have writ,</l>

            <l>But ſhould this muſe harmonious numbers yield,</l>
            <l>And ev'ry couplet be with fancy fill'd;</l>
            <l>If yet a juſt coherence be not made</l>
