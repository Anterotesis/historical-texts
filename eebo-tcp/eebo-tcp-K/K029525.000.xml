            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE putrid Sore-Throat has ſo long continued in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, almoſt every year with a new train of ſymptoms, as the celebrated Dr. Fothergill foreſaw, "it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, ſays that great practitioner, in his Account on the Sore-Throat, that this kind of Sore-Throat may continue amongſt us for the future, breaking out with more or leſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, as ſeaſon, ſituation, and
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0412902600:3"/>other circumſtances may concur." And in another place, he ſays, "It may alſo be neceſſary to obſerve, that the diſeaſe is deſcribed as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 1747 and 1748; that if the ſymptoms ſhould hereafter vary in any circumſtance, the diverſity may be attributed to the nature of the diſeaſe, and not imputed to deſign or inattention," a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore of this raging diſeaſe can never be thought uſeleſs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as the ſymptoms ſeem to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in ſome reſpect from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>I am conſcious that an accurate deſcription of diſeaſes, and their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of treatment, requires both great
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0412902600:4"/>abilities and great practice, neither of which I am able to boaſt; but as I have had in this diſeaſe frequent opportunities of making various obſervations, as a great many came under my inſpection, I think it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſumption nor arrogance to lay them along with the hiſtory of the diſeaſes before the Publick; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may excite men of greater ſagacity and practice, to give the world their more preciſe and more learned obſervations, and then I ſhall not think my labour ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or unrewarded.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>BOUT the 15th of July, a Sore-Throat of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant kind, nearly ſuch as deſcribed by Dr. Fothergill, and Dr. Huxham, (only without the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floreſcence, and attended with coſtiveneſs) made its appearance among children from three to ſeven years of age, by which many were cut off in the ſpace of ſix or eight days; ſome by ſuffocation, and others by vomiting of blood: at the ſame time, a complaint of a roughneſs in the throat,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0412902600:7"/>moſt probably ariſing from a deprivation of its mucus, prevailed among adults, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt appearance of ulceration or malignancy, which however in a few days yielded to an external application of the volatile liniment or camphorated oil.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of Auguſt, the ſame Sore-Throat extended its baleful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence more generally, chiefly attacking children from three to ten years of age, and alſo a few adults, of a lax and ill habit of body; in ſome it was very malignant, joined with an eryſipelatoſe inflammation and a diarrhea; the degree of malignancy however ſeemed to have been more adapted to the ſituation than to the conſtitution of the patients, inſomuch that the diſeaſe was very fierce in low, marſhy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and extremely benign in high and open places; thus in <hi>Hampſtead</hi> and <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> it was very ſlight, whereas in <hi>Kentiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town</hi> it raged with great fury, and in <hi>End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field-Chace</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0412902600:8"/>it ſwept away many in the ſpace of twenty-four hours.</p>
            <p>The diſeaſe was not uniform, but ſeemed to have been of two kinds; in ſome there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only a ſuperficial whiteneſs on the <hi>uvula Tonſils</hi> and <hi>velum palatinum,</hi> whilſt in others thoſe parts were beſet with thick ulcerations, running very deep in the fauces, ſo as to be almoſt inviſible; in both ſpecies however, about the ſecond or third d y, hard ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings appeared externally on each ſide the neck, almoſt meeting together upon the throat, which occaſioned a ſtiffneſs of the neck, laſting in ſome for a month.</p>
            <p>Though the attack of the diſeaſe was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in different perſons, yet moſt of them were taken with a nauſea and ſhiverings, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by heat and an effloreſcence over the breaſt and extremities, and often the whole body was of a crimſon red; ſome were ſpread over with a kind of little millets, ſimilar to that in the miliary fever, and which ſcaled off the ſkin the ſixth or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0412902600:9"/>day; in which caſes the ulcerations were very ſlight, as alſo all other ſymptoms of malignancy: in all the different kinds of the effloreſcence, moſt of the patients com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a violent itching, and had a dry and hot ſkin; the pulſe was commonly ſmall, quick, and ſometimes fluttering and unequal; the mouth full of ſloughs, the teeth black and covered with a cruſt; the tongue white, ſometimes a little furred, but frequently beſet with bliſters; the lips parched; the <hi>tonſils</hi> and <hi>uvula</hi> were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo much enlarged, that every thing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be ſwallowed was ejected by the noſe; the urine was commonly diſcharged in ſmall quantities, high coloured, and a thin cloud ſuſpended in its middle; ſome diſcharged a ſmall quantity of blood for a few days out of the noſe; the noſe was ſtuffed up with a greeniſh <hi>ſanies,</hi> which dropped out continually, and ſeemed not to be of an excoriating nature, but rather to occaſion only a ſlight titillation, as a conſtant picking of the noſe was obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0412902600:10"/>in all thoſe caſes. Some were coſtive, whilſt others were afflicted with a ſpecies of an autumnal dyſentry, as their ſtools ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared knotty, ſuch as deſcribed by my ingenious and ſagacious friend, Dr. Wilſon, in his treatiſe on the Autumnal Dyſentry; the purging and effloreſcence however did not ſeem to correſpond with one another; for, firſt, the diſappearance of the one ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom aggravated the other; ſecondly, they were often concomitant; thirdly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a coſtiveneſs attended, though there was not any effloreſcence; nor did the effloreſcence appear to be a critical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, as is the caſe in eruptive diſeaſes of the malignant kind, for the effloreſcence and the Sore-Throat were often met with ſeparately. A cough attended in moſt throughout the whole diſeaſe, probably occaſioned by the irritation of the <hi>larynx;</hi> great depreſſion of ſtrength, dejection of ſpirits, a total inactivity, a delirium, a pulſe that beat 140 or 145 in a minute, and a great diſponae, were fatal omens.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0412902600:11"/>
            <p>It was remarkable that though moſt of the young patients had a great averſion to all manner of food, yet they ſeemed not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to take medicines, which made me imagine that immediate relief was found from it.</p>
            <p>The diſeaſe had neither an apparent criſis, nor any regular progreſs; for all the ſymptoms often vaniſhed of a ſudden about the eighth or ninth day, whilſt at other times they were at a ſtand for about 14 days; but frequently they diminiſhed or increaſed from the 10th to the 14th or 15th day, when either a total recovery was ſeen, excepting the external ſwelling, which laſted often for weeks; or the ſcene of life was cloſed, the patient ſuffocating or expiring in a lingering way. In one caſe only, which I ſhall mention hereafter, I beheld all the malignant ſymptoms in the higheſt degree, the patient labouring under them for three weeks, and at laſt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0412902600:12"/>
            <p>An oedematous ſwelling, after the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the fatal ſymptoms, and when nothing but an entire recovery was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, appeared to be very frequent in children of an ill habit of body; the lips, noſe and face were bloated, ſallow, ſhining, and greaſy, as it were, which ſwelling ſpread itſelf ſometimes over one ſide, and at others over the whole body, eſpecially the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; the ſwelling I have obſerved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe always in the morning, and to abate towards evening. Dr. Huxham, in his diſſertation on the Malignant Ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sore-Throat, has obſerved the ſame; but only "before the fatal period," not after a total recovery; nor does he take notice of that particular circumſtance concerning its increaſe and abatement, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from all other dropſical ſwellings: however, ſome have been carried off by it a month after the firſt invaſion of the diſeaſe, whilſt many recovered by the uſe of proper cathartics and full doſes of the bark.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0412902600:13"/>
            <p>This diſeaſe was ſometimes miſtaken for the meaſles, not only becauſe the cough being an idiopatic ſymptom of the ſame, but becauſe the effloreſcence in the benign kind was ſo very ſimilar to thoſe of the meaſles, and which were alſo epidemical the latter end of Auguſt: great miſchief would have been done in treating it according to the miſtake, with expectorants, opiates, and antiphlogiſtics; but the very aſpect of the throat, even in the benign kind, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſwellings, and the cough itſelf ſo different from that of the meaſles, where it is much ſtronger and deeper, if I am allowed this expreſſion, could ſoon detect the error; though I had often occaſion to think that ſome patients were attacked with both diſeaſes at once, and then I have treated them accordingly.</p>
            <p>If we conſider that in this epidemic the effloreſcence appeared often indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the <hi>angina,</hi> and was ſimilar to the miliary or ſcarlet fever, that further, no
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0412902600:14"/>great connexion has been obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>diarrhoea</hi> and the effloreſcence, and the diſappearance of the latter did not always aggravate the former; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that often a conſtipation accompanied the whole diſeaſe, notwithſtanding the abſence of the effloreſcence; again, that both the angina and the eryſepelatoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation often appeared ſeparately, and that the ſtools were ſimilar to thoſe of the autumnal dyſentry; I ſay, conſidering all theſe circumſtances, it ſeems as if the effloreſcence were not always a critical diſcharge, as is the caſe in moſt putrid diſeaſes of the puſtular kind; but that the genuine and principal diſeaſe was the epidemic Sore-Throat, which began early in ſummer, and conſequently, to ſpeak in the language of Sydenham, was either an early autumnal, or a late vernal epidemic, to which in autumn two other epidemics, namely, either the ſcarlet or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary fever, and a purging, like the autumnal dyſentry were joined; the firſt, and genuine
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0412902600:15"/>epidemic, namely, the Sore-Throat, being at the ſame time predominant, as often obſerved by the great Sydenham; and though that great obſerver attributed epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics to the occult, and not to the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities of the air, yet latter obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers favour the contrary opinion, as it appears from the writings of Dr. <hi>Shaw, Arbuthnot</hi> on Air, Dr. <hi>Hale</hi>'s Statical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, Dr. Huxham <hi>de aere et morb. epid.</hi> and others; and it is very probable, that the preſent aroſe from the frequent ſhowers and ſtormy winds, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greateſt part of June and July, though often with eaſterly winds, yet the ſun piercing through the clouds in the intervals of the ſhowers might have much contributed to the epidemic in queſtion, warning the floating vapours, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a change in the conſtitution of the air, which, when bred in, has in adults, only affected the mucus membrane of the Throat, and occaſioned there a roughneſs; whereas in child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en, and thoſe of a lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0412902600:16"/>it has introduced its malignancy deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and brought on putrid ulceration; the ſultry and warm autumn then approaching has rouſed again, as it were, the lurking epidemic, which then ſpread itſelf more general, and more malignant joined with two autumnal epidemics: theſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are only probable conjectures, which I ſhall quit, and return to the method of treating the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>As the principal diſeaſe was of the malignant kind, antiſceptics, the king of which the bark may juſtly be called, were the firſt indications, a vomit has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cut the diſeaſe ſhort, and which, in the firſt onſet of the diſeaſe, ought never to be omitted, as it rouſes the nervous ſyſtem, and the principles of life, the energy of which it ſo much depends upon in the removal of putrid diſeaſes; and as it clears the ſtomach of its crudities; for the powers of digeſtion are always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in putrid attacks, eſpecially in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0412902600:17"/>preſent caſe, where moſt probably the <hi>oeſophagus,</hi> and perhaps the ſtomach itſelf were affected: however, as moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly phyſical aſſiſtance was ſought for ſome days after the invaſion, emetics could not always have been adminiſtered with ſafety, eſpecially when the fauces were much ulcerated. The admiſſion of free and pure air was highly recommended, as many pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents panted for the free air, and which I never found doing any harm, inſomuch that three children afflicted with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe came to me every other day at the Aſylum, which Caſes I ſhall mention here-after. The room in which the patient lay was frequently ſprinkled with vinegar; a gargle, or rather an injection in the Throat, was adminiſtered of a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the bark and the tincture of myrrh, with which alſo the mouth was continually waſhed: internally, the bark was given, ſometimes with the ſpirit of minderery, and at others with the cardiac confection, according to the degree of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0412902600:18"/>fever. The camphorated oil, or the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile leniment, was applied to diſperſe the external ſwellings; for as they ſeemed to be of a malignant nature, it was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable to invite, by poulticing them, more humours thither, for fear of converting a greater quantity of matter into a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant nature, and conſequently increaſing the diſeaſe; nor did bliſters ſeem to have been of any efficacy in either leſſening the degree of the malignancy or the ſize of the ſwellings, though, in compliance with common practice, they were ſometimes ordered, when they occaſioned a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a thick matter, but without the leaſt relief to the patient; bleeding and antiphlogiſtics were ſeldom requiſite; and thoſe who have been treated in the ſtrict cold regimen were only protracted in their miſery. In caſes of coſtiveneſs, I ordered for the patient to eat prunes boiled with ſena and a little of the powder of ginger in it, as they ſerved alſo for nouriſhment, eſpecially as there was an averſion to all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0412902600:19"/>manner of food. Where a purging atten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was moderated by cordials, and often only by the bark, with the addition of the <hi>confect. card.</hi> or a few drops of the <hi>tinct. thebaic.</hi> and which relieved the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient often by bringing on a gentle diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſis, to promote which, plenty of warm and diluting liquors were alſo recommended.</p>
            <p>The oedematous ſwelling, that appeared in many eight days after a total recovery, was beſt removed by repeated doſes of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel and rhubarb, and full doſes of the bark; and as far as I have been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that dreadful ſymptom ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened where proper cathartics were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered after the diſeaſe, to carry off the remainder of the putrid <hi>colluvies,</hi> lodging in the inteſtinal tube.</p>
            <p>As in many caſes the young patients could not be prevailed upon to take medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, a foot, bath of bran, and ſometimes cataplaſms of horſe-radiſh and muſtard were
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0412902600:20"/>ordered with ſucceſs, both in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting by their ſtimulus the energy of the nerves, and in bringing on a revulſion: and indeed, as in Germany ſuch methods are too frequently uſed, ſo are they here too much neglected. That applications to the lower region have a great influence upon the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts of the ſyſtem, is evident from the following ſimple experiment: I felt often a coughing and a <hi>diſpon</hi> coming on ſuddenly, upon holding may feet in cold water, which ſhews the great ſympathy between the nerves of the feet and thoſe of the lung, diaphragm, and of the <hi>trachi,</hi> ſo that cold applied to the feet will irritate the nerves of the lungs, &amp;c. Upon the ſame principle, any ſtimulus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, to the feet will rouſe the nerves of the upper region, and give them energy. Such remote applications muſt even have a better effect than when the ſtimulus is applied immediately to the affected parts, or near them, for it may often bring on alarming ſymptoms, by increaſing the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0412902600:21"/>weakneſs of the already debilitated and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parts, as I have ſeen putrefactions take place where the bliſter was, when applied near the affected part, and which putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made ſo rapid a progreſs, that it was not in the power of art to ſtop it; remote applications therefore, ſuch as cataplaſms and ſemicupiums, are certainly more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary and leſs dangerous: not to mention the inconvenience ariſing from bliſters, when the cantharides are abſorbed in a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem that has a tendency to putrefaction. Even in deliriums, applications to the feet, ſuch as mentioned above, are preferable to either bliſters or opiates, for the former may often increaſe the delirium by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing its cauſe, debility, as obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the latter may aggravate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, by diminiſhing the ſenſibility, and conſequently the energy of the nerves, ſo requiſite to counteract all putrid diaſthaſis. The ſemicupium is frequently uſed in Germany in the beginning of eruptive diſeaſes, eſpecially in the ſmall-pox, where
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0412902600:22"/>it often relieves the nobler parts from their fatal invaſion. Dr. Wilſon aſſured me, that he always ordereth it, and never found any dangerous conſequence of a paralyſes, as has been inſinuated by ſome; but as the diſeaſe in queſtion is ſomewhat ſimilar to the ſmall-pox, might not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micupium be of the ſame uſe?</p>

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0412902600:35"/>
               <p>MY ingenious friend, Dr. Lettſom, whoſe practice is extenſive and obſervations accurate, informed me, that he generally obſerved that a fever, with alternate ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings and hot fits, and a pain and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in ſwallowing, attended the firſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of this diſeaſe; a nauſea, head-ach, reſtleſsneſs, and a ſenſation of general ſoreneſs of the body, and other ſymptoms of fever, were, alſo preſent in greater or leſs degree, even before any ulceration of the <hi>tonſils</hi> took place; its approach how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might be aſcertained by the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe glands, and the livid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and turgeſcence of their veſſels. An effloreſcence of the ſkin moſt general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared at this time, and a fluſhing and bloatedneſs of the face.</p>
               <p>The ulcerations of the <hi>tonſils</hi> uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſlough off about the fourth or fifth day, but a low remittent fever continued frequently for ſome days afterwards, as did
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0412902600:36"/>likewiſe the effloreſcence; and as the fever ceaſed, this gradually vaniſhed, and fell off in bran-like ſcales, and all the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſubſided.</p>
               <p>When the angina was more violent in its attack, the ſloughs were not removed till the ſeventh or eighth day; about which period, when the patient appeared more favourable, conſiderable and unequal ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in one or both ſides of the neck aroſe, and theſe, if not diſcuſſed in two or three days, formed large tedious ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purations, which either diſcharged ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, or behind the <hi>uvula,</hi> or carried off the patient by ſuffocation, or by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; but moſt generally in theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant caſes the ulcerations ſpread infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorly, producing the angina trachaealis, which often proved fatal in grown perſons, as well as in infants. Theſe ulcerations likewiſe extended along the whole, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the mouth and noſtrils; in ſuch inſtances particularly, a delirium almoſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0412902600:37"/>conſtantly ſupervened, and many died in a ſtate of raving, which made him ſuſpect that the eryſipelatous inflammation might extend to the membranes contiguous to the brain.</p>
               <p>The eruption often put on a peculiar appearance in this virulent ſtate of the diſeaſe; inſtead of falling off in ſcales, numerous little ſuppurations might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered upon the ſkin, a little larger than the miliary eruption, and ſometimes as broad as a ſilver penny; they contained purulent matter, which might be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered upon opening them.</p>
               <p>A dyſentery ſometimes preceded the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina, oftener however it came on about the third or fourth day; the diſcharges were dark-coloured, offenſive and thin. Dyſenteries alſo prevailed with angina, particularly in October. While it was requiſite to evacuate theſe foetid congeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the abdomen by mild means; large
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0412902600:38"/>and ſudden evacuations were apt to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the debility.</p>
               <p>Dr. Lettſom alſo obſerved, that the country in the vicinity of London, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much likewiſe, eſpecially in the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, in low marſhy ſituations, wherein the diſeaſe raged through the ſummer, as well as in the ſpring and autumn of 1777, and proved full as fatal as in the metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis.</p>
               <p>When he was conſulted at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the diſeaſe, he generally began the cure by an antimonial emetic, given in ſmall and repeated doſes till it vomited, by which much bilious fluids were diſcharged; and as ſoon as the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was over, he did not heſitate to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the bark, either in decoction or in ſubſtance, although the fever was then conſiderable; it ſeldom appeared to him to increaſe it, or the dyſpnoea which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten attended the angina. Occaſionally,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0412902600:39"/>however, where the fever was very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, he intervened emotic tartar in ſmall doſes as a relaxant, and joined neutralized lemon juice with the cortox: when a diarrhaea was alarming, the confectio car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaca was added, and ſmall doſes of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baic tincture; ſometimes with rhubarb, or ſmall doſes of ipecacoanha inſtead of the emetie tartar; but throughout the whole progreſs of the diſeaſe the bark was ſeldom relinquiſhed. Cordial drinks and acidulated liquors formed a part of the diet. He uſually preſcribed the volatile liniment to the fauces and throat; but where there was danger of ſuffocation, he applied bliſters to the neck. They ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appeared to him to have beneficial effects; but he obſerved, that moſt of thoſe anginas which terminated in tedious glandular ſuppurations of the neck, had been previouſly treated with viſicatories; from whence it was ſuſpected, whether the ſtimulus of the cantharides had not excited this troubleſome and dangerous
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0412902600:40"/>ſymptom, and thereby rather increaſed than leſſened the danger of ſuffocation.</p>
               <p>He ſeldom found the delirium and reſtleſſneſs which accompanied the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina, yielded to an opiate, they were ſometimes increaſed by it, but that pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luvium and fomentations of vinegar and water to the legs produced a more ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary effect; when both were uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the opiate uſually produced a more ſalutary effect.</p>
               <p>Out of ſeveral caſes of glandular ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purations which have occurred to him in practice, he has favoured me with the following caſes and diſſection.</p>
               <p>Mary Pulling, aged nine years, was attacked on the 13th of May, 1777, with rigors and vomiting, which were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by fever, and effloreſcence of the ſkin. I firſt viſited her on the 17th; the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0412902600:41"/>heat was then exceſſive, and the effloreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence general; the pulſe beat about 130 in a minute; a ſlight cough was occaſionally excited, and a delirium now and then prevailed: ſhe complained of a ſoreneſs of the throat, which I found to be ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated.</p>
               <p>Cordial remedies were adminiſtered, with preparations of the bark. Laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were occaſionally preſcribed, and mild opiates when neceſſity required. The volatile liniment was applied to the throat and fauces, and gargles were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed. About the 6th day, a bliſter was applied behind each ear.</p>
               <p>In about ten days time no ſymptoms of the angina appeared; the fever had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, and the effloreſcence of the ſkin had vaniſhed; but the ſtrength was reduced, and the nouriſhment and drinks which the patient ſwallowed were diſcharged by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0412902600:42"/>vomiting; at the ſame time neither a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing nor of ſwallowing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred. Opiates did not ſubdue the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting; mineral acids had no effect, and laxatives did not divert this by opening another diſcharge; and even quickſilve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was ejected. The want of nutrition would augment the debility, to obviate which broth clyſters were recommended; and to take off the determination to the ſtomach, a bliſter was applied to each foot. The vomiting, however, never ſubſided till the 12th of June, when the emaciated pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent expired, without either previous dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pnoea, catarrh, or difficult deglutition.</p>
               <p>On the 13th, the patient was opened by Surgeon Vaux, in the preſence of Dr. Hulme, and other medical gentlemen.</p>
               <p>The brain was found in a perfect ſtate. The inteſtines alſo did not appear diſeaſed; the omentum was almoſt diſſipated; what
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0412902600:43"/>remained of it was flaccid, and not indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. The gall-bladder was conſiderably enlarged. On the leſt ſide of the thorax an effuſion of water appeared, and the left lobe of the lungs afforded a tubercle of conſiderable magnitude. The heart was in a healthy ſtate, and ſo were the liver and ſtomach.</p>
               <p>Upon opening the throat a conſiderable tumor was found on the right ſide, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately behind the <hi>tonſil,</hi> but it had no duct or paſſage into the trachoea; the tumor contained about three ounces of foetid pus in its cavity. The child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſenſible through the diſeaſe, but for the laſt fortnight never complained of any affection near the throat; or that the conſtant inclination to vomit all food or liquids, proceeded from irritation near the part diſeaſed, and deglutition continued fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to the exit of the patient.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0412902600:44"/>
               <p>About the ſame time I was attending another child with very ſimilar ſymptoms of the angina trachoealis; the tumor of the neck was however much larger, and a ſlight dyſpnoea attended the child, which increaſed to ſuch a degree one night as threatened ſuffocation. On the next day the fever and dyſpnoea very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly diminiſhed; and, upon examining the throat internally, I obſerved a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of pus diſcharging from behind the <hi>tonſil</hi> of the ſame ſide of the neck, and this diſcharge was augmented by gently preſſing the tumor externally. The child from this period gradually recovered.</p>
               <p>Suppurations of this kind do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently accompany the angina maligna, or appear during its ſeceſſion, and continue ſometimes feveral days after the mucous membrane, which was firſt affected in the angina, has recovered its natural ſtate. In ſuch inſtances, wherein a fatal tendency
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0412902600:45"/>is ſuſpected, would it not be adviſeable to open the abſceſs that is formed, either by an inciſion through the <hi>tonſil</hi> on the ſide affected, in imitation of the natural operation which occurred in the laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or through the external integu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments where the tumor points externally?</p>

               <head>On the extremes of the cold and hot regimen in the Sore-Throat, and other putrid Diſeaſes.</head>
               <p>SYDENHAM and MORTON practiſed at one time in London; the former introduced the antiphlogiſtic, whilſt the latter continued the alexipharmic, regimen, in the ſmall-pox as well as in different putrid affections; both perhaps with equal grounds and ſucceſs, as the practice of the one was moſtly in the airy and court part of the town, where all diſeaſes are leſs malignant, and where the air is purer than it is in the cloſe part of the town, the city, full of gaols and impure air in which the other reſided. An obſervation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me by Dr. Fothergill, who inſiſts even now upon the hot regimen in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0412902600:47"/>the malignant Sore-Throat, and has aſſured me that notwithſtanding, in compliance with other phyſicians, he often tried the bark, yet never found it to anſwer the deſired effect and was obliged to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe again to his method of treating it with cordials, &amp;c. He obſerved further, that even animal food ſeemed not to be ſo hurtful in this diſeaſe as is commonly thought; for he has taken notice that the patients have a particular longing for it, a call of unerring nature for ſupport and ſtrength, and the Doctor thinks that acids are not ſo beneficial, and ſo great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſceptics, as is imagined: all which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks are certainly not theoretical, but founded on the ſolid baſis of a long and great practice and repeated obſervations; other practitioners however, inſiſt much upon the bark, and ſome even upon the antiphlogiſtic regimen.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0412902600:48"/>
               <p>It is true, that the indications of cure, according to the ſtate of the patient, his ſituation, and the degree of malignancy of the diſeaſe and its ſymptoms, and not this or that regimen ought to be the guide of the artiſt. It is alſo undeniable, that even nature which is ſo much talked of, cannot always be conſulted as the true guide; for if we were to encourage na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all her endeavours, ſhe would lead us often aſtray. In many eryſipelous caſes, and cutaneous eruptions, where nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to throw out ſome peccant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the ſkin, experience has thought not to aſſiſt her by ſudorifics and warm medicines, but on the contrary to uſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartics. In the putrid Sore-Throat, and the confluent ſmall-pox, the diarrhea often attending, muſt be checked and moderated; and ſo in many caſes where nature muſt be oppoſed, as ſhe often acts not upon wiſe, but upon mechanical principles,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0412902600:49"/>and it is the buſineſs of the phyſician to watch her only, and to let experience be his guide, in encouraging, moderating, and counteracting her efforts; it is only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore practice and not theory that enables the artiſt to diſtinguiſh between the criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and ſymptomatical appearances of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. But when practitioners differ ſo widely, even thoſe who practiſe in one and the ſame part of the town, and all appeal to facts, then I ſhould think, theory might have ſome right to interfere, and bring in its verdict. I know that I am far from being equal to the taſk; nor do I propoſe to decide in ſo important and intricate a ſubject, but mean only to throw out ſome thoughts, and vehemently wiſh that the ſubject might be handled by my ſuperiors both in knowledge and practice.</p>
               <p>The antiphlogiſtic regimen, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent ſmall-pox eſpecially, is hot ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0412902600:50"/>as it is commonly thought. The Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian phyſicians have already recommended the free and cold air,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Primus eſt cum nimium tecti et coöperti aegri ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantur, et in Lipothymiam incidunt, tunc aeri frigido, vento etiam paulatim tamen, aegri exponendi.

C. 47.—234.</note> Sydenham has only renewed and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it more generally, which regimen, as it was at firſt ſo much oppoſed, ſo has it afterwards been too much embraced and extended to too great a length, as we are commonly apt to run to either of the extremes, eſpecially when we are actuated
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0412902600:51"/>by the evil ſpirits of novelty and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>Though there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the nature of the confluent ſmall-pox and the diſeaſe in queſtion, as the latter conſiſts chiefly in the conſtitution of the air, evidenced by its attacking the <hi>fauces,</hi> whereas the former lies dormant and lurking, as it were, in the ſyſtem and the whole maſs of blood, obvious from the nature of inoculation; yet are they in ſo far ſimilar, as all putrid diſeaſes, or thoſe which appear with great depreſſion of ſtrength, are related to one another, and therefore what holds of the one, is <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> applicable to the other, as in both, the view of the phyſician muſt be directed in ſupporting the ſtrength of his patient, and in avoiding every application that may in the leaſt tend to increaſe the general debility. Either of the extremes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0412902600:52"/>will often increaſe the diſeaſe; for to confine the patient to his bed, heat his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with wine and cordials, and debar him of the air, muſt certainly rarify the blood, relax the fibres, and increaſe the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to putrefaction, by increaſing its too great principles, <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>moiſture;</hi> as on the other hand, the too cold regimen will greatly contribute to leſſen the energy and motion of the ſolids as well as of the fluids; and indeed many young and tender patients have periſhed by cold, and been frozen to death, as it were, though others have often recovered under the coldeſt regimen, yet this will prove no more than, that nature often cures diſeaſes in ſpite of all miſmanagement of art.</p>
               <p>Bleeding can ſeldom be proper, for the ſpontaneous naſal hoemorrhage, in the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of both diſeaſes, the putrid Sore-Throat and the confluent ſmall-pox, does not ſeem
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0412902600:53"/>to be a hint of nature, inſinuating the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of emptying the veſſels; but I ſhould imagine its being merely ſymptomatical, owing to the looſe texture of the blood, as is evident in caſes of great malignancy, where the blood when drawn from a vein is ſo watery and putrid, that it does not coagulate as uſual, and might be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and moved any way with the ſlighteſt touch of a feather, like water: the air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the blood encreaſes its elaſticity is ſet looſe by the heat and fermentation of the fluids, and expands itſelf to ſuch a degree, that it compaſſes a much greater room than uſual, by which means it ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the fibres, and forces them to dilate beyond their natural dimenſions, which, in the ſmaller capillary veins, occaſions their burſting, and conſequently hoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhages that are only ſymptomatical and indicate antiſceptics, bracers, and free air, not bleeding; though the Arabian Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0412902600:54"/>have conſidered ſuch diſcharges as critical, and accordingly recommended the opening of the veins of the noſe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſmall-pox.<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Et cum erit conveniens flebotomare venas narum i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The ſame obſervation holds of the diarr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haea, often attending the ſmall-pox, as well as the putrid Sore-Throat, which is ſymptomatical, owing to the weakneſs and irritable ſtate of the inteſtinal tube, and to the ſtimuli of the juices corrupted by the diſeaſe, but is not a critical diſcharge, and therefore muſt be moderated.</p>
               <p>In all putrid diſeaſes, the principle of life and the nerves are chiefly concerned, inſomuch, that Aſtrue thought, from examining the brains of thoſe who died in putrid fevers, that the ſeat of the diſorder lies originally in the brain itſelf; but if
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0412902600:55"/>even that alteration found he in the brain was only (as it moſt probably ſeemed to be) the effect and not the cauſe of the diſeaſe, yet has no phyſician ever diſputed that all putrid diſorders impart much to the eneaphlon and the nervous ſyſtem, as is evident from the anxiety, dejection of ſpirits, and proſtration of ſtrength attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very onſet of putrid diſeaſes, clearly painted upon the eyes, and languiſhing and pityful countenance of the patient, and which, by itſelf, is ſufficient for a good obſerver, to give him an exact idea of the diſeaſe and its degree of malignancy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining the ſtate of the pulſe, and inquiring into all other ſymptoms. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the nerves are primary or ſecondary affected it matters not, the indications of cure, <hi>coeteris paribus,</hi> remain notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, namely, to excite and rouſe the motion and energy of the nerves, and to brace the whole ſyſtem, which may be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0412902600:56"/>done either by applications acting with their ſtimulating quality, ſuch as cordials, ſpirits, and bliſters, or by adminiſtering ſuch as are able to corroborate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, as it were, the looſe and relaxed fibres, as are all the bitters, the bark, cold air, &amp;c. Either of which applications however are not attended without ſome diſadvantages; for what concerns cordials and ſtimuli, it is well known, that although they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully rouſe the ſpirits, yet that great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of the nerves is only a temporary tumult, as it were, which ſoon ceaſes, and leaves commonly behind it a great langour and relaxation of the fibres; as on the other hand ſtrengtheners and bitters alone, without the junction of ſome ſtimuli to exert the fibres into motion and action, will ſometimes have no effect at all, and often do great miſchief; for I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where<note n="(d)" place="bottom">See the Author's Eſſay on the Blood.</note> endeavoured to ſhew, that all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0412902600:57"/>medicines and application to living bodies can act only in degree and proportion to the reaction of the living fibres, and as long as the fibres are too weak to react, the effects of corroborating medicines will be juſt, to make uſe of a familiar ſimile, as a heap of coals thrown upon a little fire, which, inſtead of making it burn briſker, will extinguiſh it entirely.</p>
               <p>The immediate effects of the bark, when given to patients, whoſe lungs are affected, in bringing on an inſupportable dyſpnoea, is a plain proof that it diminiſhes the irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fibres, and which I have ſeen often reſtored by adminiſtering what are called expectorants and ſtimuli, eſpecially a ſolution of gum ammoniac, with the ſal. c. c. Seeing therefore, that there is ſome difficulty attending in each of the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and regimens ſeparately, the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional method, I ſhould imagine, would be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0412902600:58"/>to hit upon the medium of both regimens, and to join the bark along with ſtimulants and cordials, by which means, both inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be anſwered at once, namely, that of rouſing the fibres, and exerting them to react, when at the ſame time they are coroborated and ſtrengthened by the bark; practice convinces the truth of this theory. That the bark doth often not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the expectations of the phyſician, is moſt probably owing to, either of its not being properly guarded with ſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and warm medicines, or, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is too often the caſe, to its not been given in full doſes, and not being perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in, though it muſt be allowed, that whenever an anginal dyſpnoea is at hand, that the bark cannot be adminiſtered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bringing on alarming ſymptoms. But might it not often ſucceed when joined with balſamics and aromatics?</p>
