            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>THE Firſt Edition of this Work was ſo ill Printed, and by Reaſon of the Author's Abſence from the Preſs was ſo uncorrect, that it ſtood more than ordinarily in Need of the Help of a good Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; yet it is hoped the Work has not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour'd the Reverend Perſon, who did it the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give it the firſt Recommendation.</p>
            <p>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of the Subject, and the Honesty of the Deſign, has prevailed to give it a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the World: And notwithſtanding the Caſual Imperfections of the Firſt Part, ſome good Men have been pleaſed to accept the Performance, to uſher it into the World much to its Advantage, and to recommend it as well from the Pulpit as from the Preſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1046700601:3"/>
The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy Author earneſtly deſir'd, and to his utmoſt endeavour'd to be for ever conceal'd; not that he was aſham'd of the Work, or ſees any Reaſon yet to be ſo; profeſſing to have a firm Belief, that he was not without a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Preſence and Aſſiſtance of the Divine Spirit in the Performance. But being fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Proſpect of doing Good by it: He deſir'd his <hi>Praiſe might not be of Men, but of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this End he took ſuch Meaſures at firſt for effectually preſerving the Secret, and for his entire remaining in the Obſcurity he deſir'd, that for ſome time after the Publication he continued ungueſs'd at, and he flatter'd himſelf for a while, that the Author would be no farther enquired into: <hi>But Satan hindred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Succeſs of the Work, and the many Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies given to the good Effect it has had in Families, notwithſtanding their Knowledge of the Author, has fully deliver'd him from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement he was under on that Occaſion; and this alone has prevail'd with him for a Second Edition, which he had for ſometime reſolv'd againſt; it was not without Reaſon that he had great Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, leaſt ſome Men ſuffering their Prejudices to prevail even over their Zeal for publick Good, might be tempted to lay the Imperfections of the Author of this Book, as a ſtumbling Block in the way of thoſe who might otherwiſe receive Benefit by it, and ſo the good Effect of his Labour might be in Part obſtructed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1046700601:4"/>
But God, who as before, he firmly believes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his Hand in the Work, has given his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Bleſſing to it; and has thereby from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven own'd the Author to his inexpreſſible Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Joy. <hi>To his Name be all the Praiſe!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AFTER THIS, Let who will reject him or his Book, it is not poſſible to give him the leaſt Diſturbance.</p>
            <p>AFTER THIS, if any Man will rob him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or any one elſe, of the Good this Work might otherwiſe do, <hi>at his Door be the Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Preſent Edition is more carefully corrected, and the Errors of the Preſs are ſo few, and of ſo ſmall Conſequence, that an ordinary Judgment will correct them in the reading.</p>
            <p>The Author in reviſing it has made no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, thinking his firſt Deſign fully exhauſted, and alſo eſteeming it injurious to thoſe, who have bought the firſt, to make a Second Edition vary ſo much from it, as to make them think their Money loſt, and to oblige them to buy it over again.</p>
            <p>Some few Things are omitted indeed, but not conſiderable, and thoſe principally in the <hi>Notes;</hi> from the meer Senſe the Author had of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's being leſs beautiful than the Text; and that others are able to make better Annotations than himſelf.</p>
            <p>The whole Work being deſign'd both to divert and inſtruct, the Author has endeavoured to adapt it as much as poſſible to both thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes, from whence ſome have call'd it <hi>a Religious Play.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1046700601:5"/>
It would more have anſwer'd that Title, had the Author's firſt Deſign been purſued, which was to have made it a Drammatick Poem: But the Subject was too ſolemn, and the Text too copious, to ſuffer the Reſtraint on one Hand, or the Excurſions on the other, which the Decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Poem would have made neceſſary.</p>
            <p>As to its being called <hi>a Play, be it called ſo if they pleaſe;</hi> it muſt be confeſt, ſome Parts of it are too much acted in many Families a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us: The Author wiſhes that either all <hi>our Plays</hi> were as uſeful for the Improvement and Entertainment of the World, or that <hi>they were</hi> leſs encouraged.</p>
            <p>The ſame Reaſons which obliged the Author to conceal his Name at the firſt Publication, prevails with him to forbear it now; ſo that tho' he neither declines owning the Work, or being known by his Name, yet referring it to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he leaves the Diſcovery to go no farther than others think fit to carry it.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1046700601:7"/>
It is not the Deſign of this Undertaking to give a Liſt of Authorities in Scripture for Catechiſing and Inſtructing of Children, or the Commendations and Teſtimonies given there to thoſe that did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Children in the Knowledge and Practice of Religion: That eminent Text is ſufficient to this, being the bleſſed Character given to <hi>Abraham</hi> from God himſelf, <hi>I know</hi> Abraham, ſays the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18 19. <hi>that he will Command his Children and his Houſhold after him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But we live in an Age that does not want ſo much to know their Duty <hi>as to practiſe it;</hi> not ſo much <hi>to be taught,</hi> as to be made obedient to what they have <hi>already learnt;</hi> and therefore I ſhall take up no Time in proving this Matter to be a Duty, there's hardly a Wretch ſo hardned but will readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it.</p>
               <p>But we are, I ſay, arrived at a Time in which Men will frankly own a thing to be their Duty which <hi>at the ſame time</hi> they dare omit the Practice of; and innumerable Arts, Shifts and Turns they find out to make that omiſſion eaſie to themſelves, and excuſable to others.</p>
               <p>One Part of this Work is pointed <hi>at ſuch;</hi> if poſſible, to make them bluſh at their unacountable Raſhneſs, and to ſhame them out of ſuch a fordid inconſiſtent Courſe as that of living in the allow'd Omiſſion of what they acknowledge to be their Duty.</p>
               <p>The way I have taken for this, is <hi>entirely New,</hi> and at firſt <hi>perhaps</hi> it may appear ſomething <hi>Odd,</hi> and the Method may be contemned; But let ſuch blame their own more irregular Tempers, that muſt have every thing turned into new Models; muſt be touch'd with <hi>Novelty,</hi> and have their Fancies humour'd <hi>with the Dreſs</hi> of a thing; ſo that if it be what has been ſaid over and over a thouſand
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1046700601:8"/>
times, yet if it has but a different colour'd Coat, or a new Feather in its Cap, it pleaſes and wins upon them, whereas the ſame Truths written in the divineſt Stile in the World, would be flat, ſtale and unpleaſant without it.</p>
               <p>If then, after all the pains which have been taken by miniſterial Labour and Inſtruction, and by the preſſing Exhortations and moving Arguments of eminent Divines, even of all Opinions, in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings on this Subject, this mean and familiar Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſhould by its Novelty prevail, this will be a happy Undertaking, but no Reproach at all to the Labours of others.</p>
               <p>In the purſuit of this Book care is taken to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Diſtinctions of Opinion, as to Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> and no Offence can be taken here either on the one Side or the other; as I hope <hi>both</hi> are Chriſtians, ſo <hi>both</hi> are treated here as ſuch, and the Advice is impartially directed <hi>to both</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>If thoſe who call themſelves Chriſtians and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, will not inſtruct their Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, here they will find their Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants inſtructing them; and reproving them too; and both they and their Children may here meet with Inſtructions together.</p>
               <p>The Father repreſented here, appears knowing enough, but ſeems to be one of thoſe profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who acknowledging God in their Mouths, <hi>yet take no effectual Care</hi> to honour him with their Practice; that live in a Round of Religion, as a thing of courſe; have not the Power of Godlineſs, nor much of the Form; a kind of a Negative Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, <hi>a God-I-thank thee Phariſee,</hi> found in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but negligent in Converſation; Orthodox in Opinion, but Hetrodox in Practice; and that I have found out ſuch a Perſon, is to ſignify, that let

him be <hi>where</hi> he will, and <hi>who</hi> he will, this Work is calculated to reprove and admoniſh him.</p>
               <p>The Mother here repreſented, is likewiſe a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal looſe-living Chriſtian, a Proteſtant Profeſſor of Religion without the Practice of it; <hi>but yet</hi> ſhe is a <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> one that knows how to talk of Religion, and makes a ſhow to belong to it, but—alas for the reſt! the Conſequence will appear in the Book; in which I doubt a great many may ſee their own Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture drawn: May the Sight of it have the ſame healing, convincing Efficacy, as appears upon the Perſons here, whoſe Story is therefore brought for an Example to them.</p>
               <p>May they ſee it <hi>and bluſh; like the Father here mention'd:</hi> Like him may they <hi>be aſham'd of their Likeneſs:</hi> May they ſee it, <hi>and</hi> like him <hi>effectually reform the dreadful Practiſe:</hi> This would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly anſwer the End and Deſign of the Author of this Book, and rejoice the Hearts of all ſerious Chriſtians in the Nation.</p>
               <p>The Child who is here made the Inquirer. has <hi>no Queſtions</hi> put into its Mouth but what are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Rational; conſiſtent with Principle, and as near as could be are ſuch as are proper even to a Child; none but what the Author wiſhes every body would put ſeriouſly to themſelves as often as they look about them in the World, and none but what even a Child is capable to enquire into. The Author has endeavour'd to produce the Queſtions with <hi>an Air of meer Nature,</hi> Innocence and Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; <hi>yet ſuch</hi> as being naturally adapted to the general State of things may be appoſit and direct: <hi>Such as</hi> being the meer product of the moſt common Reaſonings, and even of the Underſtanding of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, a Child's Underſtanding may juſtly be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have propoſed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1046700601:10"/>
Tho' much of the Story is Hiſtorical, and might be made appear to be true in Fact, yet the Author reſolving not to give the leaſt hint that ſhould lead to Perſons, has been obliged to leave it Uncertain to the Reader, whether it be a Hiſtory or a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; believing it may be either way adapted to the ſincere Deſign: Which is (1.) to reprove thoſe Parents who neglect the Inſtruction of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; And (2.) to direct young Perſons in their firſt Reflections, guiding them to enquire about themſelves, their <hi>Original,</hi> their <hi>State,</hi> their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs</hi> in this World, the reaſon of their <hi>being born into it,</hi> their paſſing <hi>out of it,</hi> and <hi>which is the main Cogitation,</hi> their Condition <hi>beyond it.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The Child is ſuppoſed to be come up to ſuch Years as to be thinking and inquiring, ſuppoſe about five or ſix Years old; and as Nature is always prompting the Soul to be ſearching after ſomething, which it did not know before, ſo that Inquiſitive Temper is <hi>in ſome</hi> ſedater than in others; however, our little Child asks but very little of his Father, but what a Child <hi>at that Age</hi> may be very capable of asking.</p>
               <p>The Scene of this little Action is not laid very remote, or the Circumſtance obſcure; the Father walking in a Field behind his Garden, finds one of his Children wandred out, all alone, under a Row or Walk of Trees, ſitting upon a little riſing Ground, by it ſelf, looking about, and mighty bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, pointing this way, and that way; ſometimes <hi>up,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>down,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>to its ſelf;</hi> ſo that the Father coming unperceived pretty near,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1046700601:11"/>
found the little Creature very buſie <hi>about ſomething</hi> he could not tell what; when the Father, after much Obſervation, and ſome Surpriſe, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing himſelf, asks the Child <hi>What he was doing,</hi> and ſo ſits down by him, which Queſtion begins the FIRST DIALOGUE.</p>

                        <hi>REPENTANCE</hi> Child, is a ſence of, and ſincere ſorrow for Sin in all its Parts; as well Original as Actual; and this Sorrow muſt be always attended with a ſincere Deſire of

                  <p>THE Father, as may be well imagined, warm'd with the various Thoughts that occurr'd to him upon this ſurprizing Diſcourſe, was willing to get the Child away, that he might give Vent to his own Mind; and bringing the Child in, <hi>walks out</hi> again, till he was gotten to a Retirement, and then breaks out in a moſt paſſionate manner upon himſelf, giving full Vent to his Convictions in ſuch a Manner as this:</p>

                  <p>Tears followed the Parent's Speech, and he prays earneſtly to God to forgive him the Neglect and Omiſſion of his Duty to his Children and Family, and enters into a ſecret Engagement between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>his own Soul,</hi> that for the future he will ſet up the due and daily Worſhip of God in his Family, and will diligently and carefully inſtruct his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, teaching them the Knowledge of God, and how to ſerve him, and walk in his Ways.</p>
                  <p>After ſome Compoſure of Mind upon this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, a new Trouble breaks in upon him; he had <hi>elder Children</hi> than this, and he had liv'd in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Neglect of his Duty, either in teaching them the Knowledge of God, or ſhewing them a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Example: Theſe Children had contracted a prophane Habit both in Words, Manners, and conſtant Practice; had little Inclination to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, leſs Knowledge, and <hi>no Thoughts at all</hi> about their Souls, and began to be <hi>too Old,</hi> and <hi>too Big</hi> to be wrought upon by Inſtruction or Perſwaſion, much leſs by Violence and Correction.</p>

                     <hi>Notes</hi> on the Firſt Dialogue.</head>
                  <p>THE obſerving Reader will ſee here, that the Author to obſerve a juſt Equality between all Opinions, and in order to make this work generally uſeful and acceptable to all Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſtians, and to all among them who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly apply themſelves to the great Buſineſs of their Eternal Salvation, has kept himſelf in the Anſwers to this little Child's Enquiry, to the plain general Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he has neither preſcribed himſelf in Method or in Words to the Catechiſms of either the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Aſſembly's Catechiſm, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but laid down the Principles of Religion conſonant to them all, as plainly as he could, as they are deduc'd from the Holy Scriptures, and as they agree with the ſeveral Confeſſions of Faith and Doctrinal Articles as well of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as of all the Proteſtant Churches and Congregations in <hi>Europe,</hi> who profeſs the ſame Faith, believe the ſame God, and hope for Eternal Life thro' Faith in the ſame ever Bleſſed Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>If any particular Chriſtian's Opinion may carry them further, or not ſo far as the Author has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd himſelf here in the Doctrines of Original Sin, Election of Grace, Repentance, and Faith in Chriſt, he prays, that while they can allow what is laid down here to be Orthodox in the Subſtance, they will extend the ſame Charity to his Deſign, as he does to their Opinion, <hi>(viz.),</hi> To leave room for further Explanations, to judge the beſt, and to conſider that as this Part is ſpoken to a Child, and is for Children to read for their Inſtruction, it requires to be plain and conciſe, and <hi>ſo be it</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1046700601:43"/>
that it be eſſentially right; the more adapted it is to the meaneſt Underſtandings, the better it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Deſign of this Undertaking.</p>
                  <p>Some may think the Child here is brought in too often falling upon the Father with a Charge of not inſtructing him, and not praying with him, and not telling him theſe things ſooner; but to ſuch it may be ſufficient to ſay, that as this is one of the great Deſigns of this Work, and is not ſpoken ſo directly to, in any other Part, it requir'd to be more than ordinarily pointed out here; eſpecially becauſe that upon theſe iittle Reprehenſions of this infant, are grounded the ſeveral moſt conſiderable Parts of the Dialogues which follow in the firſt Part: As particularly, the Convictions wrought by it upon the Father, mention'd at the end of the Dialogue, where he is brought in retiring himſelf to give Vent to his Soul, in reflecting on the breach of his Duty, and in Prayer to God; alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring Convictions wrought by the ſame Method, and by the ſame Inſtrument, upon the Mother, as in the ſecond Dialogue, and more eſpecially the Reſolution of both to reform themſelves, and to do their Duties more effectually in their Families.</p>
                  <p>Theſe appearing, as is obſerv'd to be the main Deſign of this firſt Part, and indeed ſomething of this running thro' the whole Courſe of the Work, it could not but be needful to let thoſe little ſharp Reproofs innocently expreſs'd by the little Child in the firſt Dialogue, be often repreated; eſpecially where the Senſe brought them in with a kind of natural, unconſtrain'd Innocence in the Expreſſion, as is generally carefully ordered where-ever thoſe Reproofs are to be met with: Nor indeed could the Expreſſions of the Parents, either in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Ejaculations, or mutual converſing upon that Part one with another, have been conſonant to the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1046700601:44"/>
reſt of the Work, or the cadence of things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, if this had not been laid as a Foundation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Notes are not deſign'd to talk over again the whole Subject of every Diſcourſe, if the Parts deſerve any Comment, every conſidering Chriſtian will make it to themſelves as they go; but where the Caſe is particular, a Word may be ſaid, which in the Dialogues would have been digreſling too long, and have made it tedious.</p>
                  <p>From the Enquiries of the Child may be obſerv'd, how naturally the Connexion of Goſpel-Truths, one with another, appears; I mean thoſe eſſential to our Salvation: How bright a Chain, and how cloſely hanging one upon another, in a Climax that cannot but be admirable to obſerve, is the great Myſtery of Man's Fall and Recovery, Sin entring into the World, Death by Sin, Nature cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Fall, ſanctified by redeeming Grace; <hi>by the Offence of one Man many made Sinners; by the Obedience of one many made Righteous;</hi> Juſtice offended by Sin, eternal Death denounc'd as the Puniſhment; Juſtice ſatisfied by a Redeemer, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life the Conſequence; <hi>No Condemnation to them who are in Chriſt:</hi> Theſe things lie ſo plain, ſo natural, and in ſo exact an Order, that Nature ſeems to direct the Child, who knows nothing of them, to force them from the Father, by the Power of the moſt Innocent uninſtructed Enquiries.</p>
                  <p>How unaccountably to blame are thoſe Parents who let their Children know nothing of theſe things, till their own little, innocent Enquiries ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort it from them!</p>
                  <p>How naturally does the Diſcourſe of this little Child reprove Parents for their Neglect of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Day's Work, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of attending the publick Worſhip of God; and how could the Child but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that going to Church was only a light Matter,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1046700601:45"/>
ſince his Father very ſeldom went himſelf, and ſtay'd at home upon the moſt frivolous Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The Child's Diſcourſe about going to Church only to ſhew his fine Cloaths, and his Mother and Siſter's being chiefly employ'd there, to obſerve the Faſhions and Dreſſes of their Neighbours, with the Converſation they have of thoſe things after they come home, needs no Enlargements here; the Conſciences of moſt young People in our own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies will teach them to apply that Part to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and the Author is content to leave it out, if it is not generally acknowledg'd to be a needful Reproof. The Child is brought in here ſeveral times ſaying to his Father, when he ſpeaks of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, loving, and praying to God, <hi>Do you do ſo, Father?</hi> This puts me in mind of a Story not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to be related: A wicked Boy that had been addicted to Swearing and ill words, was reproved by his Father with more Seriouſneſs than uſual, and his Father toid him, that God heard him: The Father, it ſeems, was a Man of no Religion, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſt of very ill Morals himſelf; but what he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to ſay to the Boy, ſtruck him ſo deeply, that it was a means of Conviction to the Child; but Ignorance having been the Boy's greateſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, when he came to conſider of what his Father had ſaid, he asks one of the Family whether God could ſee as well as hear? when he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, yes, That God was Infinite, and could hear and ſee all things: He told them he could not believe it; <hi>for my Father was drunk laſt Night,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſure he would not have been Drunk if God could ſee him,</hi> elſe <hi>why did he tell me I ſhould not Swear, becauſe God could hear me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Parents knew, or at leaſt conſider'd, the Influence their evil Examples have upon their Children, and how fatal an Encouragement to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1046700601:46"/>
Sin it is to any Children to be able to ſay, <hi>My Father does ſo himſelf,</hi> the Preſence of their Children would be a greater Reſtraint to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Parents, <hi>even in Things in themſelves indifferent, much more in Things really ſinful,</hi> than it is poſſible the Preſence and Awe of the Parent can be to the Children: It is enough that Religious Parents have to ſtruggle with in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and wicked Inclinations of their Children; but they will find, thoſe Liberties their Children take from the Encouragement of their Parents Example, will be ten times more difficult to reſtrain <hi>afterwards,</hi> than thoſe they have from their own Inclination, or the Example of others: It enner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates all the Exhortations of a Father; takes the Edge off from their Reprehenſion; makes their Reſentment ſeem unjuſt and unreaſonable, and makes the Child rather apt to retort the Practice of the Parent upon themſelves, than receive pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently and meekly the Admonition.</p>
                  <p>I humbly recommend this Thought to thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents who indulge themſelves in any Vanities or Exceſſes, ſuch as in Paſſion, in haſty Expreſſions, in Expences, in waſte of Time, in ill Words, in Gaming, nay, or any of thoſe things <hi>which the World are apt to call Lawful and Innocent;</hi> If ſuch things <hi>muſt</hi> be indulg'd, and <hi>you will</hi> allow your ſelves in them, upon a Preſumption that <hi>you</hi> can do them innocently; at leaſt then, conceal them from your Children, leſt what you can uſe with Moderation, they fall into with Exceſs, and juſtify the Practice from your Example.</p>
                  <p>It will be a very uncomfortable Reflection, and will fill the Mind with bitter Reproaches if ever God pleaſes to try ſuch Parents, when they ſhall ſee the Introduction to their Children's Ruin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and begun in their [<hi>the Parents</hi>] Example;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1046700601:47"/>
nor will it be any alleviation to their Sorrow, to ſay, I us'd thoſe Diverſions moderately, and kept my ſelf within Compaſs; it was but very ſeldom that I us'd an ill Word; I play'd at Cards but very moderately, and never for much Money; I ſeldom drank hard, and the like. Our Moderation in Diverſions ſhall introduce our Children's Exceſs; and if the Apoſtle, rather than offend a weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would wholly abſtain even from Part of his neceſſary Suſtenance, <hi>(viz.) eating of Fleſh;</hi> how much more ſhould Parents refrain their Exceſſes, nay, even their lawful Diverſions, rather than lay a Foundation of the Ruin of their Children, and prompt them to Sin, by giving them a Pretence from, or Encouragement by their <hi>Father's</hi> Example.</p>
                  <p>From the whole of this Dialogue, Parents may ſee, beſides their Duty to God, what they owe to their Children, in timely and early inſtructing them; how much inſtructing our Children is a Debt to them; and how unjuſt and injurious we are to our Children in omitting to Inſtruct them. What moving Expreſſions of the Child to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are theſe: <hi>Dear Father,</hi> ſays the Child, <hi>why would you not tell me of it before?</hi> Was you angry with me, Father? And what if it ſhould be too late now! Will not God puniſh me Everlaſtingly now becauſe I have not known this ſooner! How cutting muſt it be to a Parent that has any Senſe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to think that his dear Children ſhould be loſt by his Example, or remain blind by his Omiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and many other Obſervations might be made here from the Particulars of this firſt Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, but it is hop'd the reading the Dialogue its ſelf will cauſe many of them to occur; and the Brevity of this Work admits not our Notes to be too long.</p>

                  <head>Notes on the Second Dialogue.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt obſerve of the Child's being carried to Church, That by the Word Church, or going to Church, in all theſe Dialogues, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Place, and <hi>going to</hi> the Place of publick Worſhip, whether in the Church of <hi>England</hi> People to their Pariſh Churches, or in Diſſenters to their ſeveral Meeting-Houſes, the particular diſtinguiſhing it one way or another being ſtudiouſly avoided here; the Subject, as the Author humbly conceives, being not at all concern'd in our diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Opinions, Sects, or ſeparate Aſſemblies, but equally inſtructing to all who call themſelves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and eſpecially Proteſtant Chriſtians; he believes it would be very much Wrong to lay a Stumbling-block at the Threſhold, and to put any Prejudice in the Minds of the ſerious Readers; which alſo might prevent by Partiality to Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the Benefit which may otherwiſe be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to Chriſtians of all Opinions whatſoever; and this Latitude in his Charity, and in his Deſign of doing Good to all, he hopes none will be offended at.</p>
                  <p>The Father and Mother of this little Child ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear here to be no ignorant Perſons in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Duties of Chriſtianity; but as to the reſt it may be obſerv'd. (1) What a wretched irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1046700601:60"/>
Life ſome of thoſe who have the greateſt Share of Knowledge in Matters of Religion do lead, eſpecially in their Families. (2.) What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret it brings upon their Minds when they are convinc'd of their Wickedneſs in the Neglect of their Families, and when, as in this caſe, much of it may be too late to be retriev'd.</p>
                  <p>(3.) What bitter Reproaches ſuch Children oftentimes caſt back upon their Parents, when they [<hi>the Children</hi>] come to find what they have loſt for want of a godly, religious Education, and early Inſtruction, either good Children or bad.</p>
                  <p>If the Children prove ſober and religious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helps of Inſtruction, <hi>for the Spirit of God is not confin'd or conſtrain'd to theſe outward Helps,</hi> how are they aſham'd of, and a Shame to their Parents! And how muſt the Parents bluſh when they may upon any Occaſion be told, that the Knowledge, the Piety, the Fear of God, which is found in their Children, is no Product of their planting, no Fruit of what they had ſown; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Children of prophane or negligent Parents, are a double Teſtimony to powerful invincible Grace, but a dreadful Reproach to the Parents.</p>
                  <p>This may be a Thought worthy the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Chriſtian Parent, that having neglected the Inſtruction of their Families, and neglected teaching, and praying with, or for their Children, what a juſt Contempt will thoſe Children naturally have for thoſe Parents, eſpecially if ever God comes to enlighten their Hearts, and open their Eyes, <hi>as he ſometimes does without the help of Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inſtruction;</hi> when the Children come to reflect how their Parents totally neglected the Salvation of their Souls, compar'd to which, the Proviſion made for their Bodies was but of little Value, the Diſguſt at the Omiſſion of the former, will be too
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1046700601:61"/>
apt to take off all the Gratitude and Affection due for the latter.</p>
                  <p>Nothing but meer Duty can be ſuppoſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Child's Reſpect, and even common Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to its Parents, when he comes to be ſenſible how unnaturally they abandon'd his Immortal Part; how unchriſtianly they expos'd his better, his intellectual Part, to Eternal Deſtruction, as if the Duty of a Parent had ended, or been reſtrain'd within the narrow Compaſs of the Office of a Nurſe, or a Schoolmaſter; and that they had no Obligation upon them to regard the eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of that Part of their Poſterity which can never die.</p>
                  <p>Such Parents are certainly the moſt unnatural, and may juſtly be reproach'd by their Children, not with neglect of their Duty <hi>only,</hi> but with their being without Natural Affections, and conſequently can by no means expect ſuitable returns of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from their Children, when they come to be made ſenſible of the Treatment they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from them; if they ſhow them common Reſpect, <hi>as above,</hi> it muſt be all owing to that very Grace, which in ſpight of the Obſtructions of a Godleſs Education, has been planted in the Heart by the powerful Influence, and invincible Operation of the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>For Parents to pretend Love to their Children, and Natural Affection, as they are the Fruit of their Bodies, and <hi>(as is vulgarly expreſs'd)</hi> their own Fleſh and Blood, and at the ſame time neglect to inſtruct them, or educate them either in human Learning, or religious Knowledge, is juſt as if, when their Children are taken ſick, they ſhould employ themſelves in mending or making them Cloaths, or dreſſing up fine Banquets or Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for them, and wholly omit the neceſſary
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1046700601:62"/>
Cordials or Applications for the Recovery of their Health; <hi>only with this difference,</hi> that the Soul to the Body has infinitely a greater Diſproportion than the Health, and the daily Food.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But our Caſe extends yet farther,</hi> viz. That the Defect complain'd of here, is not the want of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation and Inſtruction, from the Ignorance or Incapacity of the Parent; for this had been the Hand of God immediately in bringing forth the Child from Parents that knew not God; but <hi>the Caſe here</hi> is yet more aggravated, in that <hi>this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens</hi> in Families where the Parents have the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and have the Capacity, and know, and acknowledge it to be their Duty to inſtruct their Children, and yet entirely neglect it, which adds to the Crime in the Parent, and will be ground of Aſtoniſhment and Reflection in the Children, <hi>if they ever come to the Knowledge of God without the due Aſſiſtance</hi> of their Parents. Nor will the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of the Parents be leſs bitter on themſelves than thoſe of their Children, as will be more lively repreſented in the other Dialogues of this Part.</p>
                  <p>But this Subject may alſo be of preſent Uſe to Children who have not the Bleſſing of Godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to inſtruct them, and for this it is alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd; and theſe as well as thoſe whoſe Parents neglect the great Duty of inſtructing them, are deſir'd to conſider from the Example of this little Child theſe few things.</p>

                  <p>WHat a great deal of Work have thoſe People behind-hand, who do not begin to inſtruct and reſtrain their Children till they are too big for Correction! <hi>Folly that is bound up in the Heart of a Child, ſays</hi> Solomon, is driven <hi>thence by the Rod of Correction:</hi> But when it remains in the Child, and neither the <hi>Rod</hi> of Correction, or the <hi>Voice</hi> of Inſtruction is made uſe of <hi>to drive it out,</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:1046700601:73"/>
till the Child grows up to be a Man, it is very hard, nay impoſſible, <hi>but by a ſupernatural Aſſiſtance,</hi> to drive it out at all. <hi>What this Folly is,</hi> needs no Deſcription here, other than an allow'd Cuſtom in doing Evil, a natural Propenſity we all have to Evil; with this we are all born into the World, the Soul is originally bent to <hi>Folly;</hi> this Bent or Inclination muſt be rectified, <hi>or driven out</hi> either by <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> or if that proves inſufficient, by <hi>Correction;</hi> and it is to be done while the Perſon is <hi>young,</hi> while he is a <hi>Child,</hi> and then <hi>IT MAY</hi> be done. The Child <hi>may</hi> be wrought upon; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture like ſome Vegetables, is malleable when ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>green</hi> and <hi>early;</hi> but hard and brittle when condens'd by Time and Age; <hi>at firſt</hi> it bows and bends to Inſtruction and Reproof, but afterwards obſtinately refuſes both.</p>
                  <p>The Temper of a Child miſled by Vice or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, <hi>like a diſlocated Bone,</hi> is eaſie to be reduc'd into its Place, <hi>if taken in time;</hi> but if ſuffer'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remain in its diſlocated Poſition, a callous Subſtance fills up <hi>the empty Space,</hi> and by neglect grows e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually hard with the Bone, and reſiſting the Power of the Surgeon's Skill, renders <hi>the Reduction</hi> of the Joynt impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>The Heart of the tender Youth, by forbearance of Inſtruction, grows opinionated, and obſtinately embraces the Follies he has been indulg'd in, not being eaſily convinc'd of the criminal Quality of what he has been ſo long allow'd the Practice of <hi>by his negligent Parents;</hi> and this renders late Inſtruction fruitleſs: <hi>THEN as to Correction,</hi> the Heart being hardned, as before, by Opinion and Practice, and eſpecially in a Belief that he <hi>ought not to be corrected,</hi> the Rod of Correction has a different Effect; for as <hi>the Blow</hi> of a Stripe makes an Impreſſion on the Heart of a Child, as ſtamping
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1046700601:74"/>
a Seal does upon the ſoft Wax, the Reproof even of Words on the ſame Heart when grown up, and made hard, is like ſtriking upon Steel, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making an Impreſſion <hi>on the Metal,</hi> darts back ſparks of Fire in your Face.</p>
                  <p>As this whole Work is chiefly deſign'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Parents of the Neceſſity of beginning early the great Work of inſtructing and managing their Children, ſo <hi>two things</hi> will run more viſibly thro' every Part of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) <hi>For their Encouragement,</hi> the Examples of the eaſineſs and advantages of early Inſtruction will be ſeen: How ſoft! how pliable the Minds of little Children are! how like Wax they lie, ready to be moulded into any Form, and receive any Impreſſion, that the diligent Application of Parents thinks fit to make upon them! From whence alſo Parents <hi>are warned</hi> to be very careful, that by their Example or Negligence, thoſe firſt ſoftned Circumſtances of their Childrens Minds <hi>are not paſs'd over</hi> without ſuitable Applications, to forming them a right, filling them with Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Knowledge, and with juſt Principles, both religious and moral; <hi>above all,</hi> that they receive no bad Impreſſions from the Practice of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whoſe Example, <hi>eſpecially in Evil,</hi> takes ſuch deep Root in their Children, that nothing is more difficult to remove.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) <hi>For Warning, and ſerious Caution,</hi> by letting them ſee the dreadful Effects of the neglecting their Children when young; what Work it makes for Repentance in both; what breaches it makes in Families, when Neceſſity drives them to begin that Work late; what Treatment they are like to meet with from their Children; how theſe will think it hard to be inſtructed when grown up; count it impoſing upon them in their Parents, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

the Arguments their Parents ſhall uſe; deſpiſe and contemn their Reproof; think themſelves paſt Correction, and turn their Backs not only upon all the Methods their Parents ſhall take with them, but even upon their Parents themſelves, when they attempt by Government and Diſcipline to retrieve the Error they have committed.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>laſt Dialogue</hi> the Husband and Wife ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſenſible of their Miſtake this way, and the Difficulties they have before them in retrieving it, <hi>juſtly appear terrible,</hi> almoſt drive them to deſpair of the Succeſs, and to give over any Thoughts of the Attempt; in the ſubſequent Parts of this Work we ſhall find they were not miſtaken in the Proſpect they had of the Difficulty before them, or of the Obſtinacy and Oppoſition which they ſhould meet with from their Children.</p>
                  <p>As to their being <hi>ſo diſcourag'd</hi> as not to make the Attempt, the Husband argues wiſely, that it is not leſs their Duty for its having been delay'd; that it muſt be ſet about, let the Difficulty be what it will; and that therefore <hi>he is reſolv'd</hi> to attempt it, and if poſſible, to go thro' it, leaving the Succeſs to God.</p>
                  <p>This is a wiſe and Chriſtian Reſolution, and argues that the Convictions the Parent was under, were ſanctified by the Spirit of God, and carried on to effectual Converſion; <hi>for</hi> all Conviction of Sin that do not go on to Reformation and effectual Application to our Duty, are ineffectual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions; <hi>like waking in a Dream,</hi> while the Heart is aſleep, when ſlumbering on, we fall into the ſame Dream again.</p>
                  <p>For the encouraging Parents to purſue theſe Convictions, and to hope for ſome ſucceſs in their Work, tho' begun late, and under ſome weighty Diſcouragements, <hi>the following Part of this Work</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1046700601:76"/>
                     <hi>will ſhew</hi> how far he met with Succeſs in his Family Reformation and Inſtruction, as well as what Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction he met with from his Eldeſt Children, for all were not alike obſtinate and refractory as the Eldeſt were; and the Mother was but too true a Propheteſs of the Conſequence from their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the Diſcourſe between the Husband and Wife</hi> under their Convictions, may be ſeen ſomething of the Duty of ſuch Relations.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) To communicate to one another their Griefs, and moſt inward Afflictions of Mind, as well as their common Diſaſters and Troubles of the World: This is one Part of the Duty of Husband and Wife to one another, <hi>tho' underſtood by few,</hi> meant and included in that Phraſe, <hi>AN HELP-MEET;</hi> and it is obſervable, that when ſuch near Relations do affectionately communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to one another their Souls Concerns <hi>in ſuch a manner as I ſpeak of now,</hi> God is often pleas'd ſo variouſly to act in the Minds of ſuch by his Spirit, that they ſhall in their Turns be mutually able to aſſiſt, comfort, direct, and counſel one another: This, <hi>if it were well obſerv'd,</hi> would be very uſeful and encouraging to Chriſtian Relations in their moſt ſerious and reſerv'd Reflections; where they might take notice how that Party that is diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd and dejected <hi>to Day,</hi> and receives Support and Encouragements, Relief and Direction from the Counſel and comforting Aſſiſtance <hi>of the other,</hi> ſhall be reſtor'd and comforted, and perhaps enabled <hi>the next time</hi> to give the ſame Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Counſel, Advice and Comfort to the other, who may in like manner be ſunk under his own Fears and Temptations!</p>
                  <p>This I thought fit to recommend in the moſt earneſt Terms, and from juſt Experience, to the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1046700601:77"/>
Conſideration of Chriſtian Relations, as a uſeful Obſervation, <hi>in hope</hi> it may be improv'd by the Experience of others, to the Glory of God, and their own Comfort.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) The Duty of Parents <hi>may be ſeen here,</hi> as it reſpects the Neceſſity of ſetting about the great Work of Family-Reformation, <hi>however late,</hi> and whatever the Diſcouragements may be: <hi>The Father here</hi> expreſſes this affectionately to his Wife, <hi>Our Children,</hi> ſays he, <hi>may be ſtill loſt,</hi> notwithſtanding our Endeavour; but we are ſure to be loſt if we continue to neglect it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From theſe Conſiderations</hi> the Father reſolves to ſet about the Work, and immediately gives his Wife an Account of the Method he propoſes to himſelf to go upon; in which Method, like a prudent Man, and good Chriſtian, he propoſes a ſerious mutual Humiliation <hi>to his Wife</hi> for their former neglect of their Duty, and a fervent praying to God for his Bleſſing upon their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in their Family-Reformation.</p>
                  <p>Hence is intimated, and ſeriouſly recommended to Parents and Heads of Families, the great Work which is ſo much neglected, or rather ſo little regarded, of a Family joining in Confeſſion of thoſe Sins, <hi>I mean of Husband and Wife,</hi> which they have joined in the committing; would Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Wives join ſeriouſly in humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together before God, for thoſe Family-Sins which they have join'd in the guilt of, Family-Reformation would be ſet about with much more Earneſtneſs and Application <hi>than now</hi> we ſee it is, and many Obſtructions to it, which happen by our Willingneſs to excuſe our ſelves, would be removed.</p>
                  <p>From the manner of the Husband and Wife's Diſcourſe here, <hi>may be noted,</hi> That where <hi>thorough</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:1046700601:78"/>
                     <hi>Conviction</hi> works in the Mind, both Parties are, <hi>as it is here,</hi> forwardeſt to accuſe themſelves; whereas in moſt Family-caſes the Heads of Families ſeem always forward to ſhift off the Fault from themſelves, tho' <hi>they acknowledge</hi> the Error, ſee plainly the defect, and the Conſequences of it alſo in the Ruin of their Children; yet they are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, <hi>like Adam and Eve,</hi> in throwing the Guilt of it off from themſelves, either upon one another, or upon Accidents and Circumſtances, which they think may ſerve <hi>to excuſe themſelves;</hi> but if they were thoroughly touch'd with the thing it ſelf, with the Guilt of it upon themſelves, and the fatal Conſequences of it upon their Children, they would mutually own the firſt, and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the laſt, as our two Penitent Parents do here. <hi>Oh! I have ruin'd all my Children,</hi> ſays the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>No, no, you have not ruin'd them, It is I have ruin'd them,</hi> ſays the Father; <hi>I have negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted my Duty to them,</hi> ſays the Father. <hi>But I have been the Cauſe of your neglecting your Duty,</hi> ſays the Mother.</p>
                  <p>Here is a compleat View for Parents, both of the Error, the Repentance, and the Reformation, the Diſeaſe, the Effects of it, and the manner of the Cure; and as theſe are the Foundation of what follows, ſo the following Dialogues are an Exemplification of moſt of the things contain'd in theſe Diſcourſes of the two Parents, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of them will be taken notice of throughout the whole Work.</p>

               <p>FOR the better underſtanding this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it is to be underſtood, that the Father and Mother, according to their Reſolution in the laſt Dialogue, <hi>had ſet effectually</hi> about the Reformation of their Family, and about proper Methods for reducing their Children to an Obedience <hi>to,</hi> and Sence <hi>of</hi> their Duty.</p>
               <p>Their Children were moſt of them grown up, and had run a great length, they had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd in all poſſible Folly and Levity, ſuch as <hi>Plays, Gaming, Looſeneſs</hi> of Life, and <hi>Irreligious</hi> Behaviour; not immodeſt or diſhoneſt, That they were not yet arrived to; but they were bred up with <hi>Gayety</hi> and <hi>Gallantry,</hi> as being of good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and Faſhion; but nothing of Religion, more than juſt the common courſe of going to Church, which they did becauſe it was the Cuſtom and Faſhion, rather than with any other View; and being thus unhappily Educated, we ſhall find the Inſtruction they were now to bear, met with the more Oppoſition in them, and we ſhall ſee how it had a various Effect according to the different Temper and Conſtitution of the Children.</p>

Their eldeſt Daughter was about eighteen Years old, and her Mother, it ſeems, began with her firſt: Her Mother found it a very difficult matter to deal with her; for when ſhe came to tell her of laying by her fooliſh Romances and Novels, <hi>of which ſhe was mighty fond;</hi> leaving off her Patches and Play-Books; refuſing her going to the Park on the Sabbath-Days, <hi>and the like,</hi> ſhe flew out in a Paſſion, and told her Mother, <hi>in plain words,</hi> ſhe would not be hinder'd; ſhe was paſt a Child, ſhe would go to the Park, and to the Play, <hi>and the like,</hi> ay that ſhe would.</p>

                  <p>I was going to tell you <hi>the ſhort Hiſtory of it,</hi> if you would have Patience: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Early this Morning, <hi>before we went to Church,</hi> my Father call'd me up into his Chamber, and after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſeveral things of me <hi>about</hi> my Learning, my Company, and my Behaviour in the World, to which I made as good an Anſwer as I could, <hi>he told me,</hi> with a great deal of Tenderneſs, <hi>that</hi> he lov'd me very dearly; <hi>that</hi> he intended to do very well for me, <hi>that</hi> he had a particular Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for me; and <hi>that-</hi>he had but one thing he deſir'd of me, and that this was for my own Good too, and deſir'd to know if I was diſpoſed to comply with him: I told him, <hi>I was very willing to do any thing to oblige him, who had been ſo good a Father to me.</hi> He told me, all he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd of me, <hi>was this;</hi> He had obſerv'd that his Family in general was running on into all kind of Levity and Looſneſs; which he was ſatisfied, would be their Ruin; <hi>That</hi> he had been remiſs in his Duty of Inſtruction, and Reproof to his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1046700601:88"/>
Children, but that he begg'd God Pardon for that Omiſſion, and would do his beſt to make us all amends: He concluded with asking me, whether I had rather <hi>be a Rake,</hi> or a <hi>Sober Man:</hi> I anſwer'd, I hop'd he did not expect any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from me to that, and that I hop'd I had not gone ſo far as to make him doubt in the leaſt that I did not deſign to be a Sober Man. <hi>Why, Son,</hi> replies my Father, you have no other way to do this, but to conclude, that if there were <hi>no</hi> Divine Law, <hi>no</hi> Future State, <hi>no</hi> Rewards or Puniſhments; yet, regarding the Honour and Character which you expect in the World, you ought to be Sober, if it were only to preſerve your Reputation: <hi>He told me,</hi> that I knew he had deſign'd me for the Practice of the Law; that tho' he would do what he could for me, yet, as he had a great many other Children, I muſt expect to live, <hi>or at leaſt to advance my ſelf</hi> by my own Merit and Induſtry; and that a Lawyer, like a Virgin, having once loſt the Reputation of his Virtue or Sobriety, no body will meddle with him.<p>"I not only liſtned very attentively to my Father's Diſcourſe, but looking ſteadily upon him, I thought I ſaw more than uſual Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Affection in him all the while he was ſpeaking; <hi>whenever</hi> he mention'd his having omitted his Duty to his Family, I thought I ſaw Tears ſtanding in his Eyes, and to hear him ſay, he begg'd God's Pardon for the neglect of it, <hi>brought Tears into mine;</hi> when he told me he would make us all amends for the future, it ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to my Mind, that my Father ſuppoſed that this want of more early inſtructing us, <hi>who are his Children,</hi> was <hi>our Loſs</hi> as well as <hi>his Fault,</hi> and that we were not ſuch Children as we ſhould

have been <hi>if we had been better taught.</hi> I muſt own to you, <hi>Siſter,</hi> theſe Thoughts have ſince made a great Diſturbance in my Mind; I thought I ſaw the Two young Ladies at next Door, and their Brother too, look'd quite another Sort of People <hi>than we did;</hi> they appear <hi>ſo</hi> modeſt, <hi>ſo</hi> ſober, and yet <hi>ſo</hi> decently and genteely affable and pleaſant, that I think they live quite another Lite than we do: <hi>They never</hi> ſwear, nor uſe lewd and prophane Words in their Diſcourſe; <hi>they never</hi> ſit up all Night at Cards, or go a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting a <hi>Sundays,</hi> nor do a hundred fooliſh things that our Family makes a Trade of, <hi>and yet</hi> they live as merrily, comfortably, ſociably, and genteely as we do.</p>
                        <p>"<hi>I muſt own to you,</hi> tho' I have often laugh'd at them, and ridicul'd them before, yet my Thoughts often told me they liv'd a more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life than we did; and when I heard my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talk thus, it preſently came into my Thoughts, That if my Father took the new Courſe with his Family <hi>as he talk'd of,</hi> we ſhould begin to be like them, and I thought that would be very well for us all.</p>
                        <p>"Well, after my Father had gone on thus, and paus'd a while, <hi>I ſuppoſe to hear whether I would ſay any thing to it or no;</hi> I told him, I would be glad to do any thing to anſwer his End, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know what it was he expected of me: <hi>My Father ſaid,</hi> The chief End of his Diſcourſe was then to convince me of the Reaſonableneſs and Neceſſity of an Alteration in my Life, and of the Advantages of a Religious Family, and of a ſober, religious Education, and for the reſt, if I was firſt ſatisfied of the general, he knew it would be eaſie to bring me to comply with all the Meaſures he ſhould take to bring it about.</p>

We had a great deal more ſuch Diſcourſe, but I told him I was very well ſatisfied that he deſign'd nothing but our Good, and I ſhould be ready to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the Injunctions he ſhould lay on me; and <hi>truly Siſter,</hi> now I begin to reflect upon it, I find a great deal of Satisfaction in it; <hi>for, upon my Word,</hi> I think we have liv'd very odly all along, whether it were my Father's Fault or our own, I don't enquire; but if we knew no more, <hi>none of us;</hi> of the Town, than we do of Religion, we ſhould be a very unfaſhionable Family.</p>

                     <hi>Dear Siſter!</hi> I do not find that my Father or Mother is inclin'd to tax you in particular <hi>any more than all of us,</hi> but all of us together, nay, even our Father and Mother themſelves have been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, godleſs, and graceleſs; and if they now reſolve to repent, and turn, and to carry it after another manner, and to have us do the ſame, <hi>pray what taxing can you call this?</hi> Does not my Father ſay, he confeſſes he has been negligent, and has not done his Duty, <hi>as well as any of us?</hi> And what is all he deſires of us? <hi>But only,</hi> that as he begs Pardon of Almighty God for himſelf, <hi>ſo</hi> we ſhould ask the ſame for our ſelves; <hi>that as</hi> he reſolves to reform the Practice, <hi>ſo we</hi> ſhould do alſo; <hi>that ſo</hi> at laſt we may be a ſober Family, a reform'd Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and may ſerve God for the future after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other manner than we have done; <hi>pray where's the Hardſhip of all this?</hi>

THIS Dialogue needs no Obſervation, ſave on the different Temper between Children dutifully ſubmitting to Family-Government, and affectionately complying with their Parents juſt Deſires; and on the other hand, Children obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhering to the Dictates of their Paſſions; and this will appear to every common Reader; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides much of this <hi>firſt Part</hi> being Hiſtorical, and the Family known, I forbear farther Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on the particular Conduct of the Perſons. The Deſign of this Work being rather to inſtruct other Families, than to reproach thoſe who may think themſelves concern'd: The Author leaves theſe Dialogues therefore without particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, and leaves Room for abler Hands to anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon them hereafter, when the Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd may be gone off the Stage, and then it may rather appear as a general Reproach to thoſe that are guilty, than a patticular Satyr upon Perſons or Families; and this he conceives will alſo tend more to the Uſefulneſs of the Work.</p>

               <p>THE laſt Dialogue is a kind of a <hi>Sketch</hi> or Draught of the whole Family we are ſpeaking of. The Eldeſt <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Daughter,</hi> as their Father and Mother had ſuggeſted, being grown up in a long allow'd Courſe of Looſneſs in Behaviour, all manner of Liberties having been given them; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Family-Reſtraint, <hi>without Government,</hi> and rather encourag'd by their Parents, <hi>than li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi> either by Example or Command, prov'd, <hi>as might well be expected,</hi> very obſtinate and refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>eſpecially the Daughter,</hi> who being hot and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, her Mother, <hi>at the firſt Attempt,</hi> was ſo provok'd as to uſe her ſomewhat roughly; The other Children, who were grown up, <hi>being alſo a Son and a Daughter,</hi> are not only brought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Reformation propoſed by their Parents, but embrace it with Willingneſs and Chearfulneſs, and make their Duty be their Choice, to the great Satisfaction of their Parents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The following Dialogue</hi> is between the Father and Mother with their ſaid <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, <hi>and apart,</hi> which are the ſame that are referred to in the former Diſcourſes.</p>

The Mother, it ſeems began with her Eldeſt Daughter upon ſomething in her Behaviour about breaking the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and this by the Imprudence of the Daughter, ended rougher than ſhe [<hi>the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>] deſign'd it.</p>

               <p>The Mother found the <hi>Second Daughter</hi> ſenſibly affected with her Diſcourſe, and chearfully willing to ſubmit to her Inſtructions, which was a great Comfort to her, and encourag'd her to deal the better with her obſtinate Siſter.</p>
               <p>Their other Children were younger, and rather to be govern'd by Authority than Perſwaſion. The Dialogue with the Eldeſt Daughter <hi>began thus:</hi> After Sermon, every Lord's Day, it had been their Cuſtom to walk abroad, or go to the Park, or a Viſiting, <hi>and ſo to wear off the Evening,</hi> and then come Home to Supper; but the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now alter'd, <hi>the Father</hi> had let the Servants know they muſt all ſtay at Home, and had told his Younger Son, with whom he had diſcourſed in the Morning, that he would have no more going to the Park on the Lord's Day; but the Daughter had not yet heard of it, nor the Eldeſt Son, <hi>or if they had,</hi> they did not believe their Father was in earneſt; ſo that according to their uſual Cuſtom, they were preparing to go abroad, and the <hi>Son</hi> had bid their Coachman get ready to carry them out; the Mother perceiving the Daughter to be putting on her Gloves, calls to her thus:</p>

               <head>The Sixth DIALOGUE.</head>
               <p>WHILE the Mother was <hi>thus</hi> managing her Daughters, the Father was as much engag'd with his <hi>Two Sons,</hi> and his Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips were <hi>every jot</hi> as great as the Mother's, and his Encouragements the ſame too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is to be obſerv'd here,</hi> that the Difficulty in this Part of Education of Children, does not lie ſo much in the Queſtion what to teach them, and <hi>what Principles</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion to go upon, as to bring them by Reaſoning and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be <hi>teachable;</hi> to perſwade them that they have any Occaſion to learn, or that any are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of teaching them, and to cauſe them <hi>to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> to Inſtruction in general.</p>
               <p>The Father call'd his <hi>Second Son</hi> up to him on a Sabbath Day in the Morning, before he came down Stairs, and taking him into his Cloſet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan this Dialogue with him: The Son you are to ſuppoſe had been bred a Gentleman, and a Scholar, was about Seventeen Years of Age, and was newly come from the Univerſity.</p>

                  <p>The firſt Steps, <hi>my dear,</hi> are the breaking off the ill Practices of our Family, and the regulating the Houſe by the Rules of Virtue, Sobriety, and a Chriſtian Life, things we have all been Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to <hi>here.</hi>

                     <hi>This, Sir,</hi> is that which I told you before I had an Inclination to formerly, and 'tis with a great deal of Pleaſure I ſhall cloſe with all your Schemes of that kind; becauſe it is ſome time ago ſince I have ſeen and obſerv'd, that <hi>as I thought</hi> we did not live like Chriſtians, but rather like Heathens; and that other Families were quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Sort of People than we; and I could not but be in love with them, and weary of ours: For <hi>I cannot but think,</hi> that Nature it ſelf dictates <hi>to a Man of Senſe,</hi> that a Life of Virtue and Sobriety is more agreeable to us, <hi>as Men,</hi> than a vicious, wicked, profligate Courſe, which ever, <hi>not only</hi> ruins the Eſtate, the Conſcience, the Health, and the good Name of the Perſon, but even his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>as to the World</hi> alſo.</p>

                  <p>The firſt Hints I had of this kind, Sir, were a great while ago, from ſome accidental, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with <hi>Mr. —</hi> our Neighbour, when we were little Children.</p>

                     <hi>Why,</hi> that is it which gives me the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Concern for you, <hi>Madam,</hi> that when my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had prayed ſo earneſtly and ſo affectionately for your reclaiming and returning to your Duty, <hi>he went on to pray for himſelf,</hi> that he might not be ſuffered to yield to your Obſtinacy; that his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection might not prevail over his Duty; that if God in Judgment had reſolv'd totally to caſt you off, he might be able to do ſo too; and that in the

                  <p>I ſee them both ſo wedded to their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that they think it a moſt intolerable Burden to be abridg'd of them, and I find my Daughter ſullen and melancholly upon it; ſhe tells me, ſhe cannot appear among Company, and ſhe is aſham'd to be ſeen, and deſires me to let her go to her Aunt's, and live with her a while.</p>

               <p>THE Firſt Part having hiſtorically treated of a Father's Conduct with his Houſhold, the Foundation of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to reform his Family, inſtruct his Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I hope it may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſuitable Leſſons to Fathers, Mothers, Maſters of Families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their Duty of Family-Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; as alſo Examples, and ſuitable Hints to Children, to warn them againſt deſpiſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the Inſtruction of their Parents, from the Conſequences on either Side, which appear in the foregoing Hiſtory of this unhappy, yet happy Family.</p>
               <p>The enſuing Part will go the ſame Length in the following Caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) Maſters to Servants. (2) Servants to Maſters, and to Fellow-Servants. (3) Companions and Sociates one to another; from all which may be learnt ſome Leſſons to inſtruct us how to fill up every Relation, every Occaſion, every Circumſtance of Life, and every Converſation, with ſomething uſeful and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting to one another.</p>
               <p>The Scene lies now among the meaner Sort of People, where the Value of a Religious Family, the Extent of its Influence, and the Advantage of good <hi>Family-Government,</hi> as well to thoſe who are
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1046700601:179"/>
out, as to thoſe who are in the Family, may be particularly obſerv'd from the remarkable Conduct of ſome Perſons belonging to Two or Three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in a certain known Country-Corporation at ſome Diſtance from <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE liv'd in a Country Town, an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Trading Man, in middling Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, whoſe Employment being a Clothier, caus'd him to take ſeveral Apprentices, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Journey-men; and who had alſo ſeveral Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his own: He was a Man of an exact up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Converſation, of a moſt devout and religious Behaviour, but more eſpecially in his Family; one that conſtantly maintain'd the Exerciſe of Religious Worſhip in his Houſe, inſtructing and educating his Children and Servants in the Fear and Knowledge of God, with great Care and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, <hi>as well</hi> to their Good, <hi>as</hi> to his own Duty; and this with all poſſible Modeſty and Caution; avoiding all hypocritical Shews and Appearances of Oſtentation, being a ſerious uſeful Chriſtian in every Reſpect, and his Wife was in her Place every way like him.</p>
               <p>There was in the ſame Town a wealthy Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, a Man in great Buſineſs, a Magiſtrate or Alderman of the Corporation, who had likewiſe a large Family of Children and Servants: The Man was bred to buſineſs, drove a great Trade, and grew Rich apace; he was an honeſt ſober Man, had the Reputation of a very fair Dealer, the Credit of what we call a good Man, that would do no body any Wrong; but as to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he made no great Stir about that, he ſerved God <hi>a Sundays</hi> as other People did, and troubled his Head very little with any thing that was Religious all the Week after; indeed, he liv'd in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1046700601:180"/>
a conſtant hurry of Buſineſs, ſo that he had really no time to think of, or to ſpare about Religious Affairs.</p>
               <p>His Children, as they grew up, he put honeſtly to School, enquir'd ſometimes ſuperficially if they were good Boys, and learn'd their Books, and the Maſter as ſuperficially giving an Anſwer that they did pretty well, he was mighty eaſie as to their doing well in the World.</p>
               <p>As to his Servants, it was none of his Care in the leaſt what they did, ſo they minded his Buſineſs; as to Idleneſs, he took pretty good Care to prevent that, by finding them conſtant Employment in his Ware houſes, and about his Buſineſs; and as to either their Morals or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he counted it none of his Buſineſs, except at any time ſome groſs Indecency came in his Way, which oblig'd him to find Fault, and then his Diſpleaſure reſpected the Neglect or Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Buſineſs, or ſome Complaints or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs in the Neighbourhood, rather than any thing of Religion.</p>
               <p>It appears by the Story in hand, that two young Lads, much about the ſame Age, and pretty near the ſame time, came Apprentices to theſe Two Men; The Youths were very different in their Behaviour, tho' otherwiſe agreeable to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their Conduct was, <hi>as in ſuch Caſes it will be,</hi> ſuitable to the Families of their Parents, with whom they had been Educated; <hi>the one</hi> a ſober, well inclin'd, ſerious Lad, that had been brought up by Religious Parents, well inſtructed, and formed early to deſire the beſt things; <hi>the other</hi> a looſe, profligate, prophane Boy, perfectly wild, that had been taught nothing, and deſir'd to learn nothing <hi>but his Trade,</hi> given to ſwearing, lying, and ill Words, but of a good Capacity
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1046700601:181"/>
enough to learn, if he had been taught in time, ſo that he was meerly loſt for want of early In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>The ſober religious Lad was unhappily put Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to the Rich Shop-keeper, who regarded no Religion but his Trade; and the wild pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Boy was put Apprentice to the Religious Tradeſman the Clothier, and being Neighbours, the Boys became acquainted it ſeems: Altho' there was very little Suitableneſs between the manner of the young Men's Education, yet their Age, Neighbourhood, and Opportunity of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concurring, and other Circumſtances per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in their Temper, or in the time of their coming to their Maſters, making them more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to one another than ordinary, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Companions, and contracted an intimate Friendſhip, the Conſequence of which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the following Dialogues.</p>

               <head>The Firſt DIALOGUE.</head>
               <div type="dialogue">
                  <p>AFTER, as is noted, the Two Youths had contracted an Intimacy, ſo that it was grown up to a kind of Affection between them, they agreed in the firſt Place to call Brothers, <hi>and then,</hi> that every Evening when their Shops were ſhut up, and their Buſineſs over, they would ſpend any Time they had to ſpare, always together, either at their Maſters Doors, or walking, or as their Liberty would permit; and, <hi>as may be ſuppoſed to be pretty uſual in ſuch Caſes,</hi> it was not the laſt of the Queſtions they asked one another at theſe Meetings, how they lik'd their Maſters, their Employments, their Uſage, <hi>and the like:</hi> In theſe Diſcourſes it fell out they wanted no Grievances to complain of on both Sides; for that neither of them, tho' they had both gone ſo far as to be bound, lik'd their Circumſtances; but it ſeem'd, that the greateſt of their Diſlike was at their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the reſpective Management of their Families, rather than at any thing in the Trades they carried on, which they otherwiſe lik'd well enough.</p>
                  <p>Says <hi>Will,</hi> who liv'd with the good Clothier, I'll tell you plainly, Brother <hi>Tom,</hi> I am quite
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1046700601:183"/>
tir'd out with my Maſter, I can't imagine what my Father meant when he pick'd out ſuch a Man for me; I'm ſure my Father is none of thoſe kind of People himſelf; Why, our Houſe is a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery inſtead of a Shop, or a Work houſe.</p>
                  <p>A Monaſtery, <hi>Will!</hi> ſays the other, what <hi>do you mean by that?</hi> Don't we hear your People and your Servants about their Buſineſs every Day; they don't dreſs Cloth, and comb Wool in the Monaſteries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why no, Brother,</hi> ſays <hi>Will,</hi> it is not a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery ſo, I don't mean <hi>that,</hi> but we have ſuch a World of Ceremonies, and Religious Doings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, 'tis enough to weary a Body off their Legs; I'm ſure I ſhall never endure it long.</p>

                     <p>Perhaps you are ſooner tired with theſe Religious Doings, Brother, that you ſpeak of, than you would be with other things: Is not that it, Brother <hi>Will?</hi> ſpeak honeſtly.</p>

                     <p>Yes <hi>Brother,</hi> but then you ſay your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter does not call you up till Six, and then he goes to Prayers; now if he did not go to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he would go to work, and you could not expect but to be at Work, who are his Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, as well as the Journey-men; ſo that the Time he ſpends at Prayer, he takes out of your Working Time, and not out of your Sleeping

                     <p>Why, what is your Father? Is he a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or a Chriſtian? Is he a Papiſt or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant?</p>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>My Father a Heathen! No I think not; he is as good a Chriſtian as any of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>

                     <p>Ay! That's ſtrange; I thought there had been no Chriſtians liv'd ſo, <hi>Will:</hi> Is he a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant or a Papiſt?</p>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, a Proteſtant, what ſhould he be do you think; my Father a <hi>Papiſt!</hi> No indeed my Father's as good a Proteſtant as any of you; did not I tell you he went to Church every <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> nay, ſometimes, <hi>eſpecially when it is bad Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> he goes to the Meeting-houſe, becauſe the Church is a good way off.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Will, Will,</hi> I never heard the like, or ſaw the like till I came to my Maſter; I thank God I have never been bred up among ſuch Chriſtians, or among ſuch Proteſtants; I thought there had been no ſuch Proteſtants in the World; nay, there is a Popiſh Family lives next Door to my Father's, and they are conſtantly Morning and Evening, and often at other times of the Day too, at their Worſhip and Prayers, ſerving God in their Way; nay, I have heard, that the <hi>Turks</hi> ſay their Prayers Five Times a Day: Why, it is natural to pray to God, <hi>Will, did not he make us?</hi>
                     </p>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>I can't diſpute, not I; what do you call ſerving God? Is not going to Church ſerving
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1046700601:191"/>
God? I told you my Father went every <hi>Sunday</hi> to Church, I think that's ſerving God, isn't it? And he may ſay his Prayers at home too for ought I know; I ſuppoſe he does not tell Folks when he does that, as my Maſter does, who makes all the Houſe hear of it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But, Brother Will,</hi> thou talk'ſt as if thou had'ſt been bred a Heathen, and not a Proteſtant; Prethee <hi>Will,</hi> did'ſt every read the Bible?</p>

                     <p>Was that all? Did you never read at Home? What, have you never a Bible in the Houſe?</p>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, we have a great Bible in the Parlour Window.</p>

                     <p>What, and does no body uſe it?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, my Mother reads in it ſometimes, and my Father ſets down how old his Children are, in it; there's the Time when we were all Born.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>But were you never us'd to be bid to read in it by your Father or Mother?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, my Mother would ſometimes call me from Play, to come and read my Book; but I would not come, I lov'd my Play too well for that.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>What, would not you come!</p>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>No, not I.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>What, not when your Mother call'd you!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Mother! no, what car'd I for my Mother.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>I never heard the like in my Life; why 'tis a Sign you never read the Bible.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, what if I had?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>Why there you would have read, <hi>Curſed be he that ſets Light by his Father or Mother,</hi> Deut. 27. 16. Beſides, <hi>Will,</hi> cannot you ſay the Ten Commandments?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, I think I can.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, and don't you remember the Fifth Commandment, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother?</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, what's that to my going to Play?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>But it was ſomething to your refuſing to come and read your Book when your Mother call'd you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>What ſignified that? I knew my Mother was not angry, ſhe did not much trouble her Head whether I came in to read or no.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>So indeed it is plain as you ſaid, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Father or your Mother troubled their Heads about you, whether you ſerved God or no! I do not wonder that you think it ſo troubleſome that your Maſter goes to Prayers, and ſerves God in his Family; I wonder how you, that have been bred ſo wickedly, came to be put out to ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious a Family as your Maſter is!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, I heard my Father ſay once, before I came to my Maſter, that he was the willinger to put me to him, becauſe he was a good Man, and I might learn good Things there, for I had never learnt any at home.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>So that your Father owns then, <hi>Will,</hi> that theſe are good Things, tho' he does not practiſe them himſelf, that is very ſtrange, <hi>Will!</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Yes, yes,</hi> My Father us'd to ſay he lov'd my Maſter, becauſe he was a good Man, and that he was a Man kept good Orders in his Family; and one Day he told me, that if I was a good Boy, and follow'd my Maſter's Advice, I ſhould be made a good Man, better than ever my Father was, and that my Maſter went to Prayers, and ſerved God, and ſuch as that, but I knew nothing what he meant; if I had known how it was, I ſhould never have come.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1046700601:193"/>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, you own, that tho' your Father did not call you to Prayer himſelf, he lik'd your Maſter the better becauſe he did, why ſhould not you too.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Not I, I lov'd to live as I had been bred.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>But you ſee your Father own'd that your Maſter was a better Chriſtian than himſelf, and that the Orders he kept in his Family, was the way to make you a good Man, nay, to make you better than your Father too; methinks you ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your Father.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>I don't know as to that, but I don't like it, not I.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>You are then not for being made a good Man, or elſe you don't believe your Father.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>I don't ſee how he'll make me any better than I am; I tell you I don't like it at all, I dare ſay you would not like it neither.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>Would I not! I wiſh I was to be try'd, <hi>Will.</hi>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>I wiſh you were, I am ſure you would be ſick of it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>Why now, Brother <hi>Will,</hi> that cannot be, for my Grievance is juſt the contrary to yours, for I have been the uneaſieſt Boy alive; I have got a Maſter that lives exactly like your Father.</p>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>My Father! Alas my Father is but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Man, your Maſter is an Alderman.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>I mean as to Religion, <hi>Will;</hi> 'tis true, my Maſter goes to the Meeting-houſe, and my Miſtreſs goes to Church, and they ſerve God there after their Way, and we have nothing of Swearing, Curſing, or Drunkenneſs in the Houſe, or ſuch as that, I muſt do them that Juſtice; but as to Religion, I never heard a Word of it in the Houſe ſince I came to it.</p>

                        <hi>Well now,</hi> and yet every body ſays your Maſter is a very good Man.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>That may be.</p>

                     <p>Why then, <hi>Brother,</hi> you ſee you were miſtaken before, when you fancied a Man could not be a good Man without making ſuch a Pother about his Praying and his Religion, as my Maſter does; I do not ſee that my Maſter is a jot better Man than yours.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, <hi>Will,</hi> it was not I was miſtaken, it was your own Father was miſtaken, who you acknowledge, told you, <hi>he loved your Maſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a good Man,</hi> and <hi>that you might learn good Things there, and that if you followed your Maſter's Advice you would be a good Man too, and a better Man than your Father;</hi> he muſt be miſtaken in all that, <hi>Will.</hi>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, but I a'n't talking of my Father, they may be any of them better than my Father, he knows that himſelf; but I ſpeak of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, every Body ſays he is <hi>a good Man,</hi> and <hi>a religious Man,</hi> and he has the beſt Reputation in the Town.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ay, Will,</hi> he is an honeſt Man, a very fair Man, he does no body any Wrong, but I have never been bred that Way in my Life; I have never heard any ſuch thing as Praying to God, or reading the Scriptures in the Houſe ſince I came hither, and yet when I came to him I was told he was a mighty Religious Man.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Why, that's what I ſay,</hi> he is counted a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Man, and they ſay he goes to the <hi>Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes</hi> too.</p>

                     <p>So much the worſe for him if he appear religious only, and his Practice makes him appear to be otherwiſe; however, I will not ſay what he is privately, but this I am ſure of, it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

                     <p>You talk prophanely again, <hi>Will, I am no more for making a Show of Religion than you,</hi> but <hi>if there be no Religion where there is ſome Show of it, to be ſure there is no Religion where there is</hi> no Show <hi>at all of it;</hi> but what do you call <hi>Show?</hi> Is it not every Chriſtian Man's Duty to teach his Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold and Family to ſerve God? Do you call that a Show? Every one ought to make ſuch a Show of Religion, and if he does not, he plainly makes a Show of having very little Religion himſelf: I might give you a great many Places out of Scripture for this, but it ſeems you han't read much out of the Bible.</p>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, what would you have your Maſter do? You would not have him make ſuch a Rout as my Maſter does, would you?</p>

                        <hi>Truly,</hi> I have no manner of Convenience for that neither, for we all lie together in a Room, and at firſt I us'd to kneel down and pray by my ſelf, but the reſt of the Apprentices jeer'd me out of it, and made ſuch a Noiſe at me, I was forc'd to leave it off, and now I go to Bed and riſe like a Beaſt, as they do; but it grieves me ſo, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what to do, for I am ſure it is a Sin to do ſo, and I am afraid God ſhould ſhow ſome Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon me for it.</p>

                     <p>Then you are in a fad Condition, <hi>Will,</hi> and ſo am I too; ſometimes I think it will break my Heart; I think my Father has put me in the Devil's Mouth, and I am going the ſtrait Road to Hell; I am ſure he does not do ſo himſelf.</p>

                     <p>What could I ſay? I kneel'd down every Night and Morning, and ſaid over the Lord's Prayer, then I got a good Prayer out of a Book, and ſaid that, and ſometimes a Word or two would come into my Thoughts, that I would ſay of my own Head, as I thought of ſuch Things as were proper.</p>

                     <p>Why therefore, <hi>Will,</hi> your firſt thing as, the firſt Thing my Father told me I was to do, was, to pray to God to teach me to know him, and to fear him, and to keep his Commandments.</p>

                     <hi>Notes</hi> on the Firſt Dialogue.</head>
                  <p>THO' this Dialogue, and indeed, this whole Part of the Book, is more a Hiſtory than the reſt, and that the Families which it points at, if they happen to ſee it, may be able to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it, and to make ſome Uſe of it to their own Advantage, if they pleaſe: Yet as even this Hiſtory will be the ſame thing as a Parable to the Ages to come, in which it may, I hope, be as uſeful now; and, <hi>above all,</hi> as this Work is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for a general, not a particular Reproof, I am willing to let it lie hid entirely <hi>as to Perſons,</hi> that it may, perhaps, look leſs by that means like a Hiſtory, than really it is.</p>
                  <p>If the Perſons whom it more really concerns, may ſee themſelves reproved, they will make not the leſs profitable Uſe of it, for the Civility ſhown them in concealing their Names; if they do not
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1046700601:208"/>
the Author can never want Opportunity to expoſe the Folly, <hi>if he ſees Cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Deſign of this Book is of a Nature above a Perſonal Satyr; the Errors in Family-Conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are the Buſineſs here, not the Families themſelves; and the Names and Perſons are ſo entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, and the real Hſtory ſo couch'd, that it is impoſſible for any body, but the Perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to read the People by the Characters.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Thing reproved here, and worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, is a good Man, who had carefully educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and inſtructed his Child, and who <hi>he might eaſily ſee,</hi> was a ſober, well inclin'd <hi>Youth,</hi> knowing in good Things, and deſirous of them; yet had this Religious Parent forgotten himſelf, and ſo far forgotten the Good of his Child alſo, as to place him out with a Maſter who had either no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at all, <hi>or, which was all one to the Child,</hi> exerciſed none of it in his Family; nor took any Care, or had any Concern for the Souls of his Servants, whatever he had for their Bodies.</p>
                  <p>The Child laments this very pathetically, tho' in a familiar way, to his Comrade; he is at firſt weary of the prophane way of living, and then juſtly afraid that the Interruptions he meets with to his Duty, ſhould bring him to an Indifference about it, and to believe the Difficulties he found in his way, were juſt Excuſes for him in omitting it totally at laſt.</p>
                  <p>NOTE, We have natural Hindrances enough in the way of our Duty, from the Averſions of a corrupt Nature, ſo that at the beſt we ſhall be ofren backward in, and prompted to, the Omiſſion of Religious Performances; we have therefore great Need to remove all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1046700601:209"/>
Obſtructions, leſt Natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould plead thoſe Obſtructions as a juſt Reaſon for a total Neglect of Duty.</p>
                  <p>It was not without a juſt Reaſon that the poor Child entertain'd a Jealouſie of himſelf, leſt he ſhould grow cold in Religious Matters, from the general Diſcouragement he met with in a Family where all Religious Duties were totally neglected, and himſelf made a Jeſt for attempting to do his Duty.</p>
                  <p>This may be a ſeaſonable Caution for ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents who have any Concern for the Souls of their Children, and have taken any Pains with them in their Education.<list>
                        <item>1. Not to think their Duty diſcharg'd to them in the due inſtructing and educating them in their Infancy, the Inſpection of a Parent does not end there, but they ought,</item>
                        <item>2. To remember that all that good Seed, which they had ſown, may be choak'd, if the Child comes into bad Hands afterward, and their Son may be loſt by a negligent Maſter, as well as a negligent Parent.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>That therefore,</hi> it is their Duty to take care to place their Children in Religious Families, or it may be true, that they had almoſt as good never have inſtructed them at all.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is very ſtrange, <hi>but too common,</hi> that religious Parents, who have taken great Care with their Children, when they were at home, wholly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect this, and throw their Children away, by placing them where the Duties of Religion are not at all regarded; and where the Examples of their Maſters, and the Families they live in, quite raiſe all the Remembrance of former Inſtruction out of the Mind of the Servant, and they grow hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1046700601:210"/>
in that Neglect by the Authority of their Maſters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is remarkable here farther,</hi> how the Duty of Servants is entirely neglected, even in thoſe Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies where they do regard Religion, and where inſtructing of Children is taken care of; as if the Souls of Servants were not under the Inſpection of the Maſter of a Family, and were none of his Charge, as well as the Souls of his Children.</p>
                  <p>NOTE, Apprentices taken into our Houſes, ought, as far as it reſpects their Souls, to be reckon'd as Children; for as we take them from the Tuition of their Parents, if we act not the Parent to them as well as the Maſter, we may teach them their Trade, but we breed them up for the Devil.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be omitted here to obſerve what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Religion; what Awe of God; what Dread of his Judgments the good Inſtructions of the Father had left on the Mind of this Youth.<list>
                        <item>1. In his Uneaſineſs of being placed in an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Family; <hi>of which afterwards.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. His Averſion to the Diſcourſe of his Comrade, when he talk'd prophanely.</item>
                        <item>3. His terrible Apprehenſions when the other talk'd blaſphemouſly, leſt he ſhould fall down dead, or the Earth ſhould open, and ſwallow him up.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOTE, Tho' 'tis true, that in the ordinary Courſe of Providence God does not deal ſo with thoſe that blaſpheme and provoke him, yet ſince ſometimes God has done ſo, and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, as well as Scripture, is full of dreadful Examples of that kind, it is not without its Uſes, and therefore very commendable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint young Children with ſuch Examples,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1046700601:211"/>
and to fill their Minds with a due Fear of God's Judgments in the like Caſes.</p>
                  <p>Here is Room alſo for a uſeful Remark in the Complaint the poor Child makes, that having no Retirement for performing his Duty by himſelf; when he went about it publickly, the other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants mock'd and jeer'd him out of it.<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>NOTE,</hi> (1.) Tho' ſeparate Conveniences can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always be made for Servants, yet Maſters ſhould, as much as may conſiſt with the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of their Families, be cautious of taking away all manner of Conveniences of Retirement from their Servants, leſt they furniſh them with Excuſes for not doing their Duty.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>NOTE,</hi> (2.) Jeering and mocking a Young-Man for his inclining to be Religious, is too often a Means to drive ſuch quite from it.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>NOTE,</hi> (3.) One of the moſt neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of Youth, is, That he be fortified againſt the ſcandalous Banters and Inſults of his Companions; and can learn to be jeer'd, and yet not be jeer'd out of his Duty.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other Part of this Dialogue affords a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſtance of a Father and Family wholly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Religion, living entirely without God, without Scripture, without ſo much as a Form of Religion: The Effects of this are eſpecially two, and both viſible in the Caſe here laid before us.<list>
                        <item>1. Perfect Ignorance of every thing that look'd like Religion in the Child, not ſo much as the leaſt Senſe of it, or Deſire to know any thing about it remaining.</item>
                        <item>2. Certain and never failing bitter Reproaches of the Child againſt the Parent, when its Eyes come to be opened.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:1046700601:212"/>
                     <hi>NOTE,</hi> Such is the Beauty of a religious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Life in thoſe that practice it, that thoſe who can taſte nothing of it themſelves, yet have a Value for it in others: The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Boy's Father told him, he lov'd his Maſter <hi>becauſe he was a good Man,</hi> and that if he (the Boy) would take his Maſter's Advice, he would make him a better Man than his Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>NOTE,</hi> The Averſions which want of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this Youth had bred in him againſt the Religious Behaviour of his Maſter, and againſt the publick Exerciſes of Religion in his Family, were ſo fooliſhly grounded, that they would bear no weight in his diſcourſing it, <hi>even with a Child;</hi> and therefore the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Youth preſently objects againſt what he ſays, and he himſelf ſooner ſees the Folly of his own Diſcourſe; and yet the Author of this Work is juſt alſo to the Thing it ſelf, for that really our ridiculous Notions in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Religion, will admit no better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to excuſe them.</p>
                  <p>Averſions to Religious Duties grow naturally ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Diſ-uſe of thoſe Duties, or by the Diſaſter of an ill Education, even where the poor hardned Child may think no Harm, or deſign any willful Rebellion againſt God, that Ignorance being the natural Conſequence of want of Inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerve here,</hi> when the wicked Boy being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, asks his Comrade what he muſt do, he goes back to tell him what his own Father uſed to teach him: Whence <hi>note,</hi> that well inſtructing our Children makes them capable to inſtruct others, <hi>as Occaſion preſents,</hi> and conſequently their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they come to have Families of their own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:1046700601:213"/>
From the beginning of the wicked Boy's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, <hi>Note,</hi> that Senſe of Danger is the firſt thing ordinarily that diſcovers it ſelf in Conviction of Sin, and this leads to enquiring after what we are next to do; as the Jailor who firſt came in trembling, then asks, <hi>What muſt I do?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Boy, after his firſt Conviction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects things by himſelf, <hi>while his Companion is gone for the Bible,</hi> he is ſtruck with Horror at his Condition, but the Spirit of God working graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in him, lays the Promiſe of God, <hi>as it were,</hi> full in his way, in order to give him hope, and at the firſt Appearance of hope he breaks out vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently in Prayer; when his Comrade returns, and innocently inquires about what he ſaid, it appears from him, that his Prayer was a kind of Extaſie, mov'd by a ſupernatural Power in his Heart, that affected him in a violent manner, ſo that he hardly could give an Account of it himſelf, but ſays wildly, <hi>he trembled and cried out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are, no doubt, ſuch ſtrong Impreſſions of the Spirit of God accompanying true Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and the great regenerating Work of Grace in the Heart, as may be inexpreſſible, even by the Perſons themſelves, yet far from <hi>Enthuſiaſtick,</hi> or affected, nor are theſe Impreſſions to be ſlighted, much leſs ridicul'd; perhaps this may be in Part ſignified in Regeneration, being called a <hi>New Birth,</hi> tho' the main Intent of that Alluſion be to ſignifie the entire Change of the State.</p>
                  <p>From the whole of this Dialogue may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the great Duty and Advantage of Young Men ſpending the Hours they have to ſpare for Converſation, in Religious Diſcourſes, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of one another about Things relating to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, their Duty here, and their Way thither; this, no doubt, was enjoin'd in the ſame Text
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1046700601:214"/>
where the Inſtruction of our Children is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine Houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the Way: THAT IS,</hi> they ſhall be the general Subject of your Converſation and Communication one with another. <hi>Note,</hi> The Advantages of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Converſation are many, the preſent Caſe is brought to deſcribe them; the young, untaught, uninſtructed Youth, who came out of the Hands of his Parents, to be an Apprentice, as perfectly naked of Knowledge and Inſtruction, as he came naked into the World, becomes a Convert by his keeping Company, and converſing with a religious well inſtructed Companion, and became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an excellent Promoter of Knowledge and Piety in the Place where he lived.</p>

                  <p>THE Young Lad who was put Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the religious Tradeſman above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, tho' he had no Education from his Parents, was, as you have heard in the paſt Dialogue between him and the Youth his Comrade, brought to a Condition quite different-from what he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been brought up in, he had a full Conviction of the deſperate Condition he was in by reaſon of his ſinful Nature and Life: He had receiv'd ſome Light from the little Inſtruction his young, but pious Companion, was capable to give him, and his Conſcience was thoroughly awaken'd; his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Inſtructor had been providentially made the Inſtrument to lay a Foundation of Hope in him, and to encourage him to pray to God, and to read the Scriptures, and to believe that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, would not reject him for his ſinful Life, or for his ſinful Nature, but would grant him <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi> he ſhould ask, and upon this Confidence in his firſt Agony he breaks out, as before, into a ſhort, but vehement Prayer, being the firſt he had ever made in his Life; and which, as it was made from a Heart deeply touch'd with the Danger of his Soul, ſo it left great Impreſſions upon his Mind,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1046700601:216"/>
as I have noted; and having gotten a Bible from his Companion, he goes away with two happy Reſolves, (1) to read, and (2) to pray.</p>
                  <p>The Alteration this made in the Youth, could not be long hid in the Family where he was plac'd, where his wicked way of Living, his prophane Tongue, and his Contempt of Religion, had made him not very well receiv'd, and made his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſo much their Averſion, that the Maſter of the Houſe, and the Miſtreſs too, had warn'd their little Children from converſing with him; and they had had ſome Diſcourſe together about turning him away, finding him of a Temper, as they thought, too refractory to be wrought upon by Advice, paſt the Benefit of Example, and who had ſeveral times made a Jeſt of, and a Scoff at their Attempts to inſtruct him.</p>
                  <p>But the Boy being changed within, <hi>as is noted above,</hi> it could not be that ſuch a Work could long conceal it ſelf in his Converſation; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd penſive, retir'd, and grave in his Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was obſerv'd to <hi>ſigh</hi> very often, and look as if he had been crying; as ſoon as his Buſineſs was over, he was never to be ſeen, but always hid in the Dark, among the Work-houſes, of which his Maſter had ſeveral; he was obſerved to be always ready at the times of Family worſhip, and on the Lord's Day, when his Maſter examin'd him about the Sermons he had heard, they were all ſurpriz'd at him, for the ready Account he gave of what the Miniſter had preached: His Maſter and Miſtreſs, who could not but obſerve this Alteration in the Boy, took the more Notice of him in his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation the Week after, where they found him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent at his Work, more than ever, but nothing of the Mirth and Sport his Fellow Servants uſed to have with him: They obſerv'd he had left off
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1046700601:217"/>
all his ill Words, and wicked Expreſſions, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Curſing, <hi>and the like;</hi> he play'd none, laugh'd none, and hardly was ſeen to ſmile: Several of the Servants and Workmen that obſerv'd it alſo, had been jeſting with him, and ask'd him what ail'd him; but he gave them no Anſwers that were to the purpoſe, ſo that it was hardly gueſs'd at in the Family, at leaſt, not among his Fellows.</p>
                  <p>But his Maſter and Miſtreſs, who from his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, <hi>as above,</hi> had entertain'd ſome Notion of it, or being willing to hope the beſt, had pleas'd themſelves with ſome Thoughts of the Child's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown rather ſerious, than melancholly, made it their Buſineſs to obſerve him more narrowly; and ſeeing him one Evening take a Candle, and go up into a Room over their Work-houſe, by himſelf, the Miſtreſs ſilently followed him, and plac'd her ſelf ſo, as ſhe might ſee him, and he perceived nothing of it.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as he came up he ſet down the Candle, pull'd a Book out of his Pocket, and turn'd over the Leaves, folding up here, and folding down there, but not reading long in any one Place, ſhe obſerv'd him to ſigh grievouſly all the while, and at laſt, to throw down the Book, and burſt out into a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Fit of crying, ſitting down upon the Ground, wringing his Hands, and the Tears running down his Face, but not ſpeaking a Word.</p>
                  <p>While he was in this Agony, ſhe diſcovers her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have ſeen him, and begins thus:</p>
                  <p>WILL, <hi>what's the Matter with you, Child?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Boy ſurpriz'd, ſnatches up the Book haſtily, and puts it in his Pocket.</p>
                  <stage>His Miſtreſs ſpeaks to him again.</stage>

                  <p>THE Impreſſions of the ſerious Diſcourſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the firſt Dialogue that this Young Man had with his Comrade, were ſo great, that they could not be concealed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> A Change wrought in the Heart, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſhew it ſelf in the Converſation.</p>
                  <p>The Maſter and Miſtreſs being good People themſelves, receiv'd Impreſſions of the Alteration in the Boy, ſuitable to the Nature of the thing, but the reſt of the Servants dreamt nothing of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> The Symptoms of Converſion are eaſily diſcovered by thoſe who know the working of the Spirit of God, while they are perfectly inviſible to others.</p>
                  <p>By the Agony the Boy was in at the reading the Comminations of the Scripture againſt Sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the promiſory Part, may be obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>That meer Convictions of Sin drive to Deſpair, but neither direct to, nor enquire after a Remedy.</p>
                  <p>That Comforting Scriptures generally want ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining; terrifying Scriptures explain themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Here may be worth obſerving,<list>
                        <item>1. The Benefit of Religious Converſation, even among young Children, and the great Duty of making our Society inſtructing to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</item>
                        <item>2. The Advantage of placing Children in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Families.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this poor Child had not fallen in ſuch a Family as this, the Temptation he was under to deſpair, might in all Probability have prevail'd over him, and either have led him to give over his Enquiry after Religious Matters or, if God had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1046700601:231"/>
him, have driven him to Extremities, ſuch as Diſtraction, and perhaps, Self-deſtruction, as is often the Conſequence too in like Caſes; for, <hi>a wounded Spirit who can bear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve the poor Child's Fear of its being too late for him to find Mercy, or be accepted.</p>
                  <p>If it might be too late for him, what have they to fear who run on to grey Hairs in an impenitent State! Well might his Miſtreſs obſerve, that <hi>his too late</hi> was ſooner than <hi>her early,</hi> and ſo it is with many.</p>
                  <p>From the good Woman's applying the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to him for Comfort, obſerve how the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are to be read.<list>
                        <item>1. With ſerious ſeeking God for the Aſſiſtance of his Spirit to open our Underſtandings, that we may underſtand the Scriptures; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Teaching, all our Reading will be in vain.</item>
                        <item>2. With a due comparing one Text with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that the Scriptures being their own juſt Expoſitor, may reconcile the Truths of God, as they ought to be underſtood.</item>
                        <item>3. For want of this, we rob our ſelves of the Comfort of the Scriptures; paſs over thoſe Things prepared to heal and reſtore the Soul, and fill our Hearts with diſtracting Doubts about our own State, which are always hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be reſolved and removed, by how much they ſeem confirmed by the miſtaken Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scripture.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve, The good Woman finding the Boy had receiv'd Comfort from that bleſied Promiſe of our Lord; and that he was affectionately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his Reſolution to caſt himſelf at the Foot of Chriſt, crying out, <hi>I will</hi> come to him; and in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1046700601:232"/>
a kind of a Rapture kiſſing the Words which ſhe had ſhewed him, ſhe wiſely withdrew; believing it was a happy Juncture, in which the Child ought to be left alone, that he might give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf full Vent, with Fervency and Earneſtneſs to call upon God; and tho' this cauſes the Dialogue to break off ſooner, and more abruptly than it might have done, yet it is conceived, as much is here ſet down as may anſwer the Deſign of it, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Inſtruction of others.</p>
                  <p>Ending theſe Notes with this Obſervation for the Reader's Information; That as far as this Account is really Hiſtorical, and points at any particular Family, this Boy, or young Man, came to be eminent for Piety, and a Religious Life, in the Place where he liv'd; and being ſettled in that Country, was a very uſeful Inſtrument in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating Chriſtian Knowledge, and ſupporting the Intereſt of true Religion in all the Country round him, and perhaps is living ſtill.</p>

                  <p>THE Young Lad who had been ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily Inſtrumental in the Conviction and Converſion of his Comrade, had thereby render'd himſelf ſo agreeable to the good People, who, as I ſaid before, was Maſter and Miſtreſs of the other Lad, that they could not but be very willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe a little with him themſelves; and to that End cauſed their Apprentice, who called him <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to bring him to their Houſe; where in time, he became very intimate, and they were much pleaſed and diverted with his pretty Diſcourſes, which were always about Religion, and ſerious Things.</p>
                  <p>Among the reſt of his Diſcourſe, he never forgot to bemoan himſelf for his being placed in a Family of no Religious Orders, without the Worſhip of God in it; and where he had neither publick Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſerve God, or private Retirement for the Diſcharge of his Duty.</p>
                  <p>The good People encouraged him to bear it, and ſeriouſly adviſed him not to let the Senſe of his own Duty to wear off, or allow himſelf in the Omiſſion of private Prayer to God, whatever Obſtructions he met with for Want of Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>This he not only gladly accepted, but conſtantly attended, and did it ſo avowedly, not regarding how it might interfere with his Maſter's Hours, and his own Conveniencies, that his Maſter took Offence at his being ſo often out of the way, and not knowing the leaſt of what occaſioned his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, complain'd to his Father of it, as if it had been ſome wicked Courſe he had followed; telling him, <hi>that</hi> his Son did not behave himſelf orderly; <hi>that</hi> he was out of his Buſineſs unſeaſonably; <hi>that</hi> he muſt have ſome bad Haunts, for that he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally went out every Morning very early, (being then Winter) long before Day; and in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings was abſent often at Supper; <hi>that</hi> on the Lord's Day Evening he was never to be found; <hi>and the like;</hi> and therefore deſired his Father to take ſome Care about him, for that if he went on, he would be ruin'd: He farther acquainted his Father, that the Boy had appear'd very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, and diſcontented; that he had ask'd him often if any thing ail'd him, or that he was not well, and he always anſwer'd, <hi>yes;</hi> that he had ask'd him if he did not like his Buſineſs, and ſtill he anſwer'd, <hi>yes, very well;</hi> ſo that he knew not what ail'd him, and deſir'd his Father to talk with him, for if he carried it thus, he could not bear it, but muſt ſend him Home again.</p>

                  <p>Accordingly he finds an Opportunity to talk with the Lad, and lets him know all his Maſter had laid to his Charge, charging him to tell him the Truth of the whole Matter: The Boy, not at all ſurpriz'd, told his Father the whole Caſe very honeſtly; <hi>how that</hi> his Maſter had no ſuch Thing as Family-worſhip in his Houſe, but that they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all like Heathens there; purſuing <hi>the World,</hi> as if it was their Heaven, without the leaſt regard of their Duty to God, or any thing that was reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And you, Sir, <hi>ſays the Boy to his Father,</hi> having always inſtructed me in other Things, and taught me to live after another Manner; it was very uneaſie to me, as I have formerly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you; but I have of late made my ſelf a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eaſie, by getting an Acquaintance in Mr. —'s Family, an honeſt Clothier, who lives over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Houſe, who are very good People, and who conſtantly go to Prayers every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Six a Clock, and every Evening about Eight or Nine; and I get up every Morning to go over there to Prayers with their Family; and every Lord's Day I go thither in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, where the good Man reads to his Family, and examins his Children and Servants, and then prays with them; while, at our Houſe, all the Evening is ſpent in Feaſting, and Viſiting, or idle Diſcourſe, not at all to the Buſineſs of the Day: And this is the whole Caſe.</q>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>About your Son; he and I have had a little Bruſh this Evening.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                     <p>I am ſorry for that; I hope he does not miſ-behave himſelf, or neglect his Buſineſs.</p>

                     <p>I can't ſay much for that; but, as I told you formerly, he has gotten ſome ill Haunts among the Neighbours Servants; and he is out with them every Night and Morning; nay, in the Morning before Day; and every <hi>Sabbath day</hi> after Sermon, I ſee nothing of him at leaſt for that Night; and I can get nothing out of him; but if I talk a little to him, he is for going away, and coming back to you again.</p>

                        <hi>Nay, I have nothing to do with that;</hi> take him to Task about it your ſelf; it is your Buſineſs, <hi>he is your Son, he is none of mine;</hi> you ſaid you would talk with him before.</p>

                        <hi>Ay,</hi> as to Buſineſs, I have the Government of him, indeed; and I am to teach him his Trade, and to ſee that he does my Buſineſs, and ſo I will while he ſtays with me; what can I do farther?</p>

                        <hi>Really, Sir,</hi> If you will pardon me, I think you have the whole Duty and Authority of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent devolv'd upon you, for the Time; and as you make your Apprentices a Part of your Family, all the Duty you owe the reſt of your Family, you owe to them, both as to their Souls and Bodies; except ſuch as relate to Eſtate, which is peculiar to Children; I need not tell you your Duty, but I'll tell you what I underſtood by putting my Child into your Hands, if you pleaſe.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Why,</hi> I underſtood that I put him entirely under your Government, <hi>in the firſt Place;</hi> and under your Care, <hi>in the ſecond;</hi> that this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſpected <hi>firſt</hi> the Authority of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which was to be a perfect <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to mine, even ſo much, that if I had commanded
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1046700601:243"/>
him one thing, and you another that interfer'd with it, his obeying you was not to be counted a diſobeying me: <hi>For Example,</hi> if I commanded him to meet me at any Place or Time, were the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ever ſo great; if you commanded him to ſtay at home, he ought to neglect my Command, and obey yours, which contradicted it, <hi>his Time</hi> being yours, and not mine; and this I always told him, and therefore charg'd him never to come to me without asking you leave.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>This is all very juſt, and I believe he has always done ſo.</p>

                        <hi>Then Sir, Secondly,</hi> as I put him entirely under your Government, ſuſpending my own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over him, <hi>as a Father;</hi> it becomes a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Conſequence of it, that I entirely committed him to your Care, both Soul and Body; how could this be otherwiſe? Since as I reſerv'd no Power to command him, ſo I had of courſe remov'd him from my Inſpection.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>No, not at all, Sir;</hi> for I may indeed take upon me to caution and adviſe him, and ſhew my Diſlike of his Conduct; but the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of warning him, inſtructing him, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, reſtraining him, and, if need be, of correcting him, <hi>is all yours.</hi>

Apprentices <hi>now a days</hi> are not like what they were when you and I were Apprentices; now we get a Hundred Pound, or Two or Three Hundred Pound a Piece with them; they are too high for Reproof and Correction.</p>

                        <hi>I am ſorry for it;</hi> you know beſt, how then you can anſwer to God for the Souls committed to your Charge; do you think every Religious Parent, when he puts his Child Apprentice to you, does not reckon that he commits his Soul to your Care, as well as his Body?</p>

                        <hi>Well,</hi> but that is not enough; your Father and I too, are reſolv'd to find out the Bottom of it, if you will not confeſs ingenuouſly.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, you ſpeak of it, as if I was guilty of ſome ſtrange thing; I hope I have committed no Crime, Sir.</p>

                     <p>It will be very well, if it appears ſo, Sir; however, our Suſpicions are juſtified by your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo very careful to conceal your ſelf; and if this has made me reſolve to examine into it, you might ſave me that Labour, <hi>as I told you,</hi> by an ingenuous Confeſſion.</p>

                  <sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>No! Did I not preſs you to it before, and you declin'd it, and your Father's coming preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or elſe, I ſuppoſe, I had had a flat Denial?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>I never denied to obey any of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Sir,</hi> in my Life; I only told you that I was backward, becauſe I fear'd it might diſpleaſe you; but I little thought it ſhould be ſuggeſted that my being abroad was for any thing criminal.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, your Buſineſs there; the Occaſion of your going ſo early; how you employ'd your ſelf there, and with who? <hi>Theſe are the Queſtions,</hi>

                     <p>You will not take it ill, <hi>Sir,</hi> I hope then, if my Anſwers may ſeem not to become me, or leſs dutiful or reſpectful to you, than you may think they ought to be.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>I hope I ſhall ſatisfie you of that, Sir, by the Conſequence: <hi>You know, Sir,</hi> I have been brought up under my Father, with a Religious Education, and in his Family, where the Worſhip of God has been conſtantly kept up; and coming hither, <hi>Sir,</hi> as an Apprentice, where I found you were not pleas'd to permit me, or to let me come up when you, <hi>I doubt not,</hi> went to Prayers, and reading with your Family; it made me afraid either that you did not think me worthy to be reckon'd one of your Family, or that it was a Judgment of God upon me, to be ſhut out from his Worſhip; this, Sir, made me very ſad, which is the Diſcontent you ſpeak of, but hearing of that other good Family over the Way, and that Mr. —<hi>'s</hi> the Clothier went conſtantly to Prayers every Morning and Night, I got Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Young-man, his Apprentice, and got him to ask his Maſter to give me leave to come there at thoſe Times.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Well Thomas,</hi> this is a well contriv'd Story truly; you want not Cunning I find; but what is this to Six a Clock in the Morning, <hi>Thomas?</hi> which at this time of the Year, is always before Day, and before he is up to be ſure.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>If you pleaſe to enquire, <hi>Sir,</hi> into the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Family, you will find that he is up every Morning in the Year by Six a Clock, and calls them all to Prayers before they go to work.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>And what mean you by getting that Boy to do this for you? That does not hang together at all: <hi>Why,</hi> he is the moſt profligate young Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain that ever came into any good Man's Houſe: His Maſter was talking, in my Hearing, but the other Day, of ſending him to the Houſe of Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſpoke to me for a Warrant; your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with ſuch a Boy as that, is not likely to be for ſo good a Purpoſe; and this Part makes all the reſt unlikely, and to be ſuſpected.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tho.</speaker>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He was ſo,</hi> Sir, that is true; but if you enquire, you will find he is another thing now: God's Grace has made a ſtrange Change in that Boy in a few Weeks paſt; if you pleaſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your ſelf of it, Sir, you may hear it from other Hands.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                     <p>And is this the whole Truth, <hi>Thomas?</hi> Has this been your whole Buſineſs there?</p>

                     <hi>Notes</hi> on the Third Dialogue.</head>
                  <p>THERE ſeems to be more Circumlocutions in this Dialogue, than in any of the reſt; but they will be found not uſeful only but neceſſary at leaſt to preſerve the Cadence of Things, and introduce the Subſtance of the real Story by neceſſary Gradations; the Boy's ſhifting off ſo many Ways, before he directly tells his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the whole of his Buſineſs: Is a Mark of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Modeſty in a Servant; his Shyneſs of ſpeaking what he knew touch'd his Maſter's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour more than his own, may be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing to Servants, if they pleaſe to mark it, in Things where their Maſter's Character may be concern'd: <hi>But above all,</hi> it may be noted, that all theſe Things tend to bring the Conviction home with the more Energy and Force upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Maſter.</p>
                  <p>The Maſter's Diſcourſe with the Young Man's Father contains a great many uſeful Hints about the Duty of Maſters to their Servants. (1.) That they ought to reckon them under their Care as well as under their Government. (2.) That the Charge of the Souls of our Servants lies upon us, as well as thoſe of our Children; the juſt Diſtinction between a PARENT and a FATHER, is fruitful of many uſeful Obſervations, <hi>the laſt</hi> is tied by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>the firſt,</hi> by the God of Nature; <hi>the laſt,</hi> by Affection; <hi>the firſt</hi> by Duty; <hi>but both</hi> are tied to diſcharge the Part of a Chriſtian Parent to the Souls under their Charge, whether Servants, Children, or Relations: That a Servant taken
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1046700601:256"/>
into the Family, becomes a Child of the Family, and ought equally with our Children, to partake of every Part of our Religious Duties; ſuch as Prayer, Exhortation, Examination, Inſtruction, Reproof, Reſtraint, and Correction: This is farther plain, from what God ſays of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Geneſis 18. 19. <hi>That he will command his Children and his Houſhold;</hi> that is, He will diſcharge faithfully the Duty of a Parent, or Guide and Governor of a Family; which is ſhown in his commanding his whole Houſe, to walk in the Ways of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note.</hi> How Cuſtom has wickedly of late years ſeem'd to diſcharge Maſters of this Duty.<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By the Pride of Servants,</hi> who bringing large Sums of Money, much greater than formerly, ſeem to expect not to be ſo much at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as they uſed to be: A wicked and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Cuſtom, which as no Religious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent can be eaſie in it, ſo no Religious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ought to be ſubjected to it.</item>
                        <item>2. By the Negligence of Parents who really ſeem leſs to concern themſelves about the Souls of their Children when they put them out as Apprentices, than about their learning Trades, doing their Buſineſs, <hi>and the like.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. By the univerſal Backwardneſs of Maſters, who think, <hi>as this Man did,</hi> that they have no Concern upon them about their Servants Souls, or any thing but juſt to ſee that their Buſineſs is done, and then to let them go where they pleaſe, and do what they pleaſe.</item>
                        <item>4. Obſerve here a moſt ridiculous Argument or Excuſe, which the Maſter brings, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That he was aſham'd to go about inſtructing
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1046700601:257"/>
or praying with his Apprentices and Journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, becauſe <hi>they would laugh at him!</hi> Note, we are eaſier to be laugh'd OUT OF our Duty than perſwaded INTO IT.</item>

                  <p>I Remember, Neighbour, you were once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of a very bad Servant you had, and talk'd as if you wanted a Warrant of me to ſend him to the Houſe of Correction.</p>

                  <p>Good!

                     <hi>I ſay,</hi> if you are ſatisfied that his coming hither has been as you relate it, and that he has been a means of doing the Young Man ſo much Good, I ſhall be ſatisfied to be ſure; but what need is there of his coming ſo early in a Morning, and ſo late at Night? that indeed I do not underſtand; it ſeems to leave me in the Dark a little, and this makes me ask if you are ſure of the Thing.</p>

                  <p>I will by no means deceive you <hi>Sir,</hi> you do not rightly underſtand us: That our Lad has been inſtructed and brought to a Conviction, and as I believe and hope to a thorough Converſion, by his converſing with the Young Man that is your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>this is true, Sir,</hi> there is no Room to doubt it; but that his coming over hither Night and Morning is to converſe with our Lad <hi>William,</hi>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:1046700601:266"/>
that is not the Caſe at all Sir; I hope the Young Man did not tell you ſo, if he did I ſhould be ſorry; I can hardly ſuſpect him of ſuch a Thing, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he makes more Conſcience of his Words, <hi>than to ſay ſo.</hi>

                  <p>Well, my Wife got it out of him <hi>ſome time after,</hi> when preſſing him to tell her what it was that troubled him, he told her his Caſe was very ſad; his Maſter was a good Man, and he liked his Buſineſs very well, but that his Maſter looked upon him as a Heathen, or as ſome vile Creature, for that Morning and Evening when he went up as he ſuppoſed to Prayers with his Children, he would never let him be called up, or admitted among them; ſo that he ſaid he believed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thought him not worthy taking any care of; or elſe it was a Judgment of GOD upon him for his Sins; and this troubled him ſo, he could not enjoy himſelf, and the poor Child wept grievouſly when he had told it her: <hi>Now Sir,</hi> as this relates to your Family Affairs, I was very unwilling to mention it, leaſt you ſhould be angry.</p>

                  <p>We could not but pity the poor Young Man, and my Wife exhorted him, however to take Care to be the more diligent in his private Duty to GOD, and not to let the want of Family Prayer be a Means to thruſt out Prayer altogether: At this Diſcourſe he wept again more than before, and told her; that he had no Retreat for private Prayer, and that when at firſt he did kneel down
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1046700601:269"/>
by his Bed ſide to pray to GOD, when he went to Bed, the other Apprentices would laugh at him, jeer him, and interrupt him; ſo that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave it off again; that he was afterwards tempted to believe, that having theſe Hinderances he was diſcharged from the Duty, and having no Conveniencies for it, was a juſt Excuſe for omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it; and the Fear that he ſhould grow looſe, and willing to omit his Duty entirely; oppreſt his Mind ſo, that he thought it would break his Heart.

                  <p>I was exceedingly concerned for the Young Man, and ſo was my Wife; and we were both minded to have invited him to come over at our uſual Hours of Family Prayer, and join with us; but as he was your Worſhip's Servant, and we did not know how our Hours might interfere with your Buſineſs, we thought it was not proper, leſt it might give you Offence.</p>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:1046700601:270"/>
not offend his Maſter, by being out at ſuch times as he might be wanted; <hi>withal</hi> telling him that ſhe believed he could not be here at our Morning Prayer, becauſe our Buſineſs requiring us to be early at Work, we went always to Prayer exactly at Six a Clock in the Morning, in Winter, and at Five in Summer: The Poor Young Man was ſo glad of the Liberty, we had given him to come, that he ſaid he would be ſure to be here by Six, or Five if we begin ſo ſoon, tho' he was to ſit up all Night; and indeed we have obſerved, that he has never miſt one Morning yet.</p>

               <head>The Fifth DIALOGUE.</head>
               <p>THE Diſcourſe of the good Man and his Wife had ſuch an Effect upon the Country Alderman, eſpecially with the Addition, from the Account he had received of the Conduct of his Apprentice, that it cauſed him ſeriouſly to reflect on his Family Conduct, and convinc'd him that he had been quite out of the Way of his Duty as a Maſter of his Family to his Servants, as well as in his Relation of a Father to his Children; and theſe Convictions put him upon Reſolutions of altering his Conduct in his Family.</p>
               <p>But here, as in all ſuch Caſes, where a Religious Oeconomy is not eſtabliſhed in the Beginning, inſuperable Difficulties appeared to him; which ſeveral Times diſcouraged him, ſlackned his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and cooled his Mind ſo, as to incline him rather to go on in the Neglect as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, believing it too late to refrain; But two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected providential Accidents ſurprized him into his Duty, the happy Conſequences whereof will appear, for the Encouragement of other Maſters of Families in the like Attempt, of reforming their Practice, and applying themſelves to ſet up a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1046700601:273"/>
Government in their Houſholds, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all pretended Difficulties.</p>
               <p>The Difficulties he had before him were Two; Firſt, he had married a Lady who differed from him in Opinion; he had been bred a Diſſenter from the Church, and his Wife had been bred in Conformity to the Church, and continued ſo: And as this Kind of marrying, however not at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, is not always the greateſt Help to, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of a Religious Family, ſo he (tho' erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly) judged his Wife might not be willing to join with him in his Way of Family Worſhip, if he ſhould begin it: <hi>Again,</hi> as to his Servants, his Apprentices and Journy-men, ſeveral of which he had, were <hi>Men grown,</hi> ſuch as ſeemed to be paſt Government; and as they had none of them any appearing Inclination to what was Religious, he having always indulged them in a total Neglect of ſuch Things, he thought they would but make a Jeſt of him, and that he ſhould never be able to bring them to conform to any Thing of Family Orders. As to his Children, they were Young, and he did not ſo much conſider them in the Caſe; And thoſe that were any Thing grown up were abroad at the Boarding School: Now in both theſe Caſes he was happily diſappointed, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence removed both the Difficulties at once, ſo as to take from him any kind of Excuſe for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Neglect of his Duty.</p>
               <p>It ſoon became known in the Houſe, that <hi>Thomas</hi> and his Maſter had had ſome Words about his going out every Morning and Evening to the Clothiers; nor could it be hid upon what Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he went thither; and his Maſter had ſpoken of it to another of his Servants, that the Young Man ſhould not be hindred, for that he was very well ſatisfied of the Buſineſs he went about. As it
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1046700601:274"/>
was known among the Servants, it could not be concealed from the Miſtreſs, who being a very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religious Lady her ſelf, ſeem'd not a little concerned at the Thing; and having obſerved her Husband to be more than uſually thoughtful and melancholly for ſome Time; She imagined ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about that Apprentice had diſturb'd him; both which Circumſtances put together, occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the following Diſcourſe betwixt them.</p>

                  <p>Or elſe it would be <hi>an Inſult,</hi> not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; no Doubt it is juſt, the Caſe is this, You know, I mentioned to you once before, my Diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction at the Boy's Conduct, and you gave me ſome Hints your ſelf of his being melancholly and diſcontented; upon which, I acquainted his Father with it, but his Father threw it back upon me to examine it my ſelf, and a long Diſpute we had, about whoſe Duty it was to take Cognizance of the Morals and Behaviour of Prentices.</p>

                  <p>Why, I alledged he was his Son, that I could do no more than acquaint him with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and that he muſt take care of the reſt; that my Part was to teach him his Trade, and ſee that my Buſineſs was done, but as to the reſt it lay upon him, and that I had diſcharged my ſelf in giving him this Account of his Son. He affirmed the contrary, that I was in his Place eſſentially, that as I had a Right to his Time, ſo I was obliged to exact an Account of it from him, as much as I would of Money committed to him to pay, <hi>and the like;</hi> and ſo we fell into a long Diſpute about the Diſtinction of a Parent and a Father; he affirmed that I was a Parent to the Boy, tho' not a Father, and that the Duty of taking Care of him both Soul and Body was mine.</p>

                  <p>I am not capable to argue theſe Things; but I confeſs, I muſt be very much of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for I think when a Father commits his Child to us, if he puts his Body under our Care, and not his Soul, pray what muſt become of the Youth? Muſt he be left without Government to be ruined?</p>

                  <p>Indeed, <hi>my Dear,</hi> I have often thought ſo; eſpecially when I have heard you ſay to your Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, that you only required their conſtant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance at ſuch and ſuch Hours, and that for the reſt of the time they might go where they pleas'd: I could not think Young Men ſhould be left ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to their own Diſpoſal, I am perſwaded no ſober Father would like it; I am ſure, if any of my Sons ſhould come to be put out, I ſhould be very ſorry to put them to a Maſter that ſhould do ſo.</p>

                  <p>In ſuch Caſes, there is little Difference betwixt adviſing and teaching, except in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance of the Word; beſides, Advice is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally asked before it is given; if it be given before it be asked, it is rather an Admonition or Reproof than an Advice.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wife.</speaker>
                  <p>If you will have it be ſo that I muſt give my Opinion; I muſt be very plain, that I think you have a great deal more to do; that when they are committed to your Charge by their Parents, their whole Behaviour is under your Care; and that tho' ſerving God is their particular Duty, and lies upon them, yet it is your Duty to ſee, <hi>as far as in you lies,</hi> that they perform it; and at your Hands their Souls will be required, if you neglect <hi>your Duty,</hi> and indulge them in the Neglect <hi>of their own.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Husb.</speaker>
                  <p>But <hi>my Dear,</hi> you muſt explain the words <hi>as far as in me lies,</hi> that is the Thing I ſpeak of; my Buſineſs is their Work, if they neglect that, I am to ſee it remedied; but as to their Morals and Religion, if I ſee Cauſe to diſlike, I acquaint their Parents; is not that doing the Thing as far as in me lies?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wife.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot ſay <hi>that it is;</hi> you may do much more than that, or elſe what does that ſignifie? For when a Father knows of his Son's wicked Courſes, what can he do? He is under your Care for Correction, and under his Father's only for Admonition; for he is your Servant.</p>

                  <speaker>Wife.</speaker>
                  <p>On the other Hand, I believe you would take it very ill to have one of their Fathers come to your Shop and <hi>cane</hi> or <hi>correct</hi> one of your Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, you would ſay he took the Work out of your Hands.</p>

                  <p>Abate that Nicety for once, <hi>my Dear,</hi> and make no Scruple to ſay what you think is my Duty to my Servants; tho' you do not think it your Part to teach me my Duty, you may be a Means to convince me, that ſomething was my Duty, which I did not think was my Duty before; and I may learn from you what you do not ſet up to teach; there need not be ſo much Shyneſs between a Wife and her Husband; that for Fear of taking too much upon you to teach me, you ſhould omit a kind Hint to me of what you think I ought to do.</p>

                  <p>I do not refrain for that ſo much, as that I think you know your Part ſo well, that it is perfectly unreaſonable and needleſs for me to offer any Thing; beſides, Family Government is ſo natural a Conſequence to the very Being and Conſtitution of Maſter and Servant, Father and Child, Husband and Wife, that no Husband <hi>of your Capacity</hi> can be ignorant; the Scripture is ſo
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:1046700601:281"/>
full on the Side of thoſe who are to be governed, that it cannot but lead directly to thoſe who are the Governours: Wives are bid to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Husbands; Children to obey their Parents; Servants to be Subject to their Maſters; all which naturally implies, that the Government of the whole Family devolves entirely upon the Head of the Maſter, who has the whole Charge of them, Soul and Body, and is accountable for their Miſcarriages, ſo far as thoſe Miſcarriages are owing to the Omiſſion of his Duty.</p>

                  <p>Indeed I can think no otherwiſe; <hi>eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Apprentices,</hi> who by their Indentures are entirely ſubjected to the Maſter's Government.</p>

                  <speaker>Wife.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed I think it extends to every thing elſe; we are obliged by the Fourth Commandment not to ſuffer our Servants to break the Sabbath, and ſo of every Duty in the other Commands; and no Queſtion but 'tis our Duty to reſtrain them from every evil Action, whereby they may offend GOD, or wrong their Neighbour: I mean as much as is in our Power; and on the other Hand, we are to encourage them in all that is good, <hi>viz.</hi> in their Duty to GOD and Man, and this by all poſſible Methods, ſuch as Exhortation, Command, Advice, <hi>viz.</hi> but eſpecially Example; praying to GOD for them and with them.</p>

As to my ſcrupling to join with Diſſenters, tho' I think it my Duty not to break off from the Church, yet ſure I have not ſuch an Opinion of conſcientious Diſſenters as to refuſe to pray to God with them: How could you think I would have married a Diſſenter, if that had been my Judgment? And have you not ſeen me readily join in Family Worſhip at your Brother's, as you have done with us at my Father's? Surely, if we have both joined with other Families of either Sort, we could not have wanted Charity ſo much as to have refuſed to do it in our own Houſe.</p>

               <p>The Young Gentleman was the Eldeſt Son of the Family, and Heir to his Father who had a good Eſtate, he had been bred a Gentleman, had a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Education, was a handſome agreeable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and which was beyond all, was <hi>like his Father,</hi> a ſober, virtuous, ſtudious and religious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: This Perſon having been converſant with this young Lady, by the Accident of their being in the Houſe; and as will appear, ſhe being very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, <hi>however engaged by the Defect of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation in Gayety and Mirth, and hard to be weaned, eſpecially by Violence as had been her Caſe,</hi> her Diſpoſition I ſay being ſoft and of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Sweetneſs in her Temper as will be ſeen in the Proceſs of theſe Sheets, there appear'd a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Suitableneſs in them one to another.</p>
               <p>The Young Gentleman had entertained an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of her being capable to make him a very good Wife; tho' he was not ignorant of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wild, and gay in her Humour, yet he had great Proofs by daily Converſation with her, of her being virtuous and modeſt, even to the utmoſt Nicety; the Goodneſs of her Temper, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of her Perſon, had engaged his Affections
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:1046700601:303"/>
to her, and he had no Reaſon to believe that ſhe had any Averſion to him; whereupon he broke his Deſign to his Father, who knowing his Son's Sobriety, and ſerious Inclination, was the leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to thwart his Affections; and the leſs afraid to venture him in the Matter of the young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Humour, tho' it was thought to be a little extravagant and gay <hi>as above;</hi> ſo the Father after ſome Conſideration calling him aſide one Morning, ſpoke to him to this Purpoſe.</p>
               <sp>
                  <p>SON, I have conſidered what you ſaid to me about your Deſire to court your Couſin, I am very willing to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie your Inclinations, in any Thing that may have a Proſpect of making you eaſy and happy, and ſhall be as kind to you with Reſpect to Eſtate, as you can expect; but <hi>you know</hi> ſhe is gay, and wild, loves Company and Mirth; and that it was her Impatience of Reſtraint in theſe Things, that made the Breach between her and her Father, and if ſhe ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue that Humour, after you have married her, I doubt you will have but an uncomfortable Life with her: <hi>However,</hi> I do not think her of an ill Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition as to her natural Temper; and perhaps ſhe may be prevailed with by good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage and kind Treatment, <hi>which I hope is all the Method you propoſe to take with her,</hi> to alter her Notions of Things; <hi>I</hi> think ſhe ſeems to be a little come off from ſome Part of it, ſince ſhe came into our Family, I would have you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider what Hazard you run in it, <hi>and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that the Venture is for your Life;</hi> and as I have no other Objection againſt it, I ſhall agree or not agree to it, as your Inclination ſhall lead you, only not forgetting to hint to you, <hi>what I hope you do not forget,</hi> (viz.) That you ask Council and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:1046700601:304"/>
of him who has ſaid, <hi>Commit thy Way unto the LORD, and he ſhall direct thy Steps.</hi>

               <p>This Diſcourſe was too affectionate and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, not to move a Son of ſo much Senſe and Goodneſs as he was, which he expreſt <hi>as became him</hi> in a dutiful and obliging Manner; and having after further Conſideration continued his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>not ſo only, but</hi> made ſome Advances of that Kind <hi>to the young Lady her ſelf;</hi> it became neceſſary in the next Place to have it moved to her <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> and as they were the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the old Lady, <hi>Mother-in-Law to the young Gentlewoman;</hi> this occaſioned her <hi>at her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Deſire</hi> to go to her Siſter <hi>the young Lady Mother,</hi> and break the Matter to her; where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little other Diſcourſe <hi>needleſs to our Purpoſe</hi> the Mother began with her, and ſo introduce the following Dialogue between the two Siſters, Mother and Aunt to the young Gentlewoman.</p>

                  <p>Truly with more Compoſure than I could have expected; he told him that <hi>as his Father</hi> he could not but be ſorry to ſee him puſh on his own Ruin; but as it was his Duty to exerciſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Father, he not only refuſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but forbid him to go: And withal bid him remember what he had ſaid to him before, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That if he ſet his Foot out of his Houſe upon this Account, he ſhould never ſet his Foot in it again, but <hi>as a Penitent.</hi>

                  <p>I took what Care I could of her, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to remove the Diſcontents of her Mind, for we all believed ſhe would die; I asked her if ſhe would ſee her Father, nay her Father who I think verily wept for her more than I did, would <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> ha' been tempted to have broke his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ha' been reconciled to her, and would fain ha' been ſo far reconciled as to ſee her; but when I did but Name him, ſhe burſt out into a fit of crying, and would not ſo much as hear of it; but <hi>her Brother! her Brother!</hi> if <hi>her Brother</hi> might come again, ſhe would ſee him: Well ſuch was the Tenderneſs of her Father to her, <hi>who moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately loved her,</hi> That he would ha' given Way to have her Brother come again; <hi>but when he came to be told of it,</hi> he inſolently anſwered, he would not come unleſs his Father would ſend for him: This you may be ſure was provoking; <hi>nay Siſter</hi> it moved me ſo, <hi>at them both;</hi> that tho' he is my

                  <p>Truly, he was not ſo provoked at it, as I thought he would ha' been; I mean, it did not throw him into a Paſſion; he retired into his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and in an Hour or two came down again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his Temper, but I could ſee <hi>like that of Job,</hi> his Grief was great; and indeed from that Time, I thought it my Duty rather to comfort my Husband, than my Daughter: While ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ill, he was very uneaſy, and impatient; but when ſhe recovered again, he was better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and thought leſs of her: Our next Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was, what was to be done with her; for our Family look'd very odly; we had Authority quite turned up Side down among us; inſtead of her Father refuſing to be reconciled to her, <hi>who had been the guilty Perſon, and had provoked him to the utmoſt,</hi> truly ſhe pretends Reſentment, and refuſes to be reconciled to her Father.</p>

                  <p>When ſhe was recovered, and was well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to go abroad; inſtead of going to Church to give GOD Thanks for reſtoring her Health, ſhe wanted to go to a young wild Companion of hers, <hi>my Lady Lighthead,</hi> that they might go to the Play together: I could not bear the Thoughts of this with any Patience; but being not willing to diſturb her Father with it, becauſe I knew it would exaſperate him; I took upon me to tell her of my own Authority, <hi>that ſhe ſhould not go;</hi> at which ſhe

                  <p>That Kind of Love is generally ſo retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Siſter;</hi> and Providence ſuffers it to be ſo as a juſt Puniſhment, for an ill grounded and unequal dividing our Affections among our Children, <hi>in which Caſe</hi> we may read our Sin in our Puniſhment; but I pray what ſaid you to her?

               <p>AS in the former Dialogue, when the Aunt came to treat of a Marriage for the Daughter, we had of Courſe the Mother telling us the Hiſtory of the Conduct of her Son and Daughter, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their coming home from the Garden from their Walk under the Lime-Trees,</hi> to the Time that both of them <hi>ſo rudely</hi> left their Father: So in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue which is between the <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>Siſter,</hi> we ſhall from their own Mouths, have an Account of the Meaſures they both took afterwards; <hi>firſt as to her Part,</hi> till juſt before ſhe went to be married, and ſecondly as to his Part till juſt before he went into the Army, and to his Travels <hi>as he called them.</hi> What became of both afterwards, we ſhall ſee in a Part by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Brother</hi> being now preparing for his Journey or Voyage, and the Siſter for her Wedding, they mutually deſired to converſe together about thoſe Things before they went on; and the Brother making his Siſter a Viſit, their firſt Converſation produces the following Dialogue.</p>

                     <hi>Yes he was;</hi> and then it was, That as I ſaid, he behaved ſo very obligingly to me; he told his Mother, for he ſeemed to ſpeak <hi>to her</hi> rather than to me, That he had found out a Way effectually to reconcile my Father and me, if I would approve of it: I told him I could not but approve of any reaſonable Way to be reconciled to my Father; for no body could ſuppoſe it was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to me to be turned out of my Father's Houſe; be look'd upon like a Vagabond, and having no Fortune or Subſiſtance, be left to go to Service, or be kept as it were upon Charity.

                  <p>Was it poſſible for you to Anſwer any Thing to ſo kind a propoſal, when made in ſuch ſerious Terms? certainly you could not Banter him than Siſter as you did before.</p>

                  <p>No I did not Banter him, <hi>I anſwered him thus;</hi> I told him that his Offer was too much for him to make, and too much for me to refuſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Apology for not making him a ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; but that he and I yet differed about the main Queſtion, <hi>(viz.) What it was my Father and I parted about,</hi> and perhaps he and I ſhould part about the ſame: For if before hand I knew that he was againſt my Part, then he was not able to be an Advocate; but only took upon him to bear the Ignominy of a Submiſſion for me; which was a Work I was not willing to put upon him, and a Debt I was not willing to owe him: That I had <hi>too much</hi> Reſpect for him to ſuffer him to do the firſt, and <hi>too little</hi> to Load my ſelf with the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the laſt. That on the other Hand, if he juſtified me, and believed my Father in the Wrong, all the Thoughts of reconciling of my Father were at an End. That as to taking me without it, I told him <hi>as I told you juſt now,</hi> That I ſeemed a fitter Match for one of his Father's Foot-men, than for <hi>his Father</hi>'s <hi>eldeſt Son;</hi> and had too much Reſpect for the Family, to fill up ſuch a Place, upon ſuch mean Conditions.</p>

Why then Madam ſaid I, we are talking of reconciling me to my Father, and <hi>as I told you,</hi> I ſhall be very glad of it; but as to making that Reconciliation a Means to what Mr. — propoſes, I do not ſee it will be any thing

to the Purpoſe, <hi>why ſo Niece?</hi> ſays my Aunt: Why Madam, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> this was the Reaſon why I have two or three times asked Mr. — if he rightly underſtood the Reaſons and Circumſtances of the Breach between me and my Father: He was pleaſed to ſay he did; <hi>tho' I can hardly think it.</hi> Now Madam, <hi>ſays I,</hi> it is my Opinion that Mr. — and I, ſhall differ as much <hi>about the ſame Things</hi> as my Father and I did; tho' perhaps not with ſo much unkindneſs, <hi>eſpecially if we differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it before hand;</hi> and therefore it is beſt Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Battle <hi>before</hi> than <hi>after,</hi> for you ſee I can deliver my ſelf from the Fury of a Father, but I know not my Caſe, <hi>if it had been a Husband:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Madam</hi> I think it is honeſter and kinder to Mr. — to have all this Matter ſettled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>now,</hi> than to leave things to hereafter; when I ſhall have neither Liberty <hi>to go away,</hi> nor freedom of Speech <hi>at Home,</hi> which would be to make my <hi>bad Caſe</hi> ten times worſe than it is.</p>

                  <p>She was ſtunned at it <hi>at Firſt,</hi> and ſeemed willing to have put it off to another Time; which ſhe afterwards told me, was, becauſe ſhe was afraid my Caſe ſhould be repreſented too much to my Diſadvantage: Mr. — ſeeing his Mother too backward to talk of it, thought there might be ſomething ſhe would not have him hear, and withdrew; <hi>which I was not pleas'd with,</hi> for ſince I ſaw they would make a Match of it, and I ſaw no great Reaſon to be averſe, or at leaſt obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo; I was willing to come to a certainty, and know what kind of Life I was to live; for I was reſolved, I would no more be <hi>a married Nun,</hi> than I would be a <hi>Cloiſtered Daughter;</hi> however he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withdrawn, my Aunt and I began the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

truſted with ſo much of the Government of our ſelves, as to be paſt Schooling and Tutelage: We made no other uſe of thoſe Liberties than became a modeſt Behaviour; they can charge us with nothing Criminal or Scandalous: No Vice, nothing injurious to our Reputation; when all of a ſudden without any Notice, we were fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, abridged of all lawful Liberties, were to have new Lectures of Family Diſcipline read to us, which we were abſolutely to ſubmit to, and to commence Children again; <hi>This you may be ſure we thought hard,</hi> and my Share was immediately to fall under Correction; for my Mother, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Provocation, <hi>as I thought,</hi> flew to my Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, took away all my Books, and flung them in the Fire, and laid her Hands upon me into the Bargain; this I thought <hi>at my Age</hi> was unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Uſage.</p>

               <head>The Third DIALOGUE.</head>
               <p>THE two laſt Dialogues are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be a Recapitulation of what had been acted ſome time paſt, in order to introduce this part, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Connection of the Hiſtory. The Daughter is now to be talked of, as having been married ſome Time. The Son was gone to Travel, and having been returned into <hi>Flanders,</hi> was gone to his Poſt in the Army, where being in the Confederate Service, and commanded out upon Action, he fell in with a Party of the <hi>French,</hi> and being very much wounded in the Fight, was taken Priſoner and carried to <hi>Cambray;</hi> from whence he wrote his Siſter a Letter, of which in its Courſe.</p>
               <p>The new married Couple had for above two Years lived together, as they were at firſt with his Father, and her Aunt; during which Time ſhe had had two Children, and the Treatment ſhe had met with there, had been ſo kind, ſo diverting and ſo obliging, That ſhe could have no Reaſon to ſay that they had not perform'd fully the Engagement her Husband had made with her, to endeavour to make her forget the Affliction of the Breach with her Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:1046700601:350"/>
Her Husband carried it with ſo much Tenderneſs and Affection to her, as was capable to engage and win a Temper far more Refractory than hers; and by his obliging Carriage he prevented many little Excurſions which her Inclination would otherways have led her too; yet two things remained, (1ſt.) She could not perſwade herſelf to like a regular kind of Family Government; She loved Company, which ſhe had been accuſtomed to, and a little to Play; and when ſhe made her Viſits, would ſometimes ſtay at Cards or other Diverſions very late. (2d.) She could not bear to think of ſtooping to own her Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaviour to her Father, or to make any Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him; nor could her Husband, tho' he failed in no Endeavour, bring that Breach to an End without it.</p>
               <p>As her Family encreaſed, and on the other Hand her Ways were not very agreeable to the Family ſhe was in, it ſeemed neceſſary, to think of ſettling themſelves apart; and her Husband having a very good Houſe of his own near the City, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved they ſhould do ſo; and accordingly as we ſay, they began Houſekeeping.</p>
               <p>And now began the Tryal of her Husband's Temper, and Patience to the utmoſt: The Caſe was thus, Being now to be a Maſter of a Family, he was obliged to take upon him the Charge of Family Government; he had not only been religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly educated, <hi>but as has been before obſerved,</hi> was a very ſerious religious Gentleman himſelf, it was his Affliction, that he found very little Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance in his Wife to any thing that was religious; and therefore he entred into no Conference with her about eſtabliſhing the Orders of his Family; but as ſoon as his Houſe was furniſhed, and his Family removed, he reſolved like a true Chriſtian to begin with the Worſhip of God, in his Houſe, and that he
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:1046700601:351"/>
might leave no room to her to diſpute it, he did this without ſo much as mentioning it to his Wife; as if it was a thing which it ought to be taken for granted, was as naturally and neceſſarily to be done in a Family, as providing Food and Conveniences for their Subſiſtance; however as if to make this more Eligible, and to introduce it without any ſeeming Impoſition upon his Wife, he invited his Father and Mother, and a Miniſter who was their Acquaintance to ſup with them <hi>the firſt Night of their Houſekeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and before Supper, his Wife being in the Room, he askt the Miniſter aloud, <hi>if he would pleaſe to be their Chaplain for that Night?</hi> The Wife could not offer to oppoſe it, tho' he could eaſily perceive ſhe look'd a little ſtrange at it; ſo the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter as had been concerted gladly accepting the Offer, Books were brought in, the Servants called together, and Family Prayers performed <hi>the firſt Night:</hi> after this was done and Supper over, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the Miniſter, <hi>who it ſeems lived in the Country,</hi> to ſtay two or three Days with him, which he alſo accepted; ſo of Courſe Prayers were had every Night and Morning while the Miniſter ſtay'd; and thus the Worſhip of God was quietly introduced into the Family, and after the Miniſter was gone, the Servants to whom it was no Novelty, having been all in the Family before, came of Courſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the uſual Hour, and he performed it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>His Wife who was more diſguſted at his taking no notice of it to her, than at the thing it ſelf; <hi>as if it was a beginning of ſome new Method which he intended to take with her,</hi> took a great many Ways to let him ſee ſhe was not very well pleas'd; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the uſual Time when he would ſay, <hi>Come call in the Servants.</hi> She would give a Smile as a Signal of Contempt; often ſhe would be buſy above Stairs,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:1046700601:352"/>
and not come down at all; very often, tho' ſhe would come, ſhe would make him wait a good while; and when ſhe came into the Room, would ſay with ſome Diſdain, <hi>what need you ha' ſtaid for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However <hi>he took no Notice of all this,</hi> and tho' ſhe ſtrove by all the Ways ſhe could to have made him ſpeak of it firſt, yet he ſhunned it; reſolving not to have any Diſpute with her, <hi>if it were poſſible to avoid it;</hi> but ſhe ſoon took Care to make it unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Being become now a Miſtreſs of a Family, he hoped ſhe would have had ſome Conſideration for the Station ſhe was in, and have appeared with a little of that Gravity and Authority that became her; but on the contrary ſhe intirely omitted all Appearance of any ſuch thing; ſhe viſited oftner than ever; ſhe play'd at Cards abroad two or three Times a Week, and <hi>at home,</hi> as often as ſhe could get Company; ſhe went almoſt nightly to the Play, in ſhort ſhe began to lead a Life ſo different from the reſt of the Family, and ſo uneaſie to him, and all his and her Friends, That it was greatly afflicting and perplexing to him.</p>
               <p>During all this Time he treated her with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Tenderneſs and the moſt obliging Carriage that was poſſible; only it could not be conceal'd neither from her, nor from all the Houſe, that his Wife's Conduct was an extreme Affliction to him; <hi>and the more,</hi> becauſe he ſaw no poſſible method to go about to Reclaim her.</p>
               <p>His Wife finding her ſelf unreſtrained, grew ſtill worſe, and at length contented not her ſelf to give her vanity its full ſwing, but appeared diſcontented that he would not do the like: If ſhe went to the Play, he would ſometimes go with her to the Door, <hi>as he had ſaid he would when he courted her;</hi> but would not go in, which ſhe pretended ſhe took
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:1046700601:353"/>
very ill of him; when he viſited any where <hi>with her,</hi> where he ſaw her reſolved to ſtay late at Cards, he would excuſe himſelf, and leave her; and it was much if ſhe did not Flout him before the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in ſome ſuch manner as this, <hi>what you want to go home and ſa your Prayers!</hi> which he would turn off with a Smile, or a Jeſt, and withdraw; but ſtill theſe things were very grievous to him.</p>
               <p>During all this and much more, <hi>nothing anger'd her ſo much,</hi> as that he would not take the Caſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Debate with her, but he reſolved to go on in the Duties of a Maſter in his Family, and to give her no Occaſion to ſay he uſed her amiſs; ſo that all this while he ſaid nothing to her, till at laſt ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with him upon the following Occaſion.</p>
               <p>His eldeſt Child, a fine little Boy, was now almoſt three Years old: He had been but too well aſſured, That his Wife took little Care to Teach the Child any Thing that might lay an early foundation of a religious Knowledge in its Mind; wherefore upon all Opportunities he would be talking to the little Creature in ſuch Language as was fitteſt for him to underſtand. <hi>(viz) Of who made him?</hi> and <hi>who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed him? what God was;</hi> and <hi>that he muſt ſerve God,</hi> and he like; <hi>as is uſual to ſay to little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:</hi> and his Wife takes that Opportunity to break in upon him one Day in purſuance of her former Reſolution, and began with him while he was talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his little Son in the following Manner.</p>

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:1046700601:356"/>
yet the Manner of doing it was by impoſing a Compliance in me, ſince I was not thought worthy to be ſpoken to about: But you ſee <hi>I do not Trouble you much with my Company.</hi>

walking very melancholly in ſome Fields near the Houſe all alone by him ſelf: By this Time ſhe was entirely come to her ſelf, and ſeeing him walk ſo ſolitarily, made her very uneaſie; ſhe ſends a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to him, to tell him ſhe deſired to ſpeak with him, and in hopes of his coming, ſhe run out into the Garden to meet him, but the Boy brought her Word again he was gone, and he could not find him.</p>
               <p>Now ſhe began violently to reproach her ſelf with her ill Uſage of her Husband, and ſhutting her ſelf into her Chamber, ſhe reflected bitterly on her ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What a Brute have I been</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>to the beſt Husband that ever Woman had: That took me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Farthing Portion, when I was turned out of Doors by my Father and Mother; that never ſaid an unkind Thing to me in his Life, that when I have loſt</hi> 50 <hi>l. at a Time at Play, never ſaid ſo much as why did you do ſo, or grudg'd parting with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?</hi> What barbarous Language have I given him! <hi>And how calmly and tenderly has he returned all along, without one unkind Word; ſure I am the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt Brute of a Wife that ever any Man had! And don't deſerve that ever he ſhould have the leaſt Value for me again.</hi> She ſtopt a while and wept vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, and then went on with her Exclamations upon her ſelf thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then,</hi> what have I quarrelled with him for! <hi>but for what all the Women in the Nation but I, would value a Man for;</hi> (viz.) <hi>For his being ſober, and virtuous, and religious; and did ever a Fool talk to a Husband as I did, about his Family Orders! his Praying to GOD! and the like; why, my own Conſcience tells me that he is in the Right, and I am in the wrong, and tho' I mind nothing my ſelf, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but own he does well; ſure I am the worſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

                  <hi>alive! There are many Women and Men too, that have Religion little enough; but ſure never any Woman abuſed a Husband for being better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here ſhe burſt out into Tears again, and ſtill impatient; upon every little Noiſe ſhe heard in the Houſe, to know if her Husband was come Home.</p>
               <p>Her Husband had born all her Taunts with the utmoſt Patience as above, and had not withdrawn at laſt, but that he found himſelf moved by her talking irreligiouſly and prophanely; when fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould fly out in a Paſſion too, and ſo give her any indecent Language <hi>as ſhe did him,</hi> and which he thought himſelf obliged to avoid; <hi>he withdrew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was however not only ſurprized, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely afflicted at this Treatment; and not only at this as an Accident, but at the ſad Proſpect of what he was to expect from the Continuance of it; and that both as it reſpected the Conduct of her ſelf abroad, which began to be publick; and alſo the Treatment he was to have from her at Home.</p>
               <p>However, as the beſt Remedy for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of his Paſſions, he went immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Cloſet, and prayed earneſtly to GOD for a patient ſubmiſſive Frame in himſelf to all his Providences; that he might not lay any Streſs upon the Inſtrument, but view the Meaning and Deſign of Soveraign Goodneſs in all thoſe Things; <hi>not forgetting</hi> at the ſame time to Pray very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely for his Wife, That GOD would open her Eyes, convince her of her Sin, and bring her Home to himſelf, by a true Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>

               <p>As ſoon as he came in, <hi>which was later than his uſual Time,</hi> and upon enquiring for his Wife, was told by the Servants, that ſhe was very ill, he ran directly up Stairs into her Chamber before any Body could give her Notice of his being come; <hi>but the</hi> who liſtened too attentively to want a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, heard him coming up Stairs, and raſing haſtily off the Couch, ſhe ran to the top of the

               <p>He called out for Help, and the Servants imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately running in, ſhe was carried back to her Chamber, and in ſome ſhort time ſhe came to her ſelf again; but finding her Husband ſitting by her, and very anxious for her, it renewed her Grief, and made her for ſome Time unable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her ſelf freely.</p>
               <p>When ſhe was entirely recovered, and fit to converſe, <hi>ſhe ordered the Servants to withdraw;</hi> and then with Abundance of Tears ſhe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>to him</hi> how ſenſible ſhe was, That ſhe had uſed him ill; and that ſhe had not behaved her ſelf as became her, in any of her Carriage to him; how afflicted ſhe had been at his Abſence ſo long, believing that ſhe had exaſperated him, and grieved him, and in ſhort aſſured him, ſhe would endeavour to make him amends by a quite different Behaviour to him, all her Life after.</p>

               <p>The Grief of this ſurpriſing Letter, and the Concern ſhe had been in before, upon her Breach with her Husband, put her into ſuch an Agony, That ſhe ſpoke not a Word, but inceſſantly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and wept; nor could the tendereſt moſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Expreſſions of her Husband, who never ſtirred from her, procure a Word from her, all that Evening; ſhe went to Bed indeed, but got no Sleep that Night, and by the next Morning it had thrown her into a high Fever, which brought her to Death's Door, <hi>as we call it;</hi> and as it pleaſed GOD, That during the Violence of her Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſhe retained the perfect Uſe of her Senſes; ſo the Senſe of her Danger awakened her to a Senſe of her Duty, as will appear in the next Dialogue.</p>

               <head>The Fourth DIALOGUE.</head>
               <p>THE Laſt Dialogue gave an Account of the Accident which had thrown the Young Married Lady into a dangerous Fever, and left her in a very weak Condition; her Husband as he was a tender affectionate Relation, and was in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Concern and Affliction for her, ſeeing a great deal of Danger of her Life; ſo as he was alſo a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chriſtian, he could not be without inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Anxieties for her future State: He had been backward to ſpeak to her of Death, or of any of the Perplexities which were upon him, for her Condition; leaſt the Impreſſion ſhould be aſſiſtant to the Diſeaſe; yet he thought it was his indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible Duty, not to be wanting to make her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of her Danger as to her Soul's Condition; and eſpecially as to the Breach with her Father, which he always acknowledged was unjuſtifiable, and a great Sin in her both againſt God and her Father.</p>
               <p>While he was ſitting mournfully by her, and his Heart oppreſt with the Struggle he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Duty to tell her his Thoughts, and his Fear of injuring her Health by it; ſhe put an End to his Trouble of that kind, by beginning with him <hi>thus.</hi>

               </sp>
               <p>Upon her earneſt Requeſt her Husband prayed with her, and She ſeemed ſo affected with <hi>the Confeſſion of Sin,</hi> which he made to be as it were the Introductory Part of his Prayer, that from that Time forward, he entertained great Hopes of her being a true Penitent.</p>
               <p>He avoided being long, in Reſpect of her Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but as he was never from her, either Night or Day, ſhe cauſed him to Pray with her almoſt every two Hours, and ſometimes would break out in ſhort Ejaculatory Prayers for her ſelf; in which he could perceive, mingled with deep Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Confeſſion; plain Appearances of her having more Hope of her future State, than before.</p>
               <p>Her Husband encouraged by this, in one of his Prayers making Confeſſion of Sin, mentioned ſomething of the Errors and Miſtakes of Youth, which we are hurried into by the Violence of our Paſſions, and the violent Affection with which we entertain our Pleaſures, and Vanities; and then went on to a Confeſſion of the Sin of rejecting the Council of our Inſtructors, and refuſing to ſtoop to the juſt Reproofs of thoſe, who we are committed to by the Conſequence of our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by our Dependance upon them; and who it is our Duty to ſubmit to; thus proceeding to point out, <hi>tho' gently,</hi> the Sin ſhe had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, in reſiſting the Admonitions of her Parents; imploring GOD's Pardon for it, and that her Eyes might be opened, to ſee and acknowledge it.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as this Prayer was over, ſhe turned her ſelf towards him, <hi>and reaching out her Hands to him,</hi> ſhe embrac'd him with great Paſſion and Earneſtneſs, as her Strength would permit; <hi>my Dear,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I bleſs GOD, for what he has
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:1046700601:385"/>
put into thy Heart to ſay upon that Subject; I am convinc'd I have ſinned greatly in that matter of my Father; <hi>I am convinc'd, I am convinc'd,</hi> repeating the Words ſeveral Times with very great Earneſtneſs, and Abundance of Tears.</p>
               <p>Her Husband told her, he was very glad to hear her ſay ſo much, That it had layn much upon his Mind, to mention it to her, <hi>but that he was loath to grieve her,</hi> but he hoped that as GOD had been pleaſed to make her ſenſible of the Evil of it, ſo he would, <hi>as of old in the Caſe of the great Penitent David,</hi> no ſooner give her a Reſolution to confeſs the Sin, but add the Comfort of his Pardon. <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſs my Tranſgreſſion unto the LORD, and thou forgaveſt the Iniquity of my Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She look'd up with a kind of a Smile at theſe Words, and ſaid GOD will for give me <hi>my dear,</hi> tho' my Father won't; at which her Husband ſaid, <hi>my Dear,</hi> if GOD forgive us, it is not ſo much to us, if others do not; but I dare ſay if thy <hi>Father</hi> heard thee, he would not wait for any farther Acknowledgment; ſhall I let him know it ſaid her Husband, I know his Heart mourns for thee: <hi>My Dear,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I am in an ill Condition to ask him Forgiveneſs now, but <hi>if he was here,</hi> I would do it as well as I could with all my Heart; and here her Tears again interrupting her, ſhe ſaid no more.</p>
               <p>Her Husband found it was not proper to ſay much more to her at that Time, her Diſtemper being violent, ſo he withdrew; ſecretly pleaſed to hear her ſpeak with ſo much Earneſtneſs and Concern about her Father; and immediately ſent a Servant to her Father, with a Letter to tell him, he deſired to ſee him in the Morning; and withal wrote ſome Account of the Occaſion; the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:1046700601:386"/>
Father tho' he took the News of her Illneſs very heavily, for he ſtill loved her very tenderly; yet received this Part of the Account with great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and came early in the Morning to the Houſe, where his Son-in-Law gave him an Account of all the Particulars of his Wiſe's Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>But it was too late; for her Fever had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed upon her with ſo much Violence in the Night; That when her Father came into the Room, She was Speechleſs; and to all outward Appearance, at the very Point of Death.</p>
               <p>Her Husband, tho' paſſionately afflicted at ſo ſad a Sight; yet willing to give her all the Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he could, ſpoke cloſe to her Ear, That her Father was come, but ſhe did not ſeem to take any Notice of it; her repeated it, adding he was come to give her his Bleſſing, and aſſure her that he had forgiven all the Breach between them; at which Words ſhe opened her Eyes, and look'd at her Father, but cloſed them immediately, and remained ſpeechleſs; <hi>my Dear!</hi> ſaid her Husband; <hi>give us a Sign if you underſtand us, would you have your Father forgive you?</hi> At which ſhe lifted up her Hand; <hi>and pray for thee,</hi> ſaid her Husband! At which ſhe lifted up her Hand again, and juſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Eyes, <hi>but could not ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was a melancholly Sight, for two ſuch near Relations to bear; nor did it afford any thing more, that ſerves to our preſent Purpoſe. The Father prayed by her Bed ſide, and gave GOD Thanks for any Appearances of Mercy to her Soul; and committing her into the Hands of her Redeemer they retired, expecting her departing every Moment.</p>
               <p>But Providence had otherwiſe determined it, for tho' ſhe lay in that Condition two or three Days, yet it pleaſed GOD, <hi>after that,</hi> the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:1046700601:387"/>
ſeemed to abate, and ſhe came to her Speech again, and in a few Days more grew better, tho' ſo very weak, as made her Recovery be very ſlow.</p>
               <p>Now a new Care and Anxiety ſeized upon her Husband; who tho' truly joyful at the Hopes he had of his Wife's Recovery, which a few Days before there was no Room to expect; Yet he could not but be fearful, leaſt her Convictions ſhould wear off with a Senſe of her Danger, <hi>as is uſual in the Caſe of Death-bed Repentance;</hi> and that <hi>the near Proſpect of Death now diſappearing,</hi> her Love of Vanity and Pleaſure ſhould return with her Health; and therefore <hi>like one that truly loved her Soul's Advantage, as well as her Perſonal Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare;</hi> he began early to put her in mind of the Debt ſhe owed to the Goodneſs of GOD; which ſeemed to be giving her a new Life: and to whom the Hours he ſhould now beſtow ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, as given for that Purpoſe; his often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating theſe Things, gave Occaſion to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe, which tho' it ſuffered ſeveral Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions from her Weakneſs, yet it being all to the ſame Purpoſe, will be very well read as one continued Dialogue: She began with her Husband upon the Occaſion <hi>as I have noted,</hi> of his often repeating his Cautions againſt forgetting after her recovering, the Senſe of her State, which ſhe had upon her Mind when ſhe was in Expectation of Death.</p>

               <p> which put the Family into a great Diſorder, fearing the Return of her Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: After ſhe had lain ſome Time, and was a little refreſhed, ſhe deſired her Father and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to come up into her Chamber: While ſhe lay indiſpoſed on her Bed, her Husband had rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her Father all the Diſcourſe that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between them, which ſo affected her Father, that he could not bear giving her the Uneaſineſs of farther Confeſſions; and therefore when ſhe ſent for them up, the Father ſpoke to her Husband thus: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Son I deſire you will go up firſt, and tell her, <hi>Word for Word,</hi> what I ſay to you, as near as you can remember.<p>"Firſt, tell her, you have related to me the Diſcourſe that was between her and you, and that I am fully ſatisfied with, and rejoice in the Acknowledgment ſhe has made of her former Carriage to me, and of her Deſign to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it farther: That I already think it more than enough; that as neither her Weakneſs <hi>on the one Hand,</hi> can bear it; ſo neither can my Affection to her on the other Hand bear any

               </p>
               <p>Her Husband did ſo, and with much Difficulty prevailed with her to promiſe; upon which her Father being brought in, went to her, <hi>and kiſt her</hi> as ſhe lay, and praying earneſtly in few words to God to bleſs her, and continue his Goodneſs to her; he comforted her in the following manner.</p>

               <p>The Tragical Part of this Story remains, and will make the Concluſion of this Work. The Subject is, the miſerable wretched Caſe of the Young Gentleman, the Brother to this Lady; and who had gone abroad as has been ſaid, but was partly by his Wounds, Sickneſs, and Misfortune, but principally by his Vices and Extravagance, reduced to the laſt Extremity of Miſery; had waſted his Eſtate, ſold his Commiſſion, loſt one of his Arms, and was brought to the Neceſſity of writing to his Father for Subſiſtance, and for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to bring him over to <hi>England;</hi> of which the Particulars will appear in the next Dialogue.</p>

               <p>IN the Laſt Dialogue you have ſome Account of the Condition the Young Gentleman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned was reduced to, in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his Siſter, dated from <hi>Cambray:</hi> where he was under Cure of his Wounds.</p>
               <p>It ſeems his Extravagance had reduced him to the laſt Extremity, and having had his Arm cut off, and falling into a long Fit of Sickneſs after it; tho' he was exchanged by Virtue of the Cartel for Exchange of Priſoners, and ſo had his Freedom; yet he could not be removed, and was at laſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſell his Commiſſion; after which, ſeeing himſelf reduced to great Extremities, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Miſery, even of wanting Bread being in his View; he wrote a ſecond Letter to his Father, which being brought by a Perſon, who gave a particular Account of his Condition; moved his Father to take Compaſſion of him, and relieve him.</p>

               <p>The tender compaſſionate Father, tho' he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his Son's Treatment of him deeply enough, and ſteadily adhered to the Reſolution of never receiving him into his Family, unleſs he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his firſt Crime, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of withſtanding the Reformation of his Father's Houſe; yet being by no means obliged by that Reſolution, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him in Diſtreſs, or to let him ſtarve in a ſtrange Country, having enquired into the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of his Circumſtances, from the Gentleman who brought the Letter, and underſtanding by him that his Son was reduced to the utmoſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; he immediately remitted Money over to a Dutch Merchant at <hi>Liſle,</hi> with Orders to give him preſent Subſiſtance, and to bring him from <hi>Cambray</hi> thither, in Order to his being ſent over to <hi>England;</hi> all which the ſaid Merchant effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally performed, and the poor reduced Gentleman arrived at <hi>London</hi> ſoon after.</p>
               <p>It was the very ſame Day of his Arrival, when he cauſed his Father to have Notice that he was coming to lay himſelf at his Door; but the Father tho' he had relieved him, and deſigned to take
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:1046700601:402"/>
Care that he ſhould not want, yet judging it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to let him know that his Reſentments had been very juſt; and that he was to be ſatisfied further, with Relation to Things paſt, before he could be reſtored to the State of an Eldeſt Son, if ever that was to be done at all; gave him the Mortification of fignifying to him by a Meſſenger, That he was not to be admitted to ſee his Father, or to come into his Houſe yet; but that he was to go to ſuch a Place, not far off, where a Lodging was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for him.</p>
               <p>This afflicted him extremely; at firſt it threw him into a violent Paſſion, expoſtulating with the Meſſenger in ſuch Words as theſe, What! Has my Father brought me thus far, but to trample on my Miſery, and to make his Reſentment ſink the deeper; or has he brought me like a Criminal to the Place of Execution; thus, <hi>as he may think it</hi> to do Juſtice upon me! Why had he not ſuffered me to periſh where I was, rather than come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die with the more Affliction and Reproach? The Meſſenger told him his Buſineſs was not to diſpute with him, but to deliver his Meſſage; That he had no further Inſtructions, And ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Coach Man Directions where to go, he told the poor Gentleman, he would go before to receive him, and took his Leave.</p>
               <p>The unhappy Gentleman bid the Coach Man go on, and in a little Time he found himſelf paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by his Father's Door; this ſtruck him with an inexpreſſible Grief, even into an Agony of Shame, Anger, and Deſpair; when in that very Moment his Dream came to his Mind, which he had related to his Siſter; and which we have ſet down in the firſt Dialogue <hi>of this Part. (viz.) How that having his Arm ſhot off, and being relieved by his Father abroad, and brought over; tho' he came</hi>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:1046700601:403"/>
                  <hi>to his Father's Door, yet he would not take him in, but had ordered him to a Neighbour's Houſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"As ſoon as this revolved upon his Thoughts, it immediately quieted him, and he broke out into this Expreſſion. <hi>Well!</hi> Now I ſee that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing befalls us without the determinate Will of that Soveraign Power that guides and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the whole World: This was ſo long ago repreſented to me in a Dream; how exactly is every Step of it come to paſs upon me! God is juſt! and it is my Part to ſubmit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This quieted his Mind for ſome Time, and he went on to the Houſe which his Father had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him; where he found the Servant who <hi>as he had ſaid</hi> went before; who helped him in, for he was ſo weak, he could hardly go, and coming into a Chamber provided for him, <hi>fetching a deep Sigh,</hi> he threw himſelf on the Bed, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Word; and in this Condition he remained all that Night, and Part of the next Day; no body coming to him, but the People of the Houſe, who were however directed to attend him and ſupply him with Neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>In the Evening he heard a Coach ſtop at the Door; and ſoon after a Lady coming up Stairs who was brought into his Chamber, and who he preſently knew to be his Siſter; ſhe found him very weak, ſitting in a Chair by the Fire, leaning his Head upon his Hand, and his Elbow on a Table that ſtood by him; his Eyes fixed on the Ground; his Countenance to the laſt Degree dejected, pale, and thin; and in ſhort as like a Spectre as any Thing that was real Fleſh and Blood could be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be: As ſhe came forward into the Room, he lifted up his Eyes, and ſaid only this Word, <hi>Siſter!</hi> and would have riſen up, but had not Strength; She deſigned to have embraced him, but
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:1046700601:404"/>
when ſhe ſaw him, ſhe was frighted and amazed, and ſat down over againſt him at ſome Diſtance, being ready to ſwoon away: At firſt ſhe could hardly be convinc'd it was really her Brother; and when ſhe was ſatisfied of that, the very ſeeing him in that Condition, ſtruck her with ſuch Grief, That ſhe could not ſpeak a Word to him for a great while. Being recovered a little, <hi>My Dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!</hi> Said ſhe, and would have gone on, but ſhe burſt out into Tears; however theſe Tranſports which the Surpirze of ſeeing him in ſuch a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might very well be ſuppoſed to work in ſo near a Relation, being a little over, they began to diſcourſe a little together, and after the uſual Queſtions concerning his Health, and the proper Remedies to be uſed to recover his Strength <hi>and the like;</hi> the following Dialogue contains the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their Diſcourſe.</p>

                     <hi>Dear Brother,</hi> it is very wonderful, and I have often thought on that Dream, and of my Aunt's Prediction alſo, about the ſame time, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That you would be brought to want Bread, and to beg my Father to relieve you; tho' I was in hopes it would never ha' come to that Paſs.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>It is a Teſtimony that <hi>nothing befalls us</hi> without an Inviſible Hand; I acknowledge his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but I cannot but think, that my Father is very ſevere, and indeed very cruel.</p>

                  <p>That is, <hi>becauſe</hi> you take the firſt Part of this Affair, without the ſubſequent, which is in his Deſign; and which I hope will make all end well ſtill, if you can be perſwaded to act with Temper and Patience.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Dear Brother!</hi> I hope you are ſenſible of it: If ſuch Judgments as you have met with, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make you ſenſible, nothing will! However as all your Dream is not come to paſs, I ſhall fulfill the reſt, by which beſides my Reſpect to you, that Excuſe ſhall be taken away, <hi>(viz)</hi> That you are neceſſitated to make Submiſſions for Bread; I hope you will do it from a mere Senſe of the Sin, and of God's Anger and Juſtice, as well as of your Father's Diſpleaſure: And that you may not be in a Neceſſity of doing it otherwiſe; take that Part

of your Dream too, for your preſent Comfort, for you dream't I brought you ſome Money.</p>

her Father, who was waiting impatiently to hear what his Son had ſaid to her, being himſelf diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have treated him with the utmoſt Kindneſs, and Tenderneſs. As ſoon as he ſaw her, he began thus.</p>

                  <p>I believe it would break your Heart to ſee him; he is Lame with a Wound in his Knee, one Arm cut off, thin and lean as one dying of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: He looks pale and melancholly, and indeed is to the laſt Degree, dejected and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate.

                     <hi>Why,</hi> the Servant you ſent, ſurprized him, with telling him too haſtily, that you had ordered him to a Lodging, and not to bring him Home: And then to encreaſe it, the Coach very unhappily drove by the Door here; and it grieved him ſo much, to ſee himſelf brought to his Father's Door, and could not have Leave to come in; that he fell into a violent Paſſion, the People ſay, he raged ſo much all Night, <hi>tho' they knew not at what,</hi> That they were afraid he would deſtroy himſelf; and he lays it ſo to Heart ſtill, that it grieves me, I know not what to do for him.</p>

                  <p>I heard indeed that he flew out into a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Fellow was a Fool to deliver his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage inſolently, and alſo to bring him by the Door;
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:1046700601:415"/>
there was no need of it; but as for not coming in, he knew my Terms of his Return; and I know that he expected no other before he came over; but he might eaſily think my bringing him hither, was in Order to receive him kindly, and make his Submiſſions as cheap to him, as I could.</p>

                     <hi>No really,</hi> he bid me ſay to you, That he is very ſorry he has given you Offence, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that he went away without your Leave, and that he will ask you Pardon with all his Heart.</p>

                     <hi>But Child,</hi> does he come to the main Point; will he acknowledge his Sin againſt GOD and his Father, in reſiſting the juſt Meaſures taken for the Reformation of our Family, and his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Houſe upon that Account. For which I ſolemnly declared to him, <hi>That if he went away upon that Score, he ſhould never return, but as a Penitent.</hi>

               </sp>

                  <speaker>Dau.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope Sir, you will conſtrue his asking you Pardon in general, to contain all that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>Why ſhould I conſtrue it <hi>Child,</hi> a Way that he does not declare it to be underſtood? For I have had ſome Information already, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the contrary.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dau.</speaker>
                  <p>I am in hopes <hi>Sir,</hi> he will not declare that, and I hope you will let his Condition plead a little for him; Miſery diſorders our Tempers, as well as our Body.</p>

                  <speaker>Dau.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps he may be better Sir, when his Concern at this Accident is a little over; I am loath to afflict him, for he is ſo weak, I fear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing him, may kill him.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>I could find in my Heart, to go to him my ſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dau.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot ſay <hi>Sir,</hi> whether it may be better or worſe; if he be in Temper, it muſt needs be to his Advantage, to have you ſee him; but if his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance at this Affair, is not over, tho' he be ſo low reduced, I fear his obſtinate Temper.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>What, does he think, That I take Occaſion from his Miſery, to force him to a Submiſſion?</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>Come then, I have a Thought of an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to remove his Reſentment; for I will not leave him the leaſt Room to complain of me, nor indeed do I deſire, or value a forced Submiſſion; if GOD has not wrought a Change upon him by his Afflictions, it is not my forcing him that will do any good: If he makes any Acknowledgments from the Power of his preſent Neceſſities, they will be but Hypocritical and inſincere, and ſuch a Kind of Penitence as will not be acceptable to GOD, I am ſure will be very unſatisfying to me.</p>

                  <p>I'll tell you what you ſhall do; <hi>go back to him,</hi> and tell him, I had no Deſign to put any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front upon him; or to ſuppreſs him in his Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at all; and if my Servant behaved ill to him, it was without my Order.</p>

                  <p>Then <hi>tell him,</hi> he knows the Reaſon, why I cannot agree to take him Home; which Reaſon it is in his Power to remove when he pleaſes; tell him that when he thinks fit to remove it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, he ſhall be received with as much Affection and Kindneſs as he can expect; but that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to take Advantage of his Miſery to oblige him to that Submiſſion, tho' I have good Reaſon to do ſo: And that therefore I allow him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, whether he pleaſes to go for his Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: And I will allow him 50 <hi>l.</hi> a Year for his Subſiſtance; and there's 10 <hi>l.</hi> for him, for his preſent Supply: Thus he is left entirely free, either to comply with his Father, or not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with him, as GOD ſhall pleaſe to influence his Mind; he can complain of no Force or ill U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage on my Side.</p>

of GOD upon you, both of your paſt Sin, and your preſent Duty; but that he ſcorns to put any Force upon you, or to preſs you by the Violence of your Neceſſities to comply with him, it muſt be GOD's Work, or it can be no Satisfaction to him, and therefore he leaves you to your Liberty.</p>

                  <p>Had my Father come hither in that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſaid thoſe Words you ſay from him; I ſhould ha' thrown my ſelf at his Foot, with more Submiſſion than he can expect.</p>

                  <p>O Brother! You have not a Senſe of the Crime, tho' you have ſome Senſe of the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I hope ſtill Time may open your Eyes; for the preſent I would be glad to recover your Spirits, and cheer your Thoughts a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that you may conſider Things with more Compoſure; will you tell me what Courſe you will take.</p>
