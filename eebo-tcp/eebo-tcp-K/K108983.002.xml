            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>WHICH WILL SHEW THAT THE SNAKE WAS SCOTCHED—NOT
KILLED.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>As I intimated at the end of the firſt volume, that the pranks
of the mad muſician, extraneous as at firſt ſight they muſt appear, had
relation, and very ſtrongly too, to the main and moſt material part of my
deſign, ſo I ſhall now proceed to ſhew in what way.</p>
               <p>The reader will allow me that, according to the letter of my
deſcription, which really did not outgo the fact, the buſtle at the inn
muſt, to ſtrangers, and particularly ladies, have been alarming to a 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1185300302:4"/> great degree; and when it is conſidered that Lady Hazard
was ſeven months gone with child, it will not appear very extraordinary that,
terrified in ſo unexpected and particular a manner, it ſhould have ſuch
an effect upon her tender and delicate frame, as to throw her into labour,
which it actually did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Standfaſt, upon this news, undertook to produce a
gentleman of the faculty from London, whither he went as faſt as a chaiſe
and four horſes could convey him, accompanied by Charles, whoſe anxiety for
his mother was ſtrongly manifeſted in his heartening and encouraging the
poſtillions. My Lord however was not idle. There were ſeveral towns near at
hand, and each of them boaſted its man-midwife; ſo faſhionable was it
even then, to adopt a cuſtom which the landlord ſwore—as he ſtirred
the kitchen fire to prepare for the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary potations upon this
occaſion—was a diſgrace to the Engliſh nation; a cuſtom to which
our anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who had nerves that, like their bows, twanged with
ſtrength, were utter ſtrangers. He ſaid it was a cuſtom originating
from ſloth and effiminacy; that it was one of thoſe bleſſed
improvements to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the annihilation of manlineſs and becoming decency that
our natural enemies did us the favour to introduce every day; that it was
unmanly and <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1185300302:5"/> ſcandalous as well as ignorant and ridiculous,
for that the moſt experienced practitioner could not poſſibly, from the
nature of the circumſtance, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to any thing comparable to the knowledge
of a woman upon ſuch an occaſion, to whom every poſſible ſymptom
muſt be practically known, and who—which with our landlord was
nine-tenths of his argument—could alone conduct ſuch a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
buſineſs with proper decorum.</p>
               <p>In this temper he ſent for a good old lady, who, he ſaid,
had been obſtetric gentlewoman uſher to half the town, and never had met
with an accident, unleſs from ſuch a combination of natural cauſes as
would have baffled the utmoſt perfection of art.</p>
               <p>The old lady, who reſided in the neighbourhood, arrived
firſt, and Lord Hazard, extremely anxious to procure aſſiſtance, made
no ſcruple of introducing her to his wife.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Ay, ay,' cried the landlord, as he poured her
out a glaſs of uſquebaugh, 'this is as it ſhould be; here, my lord, is an
operator, and pleaſe you, worth a thouſand of your men-midwives; fellows
that I believe would rather have the reputation of getting children than of
bringing them into the world. I once aſked a chap of this ſtamp what 
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1185300302:6"/> made all the children he produced ſo curſed
rickety?—and he anſwered me, with great arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that a man had a
right to mar what he made.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the landlord's rhetoric, he was obliged to
pull in his horns when he underſtood that Lady Hazard's caſe was of ſo
particular a kind that the good old gentlewoman, his friend, could not venture
to proceed in it upon her ſingle judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Being aſked what he ſaid to
this, he replied he was ſtill right:—it happened to be one of thoſe
difficult caſes which required aſſiſtance; but yet the gentleman,
whoever he was, would reap great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from the old woman, who would be able
to explain to him all he had to do, and from a convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being a woman, that
he could not have the ſmalleſt conception of.</p>
               <p>Before morning, arrived three gentlemen, who had been ſent for
from different towns, and preſently afterwards Standfaſt, Charles, and an
eminent man-midwife from London, who, upon all ſuch occaſions, attended her
ladyſhip. A number of corks were heard to report their liberty, and hot wine,
poſſets, and other comfortable drinks ſmoked all over the houſe; yet,
though the landlord was greatly pleaſed at what went forward, when he caſt
his eyes upon the medical tribe, he could not help remarking that 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1185300302:7"/> he did not believe there was half ſo much fuſs when king
ARTHUR was born.</p>
               <p>To the laſt gentleman who arrived, the reſt of courſe gave
way. He immediately viſited Lady Hazard, and ſhortly afterwards found it
neceſſary to have a private converſation with his lordſhip:—nor
will the reader be greatly aſtoniſhed, though very much ſhocked, to hear
that, in the courſe of this conference, it came out that the peculiarity of
Lady Hazard's caſe originated with Miſs Snaffle!</p>
               <p>Lord Hazard's feeling on this occaſion was not ſimply
wretchedneſs, it was horror. Standfaſt was called in, that the whole might
be explained to him; in doing which, my lord uſed ſuch forcible lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
ſo execrated himſelf, and ſo extolled the high, the tranſcendent
friendſhip of the tutor, that the ſurgeon, who was both a ſenſible man
and a valuable member of ſociety, declared he was charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the
circumſtance, and ſhould be very happy to cultivate Mr. Standfaſt's
friendſhip.</p>
               <p>The ſurgeon being now particularly informed of the caſe,
declared that a very diſagreeable operation muſt be performed; but he hoped
the life of Lady Hazard was not in danger. He ſaid he could eaſily give the
matter a turn to the other phyſical gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1185300302:8"/> who, he
could plainly ſee, were ignorant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to a profeſſion in which
they had neither right nor ability to practice; and this, he ſaid, he
conceived materially neceſſary for the ſake of Lady Hazard's peace of
mind, which it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to preſerve if the matter were known
to any but himſelf:—it being a practice with theſe gentry, at which
indeed they are very expert, to injure the domeſtic, as well as the
corporeal, conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Lord Hazard, finding that every thing might be managed without
confiding to his lady the real cauſe of her preſent danger, declared he
would wait the event with patience and reſignation, which turned out as the
ſurgeon had predicted, the child was deſtroyed, but the lady ſurvived the
operation. As to the old woman, ſhe was ſent home as ſoon as
poſſible, for the ſurgeon agreed ſo far with the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, that he
feared much more a diſcovery through her, than through his brother
profeſſors.</p>
               <p>It was nearly ſix weeks before Lady Hazard could be with
ſafety removed; during which time, her kind friend Lady Roebuck ſcarcely
ſtirred from her. Nor was the baronet leſs attentive to my lord. He had
ſet his heart upon ſtimulating that nobleman to an emulation of his own
conduct, when they ſhould arrive in Warwickſhire, and doubted not, as 
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1185300302:9"/> he knew Lady Hazard longed for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
ſo deſirable an end, when he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to his friend how
practicable ſuch a taſk was, and how ſure and immenſe the reward, he
would readily join him in ſo meritorious an exerciſe of that liberality
which Lord Hazard, whatever were his foibles, certainly poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>Pleaſed with theſe ideas, the time rolled inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
on; for as ſoon as Lady Hazard could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, ſhe was, for the
preſent, conveyed to a houſe in the neighbourhood, which her lord had hired
for that purpoſe; and as the company Sir Sidney ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for the ſummer
called, of neceſſity, at the John of Gaunt's Head, in a few days the poet,
painter, and muſician made their appearance, as well as Sir Sidney's
attorney, and a clergyman, all of whom, by invitation, were to paſs the
ſummer at Roebuck hall.</p>
               <p>The aſſembly having now ſo largely increaſed, parties of
pleaſure were planned; and as Lady Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard's health ſeemed every day to be
more confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the general tranquillity was reſtored.</p>
               <p>As to my lord, his reſolution was made, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
irrevocably. Therefore, as no worſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences had happened from his
former conduct, he <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1185300302:10"/> rejoiced at the preſent moment in the
ſame degree as a patient who, by a trifling and immaterial mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation, is
reſtored to health and vigour from the morbid effects of a gangrene.</p>
               <p>The great difficulty with Sir Sidney and Lady Roebuck was how to
proceed as to Standfaſt. It was impoſſible to begin their attack on Lady
Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, as it would ruffle her mind in her preſent weak condition; and as to
my lord, he was ſo wrapped up in his amiable friend, that it would be
impracticable, as well as highly abſurd, to attempt at undeceiving him.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate were matters ſituated when the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman
lately mentioned arrived at the inn. This gentleman, whoſe name was Friend,
had been known to Sir Sidney for many years, and was not the leſs eſteemed
by him for having incurred the diſpleaſure of a biſhop, becauſe he
would not vote againſt his conſcience. He was a very learned, and, what is
a great deal better, a very ſenſible man; for though he had little of that
underſtanding by which men riſe in the world, and which, according to
nine-tenths of mankind, is the only mental coin that ought to paſs current,
yet he had a number of old faſhioned virtues, of no great uſe but to the
owner; but to him valuable indeed:—ſuch as piety, <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1185300302:11"/>
an unſullied conſcience, a benevolent heart, with the addition of a clear
judgment, an inventive ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, and a critical and accurate knowledge of
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern literature.</p>
               <p>As Sir Sidney's was a kind of houſe of call to good characters
out of employ, no wonder this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was ſometimes with him. His viſit
at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, however, was on another account; for the baronet, to tell the
reader the truth, was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes of ſeeing him rector of Little
Hockley. He had been ſome time nominated curate; and, at the death of the
preſent incumbent, the living would be in the gift of Lord Hazard. That this
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which has not been mentioned before, may not appear
extraordinary, I ſhall now explain how it came about.</p>
               <p>When Sir Sidney wrote to Lord Hazard, as we have ſeen,
relative to Little Hockley, he little dreamt that his application would have
produced all the cordiality that now ſubſiſted between them.—On the
contrary, there was more of delicacy than hopes of ſucceſs in conſulting
him at all.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Standfaſt, however, he did not conceive he owed any
ſuch delicacy; and therefore, as the right of nominating a curate reverted to
the rector, <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1185300302:12"/> at the death of Major Malplaquet, diſliking
the bargain and ſale manner in which it had been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted before, he
applied, in the ſtrongeſt poſſible way, to the good paſtor, for the
appointment of Mr. Friend to that ſituation: namely, by making an offer to
commute with him for the entire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the living, at a very handſome
price, and to pay the curate's ſalary out of his own pocket.</p>
               <p>The rector, who could calculate much better than he could
preach, entered into the whole ſpirit of the argument, and Mr. Friend became
to Sir Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, what Mr. Standfaſt had been formerly to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Malplaquet.
This was the reaſon why Mr. Figgins removed to his vicarage, who, officiating
for ſome ſhort time at Little Hockley, while the negociation was pending
between Sir Sidney and the rector, became known to the baronet and Mr. Friend,
both of whom believed him to be a very valuable young man, and Sir Sidney, in
particular, aſſured him that if he could in future be of any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to
him, it would give him pleaſure.</p>
               <p>In a few days after the arrival of Mr. Friend, Standfaſt had
ſo ingratiated himſelf into his good opinion, that the worthy man was
charmed with him. Indeed Standfaſt ſaw plainly that this was a good medium
of recommendation to Sir Sidney, <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1185300302:13"/> whoſe friendſhip, for
ſome reaſon or other, he was ſtrenuouſly deſirous to cultivate.
Perhaps, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence appeared to have reſcued Lord Hazard from his
immediate gripe, he had ſome ſimilar favour in contemplation for the
baronet.</p>
               <p>Certain it is that the damning proof which Sir Sidney and his
lady imagined they had againſt Mr. Standfaſt, which was only preſumptive,
began to ſink before thoſe poſitive proofs which ſeemed every day to
announce his reformation from a number of crimes which he made no ſcruple to
ſay he had formerly committed; and this, added to the tranſport he
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently felt at the reſtoration of that happineſs which now began to
gild the moments of Lord and Lady Hazard, gave this fortunate gentleman ſuch
a favourable place in the hearts of all about him, that really an accuſation
to his prejudice, though ever ſo plauſibly urged, would probably have
gained but little faith, unleſs backed by very weighty, and indeed undeniable
proof againſt him.</p>
               <p>Theſe Sir Sidney really had not. The utmoſt he could alledge
was that diſſipation and thoſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities which Standfaſt
confeſſed and diſclaimed, except indeed a ſtrong ſuſpicion of his
being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in all the buſineſs of Miſs Snaffle, which, if this
recent behaviour was not hypocriſy, amounted <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1185300302:14"/>

nothing, and which was corroborated only by an intercepted letter, and even
that—the reſt not proved—would alſo fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>The proof alluded to was the very letter which Standfaſt
fancied had not been ſent, but, upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiry he found himſelf
miſtaken; yet, as it had made no alteration in Lady Hazard, he was convinced
it had not been properly delivered, and was afterwards confirmed in that
opinion, when he found it had been given to Lady Roebuck's foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>In fact, Lady Roebuck's ſervant, on that very fatal afternoon,
delivered her a letter at Lady Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard's, where ſhe happened to be waiting
for Sir Sidney, who promiſed to meet her there at tea time. Lady Hazard was
luckily writing letters in her own room, and her friend had juſt taken up a
favourite author, from which employ being interrupted by 
<q rend="inline">'a letter for your ladyſhip,'</q> ſhe,
without further ceremony, opened it, and read theſe words: 
<floatingText type="letter">

                        <p> I cannot refrain from acquainting you that your huſband
has an intrigue with an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous woman, and you will be aſſured that I
tell <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1185300302:17"/> you truth, when my intelligence is proved to you by
his ſtaying out the greateſt part of this night. Probably you may gueſs
the quarter from whence you receive this, and as revenge is completely in your
power, why not obey its dictates in favour of one who will not be ungrateful to
your incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable charms?</p>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
               </p>
               <p> Sir Sidney, who came in while ſhe was yet read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, cried
out, 
<q rend="inline">'So, ſo, I have caught you in the fact, have
I? What tender epiſtle have you there?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Only a diſcovery of your tricks, my love,'
ſaid ſhe.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Read that; but, before you ſee a word,
remember I tell you it originates with Mr. Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>As this conduct was no leſs handſome than uſual in Lady
Roebuck, her huſband was neither ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at that nor at the contents
of the letter. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they laughed ſo heartily at it, that their mirth
ſerved only to double their concern when, upon looking at the direction,
which neither of them had noticed before, they ſaw it was addreſſed to
Lady Hazard.</p>
               <p>They were now indeed ſtrongly confirmed it came through Mr.
Standfaſt, and after having inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1185300302:18"/> away Lady
Hazard's time till the lateneſs of the evening convinced them there was too
much truth in the letter, they retired, and, when alone, formed that
determination which we have ſeen ſo reſolutely made at the end of the
firſt volume, and now almoſt abandoned at the very beginning of the
ſecond.</p>
               <p>The latter end of the letter Lady Roebuck thought could allude
to no other than Standfaſt; for though ſhe had heard of the buſineſs of
Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, yet ſhe could not avoid looking upon that to be overſtrained, and
that the tutor at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was the object who wanted to recommend himſelf;
and indeed Lady Hazard, who wiſhed to diſguiſe nothing from her friend,
did not ſcruple to ſay there were times when ſhe had ſimilar
ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, though always, upon reflection, ſhe was convinced ſhe did
him wrong.</p>
               <p>Mr. Standfaſt, being as conſeious of all theſe matters as
if he had known their thoughts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batted the effects of thoſe reſolutions
they had taken in the manner we have ſeen; and thus, though continually on
the brink of a diſcovry, he traverſed the verge of the precipice on which
he was placed as ſecurely, though not ſo harmleſsly, <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1185300302:19"/>
as SHAKESPEARE's peaſant upon Dover cliff; for the peaſant is deſcribed

which I have lately introduced to the reader's notice, it may not be amiſs if
I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a word or two of each in this place.</p>
               <p>The attorney, whoſe name was Balance, had long been a great
favourite of Sir Sidney; not becauſe he had a remarkable number of
enemies—though that was very often a ſufficient reaſon for the
baronet to eſpouſe a man's intereſt—but becauſe he had great
profeſſional integrity and private worth. I ſhall in a moment explain how
this gentleman conjured up ſuch a hoſt of foes, by ſaying that he
mortally hated roguery, though a lawyer. Indeed it had been doubted, by many of
his brother profeſſors, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his odd notions and ſtrange practice did
not ſo decidedly operate againſt that ſtrongeſt of all laws, cuſtom,
to the detriment of the general intereſt, that a point might be made to
ſtrike him off the rolls. <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1185300302:21"/> For, ſaid they, very
learnedly, 
<q rend="inline">'as uſage has, time out of mind, regulated
laws; as uſage has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed that it ſhall be lawful for attornies
to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to themſelves not only the money, goods, and chattles, lands
and tenements, wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, conſciences, peace of mind, nay even the
liberty and lives of their clients; and as this ſaid lawyer Balance
abſolutely rejects in toto, all ſuch general power over his clients,
ſhamefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelf with moderate and reaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
from thoſe in whoſe behalf he has ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and ſcandalouſly
declining to proſecute and purſue to their ruin, ſuch as he plainly
ſees have been already plucked and pillaged, till they totter under the
weight of their accumulated miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes:—quere, whether, by trampling
upon cuſtom, which is paramount to law, and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice and equity
to be the ſame thing, which, for the better promotion of cavils and
arguments, have been conſidered, time immemorial, to have diſtinct and
different meanings, and looked upon as things that ought to be for ever kept
ſeparate and apart, the ſaid lawyer Balance ought not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a heavy
cenſure of the court for the firſt offence, to be ſuſpended during
pleaſure for the ſecond, and if, upon returning to practice, he ſhould be
found infringing this cuſtom, this uſage, this law, this juſtice, this
equity, a third time, then, <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1185300302:22"/> and in that caſe, to be
conſidered as incorrigible, and rendered incapable to practiſe in his
majeſty's courts of juſtice!'</q>
               </p>
               <p>No one of theſe gentlemen, however, being pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot enough to
riſe up and reſcue the laws from the gripe of ſo bold an innovator, he
went on with this illicit practice to the great terror of the petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fogging
tribe—many of whom he had cauſed to be ſtruck off the rolls—and
to the admiration of all good men, and, among the foremoſt, his particular
friend Sir Sidney.</p>
               <p>We come now to the artiſts. Theſe were the ſame who had
viſited Roebuck hall for the laſt three years; for though the baronet had
formerly made a point of having a new ſet every ſeaſon, he at laſt gave
up that plan, finding, upon taking them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately, that he brought
home with him little more than a cargo of vanity, ignorance, and affectation.
Having ſearched, therefore, with great care, and met with three a little more
to his mind, though they certainly were ſtrange kind of oddities, he ſtuck
to them, and being now accuſtomed to their ſingularities, and finding
nothing in them that exceeded folly, they really furniſhed him with a fund of
amuſement, independant of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional abilities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1185300302:23"/> The poet, Mr. Ego by name, was, at leaſt
in his own opinion, as much any thing elſe as a writer. He knew every thing,
and, what is very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, better than any body.</p>
               <p>The painter was a profeſſed ſatiriſt; his talent lay in
caricature; and he blended the ideas which were conveyed by his pencil with his
converſation.</p>
               <p>The muſician was a ſtriking contraſt to the painter; for
he was as remarkably civil, if not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, as the other was ſevere.</p>
               <p>I cannot do better than introduce the reader to them as they are
ſitting over a bottle at the John of Gaunt.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You are a deviliſh ſevere fellow, Mr.
Muſquito,' ſaid the poet to the painter.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I?' ſaid Muſquito; 'not at all:—only
a ſort of a HORACE upon canvaſs, that's all:—a bit of a teazer, or
ſo:—to be ſure I can bite as hard as JUVENAL:—but why ſhould
one torture flies?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'And why not?' cried the poet. 'I would not give
three-pence for a ſatiriſt who could not make any body miſerable.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I'll try my hand upon him,'</q> ſaid the
painter, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing low to the muſician. Then turning to the poet, he went
on. 
<q rend="inline">'Well ſaid Ego! Well ſaid ipſe dixit! 
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1185300302:24"/> Well ſaid I b' itſelf I! Well ſaid proof poſitive!
Well ſaid infallibility!! Upon my ſoul Ego you would have made an admirable

the ſame proportion of excellence compared to others—'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'as you do ſhameleſs effrontery,' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
the poet; 'ſo you ſee I excel you at your own trade; for I have ſaid as
ſevere a thing as ever you did in your life, which has the advantage, unlike
yours, of being truth. I will appeal to Mr. Toogood?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'To him!' ſaid the painter; 'a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
eaſy, fooliſh, good natured—'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Ay, ay,' cried the muſician, 'abuſe my
credulity as much as you pleaſe, but give me credit for my good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at leaſt.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I do, I do,' ſaid Muſquito:—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You intend very well, I dare ſay, when you
praiſe a man's wiſdom, and ſo you do when you praiſe his folly. In
ſhort, in you human nature has ſuch an advocate, that there is ſcarcely a
vice or a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that you have not a commendation for!'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Poor Muſquito,' cried Toogood, 'now upon my
ſoul thy ſhafts muſt be terribly blunt when thou canſt find nothing
better to aim them at than me. I own my ſervices are devoted to all who think
proper to make uſe of them.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'If they are rich,' anſwered Muſquito drily;
'for you know Toogood why ſhould the poor be flattered?'—</q> 
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:1185300302:25"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Plague take you,' ſaid the muſician, 'I was
go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſay that I wiſh to be civil to all mankind, and if I have, in a
few trifling inſtances, been miſtaken, blame nature, who thought fit to
ſow in the garden of life, among a plentiful crop of valuable plants, a
ſlight ſprinkling of raſcals and ſcoundrels. In ſhort, Mr.
Muſquito, I would not give up the luxury of thinking well of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to
have Mexico for my real eſtate, Peru for my perſonal, and the mines of
Golconda for my <hi>menu plaiſirs.</hi> What the devil would you have me
think, as you do, that every eye is divine into my heart, and every hand into
my pocket?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would be worth while, Maſter
Toogood'—cried Muſquito.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Come, come,' ſaid Ego, 'I will finiſh the
diſpute. This is the fact: you, Mr. Muſquito, are over ſuſpicious; and
you, Mr. Toogood, are over credulous. I am the man for this world: I ſteer
the middle courſe.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This company, upon Lady Hazard's recovery, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated into two
parties; one of which ſet off for the ſeat of my lord, and the other for
that of the baronet; till at length, by the ringing of bells and the
acclamations of all the inhabitants, they were welcomed to Little Hockley and
Caſtlewick.</p>
               <p>Sir Sidney threw his eyes complacently around 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1185300302:26"/> him, which ſparkled with the ſatisfaction of
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding ſo many ſincere adherents; and he did not at that moment a
little plume himſelf upon the hope of ſeeing his friend in
poſſeſſion of the ſame ſolid enjoyment.</p>
               <p>The meeting between Sir Sidney's friends and Annette was tender
beyond expreſſion. My lord declared he never ſaw ſo ſweet a creature.
Charles thought her handſome, but babyiſh. His mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ran upon riper
charms, for he had ſo little of the delicacy of love in his compoſition,
that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelf a perfect Caeſar, and having made ſo many
firſt ſight conqueſts, he was yet to learn the pleaſure of
ſolicitation.</p>
               <p>It is a ſhame to talk thus of a boy of eighteen, but really
Mr. Standfaſt had ſo well remembered the converſation that paſſed
between him and Viney, previous to his introduction to Lord Hazard, that the
young gentleman had already experienced the ſecreſy of the very ſame
ſurgeon whoſe cautious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct we were witneſſes of in the laſt
chapter. This gentleman, to ſay the truth, was a perfect HIPPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRATES. As
well as the medical ſkill of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, he poſſeſſed his
prudence; for he ſeemed to adhere to the famous oath of his predeceſſor,
in which he enjoined himſelf to make his patient's <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1185300302:27"/> good
his principal aim, and that whatever he ſaw or heard in the courſe of his
practice, or otherwiſe, relative to the affairs of life, nobody ſhould ever
know, if it ought to remain a ſecret.</p>
               <p>The country and its amuſements had infuſed ſuch pleaſure
and ſatisfaction into every member of this ſociety, that nothing was ſeen
but cheerfulneſs.—They muſtered up a tolerable concert at Sir
Sidney's, a thouſand good humoured ſallies circulated in the way of
impromptues and epigrams, and ſketches of each others ſingularities were
handed about, to the no ſmall diverſion of all but thoſe immediately
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricatured. Charles was pretty adroit in each way, and having a greater
licence, his ſtrokes were bolder, and, in every other reſpect, at leaſt a
match for the reſt. In ſhort, there was no part of their time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by
ſome pleaſure to every perſon's taſte; for it was a maxim with Sir
Sidney that all was fair in which there was no premeditated miſchief. As for
the reſt, Mr. Friend began to experience very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effects from his
efforts at Little Hockley, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as they were ſeconded by the
exhortations of Standfaſt, who they knew had been a great ſinner, and who
now aſſured them that he was become a great penitent.</p>
               <p>Thus, poſſeſſed of every pleaſure a ſmiling
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1185300302:28"/> profuſe liberality, joyful hearts, and
ingenious heads could produce, their happineſs would have been complete had
it not been damped by the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Lady Hazard, who, a ſhort
time after their arrival in the country, evidently fell into a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
decline.</p>
               <p>This, in a great meaſure, prevented Lord Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard from a
participation in the general happineſs, and gave occaſionally no little
uneaſineſs to Sir Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Lady Roebuck. My lord, however, in proportion
as he ſhunned the general hilarity, courted the charms which he found in
private me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and the exerciſe of that benevolence to which he was
ſo forcibly ſtimulated by Sir Sidney.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>MATTERS wore this face when Charles, who had been in continual
anxiety relative to the ſituation of Miſs Figgins, ſaw her brother one
morning ride into the park. It was about the time when the young gentleman
flattered himſelf he ſhould become a father, and having accoſted Mr.
Figgins, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned his ſalutation with bare civility, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
this manly achievement of his had been crowned with the expected ſucceſs.
Relying how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever on the friendſhip of Mr. Standfaſt, he felt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſatisfied than otherwiſe on the ſubject, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appeared as
coldly civil as the young cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Figgins was ſhewn to Mr. Standfaſt, with whom he held a
long conference, the reſult of which our hero waited for with impatience; and
he was not a little aſtoniſhed when the two gentlemen came towards him in
terms of very high altercation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:1185300302:30"/> Charles could diſtinctly hear Standfaſt
ſay 
<q rend="inline">'Come come, this is a little too
raſcally.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Raſcally!' cried the other.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes,' replied Standfaſt, 'for it is
impoſſible that you can be ignorant of her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter:'</q>—and then,
ſeeing Charles, ſaid 
<q rend="inline">'Here is the young gentleman, and I confeſs
his conduct was imprudent enough, but ſir, I tell you once again it was a
trap for him, and if it had not been for my poſitive injunction, ſo
honourable are his ſentiments, he would have diſgraced his family for ever
by marrying your ſiſter, whom I can prove to be a woman void of reputation.
To tell you the truth ſir, this was the cauſe of my ſilence, and as I am
convinced you muſt have been privy to the whole buſineſs, you need not
expect any further countenance from my lord, the biſhop, or any other of my
friends.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Figgins declared that if Mr. Standfaſt could in the
ſmalleſt degree prove what he aſſerted, he ſhould abandon his
ſiſter as a wretch unworthy his protection. He proteſted his total
ignorance of her character, and ſolemnly aſſured Mr. Standfaſt he knew
nothing of the intrigue between her and our hero, till—ſeeing her
palpably in a condition that would ſhortly bring diſgrace on him,
particularly becauſe of his profeſſion and connections—he taxed her
with the fact, and ſhe, with great unwillingneſs, <pb n="31" facs="tcp:1185300302:31"/>
diſcovered to him what had paſſed. He uttered a very florid ſpeech on
the ſubject of ingratitude, and declared he ſhould deteſt himſelf if he
could be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, even was his benefactor—meaning Mr.
Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt—to withdraw his countenance and protection for ever from
him, to meditate any return that could militate againſt thoſe honourable
ſentiments of pure and grateful acknowledgment which were eminently his
due.</p>
               <p>Mr. Standfaſt confeſſed, till this buſineſs, he had
always conſidered him as a very thankful, proper, decent, grateful young
man:—nay he might recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect he had given hints that there would be no
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to count upon his future favour; and really, if he could acquit
himſelf—
<q rend="inline">'Will you ſuffer me to ſpeak?' ſaid
Charles.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'As to Mr. Figgins, I moſt ſincerely beg his
pardon for the irregularity I was guilty of in his houſe. That he ſhould
know any thing of it is morally impoſſible; becauſe his ſiſter told
me that ſhe ſincerely believed he would be the death of her, if he found it
out; and, I aſſure you, this has at times given me ſo much anxiety, that
if I had not promiſed you, Mr. Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, upon my honour—which I
hope will ever be a ſacred pledge with me—to leave the whole to your
diſcretion, I certainly ſhould, long ago, have written to Mr. Figgins, and
laid all the blame on <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1185300302:32"/> myſelf, where it certainly ought
to fall: I am very happy to have this opportunity of coming to ſo proper an

zeal for your honour and that of your noble father has hurried me too far, and
induced me to treat Mr. Figgins with more harſhneſs than he merited. I will

                  <q rend="inline">'Oh yes,' ſaid Standfaſt. 'Come, come,
Charles, you might be a Lubin, but ſhe was no Annette I aſſure you. No,
no, Figgins,' added Standfaſt, taking Charles by the hand, 'my pupil here,
whom <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1185300302:33"/> I hope to ſee a duke, is no match for your
ſiſter, even were there not that bar which I will hereafter convince you
ſubſiſts. In the mean time, let the bantling come forth, and be brought
up:—we will find a proviſion for it.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Figgins was now invited to ſpend a few days in the family,
to which he conſented. Indeed the time paſſed ſo agreeably, that a
fortnight had elapſed before he ever dreamt of taking his leave. Charles,
during this interval, became very intimate with him, and Mr. Friend and the
good Mildman—which laſt declared he began to have hopes of Little
Hockley the moment the young gentleman had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared among them—were
charmed with his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
               <p>Nor muſt the reader, who knows his origin, too haſtily
credit that I am advancing any thing unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or unlikely. Art does not
require brilliant talents, and no people in the world are ſo eaſily
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon as good men. Pay but a modeſt deference to your own opinion,
that you may not ſeem too ſervile; ſtruggle a little with conviction
before you appear to yield to it; and, though you give up points with
reluctance, never fail in the end to crown your adverſary with the palm of
victory:—<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1185300302:34"/> and be aſſured of friends wherever you
chooſe to make them.</p>
               <p>Standfaſt knew mankind ſurely. This young man was bred up
under him; and as he had ſtrong intellects, rather an engaging figure, a
retentive memory, a wonderful natural penetration, a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and ſhrewd
ſagacity, with a fortunate knack of chequering his converſation with bits
and ſcraps of philoſophy and morality, which he had ſtudied, it is not at
all aſtoniſhing that he ſhould be miſtaken for a ſenſible and good
man by ſuch as, could they have diſcovered any defects in him, would rather
have excuſed than expoſed them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Standfaſt, one day, having received ſome letters from
London, came to my lord, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him that his uncle was at the point of
death. Of this uncle Lord Hazard had heard him ſpeak, and always underſtood
he had great expectations from him. He therefore begged that no time might be
loſt, but that the tutor ſhould inſtantly ſet out to ſee his
relation. This was the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily agreed to becauſe Mr. Figgins could
ſtay to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintend his pupil's ſtudies, which indeed now conſiſted
of nothing more than reading and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring different authors, a part of which
exerciſe <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1185300302:35"/> he pleaſures of the country took off; not to
reckon nis attention to painting and muſic, in both of which he was a great
proficient.</p>
               <p>Theſe preliminaries adjuſted, Mr. Standfaſt took his leave
of his good friends in Warwickſhire, and repaired to London; from whence, in
a ſhort time afterwards, he informed Lord Hazard that, his uncle being dead,
he was left independant; but that he ſhould ſtill conſider him as his
benefactor, and would, as ſoon as he ſhould have ſettled his affairs,
wait on him. He anxiouſly enquired after Lady Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, whom he had left in a
very declining ſtate of health; hoped his pupil was pleaſed with Figgins,
whom he took the liberty to recommend as his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, while he ſhould need a
perſon in that capacity, and offered to relinquiſh in his favour that
annuity which his lordſhip had ſettled on him for life.</p>
               <p>My lord replied in a ſuitable manner to this letter. He
wiſhed his friend joy of his good fortune; drew a melancholy picture of Lady
Hazard's ſituation; enlarged moſt pathetically on his own treatment of her;
ſolemnly declared if he ſhould loſe her all his happineſs would be at
an end; conſented with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to his propoſal concerning Figgins, but
poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively refuſed—though he was determined to take care of the
young man—to ſuffer the ſmalleſt reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1185300302:36"/> of that which he, Standfaſt, had infinitely more than
deſerved:—winding up the whole with a ſtrong contraſt between the
great and exalted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his friend, and his own unworthineſs.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the ſummer was gliding away, during which
ſcarcely a day paſſed that did not bring with it ſome new pleaſure;
but yet Lady Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard's indiſpoſition was a cloud that dimmed this ſerene
ſky. As moſt of theſe amuſements however were calculated for the
alleviation of her pain, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe which Charles
conducted—for he doated on his mother—their enjoyments ſuffered
but little diminution on her account. In the mean time our hero's ſentiments
changed inſenſibly every day in favour of Annette, though really his heart
was yet a perfect ſtranger to the delicious ſenſations of delicate love;
and thoſe he did feel, young as he was, upon ſo proper an occaſion he
well knew how to ſuppreſs. He had ſome warm thoughts cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as to
Emma, and knowing as much of books as herſelf, he very archly conceived a
deſign of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering her with her own weapons; but, finding her virtue too
well fortified to yield to his ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he made an honourable retreat,
greatly to her ſatisfaction, who was not in the leaſt angry; for virtue,
with her, was ſlender indeed that could not withſtand every trial. On the
contrary, ſhe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1185300302:37"/> to predict that Annette was his
deſtined wife, but foreſaw his imprudence would coſt many a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual heart
ach before the accompliſhment of their deſtiny.</p>
               <p>Charles certainly had not the ſmalleſt objection to
conſider Annette in the light of an intended wife, nor was he by any means,
as I have already ſaid, inſenſible to either her beauty or
accompliſhments; and therefore—eſpecially as he had the ſanction of
both his and her parents—he paid her the exacteſt attention, and loſt
no method nor opportunity of inſpiring her with ſentiments highly to his
advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But he had ever ſet his heart on ſeeing the world, and that not
ſuperficially, before he ſhould ſink into a domeſtic character, which
he always conceived would be a clog to the exertions of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile mind, like
his; unleſs he could be aſſured, by repeated experience, that his partner
for life was poſſeſſed of thoſe many and ſcarce attractions which
would ſo bind his inclinations as to make him prefer bondage to liberty.</p>
               <p>The attention he paid Annette had, however, a different effect
on that young lady. Their little pleaſures were, it is true, not more than
the ſports of children; but there was ſuch an unaffected eaſe, ſuch
ſweetneſs of temper, ſuch an engaging and ſo <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1185300302:38"/>
inſinuating an addreſs in our hero, without the ſmalleſt tincture of
art, or illiberality, that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her own knowledge, ſhe imbibed the
ſeeds of that poiſon which, according to Emma's predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was deſtined
to give her many a bitter pang.</p>
               <p>Little Hockley was now improving very faſt.—Mr. Balance
had routed the two attornies I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſpoke of, who, upon examination,
were found to have practiſed without the ſmalleſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The
painter had completed a picture of the return of the prodigal ſon, which was
placed in a conſpicuous part of the church, and the muſician had opened a
fine organ, the gift of Sir Sidney, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the poet affixed a very
elegant latin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, which Emma ſaid ought to have been in
Engliſh.</p>
               <p>It had been an invariable cuſtom to celebrate the baronet's
birth-day by throwing open the doors of the manſion houſe, and feaſting
all comers. In the afternoon ſeveral ſports were performed on the green,
and, in the evening, the company retired to a very large ruſtic
aſſembly-room, where Sir Sidney always opened the ball; and after he had
ſeen that his tenants and neighbours had every thing they could wiſh for,
to give their pleaſure free ſcope, he <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1185300302:39"/> retired with
their warm and unfeigned good wiſhes for a continuance of his health and
happineſs.</p>
               <p>Since Sir Sidney's marriage, however, this feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val had been
kept on his wedding day, and this was called the grand feaſt:—for there
were three others to celebrate, the birth-day of himſelf, that of Lady
Sidney, and that of Annette. But theſe happening near each other, and Sir
Sidney not chooſing to fill his tenants heads with too profuſe an
inclination for pleaſure, he held theſe feſtivals on the four quarter
days, when he never failed to lighten the hearts of thoſe who, from
unavoidable neceſſity, could not be punctual with their rent.</p>
               <p>There was ſomething ſo remarkable in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the day
which united the two villages, that I ſhall take a freſh chapter to
deſcribe it: flattering myſelf that no one will blame me for dwelling upon
a ſubject the fitteſt that can be to produce benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ideas.</p>

                  <p> The company is expected to arrive on Sunday evening, and not to
depart till Tueſday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The combined aſſiſtance of all who could be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was
ſolicited upon this occaſion. The poet, painter, and muſician produced a
maſque in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and Charles wrote and ſet an ode, as 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1185300302:41"/> well as painted the decorations for it; and it was
allowed—though that might be the company's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality—to be the
completeſt performance of the day.</p>
               <p>Lord Hazard's department was to receive the company, and
accommodate ſuch as could not find room at Sir Sidney's. Charles had the
manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the amuſements, and Mr. Friend, aſſiſted by Mildman and
Figgins, undertook to preſerve decency and decorum. The company which
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the Sunday evening were ſerved in the apartments provided for
them, and permitted to ſup and retire at their own time.</p>
               <p>At ſix o'clock on the Monday morning, the two villages were
awoke by ringing of bells, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of cannon, and other demonſtrations
of joy. This done, ſeveral meſſengers were diſpatched to requeſt
their attendance at a rural amphitheatre fitted up for the purpoſe, in the
front of the rookery. There, by eight o'clock, the company aſſembled; and,
after a ſhort but pathetic hymn to the deity, had breakfaſt ſerved up to
them by children, in white and fleſh-colour dreſſes, ornamented with
flowers, who drew the moſt delicious beverages from a variety of urns,
diſtributed about in niches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:1185300302:42"/> Coffee, tea, and chocolate, were relieved
by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilaire, orgeat, lemonade, and ſherbet; while the moſt odoriferous
perfumes mingled their artificial ſweets with the roſes and jeſſamine,
that ſhed their emanations as they interlaced the ſurrounding treil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.
Cakes, comfits, and liqueurs, were ſeen in great variety and abundance; and
after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had amply refreſhed themſelves, during a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of
the moſt touching and melting airs, each Ganemede and Hebe moved a ſpring,
and inſtantly played in the centre of every alcove a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of roſe
water, for the uſe of ablution; which ceremony was ſucceeded by a
proclamation, that every one was at liberty to take ſeparate diverſion till
eleven o'clock, when they were expected on the lawn, in order to go to church
in proceſſion.</p>
               <p>This proceſſion, though ſimple, was ſtriking. It was
preceded by twenty-four wool-combers, each of whom carried ſome ornament of
their profeſſion. Twelve others followed, with banners, on which were
diſplayed a variety of ingenious devices.—Twenty-five inhabitants of
Caſtlewick, and as many of Little Hockley, ſucceeded, one of each place
linked arm in arm, in token of brotherly love. To theſe ſucceeded a band of
muſic:—then came the ſtewards with golden wands, who were followed by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1185300302:43"/> their aſſiſtants with ſilver ones. Lady Roebuck,
Lady Hazard, and Annette came next, in an open carriage: theſe were
ſucceeded by a large number of other carriages, and theſe again by about
two thouſand ſpectators.</p>
               <p> Being orderly ſeated at church, the ſervice was performed,
and an excellent ſermon preached by Mr. Mildman, from the text 
<q rend="inline">'There is more joy in heaven over one ſinner
that repenteth, than over ninety and nine juſt perſons, who need no
repentance.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſervice over, they returned in the ſame
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der—with this difference:—twelve morrice dancers met them on
their way, and conducted them in a mazy round to the lawn, where all
diſperſed, and, after promiſcuous ambulations about the garden, retired
to dreſs for dinner, which, at three o'clock, ſmoaked in the grand
ſaloon, for the company within doors, and on the lawn for all who choſe to
partake of it.</p>
               <p>In the ſaloon Lady Roebuck held her ſtate, and Sir Sidney
played the humble hoſt. Annette, on one ſide, ſat with all the blooming
freſhneſs of a new blown roſe; and, on the other, poor Lady Hazard,
pallid as a drooping lily. On the table <pb n="44" facs="tcp:1185300302:44"/> was elegantly
diſtributed a moſt ſumptuous feaſt, admirably contraſted, and
delicately ſerved up. Nor did their pleaſure receive a ſmall addition
from the hearty vacant mirth that aſſailed them from the lawn—which
the ſaloon overlooked—where ſat as many happy gueſts as could
ſurround an ox, two bucks, and four ſheep, all roaſted whole; at which
Emma ſat in imitation of Lady Roebuck, and the butler—who was the very
ſervant ſo faithful to Sir Sidney in France—attended, like his
maſter, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the wants of the company.</p>
               <p>Many loyal toaſts were proclaimed by a diſcharge of cannon,
and pledged by the company without. At length the lawn was cleared, coffee
introduced into the ſaloon, and, in a ſhort time after, notice given that
the ode written by our hero was going to be performed in the ruſtic
amphitheatre, where the company had breakfaſted.</p>
               <p>The ſaloon was now prepared for the maſque, to which the
company were deſired to repair in fancy dreſſes, but without vizors.
Previous however to the performance, as ſoon as it became ſufficiently
dark, they were led by the morrice dancers through a ſerpentine walk to the
canal, where, on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite bank, was diſcharged a moſt ſuperb
firework, in which the painter had exerted himſelf in orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental 
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1185300302:45"/> tranſparencies, and the poet in apt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
               <p>The maſque over, it is impoſſible to expreſs the
univerſal aſtoniſhment when, upon returning to the lawn, they found it
converted into beautiful alcoves, tents, booths, and other receptacles for
different par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, where boys and girls, in the moſt pictureſque fancy
dreſſes, ran before them, ready to anticipate their very wiſhes. Nothing
could exceed the beauty proportion, and diſpoſition of this city of the
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, reared as it were by enchantment. Thoſe who were not
diſpoſed, however, to reſort to it for refreſhment, were attended and
ſerved in a manner equally deſirable in a ſuite of rooms in the houſe;
and as to Emma's company, in addition to a review of all theſe pleaſures at
a becoming diſtance, they had their own rural aſſembly room for their
ſupper and ball, where I am well informed not one, within ſome hours,
gueſſed what it was o'clock, till the ſun ſent forth thoſe ſtreaks
of crimſon which put an end to their harmleſs merriment on the Tueſday
morning.</p>
               <p>Nor did their ſuperiors ſeparate one whit ſooner, and not
then without regretting that their pleaſures were at an end, and declaring
that they never wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed ſuch taſte, nor experienced ſuch
hoſpitality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1185300302:46"/> It may not be improper to notice ſome of the
principal remarks made on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>Annette remarked that Charles looked, ſpoke, and did every
thing divinely. He remarked that ſhe was a lovely little creature; and all
the company remarked that they ſeemed born for each other.—Emma
remarked ſhe had made a conqueſt of the poet, the muſician, and the
butler; and well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fidelity of this laſt to his maſter, and
affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his young miſtreſs, declared, as ſhe undreſſed Annette,
that ſhe ſhould have no objection, at a proper ſeaſon, to be the author
of his happineſs.</p>
               <p>The poet remarked Emma was a ſmart wench, and ſhould be his;
for he was the man in the world for her purpoſe. The muſician agreed to the
firſt remark, but thought they neither of them ſtood any chance; and the
painter, overhearing them, ſwore ſhe was a caricature of mother Shipton,
and they were damned fools for talking ſuch nonſenſe.</p>
               <p>Lord Hazard remarked that he had now but one wiſh in the
world; and Sir Sidney remarked—but not to my lord, that this was the
firſt time their grand feaſt had been graced with the preſence of Lady
Hazard, and he greatly feared it would be the laſt. Indeed that amiable and
charming lady, <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1185300302:47"/> leſt ſhe ſhould diminiſh the
general hilarity, exerted herſelf on that day beyond her ſtrength, and
though probably the utmoſt human care—for ſhe had every
aſſiſtance that money or influence could procure—could not have
wholly reſtored her, yet, certainly, her now rapid decline was accelerated by
the various ſhocks, though of temporary pleaſure, which ſhe received in
aſſiſting to promote the happineſs of her friends.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A DISPUTE BETWEEN EMMA AND THE POET.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>As this is the only entire ſummer the reader and I are to
paſs in Warwickſhire, I ſhall explain pretty fully how the time jogged
on. So far it is pretty evident every man's leiſure had been taken up to
prepare for the feſtival, which ſome may think I have a little too
particularly deſcribed. It has, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, brought about ſomething,
according to my uſual cuſtom; for it made Lady Hazard worſe, which, but
for the ſake of moral truth, I ſincerely wiſh had not happened; it loſt
Emma's heart; and it did two or three other things, which will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged in
proper time.</p>
               <p>This grand affair being over, the ſpare time was filled up
with lighter and leſs regular pleaſures; among which Charles, in
particular, found the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſpoſitions of Sir Sidney's ſcientific
trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate excellent food for his frolickſome temper, which, though it had
not the ſmalleſt tincture of <pb n="49" facs="tcp:1185300302:49"/> miſchief in it, loved
to indulge itſelf with expoſing abſurdity. To this Maſter Figgins egged
him on with all his perſuaſion, with no view, however, as he ſaid, but to
oblige the young gentleman; nor, to ſay the truth, did Sir Sidney want a
reliſh for ſuch fun, when every thing was kept within proper decorum.</p>
               <p>It did not ſignify what the joke was, their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it
produced all the amuſement. Charles very often ſet the poet down to a
literary contention with Emma, who, being ſkilled in authorities, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
conquered him; for really dates and facts are very good materials for
criticiſm, and method will very often be too hard for genius. Upon theſe
occaſions the poet was thruſt further into a corner by the ſatiric
painter, and conſoled by the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating muſician. One afternoon,
however, ſhe gained ſo complete a triumph, that he was obliged, for a long
time, to own himſelf conquered.</p>
               <p>The reader remembers that Emma had a very great predelection for
Dr. JOHNSON, and Charles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the poet to attack the lexicographer. This
he did not fail to do, but kept, for a long time, to general accuſations.
Emma deſired he would give her ſome opportunity of anſwering him. 
<q rend="inline">'Any <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1185300302:50"/> man,' ſaid ſhe,
'may be made to look contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. ARISTOPHANES contrived this of SOCRATES,
who, becauſe he was a man of inoffenſive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and therefore naturally
decried the licentious writings and conduct of the comic poets, provoked the
fury of this ſatiriſt:—but even though this is true, and though
Madame DACIER was ſo charmed with this author that ſhe
tranſlated—and, not content with that, read two hundred times, and
every time with freſh pleaſure, the very piece that was written to render
this great philoſopher ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous—yet it proved nothing, becauſe
general aſſertion is a blunt arrow that falls without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting a

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well, what do you ſay to this?' cried
Figgins, who ſtood by.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Say!' cried the poet, 'If ſhe wants proofs of

proofs. And firſt of all, has he not written a ſevere ſatire on

<q rend="inline">"he predominated over his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions with a
very high aſcendency, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly would bear none over whom he could not

ſhe had ſurfeited herſelf with an <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1185300302:51"/> abject and
indefatigable attention to him for a number of years, ſuch as no man who did
not in a moſt inſolent degree predominate over his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions could exact,
does ſhe not declare ſhe could no longer bear him, and that ſhe went to
Bath becauſe ſhe knew he would not follow her? Is not Mr. BOSWELL every

come, you ſhall have him as a poet. And pray, does he not wiſh to deſtroy
the very being of poetry, by inſiſting on annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating mythology? Does he
not find it very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible in Mr. GAY to introduce Cloacina and the
nightman in his Trivia? and does he not abuſe poor PRIOR moſt unmercifully
for fabling that <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1185300302:52"/> Chloe was miſtaken one day by Cupid for
Venus, and another for Diana? In ſhort, mythology is, with him, puerility. He
ſays of Collins that he loved faries, genii, giants, and monſters! and that
while he purſued theſe objects, he did not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently cultivate
ſentiment: when all the world knows that there is an end of poetry if
ſentiment is no longer to be conveyed through ſo rich and beautiful a
vehicle. What do you ſay to this abuſe of the gods and goddeſſes? Is
not it ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'Another evaſion,' cried the poet, 'I will be
judged by any body. But I will go a plainer way to work. Here is a criticiſm
of his that is ſtark nonſenſe. In ſpeaking of Mr. GRAY's lines on the
death of a cat that was drowned as ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to catch a gold fiſh, the
laſt line ſays, that all that glitters is not gold; nor if it were, ſays
the doctor, would the cat have been the better for it, for a cat does not know
the value of gold. Now I ſay ſhe does, in the ſenſe it is here meant,
which is nothing more than that we are not to truſt to appearances; and a cat
knows that, as far as her <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1185300302:53"/> underſtanding goes, as well as
a man. Can you controvert this, Mrs. Emma? No, no, I am the man for cloſe
reaſoning. All that glitters is not gold ſure enough. What do you ſay to
my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'That it is not ſterling, ſir,' ſaid
Emma.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Your learned principal would have given the

                  <q rend="inline">'Come, come, why does he take no more notice of
COLLINS's ode than if no ſuch poem had ever been written? Can you anſwer me
that?</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Eaſily, ſir,' ſaid Emma; 'it was written
for muſic, which he did not underſtand.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'It is a pity then,' ſaid the poet, 'that he
did not underſtand it; for he cannot ſhew ſuch harmony in his own poetry,
which is the heavieſt—'</q>

<q rend="inline">'Zounds,' cried the poet, 'you would make a man

               <p>Here every body interfered, and it was univerſally allowed
that Emma had gained a complete victory. 
<q rend="inline">'Yes,' ſaid Emma, ſtill imitating Dr.

                  <p>CONSISTING OF SHAM GHOSTS, AND A VALIANT TAYLOR.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING this repulſe which the poet ſuſtained from
Emma, he had really a penchant for her, and as ſhe loved reading, he
flattered himſelf he ſhould ſucceed by acknowledging her victory over him
in the diſpute already mentioned, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tacitly to her opinion in
all literary matters.</p>
               <p>This amorous intercourſe, at leaſt that which appeared ſo
to the muſician, began to make him a little uneaſy, for he flattered
himſelf with pretty near the ſame hopes as the poet. Seeing this, Charles
and his aſſociates hit upon a plan which they thought would afford them
ſome amuſement.</p>
               <p>Charles very archly intimated to Toogood that Emma, in her own
mind, gave him the preference, but, added he, you will loſe her owing to your
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd diffidence. In ſhort, after proper preparatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> he propoſed to him a ſcheme which he ſaid would

                  <gap reason="duplicate" resp="#OXF" extent="1 page">

                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1185300302:58"/> evince his love for Emma, even without wounding his modeſty by
declaring it, would bring out her real ſentiments towards him, and would
finally frighten Ego into a relinquiſhment of his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to her.</p>
               <p>The kind Mr. Toogood agreed to the propoſal with but little
heſitation. It was this: the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates were to report that the
muſician had hanged himſelf for love, and, to give it a colour, while he
hid himſelf in a garret—where, by the way, they almoſt ſtarved him,
under a pretence that nobody could come to him for fear of a
diſcovery—his fian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel powdering gown was put upon a ſtuffed figure,
and hung as it were artfully by the neck to a ſtaple in his bed chamber; and
this was ſhewn to the poet, in the duſk of the evening, in a way ſo well
managed, that he really took it for the muſician.</p>
               <p>The poet, willingly enough, ran, as he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, for help,
and, in the interim, the powdering gown was ſhifted from the figure to
Toogood him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whoſe face had previouſly been ſmeared by the painter
with a compoſition of a cadaverous hue; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he returned, and
found Toogood ſtretched upon the bed, he had not the ſmalleſt doubt but
that he had made his final exit. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently afterwards Emma came into the
room, and <pb n="57" facs="tcp:1185300302:59"/> being properly inſtructed for the purpoſe,
began to lament her hard fate, and to utter ſo many tender things in favour
of the muſician—calling him her Orpheus, her Amphion!—In ſhort
ſhe flew into ſuch apparent rapture, that Charles and Figgins feared the
crotchet-monger would have jumped up, and appeaſed her upon the ſpot. She
ſaid this country was now deprived of a ſecond PURCEL, but where could they
find another DRYDEN to record his praiſe?</p>
               <p>Ego anſwered briſkly, that DRYDEN to be ſure was a very
pretty poet, but there was one yet in the world, he flattered himſelf, as
capable of ſinging the virtues of a deceaſed friend as moſt people.</p>
               <p>Emma took him at his word, ſaying ſhe feared ſhe ſhould
never be able to bring herſelf to love him—though ſhe would try what
ſhe could do—yet her friendſhip he might always command, if he would,
as a laſt tribute to his friend's memory, write his epitaph.</p>
               <p>This ſettled, the company diſperſed. Charles lifted up his
hands, Figgins bleſſed himſelf, the poet in profound meditation,
Muſquito ſwearing it ſerved the fool right, and Emma quite in a tragedy
rant: The poet deſired he might have a ſlight ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <pb n="58" facs="tcp:1185300302:60"/> in his apartment, and pen, ink, and paper.—The muſician, who
had acted his part very well, was locked up, and every body retired.</p>
               <p>Ego was heard for ſome time to walk about his room in great
agitation, and afterwards to draw his chair and ſit down very ſtill to
work. In ſhort, he had finiſhed the taſk juſt at that moment 
<q> 
                     <l>'When church yards yawn,</l> 
                     <l>'And hell itſelf breaths forth contagion to the
world!'</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Being charmed with his production, he began to read it aloud,
and afterwards was heard to exclaim, 
<q rend="inline">'I never was ſo ſucceſsful in my life!
Once more—'</q>and then reading—
<q> 
                     <l>'Here Toogood lies, by deſp'rate paſſion
<hi>drove,</hi>
                     </l> 
                     <l>'Who, great muſician, hanged himſelf for
love!'</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſcarcely had uttered theſe words, when open flew the
door, and the muſician appeared in his powdering gown, with a halter round
his neck, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming in a hollow voice 
<q rend="inline">'And ſo I did, perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous poet.'</q> The
bard, like Pierrot—though the muſician looked that character more than
he did—now began to ſtare, to tremble, and, without quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either the
paper or the candle, blundered to the further ſide of the bed, where the
ghoſt, with a moſt <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1185300302:61"/> ghaſtly grin, glided after him.
Seeing himſelf fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, he ſprang acroſs the bed at the expence of his
ſhins, and out of the door, the ghoſt hard at his heels, when hurrying down
the ſtairs—which were ſtrewed with peas, unknown to either of them,
they rolled over each other till they lighted on a feather bed, purpoſely
laid at the landing place, where all the company in the houſe burſt in at
once, and found them cuffing one another almoſt as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully as Mr. POPE
makes the two eagles in HOMER.</p>
               <p>The muſician began now to perceive that he had been duped as
well as the poet. Sir Sidney ſaid he was ſorry to find the muſician had
played upon ſo ridiculous a chord; to which Charles anſwered, his
performance was perfectly in the amoroſo ſtyle.—Emma ſaid that to
be ſure he had given a dying proof of his love, but not knowing that he would
recover, ſhe, out of deſpair, had choſen another.—The painter
ſaid it was not the firſt time Mr. Too-good had made himſelf ridiculous.
The poor mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, getting up, laughed the matter off as well as he could.
He ſaid his known character was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himſelf, as much as
poſſible, to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the company; and as to the poet, he ſaid
he ſuſpected it was a trick from the beginning, for he was the man at
diſcoveries! He ſwore he would <pb n="60" facs="tcp:1185300302:62"/> have acted a dead man
ten times better; and as for a ghoſt! 
<q rend="inline">'Damme,' ſaid he, 'if I had perſonated a
ghoſt, I would have ſcared you all out of your wits!'</q>
               </p>
               <p>After a hearty laugh, Emma finiſhed the buſineſs by a few
ſerious words, ſaying, that they had both hung themſelves up as marks of
ingratitude, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for Sir Sidney's hoſpitality; yet, if the ghoſt of
remorſe did but haunt them a little, for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a wiſh to injure a
poor girl, who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to depend upon but her character, ſhe ſhould,
for her own part, think them ſufficiently puniſhed.</p>
               <p>A truce was ſtruck, and good humour reſtored, or rather
prolonged; for none of the parties enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the leaſt rancour: on the
contrary, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician was the firſt to confeſs he had been juſtly
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for his error, and Ego ſaid he was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of poetical
juſtice, which he flattered himſelf he had exemplified pretty ſtrongly in
his writings.</p>
               <p>About this time a matter happened which had very nearly undone
ſome of Sir Sidney's pious work at Little Hockley. One John Swaſh, a
miller, who was at the head of a large family, and one of the firſt who
repented of his former idle tricks, had been ſet up by Sir Sidney, and had
lived for ſome <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1185300302:63"/> time in comfort and credit. This man, at
the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of ſome litigious perſons, who envied his preſent good
fortune, had been taken up for ſheep-ſtealing: a crime which he certainly
had committed ſome years before. He was to be tried at Warwick, at the
ſummer aſſizes, and Sir Sidney greatly feared the fact would be fully
proved; in which caſe, it would be difficult to ſave the man.</p>
               <p>But this was not the worſt, for a number of the Hockleyites,
having been guilty of crimes equally enormous, might, on his conviction,
emigrate from the village, where they began to live peaceable and decent lives;
and thus he ſhould loſe the fruits of that benevolent harveſt which he
had been ſo long and ſo carefully bringing to perfection.</p>
               <p>There was but one man who could ſwear to his identity; except
indeed a companion, who having been formerly diſcharged by a magiſtrate, on
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this fact, now appeared as king's evidence, to curry favour with
the farmer, whoſe ſheep had been loſt, as well as to ſcreen himſelf
from future proſecutions.</p>
               <p>This man, who, as I ſaid, could ſwear to him, was a taylor,
and lived, at this time, in pretty good credit at Wellingborough, but had
formerly worked <pb n="62" facs="tcp:1185300302:64"/> as journeyman at a ſmall town not far
from Little Hockley, and when buſineſs was not very ſtiring there, was
glad enough to job about at other places, and return to his wife and family
with the earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>He had been three days getting ready ſome mourning for a
family in the neighbourhood, when, being upon the point of returning on a very
dark night, he was reminded, by ſome officious friend, that he muſt go
ſeven miles about, for that over the common, which was but little more than
three, he would certainly meet with the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>It muſt be underſtood that on this common was erected a
gibbet, where were hung in chains two ſmugglers, who had murdered an
exciſeman; and under this gibbet every evening were ſeen—for a great
number of the inhabitants within ſome diſtance round were ready to ſwear
it—two men in white marching with much deliberation, and carrying a
coffin.</p>
               <p>The taylor had frequently heard all this, but as it rained a
little, and the way over the common lay ſo much nearer than the other, he
could not think or going round:—beſides he was perfectly, at this 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1185300302:65"/> time, pot valiant, and one more glaſs put the
finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtroke to his reſolution.</p>
               <p>Away went the taylor with his wages in his pocket, and his
gooſe ſuſpended on a ſtick, which he held over his ſhoulder. When he
came near the gibbet, ſure enough he ſaw two men carrying a coffin. His
ſenſations may be eaſily gueſſed at. He was ſeized with ſo
ſtrong a fit of horror, that his teeth chattered, his legs ſhook, he
trembled from head to foot, and ſweat at every pore. He made an effort to run
away, but his limbs refuſed their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. At length, as the ſpectre
approached, with one frantic ſtruggle, between fear and deſperation, his
well-poiſed gooſe flew from the ſtaff that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it like
lightning, and hitting the head of the ghoſt that was neareſt to him,
brought him to the ground—when lo! open flew the coffin, and out jumped
two ſheep!</p>
               <p>The other ſpirit, unconſcious that he had only one-ninth of
an adverſary to encounter, took to his heels, and ſoon diſappeared. The
firſt, however, ſtunned by the blow he had received, could not ſo
eaſily get out of the taylor's clutches, who being convinced of the fact by
the information of the two ſheep, purſued his victory, and actually tied
the <pb n="64" facs="tcp:1185300302:66"/> culprits hands with a large piece of liſt, in order
to carry him before a magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>The ſheepſtealer pleaded very hard for his liberty as ſoon
as he came to himſelf, when the taylor, knowing his voice, preſently
recognized him for the very ſame John Swaſh, who now, at the diſtance of
almoſt three years, was confined in Warwick jail for this individual
offence.</p>
               <p>The general opinion was that the taylor had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionated
the ſituation of John for a valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which was, in the
nature of a fine, to be paid by inſtallments, but had not been regularly
diſcharged. Finding however that the offender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be pretty well off in
the world, the ſubject was revived, and the matter carried by the farmer, at
the inſtigation of the taylor, to the length we have ſeen.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the circumſtances which made Sir Sidney uneaſy.
He plainly ſaw that Swaſh was picked out not with a view to offer a public
ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at the ſhrine of offended juſtice, but merely to be uſed as
an inſtrument by way of experiment, to ſee how much money could, upon
ſimilar occaſions, be extorted in future:—for knowing the baronet to 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1185300302:67"/> be very warm in whatever he eſpouſed, the two
pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſoggers who were driven from Little Hockley, and a few others who
accompanied them, counted upon a comfortable ſubſiſtence, which they had
no doubt they could procure by raiſing contributions, in like manner, upon
the generoſity of Sir Sidney.</p>

                  <p>THE SEQUEL OF SWASH AND THE TAYLOR.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>The difficulty ſeemed to be how to ſuppreſs the evidence
of the taylor without Sir Sidney's apparent concurrence; for it was not enough
that he ſhould not ſeem to take any active part in the buſineſs, but it
was neceſſary to regard it as a matter of perfect indifference to him.</p>
               <p>On this account, it was neceſſary to be very wary in their
meaſures. Charles and Figgins, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, undertook, after a very little
reflection, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all difficulties.</p>
               <p>The plan was explained, and greatly approved; and now came the
time to put it in execution.</p>
               <p>A houſe was taken about three miles from War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, whither
Charles, Figgins, and the body of arts repaired; which laſt were informed
that the <pb n="67" facs="tcp:1185300302:69"/> removal was only temporary, to take views, and
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the aſſemblies at the aſſizes.</p>
               <p>About a month before the aſſizes, Charles and Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins rode
to Wellingborough. The latter having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly rolled his coat in the road,
and ſplaſhed his horſe on one ſide, they went to the firſt inn they
ſaw, where they enquired if there was a clever tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor in town, who could
make a coat at a ſhort warning. The landlord recommended one, but not the man
they wanted; but, rather than make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, they determined to ſee him,
and when he came found fault with every thing he produced: which indeed they
were determined to do with fifty, till they ſhould ſee the object of their
preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. At length he came, and there never was ſuch a
taylor! They were ſtruck with his taſte, his manner, his price:—In
ſhort, the poor devil was in raptures, though a man muſt have been very
ingenious to find language for this laviſh praiſe in favour of a card of
buttons, and ſome ſnips of cloth. So it was however, that the taylor never
found out half ſo much merit in himſelf as at that moment. He made his men
ſit up all night, and a very awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward coat was produced in the morning for
Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, which, nevertheleſs, was the pink of taſte, and the extreme of
the new faſhion; and Charles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſo much in love with it, that
he ordered <pb n="68" facs="tcp:1185300302:70"/> a frock for himſelf, with the addition of a
new Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham button, with which he declared himſelf enchanted. This frock
however he could not ſtay for. It was therefore ordered to be ſent to the
houſe of the Rev. Mr. Figgins, near Warwick, where it would be paid for on
delivery.</p>
               <p>The taylor ſaid he ſhould be at Warwick at the aſſizes,
for he was ſubpoened there upon a trial, and he would then, if the gentleman
pleaſed, take the liberty of calling, to ſee if he was ſatisfied with his
coat.</p>
               <p>Figgins ſaid he ſhould be very glad to ſee him, for that
he knew no character ſo reſpectable as a tradeſman. This was ſaid as
they took horſe, and the taylor, making a very low bow, retired. The
circumſtance was however ſo ſingular, that the landlord, as well as the
taylor's wife, ſet down Charles and Figgins for two cheats, and cautioned the
taylor not to be taken in.</p>
               <p>The taylor had himſelf ſome ſuſpicions akin to theirs,
though the flattery that had been laviſhed on him almoſt overcame his
warineſs. However, to make all ſure, as he had ſome buſineſs at
Warwick,—indeed no other than to con his leſſon as to his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1185300302:71"/> againſt Swaſh—he took that opportunity of
carrying home the coat himſelf.</p>
               <p>Being arrived at Mr. Figgins's, he was very kindly welcomed,
detained all night, paid his bill, and informed that more clothes would be
ſent for, to be got ready againſt the aſſize ball; to which our hero
added, 
<q rend="inline">'I wiſh we could prevail on you, ſir, to
ſettle here, for there is not one of your profeſſion within twenty miles
who knows even how to ſet on a button with taſte.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The taylor acceeded to the fact, took a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion of
merit to himſelf, and went home in high ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Swaſh was to be tried on the laſt day of the aſſizes, on
the motion of the counſel, and three days previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the trial an order was
ſent to the taylor from our hero for ſome clothes for the aſſize ball.
The taylor could not refuſe to execute the order, but, nevertheleſs, very
anxious to be in time for the trial, was determined he would be at Warwick the
night before.</p>
               <p>A ſervant being diſpatched to ſuggeſt alterations and
delays, till he ſhould be detained very late that evening, he at length
arrived, clothes and all, at <pb n="70" facs="tcp:1185300302:72"/> Mr. Figgins's, about half an
hour paſt eleven o'clock, moſt exceedingly fatigued.</p>
               <p>Figgins took him very cordially by the hand, and led him into a
parlour, where, at near one—the clocks being put back almoſt an
hour—ſupper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. The taylor proteſting he never was ſo
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to make a good meal in his life, fell to very heartily. Thus the
time paſſed on till within a quarter of an hour of day light, though by the
clocks—being once more put back—the taylor did not believe it ſo
late by two hours. At length he was led to bed completely drunk. Having ſlept
till two o'clock in the afternoon—which will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear extraordinary if
we conſider his drunkenneſs and fatigue—he awoke, without
recollecting for ſome moments where he was. When he felt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a fine,
ſoft, ſtately bed, he began to have ſome faint idea how he came there;
but, as every thing appeared as dark as pitch, he concluded it was in the
middle of the night, and turned to go to ſleep again; this, after tumbling
and toſſing for half an hour, he effected, and taking another pretty good
nap, waked about half an hour paſt ſix.</p>
               <p>Feeling a violent head-ach, and finding himſelf intolerably
hungry, he could not help thinking the night remarkably long. He got out of the
bed, and <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1185300302:73"/> groped about for the windows, and having drawn
one of the curtains, opened the ſhutters, but it was all the ſame. He could
not throw up the ſaſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, owing, as he ſuppoſed, to a mode of
faſtening it, which he did not underſtand. He was yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, however,
that it was not near day light, and therefore determined to go to bed
again.</p>
               <p>In groping out his way, he caught hold of the toſſel of a
bell, whieh immediately tingled very forcibly. This frightened him out of his
wits.—How could he apologize in a gentleman's houſe for making ſuch a
diſturbance? After he had been in bed about a quarter of an hour, in anxious
hope that nobody had heard the bell, a ſervant came into his room, with a
candle, yawning, ſtretching, and rubbing his eyes, who aſked him what he
would be pleaſed to have.</p>
               <p>The taylor begged his pardon a hundred times, for diſturbing
him, though it was nearly ſeven in the evening, and aſked what o'clock it
was, and how long it would be till day light?</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'O'clock, ſir!' ſaid the ſervant, why we
han't a been in bed above a quarter of an hour; I believe there will be a good
three hours yet before the cock crows.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:1185300302:74"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Three hours!' cried the taylor, 'why I never
paſſed ſuch a night in my life! Three hours!—why I ſeem as if I
had lain twenty; and then I am ſo curſed hungry.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Ay, that is your long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſir,' ſaid
John.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I don't know what the devil it is,' ſaid the
taylor, 'but could not you, my dear Mr. John, get me a bit of ſomething for
the tooth?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Lord love you, no ſuch thing,' ſaid John;
'you muſt e'en ſtay till morning.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!' cried the taylor, 'why I ſhall be
famiſhed in three hours; I never had ſuch a craving in my life.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well, well,' ſaid John, 'then I will ſee
what I can do; but I muſt get the keys of old Mother Search, the
houſe-keeper, and ſhe is a devil of a cruſty toad, I can tell
you.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The taylor implored him to ſee what he could do, and John
ſaid he would return directly. He did not, however, make his appearance for
another half hour, when he brought word that there was nothing to be had.</p>
               <p>This news the taylor was obliged to ſwallow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the
repaſt he had expected, and wiſhing John a good night, endeavoured once
more to get to ſleep. This however was impoſſible; he kicked about,
turned, twiſted, got up, lay down, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whiles, fell into a kind of
doſe, till night <pb n="73" facs="tcp:1185300302:75"/> actually came. His patience was now
entirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and, for the firſt time, he ſuſpected that ſome
trick had been played him. The whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this family had been ſo
extraordinary, that he began now to reflect on his neighbours' ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions;
but then, how could that apply to him?—he had nothing to be robbed of.
They might mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, however, but what harm had he done to any body? Perhaps
it was all a drunken frolic:—perhaps it was day-light all this time.
Whatever it was, he might be ſure no ſervant would ſet him right; he was
therefore determined to ſally forth, and know the truth of every thing.</p>
               <p>So reſolved, he immediately put on his clothes, and groping
out the door, met with no impediment all the way to the garden, where, by
feeling about, he ſoon found himſelf. Here he gave that credit to the
ſtars which he denied to John, and being now convinced his brain was
affected, he thought he could not do better than return, without giving any
further diſturbance to the family. This, however, was not ſo eaſily
practicable as he imagined. The door had ſhut after him in ſuch a manner,
that he found it out of his power to open it.</p>
               <p>His ſituation was now truly deplorable. He durſt not knock,
for fear of making more diſturbance in <pb n="74" facs="tcp:1185300302:76"/> the houſe. In
the mean time he was devoured with hunger, and being in a ſtrange place, in
the night, his fancy transformed every buſh, not into an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, but a
ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe apprehenſions were not a little heightened by a
variety of noiſes, which now aſſailed his ears. Clanking of chains,
groans, and howls fixed him petrified to the ſpot, while ſtrange lights,
which came and diſappeared, added not a little to the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid workings of his
teeming fancy. At length ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tapped him upon the ſhoulder, when
turning round in an agony of fear, he ſaw, as plain as ever he did any thing
in his life, John Swaſh ſtaring him in the face. What at this moment were
the poor taylor's ſenſations! He ſqueaked, kicked, plunged, without being
able to take his eyes from this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful object, till preſently his ſight
failed him, his muſcles were all relaxed, and he meaſured his length on the
ground.</p>
               <p>A few tweaks by the noſe and ſome cold water brought him a
little to himſelf, when he found John and another ſervant lifting him up.
This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance did not a little facilitate his recovery. The moment he
got the uſe of his ſpeech, he cried out, 
<q rend="inline">'For the love of God, dear chriſtian
gentlemen, ſpeak to me! Oh Lord, is he gone? Did you <pb n="75" facs="tcp:1185300302:77"/>
ſee him? Oh dear, dear, dear, dear—there he comes again! Hold me
faſt!—don't let him fly away with me!'</q>
               </p>
               <p>John and his fellow ſervant had ſome difficulty to comply
with his requeſt, he ſtruggled ſo hard, for fear gave him the ſtrength
of a giant.</p>
               <p>The ſpectre approaching, the taylor's fear, or rather horror,
was beyond deſcription 
<q rend="inline">'There,' cried he, 'Don't you ſee it?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'See what?' ſaid John, 'I ſee nothing but
the trees and the ſtars, do you Thomas?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Not I,' ſaid Thomas.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Come come, ſir, doo ey goo to bed—yow
han not a ſlept to night. When the woine a be got out of your head, yowl be
in your right wits, like a ſober parſon.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ghoſt now began to ſpeak. 
<q rend="inline">'Huſh, huſh,' cried the taylor.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh Lord have mercy upon me, ſave and deliver
me. It ſpeaks! Oh John Swaſh, John Swaſh, how have I offended
thee?'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh miſerable taylor, liſten to me,' ſaid
the ghoſt.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I will John indeed,' ſaid the poor
terror-ſtruck wretch,</q> and now the ghoſt went on.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'For the lucre of gain thou didſt try to hang
me. <pb n="76" facs="tcp:1185300302:78"/> though well thou knoweſt I never did thee harm; but
I have eſcaped thy malice, for rather than bring diſgrace upon my poor wife
and family, I made away with myſelf. Now if thou wiſheſt to ſleep
peaceably in thy bed, make a full confeſſion of thy wickedneſs to Sir
Sidney Roebuck, and through him reſtore to my unhappy family that money which
thou haſt at different times frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened me out of. Remember, and let not my
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſpirit viſit thee a ſecond time.'</q> So ſaying, the ghoſt
diſappeared.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Lord have mercy, ſave, deliver, and forgive
my ſins,' ſaid the taylor.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'What d'ye toak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout?' ſaid Thomas.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Pardon a poor, wretched, miſerable ſinner,'
exclaimed the taylor.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Come come,' ſaid John, 'it will be time
enough to ſay your prayers when you are up in your room.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'How can you be ſo blaſphemous?' ſaid the
taylor, 'did not you hear what he ſaid?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Who? Who?' cried John.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why the man's out of his wits.'—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Who!' exclaimed Snip, 'why poor John Swaſh; I
have killed, I have murdered him, and his blood will be on my hands.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Odds wounds,' cried Thomas, 'theſe be odd
ſort of ſpeeches; I do not wonder yow be troubled in mind, if yow a done
ſuch wicked things as theſe:—but coom, yow be only a ſleep, and a
dreaming.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:1185300302:79"/> In ſhort, the trembling taylor was at
laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to his room, where he lay ſweating and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and
almoſt ſuffocated under the clothes, till day-light.</p>
               <p>He now got up, and ſaying his prayers longer and louder than
ever he had done in his life, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, though ſtill in bodily fear, to
conſider how he ſhould prevent a ſecond viſit from the ghoſt. As
however the family was not yet ſtirring, and he thought he had made pretty
ſufficient diſturbance in it already, he returned once more to bed, where,
having undergone ſo much mental and corporeal fatigue, he fell into a ſound
ſleep, which probably ſaved him from a ſevere fit of ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>The reader has ſeen that the windows had been purpoſely
blocked up, on the firſt night, on the out ſide, to cheat the taylor,
through the whole of that day, into a belief that it was not yet light; by
which means the trial of Swaſh came on, and he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted for want of
evidence; for as to the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, Figgins had ſeen, and ſo completely
intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated him, with threatening to lay a detainer againſt him on another
ſcore, that he purpoſely prevaricated on the trial, and the whole
buſineſs was diſmiſſed as frivolous and vexatious. The noiſe which
the taylor heard when he was in the garden, and which <pb n="78" facs="tcp:1185300302:80"/> his
fears had ſo greatly magnified, was nothing more than the taking down the
blinds, which, as I have ſaid, on the outſide were affixed to the
windows.—But the ghoſt was no other than the individual John Swaſh,
who had been releaſed in the afternoon, and properly tutored for the
purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The taylor, at the proper time, was ſummoned to breakfaſt in
the parlour, where he was kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Mr. Figgins and Charles, as well
as the poet and the muſician:—the painter being gone to take a walk.
They informed him they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſorry to hear he had been ſo ill in
the night, and the poet, pretending to know ſomething of phyſic, felt his
pulſe, which having done very grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he declared that the gentleman was
not ſo ill in body as that he was troubled with thick-coming fancies that
diſturbed his reſt.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'That's very true, ſir,' ſaid the taylor,
'you have found out my diſorder at once.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well but can't you cure him of that?' ſaid
Figgins.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'No,' anſwered the poet gravely, 'in that
caſe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt adminiſter unto himſelf.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Thank you ſir,' ſaid the taylor; 'it is
very true—he muſt indeed—and ſo I will, if it ſhall pleaſe
God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am many hours older.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:1185300302:81"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You ſee, you ſee,' ſaid the poet, 'I know
all the ſymptoms of this diſorder. You are very hungry ſir, are you
not?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes ſir,' ſaid the taylor, 'I dare ſay I
could eat a ſhoulder of mutton, and look round me.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'A bad ſymptom, ſir,' ſaid the poet.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Pooh, pooh,' cried Charles, 'I will never
believe that a hungry ſick man is in much danger. Come John, let us have the
breakfaſt, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will be too late for the trial.'</q> Then
addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to the taylor: 
<q rend="inline">'When do you expect it to come on ſir? I hope
you will convict the raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; for really times are come to ſuch a paſs
that an honeſt man cannot keep his property in ſafety.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> The taylor's countenance underwent ſeveral alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and
he faultered out, 
<q rend="inline">'why ſir I don't think it will come on at
all.'</q> Here John came in with a ſmoaking plate of toaſt. 
<q rend="inline">'Zounds, let us fall to,'</q> ſaid Charles. 
<q rend="inline">'Come ſir, help your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The taylor began to put a piece to his mouth, when in came the
painter. 
<q rend="inline">'Your ſervant,' ſaid Figgins, 'where have
you been this morning?'—</q>
                  <q rend="inline">'Faith,' ſaid Muſquito, 'I have been to
ſee a very unpleaſant ſpectacle, I aſſure you. A poor fellow, one
Swaſh, who was to have been tried this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="80" facs="tcp:1185300302:82"/> for
ſheep-ſtealing, poiſoned himſelf laſt night in his cell, and, through
the intereſt of Sir Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Roebuck, the coroner's verdict was returned
lunacy, and they are now carrying the body to his wife and children.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the tea and toaſt dropt out of the taylor's hand, and he
entreated, for the love of God, that he might be conducted to that very Sir
Sidney Roebuck, for he could not eat nor ſleep before he diſburthened his
conſcience of ſomething that lay very heavy on it.</p>
               <p>Every one affected extraordinary ſurpriſe at this
declaration; after which, Mr. Figgins ſaid 
<q rend="inline">'Sir, I am a clergyman, and if I can do you any
ſervice by hearing your confeſſion, and giving you ſalutary advice, I
will do it with pleaſure.'</q> To which the terrified taylor—looking
about him—ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'No ſir, that won't do; I am afraid he will
appear again if I tell it to any body but Sir Sidney.'—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Appear!' ſaid Charles, 'Who? Who will
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'The ghoſt ſir, the ghoſt!' ſaid the
tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; 'John Swaſh's ghoſt!'</q>
               </p>
               <p>A gentleman now deſired to ſpeak with Mr. Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, who
being uſhered in, proved to be Sir Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:1185300302:83"/> The moment the taylor ſaw him, he fell
upon his knees, and cried out 
<q rend="inline">'Oh dear ſir forgive me.'—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Forgive you!' ſaid Sir Sidney, 'why who are
you?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Sir,' ſaid he, 'I am the taylor, the wicked
taylor that tried to hang John Swaſh.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The baronet was then informed of all the ghoſt enjoined Snip,
and at length, on his earneſt entreaty, went apart with him to make an ample
confeſſion. This indeed amounted to nothing criminal in the taylor, except
the extortion of the money; but it laid up ſuch a body of evidence againſt
the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants from Little Hockley, as the baronet had no doubt would put a
ſtop to their nefarious attempts for the future.</p>
               <p>The taylor's confeſſion being ſigned and ſworn to, he
was permitted to eat a voracious breakfaſt with John, for nothing after this
could prevail on him to come into the parlour.</p>
               <p>A large cavalcade now appeared in the road, which poor Snip, as
well as every body elſe, knew to be the judges, who were leaving Warwick to
open the aſſizes at Worceſter.</p>
               <p>The taylor, though no great conjuror, ſaw plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had been
tricked. He now neither wondered <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1185300302:84"/> at his
reſtleſſneſs nor his hunger, and leſt he ſhould any longer remain
in doubt, John Swaſh himſelf—who ſoftly entered the
kitchen—tapped him upon the ſhoulder once more, ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">'Maſter Cabbage, you have twice taken me for a
ghoſt, beware of the third time.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The taylor received a very wholeſome admonition from Sir
Sidney, who explained to him in very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic terms, the cruelty and wanton
maliciouſneſs of diſturbing the quiet of a man and his family, who, he
ſaid, were objects of great compaſſion, as well as praiſe; for there
were very few inſtances of thoſe who had ſo given themſelves up to bad
exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as to have been guilty of every wickedneſs and depravity, and
afterwards deſirous of returning from their vicious courſes. He ſaid
there was no encouragement to which ſuch objects were not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled. How
reprehenſible then was it in thoſe who waited for the moment when ſuch
ſhould return to virtue, and, in conſequence of their honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
become in tolerable circumſtances, to ſeek for opportunities to
diſtreſs and harraſs them, and ſo prevent the happy effects of their
laudable and honeſt endeavours.</p>
               <p>As for the taylor, he told him he was well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced he had
been ſet on by others, and as he had <pb n="83" facs="tcp:1185300302:85"/> now made a candid
and fair confeſſion relative to all thoſe dark conſpiracies which he
plainly ſaw were levelled againſt theſe poor repentant ſinners, if he
would go on a little further, and join with him in detecting this knot of
villains, he might rely upon his favour; and he would enjoy a much higher
ſatisfaction—that of diſcharging his duty as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man.</p>
               <p>The taylor was ſuffered to depart, after faithfully

               <argument>
                  <p>A NEW CURE FOR AN AMOROUS FEVER.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE houſekeeping of Mr. Figgins, near War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, being now
broken up, Charles and his friend returned to Hazard houſe, and Muſquito,
Ego, and Toogood to Roebuck hall.</p>
               <p>Charles had noticed that Muſquito, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his
ſatiric vein, had conceived himſelf a kind of ſuperior to his two
companions; for when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it came up in converſation that they had been
ridiculed in the buſineſs of the ghoſt, he took care ſagaciouſly to
hint that no one dared play him ſuch a trick.</p>
               <p>Our hero was therefore determined to leave him no room for
exultation, eſpecially as by the mode through which he intended to ſhew him
off, as well as the reſt, he ſhould do even a more meritorious act than he
had done in ſaving Emma from the perſecutions of the poet and the
muſician. This method of ſtudying miſchief, only by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting 
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1185300302:87"/> merited puniſhment, was a ſpecies of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in
which it has been ſeen our hero delighted. It certainly was highly
praiſeworthy in one ſenſe, for it turned every thing off with a laugh
only againſt the offender, whereas, had it been ſhaped into a complaint,
and preferred againſt him to Sir Sidney, it might have endangered the hopes
which he built on his patronage.</p>
               <p>John Swaſh had a daughter, who muſt have had an uncommon
mind for her ſituation in life; for, from her earlieſt infancy, ſhe was
remarked to have had a deteſtation to that vice which ſurrounded her. She
profitted by avoiding bad examples as much as others by imitating good ones. In
ſhort—which is the ſtrongeſt proof that can be given of the
excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of her heart, and the incorruptibility of her honour, ſhe, at
eighteen, was as ſpotleſs a character at Little Hockley, as the moſt
innocent inhabitant of her age and ſex could be at Caſtlewick.</p>
               <p>The painter had long laid ſiege to this young creature, who
had all that beauty which regular features, roſy health, and a perfect
ſymmetry of form can give. He drew her likeneſs, and took care it ſhould
be a flattering one. He took a ſketch of the mill, and made it a preſent to
Swaſh, whoſe profeſſional pride was thus tickled. He painted a 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1185300302:88"/> favourite tortoiſeſhell cat for the mother, and, in a
variety of other inſtances, made his talents ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to his
wiſhes; but, in particular, he vaunted that he had been the principal
inſtrument in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the taylor from appearing at the trial.</p>
               <p>I know not if the girl's gratitude on the ſide of her duty
pleaded in his favour, or whether nature began to whiſper to her that, good
as ſhe was, love—as ſomebody has expreſſed it—is the
ſovereign end of our being; but certainly ſhe began to liſten to the
painter's converſation with pleaſure, and as ſhe had never in her life
been controlled, ſcrupled not to walk with him in an evening. She ſoon,
however, repented of her complaiſance, and was almoſt fatally convinced on
what terms theſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities were requeſted. She reſented his
inſolence, which was manuel as well as verbal, and without ceremony informed
her mother of all that had paſſed, who, good woman, I am ſorry to ſay
it, did not make ſuch forcible objections to it as the daughter did. To ſay
the truth, ſhe had a large fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and looked upon her daughters as much in
the light of traffic, as her barley meal. In ſhort, won by a handſome
ſum, a promiſe of painting her picture in the attitude of milking a
favourite cow, and a half anker of genuine nantz—with ſhame I write
it—after but little heſitation, ſhe agreed to <pb n="87" facs="tcp:1185300302:89"/>
this method of providing for her girl as ſhe called it.</p>
               <p>This good woman, in her youth, had been toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably handſome
herſelf. Maſter Fluſh had been heard to intimate that he fancied the
governor—meaning Standfaſt—had taken care to provide a birth in
heaven for Maſter Swaſh, in the month of April; but I am afraid nobody had
ſo ſtrong a claim to that favour as Lord Hazard.</p>
               <p>Charles had eyed this girl with pleaſure, but would not for
the univerſe have given way to the ſhadow of an impulſe to her
diſhonour. And here it may not be amiſs to beg the reader will ſtop with
me, and admire how greatly to our own advantage we take reſolutions which are
in favour of virtue; for it is within poſſibility that, had our hero given
way to an inclination natural enough for a youth of warm blood to entertain,
and I hope full as natural if there were any thing like honour in his
diſpoſition, to conquer—hear it ye ſeducers of virtue! Ye
mercileſs triumphant deſpoilers of innocence! who are cruel becauſe you
have power!—inſolent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe victorious!—hear it, and reflect
with horror on the miſeries that to often reſult from your vices,—he
might have contaminated a ſiſter!!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:1185300302:90"/> From ſo deplorable a crime, however
uninten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, did Charles, by his perſeverance in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
reſolutions, very probably eſcape; for he, by his frequent chat with this
girl, had taught her boſom to glow with tenderneſs, but having put the
curb, as we have ſeen, upon his wiſhes, and ceaſed to be particular from
the moment he was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of danger—during which interval the
painter ſtept in—ſhe found ſome pleaſure, which the reader may be
aſſured is not unnatural, in liſtening to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the ſame kind
from another, even though it was not ſo eloquently worded, or ſo gracefully
delivered.</p>
               <p>As Charles withdrew his attention from this girl upon a ground
for which ſhe loved him ſtill more—for he made no ſcruple of
confeſſing the truth—the poor girl having been repulſed by her
mother, as we have ſeen, or rather encouraged to make her fortune, according
to the old gentlewoman, by that which, according to any body elſe, would have
been her ruin, was walking ſolitary and unhappy by the ſide of her father's
mill-ſtream, when Figgins and our hero paſſed by. Charles ſaw the
pearly tear ſtanding on her cheek, and very good naturedly enquired the
cauſe. After a little reluctance ſhe informed him, and concluded her
artleſsly pathetic <pb n="89" facs="tcp:1185300302:91"/> ſtory with ſaying 
<q rend="inline">'Indeed it is a ſad thing when a poor girl's
mother bids her to be wicked; but I won't be wicked, if I am ever ſo
undutiful I won't.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Both Charles and Figgins commended her laudable reſolution,
and now occurred an admirable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of puniſhing the painter in his
own way. He immediately told the girl of his intention; to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which,
ſhe was deſired to acquaint her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſhe would be a good girl,
and behave civil to the gentleman, and, when he came, ſhe ſhould make him
an appointment in the duſk of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the bed chamber; that he would
let her father privately into the ſecret, who ſhould, in concert with them,
ſo revenge himſelf upon her audacious lover, as to leave him very little
reliſh for ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement in future.</p>
               <p>The girl was charmed to find her cauſe taken up ſo warmly by
our hero, for ſhe knew, let what would happen, the painter muſt not dare to
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
               <p>The aſſignation was made, and Swaſh apprized of the whole
buſineſs. The painter, as may naturally be ſuppoſed, attended
punctually, and the huſband being, as it was imagined, ſafe at the ale
houſe, the <pb n="90" facs="tcp:1185300302:92"/> amorous Appelles was conducted to the young
lady's bed chamber, by her accommodating mamma, and deſired to go to bed,
where he ſhould be made as happy as he could wiſh.</p>
               <p>He had not lain long in this ſituation, before he heard a foot
upon the ſtairs, when immediately his heart beat high, his fancy anticipated
the expected pleaſure, and all his ſenſes were in an alarm; but, however,
all theſe were nothing to the alarm that preſently followed. In
ruſhed—at leaſt his fears made him believe ſo—half a dozen
myrmidons; pop half a dozen times went half a dozen piſtols; the firſt of
which was a ſufficient intimation that the ſalute had very little of love
in it. Indeed he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered how it came that he was not a dead man, for his
fears had wounded him in twenty places.</p>
               <p>The very firſt of theſe hints he took, and darting out of
the foot of the bed, he preſently cleared the landing place, and gained the
bottom of the ſtairs; by which time he received a few more compliments of the
ſame kind. Theſe, however, though they were unneceſſary to refreſh
his memory, haſtened his departure, which he took without paying the
ſmalleſt compliment to any of the family, but ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at the
ſtreet door, made his way acroſs a paddock, which led to the road; his
purſuers ſtill <pb n="91" facs="tcp:1185300302:93"/> popping at ſuch a rate, that he
verily believed he was flying from a whole platoon.</p>
               <p>Being come to a bank, he collected his whole might to jump over
the hedge, into the road, but the diſtance being greater than he imagined, he
plunged, with all his force, naked as he was, into a bramble buſh, which
clinging in a hundred places to his ſhirt, and in as many to his fleſh,
pinned him down ſo firmly, that he was obliged to make ſeveral excruciating
efforts to free himſelf. He did ſo how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever at laſt, but finding
himſelf ſurrounded with enemies, who were ſtill popping at him, he
doubled as artfully as any Jack hare, and was followed as cloſely, with this
difference, that the game opened inſtead of the pack; for he yelped, howled,
ſwore, ejaculated, curſed, and prayed, in ſuch a ſtrange collection of
hyſterical tones, that the muſician, who was then preſent, had as much
reaſon to be enraged as Hogarth's, for all the complicated din there
deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, ſeemed to be centured in one perſon.</p>
               <p>This diſcordance however did not laſt long, for trying to
croſs the mill ſtream by a bridge, which to be ſure had been laid down an
hour before, but was now drawn up, poor Muſquito came ſouſe over head and
ears into the water, which being in that part pretty deep, would have cooled
him for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing, <pb n="92" facs="tcp:1185300302:94"/> and every thing elſe in this world,
had not a large fiſhing net been previouſly placed to receive him.</p>
               <p>The net was immediately drawn up, which, with all the haſte
they could make however, was not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected before the poor painter had totally
loſt his ſenſes.</p>
               <p>He was now put into a ſhell, and the church being near,
carried to the bone houſe, where being held up by the heels, a quantity of
water ran out of his mouth, and he preſently exhibited ſigns of life. The
moment this event took place, they hurried off with the lanthorn—the only
light they had—and the ſexton, who, being a friend to the miller,
connived at the trick, immediately returned with his mattock and ſhovel on
his ſhoulder.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'There,' ſaid he, as if to himſelf, 'that
job's done.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh d d d d dear,' cried the painter,</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'It is odd there ſhould be nobody to own the
man,' cried the ſexton, putting down his things.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'B b b oh—ah—oh—' cried the
painter.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I have made him a good grave, however,' cried
the ſexton, 'and as ſoon as the coroner's queſt has ſat upon
him—'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:1185300302:95"/> The painter now muſtered ſtrength
enough to ſit up, and cried, 
<q rend="inline">'Oh d d d d dear—f f f f
friend.'—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Lord, what's that!' ſaid the ſexton.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh f f f f for the love of God help me,' cried
Muſquito.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why lookee now,' ſaid the ſexton, 'here's
my man come to life. Lie down now doey; lie down, I ha been juſt making your
grave.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh Lord,' exclaimed the painter, 'my g g g g
grave!'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Ay ay, nobody will own you, you ſee, and ſo
we ſhall bury you to-morrow morning.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Bury me!' cried the painter, who had by this
time got out of the ſhell. 'Oh Chriſt, where am I brought to?'—then
looking round him—'Oh, dear friend have pity upon me.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Odds wounds,' cried the ſexton, 'don't come
nigh me; I never could abide a dead body in my life, unleſs in the way of
buſineſs, and when it was ſcrewed up, as a body may ſay: ſo don't
come nigh me.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The painter told him he was alive, the ſexton ſaid he was a
damned liar, and took up the lanthorn to be gone: the painter followed: the
ſexton hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howing out 
<q rend="inline">'the devil take the hindmoſt.'</q> At length,
turning round a corner of the church, he blew out the candle, ſlipt away, and
the painter found himſelf alone, ſore from head to foot, wet and naked, in
the middle of a church yard, above <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1185300302:96"/> two miles from Sir
Sidney's, at half an hour paſt ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>In this condition he poſted to the alehouſe, where he
intended to have trumped up a ſtory of his being robbed, but his old friend
the ſexton being the firſt man he ſaw in the room, he only deſired the
uſe of ſome clothes, for which he ſaid he would ſatisfy them
handſomely.</p>
               <p>The man of the houſe agreed to accommodate him, and fetched
ſome things for that purpoſe, which Muſquito put on before the fire; for
the landlady was gone to bed. In the mean time the gueſts were not ſparing
of their jokes. 
<q rend="inline">'Bleſs me,' ſaid one, 'the gentleman has
been ſadly mauled with zummet! He looks as if he had tumbled into a hornet's
neſt.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Icod,' ſaid another, 'I think its more like
being ſcratched with cats.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Very loikely,' ſaid another, 'two legged cats
may hap.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Lord love you,' cried the ſexton, 'you noas
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about it. The gentleman was tooked up in the mill-dam. They
miſtooken for a viſh.—Dam maw, I thoughten the biggeſt Jack I ever
ſawed. And ſo as I was a telling you, when the gentleman coomed in, we took
un to the boane-houſe. Adds waunds meaſter, you do ought to 
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1185300302:97"/> give maw zummet to drink your health, after making your
grave.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The painter did not reply a ſingle word to all this wit; but,
having hurried on the landlord's clothes, and ſaid he would return them in
the morning, and ſatisfy him for his trouble, he ſneaked to Sir Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's,
and ſkulked up ſtairs to bed.</p>
               <p>Charles and Figgins came in the morning to breakfaſt. Every
body was very inquiſitive to know how it happened that the painter had not
ſupped at home. One ſaid ſignificantly he was perhaps better engaged;
another, that whatever his amuſement was, he hoped it was to his liking. In
ſhort, the poor painter was handſomely played off. At laſt it came to Sir
Sidney's turn, who ſaid honeſt Swaſh had been with him that morning about
an affair ſomething in the ſtyle of the ſoldier and the king of
France:—the ſoldier craved pardon for having thrown a man's hat out of
window, and, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, ſaid he had thrown his head out too.</p>
               <p>Here Sir Sidney related the whole buſineſs of the preceding
evening, as indeed he had heard it from Charles, not from Swaſh. He concealed
his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the gallant, who, he ſaid, was rightly ſerved, and he
only wiſhed the next time the gentleman, <pb n="96" facs="tcp:1185300302:98"/> whoever he was,
took it into his head to corrupt innocence and deſtroy domeſtic peace, he
would never after having done ſo preſume to come into his preſence. He
concluded with reprobating the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the mother, and heartily
recommending the girl to Lady Roebuck's notice, who declared, as Emma was in
want of an aſſiſtant, ſhe ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately placed about the
perſon of Annette.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>IN WHICH THE READER IS ATTACKED ON THE SIDE OF HIS
SENSIBILITY.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT never, for a ſingle moment, occurred to Charles that he had
wrought an event moſt wonderfully in his own favour by thus puniſhing the
painter; for Jude—ſo was the miller's daughter called—rang the
changes in his praiſe ſo continually, that, as her voice was the voice of
nature, and her ſentiments ſtrong genuine gratitude, his cauſe could not
even in Emma have had half ſo powerful an advocate: nay with Emma
herſelf:—for though ſhe was well enough pleaſed that the youth had
conceived favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoughts of her, though ſhe admired the ready
willingneſs with which he had corrected his error, yet there was, with her, a
diſtinct difference in the two caſes. As to herſelf, ſhe was a hoſt
alone; ſhe defied temptation; and, to ſuch a youth as Charles, ſhe was
rather pleaſed than concerned that ſhe had had an opportunity of ſhewing
upon what erroneous ground he began his career, and what certain mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
would be the conſequence of his perſuting in <pb n="98" facs="tcp:1185300302:100"/>
indiſcriminate purſuits, in which he might be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, though he would
often dupe others, he would oftener be duped himſelf.</p>
               <p>Emma repreſented to him that the ſenſations of a tender
and ſuſceptible heart, which had given a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle pang to ſuffering
virtue, muſt be intolerable; and therefore conjured him to ceaſe from a
conduct which was fooliſh as well as wicked, impolitic as well as unworthy;
for it was a barter of virtue for infamy, tranſient pleaſure for laſting
pain: and however conſonant to the boiſterous and turbulent paſſions of
youth, would, throughout his life, be overſhadowed by a cloud of
wretchedneſs, which the ſplendour of rank and diſtinction would vainly
ſtruggle to diſſipate.</p>
               <p>To ſay the truth, this incident had touched Emma in the right
key; for if ſhe gave Charles credit for his delicate and honourable treatment
of Jude, how much then was due to her admonitions which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it?</p>
               <p>If Emma had a weak ſide, certainly this was it. She was
perfectly a ſchemer on the ſide of virtue, and thought the paſſions
might be bottled up, like the winds of Aeolus; forgetting that there never
wants curious and turbulent ſpirits to let them out, <pb n="99" facs="tcp:1185300302:101"/>
not only to excite freſh dangers, but make the caſe worſe, by leaving no
remedy.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, nothing could be purer than poor Emma's
intentions, which, though they were not always infallible, hit nine times out
of ten as ſhe wiſhed they ſhould. Here it was impoſſible they
ſhould miſs. Standfaſt indeed, had he ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended, would
have at pleaſure changed the form of every one of them; and, ſpight of
Emma's pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, have ſhewn them, even to her, ſo deformed that ſhe
ſhould ſcarcely have known them for her own.</p>
               <p>This gentleman, however, ſeems to be meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a
diſtance; and, as the courſe is left free for youth, ſweetneſs, good
nature, and ingenuity to pay their open court to beauty, modeſty, and
delicate ſenſibility, no wonder if, ſanctioned by parents, ſtrongly
ſupported by irreſiſtible advocates, and their mutual wiſhes being in
their eſſence eminently congenial, a ſtrong, and, one would think,
indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble compact muſt naturally be formed between Charles and
Annette.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak plain, which I, as well as Emma, think the beſt
way, ſo many were the deſirable ends an union between this amiable couple
promiſed to ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, <pb n="100" facs="tcp:1185300302:102"/> that, had it not been for
their youth—though probably they would not have found that an
objection—neither themſelves, the fathers and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, connections and
dependants, the two villages of Caſtlewick and Little Hockley—for
Little Hock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was really now riſing into ſame, in ſpight of Mrs.
Swaſh and her unworthy propenſities, for which, between the reader and I,
ſhe got well thraſhed by her huſband—not one of theſe I ſay but
would have bleſſed the day which united this lovely pair, and, what to
ſome of them would not have been an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome object, have produced an
extraordinary grand feaſt.</p>
               <p>But whether fortune thought with Emma that virtues and
paſſions are given us to be exerciſed and controlled, or whether the
mind, like the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is ſoberer in its age for having been taken
down in its youth, I ſhall not pretend to decide here:—certain it is
that the blind and varying god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs did not altogether take part with the
friends of our hero and heroine; the reaſon why, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how, ſhe
thought proper to diſſent from this otherwiſe unanimous opinion, will
hereafter be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually developed. In the mean time, I am really concerned
that, juſt when we find Charles and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette in the full enjoyment of their
friends' admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that of one another, I ſhould be under the 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1185300302:103"/> unpleaſant neceſſity of throwing as complete a
damp over all their ſpirits—ſuch a ſcene of light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is this life—as I had before preſented to them of joy and
exultation.</p>
               <p>I am ſure the very name of poor Lady Hazard will anticipate
every word of the ſad tale it is my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing duty to relate. This amiable
lady, this lovely, this fatal ſacrifice to complicated villany, whoſe fall
was doomed to tear the heart of him who in early life had departed from the
paths of honour: This charming victim, who it ſhould ſeem by an error of
fate received the blow that was meant for her lord:—But it was no error;
it is blindneſs to ſuppoſe fate can err; he was to live, that in the
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of his original guilt, his pangs might tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture him with accumulated
keenneſs:—</p>
               <p>Sweet Lady Hazard, who had ſeemed to decline with the
ſummer, had been for ſome weeks evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently haſtening to her
diſſolution, when at length the ſolemn ſentence of the phyſicians
precluded all hope. Indeed ſhe felt that a few hours would put a period to
her ſufferings, and deſired, with calm reſignation, that ſhe might, for
the laſt time, ſee her friends about her.</p>
               <p>This affecting requeſt was ſoon complied with, 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1185300302:104"/> for Lady Roebuck had been almoſt continually with her
from the moment ſhe was in actual danger, and though our hero and his
companions had, at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent opportunities, employed their time as we have
ſeen, yet the moſt thoughtleſs of them would at any moment have flown to
have contributed in the ſlighteſt degree to her eaſe or comfort. In fact,
ſhe was gliding out of the world by ſuch imperceptible degrees, that, as
ſhe ſupported her melancholy ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with wonderful fortitude, there
had ever been, till very lately, ſome ſlight hope of her recovery.</p>
               <p>Lord Hazard had ſome time, by her own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deſire,
been left alone with his lady. Before however I relate what paſſed at this
affecting inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, that I may not improperly interrupt the reader's banquet
of grief—which by ſome is thought to be a very delicious luxury—I
ſhall notice, in order, if poſſible, to heighten the lovelineſs of Lady
Hazard, and the wretchedneſs of her Lord, that, owing to ſome
expreſſions which fell from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, during the operation at the
John of Gaunt—which I have deſcribed as particular as was neceſſary
or delicate—ſhe became acquainted with that ſecret which ſeems to
be ſet up as a beacon in this hiſtory to warn the reader that a very
ſmall deviation from prudence may plunge a family into irretrievable
miſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:1185300302:105"/> The interview between Lord and Lady
Hazard was of that affecting kind that at once excites pity and terror. It was
one of thoſe moments when the tongue denies relief to the heart, when nature
would ſink but for the aſſiſtance of madneſs, and when the
preſſure of calamity numbs the keenneſs of its tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Lord Hazard, overwhelmed with the recollection of his
unworthineſs, and loaded with the ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching conſciouſneſs of
his guilt, lay in a torpid ſtupor. His angel wife, though every ſigh
haſtened her departure, pitied his pangs, and ſorrowed for his
ſufferings. He, burning to diſcloſe what ſhame forbid him to utter, and
ſhe dreading a horrid tale ſhe had long and ſilently anticipated!</p>
               <p>In this ſtate—that hand of death extended over her brow
which he would have given the world to have been directed to his—no
merciful tear to relieve his ſwolen heart, he muſt have expired with
exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſenſibility, had not a few inarticulate ſounds,
accompanied by a piteous ſigh, burſt from his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured boſom.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Be calm, my ſweet love,' cried Lady
Hazard:</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Calm!' returned he</q>—her celeſtial
voice penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his torn heart, and the tears guſhing in torrents 
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1185300302:106"/> from his eyes—
<q rend="inline">'Yes, calm as the pitileſs butcher that kills
the innocent lamb! When thy ſpotleſs ſoul ſhall look down with juſt
horror and kind commiſeration on thy polluted huſband, and thy cruel
murderer, then tell me to be calm! Infuſe thy incomparable innocence into my
culpable heart, inſpire me with virtue, and teach me to be happy. See! Oh
heavenly God!—ſhe hears me with ſorrow, but not with
aſtoniſhment! She knew it!—'tis plain ſhe knew it!—and my
foul crimes have, like the influence of a malignant poiſon, ſlowly
conſumed her life! Pity, pardon, immaculate angel!—But my thoughtleſs
frenzy is too much for her tender frame. How are you, my love? She anſwers
wildly!'</q>—And ſo indeed ſhe did. Lord Hazard's violence had thrown
her into a delirium, in which ſhe remained a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and then
expired!</p>
               <p>The incoherent expreſſions ſhe uttered during this
melancholy interval, ſufficiently confimed Lord Hazard that his lady was but
too well acquainted with the fatal ſecret; and, leſt he ſhould not be
wretched enough at her loſs, he had now the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional reflection that his
crime had firſt ſapped the foundation of her peace, and afterwards
gradually deſtroyed her life. Regardleſs however of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, or
its conſequences, he ſummoned every <pb n="105" facs="tcp:1185300302:107"/> poſſible
aſſiſtance to her aid; but no ſyllable that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped Lady Hazard
reached any ear, except that Charles, who firſt entered the room, heard his
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fervently exclaim, which were the laſt words ſhe uttered, 
<q rend="inline">'If any bleſſings were in ſtore for me, of
which I have been untimely deprived, ſhower them, merciful heaven, upon the
head of my dear boy.'</q>

               <argument>
                  <p>NEW MATTER.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>Having ſo completely thrown the two families in the country
into the vapours, as to make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould play any of their
whimſical tricks in our abſence, the reader and I will take a look at Mr.
Standfaſt and his aſſociates; and, as much as any thing, becauſe it is
now high time that we ſhould reſcue that gentleman's fame from ſuch an
opprobrious ſtain as that of having compaſſed the death of Lady Hazard,
and brought about that ſcene of diſtreſs deſcribed in the laſt
chapter, ſolely for the purpoſe of doing miſchief.</p>
               <p>I am ready to grant that no man upon earth had more
ſatisfaction in contemplating the wretchedneſs which was produced by any
one of his contrivances, but then I do inſiſt that it was not ſo much for
the pleaſure of the thing, as the collateral conſideration; and I
ſincerely believe, ill as I think of him, that could he have had the
ſmalleſt chance of doubling his <pb n="107" facs="tcp:1185300302:109"/> advantage, be it in
profit or pleaſure, by ſacrific<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his whole party, he would not have made
a ſingle ſcruple.</p>
               <p>But, to argue this matter fairly. What had Mr. Standfaſt
gained by heaping all this complicated miſchief on the head of his friend and
benefactor, but an addition to the ſalary which he had honeſtly earned by
being tutor to Charles? Why nothing literally, to be ſure, as to himſelf.
As to whom then? This is an article that remains to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for. Again,
if Mr. Standfaſt, on his own account, received no other
ſatisfaction—which ſurely was a ſmall reward for ſuch eminent
villany—what other motive ſtimulated him? Revenge.—Revenge!
Yes:—and now let me get rid of theſe two articles. And firſt, as to
whom he ſeemed to be working for.</p>
               <p>Know then reader that Mr. Standfaſt, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummately
artful Mr. Standfaſt, whoſe ſuperior talents in the craft of inflicting
unmerited calamity none ever attained, whoſe truly diabolical ſpirit never
conceived miſchief complete unleſs the ſhaft with which it wounded
ſtruck at virtue, who could cajole and cozen all the world, and dupe every
one elſe, was himſelf a dupe to—Mrs. O'Shockneſy!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:1185300302:110"/> Here is the collateral conſideration,
but whence the revenge? From the ſame quarter. Mr. Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, who held all
women as his ſlaves, who treated ſerious, reaſonable, honourable love as
a banter; who mocked at the very idea of a ſolemn and ſacred obligation to
a woman; this very Mr. Standfaſt,—pity him, oh pity him, villain as he
is—was a ſlave to Mrs. O'Shockneſy. Hence his revenge. He was her
firſt love; was the friend of him who killed her huſband in a duel; ſhe
had a child by him before ſhe ſaw Lord Hazard, and would have married him,
but that his lordſhip ſtept in and carried her:—nay, let me whiſper
to the reader, that it was not impoſſible but Zekiel was his ſon.</p>
               <p>A number of doubts which the reader had before formed, are now
diſſipated; nor will it be neceſſary to go again over the minutiae of
Mr. Standfaſt's conduct, which was dictated by her, though car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into
effect by him; and, as ſhe dared join oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſible acts to his covert
ones, what wonder if the unſuſpecting virtue of Lord Hazard was
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed.</p>
               <p>Her views and her ambition were obvious.—Lady Hazard was
to be put out of the way by a diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical contrivance, which, had it been
avowed, could have faſtened nothing on its perpetrators. His lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1185300302:111"/> would naturally be inconſolable for her loſs, and
who knew if he would ſurvive it, when he came to conſider that it
originated in his guilt. Should this imaginary bleſſing be realized, her
ſon would come into poſſeſſion of the title and eſtate; if not,
ſhe would at leaſt have the triumphant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation that ſhe had
imbittered his future felicity.</p>
               <p>This conduct was natural and common, infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous as it was. But
how ſhall we account for that of her paramour, who could not, fond ſoul,
reſt in the country abſent from her he loved. Charles, as to Miſs
Figgins, was a ſtoic to him. The lady had promiſed, on the death of Lady
Hazard, to honour him with her hand, and inſtead of going to receive the
laſt benediction of an expiring uncle, his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in town was to keep
from expiring the valuable love of the amiable Mrs. O'Shockneſy.</p>
               <p>Thus, while friendſhip, obligation, and all other ties that
naturally induce gratitude, only ſtimulated Mr. Standfaſt to every
atrocious and raſcally mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that could ſap the foundation, and lay a
train for the deſtruction, of that love and harmony that were exemplary in
the family of his patron and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. The mere whim and caprice of a
wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom he knew to be worthleſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely the reverſe of every
thing for which ſhe could <pb n="110" facs="tcp:1185300302:112"/> expect admiration, made
him—expert as he was at every thing artful, proof as he was againſt
every thing but ſelf—undertake the moſt wicked, as well as the moſt
ſilly, things in nature. Here is a Hercules, not contented with wielding the
club—not quite ſo worthily, by the bye—he buckles to the
diſtaff.</p>
               <p>It will be unneceſſary for me to mention that Figgins was
ſent for and fixed with Charles by Mr. Standfaſt's participation; nor will
it very probably have eſcaped the reader's ſagacity that the whole affair
of Miſs Figgins, who had not been with child, was nothing more than to hold
out a pretended ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret over the head of that young gentleman; for both
Standfaſt and Figgins well knew that there is not a ſtronger hold of a
grateful and generous heart than the knowledge of obligation: and this is the
ſort of credulity I have deſcribed as a part of our hero's compoſition,
which, throughout his life, induced him to be thankful to others for lending
him imaginary benefits, that they might receive from him real ones.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould Charles be devoted to the ſame ruin with
others? He could not poſſibly hinder any one of their ſchemes. He had
nothing that could give them the ſmalleſt uneaſineſs. Was it 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1185300302:113"/> then nothing to be the darling child, the hopeful
cheriſhed favourite, while Mrs. O'Shockneſy and her ſon were turned into
the world, the ſport of malicious tongues, and the veſtiges of fallen
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Charles—though were the records of the human heart
ſearched for every thing good and great that ever made up an amiable
character, the ſame marks of worth would be found in his:—Charles
muſt be traduced, muſt be vilified, it was neceſſary, it was material;
he muſt be ſunk that his elder brother might riſe. Beſides, Mr.
Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt had a huſband in his eye for Annette; a better huſband;
ſince who can deny but a rich, ſenſible, thinking youth, as one will
appear, anſwers that deſcription more perfectly than a poor, vicious,
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated, inconſtant wretch, as will be the character of the
other.</p>
               <p>Reader, it was not Zekiel that our friend Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt had found
out for Annette. I know not if ſuch an attempt would not have been a touch
even above his art; but, however, that young gentleman will probably ſhew, by
and by, that he would chuſe to be conſulted before any material ſtep
ſhould be taken that concerned him.</p>
               <p>Maſter Zekiel had, at the time I am ſpeaking, pretty decided
opinions, and one of them was to <pb n="112" facs="tcp:1185300302:114"/> appear, however he
might really be, ſatisfied with all his mother and Mr. Standfaſt ſhould
determine, unleſs they ſhould aſk him to ſign any paper, which he was
fully reſolved never to do.</p>
               <p>As the reader has not yet heard the upſhot of the buſineſs
relative to thoſe letters wherein an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made for the grant of
the eſtate in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire, I may as well inform him here that Sir
Sidney's application rendered that of Mrs. O'Shock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſy and her ſon
fruitleſs; therefore, through Standfaſt's advice, an addition was made to
the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſtipend of the ſon, who immediately left Eaton, and went to
France, with Snaffle for his companion, and Fluſh for his valet; while
Dogbolt, who had long ago dropt his title, being a handſome fellow,
occaſionally comforted Mrs. O'Shockneſy, when Mr. Standfaſt, who as yet
dared not ſee her, except by ſtealth, was out of the way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kiddy had taken good care to make himſelf particularly
uſeful to Zekiel, who ſwore there was ſo much fun and gig about the rum
dog, that he would rather have him for a companion than all the black-jacket
codgers in England.</p>
               <p>Whether Kiddy had any latent meaning in the ſingular pains he
took to ingratiate himſelf with his <pb n="113" facs="tcp:1185300302:115"/> young maſter, I
will not here enquire; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Standfaſt one day told him to take care
how he came on, to which Kiddy archly replied, 
<q rend="inline">'Oh, as for that, maſter governor, don't you
go for to be uneaſy: honour you know among thieves.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I ſhewn, when all things are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that
Standfaſt was the worſt actor in his own farce. Nay I know not, upon all
great occaſions, whether to the ſubordinate objects the whole praiſe is
not attributable. Trim ſays, while he is muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his tattered troop,
fifty thouſand ſuch ragged raſcals as theſe would make an ALEXANDER,
and who can deny but the taylor and the mantua-maker tell truth when they ſay
that the ſplendour of the birth night is owing to them.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>FOR want of leiſure, or perhaps inclination, or for ſome
other wiſe reaſon, no leſs cogent, I did not mention to the reader that,
at the laſt grand feaſt, a young ſtranger appeared, and indeed attracted
a great deal of notice. He was then juſt arrived from Madeira, and brought
letters to Sir Sidney from a merchant there, with whom the baronet dealt for
wines, and tranſacted other buſineſs. Coming ſo opportunely, he was
invited to the feaſt, and cut, as I have ſaid, no inconſiderable
figure.</p>
               <p>Charles took great pleaſure in accommodating this gentleman,
whoſe name was Gloſs; ſtudying his eaſe and convenience while he
remained in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire. He requeſted the pleaſure of correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding
with him, and begged his intimate friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip when he ſhould return to
England, with a view of ſettling, which he talked of doing after he ſhould
have taken a trip to the Cape of Good Hope, where <pb n="115" facs="tcp:1185300302:117"/> his
father had died immenſely rich, on his return from India.</p>
               <p>The winter had now began ſo to perriwig the trees, as
ſomebody has called it—by the way, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body and nobody are very
uſeful figures in rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric—that the ſemicircle of evergreens before
Sir Sidney's ſaloon, with the cluſters near it, looked like a vegetable
court of judges and counſellors, in powdered ties and full-bottoms.</p>
               <p>This hint, and a call of the houſe of commons—for Sir
Sidney had ſtayed in the country beyond his uſual time, rouſed the
baronet, and made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to think of putting on his boots. Yet not even his
duty, dearly as he loved it, could induce him to ſtir a ſtep without Lord
Hazard, who was become what SHAKESPEARE ſays of life, 
<q rend="inline">'a walking ſhadow.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lord Hazard looked upon himſelf as the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of his
wife, and though his grief was inward, yet it did not eſcape ſuch vigilant
friendſhip as Sir Sidney's. His lordſhip declared he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
himſelf to retirement. His friends, however, at length prevailed; and, to
make the ſatisfaction complete and univerſal, Annette was, for the firſt
time, to ſee London, accompanied by Emma.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1185300302:118"/> It was the continual ſtudy of every one
to make Lord Hazard's time paſs agreeably, in which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable taſk Mr.
Standfaſt now aſſiſted, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence his lordſhip
confeſſed contributed greatly to relieve his care, though heaven knows he
had no ſuch intention; for his viſits were for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than to
warn him of certain ſnares which Mrs. O'Shockneſy was not preparing for
him, in order, if poſſible, to entangle him in others that ſhe was.</p>
               <p>About Chriſtmas arrived Charles's friend Gloſs, from the
Cape of Good Hope, where he had, he ſaid, ſettled his affairs greatly to
his ſatisfaction.—He brought anſwers to ſome letters with which Sir
Sidney entruſted him for Madeira.</p>
               <p>As Mr. Gloſs will hereafter cut no inconſiderable figure in
this hiſtory, it may not be improper to give ſome account of him. He was
the ſon of a clergyman, who, probably, knowing that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement in the
learned profeſſions was a thing that depended leſs upon merit than
intereſt, had bred him up to trade: not ſparing, however, to give him a
complete education, which he very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly thought could do him no harm in any
ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:1185300302:119"/> One thing, however, was very romantic in
this ſcheme. All theſe bricks were to be made without ſtraw; for the old
gentleman either could not, or would not, give his ſon a ſhilling, towards
laying a foundation for that fortune he was nevertheleſs ſure he would one
day or other make. But having added the living languages to the dead ones, and
procured a recommendation for him to a counting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe at Liſbon, they
parted: the father furniſhing him with ſome excellent rules for the
regulation of his future conduct, and forbidding him to draw for any thing but
advice.</p>
               <p>The young gentleman's temper happened luckily to fall in with
his father's. He undertook, if he were eligibly ſet out, to make his fortune.
His maxims were, from early youth, that if a man choſe to fix his eye upon a
ſpot, let it be ever ſo out of his preſent reach, or ſurrounded by ever
ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, through perſeverance it might be come at. In little, he
had proved this doctrine to be founded; for he never in his life
poſſeſſed, in his own right, a ſingle ſixpence, and yet he had cut
a figure with the beſt.</p>
               <p>It is curious to remark, that though no man upon earth knew
better the value of ſubſtance than Mr. Gloſs, yet he ſeem conſtantly
to live upon <pb n="118" facs="tcp:1185300302:120"/> ſhadow. The appearance, and not the thing
itſelf, ſeemed to be what he moſt delighted in. He ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
turned round all his employers in their own buſineſs, that the tide of
their fortune ſoon ran in a larger channel, and they were aſtoniſhed at
the riches which originated from plans of his adviſing. They however little
conſidered what a yoke they were forming for themſelves; for it was not
long before the young gentleman ſtipulated for a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of their
profits, in conſequence of which he took the earlieſt opportunity to
involve the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the partnerſhip, and was the only one able to ſave
any thing from the wreck of a bankruptcy, in which the whole concern was ſoon
involved.</p>
               <p>After this ſtroke he went to Madeira, where he drew a picture
of the folly of his partners, and ſhewed very clearly—for it is
certainly true that people are to be reaſoned into, as well as out of, any
thing—how unwiſely they had acted, and how fooliſhly he had thrown
away his time.</p>
               <p>Being, through a houſe with which he had been connected, very
ſoon taken in an active partner, for a ſlight ſhare of the profits, and
with liberty to trade privately on his own account, he entered into the
ſpirit of the Madeira trade in ſuch a ſtyle as aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every
merchant on the iſland. He had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs <pb n="119" facs="tcp:1185300302:121"/> to tie
the Dunkirk dealers down to give him and his connections a preference in
brandies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they dealt to ſuch an amount; in conſequence of which
he ſoon had it in his power to ſtagnate the Dunkirk trade in Madeira, by
being able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſell the brandy merchants themſelves, who, eager to
catch at the bait he held out for them, had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied him largely, little
ſuſpecting he would hold back what he had bought, with a view of
foreſtalling their next market.</p>
               <p>I give this as one among a variety of inſtances in which he
ſaw further into people's affairs than they did themſelves. By this means
he had reſources for them which they never dreamt of, and of courſe was
able to ſtipulate for better terms for himſelf.</p>
               <p>In the mean time it was, one would think, this man's pride never
to have a ſhilling he could call his own. Nothing was expenſive enough for
him, and when it was his turn to treat at Bachelor's-hall,—a place at
Madeira built by the unmarried men, and remarkable for hoſpitality—it
was in a ſtyle that aſtoniſhed every body: for his taſte was equal to
his ingenuity.</p>
               <p>At length Madeira became too barren a ſpot for the fecundity
of his genius. He left it after giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="120" facs="tcp:1185300302:122"/> it many real
advantages, and was univerſally regretted, as a man wonderfully calculated
for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and yet a moſt agreeable companion.</p>
               <p>He got a conſiderable ſum for his concern in the houſe he
left, which he took care, in a few months, to get rid of in England.</p>
               <p>The reader remembers that this gentleman brought letters from
his connections in Madeira to Sir Sidney. Theſe were of courſe greatly in
his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Indeed the baronet was very well diſpoſed to ſhew him any
kindneſs; but it was among the maxims of Mr. Gloſs never to make uſe of a
friend except to carry a material point, and a man muſt be very ſhallow
indeed if he could not pretty well gueſs beforehand whether that point could
be carried.</p>
               <p>The plan upon which this young gentleman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded was very
ſimple, but it required conſummate talents. It was nothing more than to
adminiſter to every man's foibles, and reprobate his vices. It is
imppoſſible to deſcribe how a man is infallibly taken hold of by a
conduct of this kind. Very few are uniformly good, or uniformly wicked;
therefore, all who are not have both follies and vices mixed with ſome good
qualities, Our follies are always agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <pb n="121" facs="tcp:1185300302:123"/> to us, but
though all vices are the conſequence of them, we deteſt the vice itſelf,
while we hug the folly that may have cauſed it. Cloſe however as we may
take folly to our hearts, we never fail to be privately aſhamed of
ourſelves for it, nor to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, in the face of the world, our actions to
any thing elſe rather than this hidden cauſe. What power then muſt that
man have over you, who, by encouraging you in your foibles, not only has
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered this pleaſurable deformity you are ſo ſtudious to hide,
but, by gloſſing it over, contrives to make you believe it appears as
agreeable to him as to yourſelf. This man has your heart fully and wholly,
and there is nothing you can deny him.</p>
               <p>This was Mr. Gloſs, who, however he came by it, had this art
in the higheſt perfection, and knew ſo well how and upon whom to play his
game, that he was ever ſure of coming off winner.</p>
               <p>Nor are the talents which form this character of neceſſity
required to be very brilliant, though va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and perſpicuous. They are of
the minor kind: a quickneſs of conception, a cloſe obſervation on men and
manners, ſome ſhrewdneſs, and a good memory compriſing them all: to
which indeed—but that would be a deduction in worthy matters—
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1185300302:124"/> muſt be indiſpenſibly added, frontleſs impudence
and a total want of feeling.</p>
               <p>Any man with theſe in his poſſeſſion, if he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
himſelf in nothing but this purſuit, will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to as great perfection in
the noble art of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon mankind, as will raiſe him to that degree of
conſequence he may think proper.</p>
               <p>Theſe qualifications ſtood with Mr. Gloſs in the place of
Fortune, and with theſe he turned that fickle lady's wheel as he thought
proper.</p>
               <p>Will not the reader begin to feel uncomfortable when, in
conformity to that veracity which all hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians ſhould critically keep in
view, I am obliged to declare that this was the gentleman Mr. Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt had
in his eye as a huſband for Annette.</p>
               <p>Charles, Figgins, and Mr. Gloſs were inſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. The
latter cut a prodigious figure. He had an elegant chariot, half a dozen
footmen, and might have been taken for a newly arrived nabob. It was an
extraordinary thing, however, that go where they would, though he was ſure to
run up a moſt expenſive reckoning, he, by ſome careleſſneſs or
other, conſtantly left his purſe at home, ſo that <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1185300302:125"/>
he preſently became indebted to Charles more than two hundred pounds in odds
and ends of this kind.</p>
               <p>This paſſed off as eccentricity, and as he had a moſt
agreeable apparent indolence of mind, which, by the way, was what Kiddy would
have called a copy of his countenance, he appeared to our hero the moſt
delightful companion he had ever met with.</p>
               <p>It was agreed that Charles, with Figgins as a companion,
ſhould, early in the ſpring, ſet out to make a tour of Europe, in which
he ventured to expreſs a very ſtrong wiſh that Mr. Gloſs would
accompany him.</p>
               <p>This however could not be. That gentleman was in treaty for a
borough, which a member was expected every day to vacate in his favour.
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he had requeſted Sir Sidney to cheapen an eſtate for him in
Warwickſhire, and he was curſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afraid that a certain woman of
condition, that he ſaid ſhould be nameleſs—and ſo ſhe well
might, for ſhe was not in exiſtence—would inſiſt upon a kind of a
half promiſe he had made, and nooſe him; which matter, he ſaid, were it
really ſerious, he verily believed would drive him abroad; for he did 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1185300302:126"/> not think the poſſeſſion of the fineſt and
richeſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the kingdom a compenſation for the loſs of any man's
liberty of his figure and conſequence.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>CONSISTING OF ADVICE AND AN ADIEU TO ENGLAND.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE ſpring put an end to thoſe town enjoyments which had
employed the leiſure hours of our hero and his connections, and now Charles
and his friend Figgins began to prepare for an excurſion to thoſe parts of
the world where true politeneſs is thought to be native, ſo heartily do
Engliſhmen reprobate the manners of their own country, though they ſo
dearly love its principles.</p>
               <p>It was ſettled that our hero ſhould go on to Italy, by the
borders of Flanders, and not ſee Paris till on his return to England, through
the heart of France; as it was thought, by that means, he would the better
taſte the pleaſures of that capital.</p>
               <p>Charles's heart was fully ſet on this tour, and, for ſeveral
days, it was the general topic of all the friends. He received the good
wiſhes and advice of all with great thankfulneſs. Sir Sidney, with 
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1185300302:128"/> the heartieſt friendſhip, entreated him not to
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft French manners upon an Engliſh cion. He begged of him to hear,
ſee, and conſider; to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and adopt whatever mended the heart, but to
reject with contempt all that merely went to deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the perſon. He ſaid
a flattering exterior was a dangerous thing, and there were ſometimes more
art and deſign under a feather, than any graver de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration of the head. He
ſaid the whole character of the French was comprehended in minutiae; that
this rendered them at firſt ſight agreeable, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards neceſſary, and
at length, to credulous men, endearing, but to the penetrating trifling and
tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>Sir Sidney ſaid he would not wiſh for a better authority for
pronouncing a man weak and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant than his having a ſtrong attachment,
upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated trials, to the French in general. They were, he ſaid, polite
without good manners; acquainted with every thing, though perfect in nothing;
pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one moment and cheating the next; holding you in their arms, and
laughing over your ſhoulder; gay with deſign; accommodating with arrogance;
apparently open, but really hypocritical; aſſuming with meanneſs. In
ſhort, he ſaid their lives were a mixture of pride and ſervility;
ſelf-conſequence and adulation; ſtatelineſs and cringing;
proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="127" facs="tcp:1185300302:129"/> and inſincerity; and though their
ſports were the ſports of children, their miſchief was the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of
monkies.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Happy the man then, ſir,' ſaid Charles,
'who, like you, can ſenſibly diſcriminate between the extremes of this
motley character, and retain ſo much of it for his own uſe as ſhall make
him wary in his dealings with the world, without being
diſhonourable.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I know not,' ſaid Sir Sidney, 'whether I
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your compliment, but this is the very effect I would wiſh the
French manners to have upon you, who, however cautioned, will, I fear, from the
openneſs of your heart, and your ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to find men what they
ought to be, take, without examination, that droſs which the French ſo very
eaſily contrive to paſs for ſterling. As to Italy, ſee every valuable
picture, ſtatue, and ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; hear all that is excellent in muſic,
admire the country, and come away, leſt, excluſive of the danger to your
own morals, you are obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that the moſt beautiful, and once
the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, place in the world, is now the moſt infamous.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lady Roebuck, who truly regarded Charles as her ſon, as much
from inclination as from a promiſe <pb n="128" facs="tcp:1185300302:130"/> made to Lady Hazard
on her death bed, gave him only general advice as to his youth and
inexperience, relying however on his ſtrong good ſenſe, and that
rectitude of heart which, as we have already noticed, was remarkable in ſo
young a man. She promiſed to keep Annette firmly to her ſentiments of
eſteem for him, and doubted not but his conduct would warrant all her
exertions in the promotion of his happineſs; and finally, that Annette
improved at home, and he abroad, there could be no doubt of their making one of
the moſt happy, as well as ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant couples in the world.</p>
               <p>Emma warned him againſt the jays of France and the
nightingales of Italy. She ſaid ſhe foreſaw that, if his heart was not
ſteel and adamant, he would be ruined; that ſhe had read his mind
thoroughly, and plainly ſaw that the only vice he had in the world was want
of deceit. It was, to be ſure, a ſtrange declaration, but it was very true.
That ſhe ſhould not wonder at any thing he became in the hands of the
French and Italians; for he was ſuch pliable wax that any man, with a
plauſible ſtory, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which could be deduced from a good
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, might ſhape him into any form. She begged of him, in particular, to
beware of holy hypocrites. What ſhe had read, ſhe told him, of their
cruelty and diſſoluteneſs, was yet worſe, if poſſible, than all 
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1185300302:131"/> the gambols with which the forms of their facetious
religion ſeemed to burleſque its author: or rather, the author of that
which they daringly ventured to innovate, and which involved a ſyſtem of
morality mild as mercy, and benignant as his holy name who eſtabliſhed it.
Above all ſhe cautioned him againſt convents, and an intercourſe with
thoſe drones of ſociety the inmates of them, who, from leiſure to plan,
and inclination to execute, were the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators of every ſpecies of
profligacy and miſchief. Her reading, ſhe ſaid, had induced her to
believe that there were more than three hundred thouſand cloyſtered clergy
in France, and a proportionable number of females; that the wickedneſs, the
attro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wickedneſs carried on within thoſe walls, which were
ſuppoſed to immure ſaints, was ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to humanity.</p>
               <p>Emma further obſerved that it could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that
any thing like the licentious infamy of France and Italy could ever have been
practiſed here, becauſe England had, properly ſpeaking, never been the
ſeat of that dangerous religion; but let it be recollected, in the reign of
Henry the Eighth, what barbarous, what deteſtable veſtiges of popiſh
profligacy were diſcovered at the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing Netley abbey, and many other
convents.—Subterraneous communications for nightly viſits 
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1185300302:132"/> from friars to nuns, and nuns to friars. Hidden infants
apparently murdered. If then the plant, which was here an exotic, grew to
ſuch perfection, how muſt it flouriſh in its native ſoil. It was
hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to think of it!</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'But,' added Emma, if I may credit what I have
read, this moſt unholy, irreverent, indecent, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous religion, is
clearly where it exiſts a jeſt with all but the ſuperſtitious ignorant.
What is the mode of chooſing a pope but a blaſphemous impoſition, in
which, one would think, to puniſh them for preſumptuouſly daring to give
out that their election is from heaven, they once, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration no doubt,
as well as upon all other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, choſe a woman, who betrayed her
ſex, their ſhame, and opened the eyes of every one who choſe to ſee.
But <hi>vive la bagatelle</hi> in that, as in every thing elſe, ſoon got
the better of good ſenſe and ſound reaſon, and they went on electing
popes, the choice of heaven; not however with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking a precaution, leſt
heaven ſhould have again deceived them.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Emma's precautions were applauded by a burſt of laughter, and
Charles entreated her to make herſelf perfectly eaſy, giving her his word
that he would take particular care that his ſmall plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1185300302:133"/> of underſtanding ſhould not be eaten up by theſe
black locuſts.</p>
               <p>Annette took an innocent but tender leave of her lover; for Emma
had ever encouraged her not to be aſhamed of a truly virtuous paſſion.
Our hero felt himſelf greatly charmed at the diſtinction, and exulted not a
little at reflecting that after time and experience ſhould have prepared him
with manly and proper reſolutions, and given him riper quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mind and
perſon, the poſſeſſion of ſo charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an object would be within
his reach. Many were their mutual proteſtations: ardent, yet inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
heartfelt, yet reaſonable. At length they ſeparated, with a promiſe to
write to each other, and with vows of inviolable fidelity.</p>
               <p>One audience now only ſtood with Lord Hazard, before the time
when our hero was to depart. This interview was without witneſs. My lord took
his ſon tenderly by the hand, ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">'My dear Charles, lowered as I am by my grief,
wretched by calamity, and diſordered by both, my merits are more than
rewarded by having you for my ſon. I never made you a ſtranger to my
youthful exceſſes; indeed it would perhaps be policy to paint them to you
even in their ſtrongeſt colours, that you might ſhun the certain ruin
that awaits <pb n="132" facs="tcp:1185300302:134"/> ſuch profligacy. Your incomparable mother,
now no more, was—I cannot think of it but my ſoul is in
arms—given me to bleſs my repentant heart with comfort more than ſuch
a wretch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; yet did I, after the enjoyment of ſuch bliſs, ſuch
unexampled delight, daſh the cup of happineſs from my lips, in the very
moment that it held for me all the bleſſings of life in one deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
draught.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Wonder not at my words, Charles, it is very
true; your mother owes her death to me!—to your father!—to your
wretched culpable father! He who ſhould from duty, from gratitude, from a
ſenſe of his own honour, her virtues, her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic virtues, have avoided
like contagion the moſt diſtant means that could wound her mind the
thouſandth part of a moment, much leſs join with wretches, with infamous
deteſtable wretches, to work the deſtruction of her peace, and then her
life! Oh look with pity,' cried he, in agony, injured, martyred ſaint, and
calm the woes that tear me!—that deſtroy me!—that feed me with
ſuch torturing remorſe as would make me think annihilation a bleſſing!
My dear boy thou art aſtoniſhed.'—</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I am indeed ſir,' ſaid Charles; 'but it
cannot <pb n="133" facs="tcp:1185300302:135"/> be; I know ſir it is impoſſible. The fixed,
the ſolemn melancholy with which my indeed incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable mother's death has
ſhaded your brow, makes you ſee every thing through a ſadly deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
medium, and you think the irregularities of your youth ſat near her heart.
But cheer away this melancloly, my lord and father: let me fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go my intention
of travelling, and ſtay to comfort you by my watchful and tender duty. I will
ſwear to have no joy, no employment, but the dear pleaſing taſk of
exhauſting all my little talents to divert and ſoften your

               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'My good, my noble boy,' ſaid Lord Hazard, I
cannot now enjoy a ſingle glimpſe of happineſs but that which reſults
from reflecting how great, how illuſtrious a figure you will one day make. My
heart is ſet on your travelling, and the letters I ſhall receive from you
will be all my comfort. As for the reſt, time and reflection, ſweeted by
the friendſhip of Sir Sidney, may reſtore my health—which I will
endeavour to preſerve for thy ſake—but nothing can give me back my
peace of mind. This unhappy buſineſs, which was not a youthful folly, but a
relapſe of honour:—Poor boy, I little thought, when I was ſchooling
thee, how much I ſtood in need of a tutor myſelf. But my words, like my
deeds, want connection. I <pb n="134" facs="tcp:1185300302:136"/> was going to ſay I would

               </p>
               <p>Charles acceeded to the terms, and pledged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before

ſake of conſiſtency—half ſo well qualified to ſuſtain their
parts, or half ſo perfect in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:1185300302:140"/> Charles had not twice changed horſes in
his way to Dover before he had much welcome cauſe to be charmed with the
ſolicitude of his friend. Figgins well knew that to treat a diſorder in the
mind, he muſt have recourſe to a practice the very reverſe of that
generally adopted with relation to the body; therefore, inſtead of
nauſeous, unpalatable draughts, in which one would think its profeſſors
imagined conſiſt all the ſecrets of phyſic, he ſtudiouſly went
about to prepare all that he conceived would charm the heart and expand the
liberal mind of our hero. He drew him from his ſilence by degrees; extolled
in the higheſt terms of admiration his filial piety; repreſented the
condition of his father as the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a truly amiable mind, formerly
irregular indeed, but now reſtored to the exerciſes of reaſon and
benevolence; he drew a warm picture of both the power and the will of Sir
Sidney to ſooth all his cares; and finally, painted the extreme
ſatisfaction that would reſult to him by a contemplation that he had one
ſon who would become ſo great an honour to him as to make noble amends for
the obloquy caſt upon his name by the deſpicable ignorance and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible conduct of the other.</p>
               <p>After ſeveral ſimilar preparations, he began to enter upon
the grand ſubject, and at length made his young friend perfectly ſenſible
for what purpoſe <pb n="139" facs="tcp:1185300302:141"/> they were then in the poſt
chaiſe. France and all its gaieties began inſenſibly to blend in their
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and Figgins archly remarked that gravity was an exotic which
certainly would not flouriſh in ſo ſmiling a climate.</p>
               <p>Charles was ever remarkably tenacious of not permitting his
private feelings to inconvenience his friends, and the leſs he conceived
himſelf obliged to reſtraint by a man's preſence, the more forward he was
to ſhew that his attention was voluntary.—He felt Figgins's kindneſs,
and began to unbend. Beſides, he had high health, and brilliant ſpirits;
and however ſincerely he might grieve at heart when he reflected—which
he certainly very often did for his time of life—ſorrow caught but
little apparent hold on his volatile mind.</p>
               <p>Being arrived at Dover, they beſpoke a paſſage boat to
themſelves for the next morning, and while it was yet day-light took a walk
to ſee that cliff which Emma had convinced herſelf, by her read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though
now the boundary of the channel, had certainly, in former times, made a part of
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
               <p>On their return to ſupper, the landlady informed them that a
young lady, attended by a footman and <pb n="140" facs="tcp:1185300302:142"/> a female
ſervant, had arrived ſince their departure, and finding that our travellers
had engaged the only paſſage boat on the Dover ſide, expreſſed an
anxious wiſh that ſhe might be permitted to go half the expence of the
veſſel, and ſail with that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for that her affairs called for
expedition; and ſhe had been alſo informed that as the wind blew right into
Calais harbour there would be no chance of any arrival from thence.</p>
               <p>It will eaſily be conceived that the requeſt was inſtantly
complied with, though not the terms of it. A genteel compliment was inſtantly
returned to the lady, with an earneſt entreaty that ſhe would ſuffer the
gentlemen to wait on her. The interview was permitted, the lady was
complimented with the offer of a paſſage for her and her ſervants, which
it was delicately hinted to her muſt be gratis, and, after as much
heſitation as was due to good breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe accepted the propoſal.</p>
               <p>What Figgins had ſo ſucceſsfully began, this lady
completed. She was young, handſome, and lively, and though there appeared now
and then a little levity in her manner, yet Charles, upon Figgins's
ſuggeſtion, was willing to attribute it to her extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſituation,
the firſt of which they ſoon <pb n="141" facs="tcp:1185300302:143"/> learnt from her own
mouth was French, and the latter that of a widow.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of their converſation, it came out, to the
great ſatisfaction of our travellers, that this young lady, by name St.
Vivier, was born in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and the daughter of a French refugee; that ſhe
married a French gentleman, who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for ſome overt acts in
which he ſtood up for the liberty of the ſubject, but he now being dead,
ſhe was going to ſee what ſhe could collect in France of the ſcattered
remains of his fortune; that her journey was to Lyons, and being obliged to
make ſome ſtay at Sedan, for intelligence among her late huſband's
relations, ſhe ſhould purſue her rout by the borders of Flanders.</p>
               <p>As this was ſtep for ſtep the way that had been marked out
for Charles, what could be ſo fortunate as the above intelligence. This fact
was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, and a propoſal ſuggeſted that they ſhould make that
tour together. It was not however men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned but with the moſt ſuitable
propriety as to preparation and manner. The lady found great difficulty to
believe that her route was really that which our travellers had intended to
take, but ſaw, ſhe ſaid, that they were ſo polite as to alter their
intention in compliment to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:1185300302:144"/> Both Charles and Figgins vehemently
proteſted the truth of their aſſertion, and indeed uſed ſo many
arguments to convince her that it would have been an infringment of that
politeneſs which ſhe ſeemed to poſſeſs in a natural and elegant
degree to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urther doubted their
veracity. The next difficulty was that it would appear very odd if ſhe
ſhould travel in the company of ſtrangers. Charles ſaid ſhe had her own
ſervants with her, and Figgins noticed that they were all alike ſtrangers
in France, where indeed no explanations were ever required when people paid
their way. This ſhe ſaid ſhe ſhould make a point of doing to the
utmoſt farthing, if ſhe conſented at all, but at any rate ſhe muſt
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat till the morning to conſider of the propriety of their propoſal, 
<q rend="inline">'for,' added ſhe, 'a woman of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour cannot
be too cautious, eſpecially in ſuch a licentious country as France has been
deſcribed to me.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this remark both our hero and his friend ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced, and
now ſupper being announced, the lady, after ſome little difficulty, was
prevailed on to partake of it; not however without remarking that matters
muſt be put upon a different footing when they ſhould arrive on the other
ſide of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. To which our hero replied, with a very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
glance, that he ſincerely hoped it would <pb n="143" facs="tcp:1185300302:145"/> be ſo, and,
upon the lady's looking grave, added, ſince it appeared to be her wiſh.</p>
               <p>A ſmart breeze the next day conducted them ſafely to Calais
in ſomething more than three hours, where, after the cuſtomary ceremonies
of entering their names, paying a viſit to the cuſtom-houſe, giving
ſomething in charity, and ſatisfying a few clamorous porters, they were
glad to get hold of ſome <hi>ſoup gras</hi> at Deſſeins, which, as well
as the reſt of their dinner, they found excellent.</p>
               <p>In the evening they went to the play, which was alſo performed
in the ſame inn, where there is a remarkable neat theatre, and by no means
ſmall. During the performance Charles was greatly pleaſed with the remarks
of Madame St. Vivire, who ſpoke French admirably well, and perfectly taſted
the neat nothingneſs of the French little operas, two of which were that
night given. Our hero, who knew alſo that language as well as reading could
teach it him, begged to be this lady's ſcholar for the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical part of it.
She readily agreed, by which means, as he feigned, whenever he found it
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, to know leſs than he did, he had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand opportunities of
indulging himſelf in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witty ſallies, by way of trying how a
declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love would be taken, which he the leſs he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1185300302:146"/> to do, as a widow at her own diſpoſal was fairly out
of his agreement.</p>
               <p>He firſt tried his French eloquence to perſuade her that the
pleaſure of her charming company and the advantage of the rapid improvement
he ſhould make under her tuition would amply overbalance the expences of
their journey. At firſt however ſhe could not think of conſenting to
this, but Charles being ſtrongly ſeconded by Figgins, ſhe at length
agreed.</p>
               <p>This matter ſet Charles more at eaſe, for he was pretty well
aſſured ſhe could not be a woman of very nice honour who would, in this
inſtance, yield to the ſolicitation of two ſtrangers. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
determined to ply her with the whole force of his amorous eloquence. At night
he took notice ſhe ſipped the burgundy pretty freely, which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity he
ſeized to inſinuate ſome bold hints which were not ill received.
Maintaining this ground, he had ſoon reaſon to think the lady would, after
a very ſhort ſiege, ſurrender in form, which hopes were confirmed the
next morning by Figgins, who had already won the lady's woman—both a
handſome and genteel girl—and reaped the fruits of his victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:1185300302:147"/> Charles redoubled his aſſiduity, and
Madam St. Vivier, after holding out with great apparent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, at length
reluctantly promiſed to make him happy on their arrival at Liſle, to which
place, having ſeen every thing at Calais, not forgetting the picture where
the citizens are kneeling to King Edward, with halters about their necks, which
curioſity was recommended to his attention by Emma, they now prepared to
ſet out.</p>
               <p>About an hour before the horſes were to be ready, Mr.
Deſſein begged the favour of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with Charles, which being granted
him, after a proper apology and preparation, he ſaid he had a matter of great
delicacy to communicate, which concerned him nearly.</p>
               <p>Charles expreſſed ſome ſurpriſe at this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and having previouſly promiſed at Deſſein's entreaty, that he would in
no wiſe take the matter ill, he was informed that, ſome months before, a
gentleman came to him one morning, ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">'Mr. Deſſein I have been robbed of thoſe
eighty <hi>louis d'ors</hi> which I yeſterday received from you in a
bag.'</q> He replied it was impoſſible; that his money might probably be
miſlaid, or found by the ſervants, but that in that houſe nobody could be
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1185300302:148"/> robbed. He would make enquiry, he ſaid, and the money
would be reſtored to him.</p>
               <p>The gentleman went out, and at his return Deſſein had eighty
<hi>louis d'ors</hi> ready for him in a bag ſimilar to the other, for money
being in France often paid in three livre and ſix livre pieces, the bankers
have all bags on purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The excuſe made to the gentleman was, that, as the houſe was
very full the evening before, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, after he was aſleep, ſeeing
the bag lie on the ground, had brought it to one of the clerks, who had put it
in the counting houſe; for it ſhould be known that Deſſein is a banker
as well as an inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper. The gentleman, not in the leaſt ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
truth of what he heard, put the money in his pocket, and went away.</p>
               <p>The fact, however, which had been ſo artfully
ſuppreſſed, was this: Deſſein ſaid he ſaw in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the
gentleman had been really robbed, and upon making his enquiries, as to the
ſituation of the lodgers, he found to a certainty by whom. In ſhort, he
ſaid, this crime was committed by a young Engliſh gentleman, heir to a high
title, and a large eſtate; that it could not be for want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, 
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1185300302:149"/> as, no doubt, he might have had what he pleaſed of his
father; but finding himſelf in an immediate neceſſity, inſtead of
applying to him, in which caſe he might have been ſupplied, he took this
ſum without conſidering the conſequences.</p>
               <p>Mr. Deſſein ſaid the reſolution he took upon it was to
ſay nothing upon the ſubject to any perſon till he ſhould ſee the
young gentleman himſelf, for that out of gratitude to the Engliſh, to whom
he owed his all, he would rather loſe ten times that ſum than make a ſtir
about ſuch a trifle, but that having ſeen that young gentleman ſince, and
been treated by him in a very <hi>en cavalier</hi> ſtyle, though he was
determined not to expoſe him, except to his own family, he ſhould now
certainly make no ſcruple of applying for the money.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, he informed our hero, who began now to ſmell a
rat, that Zekiel was the thief.</p>
               <p>What an opportunity is here to put an end to this hiſtory!
Charles had nothing to do but get his brother hanged, to be heir to the family,
title, and eſtate, his marriage with Annette would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of
courſe, and when they had produced half <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1185300302:150"/> a dozen
children, for Lord Hazard to dandle on his knee, and comfort himſelf in his
old age, he would have ſunk peaceably to reſt, and have left his darling
ſon and daughter in poſſeſſion of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
               <p>Whether Charles foreſaw an uniform tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in ſuch a
life, and was determined to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence what ſort of pleaſures are
generally produced by variety, or whether—which is full as
proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—he felt a ſtrong wiſh to hide his unnatural brother's
frailty, we will not enquire. Certain it is, he, without heſitation, repaid
Mr. Deſſein upon the ſpot, thanked him for his prudence, and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented that he was ſorry to ſee his brother poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed ſo
inſolent a ſpirit, but begged he would conſider the whole as an
extravagant <hi>tour de jeuneſſe,</hi> which had more of falſe wit in it
than premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated vice. He deſired that the whole might ſink into
oblivion, and in particular that it might never come to his father's ears.</p>
               <p>Mr. Deſſein promiſed literally to follow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of our hero, with whoſe manner and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity he was very much ſtruck;
and could not help remarking that he plainly ſaw, though 
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1185300302:151"/> the honour was veſted in the elder brother, the
younger poſſeſſed the virtues which could alone enoble a family.</p>

THROUGH THIS LITERARY JOURNEY.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>CHARLES having finiſhed this buſineſs greatly to his
ſatisfaction, determined that no hint ſhould eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape him concerning it,
not even to Figgins; but, leſt future inſtances of his brother's nefarious
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſhould multiply in a ſtrange country, where it would coſt him
dearly to extricate himſelf from ſuch difficulties, he lengthened a letter
he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready written to his father, by firſt very delicately apologizing
for touching on ſuch a ſubject, and then entreating that his brother's
allowance might be augmented, even though his own ſhould be curtailed; for
that it was impoſſible for a man in any ſtyle to cut a figure in
France—particularly a young and inexperienced man—with a ſlender
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. He gave ſome general reaſons for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and, though with
great deference, ſtrongly ſubmitted the matter to his father's
conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:1185300302:153"/> After entreating Mr. Deſſein to
ſend any letters forward for him to Liſle, he took leave of Calais.</p>
               <p>At Liſle they purpoſed ſtaying a few days, and as Charles
promiſed himſelf the poſſeſſion of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame St. Vivier, he was
determined to ſport as grand a figure as his circumſtances would
allow.—He therefore hired a carriage, made parties, and gave <hi>petits
ſoupees</hi> at his inn, which were of courſe frequented by as many
gueſts, particularly officers and abbes, as could beg, borrow, or ſteal
cards of invitation.</p>
               <p>One evening, about half an hour before ſupper, arrived <hi>un
My Lor Anglois,</hi> with a gentleman and lady, two footmen and a maid
ſervant, who could not get ſo elegant a repaſt as they wiſhed, all the
delicacies being taken up by our hero, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited a large party by way of
adieu to Liſle.—Charles, when he came to underſtand the
inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the ſtrangers, of which he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently the
cauſe, upon conſulting Figgins, ſent his compliments and requeſted as a
favour that they would add <hi>ſans facons</hi> to the number of thoſe he
had invited.</p>
               <p>The invitation was as freely accepted as given, the two
gentlemen and the lady preſently appeared, <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1185300302:154"/> and were
received with all that freedom ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in France. The lady was immediately
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the officers, and the gentlemen, who appeared to be true
Engliſh ſportſmen, were hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for any body who could ſpeak a
word of Engliſh. Figgins and our hero relieved their diſtreſs as much as
poſſible. At length ſupper appeared, and preſently one of our bucks
ſaid to the other, 
<q rend="inline">'I ſay, you Tadpole, if I can think how ſo
many people jabber ſo curſe confoundedly with their jaws full.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh, my lord,' ſaid his friend, 'a Frenchman's
jaws are like the tools of a trunk maker, they always make more noiſe than

               </p>
               <p>Figgins gave them a hint that they had better be on their guard,

               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh dam'me,' ſaid my lord, 'the queer lantern

                  <q rend="inline">'<hi>Monſieur,</hi>' anſwered a very polite

                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:1185300302:155"/> The abbe, after paying him the utmoſt

                  <q rend="inline">'He fays he does not underſtand what you

               </p>
               <p> At this moment Madam St. Vivier ſaid 
<q rend="inline">'My Lord Hazard I have the pleaſure of

<q rend="inline">'My dear Madam I thank you; give me leave to

               </p>
               <p> The ſtranger, who was diſputing with Figgins, here cried
out, 
<q rend="inline">'Hey! what's this! Here you Tad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole, how is

dead, ay and before my old put of a father is dead too!'</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:1185300302:156"/> Charles, penetrating in a moment the
whole force of theſe few words, bluſhed with indignation, which Zekiel
perceiving—for the reader ſees it was he—followed the blow he had
given, by ſaying 
<q rend="inline">'Ay, dam'me, fine work; fine times, when every
little whipper ſnapper can ſet up for a lord!'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'True,' ſaid Figgins, who had a mind to give

contemptible it is,'—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Nay,' ſaid Mr. Tadpole, 'you muſt now

better agree to yourſelf, at leaſt for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if it were only in
conſideration of your being my gueſt.'</q>

               <p>

ſuch fine gig as this?'—</q>
                  <q rend="inline">'As much,' ſaid Charles, as I would have
invited you, had I known who you were:—as the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore was
ſent as from ſtranger to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I am willing to give it another turn
to all thoſe who have not underſtood the diſpute, and I am ſure the
whole company will join in laughing it off.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes, and a fine laugh it would be againſt me,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1185300302:158"/> hey Tadpole. No, no, dam'me, I will tell them all about
it. I ſay, Mounſeer, no my lord he—I my lord.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'<hi>Ah ha!</hi>' ſaid an officer, without
underſtanding him.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Dam'me if I ever ſaw ſuch a ſet of fools
in my life,' ſaid Zekiel.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'That man no my lord at all; I am one great,
grand my lord myſelf!'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Very great and very grand indeed,' ſaid
Charles; 'it is pity that nobody knows it.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You are a puppy, Mr. Charles,' ſaid Zekiel:
why the devil don't you help me out, Tadpole? you can jabber a little of their
damned gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beriſh.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Tadpole undertook to inform the company how the matter ſtood,
in which account he certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved very ſcandalouſly, by repreſenting
Zekiel as a lord, and Charles as an impoſtor, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining how
innocently the matter had been fallen into. Here Charles interfered with all
the warmth he could. It was however to no purpoſe. <hi>Ceſt affreux! Jeſu
Maria! Ceſt honteux!</hi> and half a dozen other expreſſions of
aſtoniſhment, were all uttered together, and the whole company agreed that
they had all along feared our hero was a low born fellow by his prodigality. In
ſhort, a thouſand marks of <pb n="157" facs="tcp:1185300302:159"/> attention were
immediately laviſhed upon Zekiel, which being interpreted to him through the
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of Tadpole, he ſwore he never liked French people ſo well in his
life, while Charles, fortified by indignation againſt the apoſtacy of his
gueſts, did not now think it worth his while to undeceive them, but contented
himſelf with taking this as a caution how he ſhould ſummon together a
promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous company in France at his own expence for the future.</p>
               <p>Figgins however was determined it ſhould not go off ſo. He
obſerved that not one of the company, while they beſtowed pretty liberally
the moſt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating epithets on Charles, grudged to eat or drink any thing
they could lay their hands on, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moved that either nothing ſhould
be touched, or that they would accompany every word, in the manner they had
before this diſcovery, with ſome well-turned compliment to him at whoſe
expence they ſat down; for as nothing was expected for ſo ſumptuous an
entertainment but words—a coin in which they were very rich and very
prodigal—he muſt beg, in the name of his friend, that they would fulfil
the conditions of the feaſt, otherwiſe it would induce him to wiſh for a
bill, that every man might pay his reckoning in another coin, with 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1185300302:160"/> which he did not believe they were ſo well
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
               <p>This ſarcaſm gave very high offence, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which they eat and drank on without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to comply with either of Mr.
Figgins's condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till at laſt Zekiel, to whom they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
through Tadpole, offered to pay his ſhare, and invited his new friends to
follow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>His adherents began now to forſake him; no one came into his
propoſal, and all eyes were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fixed again upon Charles, who
ſeeing what ſort of turn matters were likely to take, got up, and ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'Come gentlemen, I will end the
diſpute:—Is it not fair that he ſhould be conſidered as the true
Lord Hazard who pays the bill?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>A general affirmative was inſtantly given, and Zekiel being
aſked if he would pay the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the evening out of his pocket,
anſwered he would ſee ſuch a ſet of mounſeers and madames at the
devil firſt. Charles then called the waiter, who ſaid there was nothing to
pay, for that his honour had ſatisfied every thing, as well for the ſupper
as the dance and little opera that would enter in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:1185300302:161"/> Zekiel now under went a thouſand
mortifications, which he contented himſelf with returning by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, in a
language the Frenchmen could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. At length he ſneaked off to
bed, vowing revenge againſt his brother, which Mr. Fluſh, who, as we have
ſaid, was a follower of his fortunes, aſſured him, as he aſcended the
gallery, was eaſily practicable.</p>
               <p>I have already ſaid Charles had reaſon to believe that
Madame St. Vivier would at Liſle recompenſe his attention, by conſenting
to make him happy upon his own terms. That very night ſhew was to comply with
his wiſhes, and this ſecret, by a means I ſhall take an opportunity one
time or other to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, Mr. Fluſh had diſcovered, and now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted it
to Zekiel, who getting inſtructions as to the ſituation of all the
different bed-chambers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſupplant his brother.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of this determination, when all was ſilent in
the inn, he went to the room where he had been directed, and finding it
invitingly open, faſtened the door on the inſide, and groped about till he
found the bed. Being accoſted by a female voice, in a whiſper, he replied
in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He then undreſt himſelf, and was welcomed into bed
as warmly as he could wiſh. In about <pb n="160" facs="tcp:1185300302:162"/> half an hour
after, another perſon knocked ſoftly at the door, whom he of courſe
gueſſed to be his brother Charles; but, adviſing the lady not to take the
ſmalleſt notice of this intruſion, after a ſhort time the importunate
viſitant gave over knocking, and went away.</p>
               <p>He began now to glory in his ſucceſs, and had a great mind
to ſtay and brazen the whole matter out, but was ſo earneſtly entreated
by the lady to ſpare her delicacy, and to leave her before the day dawned,
that he at length complied.</p>
               <p>Elated with this revenge, Zekiel, as he occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
paſſed our hero in the morning, could not help looking big, and half
inſulting him. Charles bore every thing very patiently, till, being obliged
to anſwer an impertinent queſtion or two, a very provoking altercation
enſued, and Zekiel ventured a moſt invidious and wanton invective againſt
the memory of Charles's mother. Scarcely were the words out of his mouth, when
our hero fairly knocked him down, and indeed was ſo tranſported with
paſſion, that he ſwore he would not reſt a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till he had
ſacrificed ſo infamous a raſcal to the offended laws.</p>
               <p>Zekiel being again upon his legs, came up and 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1185300302:163"/> demanded what he meant by that. Charles bid him aſk
Monſieur Deſſein. At theſe words Zekiel was in a cold ſweat, and
trembled from head to foot, and was actually upon the point of confeſſing
the robbery when Figgins and Mr. Tadpole came up-Seeing this, Charles, in the
language of Tamerlane, bade him keep his own wicked ſecret, and be ſafe;
and aſking Mr. Tadpole which way they intended to go to England, and being
anſwered by the way of Oſtend, he adviſed him, for the ſake of his
friend, to keep that reſolution.</p>
               <p>Figgins plainly ſaw there was ſome hidden mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this
expreſſion, and had indeed, though he had not betrayed it, thought a little
myſteriouſly of the <hi>tete a tete</hi> interview between Charles and
Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Deſſein; to which another circumſtance that occurred at
Liſle being added, he thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to tax Charles with want of
confidence, and puſhing the matter while it was warm, he obtained from our
hero, who was the worſt qualified in the world for a hypocrite, the whole
truth.</p>
               <p>Figgins thanked him for his frankneſs, and ſaid that in
return he would give him ſome intelligence relative to Maſter Zekiel that
would not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:1185300302:164"/> He ſaid, that being all well fluſhed
the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, every one ſeemed to have his different appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For
his part, he had made an aſſignation with Kitty, Madame St. Vivier's maid,
which he went to keep, but, by ſome accident or other, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the
chamber, he had certainly introduced himſelf to Miſs Tadpole, who, it was
plain, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſomebody; for, upon finding it impoſſible to anſwer
many of her queſtions, ſhe was at firſt in manifeſt confuſion, but
ſoon recovering herſelf, gave a turn to the unintelligible part of her
conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and, in direct terms, made him underſtand that ſhe took
him for Zekiel, though what ſhe ſaid was ſo worded that he plainly ſaw
this was the firſt interview of that nature which had paſſed, and which
ſhe was evidently ſurpriſed into, owing to her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſome
other perſon.</p>
               <p>Taking the hint, therefore, he paſſed himſelf on her for
my lord, which indeed ſpoilt all his ſcheme of pleaſure for the remainder
of the night, except ſo much as gratified his curioſity; for having yielded
to his embraces before matters came to be explained, ſhe took on ſtrangely,
and complained of being ruined in her ſleep, and all the old cant of thoſe
ladies who are well verſed in ſuch arts as paſs off their ſtale ware to
inexperienced young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:1185300302:165"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I topped my part,' ſaid Figgins, 'for
learning from her all thoſe vows and promiſes which your precious brother
has made her, I confirmed them with a number of his quaint oaths, and at length
left her apparently ſatisfied.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I ſhould not forget to mention that after I
had been ſometime in bed, a knocking and a voice was heard at the chamber
door, on which, in her fright, ſhe ſaid <q rend="inline">"that is my brother, I know his voice"</q>—'and ſo, by the way, did I. She would have let
him in, to have witneſſed the proteſtations I had made her. This however
I overruled, and after a time the brother—for I dare ſay it was
he—went away; but, upon putting all conſiderations together, I am
convinced this Mr. Tadpole is the lady's gallant, and they are trying together
to nooſe your brother, which, upon my ſoul, I think, for the ſake of the
family, ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Charles agreed to this, and ſaid if Mr. Figgins would confront
the lady on their return—for they were now on the ramparts—he
would, in ſpight of his inward indignation for his brother, try to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
him, and ſo ſave him from this infamy, that ſeemed to await him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:1185300302:166"/> Figgins ſaid he was an excellent young
man, and he would ſecond ſo laudable an endeavour with all his heart. 
<q rend="inline">'But,' ſaid Figgins, 'now we are on the
ſubject of laſt night, you, I find, kept my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; for Kitty tells
me this morning that ſome perſon ſtole into her room, whom ſhe
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took for me, but, finding her error—but not till ſhe had
yielded—made the beſt of it, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured the miſtake.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'This is ſingular enough,' ſaid Charles, 'I
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you it was not I; I was much better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Are you ſure of it?' ſaid
Figgins.—</q>
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh certain,' ſaid Charles. 'My
aſſignation was no myſterious one; I had no occaſion to ſhroud my
deſigns in darkneſs, for the joys I reaped were heightened by the bluſhes
of my miſtreſs, which were revealed to my view by a wax taper, which I dare
ſay was bought for a very different cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Then by God,' ſaid Figgins, 'it was your
brother, who dubbed me with my harlot, while J was dubbing him by anticipation
with his wife, and I am damnably miſtaken if he has not had ſuch
anticipaters in the lady's favours for any time this four years.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This converſation brought them back to the inn, where they
found their whole benevolent deſign <pb n="165" facs="tcp:1185300302:167"/> rendered abortive,
for Zekiel and his company had in their abſence ſet out, and were now
ſeveral miles on their journey towards Oſtend.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Let them go,' ſaid Figgins, 'and ſince the
fellow will run his noſe into the matrimonial gin, let him ſqueak for it;
but I hope, while I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate his folly, I am not glancing at any in you.
Madame St. Vivier and you are evidently upon very kind terms; I need not hint
to your good ſenſe that ſhe is a mere adventurer..'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Oh,' ſaid Charles, 'that one may plainly
ſee: I ſhould like however to know her real ſtory.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'That, for your ſake, I have diſcovered,'
ſaid Figgins.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Madame St. Vivier and her maid are neither more
nor leſs than Aimwell and Archer in the Beaux Stratagem. They are travelling
to the ſouth of France, by the way of Lyons, which route I believe they take
ſimply becauſe it is ours. On their return, by the way of Paris, Mrs. Kitty
is to be the miſtreſs, and Madame St. Vivier the maid, and whatever they
pick up in their journey they are to go ſnacks in. The girl acknowledges to
me that the firſt idea was to trap you into a marriage, but finding we were
too knowing for them, and in facts better calculated to adminiſter to their
pleaſure than their convenience, like a <pb n="166" facs="tcp:1185300302:168"/> couple of
generous girls as they are, every thing it ſeems is to be left to
ourſelves.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Which generoſity they muſt not repent,'
ſaid Charles.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'By no means,' ſaid Figgins; 'and if in our
way we meet with any Engliſh booby, not your brother, let them in God's name
profit of their good fortune.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This introduced ſome general remarks on En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh travellers,
which Madame St. Vivier inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Figgins acquainted her with the
diſcovery as to her ſcheme, and both the gentlemen aſſured her they
would aſſiſt it as far as they could, without injuring their characters
as men of honour.</p>
               <p>Poſt horſes were ordered to be ready the next morning. While
they were harneſſing, Charles having occaſion to pay the civility of an
adieu to a perſon in power, who had done him ſome kindneſs as to his
buſineſs at the cuſtom-houſe, and other matters, had the curioſity to
call himſelf at the poſt office, for he had not yet received a ſingle
letter from his father, though he had written ſeveral.—He was there
informed that there had been letters, but they were fetched away by a footman,
in a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exactly like his own, the day before. Charmed with theſe
tidings, he flew back to the inn, think-that <pb n="167" facs="tcp:1185300302:169"/> the footman
muſt have been John, who had forgot to give them to him; but how great was
his ſurpriſe when John aſſured him he had received no letters, and
offered to go back to the poſt-office to rectify the miſtake, whither they
immediately ſet out, Figgins begging them to be expeditious, for the horſes
were put to. 
<q rend="inline">'But ſtay Charles,' added Figgins, 'I will
tell you, as ſure as you are alive, how the caſe is. Your brother's livery
is the ſame as yours; he has intercepted your letters, and is now gone the
devil knows where; and ſo the unnatural wretch, while you were ſaving his
reputation, and perhaps his life, by your unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled liberality, in the
affair of Deſſein—owing I dare ſay to the cunning of the fellow who
tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels with him, for he has not head enough him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—has hit upon
this treacherous plan to make a breach between you and your father.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'It muſt be ſo,' ſaid Charles, 'but that
we may be ſure I will write to Deſſein, to know if he has ſent any
letters, and his anſwer ſhall be addreſſed to Bruſſels.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well thought,' ſaid Figgins, 'we can do that
from the next poſt.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'But ſtay ſir,' ſaid John, 'I wiſh I

Nor will the reader be at a loſs how much to lay to the account of it, when
he is told that this was the very John who, upon a former occaſion, reſcued
Lady Hazard, and refuſed Dogbolt's half-guinea.</p>
               <p>The laſt is not the only hint contained in this chapter to
which I would have the reader minutely attend. It may be neceſſary probably
to revert to it in the courſe of the work; but if it tend to any material

               <p>ALL theſe circumſtances together having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Charles
in his opinion that Figgins was a ſincere friend, John a faithful ſervant,
and Zekiel a great rogue, our travellers took the road to Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and at
the firſt ſtage our hero wrote to Mr. Deſſein, as he had
reſolved.</p>
               <p>As I am writing the hiſtory of Charles Hazard, and not a tour
on the continent, I ſhall trouble my readers with no more than ſuch
circumſtances as immediately concern that young gentleman, or lead to his
affairs, together with ſuch minutiae as naturally produced them, and ſuch
remarks as may ſerve for their elucidation.</p>
               <p>In conformity to theſe rules, I ſhall only ſay that at
Bruſſels nothing happened of conſequence enough <pb n="170" facs="tcp:1185300302:172"/>
for me to record except that Charles and Figgins became intimate with a young
Frenchman, named Combrie, who had ſtollen a nun, and married her. This couple
were glad enough to have eſcaped from France with ſafety, without ſtaying
to accompliſh a deſign which they had formed of getting the lady's fortune
out of the hands of a truſtee, in which the church had placed it. They were
therefore little better off than in the poſſeſſion of an unbounded
ſtock of love, and what money Mr. Combrie, who was the <hi>cadet</hi> of an
honourable family, had been able to procure from the fondneſs of a doating
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Having however violated one of the moſt ſacred laws of
France, by carrying a nun out of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the mettled Frenchman conceived
he could incur but little more blame if he puſhed his point ſo far as to
take her fortune forcibly out of the hands of a litigeous <hi>procureur,</hi>
who had made uſe of the money to his own advantage for two years, and eluded
every attempt, even of the clergy, to get it from him.</p>
               <p>The man of the law was however too vigilant and circumſpect
for Combrie, who being a novice in a matter which required ſo much wary
caution and prudent reſolution, and beſides too much <pb n="171" facs="tcp:1185300302:173"/>
tranſported with his expected happineſs, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged his plan ſo
bunglingly, that ſo far from ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with the <hi>procureur,</hi> he
had very nearly been defeated in his views concerning the lady.</p>
               <p>Though this couple loved each other with perhaps more
tenderneſs for being without fortune, yet moſt people agree, and they could
not but yield to the general opinion, that money is a ſecurity for love,
eſpecially after reflection takes place. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, being in a ſtrange
country, from whence they muſt ſhortly, for the ſake of ſafety, recede
further, they were not ſo blinded by their affection, but they ſaw that
their future proſpects would be in a very doubtful way, if ſome ſcheme
was not hit upon to reſcue the money before it could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated for
the uſe of the church.</p>
               <p>Combrie, who had been at Bruſſels but a ſhort time, yet
who was looked upon, in conſequence of his ſhyneſs, as a very equivocal
character, ſaw plainly the danger of making a confident in that place, and as
an attempt at the recovery of his wife's fortune would be impracticable,
without a confederate or two, taking a hint from the ſtrong congeniality that
appeared between the ſentiments of our travellers and his own, he fancied he
ſhould be ſafe at-leaſt in their confidence, even if they did 
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1185300302:174"/> not lend him aſſiſtance. Beſides, his affairs
were very preſſing, and he doubted, if his reſolutions were not
ſuddenly and effectually taken, whether the all-graſping power of the
church would not deprive him of every poſſible hope.</p>
               <p>Having no time to deliberate, and being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened by the
engaging freedom and true breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Charles and his friend, he ventured,
without reſerve, to entruſt them with his affairs, into which our friends
gave ſo freely, that Figgins, who the reader knows was no mean hand at a
plot, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one that it was agreed would infallibly ſucceed, even
without rendering either him or his friend liable to the ſmalleſt
ſuſpicion of being concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Full of their project, the three friends ſet out, leaving
Madame Combrie in her apartments at Bruſſels, but firſt ſending Madame
St. Vivier before them to Sedan, where ſhe actually had buſineſs; for as
to themſelves, out of ſafety to Combrie, they travelled to Nancy in
Lorraine, where lay the ſcene of action, by the way of Luxembourg, and, in
fact, as much in Auſtria as poſſible till they ſhould come to Metz,
where they were to hold their grand counſel of war. Madame St. Vivier,
however, was not at all apprized of their buſineſs, but only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1185300302:175"/> after ſhe had accompliſhed hers, to meet them at
Nancy, to which Sedan lies in the direct road.</p>
               <p>Without ſtopping to look at a ſingle proſpect, building,
or even crucifix, in the way, I ſhall ſet down my travellers at Metz,
where, by agreement, they ſeparated, Charles and Figgins taking poſt
horſes for Nancy, and Combrie jogging after them at his leiſure, upon his
own horſe: not however till they had agreed whereabout they ſhould find him
in the ſuburbs, near which place Combrie had a truſty friend, who he was
ſure would give him every neceſſary aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Being arrived at Nancy, they went to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Chartreux,
where ſtrangers, eſpecially of condition, are for a ſhort time treated
gratis. The members of this convent being all men of fortune, and, in general,
ſuch as have retired from the world through diſappointments at court, are
always charmed at the arrival of new gueſts, whether their viſits be owing
to curioſity or neceſſity, but they are particularly pleaſed with the
Engliſh. No wonder then that the ſuperior, when he underſtood that
Charles was a young Engliſh nobleman, and Figgins his governor; that they had
unexpectedly been deceived as to remittances from England, and 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1185300302:176"/> therefore from actual neceſſity had intruded on
their generous inſtitution, both for immediate ſuccour and advice,
inſtantly ſignified—eſpecially as their pretenſions were
corroborated by the teſtimony of letters of credit and recommendation, and
many other authentic documents—his warmeſt wiſhes to enter heartily
into their intereſt. They paid him a number of acknowledgments for his great
civility to ſtrangers, and ſaid they piqued themſelves on their own
ſagacity, which had pointed out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of applying to a man of his
piety, as well as conſequence, upon ſuch an occaſion, rather than run the
riſk of being impoſed upon by an indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate choice of a perſon to
ſupply their preſent wants, without an eligible recommendation.</p>
               <p>After this preface our travellers acquainted the ſuperior that
they wiſhed his reference to ſome money negociator, for a preſent
ſupply, who aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that it would give him particular pleaſure
to recommend them to ſome perſon who ſhould treat them
conſcientiouſly, mentioned his near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation Monſieur Goufre, <hi>le
procureur:</hi> not however till he had expatiated on the wickedneſs of
thoſe uſurious wretches who take advantage of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitous, and
oppreſs their fellow creatures under the idea of relieving them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:1185300302:177"/> Figgins ſaid he had heard of one
Monſieur Banc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſec, but the ſuperior aſſured them they could not get
into worſe hands. Charles ſaid certainly it would be their intereſt to
rely upon the ſuperior's advice, and begged the favour of a note to
Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Goufre. This requeſt was immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, and our
friends went their ways to the gentleman's houſe in queſtion, after
thanking the kind recluſe in terms of the warmeſt gratitude.</p>
               <p>Before however we introduce the reader to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Goufre, it
will not be inexpedient to ſay how Charles and his friend happened to get
recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the very man who retained Madame Combrie's fortune.</p>
               <p>The reader has ſeen that he was a near relation to the
ſuperior of the <hi>Chartreux,</hi> which was well known to Combrie, and it
will not appear extraordinary that this connection with the clergy ſhould be
the means of Monſieur Goufre's being often employed in matters which
concerned the church. In fact, the frequent litigations by friends of the
deceaſed to recover monies conditionally left for charitable uſes, on one
ſide, and the aſſertion of the church's right on the other, had, upon
many occaſions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſuch a ſee-ſaw of intereſted altercation
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>procureur</hi> and the <hi>ſuperieur,</hi> that matters 
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1185300302:178"/> perfectly plain and clear in themſelves, often wore an
air of ſuch myſterious embarraſſment under ſuch deluſion as
frittered large legacies into bills of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, which were cunningly
ſnacked by the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer and the monk.</p>
               <p>One of theſe lucrative bones, at which they had been a long
time nibbling, was Madame Combrie's fortune, the perfect ſituation of which,
nay even the drawer in which it was depoſited, Figgins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to procure
intelligence of; to do which, properly, they had recourſe to the ſuperior,
and through him were reſolved to attack the heart of his relation in that
part where he was moſt vulner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able—for it was not true that they
actually wanted money—and to give a colour to this it was no bad plan to
ſeize an opportunity of taking the <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treux</hi> by the outward
ſymbol of his profeſſion, and make his charity, which was counterfeit,
the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his real confuſion.</p>
               <p>Combrie being arrived in the Fauxbourg, and informed of their
reſolves, the moment came to put their deſign in execution. Charles and
Figgins waited on the <hi>procureur,</hi> who, after all the neceſſary
difficulties, which, upon motion, was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by Monſieur Deſſein,
agreed to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date them with what they ſhould think neceſſary; 
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1185300302:179"/> for they had repreſented that they ſhould change
their route ſo often, and probably from momentary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, that it would
be better to take up in ſpecie as much as would ſerve for ſome months,
and leave in the hands of Monſieur Goufre travell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bills of Sir James
Herries, and other Engliſh bankers, to the amount of the ſum and the
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>Nothing retarded the payment of the money but waiting for a
letter from Monſieur Deſſein, which at length arrived greatly to the
ſatisfaction of all parties. It ſpoke very handſomely of Charles and his
friend, and it is proper to mention that, over and above the buſineſs of
aſſuring Monſieur Goufre, it mentioned that letters had been ſent to
Charles at Liſle, on account of which he had written to Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and
this confirmed Charles in his opinion of Zekiel's treachery. Figgins however
made a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent uſe of this circumſtance, greatly turning it to their
preſent account, for he proved very clearly that if thoſe letters ſent to
Liſle had been received, the application to Monſieur Goufre would have been
unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>During the interval between writing to Calais and receiving an
anſwer, Charles and Figgins had twice dined with the <hi>procureur,</hi> and
the latter had ſo <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1185300302:180"/> inſinuated himſelf into his good
graces, that under pretence of enquiring into the practice of the French laws,
he wormed out of him almoſt all his affairs. The endowments of the
monaſteries naturally came up in their converſation, in which buſineſs
he owned he was very much employed, and one morning, when they were talking in
the counting-houſe upon this ſubject, the <hi>procureur</hi> ſaid, as he
was locking up his bureau, 
<q rend="inline">'here now is a pretty large fortune which has
been leſſened almoſt one-fourth by liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. It belonged to a nun, who
has been lately ſtolen from a neighbouring monaſtry—there it is
labelled and ſealed up, in notes upon the <hi>Caiſſe d'accompte, payable
au porteur—</hi>and I have now a ſupreme order, which I ſhall yield
to next week,—after I have made out my bill againſt it—to
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renderit to the Lady Abbeſs.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Naturally gueſſing that nuns were not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſtolen but that her he had heard of muſt be Madame Combrie, Figgins found
his point ſo far gained, and now the letter being arrived from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,
nothing remained but to receive their money.</p>
               <p>On the evening appointed for this buſineſs, the
<hi>procureur</hi> was invited by our travellers to a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
entertainment at the Hotel <hi>D'Angleterre.—</hi>Before ſupper the
ceremony of ſigning and ſealing <pb n="179" facs="tcp:1185300302:181"/> was performed, and
after ſupper all was hilarity. Figgins made the <hi>procureur</hi> harrangue,
Charles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on him to ſquall ſeveral <hi>chanſons a boire,</hi>
and Madame St. Vivier, who arrived at Nancy that very afternoon, took him out
to walk a minuet with her. In ſhort, the votary of chicane having made a good
bargain, a good ſupper, and fallen violently in love with Madame St. Vivier,
did not notice how the hours wore, and was at length, after a good finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
doſe, carried to bed, in a condition that laid him by the heels till ten
o'clock the next morning.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IT was three hours after Monſieur Goufre went home before he
diſcovered that any trick had been played him, for I hope the reader does not
ſuppoſe the ſupper was given for nothing. He aſked one of the clerks if
any body had called while he was engaged the evening before, and was anſwered
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body of any conſequence but Father Benedick.—
<q rend="inline">'What Father Benedick?' ſaid Goufre.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Him,' ſaid the clerk, 'we ſent to you at
the <hi>Hotel D'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleterre,</hi> and by whom you ſent your keys, with
written orders to deliver the fortune belonging to the convent of our lady of
the aſcenſion.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Written orders! Keys!' cried the aſtoniſhed
<hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureur.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'But it is impoſſible; here are my
keys.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well ſir, theſe are the keys he brought,'
ſaid the clerk, 'and here is the order: ſurely we know your hand
writing.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this Monſieur Goupe read, in a faultering 
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1185300302:183"/> accent, and in a hand ſo like his own that he could
himſelf find no difference: 
<q rend="inline">'Let Father Benedick have the packet in the
bureau labelled Money belonging to the convent of our lady of the
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>As all the French dance well, it is not wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that
Monſieur Goufre had ſcarcely read theſe words when he took a
<hi>chaſſee</hi> to the bureau, where he diſcovered the neſt without
the bird, <hi>caprioled</hi> back to the parlour for his hat and cane,
<hi>rigadooned</hi> to the door, <hi>briſeed</hi> out of it, and in a new
faſhioned <hi>pas courant</hi> preſently made an <hi>entre</hi> at the
houſe of the general of the police. There being joined by a proper number of
figurants, under the characters of <hi>ſergeants du ville, archets,</hi> and
<hi>pouſe culs,</hi> the <hi>procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reur</hi> paraded at their head to the
<hi>Hotel D'Angleterre,</hi> where, to enrich the proceſſion back again, he
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated our hero, Figgins, and Madame St. Vivier to perform a <hi>pas de
trois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In plain Engliſh, he fairly believed his pocked had been
picked while he was aſleep, and that our travellers, who were thieves, had
taken this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to rob him; and having imparted theſe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions to
the general of the police, he obtained an order to bring the delinquents before
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:1185300302:184"/> A few words however ſerved to convince
that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, and even the <hi>procureur</hi> himſelf, that his
ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions were groundleſs. The clerk depoſed that about ſeven
o'clock in the evening, a perſon in the garb of a friar, calling himſelf
Father Benedick, came to their houſe, and ſaid he had particular
bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with Monſieur Goufre, relative to a certain fortune belonging
to the convent of our lady of the aſcenſion. He repreſented that upon
various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences it had been ſo long kept out of the church's hands, that
it was in agitation to procure a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>procureur's</hi>
employments, if he ſhould refuſe immediately to deliver it. He ſaid it
was pity Monſieur Goufre was not within, for his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was ſo powerful
and deciſive, that if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned it would be with force, which he would
willingly avoid. The clerk ſaid, in conſequence of theſe menaces, he made
no ſcruple of ſending the ſuppoſed friar to his maſter, who, about a
quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before eight, returned with Monſieur Goufre's keys, and a written
order to deliver the fortune which was locked up in the bureau, and which had a
label ſimilar to that deſcribed in the ſaid written order. The clerk
ſwore he believed it to be the hand writing of his maſter, and he was
ſure the keys were thoſe his maſter then held in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:1185300302:185"/> Mr. Figgins here entreated that he might
have permiſſion to aſk the <hi>procureur</hi> a few queſtions, which
requeſt being complied with, he ſaid 
<q rend="inline">'Pray ſir in whoſe company were you from
half paſt ſix o'clock till nine, during which time this fraud is ſaid to
have been committed?'</q>
               </p>
               <p> Monſieur Goufre anſwered in his company.—
<q rend="inline">'Were you not,' ſaid Figgins, 'during that
whole time, in your ſober ſenſes?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Perfectly,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the man of law.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'And now let me rouſe your beſt recollection
while I aſk if in that very interval of time, you were not talking of your
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive buſineſs, of your property, and indeed of this very fortune
you now ſay you have loſt, but which you then bragged you had ſafely
locked up; as a proof of which you ſhewed us thoſe very keys, and at the
very time as it ſhould ſeem, that your clerk was uſing them—which
is a very likely ſtory—to deliver that fortune up to a perſon he had
never before ſeen.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The poor <hi>procureur</hi> felt this unanſwerable mode of
reaſoning moſt ſeverely, and the general of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice—whether
other caſes had induced him to doubt the veracity of Monſieur Goufre, or
whether he was conſcious that Engliſhmen are conſtantly upon theſe
occaſions not thoſe who dupe, but thoſe who <pb n="184" facs="tcp:1185300302:186"/> are
duped—ſeemed to pay great attention to Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins's harrangue, who
ſeeing his advantage, thought he could not do better than follow it up: which
he did in theſe words.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Upon the whole, it appears to me, and ſo it
ſhall to the Engliſh embaſſador, that Monſieur Goufre having found in
us a pretty free-milch cow, as to ſome money tranſactions we have had
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, has fancied, notwithſtanding the documents we have produced, that
we could not make good our pretenſions to rank and independency, and
therefore imagined we might be awed, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of a ſham robbery,
into a compoſition: and this appears from many circumſtances.—What
had we to do with this fortune? Why were we to know in what place it lay? Why
have we been repeatedly ſhewn the key that locked it up? Beſides, the
matter has been ſo bunglingly managed, that the clerk depoſes that very key
was ſent at the individual time he himſelf confeſſes to have had it in
his pocket. Then he does not pretend to ſay that the hand writing is not like
his, but, on the contrary, ſo like that he ſhould have taken it for his
own. But it was neceſſary this ſhould be ſaid, becauſe if the hand
writing had not been exactly like his, the clerk would have had no pretence
whatever to have delivered the <pb n="185" facs="tcp:1185300302:187"/> fortune. Again, what was
this ſame Father Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedick?—and how had he got all this intelligence?
How inſinuated himſelf into his pocket inviſibly, and conveyed away the
keys, during an interval of perhaps the only five minutes in an hour and a half
that they had been truſted there without his hand upon them for their
ſecurity; but, at any rate, to make the ſtory in the ſmalleſt degree
colourable, what connection had this ſuppoſed Father Benedick with them, to
lend the ſmalleſt probability to their being concerned in a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
ſo very derogatory to their honour as gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, ſo totally
unneceſſary to their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which Monſieur Goufre had taken
care, with the moſt ſcrupulous exactneſs, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maſter
of—and ſo diſgraceful to the name of Engliſhmen? How had it been
proved that they, ſo far from knowing the friar in queſtion, had a ſingle
aſſociate, even of their own country?—for both the clerks gave very
clear teſtimony that Father Benedick ſpoke with an accent ſo pure and
vernacular, that they were ſure he was a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and indeed ſo he was.
All theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſidered, it was impoſſible this affair
ſhould be otherwiſe than a groſs attempt—an event which occurred
too frequently—to impoſe upon Engliſh credulity; which, however
others <pb n="186" facs="tcp:1185300302:188"/> might paſs over, would not, in the preſent
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, be regarded in any light either trifling or pardonable; on the
contrary, it would be found that men of character had been tampered with, who
were both able and willing to right themſelves. He therefore inſiſted,
for the ſake of general juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and the honour of the Engliſh nation,
that the matter ſhould be fully and publicly inveſtigated: to which and
they would be content to ſubmit to a temporary impriſonment, provided
Monſieur Goufre ſhould be laid under the ſame reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The general of the police, whou could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſee that
all this intelligence had been, by the moſt ſubtle train of artful
inſinuation, deliberately drawn from Goufre, by Figgins, with a view to
forward the deſigns of Combrie—who the reader ſees was father
Benedick—had no manner of doubt but that every word he had heard was
truth.</p>
               <p>His own private opinion indeed was, that being in a ſhort time
to deliver up the fortune, the <hi>procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reur</hi> had conjured up the whole
accuſation to cover his embezzlement of the money. As to the friar, he had
not the leaſt doubt but that he was a real character, procured probably by
his relation, the ſuperior of the Chartreux, who, as we have ſaid 
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1185300302:189"/> was occaſionally concerned with Mr. Goufre in his law
practices.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, he ſo well knew, as he thought, the trim of the
buſineſs, that he would not have heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to comply with the terms of
Mr. Figgins, had he not had ſome very material objections to get rid of.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, he well knew that their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of each
others illicit conduct was mutual; they had trod together the paths of
oppreſſion; and it was their conſtant cuſtom when either was likely to
get into a ſcrape, to call the other to his aſſiſtance. In the
preſent caſe, however, the <hi>procureur</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly ſworn to
the general of the police that he had actually been robbed, and this was indeed
the truth; but matters—thanks to Figgins's addreſs—wore now ſo
different an aſpect, that this ſeeming want of confidence quite
exaſperated him, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his own actual ſafety made him heſitate
a moment to take part againſt the <hi>procureur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Balancing thus between his conviction and his intereſt, he
thought proper to purſue a middle courſe. He ſaid, as there had actually
been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proved which had been alledged, he could not anſwer ſending
to priſon three perſons, one of <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1185300302:190"/> them a lady, who had
made ſo handſome a defence. Monſieur Goufre had certainly, in the firſt
tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of his reſentment, done what he thought very juſtifiable, but
what, upon reflection, had neither certainty, nor even probability, to
ſupport it; that it was plain he had been ſome way or other tricked, how
would very likely hereafter appear; and, if he had been too warm, ſtung as he
was at being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of a large depoſite, which it would cut deep into his
fortune to make good, thoſe very traits of liberality on which that
gentleman—meaning Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins—had dwelt, would, he hoped, induce him
and his friend to overlook ſurely a very pardonable error.</p>
               <p>Charles ſaid, Monſieur Goufre's mad manner of rectifying a
miſtake, he thought, deſerved no lenity at their hands. For his part he
ſhould deteſt the idea of patching up a matter that ſtruck ſo hard in
him at the honour of every young nobleman on his travels. He ſhould think, if
he paſſed by ſuch a glaring impertinence, every one of his Engliſh
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance ought to reſent it. He ſhould therefore acquaint the
Engliſh embaſſador, who was his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's particular friend, of the whole
buſineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſmalleſt reſerve; and if he muſt endure to
have a hated liberty forced upon him, he would at leaſt, let his
inconvenience be what it might, ſtay <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1185300302:191"/> in that town till
not only himſelf and his friend ſhould be handſomely cleared, but till he
who had the audacity to ſcandalize their characters ſhould meet with his
merited puniſhment. So ſaying, he gave the lady his hand, and ſaid if
their forms would admit it he ſhould chuſe to go from that place, but that
he ſhould be found at the <hi>Hotel D'Angleterre</hi> till the matter was
finally decided.</p>
               <p>They were followed out by the general of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, who
whiſpered Figgins, in the hall, that he plainly ſaw Monſieur Goufre had
done a raſh thing, but that it need not hinder them from purſuing their
tour, for if they would leave twenty guineas in his hands, he would take care
as much juſtice ſhould be done to their honour as if they were
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>In this I verily believe he ſpoke truth, but Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins cut him
ſhort with this reply:</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Sir, If the law has any power over us, uſe it
now you have us in your cuſtody; if not, the beſt of you ſhall have
reaſon to repent this outrage: and as to leaving twenty guineas in your
hands, I would do it with great pleaſure, were I not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily bound by a
vow not to truſt any French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man further than I can ſee him.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:1185300302:192"/> The general of the police ſaid it was a
great pity ſo good an opportunity ſhould be loſt, and added that perhaps
the young gentleman was not bound by the vow.</p>
               <p>Charles ſaid he was always bound by the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of his
governor, eſpecially when they went to a prevention of his being duped.</p>
               <p>The general of the police not thinking fit to urge the matter
any farther, after many reverences, retired to the <hi>procureur;</hi> after
which our travellers departed, firſt giving the officers of juſtice
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to drink.</p>
               <p>Monſieur Goufre was found by his friend in a ſtate of
diſtraction. The latter however believed it all put on, and began very
ſeverely to upbraid him with his duplicity, and to blame him for having made
ſuch a fool of himſelf.</p>
               <p>The <hi>procureur</hi> ſwore that he had been robbed, and was
ruined, and confirmed the oath with a hundred others. He was unfortunate enough
however to gain no manner of credit; on the contrary, the general of the police
told him, in ſo many words, that ſince he was above placing confidence in
his <pb n="191" facs="tcp:1185300302:193"/> friends, he ſincerely wiſhed the Engliſhmen
might trounce him.</p>
               <p>This introduced a warm bout at alternate recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, till at
length both became cool, and they determined, in conjunction with the
ſuperior of the Chartreux, to take an early opportunity of delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating on
the moſt expedient means to get out of ſuch a diſagreeable ſcrape.</p>

                  <p>AN EXPLANATORY LETTER—A LITTLE VEXATION—AND A
JOURNEY TO LYONS.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MADAME St. Vivier had not the ſmalleſt idea that her
companions really knew any thing of the fraud. She had acted her part to
perfection the night before, as to making Monſieur Goufre drunk and
ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but was ignorant that the trick went any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than getting
good terms from him as to the money that was borrowed; neither had a ſyllable
of the ſituation of Madame Combrie been explained to her; for it is natural
to ſuppoſe our travellers did not ſo ſin againſt good breeding as to
introduce ſuch a character into that lady's company. She might be ſent
purpoſely to Dover, and probably was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be played off as a
<hi>corps de reſerve</hi> upon our hero, but when no direct outrage on
propriety was neceſſary, Mr. Figgins was too great a general to call in
aſſiſtance, when every thing went on even beyond his wiſhes. But how
beyond his wiſhes? Patience, dear reader: I would not have you know 
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1185300302:195"/> what is brewing, juſt at preſent, for any
conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Attend then, and let the fruit of your curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ripen by
degrees; nor—that it may have the better reliſh—wiſh to gather
it till it ſhall be ready to drop into your hand.</p>
               <p>Four or five days after the affair of the general of the police,
the <hi>procureur</hi> waited on our travellers, with great deference and
reſpect, and informed them that he had received a letter which had
ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him in every point relative to the fraud. He therefore acquitted
them ſo heartily of any concern in that matter, that he appeared extremely
ſhocked at his conduct, and ſaid he would publiſh their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
coupled with any acknowledgment of his own, by way of conceſſion, that they
ſhould think proper to dictate. As to himſelf, he had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to
inform them that as it was now known he had not been to blame, at the mediation
of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the ſuperior of the Chartreux, and his friend the general of
the police, the chapter of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent to which the money was due had remitted
the payment of it till his death, provided he would then add the intereſt of
it, and an additional be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of ten thouſand crowns.</p>
               <p>The letter to Monſieur Goufre was as follows:—
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1185300302:196"/> 
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>TO MONSIEUR GOUFRE.</head>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p> Leſt your clerks, or any other innocent perſons,
ſhould ſuffer under the ſuſpicion of having taken from your bureau that
fortune which in juſtice and equity is mine, in right of my wife, I write
this to acquaint you that, on Friday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laſt, about ſeven o'clock, I
called at your houſe, habited like a friar, and, under the name of Father
Benedick, demanded the fortune in your hands belonging to the convent of our
lady of the aſcenſion; intimating that if I did not ſee you, be where you
might, I ſhould return pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to compel you to reſign it. Your clerks
referred me to you at the <hi>Hotel D'Angleterre,</hi> from whence I feigned to
return at about a quarter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eight, bringing with me a written order, as
if from you—a duplicate of which I have encloſed, to ſhew you how
well I counterfeited your hand writing—and a bunch of keys, one of which
opened your bureau. One of your clerks, ſo completely impoſed upon,
naturally gave me what I wanted. I immediately departed, derobed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of
my holy accoutrements, mounted my horſe, and rode through bye-ways till I
arrived at Rouen <pb n="195" facs="tcp:1185300302:197"/>—firſt taking care to touch the
<hi>'Argent Comptant,</hi> which, as you know, I was eaſily enable to do, as
the whole fortune was in notes on the <hi>Caiſſe d'ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte</hi> at Paris,
payable <hi>au porteur—</hi>from whence, when I ſhall have put this
letter in the poſt, a veſſel will carry me to Guernſey, and, before it
can reach you, I ſhall be in England.</p>
                        <p> It may not be amiſs to tell you that the key which opened
your bureau I cauſed to be made from your own, for which purpoſe I took
care to be very much about you, before I ſtole my dear Araminta from her
hypocritical directreſs. I knew it always accompanied four others, the ſize
of which did not eſcape my notice: two of them open cheſts, one a ſmall
cabinet, and the leaſt a caſket.</p>
                        <p> All theſe matters lent ſuch ſtrong probability to my
ſtory, with which my holy garb ſo well agreed—a garb which was never
uſed to a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier purpoſe—that it was impoſſible for me not to
ſucceed.</p>
                        <p> If this confeſſion will do you any good with the

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1185300302:198"/> that ſerves to maintain an honeſt pair, whoſe

that money is their right—is more worthily, nay more religiouſly

ſlothful drones who, as you and I know, ſhut themſelves up from the world
not to cheriſh holineſs, but to hide profligacy.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This letter, which ſpeaks ſo plain, completes the account of
Figgins's ſcheme, which I have thus piece-meal explained to the reader. The
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the keys, which was a fact, together with the knack which
Combrie had of imitating Goufre's hand writing,—which indeed is not
difficult, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Frenchmen write alike—gave a hint of it, and
the idea of an application to the ſuperior of the Chartreux, and all thoſe
concurrent circumſtances which we have ſeen ſo well managed, could not
fail to crown it with ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>This hiſtory then has ſo far acted in its cuſtomary
province as to make one couple happy already. How long they are to continue
ſo, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible <pb n="197" facs="tcp:1185300302:199"/> but we may hereafter
have occaſion to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>It will eaſily be ſeen that this affair ended greatly to the
honour of our travellers, who, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, attracted the notice of all
the Engliſh who then reſided at Nancy. Among the reſt they were viſited
by a gentleman, whoſe company, as a plain ſtraight-forward, well-meaning
man, was very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to them. He ſerved admirably well to make one at a
party of whiſt, and for a curſory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance really was not without his
merit.</p>
               <p>A very ſhort time however let them into the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of this
new acquaintance, whoſe name was Ireland; for one night, being at whiſt,
with Mr. Figgins for his partner, Charles was ſo tantalized into betting, and
confuſed off his guard, that he got up from the table an hundred and fifty
pounds loſer, in ſpight of all the hints and expoſtulations of Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
who only played for crowns.</p>
               <p>The next day he heard, from undoubted autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that Mr.
Ireland was an errant ſharper, and had eſcaped from England after killing a
gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a duel, who had dared to tax him publicly with a palpable
fraud.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:1185300302:200"/> This loſs however had one good effect
upon our hero, for he made a moſt ſolemn vow never again to loſe five
pounds at one ſitting, which reſolution he inviolably kept to the day of
his death.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid very little of Charles's continual
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, at not receiving letters from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or indeed any
body elſe, ſince his departure from England. The truth is that it gave him
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible concern, and occaſioned from him many and various
remonſtrances, which were apparently very little heeded.</p>
               <p>Figgins teſtified as much uneaſineſs as our hero, but upon
this, as well as every other ſubject, he comforted him by a variety of
arguments. He ſaid it very often occurred that people on a tour miſſed of
their letters, though at length they came ſafely to hand; that at Nancy, for
example, it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three weeks before a man could write a letter and
receive an anſwer to it; and this inconvenience would encreaſe in
proportion as they went farther. There was no doubt, he ſaid, but every thing
would fall upon its legs, and the letters would all come together in a lump,
and he cheerfully agreed to wait at Lyons till every proper explanation could
be mutually exchanged, not only as to Charles and his father, but every other
correſpondent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:1185300302:201"/> This kind accommodation in Figgins gave
our hero great pleaſure. He had really, at times, felt very unpleaſantly on
this ſubject, and though he could account for his diſappointment at
Liſle, yet more than two months had elapſed ſince that time, during which
interval he had repeatedly written in ſuch a full and ſatisfactory manner,
that he could not bear to reflect on the parting between him and his father,
and, at the ſame time, hold in mind that all his attempts to learn the
ſtate of that ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able parent's mind were continually baffled. He knew not
what might have happened in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: he had dreaded to leave him: nay he
would not think on the ſubject, it was dreadful to him! yet he could not give
a reaſon for it. Who knew but the letters received at Liſle, ſince he had
heard nothing afterwards, might give an account of an unfavourable alteration
in his father's health: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they contained a tender injunction to come and
cloſe the dying eyes of an indulgent parent: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he was then dead, and
the letters were from friends who gave him the melancholy news, which his
perfidious brother had received with a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant and cruel joy.</p>
               <p>Reflections like theſe greatly embittered the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of
our hero, and though I have not thought it neceſſary to preſent the
reader with any <pb n="200" facs="tcp:1185300302:202"/> thing but the agreeable ſide of the
picture, yet it is certainly true that Charles had his moments when he felt
very ſevere and bitter unhappineſs; nay he had once very nearly determined
to return to Calais, the better to inveſtigate this unpleaſant
buſineſs, though the natural gaiety, and I will ſay honeſty, of his
diſpoſition, prevented his particular griefs from interfering with
pleaſures in which others were concerned. What wonder then if the kind
conſoling advice of Figgins kept his mind in that tranquillity which made it
impoſſible for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned perſon to penetrate his chagrin.</p>
               <p>I have conceived it neceſſary to ſay thus much, leſt the
reader ſhould think our hero had, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome other heroes, left
his feeling in his own country, and that his foreign freaks—every one of
which I undertake to contend had a defenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motive—were merely the
common effect of that faſhionable conceit and ſupercilious levity which are
the qualities the French have, in general, a right to take as a ſample of
Engliſh manners.</p>
               <p>All affairs at Nancy being properly ſettled, Charles began to
be very impatient for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to Lyons. Before they ſet out,
however, he drew up a recapitulation of all his other letters, to which he
added many earneſt entreaties; and, <pb n="201" facs="tcp:1185300302:203"/> that it might be
ſure to go ſafe, entruſted it to the care of Figgins himſelf, who
inſiſted upon putting it in the poſt office, ſwearing he began to
ſuſpect every body; and, when he returned, ſaid that Maſter John
ſhould not be ſo confidently truſted for the future. 
<q rend="inline">'Why ſo?' ſaid Charles.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Nay no great matter,' anſwered Figgins.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I begin to have my ſuſpicions of him: but
perhaps theſe devils of women have corrupted him.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Charles aſked his friend what induced his ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions.
Figgins ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'I caught the raſcal in a lie, that is all:
which I cannot bear. Dam'me if there is ſo pimping a thing upon earth as an
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary lie.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'From a perſon in whom you place confidence,'
ſaid Charles, 'there cannot be a crime of ſuch magnitude. As death is
better than torture, ſo open enmity is better than hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den deceit. Even a
trifling lie, in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, may conceal the moſt tremendous
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. For my part, I look upon plain inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity to be ſo
poſitively eſſential in the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a friend, that though I
were one maſs of imperfections, I would forgive the continual rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of
them, both to myſelf and the world, rather than they ſhould be
hyperbolically gloſſed over. On the contrary, if I thought the man I 
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1185300302:204"/> truſted could even meditate a wiſh to deceive me,
let my partiality be what it might, I would tear him from my heart, even though
it ſhould burſt in making the effort.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Figgins, who had eyed our hero with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary tokens of
amazement, while he animatedly pronounced theſe words, firſt looked pale,
then red, but recovered however in time to put in for his ſhare of this
honeſt opinion; and, after an eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium on Charles's way of thinking, and
reflecting on John, who alone he choſe to underſtand as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon all
this warmth was levelled at, he finiſhed his remark with 
<q rend="inline">'Damn the fellow, I ſhould be ſorry to find
him a raſcal, for I have a regard for him.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Charles certainly had no particular meaning in the words he had
uttered, but his diſappointment at not hearing from his father gave him
occaſionally a kind of peeviſh diſcontent, as if he found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body had
deceived him, though he knew not who. As a proof that he had not the
ſmalleſt miſtruſt of Figgins, he entruſted him, as we have juſt
ſeen, with his letter to put in the poſt office; yet he was ſcarcely gone
but he wiſhed he had taken it himſelf: though he ſincerely believed this
wiſh a tacit, though an involuntary, injuſtice to his friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:1185300302:205"/> The contents of his letter next were gone
over in his mind, in which he found nothing but a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of
diſappointments, that, for ought he knew, would be rewarded with new ones;
eſpecially as he was confident, in his own mind, they originated in ſome
ſecret cauſe which he had not been, nor ſhould ever be perhaps, able to
penetrate. In this trim of thinking, when Figgins returned and dropt thoſe
hints concerning John, out came the very ſoul of our hero, and ſo it would
have done had his own ruin been the conſequence.</p>
               <p>Figgins—for what reaſon perhaps the reader may
conceive—verily believed this thruſt was at him, and though he not only
ſaw he had well parried it, but, as he firmly believed, diſarmed his young
friend of all ſuſpicion, yet he feared, that ſhould he take in his head
to arm himſelf frequently with theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient doubts, as he did not want
for ſkill in theſe ſort of conflicts, he, Figgins, might one day or other
receive ſuch a hit as might prove a mortal ſtab to all his hopes of
bringing thoſe ſchemes to bear which he certainly, for ſome reaſon or
other, was concerting; for though I have conſtantly allowed that Charles was
credulous, he could not be groſsly impoſed upon; and no man knew this
better than Figgins, who, with all his management, would not have been able
eaſily to gain his ends, which <pb n="204" facs="tcp:1185300302:206"/> were now—though
the reader, as I have ſaid, muſt wait with patience to know
how—nearly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, had not a ſeries of unexpected events
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to give him a helping hand.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>FULL OF INTERESTING MATTER—AND, AMONG THE REST, TWO
DEATHS.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>OUR travellers arrived at Lyons after a ſafe and pleaſant
journey. They viſited every thing curious, were frequently at the play, made
acquaintance with men of condition and taſte, and, in ſhort, here, as in
other places, availed themſelves of every opportunity of improvement: thus
fulfilling the real purpoſes of travelling.</p>
               <p>Theſe matters however I have even leſs time to particularize
here than I had heretofore, and therefore ſhall leave to the readers
imagination what was the employment of a young man and his governor who were
really ambitious of returning home with as much knowledge as they could pick
up, but which acquiſition Charles in particular—as the reader ſhall
hear—became poſſeſſed of more than he wiſhed.</p>
               <p>Our hero, walking one day in a field beyond the ramparts, was
meditating on a ſmall book, in the <pb n="206" facs="tcp:1185300302:208"/> midſt of a grove,
when he heard behind him a ruſtling. Directing his eyes to the place from
whence the noiſe iſſued, he ſaw two men very warmly attacking each
other with drawn ſwords. In the impetuoſity of his firſt ſenſations,
he bounded like a fawn to the place, and drawing to part the combatants, one of
them, like Mercutio, was hurt under our hero's arm. He faultered out 
<q rend="inline">'<hi>Oh Jeſu Je ſuis mort!</hi>'</q> and
fell down.</p>
               <p>Charles was ſo dreadfully ſhocked at this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that he
thought of nothing but endeavouring to ſuccour the wounded perſon, on which
chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table employ he was ſo intent, that he did not pay the ſmalleſt
regard to the other, who, upon ſeeing his antagoniſt drop, fled with the
fwifteſt precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>A moment's recollection convinced our hero that he was in a
moſt ſingularly perilous ſituation. The poor wounded wretch ſeemed to
be dying, and every circumſtance would ſerve to make it believed that he
was the murderer. Nevertheleſs, his ſtrong humanity ſo prevailed over his
prudence, that he ran without the wood, and holloed to the centinel upon the
ramparts for help, telling him there was a man dangerouſly wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:1185300302:209"/> Several gentlemen who were walking on the
ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts preſently came up, to whom Charles related, but not without much
confuſion—for he was moſt exceedingly affected—the whole matter
as it had paſſed. Unfortunately his relation gained very little credit.
They all knew the nature of duelling, and naturally imagined a prudent perſon
would, upon ſuch an occaſion, go another way rather than interfere with two
men who were agreed upon fairly deciding a quarrel by the law of arms.</p>
               <p>Charles was aſtoniſhed when he underſtood their
ſuſpicions, and could not help aſking, with ſome diſdain, whether the
French always requited the good offices of ſtrangers in the ſame manner.
One or two of the gentlemen took heat at this, and ſaid he ſhould anſwer
every thing at large before the general of the police.</p>
               <p>Charles treated their menaces with perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
relying upon the teſtimony of the dying man, who however left his protector
in the lurch; for after an ineffectual attempt to ſpeak, he pointed to
Charles, and falling backward, expired.</p>
               <p>This action was univerſally allowed to have been intended as a
ſign to diſtinguiſh the murderer, and what ſtrongly corroborated the
general opinion was <pb n="208" facs="tcp:1185300302:210"/> our hero's ſword, which was very
much ſtained with blood. It was in vain that he accounted very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally for
this circumſtance, by ſaying that when he firſt ſaw the dead man fall,
he abandoned his ſword, the better to lend him aſſiſtance, and that of
courſe, as it lay, the blood, which ran in a ſtream, had fallen upon
it.</p>
               <p>This was conſtrued into cunning and art. In ſhort, the guard
arrived, and he was conducted to the houſe of the general of the police,
comforted however with 
<q rend="inline">'<hi>Courage! on pardon en France un coup de
vivacite.</hi>'</q> In ſpight however of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable tidings,
Figgins, who had been waiting for our hero to breakfaſt at their inn, was
very ſoon ſummoned to breakfaſt with him in priſon.</p>
               <p>Figgins inſiſted upon it, in the ſtrongeſt terms, that
it was impoſſible his friend could be concerned in this buſineſs
otherwiſe than as an accidental me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. The gentleman who had fallen was a
man of ſome conſideration, reſident in that place, where Charles was an
abſolute ſtranger, and had not the ſmalleſt acquaintance. He offered to
ſwear that, till this unhappy morning, he had never been a ſingle ten
minutes out of his company ſince his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in Lyons, and how could ſo
ſerious a quarrel have engendered without previous malice?—with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out 
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1185300302:211"/> the ſmalleſt acquaintance with the unfortunate
perſon, or even knowledge that any ſuch man had exiſtence? He maintained
there was not upon earth a leſs turbulent ſpirit than his friend; that his
diſpoſition was the ſweeteſt, mildeſt, moſt benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in the
world; that there could not be in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a more benevolent heart. He would
anſwer with his life that, was the fact as they ſuſpected, his young
friend had not the ſoul to be guilty of ſuch low, ſuch treacherous
baſeneſs as to diſown it. On the contrary, as no laws were ſo lenient,
as to accidental rencounters, as thoſe of France, ſo far from denying what
had happened, he would feel enough at having been the deſtruction of a fellow
creature, however unintentionally, without adding guilt to misfortune, by
excuſing himſelf at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a wilful lie.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe arguments, Figgins inſiſted that they had
not conſulted even common probability in this buſineſs. His friend had
averred that the murderer fled. Who was he then? No people were ſo remarkably
provident as to who went and came as the French. Let the book of the general of
the police be conſulted, and ſee who had retired from the town. If he was a
ſettler, it would eaſily be known; if a ſtranger, intelligence of him
might be gathered at the place where he lodged. As to the <pb n="210" facs="tcp:1185300302:212"/> action of the dying man, he was aſſured it had been intended to
point out his friend as one who had endeavoured to preſerve him. In ſhort,
he ſaid let the matter but have time, and be maturely inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and he
would reſign himſelf as an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, and willingly await the ſame
fate: ſtaking his own life upon the iſſue of his friend's inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
               <p>This manly and noble ſpeech, which was made in preſence of
ſome of the moſt conſiderable people of Lyons, had its effect. It was
warmly agreed, even by the relations of the deceaſed—who, by the bye,
got a fortune by his death—that every thing ought to be well
conſidered. Accordingly, the term of ſix weeks was fixed to make all the
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary enquiries, at which time it was intended, if nothing happened to
exculpate our hero, that he ſhould be brought to trial.</p>
               <p>It was now the buſineſs of Figgins to alleviate, as much as
poſſible, the diſtreſſes of his friend.—he had however very
little comfort for him. It had been found that a ſtranger had actually
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded on the very morning this ſad affair hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, but as the inland
towns in France are not ſo particular as to mere ſtrangers as the
ſea-ports, he could not learn his name. He aſked Charles if he 
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1185300302:213"/> had no idea who the murderer was. Charles ſaid he had
ſcarcely given him a ſingle look, ſo inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly was the
miſchief done; and that from that moment he had not ſeen him at all, his
whole care having been directed towards the dying man: but, notwithſtanding
all theſe diſadvantages, he was ſure he had ſomewhere ſeen him,
though it was then utterly out of his power to recollect when or where.</p>
               <p>In a few days after the impriſonment of our hero, Figgins came
to him and ſaid he was greatly afraid there was ſome damned plot in the
buſineſs, for that the women were gone off, and had taken John with
them.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'What plot can there be?' ſaid Charles.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'In this ſituation they are tired of us, and
reſolved to ſhift for themſelves: a very common reſolution for
creatures of their ſtamp.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'True,' ſaid Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, 'but how will you
reconcile the conduct of Mr. John? I will tell you what has lately ſtruck
me.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'What?' ſaid Charles.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why,' anſwered Figgins, 'that this ſame
Madame St. Vivier is known to Mrs. O'Shockneſy, and, if ſo, there is no
miſchief, however deteſtable, but you may apprehend. That woman has the
hypocriſy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:1185300302:214"/> of the devil. She delights in miſchief; it ſeems to
be as requiſite to her exiſtence as food; there is not ſuch an infernal
ſuccubus in human nature; and may I be damned'—for our friend Figgins
would ſometimes ſwear—'if it were my fate to chuſe whether to
encounter the anger of a hungry lion, or groan under the influence of a plot
againſt me, prepared and inflicted by that ſhe fiend, if I would not
truſt the claws of old Leo rather than the diabolical fangs of Mother
O'Shockneſy.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Now you may remember,' continued Figgins, 'I
caught Maſter John in a lie. It was this:—Kitty had told me ſhe had
ſeen this gentleman of ours very buſily employed in a familiar
converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Liſle with that fellow of your brother's, Fluſh, whom,
by the way, I never liked—indeed I know Mr. Standfaſt turned him off on
account of his attachment to Mrs. O'Devil. Why Mrs. Kitty told me this I
remember I thought very odd at the time, but catching from it, at the moment,
an idea concerning the embezzlement of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I, with more bluntneſs
than wit, taxed the gentleman with his intimate acquaintance with Mr. Fluſh,
which he denied, and which Kitty confirmed to his face. It was this determined
me to take your letters myſelf, and this has kept me ever ſince upon my
guard, as to this fellow; <pb n="213" facs="tcp:1185300302:215"/> and finding now which way he
inclines, it is more than poſſible he has been a raſcal all along, and
that even the half-guinea he refuſed from Sir Daniel Dogbolt was a feint,
through which he acted according to his inſtructions.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Charles ſaid he had never correctly underſtood that
buſineſs, or what it alluded to; nor had he known more than that ſome
difference had happened between his father and mother, which had been happily
adjuſted through the mediation of Mr. Standfaſt.</p>
               <p>Figgins ſaid when his mind could bear the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he would
acquaint him with all the particulars, exactly as it had been related by my
lord to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, at the John of Gaunt's Head, and who he ſaid had,
ſpight of all Standfaſt's care, not preſerved the ſecret ſo
ſacredly as a man of his profeſſion ought. This however did not happen to
be the truth, for it was through Mr. Standfaſt, and no other perſon, that
Mr. Figgins came by his intelligence. 
<q rend="inline">'But,' ſaid Figgins, 'to finiſh with this
dear harmleſs lady, whom I ſo dearly love, if ſhe has any hand in your
affairs, you may be aſſured it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of miſchief to you
both in England and here.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:1185300302:216"/> Charles ſaid he had no doubt of the
gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's kind offices, but yet he ſaw no harm that could come of them,
for his father was pretty well upon his guard againſt her; and as to his own
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, it was, he flattered himſelf, at leaſt in mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial points, not
ſuch as to merit reproach. 
<q rend="inline">'All I wiſh,' ſaid he, 'is to hear from my
dear father; if he remain ſafe from the malice of our enemies, I will forgive
every thing they can do to me.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſubject however was never out of Figgins's mouth, and
indeed, though nothing could be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with more cautious delicacy, one would
think he had an inclination to ſink his friends ſpirits till he ſhould be
inclined to ſave the trouble of a public trial, by hanging himſelf in his
priſon.</p>
               <p>All this however was not ſufficient to damp the ſpirits of
our hero, though I muſt own his ſituation ſeemed a good deal to tire his
patience. He had ſo invariably adhered to thoſe principles which, at his
outſet in life, he had ſo invariably laid down for himſelf, that,
conſcious of his own innocent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, he did not believe it poſſible
that he could ſink under the weight of injuſtice. He therefore entreated
his friend—who, as the trial approached, put on looks more and more
rueful—to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf eaſy. 
<q rend="inline">'How can I?' ſaid Figgins. 'All the 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1185300302:217"/> devils in hell, one would think, conſpire againſt
you. I declare to God to ſee virtue like yours ſo oppreſſed is enough
to make one curſe one's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wiſh rather to be the vileſt reptile
than a human creature.'</q> And then would he enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate the damned things, as
he called them, that had fallen out to thwart the good intentions of our hero;
and theſe would he follow up with his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions for his ſafety; then
cut a little out of the way to take a wipe at that fury in petticoats, Mrs.
O'Shockneſy; then curſe, then hope, then ſhudder, then admire again the
fortitude of his friend, and then exclaim that in ſuch an infernal world as
this, it was not worth while to be virtuous, for that none but raſcals were
happy.</p>
               <p>It was about two days before the trial, when he had one morning
wound up, or rather let down, our hero, by ſimilar remarks to theſe, that
he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to go through the whole buſineſs of Miſs Snaffle, with all
its conſequences, which really ſhocked Charles to ſuch a degree that his
ſpirits were ſcarcely able to bear it. Seeing this, Figgins curſed
himſelf for his inconſiderate raſhneſs. Said he, 
<q rend="inline">'My unconquerable friendſhip makes me a fool;
and, in proportion as you are oppreſſed, you ſo creep into my heart,
that, out of complaiſance to your curioſity, I do the very things which
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <pb n="216" facs="tcp:1185300302:218"/> you, when—if like other men I had more art
than honeſty—I ſhould try to render you cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to your fate, rather
than melt you into almoſt a deſire to meet it. But come Charles,' added he,
embracing him, 'I will ſtand by you nobly, and if you muſt fall, you
ſhall not want a friend to revenge you.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this delightful mood did this kind friend per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Charles to
remain for that day. On the next he entered his friend's apartment with a
moſt cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful countenance, ſaying there was long-looked-for come at
laſt, and with theſe words preſented a packet of letters, which he ſaid
were juſt arrived by the poſt; but that was not all, another parcel had
been left at their bankers, which he ſuppoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the whole of his
father's letters, ever ſince he left England.</p>
               <p>Charles, who had haſtily catched at the firſt letter that
came to his hand, opened it, and found it from Sir Sidney. He wondered to ſee
it begin with Sir, but getting to the ſecond line, while Figgins was uttering
thoſe laſt words, which he did not hear, he exclaimed 
<q rend="inline">'Merciful God!'</q>—and fainted away.</p>
               <p>Aſſiſtance was ſummoned, and he recovered; when, having
raved himſelf almoſt into another <pb n="217" facs="tcp:1185300302:219"/> ſwoon, he became
ſtupid with horror. At length he grew more calm, and being entreated by his
friend to bear his fortunes like a man, he gathered compoſure enough to read
the following words.

like love than I have felt for any other; but I never could flatter myſelf we

convinced this prohibition—ſo perverſe is human nature—would

                        <head>TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ.</head>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p> I know not, in this hurry of my ſpirits, if there be any
precedents in books of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's writing to a man out of mere friendſhip; at
leaſt of ſufficient authenticity to warrant my diſregarding decorum in
this manner. If there are not, it is a new incident, and I muſt rely on the
purity of my intentions to excuſe it.</p>
                        <p> So extremely like a fairy tale, where the hero's bad genius
only makes its appearance, is all that has happened in this family relative to
you, that if I did not fancy I had myſelf ſagacity enough to account for
the influence of the foul fiend, and whence it originates, I ſhould think it
very hard indeed that people could not be contented with loſing their own
ſenſes, but they muſt inſiſt that others lay aſide theirs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="238" facs="tcp:1185300302:240"/> That I may haſten through this
epiſtle ſir—for I have a good deal to ſay—I am willing,
unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable as it may be at our houſe, to do you poetical juſtice; not
however in the ſtyle of your good friends here, who, finding you in danger of
your life, think—in imitation of ARISTOTLE, RICHARDSON, and the barber's
uncle in <hi>Gil Blas—</hi>that they cannot excite in you too much
ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
                        <p> This candour in me does not proceed from any weak
compaſſion, but from a fair reviſal of your actions at the time they
paſſed under my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and I do not think that charity
authoriſes me to look farther, at leaſt with a ſevere eye.</p>
                        <p> Abiding by this mode of deciſion, common juſtice
obliges me to ſay that all your mad freaks here, which I would not have given
a farthing for you if you had been without, originated from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy motives.
Muſquito, Ego, and even Too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good ſmarted, it is true, but they highly
merited their puniſhment, and the laſh was held by the hand of juſtice;
but think ye they forgot it in your abſence? Oh no: ſcurvy fellows as they
are. Thank heaven, however, the worſt of your enemies cannot give a bad
motive to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct <pb n="239" facs="tcp:1185300302:241"/> in a certain inſtance. Yet
there are ſome who compare you to Lovelace, and call your treatment of Jude 
<q rend="inline">"ſparing your
roſebud:"</q>—charming young man as you were, and I will believe
<hi>are.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p> Judy daily bleſſes you, poor girl, and joins with me to
pray for the hard hearts that are ſet againſt you. Your behaviour as to her
began, continued, and ended critically right, and her virtue, as it ought, was
rewarded in the cataſtrophe; nor can a ſoul capable of ſuch an act
indulge a ſingle prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that could dictate ſuch dreadful crimes as we
are all commanded to believe againſt you.</p>
                        <p> As for my part, I have read ſo much that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature is
a thing I am pretty well verſed in. I muſt beg leave therefore to uſe my
own proper intellects, rather than thoſe of others; for though I am devoted
to Sir Sidney, yet I am more ſo to truth and honour: and theſe wih not let
me ſee why nature ſhould perform a miracle, by turning all thoſe
excellent gifts ſhe had afforded you into diabolical ones, merely for the
gratification of your enemies, and commiting a breach of promiſe, which ſhe
was never known in any other inſtance to do.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="240" facs="tcp:1185300302:242"/> Your father was certainly greatly
ſhocked at not hearing from you; but if we do not admit all the reſt, why
ſhould we not charitably believe your letters have been intercepted. For my
part, I ſhould think, if you had committed all this wickedneſs, you would
the ſooner have written to him, if it had been only for the ſake of
colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. But poor man his behaviour was very ſtrange towards the
laſt; yet you will find he could not bear to curtail you in your
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                        <p> As to the ſtate of our family, it is briefly as follows:
Sir Sidney will not hear a word in your favour from any body; my dear lady you
know is the mirror of duty and goodneſs, and therefore if ſhe have any
ſentiments to your advantage ſhe dare not divulge them even to me; charming
Annette, who—or our complicated hiſtory will be incomplete—muſt
marry you at laſt, is grown an angel, and I ſcruple not to tell you will
never love any body but yourſelf: but, dear creature, devoted to her duty,
how will ſhe dare to look a ſtern father in the face, much leſs diſobey
him; and, unfortunately, ſhe is not Lady Roebuck's child.</p>
                        <p> I have not mentioned to you however all our 
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1185300302:243"/> family: Mr. Gloſs I can aſſure you is no very
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable member of it. He has ſo puſhed himſelf among the great,
that he is in parliament, and he has ſo attached himſelf to Sir Sidney,
that he is become his darling. He has certainly a knowledge of human nature,
but it is an artful one; for I can ſee plainly he has got round the good
gentleman by praiſing his anceſtry, which we all know is his foible. They
have agreed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on making ſome motion relative to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities of
Engliſh baronets: then he has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a number of improvements at
Caſtlewick, and put the people in a way of carrying the goods to market upon
much better terms than they were uſed to; which is all very good if his
motives were ſo: he has alſo been indefatigable in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding Sir
Sidney's deſigns at Little Hockley, but how that will be now I do not know,
for your brother is beginning to ſettle grooms and others of his ſporting
followers there.</p>
                        <p> Mr. Gloſs, finding my partiality to books, thought he
knew where to find me vulnerable; but all his erudition was not able to cover
his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which I could not however come into, for my ſtudies have
never been ſubtilty, but nature. As to my ſweet Miſs Annette, he was
there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely at a loſs, for ſhe has no foible.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="242" facs="tcp:1185300302:244"/> Thus you ſee you have no friend but
me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Mr. Figgins, who, if the current account is to be credited, is
almoſt—for nobody it ſeems can be quite—as bad as
yourſelf.</p>
                        <p> Fear not however but ſome good will work out of this. I
ſhall be upon my guard, and I am very much miſtaken if I do not know of
whom to be watchful. I only remark at preſent, that as it was ſaid of
ALEXANDER the beſt trait in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was the choice of his tutor, ſo I

it proves that her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects are remarkably ſtrong, for ſhe ſeems to

been very ſhrewd and ſenſible; but her diſlike to Standfaſt is of
ancient date. He made pretty briſk love to her when he was in the family of
Major Malplaquet, and, upon her reſiſting his <pb n="244" facs="tcp:1185300302:246"/>

                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:1185300302:249"/> If this fate really awaits him, the
reader and I may hereafter make ſome enquiry concerning his behaviour; for,
as we have already examined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his life and character, that ſame
behaviour and his laſt dying ſpeech ſeems all that is wanting to wind up
his ſtory. At preſent we are going into happier company, and if it be
objected againſt us that in ſo doing we are deſerters to his cauſe
under whoſe banner we have inliſted, we muſt even excuſe ourſelves by
ſaying that we are not the only friends who have left a hero in priſon, to
go over to his enemies.</p>

                  <p>A CLUE TO THE FOREGOING LABYRINTH.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>RETROSPECTION is a very good and a very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary thing. If
one's actions appear worthy upon a review, they will be a ſort of ſecurity
for the future; if otherwiſe, their deformity being an unpleaſant object of
contemplation, we may perhaps wiſh to replace it with ſomething of a more
lovely appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: at leaſt this will be the caſe with good minds. Some
men love ſingularity, others uglineſs, and I ſincerely believe it is in
ſome men's nature to love wickedneſs, and even wickedneſs in which no
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure can be enjoyed but the mere exerciſe of it. For my part, however,
I ſhall not here treat of ſuch innate, undeducible affections, but
endeavour to give to a poſitive cauſe every little freak of fancy that the
perſonages in this hiſtory chuſe to occupy their attention with.</p>
               <p>A very extraordinary conduct has been lately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to
govern all the good people on this ſide of the water, ever ſince the reader
and I took leave of <pb n="249" facs="tcp:1185300302:251"/> them, in order to accompany our hero
to France. What appears leaſt reconcileable to credibility, is the alteration
of Sir Sidney, who, being a man of reaſon, of the world, of experience, of
conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and of uncommon benevolence, one would naturally ſuppoſe
muſt, in a moſt extraordinary manner, have been tampered with before he
could have been induced to give up a young man in whoſe dawnings of maturity
he had taken abundant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, whoſe father he had loved and honoured,
and of whoſe happineſs he had hoped to have been the guardian.</p>
               <p>Indeed when our hero left England Sir Sidney contemplated with
great pleaſure when he ſhould return, in the bloom of manhood, with all
thoſe confirmed accompliſhments ſo conſonant to his rank and talents,
the reaſonable delight with which he ſhould witneſs an union between him
and his daughter, and as no one ſpoke of Charles but in a ſtyle of the
moſt exalted panegyric, no wonder if he was charmed at ſeeing every thing
and every body confirm ſuch honeſt and legitimate ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But, when
a week, then a fortnight, then a month, then two, then four, elapſed without
a ſingle line from Charles to either his father, his miſtreſs, or any
other friend, what could Sir Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <pb n="250" facs="tcp:1185300302:252"/> think? What
judgment could he form of thoſe reports which continually aſſailed his
ears, and which ſeemed gradually to turn all his friends againſt him?</p>
               <p>It may not be amiſs to watch the progreſs of this
buſineſs. Zekiel, as the reader was long ago in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, when he left Eaton
went to France. There being in very ſtraitened circumſtances, and totally
under the direction of Mr. Fluſh, he was obliged to practiſe many tricks
and ſhifts to get on, eſpecially as Kiddy, who ſeems as a
manooverer—his own word—to be a twin-born with Standfaſt, very
carefully threw certain gentlemen depredators in his way, who are, as every
body knows, pretty plentiful in France, and who took care—his own
language again—to keep the purſe, by ſweating it, in good running
order.</p>
               <p>Being very cloſely driven at Calais, and not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough of
Kiddy about him to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what the law calls theft, from that
which is ſo denominated by reaſon, he did that through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience for
which he <hi>might</hi> have been hanged, when, in fact, his mode of policy
ſhould have made him do only that for which he <hi>ought</hi> to have been
hanged.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:1185300302:253"/> Mr. Deſſein, however, who had his
policy too, as we have ſeen, did not chuſe to expoſe him, and, by the
advice of his principal, he took care after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, however he offended
againſt juſtice in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſenſe, not to ſin againſt law.</p>
               <p>From a variety of ſources which Fluſh contrived to get
opened for him, Mr. Zekiel, together with his own income and what he could
drain from his mother, and indeed from Mr. Standfaſt, contrived to cut a very
capital daſh at Paris. He ſet very large ſums <hi>chez les
compteſſes,</hi> and he betted larger upon the courſe of Fontainebleau.
In ſhort, in ſpight of all he could amaſs together, honeſtly or
diſhoneſtly, he would have found himſelf not only aground, but
ſurrounded with ſome very marked diſgrace, if he had not met with a
gentleman who was ſo kind as to adminiſter very largely to his wants; and
who, not contented with ſuch liberal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of kindneſs to a perfect
ſtranger, gave evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent tokens of ſatisfaction when the young lord in
expectation informed him he had a very tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for his
ſiſter.</p>
               <p>This gentleman, the reader ſees, was Mr. Tad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole. He had, it
ſeems, in company with the young lady we ſaw at Liſle, who was, to ſay
truth, not his ſiſter—which circumſtance indeed Mr. Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins's 
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1185300302:254"/> ſagacity taught us to ſuſpect
before—deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to make one bold puſh to render himſelf
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant. He had amaſſed at the gaming table in England about nine
hundred pounds, to which his reputed ſiſter added thirteen hundred, which
ſhe had won at a different game. Their plan was to ſnap up ſome young man
of good expectations, firſt ſupplying him with money, and afterwards with a
wife.</p>
               <p>Tadpole, who was originally a lawyer's clerk, carefully
ſecured every ſtep he took, and, by the time he reached England, had Zekiel
ſo completely in his power, that, being then of age, he ſcrupled not to
make over to his friend the reverſion of a part of his father's terra
firma.</p>
               <p>Coming ſo unexpectedly to his title and fortune, advantage was
taken of this power over him, and a marriage ſuddenly clapt up; not out of
fear of any reluctance in the young lord, but leſt an old lady, one Mrs.
O'Shockneſy, ſhould not only deſtroy the hopes of the young lady, by the
exerciſe of her power over him, but alſo thoſe of the gentleman, by
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing him with the money to pay off the mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.</p>
               <p>This marriage, which Emma gave us a hint of, 
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1185300302:255"/> operated as we ſhall hereafter have occaſion to
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, in a moſt extraordinary manner; but the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs at preſent
being to account for the reports againſt our hero, I ſhall go back to
Liſle, where the reader will recollect I entreated his particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to all that paſſed.</p>
               <p>Our hero had never ſeen Fluſh, and the two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were
ſo grown out of each other's remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that it is not wonderful they
ſhould remain in mutual ignorance till an accident unravelled the myſtery.
After Zekiel had retired, vowing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and left his brother maſter of the
field of battle, Kiddy, as we have ſeen, told him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge was very
eaſily in his power. He then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him of Madame St. Vivier's intention
to complete the happineſs of Charles that evening, and ſhewed him a chamber
which he ſaid and believed was hers. Zekiel, following the direction of his
truſty valet, was admitted to Kitty's bed room, and, in the full belief that
he was deceiving his brother, made as happy as he could wiſh.</p>
               <p>The queſtion here is, how came Fluſh, who was juſt
arrived, to know ſo well all theſe private mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? The anſwer is, by
Mrs. Kitty, who, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her miſtreſs, had been as well inſtructed
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1185300302:256"/> upon this occaſion by Mrs. O'Shockneſy, as Miſs
Snaffle had upon a former one.</p>
               <p>Fluſh, having the honour to know both the ladies, did not
ſcruple, when the ſquabble began between our hero and his brother, to
interrogate the waiting maid as to 
<q rend="inline">'how the cat jumped,'</q> as he called it, and,
having learnt from her the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the aſſignation, propoſed to
put Zekiel in the place of Charles, which ſhe promiſed, without intention
to perform; for ſhe knew if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected all their other deſigns on
our hero would be at an end; and, at the ſame time, ſhe feared a
diſcovery from Fluſh, for indeed he menaced it, if ſhe refuſed. She
therefore directed him to conduct Zekiel to her bed chamber, where he
paſſed the night, and the perſon who tapped at the door was Mr. Tadpole,
who having firſt knocked at his <hi>ſoidiſante</hi> ſiſter's, thought
he had miſtaken the room, and afterwards went to his own bed, for fear of
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſtakes.</p>
               <p>So completely however were all theſe croſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
acted, that Kitty believed the perſon who knocked at the door to be no other
than Mr. Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, who, in his turn, as has been ſhewn, was otherwiſe
employed. Kitty, however, having given <pb n="255" facs="tcp:1185300302:257"/> Madame St. Vivier
a hint of this buſineſs, ſhe burnt a light in her chamber, by which means
Charles came, as he informed Figgins, at the certainty of his not being
miſtaken.</p>
               <p>The moſt awkward circumſtance in this affair was the ſcene
which paſſed the next day in the poſt chaiſe between Zekiel and his two
companions.—Tadpole had taxed the young lady in the morning as to what
perſon was in her bed chamber; ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him it was the young lord;
they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſtoniſhed that he himſelf dropt no hint of it,
while, on his ſide, he trembled for fear any one ſhould have maliciouſly
diſcovered to them what he thought had really happened.</p>
               <p>This doubtful taciturnity gave Tadpole a notion that he was
inwardly hugging himſelf at his ſucceſs, and that probably having
ſtolen the poſſeſſion of the young lady, he might, for ſome
reaſon or other, ſlacken in his devoirs for the future. Miſs alſo had
ſuſpicions akin to theſe, and ſhe had once an idea of throwing
herſelf at her brother's feet, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of this opportunity, through
his authority, of exacting from Zekiel a written promiſe of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. She
refrained however, and it was well ſhe did. Tadpole ventured a few hints. He
ſaid he believed the devil had been let looſe the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:1185300302:258"/> in the inn, for he had heard ſuch running about and
knocking at doors, that he could not get a wink of ſleep. Zekiel blundered
out an awkward remark or two, Miſs ventured at a few leading queſtions,
and, in ſhort, they were all three on the verge of a diſcovery, which would
probably have overturned their reſpective intentions.</p>
               <p>It happened however that but one diſcovery came of it, and
that was confined to the knowledge of Tadpole and the young lady. It was, that
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body had been in bed with Miſs, which ſomebody was neither Zekiel
nor Tadpole. They therefore, for they had not an idea of Figgins, concluded it
to be Charles, and this thought dwelling in their imagination, preſented
itſelf as a bar to their ſcheme. Upon a conſultation on this ſubject
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, however, they reſolved it ſhould make no difference as to
their future meaſures, and their minds being thus made up—which the
reader will allow to be a pretty ſtrong inſtance of delicacy—all
matters went in their former channel.</p>
               <p>When they came to England it was agreed, on all hands, that Mrs.
O'Shockneſy and Standfaſt ſhould know no more of Mr. and Miſs Tadpole
than if there had been no ſuch perſons in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:1185300302:259"/> And now came, as Figgins called it,
maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroke the firſt. This gentleman correſponded with Mr.
Standfaſt, as did alſo Madame St. Vivier, whoſe real name was Jenny
Singleton, with Mrs. O'Shock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſy. From their accounts they had began to
frame an accuſation, which the arrival of Zekiel greatly improved, and which,
with its amendments, ſtood as in Standfaſt's letter.</p>
               <p>Theſe tidings were conveyed to Mr. Gloſs, who inſinuated
them into Sir Sidney's family as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſerved; and, as faſt as one
rumour died away, he broached another, that the good baronet might not be
ſuffered to cool.</p>
               <p>In this worthy buſineſs he found three very uſeful tools
in Muſquito, Ego, and Toogood; who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering, as Emma has told us, their
old grudge—eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when revived in its worſt lights by
Gloſs—were continually throwing out ſome hint to Charles's
diſadvantage. Muſquito ſaid the young fellow was mad, and becauſe he
had been tolerably educated, and puffed up with falſe applauſe, had, like
other ſpoilt children, thought he could carry all the world before him.
Toogood ſaid that he could not have believed a young man of ſuch
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing parts would ſo diſgrace all his friends, while 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1185300302:260"/> Ego declared that if he had been a young fellow bleſt
with ſo many advantages, he would have turned out the beſt creature in the
world. In ſhort, Gloſs made them play faſt and looſe, as he pleaſed,
and when they talked in exaggerating terms of his former pranks, he once
ventured in a mild way to reprobate the part Sir Sidney had taken in the
buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Swaſh and the taylor, ſaying he ſhould not wonder to
hear his acquieſcence upon that occaſion quoted as an excuſe for the
wretch's enormities.</p>
               <p>Theſe meaſures, together with the interception of Charles's
letters, which, by the bye, furniſhed Standfaſt, who received them, with a
moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable guide to the execution of his ſchemes, and now and then
ſome curſory intelligence from gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glemen juſt arrived from France, who
ſaw our hero drunk at an inn, or quarrelling in a coffee-houſe, where he
refuſed, notwithſtanding their earneſt ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſend any
letter or meſſage to England. All theſe I ſay worked his utter ruin in
the opinion of his friends; and yet, I muſt do Sir Sidney the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to
ſay he heſitated againſt what appeared to be poſitive conviction till
one morning news was brought that Lord Hazard was found ſhot through the
head, and that the act was certainly committed by himſelf, for one piſtol
lay cloſe by him, and <pb n="259" facs="tcp:1185300302:261"/> another was found loaded in his
pocket; and they were the ſame pair he had bought when he was laſt in
town.</p>
               <p>Two days after this melancholy accident John ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, who wept
over his old maſter's corpſe, ſaid he did not wonder at what had
happened, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards corroborated all that had been reported, did not ſpare
Figgins, and concluded with an account of Charles's being impriſoned at Lyons
for murder, producing, at the ſame time, a French Gazette, which gave the
particulars of the whole tranſaction. Under theſe appearances, with Gloſs
at his elbow, Sir Sidney wrote the letter we have ſeen.</p>

                  <p>CONTAINING A RECEIPT TO FORM A GREAT MAN—A VERY CURIOUS
INSTANCE OF FILIAL PIETY, AND ANOTHER OF MATRIMONIAL COMFORT.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAVING formerly hinted that Mr. Gloſs was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by
Standfaſt as a huſband for Annette, and again in the laſt chapter ſhewn
that theſe two gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen acted in concert in a fraud of no leſs
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence than what SHAKESPEARE, who well knew human nature, calls the
worſt of injuries—the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away a man's good name—I feel it
incumbent on me to account for the cloſe intimacy which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly did
ſubſiſt between them.</p>
               <p>When Gloſs came to England from Madeira, either accident, or
neceſſity, or ſomething—for it is not neceſſary now to be
particular—pointed out Mr. Standfaſt as a proper perſon to
aſſiſt him in his views of ſettling in this country.</p>
               <p>That reverend gentleman, ever ready to help out 
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1185300302:263"/> a genius—for this quality muſt be allowed to Mr.
Gloſs—adviſed him to trump up a ſtory of going to the Cape of Good
Hope, and then return, after go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to Madeira, where he actually had yet
ſome little buſineſs, and circulate a report that he had touched his
father's fortune, which, being in merchandiſe, he had only to change it into
money, to cut a figure.</p>
               <p>Being introduced to a number of tradeſmen, as a young nabob,
he preſently ſat himſelf down in a moſt elegant houſe, built a
<hi>vis a vis,</hi> and took up large quantities of goods: Standfaſt
ſupplying him with what ready money he was in abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of.</p>
               <p>Cutting this figure, and having his pretenſions backed by
Standfaſt, money was next borrowed, Snaffle and Dogbolt becoming
occaſionally colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſecurities; and this trade went on ſo
ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly, that in leſs than a year and a half they found their names
ſtanding out on different engagements for upwards of twenty-ſeven
thouſand pounds! twelve at leaſt of which Standfaſt had converted to his
own proper uſe: for the avarice of Mrs. O'Shockneſy was inſatiable, and
the poor gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doated on her to a degree of infatuation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:1185300302:264"/> Thus ſituated, their ruin collectively
was inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, if they could not ſtem this ſtorm, which now ſeemed to
be burſting over their heads. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſeemed to be how to manage
it, but to ſuch geniuſes all dangers were ſurmountable. Some hundreds
were laid out in India goods, to ſhew by way of ſample, which were bought
for exportation, to ſave the drawback, and afterwards clandeſtinely
relanded.</p>
               <p>Every poſſible exertion was made to give reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
and conſequence to the appearance of Mr. Gloſs. A large eſtate was
bargained for; nay he even went ſo far as to wait on the miniſter, to offer
an excluſive treaty for a loan. Thus his name rang in the newſpapers, and
the whole world, believing him to be in poſſeſſion of an immenſe
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, offered him any aſſiſtance he might think proper to command.
Large ſums were ſoon preſſed upon him, which went to ſatisfy ſuch
as would not ſhift the reſponſibility from his confederates ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to his. Others did not make any difficulty of doing this; ſo that after a
variety of negociations, Mr. Gloſs's name ſtood alone for the original
ſum of twenty-ſeven thouſand pounds, and ſeven added to it!</p>
               <p>What was the next ſtep? How was he to go on 
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1185300302:265"/> How ſkreen himſelf from his creditors? How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but by borrowing the writings of a friend's eſtate, and ſtanding for a
borough! He had given proofs of his abilities as a negociator; nobody knew the
theory of commerce better; who then ſo proper to fill an office under the
ſtate?</p>
               <p>He had fixed his eye on the treaſury ſhip of the navy, and I
have ſaid he had a knock of getting to any ſpot that he fixed his attention
on. A public acknowledgment that he was determined upon hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this poſt,
that is to ſay, whenever there ſhould be a miniſtry virtuous enough for
him to mix with, gained him his election.</p>
               <p>His ſpeech from the huſtings was very original, and
therefore very taking. In all addreſſes he had hitherto noticed, there were
a number of general promiſes, which were never performed. He, on the
contrary, reſolved to promiſe nothing but what his conſtituents were
ſure he would perform if he could.</p>
               <p>He began with ſaying that he had an intereſt in offering
himſelf for that borough, and ſo had every man living when he made a
ſimilar application; for would any one preſent, or in the world, exerciſe
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1185300302:266"/> his talents for nothing? This, he ſaid, was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
and, therefore, he had no doubt it would be popular. He went on with ſaying
he had watched with great attention the unhappy ſituation of this country,
and was ready to lend a helping hand to ſave it from impending ruin. For this
however he certainly expected a reward: and it was but juſt. Would a
phyſician ſave a life without a fee?—or a parſon a ſoul without
his tithes? It was folly, it was nonſenſe, it was hypocriſy, for men to
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend diſintereſtedneſs and mere love of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He loved his
country as well as any body; was as diſintereſted as any body; but ſtill,
patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and ſelf-denial could not imply, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance,
more than this: that while loaves and fiſhes are going forward, a man
ſhould eat only to ſatisfy nature, inſtead of guttling till he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
himſelf.</p>
               <p>He ſaid he would be plain, and fairly lay open all his views.
The navy of this nation was its bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, its glory. It was that which lent
millions to our treaſury, magnificence to our appearance, and terror to our
name. It was that which made us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and admired; dreaded and envied.
We made but a point on the face of the globe, but yet that point, though
ſmall, was reſplendant. It was <pb n="265" facs="tcp:1185300302:267"/> gazed at with wonder
by the remoteſt corners of the earth. We were the true Cynoſure of trade;
the commercial pole, that, with more than mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic force, attracted the
intereſts of ſurrounding nations. All this was owing to our navy: the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of our commerce. His ambition therefore was to be treaſurer of
that navy; in the execution of which office, though he expected to be paid for
his trouble, yet he would be bold to ſay his conduct would deſerve it: for
he was ſure he ſhould ſave immenſe ſums to the nation!</p>
               <p>He ſaid he deſpiſed profeſſions. They were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly,
ungenerous, and an inſult to thoſe to whom they were made: he had therefore
honeſtly opened his mind. That honeſty would, he doubted not, be a
ſufficient ſecurity with Engliſhmen, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural character was
honeſty, for his future good intentions. If he ſhould have the great honour
to be returned for the borough of Bray, and a miniſter ſhould come in of
ſufficient ability and integrity for him to act with, he would ſtipulate
for the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had ſet his heart upon, and they would then ſee how
the money would be handled! He would be bold to ſay, though it would be for
his intereſt, it ſhould alſo be for theirs: for the intereſts of the
member and his conſtituents were inſeperable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:1185300302:268"/> He finiſhed his ſpeech with ſaying
he ſcorned to appeal to their ears, he hoped he had appealed to their hearts;
and as their own conviction muſt teach them that truth, and only truth, had
been his guide, he hoped that honeſty, plain dealing, and unreſerved candor
would mark that day as an epoch when a member of parliament was choſen who
had no expectations but from honour, no views but from ſentiment.</p>
               <p>I need not add that Mr. Gloſs carried his elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for
notwithſtanding this florid ſpeech, which was indeed novel enough, he had
bought the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and the gentleman who conteſted the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was only a
nominal antagoniſt, ſet up to ſave appearances.</p>
               <p>This point being carried, the perſon of Mr. Gloſs was
ſacred, and his creditors might go whoop for their money. Exaſperated with
this treatment, his <hi>vis a vis</hi> was ſtopt in the ſtreet, and
executions ſerved in his houſe. But this was as uſeleſs as the reſt;
all his property was made over to Mr. Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, for money lent. And now we
ſee Mr. Gloſs without an inch of land he could call his own, nearly forty
thouſand pounds in debt, with a houſe and an equipage made over for
ſafety to another, a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="267" facs="tcp:1185300302:269"/> man, a popular
ſpeaker, almoſt the leader of a party, and making large ſtrides, with the
princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples we have ſeen, towards a reſponſible and lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive place
under government: for the treaſurerſhip of the navy he was determined to
have.</p>
               <p>As he really began to boaſt, and not without reaſon, of his
influence, he thought he could not attack Sir Sidney in a more vulnerable place
than his ancient houſe, which, from a long train of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral argument, he
proved to be older than the baronet himſelf had ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not go into the minutiae of this arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which
muſt not only be dry, but unintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the reader, who, I dare ſay,
would bate a little in the article of birth to ſuch as made up the deficiency
in honour—but only ſay that Mr. Gloſs made it out very clearly that
Sir Sidney was the only living iſſue of the family who held the honour of
the firſt Engliſh baronetcy, and offered to make a motion in the houſe,
which he ſhould ſupport with many powerful arguments, that his majeſty be
adviſed to grant to Sir Sidney Walter Roebuck, and his heirs for ever, an
excluſive patent of baronetcy, under the title of baronet in chief, to be
conſidered as an honour between that of a common baronet and a baron, in like
manner as a marquis is conſidered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <pb n="268" facs="tcp:1185300302:270"/> an earl and
a duke, and the precedent to be quoted, as an illuſtration of the argument,
was to be, that as there was but one real marquis—which was the caſe at
that time—ſo there ſhould be but one chief baronet.</p>
               <p>The baronet certainly liſtened to the propoſal, and turned
it a good deal in his mind, and though he doubted whether he ſhould avail
himſelf of ſuch an opportunity of aggrandizing his
family—eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as he had no ſon—yet, as he could ſee
nothing but attention to his intereſt in the conduct of Gloſs, he certainly
conceived from that moment a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for him. This was prodigiouſly
augmented by the attention this laſt mentioned gentleman paid to
Caſtlewick, and the actual advantage its intereſts received from his
advice, which both gave the baronet an inſight into his capacity, and
confirmed his good opinion of it. All theſe circumſtances co-operating, as
indeed Emma has already told us, no wonder if he had familiar entrance to his
houſe, afterwards to his heart, and at length an offer of his alliance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gloſs took care alſo to appear the friend of Charles;
but then his mediation never came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an inſinuation that he was more a
friend to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. In ſhort the two characters were ſo ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
contraſted in the mind of the baronet, that <pb n="269" facs="tcp:1185300302:271"/> without
any great ſtretch of propriety, the reader muſt allow, under theſe
circumſtances, that it is not to be wondered he ſhould turn about in the
manner I have deſcribed. Beſides—for I would fain ſum up every
trifling figure, to make the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of my reaſons upon ſo important a
point convincing—Sir Sidney felt a delicate, a nice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance, perhaps
too much ſo, at the idea of a connection with the ſon of a man who had
deſtroyed himſelf, and who had, aſſuredly, borne in his youth a very
bad character.</p>
               <p>Again, he plainly foreſaw that all his benevolent attempts at
Little Hockley would ſoon be fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by the innovations of the young
lord; for it was not yet ſo firmly rooted but that, owing to a new crew of
revellers, it began already to loſe ground. This, and the recollection of the
ancient feuds, which he now feared would be renewed, heartily conquered his
inclination to be in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect allied to the family of Lord Hazard, though
he admired the talents of our hero, and really had ſuch a value for him as to
wiſh his welfare, though he doubted whether he would ever deſerve it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Standfaſt and Mrs. O'Shockneſy muſt now become a
little the ſubject of our attention. That gentleman and lady had been
ſometime married: <pb n="270" facs="tcp:1185300302:272"/> but it was the wiſh of both that
it ſhould not be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. She brought with her a comfortable number of
debts, and being now a <hi>femme couverte,</hi> very ſoon contracted a number
more. In ſhort, there were no bounds to her extravagance, which Mr.
Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſt ſeemed as anxious to feed as ſhe to indulge.—His own
income, including a living the gift of my lord, his annuity from that nobleman,
the intereſt of his legacy from Major Malplaquet, and what he had beſides
been able to realize—for no object upon earth, except Mrs. O'Shockneſy,
had been ſixpence expence to him—was about ſeventeen hundred a year;
the lady had three; yet we have lately ſeen above twelve thouſand added to
their income in a year and a half! But what was this? He doated on her as
implicitly, as rapturouſly, and as boyiſhly as Barn well did on Millwood,
and threw large ſums into her lap as willingly, whenever he could ſteal
them: for I think the means he uſed to get at them might very well be called
theft. On her ſide, no dutcheſs muſt dare to vie with her in taſte and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. But every ſource from whence this profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was ſupplied at
length dried up. Mr. Gloſs being in parliament, nobody would truſt him; and
thus the whole credit of the confederacy was at a ſtand. Beſides, Lord
Hazard, who was expected to grieve himſelf to death for the loſs of his
wife and the irregularities of his ſon, was yet alive, and 
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:1185300302:273"/> had no diſorder but ſorrow, which, though
immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, did not ſeem likely to kill him. What joy then to the heart of
this lady to hear he was no more!—to find her ſon in full
poſſeſſion of more than thirteen thouſand a year, the whole of which
ſhe intended to command! Her tranſport knew no bounds! She beſpoke a new
carriage and new liveries, and bowled down into Warwickſhire in the moſt
ſuperb and magnificent ſtyle that money could procure or faſhion invent:
taking with her ſuch domeſtics for her ſon as ſhe conceived proper for
his ſituation in life. In ſhort nothing could equal the triumph with which
ſhe thought herſelf ſure of taking poſſeſſion of both her ſon's
ſenſes and his affairs. Judge then what was her aſtoniſhment when
flying to his arms he ſtopt her by introducing his wife, being no other than
the very Miſs Tad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole that Figgins, to uſe his own words, dubbed him with
by anticipation at Liſle! What then did ſhe feel! Words are not ſtrong
enough to deſcribe her ſenſations. It took her breath away. She raved,
ſtampt, laughed, execrated, and would probably have died with the violence of
her paſſion, had not a ſhower of tears borne away the firſt torrent of
that complication of diſtreſsful feelings which aſſailed her. At length
ſhe accompliſhed ſomething like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate utterance, when the whole
ſchool of Billingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, had it been preſent, might have heard and 
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1185300302:274"/> edified. No opprobrious name that could be
ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly ſpoken or maliciouſly applied, was unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered. His
lordſhip—ſurely no lord was ever ſo called before—was a
pitiful raſcal, a nincompoop, a hop o' my thumb, a paltry puppy, and a
pimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcoundrel. The lady was a ſcurvy jade, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hunting minx, a
low wretch, and a ſorry trull.</p>
               <p> Zekiel laughed at all the abuſe on himſelf, but taking fire
at the inſults offered to his wife, cried, 
<q rend="inline">'I'll tell you what it is ma'am; I know you
ſee what you'd be at, but dam'me let me tell you dam'me that I am out of my
leading ſtrings, dam'me if I 'ent, and I won't no longer be ſchooled, d'ye
ſee, by any old cat in England.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Old cat!' ſcreamed out the lady
dowager.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The young lady here interfered, and begged her huſband to
conſider he was talking to his mother.—
<q rend="inline">'To my mother,' cried he, 'why ſo I know I am,
and a pretty mother ſhe is, now is not ſhe, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe you and I in this
here manner? Why I know'd what ſhe was upon; ſhe thought to come here and
be lady paramount of every thing, and ſnub and ding me about like a lout and
a ſchool boy; but dam'me if I'll have any ſuch doings: no, I won't old
gentlewoman, I'll aſſure you. I know in a week, if ſhe was to be here,
ſhe'd be <pb n="273" facs="tcp:1185300302:275"/> whole and fole; nay I ſhould not wonder if
ſhe wanted at laſt to take my ſeat from me in the houſe of lords. But
hold, now I think on't ſhe has been there once too often already.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You brute!' exclaimed his mother. 'You
wretch!—you undutiful curſed devil! Oh I could tear your eyes
out!'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I dare ſay you could,' cried the young lord,
'but I'll tell you what mother, if I am ſo unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, you had better go away
from ſuch a curſed devil, for to tell you the truth I never intended you
ſhould live with my wife, ſeeing as how it was not unlikely you would
adviſe her to play me a trick or ſo with my <hi>valet de
chambre.</hi>'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. O'Shockneſy could contain herſelf no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: ſhe ran
to his ſword, and drawing it half way out of the ſcabbard, ſwore ſhe
would murder him. Lady Hazard here ſcreamed ſo loud that Tadpole, who had
been walking in the garden, came to their aſſiſtance, and demanded what
was the matter.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'The matter?' cried Zekiel; 'only my old mother
wants ſo ſend me poſt to the other world, <pb n="274" facs="tcp:1185300302:276"/>
becauſe I reminded her a little of the follies of her youth. God bleſs the
good gentlewoman,' add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, 'do now pray go home, waſh the paint off your
ſaded jaws, and chuckle to old Standfaſt.—Why do you think I have not
been up to all the rum gig? Why yes I have; but it was no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of
mine, you know, while I could coax you out of the ready. Now, d'ye ſee, I can
ſupply myſelf, and thanks to nobody:—ſo every one for himſelf,
and God for us all. Mr. Standfaſt has two or three goodiſh things: they may
keep you ſnug enough, if you have a mind to live pretty and decent, as an old
gentlewoman ought. As for me I intend to live nobly, and ſpend my money like
a man!'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'But ſtill my lord,' ſaid Tadpole—</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'Brother Tadpole,' interrupted Zekiel, 'I'll be
damned if I live in the ſame houſe with a wife and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and there's
it d'ye ſee. That being the maxim of the thing, you had better, old lady, as
I ſaid before, go back again; and it may be as well for you to keep a quiet
tongue, and adviſe Maſter Standfaſt to do the ſame, or it may be the
worſe for both you, d'ye ſee, and the rum duke too.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have neither time nor inclination, nor indeed 
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1185300302:277"/> capacity to paint the fury of the lady, at her leaving
the houſe, which ſhe did ſoon after. Every bitter wiſh her invention
could ſupply was laviſhed on her ſon. Among the reſt, I think ſhe
ſaid ſhe hoped to her ſoul he would be both a beggar and a cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old.</p>
               <p>The lady's return to Mr. Standfaſt, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by
buſineſs from accompanying her into the country, was truly a curious one.
She blamed him for every thing, which was her uſual method when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any
thing miſcarried; and he, as uſual, bore his jobation with aſtoniſhing
coolneſs. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked her: her paſſion then provoked him: one epithet
begat another, till he was all the old, ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, doting idiots that her
fertile fancy could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; and ſhe was, by his account, the damnedeſt
infernal hell-cat that ever was born to curſe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy raſcal like
him.</p>
               <p>From ſtorming they went to upbraiding then they proceeded to
the ſituation of their affairs, which were found to be plunged over head and
ears in difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This, in ſpight of them, brought on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, and
that upbraided them with the infamous practices they had been guilty of to
ſerve an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful wretch, who, after he had mounted to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence by their

                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:1185300302:278"/> that raiſed him! And here I cannot help remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the very devil for whom they had been ſo long toiling, his ends
accompliſhed, ſpit in their faces, and forſook them.</p>

                  <p>IN WHICH MORE KNOTTY POINTS ARE CLEARED UP.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE reader will judge right if he fancies this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of
Mrs. O'Shockneſy was a concerted thing between my lord and his brother in
law, who was now his ſteward, as was Fluſh his butler. Indeed, as every
ſervant formerly in the houſe was by this time replaced by others, brought
in at the inſtance of theſe two friends, his lordſhip was doomed to be as
much in leading ſtrings as ever his mother could have held him for the life
of her; but as he was ſuffered in every thing to have his own way, he did not
concern himſelf with what they did privately, but let them feather their
neſts in quiet, under the idea of taking all his affairs off his hands,
becauſe he was a man of rank, in whom it was vulgar to let buſineſs
interfere with pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tadpole and Mr. Kiddy underſtood one another very well,
for the latter had, while they were in France, made a diſcovery, of which the
reader ſhall ſome time hence participate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:1185300302:280"/> A ſecret to a miniſter of ſtate, or
his type, a great man's butler, is a matter of ſome conſequence.—Here
then Fluſh ſet up his reſt. It is true he ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced, when he firſt came
to England, and was within a hair's breadth of deſtroying all Tadpole's
hopes, by making the above diſcovery to his old maſter Standfaſt; but
that gentleman making him ſome propoſal or other that he did not like, he
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted before he had ſo explained himſelf as to betray Tadpole, and
matters having ſince turned out ſo much to his advantage, he thanked his
ſtars that he had now ſat himſelf down comfortably for life.</p>
               <p>Whether Kiddy was tired of his youthful follies, or whether his
whirligig inclinations had wearied themſelves with turning round, I know not,
but he ſeemed like a worn-out weathercock to be glad to ruſt where he had
ſtopt: and this choice was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in a total alteration in his manners.
He went to church, nay more, he was very often cloſeted with a methodiſt
preacher, with whom he got drunk, and ſang pſalms.</p>
               <p> The young lord uſed to ſmoke this, as he called it, and
gave him many a dry rub, to one of which ſallies he one day replied, 
<q rend="inline">'Why Lord love your <pb n="279" facs="tcp:1185300302:281"/>
lordſhip, my lord, when you come to repent, as I do, of all your worldly gig,
and are down upon the heavenly comfort of a religious life, you may tell the
old rum codger with his hour glaſs, come when he will, you are up to all he
knows, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as ſome old learned gentleman ſays, whether you
cloſe your peepers in ſleep or in death.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Emma, who, as ſhe informed our hero, was up on the watch, no
ſooner heard of Kiddy's conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but knowing he muſt be full of good
intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for her, determined to tamper with him: not that ſhe had any
expectation of finding him leſs a hypocrite in his new calling than in his
old one. She therefore ſaw there might be danger in putting her deſigns in
execution perſonally. In fact Emma ſaw herſelf of conſequence in the
very way ſhe had all her life wiſhed to be; for ſhe was convinced ſhe
ſhould have it in her power, in the language of thoſe romances ſhe ſo
dearly loved, to conduct two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant lovers to the temple of Felicity,
through all the briars and bogs that impeded their paſſage.—Fluſh
ſhe pitched upon as the vehicle in this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome journey, which Swaſh
and his daughter were to guide, while ſhe herſelf, like ſome tutelary
genius, ſhould watch their motions, inſpire them <pb n="280" facs="tcp:1185300302:282"/>
with courage on the road, and remove all difficulties in their paſſage to
this deſirable goal.</p>
               <p>In leſs figurative language, ſhe ſet Swaſh, who with
good reaſon loved Charles moſt ſincerely, to inſinuate himſelf into
Fluſh's good graces, who, I can tell you, had already began to love homage,
ſo little had the ſpirit mended his humility.</p>
               <p>It was in the miller's inſtructions never to mention a word of
our hero, or, if he found that unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to cover any ſuſpicion of his
friendſhip, by railing againſt him, but at the ſame time to cheriſh all
that dropt from Fluſh—who now, for diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, began to be called
Canting Kiddy—that could in the remoteſt degree lead to any
circumſtance that implied a plot having been formed againſt him.</p>
               <p>As to Jude, her part was a capital one, and had ſhe not been
perfected in it by a very capable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructreſs, ſhe might have ſpoilt
all.</p>
               <p>Kiddy, it was notorious, loved a pretty girl; Judy was
inſtructed to throw herſelf in his way, to give an account of his
behaviour, and proceed ſtep by ſtep as ſhe ſhould be directed by Emma.
It was foreſeen her virtue would be attacked, but this was 
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1185300302:283"/> the very cunning of the ſcene. Whenever this ſhould
happen to be the caſe, ſhe was directed to draw, in her ſimple way, a
pathetic picture of the wickedneſs of mankind, and lament the blindneſs of
the world, who could load the preſerver of her innocence with unmerited
reproaches, while he who was ſeeking to deſtroy it had the character of
ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and penitence. They were not ſo mad how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as to truſt to
Judy's prudence alone, nor her rhetoric, for force might overcome both: Swaſh
therefore was to be at hand upon any trying occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to reſcue her, which
being romantic, was ſtill more to Emma's taſte.</p>
               <p>If ſhe ſhould get at any material evidence, her next ſtep
was to ſtrengthen her own weak force by the alliance, as ſhe ſhould think
fit, of either Mr: Friend or Mr. Balance, or both; and as ſhe ſaw many
obſtacles would lie in the way, particularly the buſineſs of Gloſs,
ſhe adviſed Annette to avow implicitly her affection for Charles, which her
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had formerly authoriſed, and who would not ſo far contradict his
own excellent character as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on her marrying one man before ſhe
had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the other. Beſides Mr. Gloſs was not yet trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer of the
navy, and therefore could not make thoſe offers as to fortune which a man of
Sir Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's <pb n="282" facs="tcp:1185300302:284"/> rank and poſſeſſions would of
courſe expect, eſpecially when he became chief baronet; which
circumſtance, ridiculous as it was, really at times occupied his reflections:
for what man is there, let him be ever ſo good or ever ſo wiſe, but has
his weak ſide.</p>
               <p>All this jumble or chaos of circumſtances were fluctuating at
this time in Emma's head, out of which ſhe had no doubt but ſhe ſhould
form a world of happineſs for the young couple.</p>
               <p>Matters being in this ſtate as to our hero in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, the
reader and I will once more take a trip to the continent, in which journey we
cannot do better than follow the ſteps of Madame St. Vivier and her handmaid
Kitty, whoſe private motives being made clearer—which ſeems very
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary—this hiſtory will ſtand as diſentangled as any one
could reaſonably deſire who wiſhes things to be brought forward in their
natural order.</p>
               <p>It has been ſeen that I am not very fond of dwelling upon
trifling circumſtances, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without mentioning a word of
theſe ladies bringing up, ſay that Madame St. Vivier was a faſhionable
woman of the town, and that Miſs Kitty, <pb n="283" facs="tcp:1185300302:285"/> though her
handmaid, had been in no leſs a ſphere of life than herſelf. Indeed, but
a very few years before, ſhe had cut a figure little leſs brilliant than
Mrs. O'Shockneſy, but falling in love with either the beauty or the brogue of
Mr. Ireland, ſhe had really attached herſelf to him with a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
degree of conſtancy for a lady of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>When this gentleman was obliged to abſcond, in conſequence
of his duel, he left his affairs in the hands of an intimate friend, who
thought proper to take no other notice of the truſt, than by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating
every thing to his own uſe, without remitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his friend abroad, or allowing
the lady at home, a ſingle ſixpence: ſo that in this caſe Kiddy's
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark of honour among thieves did not apply.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Kitty having been ſometime out of the way of
practice—for faſhion has as much to do in theſe caſes as
beauty—had recourſe to her old friend Jenny Singleton, who began juſt
then alſo to be on the decline, and propoſed a viſit to Sedan, where Mr.
Ireland then was, with a view to conſult him on their future operations.</p>
               <p>This expedition was lucky enough, for Mr. Gloſſ 
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1185300302:286"/> coming acroſs them, they were tutored by Mrs.
O'Shockneſy how to make their journey worth while.</p>
               <p>Figgins gave them intelligence concerning the departure of
Charles; and, as it had been concerted, they met him at Dover.</p>
               <p>The ladies however, determined to make all ſure, had privately
agreed to act in the very manner Figgins has deſcribed; for their experience
gave them reaſon to believe that it was not impoſſible but Mr. Ireland
might forget to give them the meeting. They therefore were in appearance to be
alternately miſtreſs and maid, both to ſave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to keep their
ſecrets to themſelves, and alſo to avail themſelves of any opportunity
that might happen of ſnapping up any Engliſh booby, by way of completing
his tour for improvement.</p>
               <p>Matters turned out however very much to their ſatisfaction.
They met with Mr. Ireland at Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan; he attended them to Nancy, where, as it
has been ſeen, he plundered our hero of a tolerable ſupply. Nor did he
abſolutely part with them, but hovered about as it were, till his affairs
called him into Italy, to which place—after robbing our hero 
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1185300302:287"/> of every thing they could lay their hands on, as we
heard Figgins inform him—theſe two kind ladies followed him.</p>

                  <p>A JESUITICAL EXPLANATION—THE SEPARATION OF TWO
FRIENDS—AND AN ANSWER TO EMMA'S LETTER.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF the reader and I were unfeeling enough to leave Charles in
ſuch a ſituation that death ſeemed almoſt deſirable to him, Mr.
Figgins appears to have been more ſolicitous about him, for in leſs than
half an hour after the melancholy moment wherein I deſcribe him reading his
father's letters, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with great pleaſure in his countenance, took
his friend by the hand, and giving him joy, told him he was liberated!</p>
               <p>Charles, going from one extreme to the other, was enraptured at
the news, and requeſted to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how ſo unexpected an event had been
brought about. Figgins anſwered him that they were in no place to ſatisfy
his curioſity. They were then joined by their attorney, who had ſtayed
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind to pay the fees of the priſon; and now the jailor, who a little
before had earneſtly examined <pb n="287" facs="tcp:1185300302:289"/> our hero's chains, to
ſee if they were faſt enough, came with great ceremony to unfaſten
them.</p>
               <p>This and all other punctilios over, they ſallied forth, and
Charles and Figgins being arrived at their inn, the latter thus accounted for
his friend's enlargement.</p>
               <p>Mr. Figgins ſaid that no ſingle day had paſt ſince his
friend's impriſonment but ſome ſtep had been taken to get at the truth of
the unhappy buſineſs, which had been the means of his ſuffering in ſo
worthy a cauſe. The accounts had been for a good while various and
unſatisfactory, and therefore he determined, as he had enough in all
conſcience to vex him without being eternally tortured with ſuch
ſuſpenſe, not to ſay a word till ſome certain intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence ſhould
arrive. He ſaid the firſt clue he had of any thing like a chance of
ſucceſs, though he took no notice of it at the time, was his friend's
ſaying he was ſure he had ſomewhere ſeen the murderer. This put it into
his head—though he owned it was a conjecture greatly at random. 
<q rend="inline">'But.' added he 'I would catch as much at a
ſtraw for my friend's ſafety as my own. That Ireland, who was a great
duelliſt, was probably the man.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'And by heaven,' ſaid Charles, 'I do believe 
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:1185300302:290"/> he was; though it never ſtruck me ſo till this
moment.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You ſhall hear,' ſaid Figgins.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I was inclined the more to believe this on
hearing his name men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in an odd way by Madame St. Vivier, with whom I now
began to think he had maintained ſome intelligence all along; for I
recollected that it dropt from her at Nancy that ſhe had ſeen him in
England. This ſet me upon interrogating Kitty, who confeſſed his having
been at Lyons, and that very probably he was the guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I was now convinced they knew it. Thinking
therefore to practiſe the trick your brother taught us at Liſle, I ordered
John to enquire every day at the poſt-office, and to bring me any letters
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Madame St. Vivier. He, I ſuppoſe, made them acquainted with
theſe inſtructions, for after waiting till about three weeks ago, to no
purpoſe, I was juſt thinking what other method I could hit upon, when, all
on a ſudden, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Mr. John decamped, as I imagined, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but
we have ſince learnt he went to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Women cannot ſo eaſily travel ſecretly in
France <pb n="289" facs="tcp:1185300302:291"/> as men. I therefore ſoon found out their route,
which, as I ſuſpected, led to where Mr. Ireland was waiting for them. My
firſt intention was to have purſued them myſelf, but reflecting I
ſhould be of more uſe to you upon the ſpot, I got, by the interference of
our banker, a very intelligent young man to go in my ſtead.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'The inſtructions given to this young man were
not to act ſo as to endanger Mr. Ireland—for that I knew you did not
wiſh—but only to get from him ſuch ſort of ſatisfaction as
ſhould acquit you.—The firſt part of this injunction was
unneceſſary, for though he overtook the ladies in the kingdom of France,
the gentleman was ſafe in the confines of Savoy. They however, fearing for
themſelves, ſerved him as a guide, and coming at length to where Mr.
Ireland had appointed them, he did you ample juſtice, making voluntary oath
that you had no part in the fray, but that of a mediator, and that ſo far
from having any malice, you could not poſſibly know either the quarrel or
its cauſe; for that all you did was merely the effect of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and
entirely with a view to prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'This confeſſion, ſo ſworn—which
is now lodged <pb n="290" facs="tcp:1185300302:292"/> to ground your diſcharge upon—he
accompanied with this letter, which you will find attributes the duel to the
haſtineſs of the gentleman who unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately fell. He talks of
unhandſome reflections againſt Engliſhmen in general, and him in
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. In ſhort, be the cauſe of quarrel what it may, he had it in
his power to palliate the matter as he thought proper, for there are no
witneſſes to contradict him.</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Thus,' added he, 'my noble friend, you are at
liberty, and I offer myſelf to avenge you on your enemies in any way you may
think proper to point out for me.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Charles thanked him heartily, but ſaid his only revenge would
be contemptuous indifference.</p>
               <p>In ſome parts of this account Mr. Figgins ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the truth,
and in others fell ſhort of it. He had not ſet John to enquire about
letters; he had not taken a hint from our hero as to Ireland; he had not wormed
the matter out of the ladies. On the contrary, a note had been received
explanatory of Ireland's flight on the very morning it happened, and the
intelligence had not been protracted out of tenderneſs to Charles, but to
cover the ſafety of the ſugitive; for though a gentleman was ſent, as 
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:1185300302:293"/> our hero was informed, and did actually return with the
letter and oath already mentioned, yet Madame St. Vivier, who, to do her
juſtice, was as willing as any body to ſave Charles, ſtipulated however
that no arrangement ſhould take place till Mr. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſhould be fully out
of danger. Then again there was no part of the conduct of theſe ladies
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him. He knew why they went to Sedan; he was acceſſary to the
loſs of the money at Nancy; he even learnt that Kitty and Ireland were upon
the beſt terms; he conſented when they went away to their taking that money
of which he pretended to have been robbed; and, laſtly, ſo far from not
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with John's departure for England, he ſent him there,
and—not to hide the truth—with proper inſtructions how our hero
ſhould be written to: ſo that he knew every word of Mr. Standfaſt's
letter before Charles received it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Figgins now began to be very inquiſitive as to our hero's
future plan. Charles ſaid he ſhould immediately write to Mr. Balance, and
if he found him willing to ſupply him without the ceremony of going to
England, he ſhould continue his tour as he originally intended; 
<q rend="inline">'for,' ſaid he, 'I ſee nothing in my native
country that ſhould make me deſirous of returning to it.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:1185300302:294"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Nor I either,' ſaid Figgins, 'except it were
to curſe them all round.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Pretty advice indeed,' ſaid Charles, with a
laugh: 'want a man deliberately to go ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles for no better
purpoſe than to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a paſſion.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well then may I be damned,' ſaid Figgins, 'if
I think there is your fellow upon the face of the earth. Such prudence and
diſcernment at your age is truly aſtoniſhing.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reader ſees that Figgins did not want Charles to go to
England, but as he well knew the right kind of argument to hold with mankind,
the ſtronger Charles's obſtinacy appeared, the more he argued againſt it.
He ſhewed how eaſy it would be to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive Sir Sidney. He painted the
beauties of Annette; the danger of loſing her; the triumph of obtaining her
from his rival; till at length, being highly exhilirated with wine, he had
reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of his warmth, for Charles, in the heat of his vivacity,
ſaid ſomething that implied a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to return.</p>
               <p>Fortune however, envious perhaps of his having ſo narrowly
eſcaped an untimely end, or thinking <pb n="293" facs="tcp:1185300302:295"/> the hero of
ſuch a hiſtory as this had not been long enough upon his probation, or bent
upon bringing about his cataſtrophe, whatever it be, by the means of Mrs.
Emma, her agent, or for ſome other equally wiſe and conſiderate motive,
determined to give Charles good time to deliberate, before he ſhould come to
any reſolution; for he was that night taken with a violent fever, which
laſting him ſeveral days without the ſmalleſt intermiſſion, and
ſeveral weeks with but very little, he was at length left in a moſt
emaciated condition, with all the ſymptoms of a gradual decline.</p>
               <p>The moment he was able he wrote to Mr. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, without however
dropping a hint of his ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which precaution he enjoined Figgins alſo
to obſerve, thinking, probably, it would look like an overture to a
reconciliation, which, had he even wiſhed, his pride would have forbid him to
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</p>
               <p>Indeed he was pretty reſolute as to his future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;
for though his bodily ſtrength was greatly impaired, his mental faculties
were at leaſt as ſtrong as ever.</p>
               <p>This was the only ſerious illneſs he had ever had in his
life. It had given him excellent time for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, <pb n="294" facs="tcp:1185300302:296"/>
and the more he reflected the leſs he ſaw to be aſhamed of. In proportion
therefore as he found himſelf wronged, he perſiſted in his firm
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to conſider himſelf independant, and accountable to no man
for his actions: and, as to enjoy the full poſſeſſion of ſuch
principles he muſt not have many friendſhips, he reſolved to continue his
tour, that, by gathering a plentiful ſtock of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, he might be
the better qualified to find a friend in himſelf.</p>
               <p>This ſcheme he was alſo determined to purſue after his own
fancy, which part he digeſted as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately as the reſt. Taking
therefore an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity one day, when the phyſician adviſed him to try
the air of Montpelier, he thus opened his mind to his friend Figgins.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'My dear ſir, it would be but a poor return to

you can without doubt employ to greater advantage in the boſom of your family

               <p>It happened luckily for Mr. Figgins, that this was the very
ſubject he had himſelf been two or three times on the point of broaching,
but he felt ſo awkward about it that he could not for the ſoul of him tell
how to begin. Having however the ice broken for him, he did not ſcruple to
acknowledge <pb n="296" facs="tcp:1185300302:298"/> that his affairs at home were rather in a
diſordered condition, and that he ſincerely believed, were he on the
ſpot, a certain biſhop would at that time have an opportunity of promoting
him: but yet he could not think of leaving his dear, his honoured friend; it
would look as if he was of a piece with the reſt of the world, and had
baſely deſerted his cauſe.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">'Rather,' ſaid Figgins, if I am induced to

apparent reluctance on the other, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon that our hero and Mr.

friendſhip, and future attention to each other's intereſt—on one
ſide I am ſure very ſincere—and a firm promiſe to keep up a
regular correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>Not two days after the departure of Mr. Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, Charles wrote
to Mr. Balance, by whom he had been treated, as to his money, in a very
gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemanly manner, deſiring, without giving a ſingle reaſon, that he
would immediately grant out of his fortune a hundred a year to Mr. Figgins for
life; and about four hours after this letter was diſpatched, he received one
from Emma, informing him of his brother's actual marriage—and alſo that
Lady Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard was in a way to bleſs him with a ſon and heir—the
diſcomfiture of the Lady Dowager; the unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <pb n="298" facs="tcp:1185300302:300"/>
inflexibility of Sir Sidney; the neutrality of Lady Roebuck; the conſtancy of
Annette; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation on his releaſe, which they had all heard from
ſome ſpy in the camp; to which ſhe added, pray God Mr. Figgins prove not
rather an Euriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus than a Pylades; a gentle reproach for his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; an
exhortation to return; 
<q rend="inline">'but indeed,' ſaid ſhe, 'to what purpoſe?
Juſtice, come as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as it may, can now ſcarcely make you amends. Of
what uſe was the pyramid to Aeſop after they had hurled him from the

bloſſomed, and borne fruit, ſhe doubted not but ſhe ſhould gather a

               <p>Charles had not anſwered Emma's former letter, it is true, but
he was determined now to do ſo once for all. This was his letter.

               <argument>
                  <p>CONTAINING AN EVENT WHICH, HOWEVER SAGACIOUS THE READER MAY
BE, WILL NOT BE ANTICIPATED.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>CHARLES continued in a very weak ſtate. As ſoon therefore as
he had received from Mr. Balance ſuch kind of authority as enabled him to
find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in caſh, travel where he might, he complied with his
phyſician's advice, and removed, by ſhort ſtages, to Montpelier, with
only a <hi>valet de chambre</hi> and a <hi>laquais,</hi> both Frenchmen: his
intention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhun the Engliſh as much as poſſible.</p>
               <p>His diſorder for ſome time gave every appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that if
the malignity of his friends went ſo far as to wiſh him in the other world,
they would ſoon be ſatisfied. Perhaps ſome of them might have been happy
to have contemplated his ſituation.—Their charitable expectations
however would have been diſappointed, for his youth and conſtitution
triumphed over the conſumption, and, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was a greater victory,
over the united efforts of the phyſicians; and at length—but not in
leſs <pb n="303" facs="tcp:1185300302:305"/> than ſeven months—his recovery was
pronounced to be certain.</p>
               <p>I might here draw a ſtriking picture enough of a young man of
rank and fortune, with excellent talents, an admirable heart, young,
handſome, and ſweet tempered, without a ſingle fault that might not be
defended upon principles of reaſon, hemmed in by an hoſt of enemies, and
apparently dying by himſelf in a remote corner of a ſtrange kingdom. All
this interſperſed with apt obſervation, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed with proper
reflections, would indeed make up good moral matter in this place, and give me
an opportunity of finiſhing the ſecond volume with ſome very pretty,
round, well-turned reading:—but the buſineſs of this hiſtory
is—as indeed I think every other ought to be—action, which I give
the reader warning will be more and more rapid as we go on. I therefore beg,
that whoever ſhall wiſh I had pauſed at ſuch and ſuch a place, and
given my muſe a bait, cramming down every mouthful with a moral ſentence,
will ſupply that ſentence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which will be more than one
advantage to me: it will ſave me the trouble; it will be more to the taſte
of every reader; and it will give free ſcope to all thoſe who think with
me, to go on without ſkipping.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:1185300302:306"/> Charles did not want company at
Montpelier, for he did not want money. He had officers and abbes out of number,
and ſometimes ladies, and now and then an Engliſh gentleman in misfortunes,
who was not the worſe for his trouble in viſiting him. At other times he
read the beſt authors, and never loſt any opportunity of ſpeaking French,
which he at laſt accompliſhed correctly and elegantly.</p>
               <p>His health was re-eſtabliſhed ſooner than his ſtrength.
On this account he ſlowly viſited moſt of the towns in the ſouth of
France, where he met with a variety of characters, with whoſe hiſtories,
were I ſo diſpoſed, I could interlard my book, till, as I once heard an
Iriſhman ſay of a bad play, the main plot would be all epiſode. I ſhall
however, which is modeſt enough, chuſe but one, and now we are talking of
Iriſhmen, it ſhall be a gentleman of that country; he ſhall be a monk,
called Father Fitzgibbon, and member of a convent of Benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</p>
               <p>Our hero, becauſe perhaps he was in a wine country—for
ſick people are very whimſical—took it in his head to long for ſome
beer; an inclination however he did not ſeem likely to gratify, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
had been repeatedly made for that beverage to <pb n="305" facs="tcp:1185300302:307"/> purpoſe.
His valet, who had a moſt indulgent maſter—and they ſay a good
maſter makes a good ſervant—determining not to give the matter up
quietly, procured intelligence that about two leagues off there was a convent
of Engliſh, Iriſh, and Scotch, where, for their own uſe, they brewed
excellent beer. To this convent, without ſaying a word to Charles, he
poſted. Having told his ſtory, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for anſwer, that they brewed
the beer for their own uſe, as he had heard, but, nevertheleſs, if upon
paying them a viſit they ſhould like the gentleman, they would ſupply him
with as much as he could drink. A card to this effect was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched,
inviting Charles to dine with them the next day. He obeyed that ſummons and
ſeveral others, till, what with the beer, the good company, and the ride,
which I believe had moſt merit—as the air in Wales performs that cure
which the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians attribute to the goat's milk—in a ſhort time he
found himſelf in perfect health.</p>
               <p>I ſhould not have mentioned this circumſtance ſo minutely
had I not deſigned to introduce Father Fitzgibbon, who was ſuperior of this
convent, to the reader, and I ſhould not have introduced Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fitzgibbon
to the reader if I had not had a material reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:1185300302:308"/> This friar was, as I have ſaid, a
native of Ireland. He was of a good family, but being a younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he
quitted Dublin and went to Bath—the uſual market—in ſearch of a
fortune. There he contrived to lodge in the ſame houſe, where lodged alſo
an ancient lady and her daughter, the widow and heireſs of an old hunks, who
had amaſſed a large fortune by boiling blubber at Deptford. It was
immaterial to him which he married, but he was determined upon one of them, and
that one ſhould be her who was richeſt. This his intelligencers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
him was the daughter, who being very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and conceited, and beſides
beſet hard, yielded upon eaſier terms than marriage, which conditions the
Iriſhman did not boggle about, becauſe for why, ſaid he, 
<q rend="inline">'ſure can't I make you very happy after I have
ruined you for ever.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The appointment being made when and where this forward young
lady, for the firſt time, was to yield up the poſſeſſion of her
perſon to her intended huſband, Fitzgibbon, which is not extraordinary in
an Iriſhman, made a blunder; for, miſtaking his way, inſtead of Miſs's
room, he got into her mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's, who expected a gallant likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Before the morning they diſcovered their mutual miſtake, and
before the next morning Fitgibbon, <pb n="307" facs="tcp:1185300302:309"/> prevailed on the old
lady to rob the young lady of her fortune, with which they ſet off for
France, and of which money, three years after, when this antiquated Venus died,
he had juſt enough left to purchaſe a commiſſion in the Iriſh
brigades. To be brief: After much riotous conduct, and many miſdemeanours, he
was broken, when the church,—which is in France ſomething like what we
ſay in England of the ſea and the gallows—received him.</p>
               <p>He had been ſuperior of this convent of Benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines four
years, and at the end of three more he was to viſit his own country for a
twelvemonth, when he aſſured our hero he would ſpend a month with him in
England.</p>
               <p>For a few hours, at a time of vacant hilarity, Charles could not
be in more agreeable company. He laid himſelf out for their convenience,
ſent them ſeveral deſirable preſents, and left, at his departure, a
handſome donation, which Fitzgibbon did not ſcruple to tell him, in a
whiſper, ſhould be laid out in excellent claret.</p>
               <p>Charles had ſtayed ſo long in France that the time was now
nearly arrived which he had intended to have apportioned to his whole tour: for
his promiſe to his father had been to return in time to paſs his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day 
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:1185300302:310"/> with him, when he ſhould have attained his one and
twentieth year. He therefore determined to go back to England, in order to take
his affairs into his own hands, after which, if he ſhould feel himſelf ſo
diſpoſed, he might then be in time to make his tour of Italy; for ſo far
from having any body to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol him, he did not think there were ſix
perſons upon the face of the earth who cared three-pence about him. In this
mind he ſet out, with a view to ſtay a month at Paris, and then jog on
leiſurely for England. He arrived at Aix la Chapelle late in the evening,
where he ſupped, and then ordered poſt horſes to be ready the next
morning. The houſe ſeemed to be very full of gueſts, and juſt as our
hero got into bed, they were reinforced by a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from the play. Charles
had been dropt aſleep about an hour, when he was, all on a ſudden, awoke by
a violent ſcreaming. For a moment—which is very natural in a ſtrange
bed—he knew not where he was. Recollecting himſelf however, he hurried
on his breeches and ſlippers, and throwing a morning gown over him, took his
ſword, and darted from his own chamber to that from whence the noiſe
iſſued. The door was locked, but he burſt it open with his foot, and
immediately ſaw a French officer ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with a young lady, who ſtill
ſhrieked with all her force. With the hilt of his ſword he ſtruck the
raviſher in a moment to the ground, then placing <pb n="309" facs="tcp:1185300302:311"/>
himſelf between him and the young lady, he ſtood ready for him, in a
poſture of defence, againſt he ſhould attempt to riſe. At the moment he
placed himſelf in this attitude, rouſe reader your whole
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention!—exert your whole ſtock of penetration!—prepare for a
moſt unlooked-for ſurpriſe!—yet, let it be ever ſo great, it
cannot be any thing equal to that of our hero, when, on looking towards the
door, he ſaw ſeveral perſons enter the chamber, and, among the
foremoſt, Sir Sidney, Lady Roebuck, and Emma!</p>
               <p>Reader, it was Annette herſelf whom Charles had reſcued from
a raviſher!—who having in the fifteen months that he had been abſent
ripened into wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and improved in every limb and feature into more
perfection than ever was deſcribed by the ableſt pen or correcteſt
pencil; nay had the beſt poet or painter that ever wrote or drew ſeen her,
like our hero, at that moment, and even felt the ſame cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating
ſenſation from the aſtoniſhing power of her irreſiſtable charms,
then ſo greatly heightened, ſtill muſt a deſcription of them have been
incomplete: for neither are there words nor colours ſtrong enough for the
taſk. Charles, though he had but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was imperfectly lent him by
the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive intelligence received from ſeeing who entered the room, in that
moment gazed away his ſoul; <pb n="310" facs="tcp:1185300302:312"/> his very brain received
the whole force of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable attractions, and love took triumphant
poſſeſſion of him.</p>
               <p>During this interval, ſhort as it was, the officer had got up,
unſeen by our hero, and was coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. This conſtrained him to
transfer his attention from the lady to the gentleman. He aſked, in a firm
voice if he dared juſtify his conduct; to which he was anſwered, 
<q rend="inline">'No ſir; it was unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It was wine, it
was diſtraction! I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered an ignominious blow, but I deſerved it,
and you are a ſtranger. No ſir, I ſhall aſk for no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; for
light and blameable as I may have behaved, though my exiſtence depends on my
courage, and the ſword is my profeſſion, I dare not draw it in a
diſhonourable cauſe.'</q>
               </p>
               <p> Sir Sidney, who at firſt thought very differently of this
buſineſs, eſpecially when he heard Emma exclaim as they approached the
chamber, 
<q rend="inline">'Oh Chriſt, there is Mr. Hazard!'</q> felt,
from the ſtrongeſt conviction, a warm glow of gratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our hero.
This however was a little checked by reflection, as well as a contemplation of
what Charles was then doing, who, forgetting there were a number of
ſpectators preſent, ſtood like a ſtatue, devouring with his eyes the
beauty of Annette, <pb n="311" facs="tcp:1185300302:313"/> which was now heightened by
conſcious innocence and thankful pleaſure. In this ſhort interval,
dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which Sir Sidney deliberated, Annette was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly delighted, Emma
hugged herſelf, and our hero was faſcinated, in came to their relief Mr.
Gloſs, who being in a few words informed of the buſineſs, went up in a
ſtyle of the greateſt familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Charles, and ſeizing him by the
hand, cried out, 
<q rend="inline">'My dear ſir, how do you do? I thought you
were in Italy. For God's ſake why don't you let your friends hear from
you?'</q> Charles flung from him in great indignation, ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">'I don't know you ſir,'</q> and was making
towards the door, but Sir Sidney, who could not bear to receive a ſervice of
ſuch magnitude without noticing it, ſtopt him, ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">'I cannot refrain from warmly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
this unexpected kindneſs, which has been as bravely and gallantly, as
diſintereſtedly, ſhewn me. You know Mr. Hazard I have a warm heart, and a
generous action touches it; therefore, this of yours, which has probably
ſaved my honour, I ſhall not, you may be aſſured, think lightly of; and
if—'</q>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Surely,' ſaid Charles, recovering himſelf
into a complacent, yet erect dignity, 'you jeſt Sir Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney! What I have done
is at beſt but a common duty, which requires no partial thanks, becauſe 
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:1185300302:314"/> the greateſt ſtranger would have been equally
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to it. But how do you know it was not the act of one raviſher
anxious to defeat the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of another? I dare ſay it will have that
colour by to-morrow morning. In the mean time you ſhall be aſſured I am
honeſt in ſomething, nor will you doubt it when I tell you that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
motive induced me to that which has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Miſs Roebuck's honour to her
family, it was not friendſhip to her father: and ſo ſir, good night to
you.'</q> So ſaying, he bowed reſpectfully to the ladies, and left the
room.</p>
