            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ADVANTAGES
OF
<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Commerce.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>PEACE and Trade have ſo far got
the Start of War and the Sword,
that the <hi>Trading Nations</hi> of the
World are now become infinitely
ſuperior in Wealth and Power, to thoſe who
might properly be call'd the <hi>Fighting Nations,</hi>
and whoſe Grandure depended upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of their Dominions, and Number of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
Countries.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Superiority obtain'd by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
of their Government, the Prudence of
their Counſels, or the Valour of their Troops,
ſo much as by the <hi>Increaſe of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce:</hi>
This has enlarg'd their Wealth and
Power, attracted Multitudes to dwell in the
moſt narrow and preſcribed Bounds, and found
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0040200800:4"/>
Subſiſtence for them, where the Country it
ſelf could not maintain the tenth Part of
them: By this they have raiſed a Naval
Strength, which has made them terrible at
Sea, as well as formidable on Shore: By
this they have been able, on all Occaſions,
to carry the War home to their Enemies
Coaſts, however diſtant, and even in the
remoteſt Parts of the Globe: By this they
look into every Port, knock at every Door,
command Peace or War; and, in a word,
awe the World.</p>
            <p>All the formidable Fleets of <hi>England,
Holland, France, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Baltick,</hi>
what would they ſignify, if the reſpective
Countries to which they belong, could not
find able Seamen to man and manage them?
'Tis as they are or not able to do this, that
even thoſe Maritime Powers are more or
leſs potent at Sea; and this is all in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to their Trade. Their Seamen are
the Strength of their Fleet; and thoſe Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are nouriſh'd, increas'd, and in Time
of Peace employ'd, and thereby kept up to
their Number, only by Trade; nothing elſe
can do it.</p>
            <p>Abundance of uſeful Inferences might be
drawn from theſe Obſervations; but I wave
them for the preſent, to bring all down to
the Point I have now more immediately in
view, which is this: That whoever would
learn to know the World, and would go
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0040200800:5"/>
the beſt and readieſt Way to obtain a juſt
Idea of its preſent State, as well as of the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of the ſeveral Countries in it, has
nothing to do but to ſtudy Trade.</p>
            <p>Learn to underſtand the Commerce of
the World, and of courſe you are led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its Geography, or the Deſcription of its
Situation: By this means you will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
drawn into a Knowledge of the
Diſtances of one Country from another, of
their Poſition on the Globe, and how they
ſtand with reſpect to one another: By in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
which way their Commerce is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on, you neceſſarily come to know,
whether they are inland Countries, or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
on the Sea; whether Iſlands, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
to one another and to the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;
whether to be travell'd to and traded
with by Land or by Water, or perhaps by
both.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Situation of Nations only
known by the Study of Trade; but by this
Means alſo their ſeveral Intereſts are judg'd
of, as alſo their Ability to ſupport one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
and themſelves, which way their
Strength lies, and how it exerts it ſelf,
whether by Land or Sea: And all their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable
Rivers and trading Ports are known
by the Navigation which is employ'd between
them, and the Trade which is carried on in
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0040200800:6"/>
The Number of the People, the Wealth,
and conſequently the Strength of Nations,
are all learnt by the ſame Study. By this
you ſee the Richneſs of their Product, the
Bulk of their Exportations, and Number of
Ships employ'd in their Trade. Even the
Diligence and Application of their People
is judg'd of by the Quantity and Goodneſs
of their Manufactures, and the Produce of
their Country appearing in Trade.</p>
            <p>To know Trade then is to know the
World: And I may farther obſerve, That
if any one Nation could govern Trade, that
Nation would govern the World; could it
give Laws to the Commerce, it would give
Laws to the People, and the whole World
would be its Dependents and Subjects.</p>
            <p>Not ſo much the Hiſtories of paſt Times,
as the many Examples of the preſent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this. The Trading Nations are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the moſt formidable at this time; and that
they are ſo in conſequence of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
in Trade, may appear, in that all
thoſe Nations, which were formerly great
in Trade, but ſince declin'd, are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
declin'd in their Strength as their
Trade has fallen off. The City of <hi>Antwerp</hi>
is a noted Inſtance of this, as are almoſt
all the <hi>Hans Towns</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> alſo <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Decay, with the Cauſes of it, in the
<hi>Atlas Maritimus,</hi> lately publiſh'd, which in
almoſt every Part of it confirms this Maxim
by Examples in the moſt conſiderable Cities
and States in the World.</p>
            <p>The late <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. (more
juſtly on that account call'd <hi>Great,</hi> than for
the Glory of his Arms) ſaw plainly that
the Way to make the <hi>French</hi> Nation the
Terror of the World, was not ſo much by
the Succeſs of his Arms, and his Conqueſts
upon his Neighbours, as by encouraging
the Commerce of his own Country, and
employing the vaſt Numbers of People,
which his Dominions were every where full
of, and which he found out of Buſineſs and
ſtarving, in the ſeveral Branches of Trade,
as Arts, Manufactures, Navigation, Fiſhing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
by which means the Poor were every where
ſet to work, if not made to work, and of
Conſequence fed and cloth'd; almoſt every
Province being put in a Capacity to feed and
employ their own Hands: and the Effects of
this are, to this Day, very viſible and plain
in the following Inſtances.<list>
                  <item>1. His <hi>Tallie</hi> (which is a Tax upon all
the Families of the <hi>Plebeii,</hi> or meaner
trading People only) is viſibly increas'd,
and raiſes now ſome Millions more than it
uſually did.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0040200800:8"/>
2. His Subjects, eſpecially in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing
and trading Towns, grew rich;
and had he not been oblig'd by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of the War to oppreſs them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with heavy and almoſt inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Taxes, by which the publick Credit
ſunk, and grew precarious, and the Bank
of <hi>Lyons</hi> in particular was ruin'd and fail'd,
and the Coin debas'd almoſt to nothing, ſo
that their Crown was not worth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>Livre</hi> in exchange: I ſay, had not
theſe things follow'd by the Diſtreſſes of
the War, the common trading People of
<hi>France</hi> had been rich; and 'tis evident
that they grow rich apace ſince the War,
by the meer Increaſe of their Manufactures
at home.</item>
                  <item>3. In a farther Purſuit of the ſame Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims,
the King turn'd his Eye to the Sea,
and took proper Meaſures for the Increaſe
of Shipping, the Encouragement of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
the ſetting up Companies, Fiſheries,
and the like, that his Subjects might be
employ'd as well by Water as by Land,
and that he might be able to man and fit
out his Ships of War with able Seamen of
his own; which the <hi>French</hi> have ſince
done, but were never able to do before.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Encouragement this gave to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and their Opulence by Sea, evidently
appear'd, even to the Terror of <hi>Europe,</hi> in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0040200800:9"/>
the mighty Fleets which he fitted out in a few
Years after he began thoſe Regulations; Fleets
ſuperior even to the united Naval Powers
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland:</hi> Nor had this Naval
Power of <hi>France</hi> been broken, had it not
been for the meer Arrogance of the King
himſelf, who in a miſtaken Confidence of his
own Power, poſitively order'd Monſ. <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
his Admiral, to fight the Confederate
Fleet, (not thinking they were join'd, and)
whether they were join'd or no; by which
means he was overthrown, and ſome of the
fineſt Ships in the World ſet on fire in their
own Ports, and ſome even by their own
Hands; a Loſs they never recover'd: But
this by the way. The fitting out ſuch a
Fleet as the <hi>French</hi> had in the Action at
<hi>Beachy,</hi> in the Year 1690, is fully to the
Point in Hand, where they had 90 Men of
War of the Line, from 55 Guns and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
among which were no leſs than 17
three-Deck Ships, and as I have been told,
above 50000 Men, whereof 32000 were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Seamen of their own. All theſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the <hi>French</hi> King's Dominions, by
means of Trade, are at large deſcrib'd in
the foremention'd Book, to which I refer
the Curious.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Effects of Trade, where the
Increaſe and Cultivation of it are made the
Care of the Publick. The States of <hi>Holland</hi>
are another Inſtance hereof, whoſe formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0040200800:10"/>
Power has increas'd with their Trade,
and by the Aſſiſtance of that only; as on
the other hand, the Decay of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Power (which in the Time of <hi>Philip</hi> II.
was a Terror to the whole World, and was
rais'd on the meer Increaſe of their Trade)
has apparently been occaſion'd by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of their Trade, out of which they were
every where driven by the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole World, as well Pagan as
Chriſtian, is full of Examples of this kind:
But to give one for all the reſt; a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
between the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Provinces of
<hi>Aſia</hi> (ſuch as we call the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> and
<hi>China</hi>) and the whole Country of <hi>Africa,</hi>
will confirm this Obſervation beyond all
Contradiction.</p>
            <p>We ſee the whole Quarter of the World
call'd <hi>Africa,</hi> large to an Extreme, ſuited by
its Climate and Situation for all manner of
Improvements, as well by Cultivation as
Commerce; populous (at leaſt on the Sea
Coaſts) equally almoſt to any other Part,
and in ſome Places more populous than moſt
other Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>Their Ports, Harbours, Rivers and Bays,
were they frequented, and the ſafe Roads
fully deſcribed, are more in number than in
moſt other Countries; and their prodigious
Length of Coaſt cannot but render this Part
of the World admirably ſituated for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of Commerce: For the whole
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0040200800:11"/>
Country call'd <hi>Africa</hi> is an Iſland, except
the ſmall Iſthmus or Neck of Land from
<hi>Suez</hi> on the <hi>Red Sea</hi> to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which
is not above 60 Miles. Nay, ſo well fitted
for Trade is <hi>Africa,</hi> that a late Author tells,
us, there are more and greater Rivers in it,
and more adapted to Commerce, and to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Navigation, than in all the Country of
<hi>America;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Carolina</hi>
only excepted.</p>
            <p>But in the midſt of all theſe Advantages,
thro' the Indolence and Ignorance of the
Natives on one hand, and the barbarous
Tyranny of the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> on the
other, (the <hi>European</hi> Nations having planted
but few Colonies on her Continent) we ſee
this whole Country in a manner left deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
no Improvement, no ſettled Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but vaſt Extents of Land neglected,
whole Provinces left wild, and like a <hi>Terra
deſerta,</hi> remaining in a meer State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
And all for want of Trade.</p>
            <p>The Soil is in many Places very rich,
and the Product of Nature exceeds all the
reſt of the known World. The North Coaſt,
for almoſt 2000 Miles, commonly call'd the
Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> produces the fineſt Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and in great Quantities: All the Fruits
that the South Coaſt of <hi>Spain</hi> is ſo famous
for, are produced here in the greateſt Plenty
and perfection; ſuch as Raiſins, Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
Lemons, Oranges, Almonds; and to
ſum up all, ſuch a prodigious Quantity of the

beſt Wheat<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Capt,</hi> Braithwaite'<hi>s late Hiſtory of the Revolutions in</hi> Morocco.</note>, that were it not inhabited by

            <p>The Weſt Coaſt produces Honey, Wax,

theſe, Gold and Elephants Teeth in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
The Eaſt Coaſt produces Gold and
Teeth alſo, and Black Cattle without Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and going North from the Coaſt of
<hi>Zanguebar</hi> up to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> it furniſhes
<hi>Arabia</hi> with the fineſt and beſt Breed of
Horſes. And beſides all this, were not the
Weſt Shore of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> poſſeſs'd by the
<hi>Turks,</hi> who will ſuffer no free Trade with
<hi>Aethiopia,</hi> it is not to be expreſs'd what a
Scene of Wealth and Commerce would open
it ſelf there.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Africa</hi> is not only thus rich in its
actual Produce, but the Soil is of ſuch a
Nature as to be capable of vaſt Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
were it duly cultivated and manag'd.
The Author of the <hi>Atlas</hi> aſſures us, that
the Sugars of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> as
alſo Cotton, Ginger, Indico and Cocoa, have
all been try'd there, and thrive to a Wonder:
And other Authors, as well <hi>Engliſh</hi> as <hi>Dutch,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0040200800:13"/>
concur with him, and tell us that Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have been made of the Coffee of
<hi>Mocha,</hi> the Tea of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> &amp;c.
and we are told there are Plants of both
now in the <hi>Africa</hi> Company's Garden at
<hi>Cape-Coaſt Caſtle:</hi> And indeed why ſhould
thoſe valuable Productions fail in <hi>Africa,</hi>
when planted in the very ſame Climate in
which they grow to ſuch Perfection in
<hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>China?</hi> But for a farther Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and indeed a very particular one, of
the probable 'Improvements that might be
made in this Part of the World, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to the Book before mention'd; it not
being poſſible to treat particularly of theſe
things in the Compaſs of ſo ſhort a Piece as
this is.</p>
            <p>What we have now to obſerve, and which
is to our preſent Purpoſe, is; That with
all this Wealth in Nature, and all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
which might be added by the
help of Induſtry and Art, there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
worth naming in <hi>Africa.</hi> The Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
People deſpiſing Trade, live by Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
being almoſt all Corſairs and Pirates;
ſuch as the <hi>Algerines, Tuniſeens</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polins,</hi>
together with the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Sallee</hi>
and <hi>Alfarache</hi> on the North-weſt Shore.
The other Weſtern Coaſts have ſo little Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
for the many Millions that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
it, (I mean from the <hi>Rio Grande</hi> or <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
North, to the <hi>Congo,</hi> South) that for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0040200800:14"/>
want of Produce they ſell one another, and
the People are carried away by Thouſands,
Men, Women and Children, to the Number,
as ſome think, of 300000 in a Year, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and work for the more diligent <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi>
in <hi>America.</hi> Here is a flagrant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Weakneſs and Deficiency of a
Country for want of Trade, in ſpite of all
the Bounty of Nature, and of the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
Capacity for the beſt Trade in the
World.</p>
            <p>I might enlarge here upon the Situation
of <hi>Africa</hi> for Improvement and Commerce,
as, its lying between all the Trading Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the World, and its Nearneſs to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
which is the Market for all its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions;
alſo how it might be encourag'd to
build, and employ Ships, and might raiſe a
ſufficient Fund of Goods for the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Shipping, as well as Gold to pay
them. But all this is fully done in the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
which gives a diſtinct Account of the
Commerce, both as it now is, and as it is
capable of being increas'd; and ſhews how
much ſuperior <hi>Africa</hi> would be to <hi>America,</hi>
or even to <hi>India</hi> it ſelf, if it was encourag'd
by ſettled Colonies, as the former, or inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by a trading manufacturing People, as
the latter. I cannot therefore leave this
Particular, without recommending it to the
Age to ſtudy the enlarging of Commerce,
the encouraging of Induſtry, the planting
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0040200800:15"/>
of deſolate Countries, and the employing
thoſe indolent Nations, who tho they may
be ſaid to be idle, yet 'tis not ſo much for
want of Will to work, as for want of ſome
to employ them, and inſtruct them what to
do.</p>
            <p>I have now done with one Branch of
the Compariſon, <hi>viz.</hi> the State of <hi>Africa,</hi>
with reſpect to Trade: Let us next look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Extreme the other Way, I mean in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> that is to ſay, the Countries of
<hi>Malabar, India Proper, Ceylon, Coromandel,
Bengal, Siam, Pegu, Cochin-China,</hi> with <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
it ſelf, and <hi>Japan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be ſaid but that the Natives of
ſome if not moſt of theſe Countries, are
(or were originally) as ignorant and ſtupid
as the <hi>Negroes</hi> of <hi>Africa;</hi> excepting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the People of <hi>China,</hi> and even in
<hi>Africa</hi> the People of <hi>Aethiopia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Indians</hi> are enur'd to Trade, and
have a natural Genius to Induſtry and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;
and ſo they fall upon Labour,
whilſt the <hi>Africans</hi> are indolent; and ſpread
their Manufactures, the Work of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
over the whole World, whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſell not the Work of the People but
the People themſelves.</p>
            <p>And what is the Conſequence of all this,
but that theſe Nations of <hi>India</hi> are rich,
populous and powerful? Nay, the <hi>Mogul,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0040200800:16"/>
who is call'd the moſt powerful Emperor
of <hi>India,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Tartar,</hi> who is
the like in <hi>China,</hi> are made ſo rich and
ſtrong, meerly by the immenſe Wealth ariſing
from their Trade.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chineſe</hi> have not any Sea Coaſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
along the Eaſtern Shore of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and yet they ſpread the Sea with their
Ships, and have ſuch an infinite Number, that
one who deſcribes that Country, ſaid he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
they had Ships enough to make a
Bridge from thence into <hi>France.</hi> It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
he would not be taken literally; but
we may venture to conclude from thence,
that he found there an infinite Number of
Veſſels of all kinds.</p>
            <p>The Power and Riches of <hi>China</hi> are well
worth a large Deſcription; as alſo the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Cities, of which ſome are ſo great
as to contain, by Report, 5 or 6,000000
of People; and the Provinces, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
remote from the Sea, or from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City, are full of conſiderable Towns,
large Villages, ſcattered Hamlets and Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and all ſurprizingly full of People.</p>
            <p>If we inquire into the Reaſon of this, we
ſhall find it all owing to Trade, and the
mighty Commerce they carry on as well by
Land as by Sea. We ſee the Produce of
their Land is coveted by all the <hi>Europeans,</hi>
and by us in particular; witneſs, eſpecially,
their Tea, their <hi>China</hi> Ware, and ſeveral of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0040200800:17"/>
their Drugs and other Growth of their Soil:
And as for their Manufactures, they were not
only brought hither in vaſt Quantities, but
they became, as it were, the Terror of <hi>Europe</hi>
in Trade, and of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
ſo that we were oblig'd to make Laws to
keep them out, and to prohibit the Uſe and
Wearing of them; otherwiſe they would ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
and deſtroy our own Manufacture.</p>
            <p>How theſe populous Countries purſue their
Commerce, and eſpecially their Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
with an indefatigable Application, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from the immenſe Quantity of Goods
they would import upon us, if they were
not prohibited; and the Author of the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
has prov'd, that the People of <hi>India</hi> and
<hi>China</hi> are able to clothe the whole World
with their Manufactures; and that they
trade with <hi>Europe</hi> infinitely to its Loſs,
and to their own Gain, for that in effect
all the ready Money of the other three
Parts of the World, all the Gold and Silver of
<hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> would be hardly able to
ſerve for Returns: all which he makes out
very clearly, even to the meaneſt Capacity.</p>
            <p>Hence we ſee the Juſtice of the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions
in <hi>England,</hi> and alſo in <hi>France;</hi>
I mean the prohibiting the Uſe and Wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of theſe foreign Manufactures: For if
Commerce be the Life and Soul of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's
Proſperity, if we are more or leſs
rich and powerful as our Trade is more or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0040200800:18"/>
leſs flouriſhing; it muſt be underſtood of
ſuch Trade only as we gain by, not of
pernicious Trading, and which we cannot
carry on but to our Loſs. And this may
occaſion ſome unuſual Speculations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great Strife we find among the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi>
Powers, about who ſhall or ſhall not
carry on this Trade to <hi>India:</hi> For if it be
true, that <hi>Europe</hi> in general loſes by it,
and that it exhauſts the Treaſure of all our
Trading Countries, returning nothing but its
own Produce and its own Manufactures,
and receiving little from us but our Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Coin, which is the Eſſence of our
Produce (I mean by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s here the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>)
I ſay, if this be true, it would be
the undoubted Intereſt of all <hi>Europe</hi> to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
that Commerce, except what is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary for the ſupply of <hi>Europe</hi>'s
Wants, that is to ſay, things that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without; ſuch as Salt-petre, Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
Spices, needful Drugs and Dye-ſtuffs,
and the like; all which are the natural
Product or Growth of the Country; and
not to meddle with any of their Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which indeed are the things that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
the Commerce of <hi>Europe,</hi> and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh
the People.</p>
            <p>As to the Coffee and Tea, which are the
two great Articles ſo much in Demand,
'tis ſufficient to obſerve, that we might
tranſplant thoſe Vegetables, and many more,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0040200800:19"/>
from <hi>Arabia, India</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> into <hi>Africa;</hi>
and with a very little Application might
raiſe them all, and in ſufficient Quantities,
in our own Factories on the Coaſt of
<hi>Guinea.</hi> This the <hi>Dutch</hi> have begun with
ſucceſs in relation to the Coffee, which
they have raiſed already in ſo great a
Quantity at <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>avia,</hi> that they ſetch very
little now from <hi>Mocha:</hi> And we are told
alſo, that they have made another Attempt
for planting Coffee at <hi>Surinam</hi> on the
Coaſt of <hi>Nova Audaluſia</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> where
it alſo thrives very well. But this is a
Digreſſion from the preſent Purpoſe; and
for a farther Inquiry into theſe things, I
refer the Reader to the foremention'd <hi>Atlas,</hi>
where he will ſee them explain'd and treated
on at large.</p>
            <p>However, I cannot quit this Diſcourſe of
the <hi>India</hi> Trade, without hinting as I go,
that I think, while this Part of <hi>Europe</hi> is
ſo buſily engag'd, even almoſt to a War,
for preventing Encroachments upon this
Trade, it is very ſtrange they ſhould entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neglect a Back-Door by which all the
moſt hurtful Part of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade
is like (and very quickly too) to break in
upon them like a Flood, and that with a
Force which they will not find it eaſy to
reſiſt; I mean by the Way of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and
that as well by Caravans over Land from
<hi>China,</hi> as by Water, that is to ſay, by a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0040200800:20"/>
River Navigation from the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s
Dominions, which is more properly and
particularly call'd <hi>Eaſt-India:</hi> Which I ſhall
have occaſion to mention again by and by.</p>
            <p>Let me now ſpeak a little of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and Advantage of <hi>Peace,</hi> in relation
to <hi>Trade;</hi> as I join'd them together at
firſt.</p>
            <p>Peace is certainly the Right Hand of
Trade; it is its Support and Defence: It
is by Peace alone that the flouriſhing and
proſperous State of Trade is preſerv'd, if
not procur'd. The Hiſtory of our Trade
in <hi>England</hi> would abundantly confirm this.
The firſt Introduction of our Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
was under the peaceable Reign
of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. During thoſe twenty Years,
it took its firſt and deepeſt Root. The
next Reign was not ſo quiet: The Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of Monaſteries at home, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities
about the Queens, and the Wars
in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> embaraſs'd the
Court and the Clergy; but the common
People were generally kept out of the
Quarrel, and their Trade ſtill took root at
home.</p>
            <p>Perſecution indeed in the latter End of
King <hi>Henvy</hi> VIII's Reign, and thro' the
whole Reign of his Daughter Queen <hi>Mary;</hi>
nay even during the Reformation in <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
VI's Reign, take them all together,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0040200800:21"/>
haraſs'd the People, and extremely interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Commerce. In one Reign one ſort of
People were uneaſy, in the next another,
in the third another: Alternately, one Side
and the other fled from their Dwellings,
ſecur'd their Effects, and hid themſelves for
their Lives. In one Reign one Side rebell'd,
and in another Reign another: In king
<hi>Edward</hi> VI's Reign the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and the
<hi>Devonſhire</hi> People rebelled for the Maſs;
in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Time Sir <hi>Thomas Wyatt</hi>
and the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Men rebelled for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
And by all theſe things Trade
was interrupted.</p>
            <p>When Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown,
Trade flouriſh'd in ſuch a manner as ſurpriz'd
the World; becauſe the Glory of her Arms
gave her an Advantage to ſpread it abroad,
as we may ſay, to all Nations; and the
Root it had taken in the Times of Peace,
under the two <hi>Henrys,</hi> had given the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
a Strength of Stock to extend it into
the remoteſt Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>The Queen, whatever Part ſhe bore in
the Wars abroad, always kept her Subjects
in Peace at home; the Intervals occaſion'd
by the Inſurrection of the Earl of <hi>Weſtmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and others, were not worth naming.
This Peace at home, and the Support and
Aſſiſtance the Queen gave to her Merchants
abroad, laid the Foundation of the moſt
flouriſhing Branches of our Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0040200800:22"/>
               <hi>Turkey, Hamborough,</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
and eſpecially the planting Colonies
abroad, particularly in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whoever conſults the above-mention'd
Author, will find, that the Diſcovery and
peopling of all our moſt conſiderable Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
in <hi>America,</hi> were perform'd in her
Reign; and will ſee from what ſmall Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
thoſe flouriſhing Plantations have been
raiſed to their preſent Greatneſs, the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Poſſeſſion being preſerv'd by the powerful
Influence of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If War at any time interrupted them, as
the Wars they had with the Natives often
did, their Trade was greatly leſſen'd, the
Plantations ſpoil'd, and the whole very
much endanger'd; as has been the Caſe of
<hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>New England</hi> more than
once.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Queen's Reign the firſt Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
were made to the Gold Coaſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi>
which we now call <hi>Guinea;</hi> and all
was ſupported by the Purſes of her Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and trading People, grown rich by
the ſucceſs of Trade in the peaceable Reigns
of her Predeceſſors: So that in her Reign
it might be ſaid to arrive to its firſt Glory,
and even to its Meridian Height, counting
one Hundred Years from its Beginning.</p>
            <p>It may be true, that the great Succeſs of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in her Maritime Affairs,
and the Terror of her Name, gave a vaſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0040200800:23"/>
Addition to the Glory of her Reign: But
it was her prodigious Extending and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
the Commerce of her Subjects,
that gave Stability of Greatneſs and Power
to the whole Kingdom; and it was upon
the foot of the Greatneſs of her Trade, that
the Nation became formidable over the whole
World.</p>
            <p>Witneſs for this, the Regard ſhewn to
her Embaſſies (which, by the way, conſiſted
of Merchants) chiefly at the Courts of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,
Iſpahan</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Moſcow;</hi>
in all which her Merchants were admitted,
and her Letters in their behalf receiv'd with
the greateſt Reſpect, tho no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſter
of State or Envoy had ever been ſeen, or
perhaps heard of, in any of thoſe Courts
before.</p>
            <p>From hence to this very Day, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of <hi>Great Britain</hi> has been the Glory
of our Country, as it is the Fund of our
Power. Kings and Princes may declare War,
and lead Armies, and Victory ſometimes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the fortunate Inferior: But generally
ſpeaking, the longeſt Purſe, not the longeſt
Sword, gets the Day in the End; and as
nothing can furniſh Money like Commerce,
ſo the Trading Countries have manifeſtly the
Advantage in a War.</p>
            <p>This indeed is a good Reaſon why <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
of all other Nations, ſhould be the
leaſt afraid of a War: And yet at the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0040200800:24"/>
ſame time let me hint to our Countrymen
who are ſo forward for Fighting, That we
are likely always to ſuffer the greateſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages
in caſe of a War; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is plain, becauſe of our infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Ships, and Merchants, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Effects, which are abroad in every
Corner of the World: No Nation has ſo
much to loſe, and no Nation can ſuffer ſo
great Loſs in caſe of a War.</p>
            <p>Therefore I cannot but pay a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the Endeavours of thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
who, notwithſtanding the Murmurs of
the People, apply themſelves to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> and preventing a
War. War to a Trading Nation is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Death; it is a ſtrong Paralytick, it
ſtagnates the Blood; and, in a word, is
fatal, if not to the Trade it ſelf in general,
yet to the Proſperity and Health of it.
And tho our Trade, being the greateſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Diſpute in the World, is therefore beſt
able to ſupport us in a War; yet our Trade
too would ſuffer moſt by a War, even
for this very Reaſon, becauſe it is the
greateſt.</p>
            <p>But to look a little abroad again: Other
Nations are viſibly increas'd in Power by
the Help of their Commerce, as well as
<hi>England;</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> are the next Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0040200800:25"/>
The Author of the <hi>Atlas</hi> gives a diſtinct
View of the prodigious Trade they carry
on. He touches upon their ſmall Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and ſhews how they were elevated,
meerly by their Commerce, from the <hi>Poor
and Diſtreſſed States,</hi> the Style in which
they addreſſed Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for Aid
againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to that of the <hi>High
and Mighty Lords the States General,</hi> the
Style in which they now treat both with their
Allies and Enemies.</p>
            <p>He deſcribes their foreign Trade, their
Fiſheries, and their <hi>Greenland</hi> Trade in an
eſpecial manner, of which there is indeed
a ſurprizing Account: He gives the Hiſtory
of their firſt Adventures to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
and their Progreſs and Conqueſt there over
the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Settlements: He ſhews the
Glory and Grandeur of their City of <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via;</hi>
and indeed that very Place is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Proof of what I have advanced, the
formidable Power of that City, and of all the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Settlements in the <hi>Indies,</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
raiſed by Commerce, without the leaſt
Aſſiſtance from the Government or the publick
Stock in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He gives an Account likewiſe of all their
Inland Trade, the greateſt perhaps of its kind
in the World; a Trade wholly carry'd on by
River Navigation, by the Help of Boats,
Hoys, Bylanders, and ſuch Veſſels, upon
the great Rivers of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> the <hi>Maes,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0040200800:26"/>
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Ems</hi> and the <hi>Weſer;</hi> and
from thoſe Rivers again by the <hi>Lys,</hi> the
<hi>Scarp</hi> and <hi>Sambre,</hi> the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> the <hi>Saar,</hi>
the <hi>Maine,</hi> the <hi>Neckar,</hi> and abundance of
other navigable Streams, into the very Heart
of <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and the <hi>Auſtrian Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
and quite up into <hi>Switzerland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis to be obſerv'd here likewiſe, that
nothing but Peace could raiſe ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
to a People diſtreſs'd, as they were
before, by all the Extremities of War, to
ſuch a Degree, that we have been told,
they were once upon the Point of reſolving
to ſhip themſelves all off, Poor and Rich,
to quit their Country to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
and go away to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> But the
War ending, firſt in a Truce of twelve Years,
and after that in a perpetual Peace, how
ſoon did the Caſe alter with them! Peace
raiſed Trade, their Trade raiſed their Wealth,
and their Wealth raiſed their Power; in which
their Fleets are ſo formidable that, <hi>England</hi>
only excepted, they are able to fight all the
other Maritime Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> I had
almoſt ſaid if they were join'd together.
Here is indeed an undoubted Teſtimony to
my firſt Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Trading
Nations are the moſt powerful Nations.</p>
            <p>I might run thro' the particular Caſes of all
the Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> but I ſhall only add
the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> or <hi>Ruſſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0040200800:27"/>
How feeble this vaſtly extended Empire
was about thirty Years ago, I need not ſay.
They had not one Port in all the Trading
Seas of the World, by which they could
correſpond with any Part of <hi>Europe, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel</hi>
on the frozen Northern Coaſt only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>For
want of this, of what Conſideration
were they in the Account of <hi>Europe</hi>'s
Strength? How little did they weigh in
the Balance of Power? And they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
in the ſeveral Courts of <hi>Europe</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly;
ſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> told them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome Occaſion, that they neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
how to make War or Peace. Thus
contemptible were they, tho at the ſame
time the <hi>Czar</hi> had a Country under his
Dominion as big as all the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi>
And the Reaſon of all this low Figure they
made, was evidently this, and nothing
elſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That they had no Trade, no
Commerce or Correſpondence with the reſt
of the World.</p>
            <p>Obſerve now the Difference: When the
late Czar <hi>Peter</hi> came to the Government,
and by his Prudence and Politicks ally'd
himſelf with the Trading Countries of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
beginning to teach his People the
Arts of Navigation and Commerce; as ſoon
as he did this, he got Money, rais'd Troops,
ſhew'd the World that his Men might be
taught to fight as well as other Nations,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0040200800:28"/>
and ſoon brought them to do ſo. As ſoon
as the Proſperity of Trade made them feel
ſomething of the Advantages accruing by
it, we find him puſhing himſelf upon the
<hi>Swedes,</hi> gaining from them the Maritime
Provinces they poſſeſs'd in the <hi>Baltick;</hi>
and as he open'd the Seas for his People
to trade, they ſoon enabled him to ſpread
thoſe Seas with his Men of War, ſo that
he became an Over-match either for the
<hi>Dane</hi> or the <hi>Swede;</hi> and had he lived a
few Years longer, he would have begun to
appear formidable in the Ocean as well as he
had done in the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen the Succeſſors of this Prince,
however unactive in other Matters, extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diligent in this of Trade. The preſent
<hi>Czar</hi> is now eſtabliſhing the Commerce of
his Subjects to all Parts of the World, and
his Eaſtern Commerce in particular in a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
manner, as well with <hi>China</hi> as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,
Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Turkey.</hi> This he does
partly by a Communication of Rivers, and
partly by the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and alſo by Land.
And this brings me back to what I mention'd
before, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Trade with the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi>
was likely to break in upon <hi>Europe</hi>
this Way, in a Manner too powerful to be
reſiſted, and in a Way more fatal than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Emperor's late Company erected at
<hi>Oſtend,</hi> or any other Rivals whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0040200800:29"/>
It is but a few Days ago, that Letters
from <hi>Petersburg</hi> brought an Account of
the Return of Monſ. <hi>Winderowitz,</hi> the
<hi>Ruſſian</hi> Embaſſador to the Emperor of <hi>China,</hi>
and of the Succeſs of his Embaſſy at that
Court: How he had ſettled the Limits of
the two Empires, which had in vain been
attempted for above ſixty Years before; and
withal had made a particular Treaty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
by which a free Trade is eſtabliſh'd
between the two Empires, and all the Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances,
Scruples, and troubleſom Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which obſtructed it, and in particular
the Tolls, Preſents, and other Demands made
by the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Officers at the paſſing the
great Wall of <hi>China,</hi> are taken off; and all
other Tolls and Payments, Preſents or Fees
taken at the Entrance into any City or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
which were before uncertain and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,
are all remov'd, and turn'd into one
general Duty or Cuſtom of Import and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
as in other Countries; and this Duty
or Cuſtom to be unalterable, except on due
Notice given on both Sides.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, they have ſettled the placing
of Guards in proper Places, and the building
of Caravanſeras or fortify'd Inns upon the
Road, for the Reception of Merchants and
their Goods; and the Governours of every
Province are to be made anſwerable for any
Robberies committed by the <hi>Tartars</hi> or any
other Rovers within their Bounds; due Notice
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0040200800:30"/>
being always given of the Approach of ſuch
Merchants or their Caravans.</p>
            <p>By this means they aſſure us, that the
Trade between <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia</hi> will be as
ſafe and eaſy as it is or can be in <hi>Europe</hi>
between one Province and another; and
that the Caravans ſhall go and come with
ſuch Freedom, that there ſhall arrive in
<hi>Ruſſia</hi> at leaſt one great Caravan, conſiſting
of four, five, or ſix Hundred Camels, a
Month; and ſometimes three or four ſuch in
a Month.</p>
            <p>It would be worth while to deſcribe here
the Manner of the March of theſe Caravans,
how they are furniſh'd with Proviſions in
ſuch great Deſarts as they are oblig'd to paſs
over; what Hazards they run from the
Robbers and <hi>Tartars</hi> upon the way, and the
like: As alſo to deſcribe the Way it ſelf,
and what vaſt Circuits they take for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of coming to inhabited Countries
and navigable Rivers, eſpecially the great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Janizea</hi> and <hi>Oby,</hi> the River <hi>Irtisk,</hi> and at
laſt the <hi>Dwina;</hi> by which they are brought
up to <hi>Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>gda,</hi> from whence they have
but a ſhort Paſſage to the Lakes <hi>Onega</hi> and
<hi>Ladoga,</hi> by which they come to <hi>Petersburg.</hi>
But as this would be too tedious for the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Compaſs of this Work, ſo it is not ſo
directly to my preſent Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>To return therefore to the Point which
is more immediately before me: We are told,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0040200800:31"/>
that theſe Meaſures being enter'd into by the
Government of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> the Trade is to be
carry'd on by a Company to be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and to be furniſh'd with all needful
royal Privileges, and Aſſurances of Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of a conſtant Care of their Intereſts at
the Emperor of <hi>China</hi>'s Court by the <hi>Ruſſian</hi>
Emperor: And we are alſo told, that the
Merchants of <hi>Lubec</hi> are, or are to be, very
far intereſted in the ſaid Company.</p>
            <p>The Goods to be imported this Way from
<hi>China,</hi> are (to be ſure) all the fineſt and moſt
portable; ſuch as wrought and raw Silks,
the former in the known Variety in which
we uſually imported them from thence; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
Gold in Specie, Drugs of various kinds,
and Tea. Whether any of the Goods uſually
brought from the Bay of <hi>Bengal,</hi> and other
Parts of <hi>India,</hi> may find their Way by this
Rout, we cannot determine. But if this
Trade ſhould now be open'd as above, and
all theſe Goods be brought upon ſuch eaſy
Terms of Carriage as they aſſure us ſhall be
done, and we ſhould ſee them publickly put
up in open ſale at <hi>Petersburg,</hi> and perhaps
at <hi>Lubec;</hi> it naturally leads me to ask, to
what Purpoſe is all this Streſs laid upon the
erecting an <hi>Oſtend</hi> Company? Certainly the
opening a Trade to <hi>India</hi> in general is the
main thing to be conſider'd; not whether
it ſhall be done by one Nation or another,
one Prince or another: For a Sale of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0040200800:32"/>
and <hi>China</hi> Goods at <hi>Lubec</hi> or at
<hi>Oſtend,</hi> at <hi>Petersburg</hi> in the Gulph of <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or at <hi>Trieſte</hi> in the Gulph of <hi>Venice,</hi>
is much the ſame thing to the Commerce of
<hi>Europe.</hi> Unleſs therefore ſome Check can
be put to the erecting ſuch a Company as this,
(and that I do not ſee is any way practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable)
the ſuppreſſing that at <hi>Oſtend</hi> does
not, in my Opinion, ſeem to promiſe much
to the Commerce. But to go on with the
<hi>Muſcovite</hi> Company:</p>
            <p>Beſides this Back-Door Trade (for ſo it
may be juſtly call'd) to <hi>China,</hi> the late Czar
had laid a Scheme for another; and I muſt
acknowledge it ſeems very practicable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Situation of the Country,
and the Sources and Courſes of the Rivers
<hi>Indus, Ganges,</hi> and <hi>Oxus;</hi> as they are laid
down in the ſaid <hi>Atlas Maritimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Trade, according to the Czar's Deſign,
was thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That by a ſhort Paſſage over
Land from the <hi>Ganges</hi> and the <hi>Indus,</hi> the one
running into the Bay of <hi>Bengal</hi> by the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of <hi>Hugeley</hi> and <hi>Calcuta,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
running into the <hi>Indian</hi> Ocean not far
from <hi>Suratte,</hi> and between that and the
Gulph of <hi>Perſia:</hi> I ſay, the Czar's Deſign
was, that Caravans ſhould be appointed from
both thoſe great Rivers to the River <hi>Oxus,</hi>
(the Diſtance from either of them being not
above 120 to 140 Miles) and all the rich
Goods of either Coaſt of <hi>India,</hi> viz. of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0040200800:33"/>
Coaſt of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Malabar,</hi> by the <hi>Indus,</hi>
and of the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel</hi> and <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda,</hi>
by the <hi>Ganges,</hi> ſhould be brought
into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea; from thence by Ship
to <hi>Aſtracan</hi> on the <hi>Wolga;</hi> and from <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracan,</hi>
by the <hi>Wolga,</hi> and by the new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
which the Czar begun, into the Lake
<hi>Ladoga,</hi> and then by the <hi>Neva</hi> to <hi>Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi>
So that all this Trade would be
carry'd on by Water from the remoteſt Parts
of <hi>India,</hi> except about 120 to 140 Miles,
as above.</p>
            <p>I need not enumerate all the ſeveral ſorts
of Goods which would come into <hi>Europe</hi>
by this Paſſage; it is enough to ſay, that
they would leave us under no Neceſſity to
bring any thing about by long Sea, except
the heavy and bulky Goods. As for Spices,
we ſee them even already ſold at <hi>Moſcow</hi>
cheaper than we can buy them here; and
the like of the raw Silk of <hi>Georgia</hi> and
<hi>Guylan,</hi> which has been brought, if I am
not miſinform'd, to <hi>Petersburg,</hi> and thence
to <hi>Lubec</hi> and to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> cheaper than by
the <hi>Turkey</hi> Trade to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Carriage by theſe Rivers and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravans
does not add too much to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of theſe Goods, as we are told it does
not, (the Labour of the People or Cattle
amounting to but very little in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries)
I do not ſee that the immoderate Length
of the Paſſage bears any Weight in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0040200800:34"/>
Beſides, here is one Advantage which
the Paſſage by Sea wants, <hi>viz.</hi> here is no
hazard of Loſs, no Premium to be given
for Inſurance, no Fear of Enemies or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
or of long and chargeable Embargoes,
no Averages to allow upon damag'd Goods,
or Abatement for Goods touch'd with ſalt
Water.</p>
            <p>The Navigation of the Rivers is without
Risk, the Paſſage over the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea is
a Trifle; if the Veſſels are well built, they
very rarely miſcarry: Whereas we find the
Ships, which go on with our Trade, often
ſubjected to Loſs and Miſcarriage, ſometimes
foundring at Sea, blown up by Accident with
Powder, taken by Pirates and Corſairs, as
one of the <hi>Oſtend</hi> Ships was lately by the
<hi>Turks</hi> of <hi>Barbary:</hi> And it is but a few
Years ſince no leſs than fourteen Sail of
the beſt Ships, <hi>Engliſh</hi> as well as <hi>Dutch,</hi>
very richly laden, were caſt away at the
Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> as they rode there
at Anchor; and all the Goods and People
loſt. If theſe Loſſes are diſcounted out of
the Profits of the Company they belong to,
I am of Opinion they would more than
balance the Difference of Freight in ſeven
Years Commerce. But let the Freight or
Carriage be what it will, if they ſell their
Goods as cheap at Market as our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
do or can do, I think the Queſtion
is anſwer'd; and it appears that theſe Back-Doors
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0040200800:35"/>
will in a very little time rob <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
of as much Money in their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Commerce, as not the <hi>Oſtend</hi> Company on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but as all the other Companies put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Nor
is it poſſible, at leaſt I do not ſee it
poſſible, for all the Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> to
prevent it. As for us, and the other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
Powers, our Naval Strength does not
ſignify one Farthing to it; for not a Ship,
if we had twenty times as many, can come
near to act in any Capacity in the whole
Trade from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Petersburg:</hi> Fleets
and Navies are all out of the Queſtion;
the Carriage is all by Rivers, except one
great Pond (for the <hi>Mare Caſpium</hi> is no
more;) and theſe Rivers, take the Czar and
the Great Mogul together, are all within their
own Territories, and out of every Body's
Reach.</p>
            <p>All I ſee poſſible to be done, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
Trade with <hi>Petersburg</hi> and the other
<hi>Ruſſian</hi> Ports; or, if you will go a ſhorter
Way, to commence a War, and beat the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> out of <hi>Livonia</hi> and <hi>Ingria,</hi> and
ſo give them no Ingreſs to the <hi>Baltick</hi>
Sea; tho this is not ſo eaſy to be done as
ſome may imagine: And yet if it were done,
they would ſtill find ſome Vent or other
for their Trade; and if they had the Goods,
we ſhould find ſome Way or other to come
at them: For the Proſpect of Gain is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0040200800:36"/>
ſuch a Spur to the Merchant, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can reſtrain him:
<q>—Extremos currit mercator ad Indos.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That this Way of Trade from <hi>India</hi> to
<hi>Muſcovy</hi> is not impracticable, may appear
from hence, That it was always one of
the Gates by which the <hi>Indian</hi> Goods found
a Paſſage into <hi>Europe,</hi> before the Paſſage
by Sea about the Cape of <hi>Good Hope</hi> was
found out. For thoſe Goods were brought
from the <hi>Ganges</hi> and the <hi>Indus</hi> to the <hi>Oxus;</hi>
thence, touching at the great City <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi>
deſtroy'd by <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi>
down the ſame River into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea,
and ſo into <hi>Muſcovy</hi> by the <hi>Wolga.</hi> This
Channel of Trade the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> always
kept open; only they did not then find a
Way to carry on the Traffick into the reſt
of <hi>Europe,</hi> they having little or no Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
with the Princes or Nations of any
part of the World.</p>
            <p>It were greatly to be wiſh'd indeed, that
the Trade to <hi>China</hi> and <hi>India</hi> were in it
ſelf a profitable Trade to the reſt of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
then the opening theſe Back-Doors or
By-Channels might be of ſome Uſe to us:
but as it is, I muſt confeſs it ſeems to be
nothing but opening a new Paſſage to let
in more Thieves upon us, to carry away
our ready Money; and that neither this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0040200800:37"/>
any more than the <hi>Oſtend</hi> Company ſhould
be allow'd, if it could be help'd, nor our
own be allow'd to bring any Goods but
ſuch as are abſolutely neceſſary for our Uſe;
and that as to wrought Silks, Callicoes
printed or plain, they ſhould be all entirely
expell'd, as things utterly inconſiſtent with
the Proſperity of the Linen, Woollen, and
Silk Manufactures, not of <hi>England</hi> only, but
of all the Nations of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> But to
return.</p>
            <p>By all theſe great Improvements in Trade
we ſee now the Opulence and Growth of
Power in the Empire of <hi>Ruſſia:</hi> 'Twas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Czar's Conqueſts upon the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
King of <hi>Sweden</hi> which gave him the
Opportunity of launching thus out into
Trade; and being a Prince of a penetrating
Genius, he began himſelf, that he might
ſhew his People the Advantages of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce:
Thus he took Tar, and ſome of
his richeſt Furrs, and ſeveral other Goods, all
into his own Hands, and traded with them
infinitely to his own Advantage.</p>
            <p>Then he erected a Silk Manufacture, and
having the Silk imported by his own Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
from <hi>Guilan,</hi> cauſed Manufactures,
and Men skill'd in working and weaving
Broad Silks, to be brought from <hi>France:</hi> By
which he preſently found Means to ſet up the
Silk Manufacture, and bred his own Subjects
to that and other mechanical Employments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0040200800:38"/>
Above all he apply'd himſelf to the Study
of the Mathematicks, and more particularly
of Navigation, building and fitting out Ships
of War, till we ſaw him his own Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
at the Head of a Royal Navy; whereas
he had not one Ship, no not a Yacht to
ſet his Foot in, when he firſt came into
<hi>England;</hi> nor a Port for them to enter, if
he had had any, <hi>Archangel</hi> in the <hi>White Sea</hi>
excepted.</p>
            <p>Now we ſee his Subjects trading into <hi>Spain,</hi>
as well as into other Countries, with Ships
of good Burden; and carrying Naval Stores,
the Product of their own Country, into
<hi>France, Spain, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> as well
as to <hi>Lubec,</hi> and <hi>Hamburg,</hi> and other Ports
nearer home.</p>
            <p>Since the Concluſion of the Treaty with
<hi>Sweden,</hi> call'd the Peace of <hi>Abo,</hi> how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
are the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> increas'd in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
in Shipping, and indeed in Wealth as
well as Power! and all by Trade, and that
Trade made flouriſhing by Peace: And if
their young Emperor purſues the wiſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of his Grandfather, and encourages the
two inſeparable Friends, PEACE and
TRADE, he may in time bring the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi>
to be the moſt powerful Nation in all
the Northern World.</p>
            <p>I might here enlarge upon what I hinted
before. <hi>viz.</hi> That ſeveral Nations having loſt
their Trade, by which they were made ſo
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0040200800:39"/>
formidable and conſiderable, they have alſo in
proportion ſunk in their Strength, and loſt
the Weight they bore in the Scale of Power
in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> are an eminent Example
of this, and the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> both of them in
former times very powerful and rich, but
now much ſunk thro' want or neglect of
Trade. As the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> loſt their Trade firſt,
and their Poſſeſſions in the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
by the Aggreſſion of the <hi>Turks;</hi>
ſo likewiſe they abated in Power; and
whereas before they could bring a ſtrong
Fleet into the <hi>Levant</hi> Sea, and diſputed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with the <hi>Venetians</hi> themſelves; now
they have not above five or ſix Gallies and
not one Man of War in their keeping: ſo
naturally did their Power decline with their
Commerce.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing may in proportion be
obſerv'd of the <hi>Flemings</hi> in general, and
the City of <hi>Antwerp</hi> in particular; and as
I ſaid above, of the <hi>Hans Towns,</hi> who were
once ſo powerful that they beat and burnt
the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Fleet in plain Fight at Sea;
and when any War happen'd in that Part
of the World, whoever had the <hi>Hans</hi> Fleet
on their ſide, were ſure to conquer: But as
their Trade ſupported and indeed form'd all
that Power, ſo their Trade declining, they
are no more a Body, their Power is gone,
and the little Name of a <hi>Hans</hi> or Union of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0040200800:40"/>
Merchants, which once they had and made
ſuch a Figure with, is ſunk into ſcarce a
Memorial of it in the City of <hi>Lubec.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inference from all this might be very
profitably turn'd upon our ſelves in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Conjuncture; namely, That if we would
ſtill enjoy our Wealth and Power, our Fame
and Glory, we muſt preſerve our Trade, and
to that End, as far as we can, ſhould preſerve
the publick Peace alſo; ſeeing <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Trade</hi>
are Handmaids to one another.</p>
