            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my laſt, for want of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better to write about, I told you what a World of Fending and Proving we have had of late, in this little Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of ours, about an <hi>old-caſt-Pair-of-black-Pluſh-Breeches,</hi> which <hi>John,</hi> our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Clerk, about ten Years ago, it ſeems, had made a Promiſe of to one <hi>Trim,</hi> who is our Sexton and Dog-Whipper.—To this you write me Word, that you have had more than either one or two Occaſions to know a good deal of the ſhifty Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of this ſaid Maſter <hi>Trim,</hi>—and that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0149900200:3"/>
you are aſtoniſhed, nor can you for your Soul conceive, how ſo worthleſs a Fellow, and ſo worthleſs a Thing into the Bargain, could become the Occaſion of ſuch a Racket as I have repreſented.</p>
            <p>Now, though you do not ſay expreſſly, you could wiſh to hear any more about it, yet I ſee plain enough that I have raiſed your Curioſity; and therefore, from the ſame Motive, that I ſlightly mentioned it at all in my laſt Letter, I will, in this, give you a full and very circumſtantial Account of the whole Affair.</p>
            <p>But, before I begin, I muſt firſt ſet you right in one very material Point, in which I have miſſled you, as to the true Cauſe of all this Uproar amongſt us;—which does not take its Riſe, as I then told you, from the Affair of the <hi>Breeches;</hi>—but, on the contrary, the whole Affair of the <hi>Breeches</hi> has taken its Riſe from it:—To underſtand which, you muſt know, that the firſt Beginning of the Squabble was not between <hi>John</hi> the Pariſh-Clerk and <hi>Trim</hi> the Sexton, but betwixt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Pariſh and the ſaid Maſter <hi>Trim,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0149900200:4"/>
about an old <hi>Watch-Coat,</hi> which had many Years hung up in the Church, which <hi>Trim</hi> had ſet his Heart upon; and nothing would ſerve <hi>Trim</hi> but he muſt take it home, in order to have it converted into a <hi>warm Under-Petticoat</hi> for his Wife, and a <hi>Jerkin</hi> for himſelf, againſt Winter; which, in a plaintive Tone, he moſt humbly begg'd his Reverence would conſent to.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you, Sir, who have ſo often felt it, that a Principle of ſtrong Compaſſion tranſports a generous Mind ſometimes beyond what is ſtrictly right,—the Parſon was within an Ace of being an honourable Example of this very Crime;—for no ſooner did the diſtinct Words—<hi>Petticoat—poor Wife—warm—Winter</hi> ſtrike upon his Ear,—but his Heart warmed,—and, before <hi>Trim</hi> had well got to the End of his Petition, (being a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a frank and open Temper) he told him he was welcome to it, with all his Heart and Soul. But, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſays he, as you ſee I am but juſt got down to my Living, and am an utter Stranger to all Pariſh-Matters, know nothing about this old Watch-Coat you beg of me, having never ſeen it in my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0149900200:5"/>
Life, and therefore cannot be a Judge whether 'tis fit for ſuch a Purpoſe; or, if it is, in Truth, know not whether 'tis mine to beſtow upon you or not;—you muſt have a Week or ten Days Patience, till I can make ſome Inquiries about it;—and, if I find it is in my Power, I tell you again, Man, your Wife is heartily welcome to an Under-Petticoat out of it, and you to a Jerkin, was the Thing as good again as you repreſent it.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary to inform you, Sir, in this Place, That the Parſon was earneſtly bent to ſerve <hi>Trim</hi> in this Affair, not only from the Motive of Generoſity, which I have juſtly aſcribed to him, but likewiſe from another Motive; and that was by way of making ſome Sort of Recompence for a Multitude of ſmall Services which <hi>Trim</hi> had occaſionally done, and indeed was continually doing, (as he was much about the Houſe) when his own Man was out of the Way. For all theſe Reaſons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I ſay, the Parſon of the Pariſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſerve <hi>Trim</hi> in this Matter to the utmoſt of his Power: All that was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was previouſly to inquire, if any one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0149900200:6"/>
had a <hi>Claim</hi> to it;—or whether, as it had, Time immemorial, hung up in the Church, the taking it down might not raiſe a Clamour in the Pariſh. Theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries were the very Thing that <hi>Trim</hi> dreaded in his Heart.—He knew very well that if the Parſon ſhould but ſay one Word to the Church-Wardens about it, there would be an End of the whole Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. For this, and ſome other Reaſons not neceſſary to be told you, at preſent, <hi>Trim</hi> was for allowing no Time in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;—but, on the contrary, doubled his Diligence and Importunity at the Vicarage-Houſe;—plagued the whole Family to Death;—preſſed his Suit Morning, Noon, and Night; and, to ſhorten my Story, teazed the poor Gentleman, who was but in an ill State of Health, almoſt out of his Life about it.</p>
            <p>You will not wonder, when I tell you, that all this Hurry and Precipitation, on the Side of Maſter <hi>Trim,</hi> produced its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effect on the Side of the Parſon, and that was, a Suſpicion that all was not right at the Bottom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0149900200:7"/>
He was one Evening ſitting alone in his Study, weighing and turning this Doubt every Way in his Mind; and, after an Hour and a half's ſerious Deliberation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Affair, and running over <hi>Trim</hi>'s Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour throughout,—he was juſt ſaying to himſelf, <hi>It muſt be ſo;</hi>—when a ſudden Rap at the Door put an End to his Solilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy,—and, in a few Minutes, to his Doubts too; for a Labourer in the Town, who deem'd himſelf paſt his fifty-ſecond Year, had been returned by the Conſtable in the Militia-Liſt,—and he had come, with a Groat in his Hand, to ſearch the Pariſh Regiſter for his Age.—The Parſon bid the poor Fellow put the Groat into his Pocket, and go into the Kitchen:—Then ſhutting the Study Door, and taking down the Pariſh Regiſter,—<hi>Who knows,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but I may find ſomething here about this ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame Watch-Coat?</hi>—He had ſcarce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſped the Book, in ſaying this, when he popp'd upon the very Thing he wanted, fairly wrote on the firſt Page, paſted to the Inſide of one of the Covers, whereon was a Memorandum about the very Thing in Queſtion, in theſe expreſs Words:</p>
            <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="blackletterType">The great Watch-Coat was purchaſed and given above two hundred Years ago, by the Lord of the Manor, to this Pariſh-Church, to the ſole Uſe and Behoof of the poor Sextons thereof, and their Succeſſors, for ever, to be worn up them reſpectively in winterly cold Nights, in ringing</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, Paſſing-Bells, &amp;c. <hi rend="blackletterType">which the ſaid Lord of the Manor had done, in Piety, to keep the poor Wretches warm, and for the Good of his own Soul, for which they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to pray,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. <hi>Juſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!</hi> ſaid the Parſon to himſelf, looking upwards, <hi>What an Eſcape have I had I Give this for an Under-Petticoat to</hi> Trim<hi>'s Wife! I would not have conſented to ſuch a Deſecration to be Primate of all</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>nay, I would not have diſturb'd a ſingle Button of it for half my Tythes!</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Scarce were the Words out of his Mouth, when in pops <hi>Trim</hi> with the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Exclamation under both his Arms.—I ſay, under both his Arms;—for he had actually got it ripp'd and cut out ready, his own Jerkin under one Arm, and the Petticoat under the other, in order to be carried to the Taylor to be made up,—
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0149900200:9"/>
and had juſt ſtepp'd in, in high Spirits, to ſhew the Parſon how cleverly it had held out.</p>
            <p>There are many good Similies now ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the World, but which I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time to recollect or look for, which would give you a ſtrong Conception of the Aſtoniſhment and honeſt Indignation which this unexpected Stroke of <hi>Trim</hi>'s Impudence impreſs'd upon the Parſon's Looks.—Let it ſuffice to ſay, That it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all fair Deſcription,—as well as all Power of proper Reſentment,—except this, that <hi>Trim</hi> was ordered, in a ſtern Voice, to lay the Bundles down upon the Table,—to go about his Buſineſs, and wait upon him, at his Peril, the next Morning at Eleven preciſely:—Againſt this Hour, like a wiſe Man, the Parſon had ſent to deſire <hi>John</hi> the Pariſh-Clerk, who bore an exceeding good Character as a Man of Truth, and who having, moreover, a pretty Freehold of about eighteen Pounds a Year in the Townſhip, was a leading Man in it; and, upon the whole, was ſuch a one of whom it might be ſaid,—That he rather did Honour to his Office,—than
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0149900200:10"/>
that his Office did Honour to him.—Him he ſends for, with the Church-Wardens, and one of the Sides-Men, a grave, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, old Man, to be preſent:—For as <hi>Trim</hi> had with-held the whole Truth from the Parſon, touching the Watch-Coat, he thought it probable he would as certainly do the ſame Thing to others; though this, I ſaid, was wiſe, the Trouble of the Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might have been ſpared,—becauſe the Parſon's Character was unblemiſh'd,—and he had ever been held by the World in the Eſtimation of a Man of Honour and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.—<hi>Trim</hi>'s Character, on the contrary, was as well known, if not in the World, yet, at leaſt, in all the Pariſh, to be that of a little, dirty, pimping, pettifogging, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dextrous Fellow,—who neither cared what he did or ſaid of any, provided he could get a Penny by it.—This might, I ſay, have made any Precaution needleſs;—but you muſt know, as the Parſon had in a Manner but juſt got down to his Living, he dreaded the Conſequences of the leaſt ill Impreſſion on his firſt Entrance amongſt his Pariſhioners, which would have diſabled him from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the Good he wiſhed;—ſo that, out of Regard to his Flock, more than the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0149900200:11"/>
neceſſary Care due to himſelf,—he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd not to lie at the Mercy of what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment might vent, or Malice lend an Ear to.—Accordingly the whole Matter was rehearſed from firſt to laſt by the Parſon, in the Manner I've told you, in the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>John</hi> the Pariſh-Clerk, and in the Preſence of <hi>Trim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trim</hi> had little to ſay for himſelf, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <q rend="inline">"That the Parſon had abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be friend him and his Wife in the Affair, to the utmoſt of his Power: That the Watch-Coat was certainly in his Power, and that he might ſtill give it him if he pleaſed."</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this, the Parſon's Reply was ſhort, but ſtrong, <q rend="inline">"That nothing was in his <hi>Power</hi> to do, but what he could do <hi>honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>—That in giving the Coat to him and his Wife, he ſhould do a manifeſt Wrong to the <hi>next</hi> Sexton; the great Watch-Coat being the moſt comfortable Part of the Place:—That he ſhould, moreover, injure the Right of his own Succeſſor, who would be juſt ſo much a worſe Patron, as the Worth of the Coat amounted to;—and, in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0149900200:12"/>
a Word, he declared, that his whole Intent in promiſing that Coat, was Charity to <hi>Trim;</hi> but <hi>Wrong</hi> to no Man; that was a Reſerve, he ſaid, made in all Caſes of this Kind:—and he declared ſolemnly, <hi>in Verbo Sacerdotis,</hi> That this was his Meaning, and was ſo underſtood by <hi>Trim</hi> himſelf."</q>
            </p>
            <p>With the Weight of this Truth, and the great good Senſe and ſtrong Reaſon which accompanied all the Parſon ſaid upon the Subject,—poor <hi>Trim</hi> was driven to his laſt Shift,—and begg'd he might be ſuffered to plead his Right and Title to the Watch-Coat, if not by <hi>Promiſe,</hi> at leaſt by <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>—It was well known how much he was entitled to it upon theſe Scores: That he had black'd the Parſon's Shoes without Count, and greaſed his Boots above fifty Times:—That he had run for Eggs into the Town upon all Occaſions;—whetted the Knives at all Hours;—catched his Horſe and rubbed him down:—That for his Wife ſhe had been ready upon all Occaſions to charr for them;—and neither he nor ſhe, to the beſt of his Remembrance, ever took a Farthing, or any thing beyond a Mug of Ale.—To this Account of his Services he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0149900200:13"/>
begg'd Leave to add thoſe of his Wiſhes, which, he ſaid, had been equally great.—He affirmed, and was ready, he ſaid, to make it appear, by Numbers of Witneſſes, <q rend="inline">"He had drank his Reverence's Health a thouſand Times, (by the bye, he did not add out of the Parſon's own Ale): That he not only drank his Health, but wiſh'd it; and never came to the Houſe, but aſk'd his Man kindly how he did; that in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, about half a Year ago, when his Reverence cut his Finger in paring an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he went half a Mile to aſk a cunning Woman, what was good to ſtanch Blood, and actually returned with a Cobweb in his Breeches Pocket:—Nay, ſays <hi>Trim,</hi> it was not a Fortnight ago, when your Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence took that violent Purge, that I went to the far End of the whole Town to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row you a Cloſe-ſtool,—and came back, as my Neighbours, who flouted me, will all bear witneſs, with the Pan upon my Head, and never thought it too much."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trim</hi> concluded his pathetick Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance with ſaying, <q rend="inline">"He hoped his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence's Heart would not ſuffer him to requite ſo many faithful Services by ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0149900200:14"/>
a Return:—That if it was ſo, as he was the firſt, ſo he hoped he ſhould be the laſt, Example of a Man of his Condition ſo treated."</q>—This Plan of <hi>Trim</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which <hi>Trim</hi> had put himſelf upon,—could admit of no other Reply but a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Smile.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, let me inform you, That all that could be ſaid, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> on both Sides, being fairly heard, it was plain, That <hi>Trim,</hi> in every Part of this Affair, had behaved very ill;—and <hi>one</hi> Thing, which was never expected to be known of him, happening in the Courſe of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate to come out againſt him;—namely, That he had gone and told the Parſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had ever ſet Foot in his Pariſh, That <hi>John</hi> his Pariſh-Clerk,—his Church-Wardens, and ſome of the Heads of the Pariſh, were a Parcel of Scoundrels.—Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Upſhot, <hi>Trim</hi> was kick'd out of Doors; and told, at his Peril, never to come there again.</p>
            <p>At firſt <hi>Trim</hi> huff'd and bounced moſt terribly;—ſwore he would get a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;—then nothing would ſerve him but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0149900200:15"/>
he would call a Bye-Law, and tell the whole Pariſh how the Parſon had miſuſed him;—but cooling of that, as fearing the Parſon might poſſibly bind him over to his good Behaviour, and, for aught he knew, might ſend him to the Houſe of Correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—he let the Parſon alone; and, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf, falls foul upon his Clerk, who had no more to do in the Quarrel than you or I;—rips up the Promiſe of the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt-Pair-of-black-Pluſh-Breeches, and raiſes an Uproar in the Town about it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it had ſlept ten Years.—But all this, you muſt know, is look'd upon in no other Light, but as an artful Stroke of Generalſhip in <hi>Trim,</hi> to raiſe a Duſt, and cover himſelf under the diſgraceful Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement he has undergone.</p>
            <p>If your Curioſity is not yet ſatisfied,—I will now proceed to relate the <hi>Battle</hi> of the Breeches, in the ſame exact Manner I have done <hi>that</hi> of the Watch-Coat.</p>
            <p>Be it known then, that, about ten Years ago, when <hi>John</hi> was appointed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Clerk of this Church, this ſaid Maſter <hi>Trim</hi> took no ſmall Pains to get into <hi>John</hi>'s
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0149900200:16"/>
good Graces; in order, as it afterwards appeared, to coax a Promiſe out of him of a Pair of Breeches, which <hi>John</hi> had then by him, of black Pluſh, not much the worſe for wearing;—<hi>Trim</hi> only begging for God's Sake to have them beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him when <hi>John</hi> ſhould think fit to caſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trim</hi> was one of thoſe kind of Men who loved a Bit of Finery in his Heart, and would rather have a tatter'd Rag of a Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Body's, than the beſt plain whole Thing his Wife could ſpin him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John,</hi> who was naturally unſuſpicious, made no more Difficulty of promiſing the Breeches, than the Parſon had done in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing the Great Coat; and, indeed, with ſomething leſs Reſerve,—becauſe the Breeches were <hi>John's own,</hi> and he could give them, without Wrong, to whom he thought fit.</p>
            <p>It happened, I was going to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily, but, I ſhould rather ſay, moſt luckily, for <hi>Trim,</hi> for he was the only Gainer by it,—that a Quarrel, about ſome
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0149900200:17"/>
ſix or eight Weeks after this, broke out between <hi>the late</hi> Parſon of the Pariſh and <hi>John</hi> the Clerk. Somebody (and it was thought to be Nobody but <hi>Trim</hi>) had put it into the Parſon's Head, "That <hi>John</hi>'s Deſk in the Church was, at the leaſt, four Inches higher than it ſhould be:—That the Thing gave Offence, and was indecorous, inaſmuch as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd too near upon a Level with the Parſon's Deſk itſelf. This Hardſhip the Parſon complained of loudly,—and told <hi>John</hi> one Day after Prayers,—<q rend="inline">"He could bear it no longer:—And would have it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd and brought down as it ſhould be."</q> 
               <hi>John</hi> made no other Reply, but, <q rend="inline">"That the Deſk was not of his raiſing:—That 'twas not one Hair Breadth higher than he found it;—and that as he found it, ſo would he leave it:—In ſhort, he would neither make an Encroachment, nor would he ſuffer one."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>late</hi> Parſon might have his Virtues, but the leading Part of his Character was not <hi>Humility;</hi> ſo that <hi>John</hi>'s Stiffneſs in this Point was not likely to reconcile Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.—This was <hi>Trim</hi>'s Harveſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0149900200:18"/>
After a friendly Hint to <hi>John</hi> to ſtand his Ground,—away hies <hi>Trim</hi> to make his Market at the Vicarage:—What paſs'd there, I will not ſay, intending not to be uncharitable; ſo ſhall content myſelf with only gueſſing at it, from the ſudden Change that appeared in <hi>Trim</hi>'s Dreſs for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;—for he had left his old ragged Coat, Hat and Wig, in the Stable, and was come forth ſtrutting acroſs the Church-yard, y'clad in a good creditable caſt Coat, large Hat and Wig, which the Parſon had juſt given him.—Ho! Ho! Hollo! <hi>John!</hi> cries <hi>Trim,</hi> in an inſolent Bravo, as loud as ever he could bawl—See here, my Lad! how fine I am.—The more Shame for you, anſwered <hi>John,</hi> ſeriouſly.—Do you think, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſays he, ſuch Finery, gain'd by ſuch Services, becomes you, or can wear well?—Fye upon it, <hi>Trim;</hi>—I could not have expected this from you, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what Friendſhip you pretended, and how kind I have ever been to you:—How many Shillings and Sixpences I have generouſly lent you in your Diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?—Nay, it was but t'other Day that I promiſed you theſe black Pluſh Breeches I have on.—Rot your Breeches, quoth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0149900200:19"/>
               <hi>Trim;</hi> for <hi>Trim</hi>'s Brain was half turn'd with his new Finery:—Rot your Breeches, ſays he,—I would not take them up, were they laid at my Door;—give 'em, and be d<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>d to you, to whom you like;—I would have you to know I can have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pair at the Parſon's any Day in the Week:—<hi>John</hi> told him plainly, as his Word had once paſs'd him, he had a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit above taking Advantage of his Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in giving them away to another:—But, to tell him his Mind freely, he thought he had got ſo many Favours of that Kind, and was ſo likely to get many more for the ſame Services, of the Parſon, that he had better give up the Breeches, with good Nature, to ſome one who would be more thankful for them.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>John</hi> mentioned <hi>Mark Slender,</hi> (who, it ſeems, the Day before, had aſk'd <hi>John</hi> for 'em) not knowing they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Promiſe to <hi>Trim.</hi>—<q rend="inline">"Come, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſays he, let poor <hi>Mark</hi> have 'em,—You know he has not a Pair to his A<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0149900200:20"/>
are not worth much; and beſides, you could not get your Backſide into them, if you had them, without tearing them all to Pieces."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Every Tittle of this was moſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly true; for <hi>Trim,</hi> you muſt know, by ſoul Feeding, and playing the good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at the Parſon's, was grown ſomewhat groſs about the lower Parts, <hi>if not higher:</hi> So that, as all <hi>John</hi> ſaid upon the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was fact, <hi>Trim,</hi> with much ado, and after a hundred Hum's and Hah's, at laſt, out of mere Compaſſion to <hi>Mark, ſigns, ſeals, and delivers up <hi rend="blackletterType">all Right, Intereſt, and Pretenſions whatſoever, in and to the ſaid Breeches; thereby binding his Heirs, Erecutors, Adminiſtrators, and Aſſignes, never mere to call the ſaid Claim in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this Renunciation was ſet forth in an ample Manner, to be in pure Pity to <hi>Mark</hi>'s Nakedneſs;—but the Secret was, <hi>Trim</hi> had an Eye to, and firmly expected in his own Mind, the great Green Pulpit-Cloth and old Velvet Cuſhion, which were that very Year to be taken down;—
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0149900200:21"/>
which, by the Bye, could he have wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>John</hi> a ſecond Time out of 'em, as he hoped, he had made up the Loſs of his Breeches Seven-fold.</p>
            <p>Now, you muſt know, this Pulpit-Cloth and Cuſhion were not in <hi>John's</hi> Gift, but in the Church-Wardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—However, as I ſaid above, that <hi>John</hi> was a leading Man in the Pariſh, <hi>Trim</hi> knew he could help him to them if he would:—But <hi>John</hi> had got a Surfeit of him;—ſo, when the Pulpit-Cloth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, they were immediately given (<hi>John</hi> having a great Say in it) to <hi>William Doe,</hi> who underſtood very well what Uſe to make of them.</p>
            <p>As for the old Breeches, poor <hi>Mark Slender</hi> lived to wear them but a ſhort Time, and they got into the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Lorry Slim,</hi> an unlucky Wight, by whom they are ſtill worn;—in Truth, as you will gueſs; they are very thin by this Time:—But <hi>Lorry</hi> has a light Heart; and what recommends them to him, is this, that, as thin as they are, he knows that <hi>Trim,</hi> let him ſay what he will to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſtill envies the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of them,—
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0149900200:22"/>
and, with all his Pride, would be very glad to wear them after <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Footing have theſe Affairs ſlept quietly for near ten Years,—and would have ſlept for ever, but for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Kicking-Bout; which, as I ſaid, has ripp'd this Squabble up afreſh: So that it was no longer ago than laſt Week, that <hi>Trim</hi> met and inſulted <hi>John</hi> in the public Town - Way, before a hundred People;—tax'd him with the Promiſe of the old-caſt-Pair-of-black-Breeches, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Trim</hi>'s ſolemn Renunciation; twitted him with the Pulpit-Cloth and Velvet Cuſhion,—as good as told him, he was ignorant of the common Duties of his Clerkſhip; adding, very infolently, That he knew not ſo much as to give out a common Pſalm in Tune.—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> contented himſelf with giving a plain Anſwer to every Article that <hi>Trim</hi> had laid to his Charge, and appealed to his Neighbours who remembered the whole Affair;—and as he knew there was never any Thing to be got in wreſtling with a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0149900200:23"/>
Chimney-Sweeper,—he was going to take Leave of <hi>Trim</hi> for ever.—But, hold,—the Mob by this Time had got round them, and their High Mightineſſes inſiſted upon having <hi>Trim</hi> tried upon the Spot.—<hi>Trim</hi> was accordingly tried; and, after a full Hearing, was convicted a ſecond Time, and handled more roughly by one or more of them, than even at the Parſon's.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trim,</hi> ſays one, are you not aſhamed of yourſelf, to make all this Rout and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance in the Town, and ſet Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours together by the Ears, about an old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worn-out-Pair-of-caſt-Breeches, not worth Half a Crown?—Is there a caſt-Coat, or a Place in the whole Town, that will bring you in a Shilling, but what you have ſnapp'd up, like a greedy Hound as you are?</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>I Have broke open my Letter to inform you, that I miſs'd the Opportunity of ſending it by the Meſſenger, who I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected would have called upon me in his Return through this Village to <hi>York,</hi> ſo it has laid a Week or ten Days by me.</p>
            <p>—I am not ſorry for the Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe ſomething has ſince hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, in Continuation of this Affair, which I am thereby enabled to tranſmit to you, all under one Trouble.</p>
            <p>When I finiſhed the above Account, I thought (as did every Soul in the Pariſh) <hi>Trim</hi> had met with ſo thorough a Rebuff from <hi>John</hi> the Pariſh - Clerk and the Town's Folks, who all took againſt him, that <hi>Trim</hi> would be glad to be quiet, and let the Matter reſt.</p>
            <p>But, it ſeems, it is not half an Hour ago ſince <hi>Trim</hi> ſallied forth again; and, having borrowed a Sow-Gelder's Horn, with hard Blowing he got the whole Town round him, and endeavoured to raiſe a Diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0149900200:27"/>
and fight the whole Battle over again:—That he had been uſed in the laſt Fray worſe than a Dog;—not by <hi>John</hi> the Pariſh-Clerk,—for I ſhou'd not, quoth <hi>Trim,</hi> have valued him a Ruſh ſingle Hands:—But all the Town ſided with him, and twelve Men in <hi>Buckram</hi> ſet upon me all at once, and kept me in Play at Sword's Point for three Hours together.—Beſides, quoth <hi>Trim,</hi> there were two miſbegotten Knaves in <hi>Kendal Green,</hi> who lay all the while in Ambuſh in <hi>John</hi>'s own Houſe, and they all <hi>ſixteen</hi> came upon my Back, and let drive at me together.—A Plague, ſays <hi>Trim,</hi> of all Cowards!—<hi>Trim</hi> repeated this Story above a Dozen Times;—which made ſome of the Neighbours pity him, thinking the poor Fellow crack-brain'd, and that he actually believed what he ſaid. After this <hi>Trim</hi> dropp'd the Affair of the <hi>Breeches,</hi> and begun a freſh Diſpute about the <hi>Reading-Deſk,</hi> which I told you had occaſioned ſome ſmall Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>late</hi> Parſon and <hi>John,</hi> ſome Years ago.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Reading-Deſk,</hi> as you will obſerve, was but an Epiſode wove into the main Story by the Bye;—for the main Affair
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0149900200:28"/>
was the <hi>Battle of the Breeches</hi> and <hi>Great Watch-Coat.</hi>—However, <hi>Trim</hi> being at laſt driven out of theſe two Citadels,—he has ſeized hold, in his Retreat, of this <hi>Reading-Deſk,</hi> with a View, as it ſeems, to take Shelter behind it.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſay but the Man has fought it out obſtinately enough;—and, had his Cauſe been good, I ſhould have really pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied him. For when he was driven out of the <hi>Great Watch-Coat,</hi>—you ſee, he did not run away;—no,—he retreated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the <hi>Breeches;</hi>—and, when he could make nothing of it behind the <hi>Breeches,</hi>—he got behind the <hi>Reading-Deſk.</hi>—To what other Hold <hi>Trim</hi> will next retreat, the Politicians of this Village are not agreed.—Some think his next Move will be towards the Rear of the Parſon's Boot;—but, as it is thought he cannot make a long Stand there,—others are of Opinion, That <hi>Trim</hi> will once more in his Life get hold of the Parſon's Horſe, and charge upon him, or perhaps behind him.—But as the Horſe is not eaſy to be caught, the more general Opinion is, That, when he is driven out of the <hi>Reading-Deſk,</hi> he will make his laſt Retreat in ſuch a Manner as, if poſſible,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0149900200:29"/>
to gain the <hi>Cloſe-Stool,</hi> and defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf behind it to the very laſt Drop. If <hi>Trim</hi> ſhould make this Movement, by my Advice he ſhould be left beſides his Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, in full Poſſeſſion of the Field of Battle;—where, 'tis certain, he will keep every Body a League off, and may pop by himſelf till he is weary: Beſides, as <hi>Trim</hi> ſeems bent upon <hi>purging</hi> himſelf, and may have Abundance of foul Humours to work off, I think he cannot be better placed.</p>
            <p>But this is all Matter of Speculation.—Let me carry you back to Matter of Fact, and tell you what Kind of a Stand <hi>Trim</hi> has actually made behind the ſaid <hi>Deſk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"Neighbours and Townſmen all, I will be ſworn before my Lord Mayor, That <hi>John</hi> and his nineteen Men in <hi>Buckram,</hi> have abuſed me worſe than a Dog; for they told you that I play'd faſt and go-looſe with the <hi>late</hi> Parſon and him, in that old Diſpute of theirs about the <hi>Reading-Deſk;</hi> and that I made Matters worſe between them, and not better."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of this Charge, <hi>Trim</hi> declared he was as innocent as the Child that was unborn:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0149900200:30"/>
That he would be Book-ſworn he had no Hand in it. He produced a ſtrong Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;—and, moreover, inſinuated, that <hi>John</hi> himſelf, inſtead of being angry for what he had done in it, had actually thank'd him. Aye, <hi>Trim,</hi> ſays the Wight in the Pluſh Breeches, but that was, <hi>Trim,</hi> the Day before <hi>John</hi> found thee out.—Beſides, <hi>Trim,</hi> there is nothing in that:—For, the very Year that thou waſt made Town's Pinder, thou knoweſt well, that I both thank'd thee myſelf; and, moreover, gave thee a good warm Supper for turning <hi>John Lund</hi>'s Cows and Horſes out of my Hard-Corn Cloſe; which if thou had'ſt not done, (as thou told'ſt me) I ſhould have loſt my whole Crop: Whereas, <hi>John Lund</hi> and <hi>Thomas Patt,</hi> who are both here to teſtify, and will take their Oaths on't, That thou thyſelf waſt the very Man who ſet the Gate open; and, after all,—it was not thee, <hi>Trim,</hi>—'twas the Blackſmith's poor Lad who turn'd them out: So that a Man may be thank'd and rewarded too for a good Turn which he never did, nor ever did intend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trim</hi> could not ſuſtain this unexpected Stroke;—ſo <hi>Trim</hi> march'd off the Field,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0149900200:31"/>
without Colours flying, or his Horn ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any other Enſigns of Honour whatever.</p>
            <p>Whether after this <hi>Trim</hi> intends to rally a ſecond Time,—or whether <hi>Trim</hi> may not take it into his Head to claim the Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,—no one but <hi>Trim</hi> himſelf can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you:—However, the general Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, upon the whole, is this,—That, in three ſeveral pitch'd Battles, <hi>Trim</hi> has been ſo <hi>trimm'd,</hi> as never diſaſtrous Hero was trimm'd before him.</p>

            <p>The Preſident of the Night, who is thought to be as clear and quick-ſighted as any one of the whole Club in Things of this Nature, diſcovered plainly, That the Diſturbances therein ſet forth, related to thoſe on the <hi>Continent:</hi>—That <hi>Trim</hi> could be Nobody but the King of <hi>France,</hi> by whoſe ſhifting and intriguing Behaviour, all <hi>Europe</hi> was ſet together by the Ears:—'That <hi>Trim</hi>'s Wife was certainly the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,</hi> who are as kind together, ſays he, as any Man and Wife can be for their

Lives.—The more Shame for 'em, ſays an Alderman, low to himſelf.—Agreeable to this Key, continues the Preſident,—The <hi>Parſon,</hi> who I think is a moſt excellent Character,—is His Moſt Excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty King <hi>Gearge;</hi>—<hi>John,</hi> the Pariſh-Clerk, is the King of <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> who, by the Manner of his firſt entering <hi>Saxony,</hi> ſhew'd the World moſt evidently,—That he did know how to lead out the Pſalm, and in Tune and Time too, notwithſtanding <hi>Trim</hi>'s vile Inſult upon him in that Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.—But who do you think, ſays a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon and Man-Midwife, who ſat next him, (whoſe Coat-Button the Preſident, in the Earneſtneſs of this Explanation, had got faſt hold of, and had thereby partly drawn him over to his Opinion) Who do you think, Mr. Preſident, ſays he, are meant by the <hi>Church-Wardens, Sides-Men, Mark Slender, Lorry Slim, &amp;c.</hi>—Who do I think? ſays he, Why,—Why, Sir, as I take the Thing,—the <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> and <hi>Sides-Men,</hi> are the <hi>Electors</hi> and the other <hi>Princes</hi> who form the <hi>Germanick Body.</hi>—And as for the other ſubordinate Characters of <hi>Mark Slim,</hi>—the <hi>unlucky Wight</hi> in the Pluſh Breeches,—the <hi>Parſon</hi>'s
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0149900200:38"/>
               <hi>Man</hi> who was ſo often out of the Way, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>—theſe, to be ſure, are the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Marſhals</hi> and <hi>Generals,</hi> who fought, or ſhould have fought, under them the laſt Campaign.—The Men in <hi>Buckram,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Preſident, are the Groſs of the King of <hi>Pruſſia</hi>'s Army, who are as <hi>ſtiff</hi> a Body of Men as are in the World:—And <hi>Trim</hi>'s ſaying they were twelve, and then nineteen, is a Wipe for the <hi>Bruſſels Gazet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer,</hi> who, to my Knowledge, was never two Weeks in the ſame Story, about that or any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>As for the reſt of the <hi>Romance,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Preſident, it ſufficiently explains it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,—The <hi>Old-caſt-Pair-of-Black-Pluſh-Breeches</hi> muſt be <hi>Saxony,</hi> which the <hi>Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> you ſee, <hi>has left off wearing:</hi>—And as for the <hi>Great Watch-Coat,</hi> which, you know, covers all, it ſignifies all <hi>Europe;</hi> comprehending, at leaſt, ſo many of its different States and Dominions, as we have any Concern with in the preſent War.</p>
            <p>I proteſt, ſays a Gentleman who ſat next but one to the Preſident, and who, it ſeems, was the Parſon of the Pariſh, a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0149900200:39"/>
Member not only of the Political, but alſo of a Muſical Club in the next Street;—I proteſt, ſays he, if this Explanation is right, which I think it is,—That the whole makes a very fine Symbol.—You have always ſome Muſical Inſtrument or other in your Head, I think, ſays the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman.—Muſical Inſtrument! replies the Parſon, in Aſtoniſhment,—Mr. Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I mean an Allegory; and I think the greedy Diſpoſition of <hi>Trim</hi> and his Wife, in ripping the <hi>Great Watch-Coat</hi> to Pieces, in order to convert it into a Petticoat for the one, and a Jerkin for the other, is one of the moſt beautiful of the Kind I ever met with; and will ſhew all the World what have been the true Views and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Houſes of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> in this abominable Coalition,—I might have called it Whoredom:—Nay, ſays the Alderman, 'tis downright Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terydom, or nothing.</p>
            <p>This Hypotheſis of the Preſident's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd every Thing in the <hi>Romance</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly well; and, withall, was delivered with ſo much Readineſs and Air of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, as begot an Opinion in two Thirds of the Club, that Mr. Preſident was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0149900200:40"/>
the Author of the <hi>Romance</hi> himſelf: But a Gentleman who ſat on the oppoſite Side of the Table, who had come piping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot from reading the Hiſtory of King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>'s and Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s Wars, and who was thought, at the Bottom, to envy the Preſident the Honour both of the <hi>Romance</hi> and Explanation too, gave an entire new Turn to it all. He acquainted the Club, That Mr. Preſident was altogether wrong in every Suppoſition he had made, except that one, where the <hi>Great Watch-Coat</hi> was ſaid by him to repreſent <hi>Europe,</hi> or at leaſt a great Part of it:—So far he acknowledged he was pretty right; but that he had not gone far enough backwards into our Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to come at the Truth. He then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them, that the dividing the <hi>Great Watch-Coat</hi> did, and could, allude to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the World but the <hi>Partition-Treaty;</hi> which, by the Bye, he told them, was the moſt unhappy and ſcandalous Tranſaction in all King <hi>William</hi>'s Life: It was that falſe Step, and that only, ſays he, riſing from his Chair, and ſtriking his Hand upon the Table with great Violence; it was that falſe Step, ſays he, knitting his Brows
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0149900200:41"/>
and throwing his Pipe down upon the Ground, that has laid the Foundation of all the Diſturbances and Sorrows we feel and lament at this very Hour; and as for <hi>Trim</hi>'s giving up the <hi>Breeches,</hi> look ye, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Word for Word copied from the <hi>French</hi> King and <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Renunciation of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> which all the World knew (as was the very Caſe of the <hi>Breeches</hi>) were renounced by them on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be reclaim'd when Time ſhould ſerve.</p>
            <p>This Explanation had too much Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity in it to be altogether ſlighted; and, in Truth, the worſt Fault it had, ſeem'd to be the prodigious Heat of it; which (as an Apothecary, who ſat next the Fire, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, in a very low Whiſper to his next Neighbour) was ſo much incorporated into every Particle of it, that it was impoſſible, under ſuch Fermentation, it ſhould work its deſired Effect.</p>
            <p>This, however, no way intimidated a little valiant Gentleman, though he ſat the very next Man, from giving an Opinion as diametrically oppoſite as <hi>Eaſt</hi> is from <hi>Weſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0149900200:42"/>
This Gentleman, who was by much the beſt Geographer in the whole Club, and, moreover, ſecond Couſin to an Engineer, was poſitive the <hi>Breeches</hi> meant <hi>Gibraltar;</hi> for, if you remember, Gentlemen, ſays he, tho' poſſibly you don't, the Ichnography and Plan of that Town and Fortreſs, it exactly reſembles a Pair of Trunk-Hoſe, the two Promontories forming the two Slops, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>—Now we all know, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, that King <hi>George</hi> the Firſt made a Promiſe of that important Paſs to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi>—So that the whole Drift of the <hi>Romance,</hi> according to my Senſe of Things, is merely to vindicate the King and the Parliament in that Tranſaction, which made ſo much Noiſe in the World.</p>
            <p>A Wholeſale Taylor, who from the Beginning had reſolved not to ſpeak at all in the Debate,—was at laſt drawn into it, by ſomething very unexpected in the laſt Perſon's Argument.</p>
            <p>He told the Company, frankly, he did not underſtand what <hi>Ichnography</hi> meant:—But as for the Shape of a <hi>Pair of Breeches,</hi> as he had had the Advantage of cutting out ſo many hundred Pairs in his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0149900200:43"/>
Life-Time, he hoped he might be allowed to know as much of the Matter as another Man.</p>
            <p>Now, to my Mind, ſays he, there is nothing in all the Terraqueous Globe (a Map of which, it ſeems, hung up in his Work-Shop) ſo like a <hi>Pair of Breeches</hi> unmade up, as the Iſland of <hi>Sicily:</hi>—Nor is there any thing, if you go to that, quoth an honeſt Shoe-maker, who had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be a Member of the Club, ſo much like a <hi>Jack-Boot,</hi> to my Fancy, as the Kingdom of <hi>Italy.</hi>—What the Duce has either <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Sicily</hi> to do in the Affair? cries the Preſident, who, by this Time, began to tremble for his Hypotheſis,—What have they to do?—Why, anſwered the <hi>Partition-Treaty</hi> Gentleman, with great Spirit and Joy ſparkling in his Eyes,—They have juſt ſo much, Sir, to do in the Debate as to overthrow your Suppoſitions, and to eſtabliſh the Certainty of mine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Poſſibility of a Doubt: For, ſays he, (with an Air of Sovereign Triumph over the Preſident's Politicks)—By the <hi>Partition-Treaty,</hi> Sir, both <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> were the very Kingdoms made to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0149900200:44"/>
devolve upon the <hi>Dauphin;</hi>—and <hi>Trim</hi>'s <hi>greaſing the Parſon's Boots,</hi> is a Deviliſh Satyrical Stroke;—for it expoſes the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Bribery made Uſe of at that Juncture, in bringing over the ſeveral States and Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to uſe their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſtop the Pope from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Inveſtitures of thoſe Kingdoms to any Body elſe.—The Pope has not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of <hi>Sicily,</hi> cries another Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.—I care not, ſays he, for that.</p>
            <p>Almoſt every one apprehended the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate to be now ended, and that no one Member would venture any new Conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the <hi>Romance,</hi> after ſo many clear and deciſive Interpretations had been given. But, hold,—Cloſe to the Fire, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to where the Apothecary ſat, there ſat alſo a Gentleman of the Law, who, from the Beginning to the End of the Hearing of this Cauſe, ſeem'd no way ſatisfied in his Conſcience with any one Proceeding in it. This Gentleman had not yet opened his Mouth, but had waited patiently till they had all gone thro' their ſeveral Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences on the other Side;—reſerving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, like an expert Practitioner, for the laſt Word in the Debate. When the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0149900200:45"/>
               <hi>Partition-Treaty-</hi>Gentleman had finiſh'd what he had to ſay,—He got up,—and, advancing towards the Table, told them, That the Error they had all gone upon thus far, in making out the ſeveral Facts in the <hi>Romance,</hi>—was in looking too high; which, with great Candor, he ſaid, was a very natural Thing, and very excuſable withall, in ſuch a Political Club as theirs: For Inſtance, continues he, you have been ſearching the <hi>Regiſters,</hi> and looking into the <hi>Deeds</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperors,</hi>—as if Nobody had any <hi>Deeds</hi> to ſhew or compare the <hi>Romance</hi> to but themſelves.—This, continued the Attorney, is juſt as much out of the Way of good Practice, as if I ſhould carry a Thing ſlap-daſh into the Houſe of Lords, which was under forty Shillings, and might be decided in the next County-Court for ſix Shillings and Eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.—He then took the <hi>Romance</hi> in his Left Hand, and pointing with the Fore-Finger of his Right towards the ſecond Page, he humbly begg'd Leave to obſerve, (and, to do him Juſtice, he did it in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of a <hi>forenſic Air</hi>) That the <hi>Parſon, John,</hi> and <hi>Sexton,</hi> ſhewed inconteſtably the Thing to be <hi>Tripartite;</hi> now, if you will take Notice, Gentlemen, ſays he,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0149900200:46"/>
theſe ſeveral Perſons, who are Parties to this Inſtrument, are merely Eccleſiaſtical; that the <hi>Reading-Deſk, Pulpit-Cloth,</hi> and <hi>Velvet Cuſhion,</hi> are tripartite too; and are, by Intendment of Law, Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles merely of an Eccleſiaſtick Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing and appertaining 'only unto them,' <hi>and to them only.</hi>—So that it appears very plain to me, That the <hi>Romance,</hi> neither directly nor indirectly, goes upon Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but altogether upon Church-Matters.—And do not you think, ſays he, ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Voice a little, and addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Parſon with a forced Smile,—Do not you think Doctor, ſays he, That the Diſpute in the <hi>Romance,</hi> between the <hi>Parſon</hi> of the Pariſh and <hi>John,</hi> about the Height of <hi>John</hi>'s Deſk, is a very fine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick upon the <hi>Humility</hi> of <hi>Church-Men?</hi>—I think, ſays the Parſon, it is much of the ſame Fineneſs with that which your Profeſſion is complimented with, in the pimping, dirty, pettyfogging Character of <hi>Trim,</hi>—which, in my Opinion, Sir, is juſt ſuch another Panegyrick upon the <hi>Honeſty</hi> of <hi>Attornies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing whets the Spirits like an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult:—Therefore the Parſon went on with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0149900200:47"/>
a viſible Superiority and an uncommon Acuteneſs.—As you are ſo happy, Sir, continues he, in making Applications,—pray turn over a Page or two to the black Law-Letters in the <hi>Romance.</hi>—What do you think of them, Sir?—Nay,—pray read the Grant of the <hi>Great Watch-Coat</hi>—and <hi>Trim</hi>'s Renunciation of the <hi>Breeches.</hi>—Why, there is downright <hi rend="blackletterType">Leaſe</hi> and <hi rend="blackletterType">Releaſe</hi> for you,—'tis the very Thing, Man;—only with this ſmall Difference,—and in which conſiſts the whole Strength of the Panegyric,—That the Author of the <hi>Romance</hi> has convey'd and re-convey'd, in about ten Lines,—what you, with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Prolixity of the Law, could not have crowded into as many Skins of Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Apothecary, who had paid the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, the ſame Afternoon, a Demand of Three Pounds Six Shillings and Eight-Pence, for much ſuch another Jobb,—was ſo highly tickled with the Parſon's Repartee in that particular Point,—that he rubb'd his Hands together moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently,—and laugh'd moſt triumphantly thereupon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0149900200:48"/>
This could not eſcape the Attorney's Notice, any more than the Cauſe of it did eſcape his Penetration.</p>
            <p>I think, Sir, ſays he, (dropping his Voice a Third) you might well have ſpared this immoderate Mirth, ſince you and your Profeſſion have the leaſt Reaſon to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph here of any of us.—I beg, quoth he, that you would reflect a Moment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Cob-Web</hi> which <hi>Trim</hi> went ſo far for, and brought back with an Air of ſo much Importance, in his Breeches Pocket, to lay upon the Parſon's cut Finger.—This ſaid Cob-Web, Sir, is a fine-ſpun Satyre, upon the flimſy Nature of one Half of the Shop-Medicines, with which you make a Property of the Sick, the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and the Unſuſpecting.—And as for the Moral of the <hi>Cloſe-Stool-Pan,</hi> Sir, 'tis too plain,—Does not nine Parts in ten of the whole Practice, and of all you vend under <hi>its Colours,</hi> paſs into and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center in that one naſty Utenſil?—And let me tell you, Sir, ſays he, raiſing his Voice,—had not your unſeaſonable Mirth blinded you, you might have ſeen that <hi>Trim</hi>'s carrying the Cloſe-Stool-Pan upon his Head the whole Length of the Town,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0149900200:49"/>
without bluſhing, is a pointed Raillery,—and one of the ſharpeſt Sarcaſms, Sir, that ever was thrown out upon you;—for it unveils the ſolemn Impudence of the whole Profeſſion, who, I ſee, are aſhamed of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which brings in Money.</p>
            <p>There were two Apothecaries in the Club, beſides the Surgeon mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with a Chemiſt and an Undertaker, who all felt themſelves equally hurt and aggrieved by this diſcourteous Retort:—And they were all five riſing up together from their Chairs, with full Intent of Heart, as it was thought, to return the <hi>Reproof Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant</hi> thereupon.—But the Preſident, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it would end in a general Engagement, he inſtantly call'd out, <hi>To Order;</hi>—and gave Notice, That if there was any Member in the Club, who had not yet ſpoke, and yet did deſire to ſpeak upon the main Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Debate,—that he ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately be heard.</p>
            <p>This was a happy Invitation for a ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Member, who, it ſeems, had but a weak Voice at the beſt; and having often attempted to ſpeak in the Debate, but to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0149900200:50"/>
no Purpoſe, had ſat down in utter Deſpair of an Opportunity.</p>
            <p>This Member, you muſt know, had got a ſad Cruſh upon his Hip, in the late <hi>Election,</hi> which gave him intolerable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh;—ſo that, in ſhort, he could think of nothing elſe:—For which Cauſe, and others, he was ſtrongly of Opinion, That the whole <hi>Romance</hi> was a juſt Gird at the late <hi>York</hi> Election; and I think, ſays he, that the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of the <hi>Breeches</hi> broke, may well and truly ſignify <hi>Somebody's elſe Promiſe,</hi> which was broke, and occaſion'd ſo much Diſturbance amongſt us.</p>
            <p>—Thus every Man turn'd the Story to what was ſwimming uppermoſt in his own Brain;—ſo that, before all was over, there were full as many Satyres ſpun out of it,—and as great a Variety of Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, Opinions, Tranſactions, and Truths, found to lay hid under the dark Veil of its Allegory, as ever were diſcovered in the thrice-renowned Hiſtory of the Acts of <hi>Gargantua</hi> and <hi>Pantagruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the Cloſe of all, and juſt before the Club was going to break up,—Mr. Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0149900200:51"/>
roſe from his Chair, and begg'd Leave to make the two following Motions, which were inſtantly agreed to, without any Diviſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Gentlemen, ſays he, as <hi>Trim</hi>'s Character in the <hi>Romance,</hi> of a ſhuffling intriguing Fellow,—whoever it was drawn for, is, in Truth, as like the <hi>French King</hi> as it can ſtare,—I move, That the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> be forthwith <hi>printed:</hi>—For, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues he, if we can but once turn the Laugh againſt him, and make him aſham'd of what he has done, it may be a great Means, with the Bleſſing of God upon our Fleets and Armies, to ſave the Liberties of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> Place, I move, That Mr. Attorney, our worthy Member, be deſired to take Minutes, upon the Spot, of every Conjecture which has been made upon the <hi>Romance,</hi> by the ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who have ſpoke; which, I think, ſays he, will anſwer two good Ends:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> It will eſtabliſh the Political Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Club for ever, and place it in a reſpectable Light to all the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0149900200:52"/>
In the <hi>next</hi> Place, it will furniſh what will be wanted; that is, a <hi>Key</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</hi>—In troth you might have ſaid a whole Bunch of <hi>Keys,</hi> quoth a White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, who was the only Member in the Club who had not ſaid ſomething in the Debate: But let me tell you, Mr. Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſays he, That the <hi>Right Key,</hi> if it could but be found, would be worth the whole Bunch put together.</p>
