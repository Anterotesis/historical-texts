            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is with the Writings of Mankind, in ſome Meaſure, as with their Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or their Dreſs, each Nation hath a Peculiarity in all theſe, to diſtinguiſh it from the reſt of the World.</p>
            <p>The Gravity of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the Levity of the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> are as evident in all their Productions as in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons themſelves; and the Stile of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen is as naturally Strong and Nervous, as that of an <hi>Arabian</hi> or <hi>Perſian</hi> is rich and figurative.</p>
            <p>There is an Elegancy and Wildneſs of Thought which recommends all their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; and our Genius's are as much too cold for the Entertainment of ſuch Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, as our Climate is for their Fruits and Spices. If any of theſe Beauties are to be found in the following <hi>Eclogues,</hi> I hope my Reader will conſider them as an Argument of their being Original. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them at the Hands of a Merchant, who had made it his Buſineſs to enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0356802000:4"/>
with the Learning, as well as the Silks and Carpets of the <hi>Perſians.</hi> The little Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I could gather concerning their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, was, That his Name was <hi>Mahamed,</hi> and that he was a Native of <hi>Tauris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was in that City that he died of a Diſtemper fatal in thoſe Parts, whilſt he was engag'd in celebrating the Victories of his favourite Monarch, <hi>the Great Abbas.</hi> As to the <hi>Eclogues</hi> themſelves, they give a very juſt View of the Miſeries, and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, as well as the Felicities that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend one of the fineſt Countries in the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>The Time of the Writing them was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably in the Beginning of <hi>Sha Sultan Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeyn</hi>'s Reign, the Succeſſor of <hi>Sefi</hi> or <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>Whatever Defects, as, I doubt not, there will be many, fall under the Reader's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, I hope his Candour will incline him to make the following Reflections:</p>
            <p>That the Works of <hi>Orientals</hi> contain many Peculiarities, and that thro' Defect of Language few <hi>European</hi> Tranſlators can do them Juſtice.</p>
