            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Of Chriſt's Deſcending into HELL.</head>
            <p>SOme of the Learned ſay, <hi>Chriſt Deſcended into Hell,</hi> and for Proof alledge, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27. Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> ſaith, that thoſe Words of Chriſt (<hi>Deſcended into Hell</hi>) is not found in the moſt ancient Creeds; Dr. <hi>William Whitaker</hi> ſaith, I could produce fifty of the moſt ancient Creeds that have not theſe Words (<hi>He Deſcended into Hell,</hi>) in his Anſwer to <hi>Campion,</hi> pag. 215. Mr. <hi>William Perkins</hi> on the Creed, ſaith, It ſeems likely that theſe Words (<hi>He Deſcended into Hell</hi>) were not placed in the Creed at firſt, and that it crept in by Negligence; for above threeſcore Creeds of the moſt ancient Councils and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers want this Clauſe (<hi>He Deſcended into Hell,</hi>) among the reſt, not found in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, nor found in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, nor uſed in the Church of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo ſome of the Learned ſay, Chriſt deſcended not into Hell, yet it is an Article of their Faith; but if you ſay he did not deſcend into Hell, they will ſay you deny the Faith, and are a Heretick, and a Blaſphemer, and you may be glad if ye can eſcape ſo; themſelves interpret Hell other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than for a Place of Torments never to end: Mr. <hi>Bucer</hi> ſaith, Chriſt deſcending into Hell, is to be underſtood of his Burial; Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, Hell is the Sorrow of Mind Chriſt was in before his Death: <hi>Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Is God's hiding his Face when he was upon the Croſs? (ſaith Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> againſt <hi>Campion,</hi> pag. 221.) for upon the Croſs he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> John 9.30. therefore his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was at an End. Some of the Papiſts confeſs Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not after his Death, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.44,45. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus Catechiſ.</hi> pag. 350. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, Hell is the inward Sufferings of Chriſt on the Croſs: <hi>Bernard</hi> makes the Grief of Chriſt's Soul his <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Ames,</hi> in his <hi>Marrow of Divinity,</hi> pag, 65. ſaith, That of the Place of <hi>Hell,</hi> and manner of Torture there, the Scripture hath not pronounced any thing diſtinctly: If ſo, then the Word of God ſaith not any thing at all of them; for that which the Scripture ſpeaks, it ſpeaks diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, elſe it could not have been read diſtinctly, <hi>Neh.</hi> 3.8. That which is ſpoken expreſly, is ſpoken diſtinctly; the Spirit ſpeaks expreſly, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. The Word of the Lord came expreſly, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.3. That which is not ſpoken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0275800700:3"/>
cannot be underſtood, as appears 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.2, to 17.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> ſaith plainly, That neither in the <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> nor <hi>Latin,</hi> there is no Word proper for <hi>Hell</hi> (as we take <hi>Hell</hi>) for the Place of Puniſhment of the Ungodly, <hi>Fulk</hi>'s <hi>Defence Tranſlation,</hi> pag. 13, 87, 89. Is not this a full Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt their Opinion of the Torments of <hi>Hell?</hi> For if it be not to be read in the Word of God, what have we to do with it? We are not to believe any thing in Religion, unleſs it be written. <hi>How readeſt thou?</hi> ſaith Chriſt: <hi>Revealed things belong to us,</hi> Deut. 29.29. <hi>As it is written, I believed,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. They confeſs it is not written; then, ſure I am, it is not to be by any affirmed nor believed; meddle not with Things not revealed, they are but groundleſs Conceits, Fables, and Traditions of Men.</p>
            <p>That the word <hi>Hell</hi> is not in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for the word in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> word <hi>Hell</hi> is put, is <hi>Sheol</hi>; the proper Signification of <hi>Sheol</hi> is the Grave, as all that be learned in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> do know. <hi>Sheol</hi> hath its ſignification of <hi>Shaal,</hi> to crave or require; therefore it is one of the four that is never ſatisfied, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.15. We learn the Propriety of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word from the learned Rabbies, ſaith Dr. <hi>Fulk, Def. Tranſ. Bib.</hi> p. 90. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbies are, for ſignification of Words, faithful Interpreters; they ſay, <hi>Sheol</hi> is the Grave; Rabbi <hi>Levi,</hi> according to the Opinion of the Learned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds <hi>Sheol</hi> to be the loweſt Region of the World oppoſite to Heaven; <hi>If I deſcend into Sheol, thou art preſent.</hi> So Rabbi <hi>Abraham</hi> on <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. And <hi>David Chimchi</hi> and <hi>R. Solomon</hi>; read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.16,17. <hi>Let the wicked be turned into Sheol</hi>; that is, Death's Eſtate or deadly Bed: <hi>Jonah</hi> calls the <hi>Belly</hi> of the <hi>Whale Sheol,</hi> Jon. 2.2,3. Rabbi <hi>Solomon Jarchi</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.35. ſaith, That the true and proper Interpretation of <hi>Sheol,</hi> is <hi>Keber,</hi> which is the Grave; the <hi>hoar Head</hi> is ſaid to <hi>go down Sheol,</hi> Gen. 42.31. In <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. it is ſaid, <hi>They, their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and Cattle went alive to Shelach</hi>; that is, the Pit or Grave; <hi>Our Bones are ſcattered at the very brink or mouth of Sheol,</hi> Pſal. 141.7. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will go down to my ſon Joſeph to Sheol,</hi> Gen. 37.35. The Proteſtant Writers ſay, <hi>Sheol</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies the Grave. Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi>'s Anſwer to the Preface <hi>Remiſt.</hi> p. 22. ſo alſo in his <hi>Defence,</hi> p. 91. Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Sheol</hi> properly ſignifies nothing but the Grave or Pit. <hi>Fulk</hi> ſaith, The beſt of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> that either interpreted Scripture, or made Dictionaries, <hi>Jews</hi> or Chriſtians, ſay <hi>Sheol</hi> properly ſignifies the Grave, <hi>pag.</hi> 89. and that Deliverance

            <p>The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt retaineth the word <hi>Sheol,</hi> and tranſlates it the Houſe of the Grave, <hi>pag.</hi> 11.15. they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret <hi>Sheol, Keburata,</hi> the Grave, <hi>Job</hi> 21.5,13,14. be i'th' <hi>Keburata,</hi> the Houſe of the Grave, <hi>p.</hi> 17.12. Rabbi <hi>Abraham Reriſtſol</hi> joins <hi>Sheol</hi> and <hi>Keber</hi> together, both ſignifying the Grave; and ſo doth Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> in his <hi>Defence,</hi> pag. 91. and ſo Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27. Mr. <hi>Gradock</hi> ſaith, Hell is not mentioned in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> but as it is taken for the Grave, in his <hi>Good News,</hi> pag. 43.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sheol</hi> enforces not any Place of Puniſhment, becauſe it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified not any Place of Puniſhment; ſo ſays Dr. <hi>Willet Synopſ.</hi> pag. 1055. alſo he ſaith, the word <hi>Sheol</hi> cannot be tranſlated but for the Grave. There are four Words in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> expreſſing the ſame thing in effect that <hi>Sheol</hi> doth, yet none of them applicable to ſignifie any Place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the firſt is <hi>Shacath, fovea,</hi> the Pit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9. the ſecond is <hi>Bhor,</hi> the Lake; the third is <hi>Cheber,</hi> the Grave; both theſe Words uſed for the ſame Thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.3. the word is <hi>Sheol,</hi> v. 45. the other Word uſed as expreſſing the former; and all theſe three do contain a Deſcription of Death and the Grave; the fourth is <hi>Tehemoth, Abyſſus Terrae, Thou wilt take me from the depth of the earth,</hi> Pſal. 71.20. in all which there is no mention of a Place of Torment, <hi>Willet Synop.</hi> p. 1050.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> tranſlates <hi>Sheol</hi> into <hi>Haiden</hi> or <hi>Haides</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> taſted Death and went to the Grave, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. The Gates of <hi>Sheol</hi> is Death; <hi>Sheol</hi> and <hi>Haides</hi> are ſaid to have Gates, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.8.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Septuagint</hi> expreſs a Place generally to receive the Dead; the Word uſed in the <hi>Greek</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Sheol,</hi> ſignifies a dark Place, ſuch as the Grave or Pit in which the Dead are laid. Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> ſaith, Some take the <hi>Greek</hi> word for Hell, but it ſignifies the Grave; Hell it cannot ſignifie in their Speech that believe no Hell; the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay plainly, that their Souls ſhall vaniſh like light Smoak or light Air, <hi>Fulk Def.</hi> p. 92. alſo he ſaith, If the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Interpreters had before us tranſlated amiſs, which gave occaſion to divers Errors, muſt we (knowing the true ſignification of the Word) follow them?</p>

King <hi>Joſiah</hi> defiled <hi>Tophet,</hi> the Valley of the Son of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> that no Man might make his Son or Daughter to paſs through the fire to <hi>Moloch,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 23.10. <hi>Joſiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Carrion of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to that Valley and burnt there, that the Carrion might not annoy the City: Thither (ſaid <hi>David Chimchy</hi>) was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all the Filth and unburied Carcaſſes to be burned: The Synedrian of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for ſome Offences, ſentenced the Bodies of the Offenders to lie unburied in that Valley to burn with the Carrion caſt there, which, among the <hi>Jews,</hi> was counted a great Diſgrace; and for Offences moſt criminal they burned alive in that Valley; they ſet the Malefactor in a Dunghill up to the Knees, and put a Towel about his Neck, and one pulled it one way, and another another way, till ſtrangling him, forced him to open his Mouth, then they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0275800700:6"/>
poured ſcalding Lead into his Mouth, which went down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Body, and ſo burnt his Bowels, <hi>Talmud in Sanhedr. Per.</hi> 7. Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſent thither their Guilty to be burned in that Valley, and thoſe they buried there, they dealt with as Guilty, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 29.3.</p>
            <p>It is confeſſed by all, that Chriſt ſpeaketh and alludeth to the Jewiſh Practice in their Judicature; therefore the Places aboveſaid concern them. Secondly, The Speech of Chriſt was to the <hi>Jews</hi> by Birth and Education, they wrote the New Teſtament; and though it be penned in <hi>Greek,</hi> it ſpeaketh the Phraſe of the Jewiſh Nation: The Apoſtle ſpeaking to the Jews, uſed the word <hi>Gehenna,</hi> Jam. 3.6. Chriſt and his Diſciples uſed known Terms, that they might the better be underſtood. Thirdly, Becauſe the Jews had not Power to ſend them to the Hell they ſpeak of. 4thly. Becauſe the laſt of the three Sins is ſaid to be judged to the Fire of <hi>Gehenna</hi>; which if it were to be underſtood as ſome would have it, it will follow, that ſome Sins deſerve not Hell, and ſhall not be puniſhed there, which is contrary to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who teach, the leaſt Sin deſerves Hell. 5thly. <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.22. ſhewing the Ignorance and Severity of the Jews and Phariſees, that Anger without a Cauſe: And <hi>Racha,</hi> a word of diſgrace, which ſignifies an empty Fellow, or wicked Wretch, as great Faults as to ſay Fool, if not greater, yet puniſhed leſs; raſh Anger in danger of the Judgment; <hi>Racha</hi> in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Council; if ſay Fool, in danger of Hell-fire, to burn in the Valley of the Son of <hi>Hinnom.</hi>

            <head>Of the word <hi>Everlaſting.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Firſt, The Fire of the Valley of <hi>Tophet,</hi> is ſo called, in that it did burn Night and Day, and went not out.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The word (<hi>Ever</hi>) and (<hi>Everlaſting</hi>) the <hi>Greeks</hi> underſtand it for an Age: <hi>Ever</hi> and <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> are of a like Signification, and is uſed for a limited Time, a time during Life, <hi>He ſhall ſerve his maſter for ever, Ex.</hi> 21.6. Luke 24.46. that is, until his own or Maſter's Death; longer he could not ſerve him. The everlaſting Prieſthood, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 50.15.) was but until Chriſt came, then it was to ceaſe, as appears <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.12,13,14. It is ſaid they ſhall inherit the Land for Ever, <hi>Iſa</hi> 61.21. That Ever was but a little while, as appears <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.18.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In that Fire is durable, and goeth not out until the combuſtible Matter is conſumed, may be called Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0275800700:7"/>
and unquenchable; for the Fire that deſtroyed the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> is called <hi>eternal Fire,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (a word of a large ſignification) in that it conſumed thoſe Cities, for where no Wood is, the Fire goeth out, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 26.26.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If Fire were Everlaſting, it will not follow that which is caſt into it is Everlaſting: The Wicked are compared to Chaff and Stubble, Fire is not long conſuming them; burn the <hi>Chaff,</hi> Iſa. 5.24. If any ſay Chaff will be ever burning, and never conſumed, we know the contrary.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Conſider that the Scriptures ſometimes uſe Words that exceed their Signification, and are not ſtrictly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood according to their letter and ſignification of thoſe Words; as <hi>John</hi> 21.25. <hi>The things that Jeſus did, if they ſhould be written, I ſuppoſe the world it ſelf would not contain the things that ſhould be written.</hi> A large Expreſſion: What! will not the whole World contain a Record of the Actions of one Man?

            <p>Is it not a very ſtrange thing, that themſelves ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> word Hell is in the Hebrew <hi>Sheol,</hi> and in the Greek <hi>Haides</hi> and <hi>Gehennah,</hi> and that they are to be underſtood as aforeſaid, that they ſhould, for the ſaid Words, tranſlate it in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hell, and then expound Hell for a terrible and dreadful Place of Torment never to end! O horrible Abuſe and Blaſphemy againſt God and his Word! and even all Men are deluded and deceived thereby: Verily, verily, they deſerve the Name they give to others, of denying the Word of God.</p>

            <head>The Story of <hi>Dives,</hi> Luke 16.30.</head>
            <p>Is not any Proof of any Torments in Hell, becauſe it is a Parable, not a Hiſtory; of a Parable we are not to ground a Doctrine.

The Story of <hi>Dives</hi> is not to be underſtood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the letter, for theſe Reaſons: It ſaith, There was a rich Man in Hell, yet all confeſs the Body is in the Grave:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0275800700:8"/>2. How could <hi>Dives</hi> ſee ſo far as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom is from Hell? Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith, the great Chaos between <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dives,</hi> ſignify an infinite diſtance; which overthroweth their ſeeing and ſpeaking to each other. 3. It ſaith, he ſaw <hi>Abraham</hi>; yet they ſay, Hell is a Place of utter Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: How can any thing be ſeen in a Place of utter Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? 4. By what means can <hi>Dives</hi> know <hi>Abraham</hi> from another, ſeeing, as all confeſs, his Body is in the Grave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Reſurrection?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, How could <hi>Dives</hi> ſpeak to <hi>Abraham,</hi> his Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Grave? Can any ſpeak without the Organs of the Body?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, How ſhall <hi>Dives</hi> hear <hi>Abraham</hi> at ſo great a gulf and diſtance as Heaven is from Hell?</p>
            <p>Seventhly, How comes <hi>Dives</hi> to have ſuch Charity in Hell to his five Brethren, ſeeing he had none to them when on Earth?</p>
            <p>Eighthly, <hi>Dives</hi> would have <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſend to them, which cannot be, becauſe <hi>Abraham knoweth us not,</hi> Iſa. 63.16.</p>

            <p>This Place is no proof of Hell-torments, themſelves being Judges.

            <p>This Place is not to be underſtood of any Puniſhment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Life, becauſe it ſaith their Carcaſes ſhall lie to be ſeen, and others ſhall look upon them: In Hell they will confeſs the Carcaſes of the Wicked are not now, nor here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall be, for a Carcaſe is without Life, therefore not capable of Suffering: If they ſay, at the End of the World Soul and Body ſhall be united to ſuffer, how is it then a Carcaſe after the End of the World? How ſhall they be an abhorring to all Fleſh? For then there will be no Fleſh to go forth to look upon them. The late Annotation of the Bible on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.24. ſay, the Carcaſes are the Forces of Gog and Magog, which ſhall be ſlain near <hi>Jeruſalem, Ezek.</hi> 29.4, to 10. and 37.36. containeth, is apparent; for after the ſlaughter is made of them, they ſhall lie a long time unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and ſeven Months ſhall the Children of Iſrael be a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them, that they may cleanſe the Land, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.11,12.

To underſtand <hi>Luke</hi> 5. of their Hell, doth imply Free-will, and falling from Grace, and that ſuffering in Hell is a ſatisfaction and payment of the Debt. They will confeſs in Hell there is no Goal-Delivery, nor any Redemption, therefore it ſuits not to their purpoſe. It is conceived that Hell is deep within the Earth; Reaſon concludes it muſt needs be dark; the Grave is called the Land of Darkneſs, <hi>Job</hi> 10.21,22. the Cruelty of the Enemy is called thick Darkneſs, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.1. to 14. The Greek Poets ſay it is dark; they compare the darkneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to a certain Territory that lieth betwen <hi>Baiae</hi> and <hi>Cumae,</hi> where the <hi>Cimeria</hi> inhhabit, ſo invironed with Hills, that the Sun never came to it; whereupon the Proverb comes, <hi>Darker than the darkneſs of Cimeria</hi>: But the chief Cauſe is, becauſe they are in darkneſs without the light of the Word; for Darkneſs is in this Life: <hi>We cannot order our ſpeech by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of darkneſs,</hi> Job 38.19. Where no Light is, there is

Ignorant Men are in the Dark, and full of <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> Rom. 13.12. that would have others tormented with cruel Tortures and Death, becauſe not of their Opinion in Religion: All unconverted Men are in Darkneſs; they are of the Night, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.

               <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Bullinger,</hi> and others ſay, the <hi>Fire of Hell</hi> is material Fire, kindled with Wood, and alledge for it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.33. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.24.

            <head>The Fire of Hell cannot be Corporal Fire, for theſe Reaſons.</head>
            <p>Our Fire is corporal; they ſay our Fire is but painted Fire, a Shadow to that, therefore it is not corporal Fire.</p>
            <p>2. Corporal Elementary Fire is Light, and enlightneth the Place where it is: in Hell they ſay is utter Darkneſs; if ſo, the Fire of Hell is not corporal Fire.</p>
            <p>3. Corporal Fire conſumes ſpeedily all combuſtible Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſt into it; they ſay, the Fire of Hell ever burneth, and never conſumeth that caſt into it, therefore it is not corporal Fire.</p>
            <p>4. They ſay the Fire of Hell is inviſible, then it is not corporal, for that which is corporal may be ſeen.</p>
            <p>5. Corporal Fire may be quenched, the Fire of Hell they ſay is unquenchable, therefore it is not corporal.</p>
            <p>6. Corporal Fire goeth out without Wood, theirs not; therefore not corporal.</p>
            <p>7. They ſay the Fire of Hell is Eternal; if ſo, it is not corporal: Corporal Fire is ſeen, Things ſeen are not Eternal.</p>
            <p>8. They ſay the Abſence of God is the greateſt Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Hell; Corporal Fire is a greater Torment to the Body than the Abſence of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Corporal Fire cannot work upon a Spirit; the Devils are Spirits, therefore cannot be tormented with corporal Fire. Saith <hi>Willet, Synop.</hi> pag. 1023. To ſay God is able to make corporal Work upon a Spirit, and able to make to live without Food or Refreſhment to Eternity, and to make Fire burn without Wood, is no Proof that he will do ſo, and is as ſilly a kind of Reaſoning, as to ſay, God is able to do all Things, with God all Things are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, therefore he will do all Things; Men ſhould not build their vain Conceits upon God's Power without his Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others ſay, the Fire of Hell is not Corporal but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fire: But that it cannot be neither, for there is no ſpiritual Fire; if it ceaſes to be natural Fire, it ceaſeth to be true Fire; it cannot be ſpiritual, becauſe they ſay it is natural; it cannot be natural, becauſe they ſay it is ſpiritual; it cannot be neither of them, becauſe they ſay it is partly corporal and partly ſpiritual, the one to burn the Body, the other to burn the Soul; Hell Flames are material, yet not all material, ſaith <hi>Willet, Synop.</hi> pag. 1010. if ſo, there are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0275800700:14"/>
two Fires in Hell; <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, Fire ſhall burn thy Fleſh and a Worm thy Spirit, Conſcience accuſing, <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſaith, their Minds burn with Sorrow, and their Bodies with the Flame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Others ſay, Hell-Fire is neither material nor ſpiritual, nor mixed, but metaphorical, figurative; ſo <hi>Auſtin</hi> and ſome of the modern Preachers ſay; <hi>Calvin</hi> thinketh that there is no true Fire in Hell, for, ſaith he, the Wood and Worm is to be taken metaphorically; but, ſaith another, that the Fire is ſo to be taken, I utterly deny.</p>

            <head>Ten Opinions of the Learned, of the Places of Hell.</head>
            <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Edw. Leith, Hugo,</hi> and others ſay, Hell is a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit; but there is no Place without a Bottom which is the Earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is generally agreed, That Hell is in the lower Parts of the Earth, but where theſe lower Parts ſhould be, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> on the Creed, ſaith, No Man is able to define; the lower Parts of the Earth is great Abaſement, ſaith Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> on <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. The loweſt Degree of Chriſt's Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10. one part of the Earth is not put in Oppoſition to another Part thereof, but to Heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Thou had faſhioned me in the loweſt Parts of the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.15. Was <hi>David</hi> born in Hell?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wheatly,</hi> and others, ſay, Hell is below, but how many Miles it is to Hell they do not ſay, nor cannot tell.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Bellarmin, Lyria,</hi> and others, ſay, Hell is in the Earth near the Centre hereof; if ſo, ye may know how far it is to Hell, the Earth being round, the Circumference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being Twenty one thouſand and ſix hundred Miles: The whole conſiſting of 360 Degrees, at 60 Miles a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the Diametet of the Terreſtrial Globe is Six thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty two Miles, and one Eleventh; ſo there to the Centre or middle Point, is Three thouſand three hundred and ninety Miles and half at Length deep into the Earth to Hell; but in the Day of Judgment, when the Earth ſhall be conſumed with Fire, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. where ſhall Hell be? Then it cannot be in the Center of the Earth when there is no Earth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> and others, ſay, Hell is a Lake; the Lake is a Sea, as appears <hi>Luke</hi> 5.1,2. where the Swine were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0275800700:15"/>
choaked, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.33. whoſe common Death is not half a Mile; Men ſeek Hell in the Bottom of the Sea, becauſe they know not where to find it. Hell cannot be the Lake, becauſe Hell was caſt into the Lake, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.14.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Others ſay, Hell is in the Air, the Devil is the Prince that ruleth in the Air, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. the Air then is the Devil's Hell, ſaith <hi>Willet Synopſ.</hi> pag. 1018. if ſo, then all we that are alive are in Hell; we do find it not a Place of ſo great Torment, for almoſt all Men like it well, for there they deſire to dwell.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Others ſay, Hell is Above, near the Third Heavens, within the View of the glorious Saints, and alledge for it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.42. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.10. if ſo, it is very far to Hell: Aſtronomers ſay, that there are three Heavens above the Firmament, where the Fixed Stars are, is a Hundred and ſixteen Millions of Miles above the Earth, which is ſo high, that if a Stone or Weight ſhould fall from thence, and continue falling an hundred and fifty Miles an Hour, it would be Eighty-eight Years, two Weeks, four Days, five Hours, and twenty Minutes a falling down to the Earth.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Some ſay, the Abſence of God's Face is Hell, but that is not called <hi>Hell,</hi> but <hi>Wrath, Iſa.</hi> 54.8. This was <hi>Cain</hi>'s Puniſhment, <hi>from thy face ſhall I be hid: my puniſhment is greater than I can bear,</hi> Gen. 4.13,15. The hiding of God's Face cauſeth Sadneſs, and the breaking of the Bones of Comfort, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.81. <hi>Behold his eye-lids try the children of men,</hi> Pſal. 11.4. if ſhut they are troubled, if open they are comforted.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Some ſay, Hell is in this Life, and is a guilty accuſing Conſcience: Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> ſaith, A guilty troubled Conſcience is a Hell and Priſon of the Soul; what may rather be called Hell than Anguiſh of Soul: The Judges Tribunal is in the Soul, God ſitteth there as Judge, the Conſcience is the Accuſer, Fear is the Tormentor, Guilt in the Soul wounds the Spirit, <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Prov. 18.14. <hi>they the ſpirits in priſon,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.1,9. <hi>this is the wrath of God that abideth upon him that believeth not in the Son,</hi> John 3.16. Heaven is God's Face and Preſence, and our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Joy in this Life, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.15,16. and ſo will be the next, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Thou wilt fill me with the joy of thy face, in thy preſence is fulneſs of joy,</hi> Acts 2.18. Pleaſures or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, that is, pleaſant Joys at thy right Hand, in the full Enjoyment of thee, are ſweet Delights eternal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0275800700:16"/>Some ſay Hell is a local Place, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, it is not a Place; Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> ſaith the Place of Hell maketh not the Torments; it is a Queſtion, ſaith he, whether the Place make Hell, or the Abſence of the Preſence of God, <hi>Synopſ.</hi> Page 1056.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Another ſaith, it is in the other Side of the blue Cloud that appeareth to us in the Air; others ſay, where the Place of Hell is, they cannot tell; whether it be in the Earth or in the Water, or in the Air, it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, ſaith <hi>Greenwood</hi>; they that have taken Pains to find it out are as far from it as ever; ſome of the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> affirm, that Father <hi>Cotton,</hi> the Jeſuit did enquire of the Devil for a plain Place of Scripture to prove Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, ſo they are at as great Loſs to prove Hell by a plain Place of Scripture truly tranſlated, their Hell of Torments never to end. Alſo the learned agree not upon which Scripture to ground their Hell Torments upon; for that Place one of them alledge to prove it, another of themſelves deny it, that it is ſo to be underſtood. Mr. <hi>Ainſw.</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.16. ſaith, that Place through Cuſtom is taken for the Place of the Damned, but is not ſo to be underſtood, the Word being <hi>Sheol: Marolat</hi> on <hi>Apoc.</hi> Pag. 282. ſaith, the Fire of <hi>Gehenna</hi> is the Place of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, others of them deny it; M. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith <hi>Dives</hi> proves it, Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> and others deny it.</p>
            <p>See ye not the great Doubting and Uncertainty they are at among themſelves? They grope in the Dark with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Light, <hi>Job.</hi> 22.5. by their reeling, ſtaggering, and ſtumbling, that they are ſo drunk they can find no Ground to ſtand upon; they underſtand not whereof they affirm, yet each of them hugs his own Apprehenſion. It is very ſtrange, that in a thing ſo ſignal, of which they ſay they ſee it in the Word of God, that they can no Way agree concerning it. O ye learned in the ſeven liberal Sciences, tell us how to reconcile theſe things in Point of Truth; or tell us in as much as ye ſpeak Contraries, as yea and nay, which of you we are to believe. Have we not all cauſe to ſay herein, <hi>Where is the Scribe? where is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter of this world? hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this world,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.20. <hi>he fruſtrateth the tokens of liars, and makes diviners mad, and turneth wiſe men backward, and maketh their knowledge Fooliſhneſs,</hi> Iſaiah 44.25.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Leigh,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and Maſter of <hi>Magdalen-Hall</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> preſents his Reaſons to prove Hell-Torments or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0275800700:17"/>
Puniſhment after this Life for ſome to endure, never to End; let them be conſidered, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.17. Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith, the Conſcience of Man hath a Fear of ſome Puniſhment after this Life, proves it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If they have, that doth not prove it; becauſe the Conſcience of Men are as they are inſtructed, according to the Proverb, <hi>Such Docter, ſuch Scholar</hi>; hence it is, that the Conſcience of a Papiſt tells him it is not lawful to eat Fleſh in Lent, not of a Friday. <hi>And whoſo killeth you will think he doth God good ſervice,</hi> Joh. 16.2. that is his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the Conſciences of ſome Men are almoſt, if not altogether, for ſome Evil; therefore that proves it not.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> the Heathen, held there was a Hell, a Being and Place for wicked Men after this Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why did ye not ſay and prove, that they hold that they ſhall be in Torment never to an end.</p>
            <p>The Heathens do not believe, that there is to be ſuch a Puniſhment after this Life, for they deny the Reſurrection of the Body, therefore they burn the Body and ſave the Aſhes in an Urn for a Memorial; they believe as <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> the Philoſopher taught, that the Soui goeth from one Body into another Man or Beaſt; that ſome of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſohers grew ſo tender, that they would not kill any Beaſt nor Fowl, for they ſaid, it may be, it is my Brother or my Siſter. Theſe Heathen Greek Poets were long before the coming of Chriſt; in their <hi>treble Diviſion</hi> of the World they fain three Gods. <hi>Jupiter</hi> the God of Heaven, <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> the God of the Sea, and <hi>Pluto</hi> the God of the Earth, in which they ſay he keeps his Court and Palace, (no word of Torment, that would make it a poor Court and Palace) ſo <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Noninus,</hi> Greek Poets; <hi>Homer</hi> wrote of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> which was near a thouſand Years before the Birth of Chriſt; <hi>Homer</hi> is one of the moſt ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords extant; it ſeems in his time there was no mention of a Hell of Torments never to end, the ſaid Poets call <hi>Pluto Summanus,</hi> as being Chief of the Maunes or Spirits below: To pacify theſe ill Spirits, a feaſt was kept in <hi>Febuary</hi> with Wax Candles burning to <hi>Pluto,</hi> called <hi>Candlemas-Day,</hi> ſo Mr. <hi>Jeſ.</hi> in his Almanack, <hi>The Cretians are always liers, Titus</hi> 1.12. the greatſt liars in the World that will fancy, fain, and ſay any thing; is it a thing poſſible that Wax Candles above the Earth ſhould give Light thouſand of Miles into the Earth, to pacifie thoſe ill Spirits there? it ſeems they are not in any great Torment if a little Light
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0275800700:18"/>
will pacify them. The Poets ſay, Hell is twice as deep as Heaven is high; the Aſtronomers ſay, <hi>Jupiter</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Planet is 72 Millions of Miles above the Earth; if Hell be twice as deep, it is a hundred and fifty four Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Miles to Hell, which is <hi>fabulous</hi>; ſo there <hi>Cerberus</hi> three Heads, and <hi>Charus Boat</hi> to row Men to <hi>Pluto</hi>; ſo the Fancy of Purgatory did ſpring firſt from the Heathen Poets, long before the coming of Chriſt, as appears by <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> who have deſcribed at large the whole Common-wealth, and all the Orders and Degrees of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory: Theſe with their <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields, and many other of their Barbariſms by long Uſe became venerable.</p>
            <p>Your Opinion is fitter for Heathens than for Chriſtians: If the Heathens do hold as you do, are we to believe in Religion as the Heathen? I paſs not what they nor any elſe ſay, unleſs they can read it me in the Word of God; we cry, <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony; if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> Iſa. 8.20. Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith clear Reaſon proves it, God is juſt; many abominable Sinners enjoy more Proſperity in this Life, than thoſe that live far more innocently, muſt be puniſhed hereafter according to the Multitude and Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of their Sins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſee you are more bold to affirm, than able to prove; doth Reaſon deny the Puniſhment to be juſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it never End? The Scriptures you alledge, ſay they have an end, and you ſay, they ſhall never have an end, that is, your clear Reaſon, to ſay ſome are worſe than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, therefore they are to ſuffer a Puniſhment never to end, ſo you exclude <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and the poor Prodigal, but it is but your bare Affirmation without Proof; your Reaſon is that God ſhould ſhew Mercy to little Sinners, but none to the great Sinners, they muſt not be ſaved; but this your clear Reaſon is clear againſt the Will and Wiſdom of God, who is pleaſed to ſave of the worſt of Sinners, as appears, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Asts</hi> 9.13. If ſome enjoy more Proſperity than others, muſt they therefore ſuffer a Puniſhment never to end? Outward Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity is a great Bleſſing, and you make it a great Curſe; if that you ſay were true, there is no Cauſe <hi>in the Day of Proſperity to rejoyce,</hi> Eccl. 7.24. nor to ſay, <hi>O Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee ſend me now Proſperity,</hi> Pſalm 115.25. in ſaying greater Sinners, you judge according to outward Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both for Sin and Puniſhment, and may be miſtaken in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0275800700:19"/>
both what they are in the inner Man; for Sin and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you know not, the Heart of Unbelief and Rebellion of Spirit in others, nor how God puniſheth them in their Spirits; Sin is puniſhed in this Life.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith, 'tis juſt they ſhould ſuffer for ever, who if they had lived, would have ſinned for ever, <hi>Caſt them out of my ſight,</hi> Jer. 5.1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be juſt we ſhould ſuffer for ever, it is juſt our Surety ſhould ſuffer for ever.</p>
            <p>Do you conſider, that <hi>the Creature was made ſubject to vanity not willingly, but by reaſon of him that hath ſubjected the ſame in hope,</hi> Rom. 8.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſt them out of my ſight,</hi> is no Proof that they ſhall ſuffer for ever, but rather that they ſhall be utterly deſtroyed, for if they have any Being, wherever they be they cannot be out of Sight of God.</p>
            <p>Your Juſtice is not God's his is a Death; yours is not a Death, but another thing.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> ſaith, God's intentions from everlaſting, was to glorify his Juſtice as well as his Mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21.23. fitted to Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Know you any of the Intentions of God that is not revealed in his Word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. or doth the Word ſay that God not glorify his Juſtice, unleſs he inflict ſo great a Puniſhment without end; you give neither Scripture nor Reaſon to prove that you ſay is juſt; the Juſtice of God was revealed and made known, in cauſing the Earth to ſwallow up <hi>Corah and his Company</hi>; they <hi>were Veſſels of Wrath prepared, fitted to Deſtruction,</hi> (your Opinion denies the Word of God that ſaith they are fitted to Deſtruction) you ſay they are never to be deſtroyed, die nor end. Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith, the Covenant under which ungenerate Men ſtand, and by which they are bound over to this Wrath is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is but two Covenants, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. <hi>the old and new,</hi> Heb. 8.13. and 12.24. the old is no more ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting than the Prieſthood of it: The Breach of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works is Death, therefore not eternal Life in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith, in that Torment they curſe and accuſe one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> When you write again, I pray tell us how you know that in Hell they do ſo; for the Word of God ſaith not ſo, nor have you been there to hear it, nor they that told you ſo. To affirm things in Religion, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0275800700:20"/>
in the World of God, is to preſume above that which is written, and contrary to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Rom</hi> 15.4. <hi>Socrates</hi> an Heathen, was more wiſe and modeſt in not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming things he knew not, being asked what was done in Hell, ſaid, he never went thither, nor communed with any that came from thence: Yet you and others affirm, with great Boldneſs and Confidence, things you know not; ſome ſay in Hell the Eye is afflicted with Darkneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Darkneſs is no Affliction to the Eye; alſo they ſay their Ears are afflicted with horrible and hideous Outcries, their Noſes with Poyſons and ſtinking Smells, (of what I pray?) their Tongues with gaully Bitterneſs, the whole Body with intollerable Fire; the Damned ſhall prize a Drop of Water worth ten thouſand Worlds; curſing ſhall be their Tunes, Blaſphemies their Ditties, Lamentation their Songs, and Screeking their Strains; they ſhall lye ſcreeking and ſcream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually. Ye ſee how Men ſet their Brains to work to invent Lies; for all they ſay is without Warrant from the Word of God. One ſaith their Torments in Hell is ſo great, that they cannot forbear roaring; and you ſay they curſe and accuſe one another; ſo that one of their vain Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations contradict another, and all of them the Word of God; they will not deny that thoſe in Hell are in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Trouble, and they in leſs Trouble cannot ſpeak, <hi>I am ſo troubled I cannot ſpeak,</hi> Pſ. 17.4. therefore they cannot curſe and accuſe one another, as you affirm.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith, Divines unanimouſly concur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>They are like to concur and agree if they take the Counſel they give, as not to queſtion Principles: It ſeems we muſt take all upon Truſt, and Hearſay, without Tryal, they all ſay it, therefore it is true; but the <hi>Bereans</hi> wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Let it be certainly made to appear, that God hath ſaid in any thing contrary to any thing that I have ſaid, I deſire with all my Heart, to ſubmit to it; without that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yield the Soveraignty of my Judgment, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to the concurring Conſent of blind Guides, ignorant and erroneous Men, though in Sheeps Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and covered all over with the Title of Godly, learned and holy Saints or Presbyters, or Miniſters of Chriſt; the <hi>Papiſts</hi> call their Church Holy Church, and their Prieſt Holy Prieſt, and their Order, Holy Order, and all Holy, if you will believe them.</p>
            <p>Some ſay, the <hi>Jews</hi> report, that in <hi>Tophet,</hi> the Valley of the Son of <hi>Hinnon,</hi> there was a great Ditch which could never be filled, which they called the Mouth of Hell; and that the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> when they ſlew the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> threw them in there: If this Report be true which hath been brought to prove Hell, then it will follow, that the Mouth of Hell is near <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; and that God doth give to the Wicked, Power to caſt his People into Hell.</p>

So then it ſeems, if the Tranſlator do think the holy Ghoſt meaneth this or that he may tranſlate it ſo. Is not this a large Liberty? The <hi>Jews</hi> take on ſuch Liberty.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters of <hi>Lincoln</hi> Dioceſs, in the Abridgment of their Grievances delivered to King <hi>James.</hi> page 11.13.14. ſay, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation of the Bible, is a Tranſlation that takes away from the Text, and adds to the Text, and that ſometimes to the changing and obſcuring of the holy Ghoſt; and Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> the great Linguiſt in his Advertiſement of Corruption, tells the Biſhops, that the publick Tranſlation of the Scriptures in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> is ſuch, as that it perverts the Text of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in eight hundred forty and eight Places, and that it cauſeth Millions to reject the old Teſtament; and Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> Dr. of Divinity, in his <hi>Dipper Dipt,</hi> page 1. ſaith, no Tranſlation is ſimply authentical, or the undoubted Word of God. In the undoubted Word of God there can be no Error, but in the Tranſlation, there are and may be Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; the Bible tranſlated therefore is not the undoubted Word of God, but ſo far only as it agreeth with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, the Writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles; and in as much as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation, as he ſaith, is not the undoubted Word of God, what is that Preaching worth that is proved by it? The falſe Gloſſes and Interpretations which are put upon the Scriptures by Men learned in the Languages, who have made inconſiderate and bold Aſſertions without Proof, in not keeping the true and proper Signification of the Words thereof, hath cauſed many
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0275800700:25"/>
Errors, and great Trouble and Confuſion; they put the Word <hi>Lucifer</hi> for the Day-ſtar, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.12. They have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Fountain, and digged to themſelves Ciſterns, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. And we ſee the People are willing to give up themſelves to a Miniſtry of Fables, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. that makes the Scriptures ſay and unſay, which being interpreted is to make them ſay juſt nothing; the Force of Education and the Cuſtom the Country-men live in, is ſuch as ordinarily ingageth them to a Prejudice and evil Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion againſt all Principles contrary thereunto, though of divine Inſpiration. Hence the <hi>Papiſts, Turks</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sorts of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> cry down and cenſure each others Judgment and Opinion as abominable Error, Hereſy and Blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>The third Pillar that upholds Hells Torments are fond Expoſitors that interpret <hi>Sheol</hi> for Hell Torments, ſo Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> calls them in his Defence, page 90. I would know why Interpreters underſtand and tranſlate a Hell of Torments from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> as is not in them, as themſelves confeſs, as hath been ſhewed: They will take <hi>Sheol</hi> figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and ſay by <hi>Tophet</hi> Hell is figured, which is a Fancy, a Fable and Deluſion that is ſtrong in many that expound Scripture without Senſe or Reaſon; it is as improper to interpret <hi>Sheol</hi> for a Place of Torment, as to interpret the Word Houſe to ſignify a Horſe. The Scripture is not of private Interpretation; a Senſe ariſing out of the Brain of an Interpreter is a private Interpretation, and as the Scriptures are not of Man but of the holy Spirit; ſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of them is not to be of Man but of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Oracles ſignify the Anſwer of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. ſee <hi>Job</hi> 12. <hi>and how readeſt thou,</hi> Luke 10.26. to interpret Words figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively that are to be underſtood literally, and Words lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally that are to be underſtood figuratively, is licencious and deſtructive to the Faith of the Goſpel; we are not to interpret any Place figuratively, unleſs that figurative Senſe be expreſſed in a plainer Place of Scripture; if a Man will have an erroneous Perſwaſion whatſoever the Scripture ſaith to the contrary, he will have it to be a figurative Senſe, they will be left in the Clouds of their own Perſwaſion; ſo inſtead of proving their Hell of Torments never to end by the Scriptures, <hi>Ruffinus</hi> and others ſay, they that will not believe it ſhall ſeal it; which is no Proof, but a meer Shift, as very a lie as Nurſes uſe to ſtill Children by telling them of a great Bulbegger, and that a Man will come down the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0275800700:26"/>
Chimney and carry him away; but not any but Children and Fools will be ſcared with ſuch Bulbeggers.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Pillar that upholds their Hell Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the Conſent of their Preachers, their learned and godly Men agree herein, but their weak, and various, and uncertain Grounds, declare, that they have not ſtudied the Point; but when Teachers and Hearers are ignorant, any thing will ſerve and paſs for Truth; the ſimple believe every Word; All ſorts of Prieſts agree and abuſe the People; the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Prieſts blow a Powder into their Eyes that comes to ſee <hi>Mahomet</hi> hang, that maketh them quite blind, that for ever after they are led, and the Prieſts ſay that the Glory of the Sight of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> is ſo great, that it taketh away their ſight for ever after; and about <hi>Eaſter</hi> time, for ten Days there is great Joy about a great fire for their Prieſt <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and thoſe that caſt themſelves into the Fire and are burnt to Death are counted Martyrs; and once a Year the Tomb of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> is carried a broad upon a cart, and his Prieſts ſay, that thoſe that put themſelves under the Wheel of that Cart and are cruſhed to Death, they ſay to dye Martyrs, and ſome are ſo Simple to do ſo, that ſo they may dye Martyrs, ſo the Antichriſtian-Prieſts and all ſorts of Prieſts have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deluded and deceived the People, blowing ſomething into their Ears that for ever after they are not able to here and receive the Truth. But as M. <hi>Beza</hi> did deteſt the Papiſts Limbus and Purgatory, ſo do I their Dreams of Hell, it being a device of Man without Scripture, with all their uncertain Brain ſick Fancies, for the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Men have no end.</p>
            <p>The 5th Pillar of Hell is their wreſting the Scripture to uphold their Hell of Torments; this cozeneth and deceives many under Colour of Divine Authority, when it's but Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, though they are not pleaſed publickly to ſay ſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſtreams not to their Purpoſe, the Scriptures they alledge to prove, is about conſidered; if any ſay I wreſt Scripture, I appeal to the Learned in the Languages, for to them concerneth the Deciſion of the Signification of Words, who (as I have ſhewed) teſtifie with me.</p>
            <p>The ſixth Pillar of Hell is their Arguments and Reaſons they bring to prove Hell Torments; which have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh Pillar of Hell is a ſtrong Perſwaſion that is in Men, that the believing Hell Torments is a great Means
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0275800700:27"/>
to leave Sin and to live a holy Life; and the not believing Hell Torments is a Means to commit all Sin with Greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to live as they liſt; for, they ſay, Men live as though there were no Hell.</p>
            <p>Carnal Hearts of Men taken Offence of every thing, except the Law of Works, doing to be ſaved, the Doctrine of Election, God's free Grace and Salvation only and alone by Chriſt, without Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. is changed to be one of the greateſt Doctrines of Liberty to ſin that ever was, and is by the Ignorant made a Stumbling-block and Rock of Offence; and a Cauſe of Careleſneſs in many. <hi>Ludovick</hi> ſaid, if I be ſaved, I be ſaved, If I be damned, I be damned; the Papiſts ſay, if good Works ſave us not, to what Purpoſe ſhall we do them? Then we may live as we liſt, if we be appointed to Life we ſhall be ſaved, though we Sin never ſo much, <hi>if we ſin we have an Advocate,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1. <hi>not any thing can ſeparate us from the love of God,</hi> Rom. 8. If we be not appointed to Life, we cannot be ſaved, though we ſhould do never ſo much good, yea ſee how this truth is turned to Wantonneſs, the Apoſtles exhort not to turn this grace of God into Wantonneſs, Rom. 6.1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>15. The corrupt Heart of Man is ready to do it; there are many things in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle, which the Ignorant Unlearned (that know not God in Chriſt) wreſt to their own Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; will any therefore ſay, that the Doctrine of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Salvation by Chriſt alone is not a Doctrine fit to be taught not come abroad? if ſo, the Scriptutes muſt not come abroad.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Doctrine of the Proteſtant Miniſters is charged, not only to be a Doctrine of Liberty to Sin, but a blaſphemous Doctrine, to teach that the Fall and Sin of Man was decreed, they ſay is to make God the Author of Evil; the Proteſtant Writers ſay, that the Sin of Man was determined of God; Dr. <hi>Willet, Synop.</hi> pag. 760. He alſo ſaith, the Proteſtants hold, that the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was both foreſeen of God and decreed to be, not permitted only, they alledge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.5.8.2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>Acts</hi> 4.22.28. <hi>ſhould ungodly luſts, Judg.</hi> 18. for the Creature was made ſubject to Vanity, not willingly, but by Reaſon of him that had ſubjected the ſame in Hope, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.20. Dr. <hi>William Whitaker</hi> againſt <hi>Campion</hi> the Jeſuit ſaith, now anſwer me <hi>Campion,</hi> do you think that which any one doth, how wicked ſoever, is done whether God will or no? If you hold that any thing is done againſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0275800700:28"/>
God's Will, what Providence or Omnipotency do you leave him? For he that permitteth that to be done which he would by no Means have to be done, it is certain, that he is not endued with ſo great Power, as that he can forbid that which he would not have done, wherefore you muſt needs confeſs, that all Things that are done are done by the Will of God; and Pag. 196. all confeſs, God could have hindered Sin to be if he had ſo pleaſed, but he would not hinder it, therefore it was his will it ſhould be, the Will of God, and not Sin, is the Cauſe of God's Decree, and the being of all things; the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God is the Womb from whence ſpringeth every Work of the Creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. God muſt firſt will his Creature to ſtand or fall before he can do either, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.4. the evil Actions of Men are not only foreſeen of God, but decreed, ſaith Mr. <hi>Par</hi> in hie Grounds of Divinity; we are not ſaved from ſin, except we have committed Sin; therefore Salvation from Sin is not without committing Sin, ſaith <hi>Fulk,</hi> pag. 121. God willed and decreed his Glory and Man's Happineſs; therefore he willed and decreed the Means to it: The end and moving Cauſe of his willing Sin to be, is for his Glory, which Cauſe it was neceſſary for Sin to be; if Sin had not been, how ſhould the Goodneſs of God in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man Eternal Life in Glory appeared, his Love in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt to die? If there had not been Sin, there had been no need of Chriſt's comming, nor of his Death and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; moſt of the great Works of God in this World and that to come, have Dependance or Reference to Sin; how ſhould we have lived by Faith, exerciſed the Fruits of the Spirit, or have any Happineſs or Glory in the World to come, if it had not been for Chriſt? And Chriſt had not been, if there had been no Sin: He that willeth the End, willeth thoſe things that are neceſſarily referr'd to that End, Taking away Sin was decreed before the World, therefore the Being of Sin was decreed; Chriſt's Death was determined before the World; for the End of Chriſt was to reſtore <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall. If <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, there had been no need of a Chriſt to reſtore him: The Saints were choſen to Life before the World; Choice hath Reference to the Fall, therefore the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was decreed: If the Will of Man had been the firſt and chief Cauſe of the being of Sin, then the Will of Man ſhould be the Cauſe of God's Will, and ſo Men ſhould be the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0275800700:29"/>
original Cauſe of the Salvation of himſelf, and ſo much the Cauſe of it, that without his will it could not have been: and ſo the Determination of God what to do, ſhall not be from himſelf, but from the Will of Man, which is contrary to <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. if Men ſhould will Sin before God willed it, then ſhall the Will of God depend and wait upon the Will of Man: as if God ſhould ſay, If Man will Sin, then I will his Salvation: And if God ſhould firſt will to ſend Chriſt to ſave Man, and leave it to Mans Will and Power whether he ſhall fall or no, then it was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible for Man to ſtand, and ſo to fruſtrate the Decree of God: For if Man had not ſinned, God's Decree of ſending Chriſt had been void and of none Effect: Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, God Decree the fall of <hi>Adam</hi>; if the fall was decreed, if Man had Power to Stand, then he had Power to fruſtrate God's Decree, which no wiſe Man will affirm; and then that ſaying that <hi>Adam</hi> had Power to keep the Law, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out truth; if he had, conſider <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.2,3,4. <hi>Je.</hi> 3.29,36. God willeth all things well, he ſinneth not, nor can Sin, becauſe he is under no Law, God commands Men to keep the Law, that no Man can do; he commands Men to think no vain Thoughts, and not to ſin; we cannot but think ſome vain Thoughts, and in many Things we Sin all Chriſt ſaith, <hi>No man can come to me except the Father draw him,</hi> John 6.44.37. if they be drawn they come; <hi>draw us and we will run after thee,</hi> Cant. 1.4. if I put ſufficient Strength to move the Earth, Motion muſt needs follow; when Men ſin they are beguiled, enticed, deceived, drawn away, <hi>they like men have tranſgreſſed,</hi> Hoſ. 6.7.</p>
            <p>We are to diſtinguiſh between that which followeth a Doctrine in its own Nature, and that which followeth by Accident, or rather that a corrupt Heart draweth from it, and is not from the Nature and Working of the Doctrine it ſelf; it is ſtrange to conſider Men are to ſet upon the Popiſh Principle to be ſaved for their Works, that they count all Prophaneſs that croſſeth their Way; ſome have burned the Bible; and Doctor <hi>Criſp</hi>'s Book of Salvation by Chriſt alone, Mr. <hi>Archers</hi> late of <hi>Allhallowes London,</hi> his Treatiſe of Comfort to beleivers, againſt their Sins and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, was burnt by the Hangman; the ſame Spirit is alive to burn this alſo. I expect no better from ſuch as are not taught of God; they condemn thoſe Things they know not, and think they do God Service, when they perſecute the Truth and Profeſſors of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0275800700:30"/>Take for Inſtance, that the Fear of the Torments of Hell is no ſuch Preſerver againſt Sin, is evident; for thoſe that ſin with the greateſt Greedineſs, the greateſt Sinners, they do believe there are Hell Torments? For tho' they be never ſo wicked, they hope it doth not belong to them; or they hope to repent and lead new Lives, before they die; though they ſin for the preſent, they hope to make God amends for all, as an <hi>Arminian</hi> being drunk, ſaith, that he was now in the State of Damnation, but he ſaid he would be in the State of Grace to morrow, ſo he comforted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Lives of many Heathens that have denied the Reſurrection of the Body, and therefore did not hold a Hell of Torment after, have been better than many that ſeek to eſcape Hell, and get Heaven by their Works.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Fear of Hell were a Preſerver againſt Sin, then thoſe that are delivered from the Fear of Hell, that believe they ſhall be ſaved, they ſhould Sin more than others; but we find the contrary, that none more free from Sin than theſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Experience teacheth, that the Fear of Hell, though at firſt it ſtartleth and frighteth Men, yet that is ſoon over, and is no Preſerver againſt Sin.

I knew another wiſhed the Devil to take him Soul and Body, if he did not do the thing he ſpake of, and I knew he did it not: Another wiſhed he might ſink into Hell preſently if he did the thing he ſpake of, yet did do it before he went from the Place; the Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Luſts of Men are ſtronger than the Fear of Hell, Reſolutions and Curſes.</p>

            <head>Several Conſiderations that there is not to be a Puniſhment after this Life, that ſhall never end.</head>
            <p n="1">1. We do not find the Place of Hell mentioned in any of the ſix Days Work of God; if it be a Place, it is a created Place, and ſo a Part of the Creation of God, the Whale is mentioned in Scripture; if there be a Place of Hell, it is a greater thing, and in that it is not found in the Creation of God, it is a Ground to judge that it is of the Creation of Man, a vain Imagination of Man; for their Reaſons prove it not, nor do they agree amongſt themſelves of the Proof of it, neither where it is, nor what it is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Solomon</hi> [was wiſer than all Men] 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.36. yet he ſpake not any thing of the Torments of Hell, nor of any Puniſhment never to end [he ſpake from the Cedar to the Hyſop, he ſpake alſo of Beaſts and Fouls, of creeping

things, and of Fiſhes] v. 33. if he had known of any Hell and Torments there, he would have ſpoken of that alſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Jews,</hi> [unto whom were committed the Oracles of God] <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. to give unto us, they have delivered no ſuch thing to us, nor do they believe any ſuch thing; for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors underſtand the ſeventh Day of ſeven thouſand Years which is in the World to come he bleſſed, becauſe in the ſeven thouſand Years all Souls ſhall be bound up in the Bundle of Life in the World to come; <hi>Aiſnworth</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>a Day with the Lord is as a thouſand years,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.8. the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, as the World was made in ſix Days, ſo it ſhould continue ſix thouſand Years, and no more; and that the ſeventh Day in the ſeven thouſand Years in the World to come, in which all Souls ſhall be bleſſed: Alſo they ſay a good Man and a bad Man died afterwards: One in a Viſion ſaw the good Man walking in Gardens among pleaſant Fountains of Water, but the bad Man near a River, and his Tongue reaching after Water, but could not reach it. <hi>Talm.</hi> Jeruſ. in <hi>Chag.</hi> fol. 77. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. in that theſe things are received among them for Truth, though they be but <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Fables, yet by them we ſee evidently that they do not believe the Opinion of a Torment after this Life never to end. The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors were great Searchers of every Tittle of Scriptures; and if it had been there to be ſeen, they or their Prophets ſhould have ſeen it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Saints recorded in Scripture did not believe that there was to be a Puniſhment for any to endure never to end; this appeareth, becauſe when they made a Confeſſion of Sin, and the Puniſhment due to them for the ſame, they do not confeſs to have deſerv'd any ſuch Puniſhment; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs [to us belongs confuſion of Face] <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.8.11.

            <p>Nor do we find that they did ever give Thanks for any ſuch Deliverance, if they had known of any ſuch Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it could not but appear the greateſt Deliverance any could enjoy, and that it did require the greateſt Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and Thankfulneſs; nor doth it appear that ever they did pray for, or expreſs any Deſire of any ſuch Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; in that they expreſs neither, it is a Ground to judge that they knew of no ſuch Puniſhment; and if there had been any ſuch Deliverance, they ſhould have known it, I ſhould not have been hid from them; they admired the

Deliverance of ſaving their Lives from Death, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Deliverance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.13,14. [the Kindneſs of the Lord not to Die] 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.14.</p>
            <p>Do you believe that if <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had believed that there was ſo great and exceeding Torment without end, that in the leaſt they would have wiſhed or deſired [to be raced out of the Book of Life] <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.33. and [to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Chriſt] <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. to endure the ſaid Torment without end? I do not believe that they were willing ſo to ſuffer.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Chriſt when on Earth, ſpoke of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which was to come, and wept becauſe they were to ſuffer that, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42,44. he would much more have ſpoken of a Puniſhment never to end, and wept for them that ſhould ſuffer that, if there had been any Puniſhment for any to endure.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Becauſe when God doth warn any from Sin, from the Conſideration of Puniſhment, there is no mention of any Puniſhments but of thoſe in this Life. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1. to 11. [they ſhall die of grievous Deaths] <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.4,2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 19.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14.

            <p n="7">7. Becauſe God's Puniſhment of Sin is not of ſo large an extent as his Mercy, for his puniſhing of Sin is but [to the third and fourth Generation] <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.9.

               </gap> is ſatisfied therewith, and requireth not a further Puniſhment? God doth puniſh Sin in the Sinner and upon his Children, to the third and fourth Generation, but becauſe there is not to be a Puniſhment after this Life never to end. 8. Becauſe Death and the fear of it is call'd the [Terror of God] <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.3. the King of Terrors, <hi>Job.</hi> 8.11,14. therefore Death is the greateſt Puniſhment and more terrible; but if there were to be a Puniſhment ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to end, nor Death, but that were the King of Terrors; for is not terrible at all in Compariſon of that. 9.

            <p n="10">10. Becauſe there is not a worſe thing then the Dregs of God's Fury, Anger, and Wrath; and theſe are poured out in this Life; God doth not only begin to puniſh Sin in this Life; but alſo finiſh it in this Life; for it is ſaid, <hi>He poured out all his fierce Anger, he caſt upon them the fierceneſs of his anger, wrath and indignation,</hi> Pſal. 78.49.

Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> ſaith, If <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, he could not have conveyed to us a Body immortal, or not dying, in his Treatiſe of Heaven, Page 131. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, if God had given <hi>Adam</hi> an immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unchangeable Nature, he had created a God and not a <hi>Man. Auguſtine,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Confeſſions</hi> ſaith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord created a Man of nothing, therefore he left in Man a Poſſibility to return into nothing, if he obeyed not the Will of his Maker.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Man in Innocency needed Food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that which depends upon mutable and earthly Things, is earthly and mutable; we ſee it in all other Creatures that live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on periſhing things, at laſt periſh; and herein Man by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> hath no Preeminence above a Beaſt: Heaven
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0275800700:38"/>
and Earth were created, therefore had a Beginning; and although they have a much longer Life than Man, are to have an end, (Heaven and Earth ſhall be diſſolved) 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> had not died, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. he ſhould have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this World, he ſhould not have gone to the World to come; therefore by his Fall he loſt no Happineſs nor eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life in that World; for he could not by that Fall loſe more than he had, and was to have. Death is according to Nature, but to attain Immortality is above Nature. <hi>Adam</hi> being Earth and from the Earth, his Enjoyment, Life, and Loſs, and Puniſhment, muſt, of neceſſity, be earthly; how cometh he then by his Fall to be capable of a Puniſhment never to end, unleſs by his Fall he could purchaſe eternal Life, which none will affirm? Eternal Life cannot be by the firſt Man, much leſs by Sin.</p>
            <p>I deny not but the <hi>wages of ſin is death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. There is difference to be put between a natural Death and a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Death; the firſt is from nature, the ſecond is from Sin, if the common Death that all die, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. were the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin, as moſt Men think, then Chriſt, by freeing his from the Puniſhment of Sin, by bearing Death for them, of Neceſſity he muſt free them from dying a natural Death, but Chriſt freeth not his from a natural Death, yet freeth them from the Puniſhment of Sin; therefore to die the common Death is no Part of the Puniſhment of Sin: For where Sin is ſatisfied, or pardoned, or forgiven, the Puniſhment is not inflicted; if it be, how is it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given? Even Men when they pardon inflict not the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; all confeſs, ſome Mens Sins are pardoned, how then cometh it to paſs that they die for Sin, whoſe Sin is pardoned? (He that keepeth my ſaying ſhall not ſee Death) <hi>John</hi> 15.21. is not to be referred to a natural Death, but to periſh, a judicial Death, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. the Scripture declares, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Dead, the Juſt and Unjuſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.15. the Unjuſt would enter into Life, but ſhall not, <hi>John</hi> 5.20. (Unto whom I ſwore in my Wrath, that they ſhould not enter into my Reſt) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.7. (and your ſelves thruſt out) <hi>Luke</hi> 13.28. when they riſe to Judgment at the laſt Day, they ſhall be conſumed with the Earth by Fire, that's their End; ſo that not to enter, to be thruſt out, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death, and to periſh, is one thing, if they live for ever, and have eternal Life, how do they periſh? and how

A legal Death is not from Nature, but from Sin, and is a Second Death; if a Man for Murder be put to Death, in dying he dieth the firſt and ſecond Death; for in dying he dieth a natural Death, and a judicial Death: This later is a ſecond Death, in that it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Men put the Streſs of the Puniſhment of Sin upon the ſecond Death, but what that ſecond Death is, they cannot agree among themſelves; the Miniſters in their late An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations on the Bible on <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.9.

               </gap>pretation it is not a Puniſhment never to end. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith the ſecond Death is a total Separation from God; if ſo it is not a Puniſhment without End, and in that God is every where, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7,8. if they be any where, how are they abſent from God?</p>
            <p>If the ſecond Death be a Death, it is not a Life of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery never to end; that is not a Death, unleſs eternal Life be a Death; they confeſs eternal Life in Miſery is worſe than Death; if ſo, then it is not a Death but another thing.</p>
            <p>The firſt Death is the Deſtruction of the Body, a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Soul and Body; the ſecond Death muſt be like it; the ſecond Death is an Image of the firſt, elſe how is it a Death, and a ſecond Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

with the ſecond Death) by which it appears, the <hi>Jews</hi> count the ſecond Death) is to be ſlain; and, if ſo, it is not a Life of Miſery never to end, as ſome ſay, the Book of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> ſpeaks of the ſecond Death. Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> and others ſay, that Book treats of the Church and things done in this World; and if ſo, then the ſecond Death is a Puniſhment of this Life; they alſo interpret Heaven in that Book to be the Church, and the late An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations on the Bible, and Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> and others on <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.10. ſay, that the Devil in that Place is the great <hi>Turk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is their Opinion that ſay, the Wages of Sin is not Death; they ſay it is a Life of Miſery never to end, which is worſe and more than Death; therefore their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is contrary to the Word that ſaith, it is Death, filled with all Unrighteouſneſs, haters of God, deſpiteful, proud, Inventers of evil things, they that commit ſuch things are worthy of Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31,32. theſe are great Sinners, yet the Word ſaith, not that they are worthy of more then Death; and therefore why ſhould any ſay they are worth of more then Death; And if the End of theſe things are Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. therefore there is not any thing to come after Death, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.4. the Soul that Sinneth ſhall die, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.14,26. that is all that Sin doth bring forth. God in giving his Law, did expreſs the Puniſhment of the Breach of it, ſaying, in the Day that thou eateſt of that Tree, thou ſhalt ſurely die, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. dying thou ſhalt do, that is, naturally and judiciouſly, not touch it left ye die, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.3. to bear Iniquity is to dye for it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 22.9. <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.22. that one Man die for the People, <hi>John</hi> 18.14. the Body is dead becauſe of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. he that is dead is freed from Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.7. neither Sin nor Puniſhment hath any thing to do with a dead Man. This Iniquity ſhall not be purged from ye till ye die, then it is purged from them; if this Iniquity be purged from you till ye die, we learn that Death ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitteth, <hi>Talm. Jerus, Sanched,</hi> Fol. 27. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>After Man had ſinned, God expounded the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Breach of his Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.14. to v. 20. It is evident, that the Puniſhment of the old Serpent the Devil, and of the Woman, and of the Man for their Sin, are only Puniſhments of this Life; there is not the leaſt Word of any puniſhment after this Life, much leſs of a Puniſhment never to end; ſo that by that which is ſaid
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0275800700:41"/>
we may judge of that Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> and others ſay, of being everlaſtingly in a red-hot ſcorching Fire, deprived of all Poſſibility of dying, or of being ever conſumed in Torment eternally; they ſay the Fire of Hell burneth far hotter than ten thouſand Rivers of Brimſtone; how know they it, ſeeing they never felt it, nor they that told you ſo? Three drops of Brimſtone will make one ſo full of Torment that one cannot forbear roaring out for Pain, yet it muſt be born ſo long as God is God. O Eternity, Eternity, Eternity! If ſo, they ſhall have Eternal Life, which is contrary to the Scripture, as hath been ſhewed, and is therefore to be rejected; alſo they ſay that the Soul of the Wicked goes immediately at Death to Hell, to the Devil, contrary to <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.21. and 12.7. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9 <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.13,14,15. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.9. if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are in Hell in Torment, as they commonly and vainly imagine: Hell is in the Wicked; the Devil's evil Spirits are there, and rule there in the Children of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.28. <hi>Jud.</hi> 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.29,30,31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency being a natural Man, he had the Law of Nature written in his Heart; the Breach of that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law cauſed a temporal Curſe and Puniſhment, and not any Eternal; they that think eternal Life is to be had for our Works, our well doing, are prone to think eternal Life may be loſt for our not well doing; but the Way of the Goſpel places not eternal Life and eternal Death in Miſery upon our doing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2,3,4,5. Alſo the Scripture ſpeaketh not of an eternal Death, and therefore there is no ſuch thing.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>Proof</hi> III. Their Opinion of a Puniſhment after this Life never to end, makes not Sin, but Chriſt to be the Cauſe of their ſo ſuffering: This is evident; becauſe if Chriſt had not come, there had been no Reſurrection, and if no Reſurrection there could be no ſuffering of any Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after this Life: For if no Reſurrection they ſhould have periſhed, in the Grave their had been their End. If Chriſt be not riſen, they which are fallen aſleep are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17,18. that the Reſurrection came by Jeſus Chriſt is alſo evident; for Chriſt ſaith, I am the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>John</hi> 11.75. By Man, that is, Chriſt, came the Reſurrection, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. [Therefore it is called the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt] 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. [His Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection]
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0275800700:42"/>
               <hi>Romans</hi> 6.5. <hi>Philippians</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Chriſt is called the Firſt-fruits, becauſe he firſt roſe from the Dead, after him others; if Chriſt had not riſen, no Man ſhould ever have riſen from the Dead, therefore it is ſaid, [They came out of his Graves after their Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection] <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.5. and in that Chriſt is the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Cauſe of it, in that it came by him, ſure none will deny, that if there had been no Reſurrection from the Dead, there could be no Suffering after Death, ſo long as God is God, therefore it follows, if any Man ſhall ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, Chriſt is the Cauſe of it: for without him they could not have lived for ever, and therefore not ſuffer for ever; and is it not very hard and unreaſonable, and contrary to the Word, to charge Chriſt to be the Cauſe of their ſo Suffering? ſeeing Chriſt came [in love to the World] <hi>John</hi> 16.36. [to ſave, not to deſtroy] <hi>Luke</hi> 9.59. and 9.10. not to make any miſerable, [he came to ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners] 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. [he roſe again for our ſatisfaction; therefore, if none can ſo ſuffer unleſs Chriſt be the Cauſe of it, there is no ſuch Puniſhment for any to endure never to end.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>Proof</hi> IV. The Scriptures declare what Chriſt came to do, namely, to deliver us from the hand of our Enemies, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74. [to taſte Death for every Man] <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. See <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. [the laſt Enemy is Death] he aboliſhed Death] 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. he hath promiſed Deliverance from Death and Grave; I will redeem thee from Death, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.14. that keeps my Sayings ſhall not ſee Death, <hi>John</hi> 8.51,52. O Death where is thy Sting, O Grave where is thy Victory? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. I will ranſom thee from the Power of the Grave; he ſaith not from the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, nor from the Puniſhment never to end: O Death I will be thy Plagues, O Grave I will be thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.4. ſo that if there be a Puniſhment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death and Grave, there is no mention of Chriſt's deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering us from that; and in that the Scripture ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith, [He is able to ſave from Death] <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. is as much as to ſay, Salvation from Death is ſufficient, and that there is no farther thing to be delivered from than Death and Grave, if there were deliverance from them had not been ſatisfactory, becauſe not ſufficient; for if there is to be a Puniſhment after Death, who ſhall deliver us from that? Chriſt delivereth from Death and Grave; no further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0275800700:43"/>
from any thing is mentioned; therefore he hath not delivered his from more, and therefore there is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to be delivered from; ſo that ye may ſee that their Opinion makes void Chriſt's Suffering, and the Saints Comfort! for if a Puniſhment for ever be due to Man for Sin, Chriſt muſt for ever ſuffer that Torment to free us from it, or we muſt ſuffer it. The Proteſtant Writers confeſs, that the Way and Means that Chriſt freeth us from the Puniſhment of Sin, is by his Suffering that Puniſhment we were to ſuffer: To this the Scriptures agree, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4,5,6,7. ſo that if Chriſt, our Surety, hath not ſuffered the ſaid Torments for ever, then hath not Chriſt ſuffered enough; namely, that which we were to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and ſo not delivered us from the ſaid Puniſhment. That Jeſus Chriſt hath not ſo ſuffered is evident, and confeſſed by the Proteſtant Writers; ſome of the Proteſtants ſay, the Rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e in that Place, they will not ſay Chriſt is now in; if Chriſt had ſuffered the Pains of the Damned, yet unleſs he ſuffer them without end, Chriſt ſuffered not the Puniſhment of the Damned in Hell, which they ſay we were to ſuffer; alſo they ſay, they ſuffer not thoſe Torments without Sin and Deſperation? Will any ſay Chriſt ſo ſuffered alſo? They ſay, in Hell they ſhall ſee the Story of their Sins before their Eyes, the Wrath of God lying upon them for their Sins, cruel Indignation, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Outcries, Blaſphemies, fretting for horrible Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, endleſs Pains, without all Hope or Comfort; Who dare ſay Chriſt ſuffered any of theſe? Some that are for the Torments of Hell, confeſs that it ſtands not with the Dignity and Worthineſs of Chriſt's Perſon, nor with the Holineſs of his Nature, nor the Dignity of his Office to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0275800700:44"/>
ſuffer in that local Place eternally: final Rejection with Deſperation, with the Worm of Conſcience, agreeth not to the Holineſs of his Perſon; final Rejection Chriſt ſuffered not, nor eternal Flames, nor the ſecond Death: For Chriſt to ſuffer theſe, were to deſtroy the Work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Chriſt could not be ſubject to Deſtruction. <hi>Willet Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopſ.</hi> Page 1009. Chriſt ſuffered none of theſe Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, therefore, he ſuffered not the Torments of Hell. <hi>Chriſt was heard in that he feared.

Chriſt not deliver us from any thing which he ſuffered not, eternal Fire in Hell: He ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not; nor are the Pains of this Life the Pains of Hell; therefore if there be any ſuch Hell or Puniſhment, Chriſt ſuffered it not, and therefore we muſt ſuffer it; ſee ye not whither this their Doctrine tends? To overthrow the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Chriſt's Suffering and our Comfort, in leaving us to ſuffer the ſaid Torments ourſelves. <hi>Chriſt leaving his ſuffering an example, if we ſuffer with him,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8.17. Muſt we ſuffer the Torments of Hell? I believe Chriſt hath born the whole Puniſhment of Sin; in it I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and deſire no more; but how Chriſt ſuffered the Torments of Hell, I, nor themſelves ſee not: They ſay, Chriſt being God, made an infinite Satisfaction, paying at once upon the Croſs, that which we ſhould have been ever a paying: I grant Chriſt is God; but the Godhead did not, nor could not ſuffer; if the Godhead of Chriſt was to make ſatisfaction to God, is to ſay, God ſatisfieth God; and if Chriſt as God was to make ſatisfaction, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was Chriſt to be made Man and die? If ye ſay Chriſt was to make ſatisfaction in both, his Godhead and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, doth the Godhead need the help of the Manhood to make ſatisfaction? It is not proper to ſay, God was to be ſatisfied, for God was never unſatisfied; God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, infinite, happy, unchangeable; How is he ſo, if he were ever unſatisfied? To ſay God is, or ever was unſatisfied, is in effect to deny the Being of God, to ſay, he is not happy; for Satisfaction and Content be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Happineſs; where there is no Satisfaction, there is no Content, becauſe no Perfection; <hi>God is one to us, there is but one God; God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.

Man is finite, ſo is all he doth, <hi>Sin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> Sin is a Diſorder of the Creatures firſt and chief Being, which ſtands in Righteouſneſs, and is an Eclipſe of the Glory of Man. Sin is a Defect and Diſcovery of the Weakneſs and Mutability of the reaſonable Creature; Sin cannot impeach God; <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doeſt thou againſt him? Or if thy righteouſneſs be multiplied, what doeſt thou unto him? If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou unto him, or what receiveth he at thy hand?

ſtrict Senſe, is to attribute too much to Sin, and too little to God, to give that to Sin which is proper to God; to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Sin with God, is in effect to deny the Being of God, becauſe there can be but one infinite; alſo to ſay Sin is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, is to make all Sin alike equal, for there is no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in that which is infinite; Sin not being infinite, needs not an infinite Satisfaction: They ſay infinite Majeſty of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, infinite Puniſhment oppoſed: but it's but their ſay ſo, becauſe it is without and beſides the Word of God: The Puniſhment of Sin is not to be taken from the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, but from the Penalty expreſſed in his Law for the Breach of it, which is Death, <hi>Geneſis.</hi> 3.3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proof.</hi> V. The Word ſaith, God's <hi>fury is like fire; in the fire of his jealouſie he ſhall make a ſpeedy riddance of all them in the day of the Lords wrath,</hi> Ezek. 1.18. but to continue in Torment for ever, is no ſpeedy <hi>Riddance</hi>: therefore there is no ſuch Puniſhment to be: The pouring out of the fiery Anger of the Lord, <hi>is a day,</hi> Zeph. 1.15.18. Rom. 6.17. Ezek. 13.14. and 22.22. James 2.21. Iſa. 13.9.13. <hi>the day of the Lord is at hand.</hi> Deut. 32.34,35. Job 20.28, a Puniſhment never to end, no ways agrees to <hi>a day</hi>: Therefore there is no ſuch puniſhment to be.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>Proof</hi> VI. The Opinion of the Torments of Hell never to end, hath and doth daily cauſe much Sin: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, It cauſeth Fear: <hi>Fear hath puniſhment,</hi> 1 John 4.8. <hi>He that feareth is not perfect in love,</hi> 1 John 4.18. a ſervile and a ſlaviſh Fear is Sin.</p>
            <p>2. It cauſeth many evil and hard Thoughts of God.</p>
            <p>3. Fear troubleth the Hearts of many of the Lord's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and makes them ſad with their Lyes; this God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.22. <hi>their lies cauſe them to err, after which their Fathers walked, Amos</hi> 2.4. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Let not your Hearts be troubled,</hi> John 14.1. the fear of Hell doeth greatly trouble the Hearts of many; it is Gods Will to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the ſad, to releaſe thoſe that are bound, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1,2.3,4. and 40.5,9. <hi>a word fitly ſpoken, is like apples of Gold in pictures in Silver,</hi> Prov. 25.11.</p>
            <p>4. Fear diſtracts, and greatly diſcourageth the Soul, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Faith; that which freeth the Soul from Fear, fits the Soul to ſerve <hi>God without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs, all the days of our lives,</hi> Luke 1.74.</p>
            <p>5. Fear unfits and diſableth the Soul to every good Work to God or Man: Fear unfits for any outward occaſion: Fear is a weight that depreſſes the Soul, and makes it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0275800700:47"/>
weak, it ſtraitneth the Heart; but Hope comforteth and enlargeth it.</p>
            <p>The Opinion of Hell Torments, provokes the Soul to envy and Unbelief, and hinders Subjection to God; if the Soul apprehends it ſelf liable to ſo great and everlaſting Puniſhment, it cannot ſubmit to God (nor be quiet.) This cauſed <hi>Francis Spira</hi> to wiſh he were above God; The Light of this Truth cauſeth the Soul leſs to ſin, and leſs to be troubled, to have leſs hard Thoughts of God, and leſs to fret againſt the Lord.</p>
            <p>7. Their Opinion cauſes an exceeding and unreaſonable trouble of Mind and melancholy; ſuch Trouble is Sin, <hi>John</hi> 13.1. [a merry heart doeth good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.22,] the Knowledge of the Truth herein eaſeth the fearful Mind, and cauſes, as it were, a Heaven upon Earth.</p>
            <p>8. Their Opinion hath cauſed many to murder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in taking away their own Lives by Poyſon, Stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, Drowning, Hanging, Strangling and Shooting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, caſting themſelves out of Windows, and from high Places to break their Necks, and by other Deaths, that they might not live to encreaſe their Sin, and encreaſe their Torments in Hell.</p>
            <p>9. Their Opinion provoketh to the greateſt Sins, as Deſpair: Alſo to the Wickedneſs that the World lieth in, namely, working for Life, to do Duties to eſcape Hell and get Heaven, which is to <hi>tread under foot the blood of Chriſt as an unholy thing,</hi> Heb. 10.29. in ſeeking to be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law of Works, and not alone by the perfect Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10,14.</p>
            <p>10. Freedom from Fear cauſeth Love; Love cauſeth Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtraineth</hi>; it tends to the Comfort of many that through Weakneſs of Faith give way to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Temptations; to fear the Torments of Hell cauſeth a feeble Mind; <hi>comfort the feeble mind,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.14. Its a comfort to many whoſe Children and Friends die and leave no Teſtimony of their Converſion, the Fear that they are to ſuffer ſo great and endleſs Torment hath great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſadded and troubled the Heart of many a Parent and Friend.</p>

            <p n="8">
               <hi>Proof</hi> VIII. It is not agreeable to the God of Nature, to go contrary to the Law of Nature, that he hath written in Mankind; there is planted in Man an univerſal Love to Man, eſpecially to their Off-ſpring, be they obedient or diſobedient; what Bowels of Love is there in Parents to their Off-ſpring, when in Miſery, and to others in Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Want? Sure no Man doth deſire any Man nor Creature to indure the Torment they ſpeak of one Year, much leſs their own Off-ſpring; how then may I, or can I, think ſo of God, to be leſs pitiful, leſs merciful then cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Man, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 50.24. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.1.) to his Off-ſpring? we are all his Off-ſpring, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. ſure God exceeds Man in Goodneſs; if ye which are evil know how to give good things to your Children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give good Things to them that ask him? <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.8,9,10,11. Thou Lord art good and doeſt good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.68. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45. though they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and did evil, God did good and gave Rain, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. They ſay the Fire, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.21. is nothing to Hell, and that the greateſt Torment Man can deviſe, is ſcarce a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to that in Hell, by which they declare God to be more cruel than Man.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <hi>Proof</hi> IX. If Man had deſerved ſo great puniſhment, why may not God ſhew that mercy as not to inflict it, as well as to let his Sun to ſhine, and his Rain to fall on them that no way deſerve it, ſeeing he could (if he ſo pleaſed) hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it? we do ſee Men ſhew more kindneſs to a rebellious and diſobedient Child then he deſerveth; may not God do the ſame, ſo much as God is greater than Man, ſo much greater is his Mercy, Love, and Goodneſs, than that in Man, yea than that that is or ever was in all Men; all that came from him, and all is but the leaſt drop to that great Sea and Ocean of Mercy and Love that is in him; how little a portion is heard of him? <hi>Job.</hi> 24.14. All Nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him leſs than nothing, Vanity, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40.12,15,17,

Becauſe God's general Goodneſs in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World is to all his Creatures, and alſo in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſpenſation is towards, and for the whole Univerſe of Mankind; he hath provided room enough for all Men and Creatures, and all good things for all; the profit of the Earth is for all, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.9. God hath commanded us to do good to all, he that hath two Coats is to impart to him that hath none, and he that hath Meat muſt do ſo likewiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.11. all which doth hold forth God's good Will and Care to Mankind, he that would not have them ſuffer the Torment of Miſery and Want, that taketh care to prevent that little and ſhort Miſery, will not impoſe a far greater never to end.</p>

               <hi>Proof</hi> XI. Their Opinion leſſeneth the Goodneſs of God, and limiteth to a few, whereas the Scripture declares it to be to all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. The Creature it ſelf ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Bondage of Corruption, into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19.

from their Bondage, for which deliverance they groan: are not all Angels and Men, obedient or diſobedient, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of God? if ſo, the worſt ſhall partake of the liberty of the Sons of God: as the whole Creation came from God, or rather is in God, for in him we live, it ſhall be taken up into the ſame Glory, a good the larger it is the better, if it be good to ſhew Mercy to ſome, is it not more good to have mercy on all? <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Plato</hi> could ſay, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſupreme Good, there was no Envy in him to any of his Creatures, but rather a deſire that all might be made like him: This is ſo great and glorious a diſcovery of God, and that all Men are in God; for in him we live, and move, and have our being, as certain alſo of your own Poets have ſaid, for we are all his off-ſpring, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. I have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred how the Heathen Poets came to know this Truth, ſure God did manifeſt it to them: If all Men are in God, all Men are in Chriſt; for Chriſt ſaith, [I and my Father are one] <hi>John</hi> 10.30 Alſo if all Men are in God, for in him we live and move, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if ſo, then all Men are in Chriſt; for God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9.

            <p n="12">

He that is turned to the Lord is one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. God is in them of a truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Chriſt in us, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Stephen</hi> when ſtoned, cryed [Lord

Such Torment, of ſuch continuance, in the laſt agree not to the gracious mind and merciful heart of a Saint; he deſires not any Man nor Creature to be in ſuch Torment an Hour: therefore it doth no way agree to the Mind of God: we find the more the Lord manifeſts himſelf in any, the more their Minds and Spirit are humb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="13">
               <hi>Proof</hi> XIII. Such Torments do not in the leaſt agree to the Mind and Will of Chriſt; Chriſt is full of Love and Mercy to the worſt Men; it was truly ſaid of Chriſt [He was a friend to Publicans and Sinners] He, the beſt friend to them that ever was; when they crucified him, he ſaid [Father forgive them] <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. When the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples would have had Fire to come down from Heaven to conſume Chriſt's Enemies, he rebuked them, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.54. He that will by no means ſuffer his Enemies to ſuffer a ſhort Death by Fire, will not inflict upon them a more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Fire never to end; ye may know the mind of God by the mind of Chriſt, for Chriſt is God, alike equal, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. and as one [I and my Father are one] <hi>John</hi> 10.30.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <hi>Proof</hi> XIV.

[The words of the pure are pleaſant words] <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.25. good words, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable words; the holy Spirit is called a Comforter, not a Tormenter, the pure Spirit of Love ſends forth only Love and Sweetneſs.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <hi>Proof</hi> XV. No ſuch torment no way agrees to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God; God is Love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.16. it is his nature, there is no anger nor fury in love; fury is not in me, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.4. God wills us to love enemies that abuſe, wrong and hate us; God will do ſo much more, love his enemies, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.35. If God ſhould only love them that love him,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0275800700:52"/>
do not the Publicans the ſame? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.46. All that is in God is God, as infinite; God is love, love is infinite without bounds and limits; though we in our ſhallowneſs and narrowneſs, have often ſet bounds and limits to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs; there was never any beginning in God, therefore no beginning of his love; the infinite bleſſed God is one and ever the ſame; I am the Lord, I change not, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.6. This love delights in mercy and love, and not in puniſhing of Sin: That is his ſtrange act, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.21. Chriſt died to anſwer the Law we broke.</p>
            <p>Chriſt did not purchaſe the love of God; he loved us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World began, and ever will, <hi>John</hi> 13.1. God was never without his love, nor is ever out of that love; Chriſt ſaith, thou haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me, <hi>John</hi> 17.23. at what ſhall God be angry or unſatisfied? for God was never angry with Chriſt nor his People, nor at the being of Sin, nor at Chriſt taking our Sins upon him; for he laid them on him, the iniquity of us all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6.</p>
            <p n="16">
               <hi>Proof</hi> XVI.

paſs over tranſgreſſion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.11. it is for the glory of God to do ſo much more: God made all things, and doth all things for his glory; he ſeeketh his glory in his exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatneſs and riches of his grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.7. it is more for his glory to ſave all, then to ſave a few; the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. ſin could not hinder <hi>Manaſſes, Mary Magdalen,</hi> perſecutors and wicked prodigals to find mercy: I cannot admit to think any thing that is cruel to be in God in love, whoſe goodneſs is unſearchable, paſt finding out, far above all we can ask or think: there is ſuch a confuſed noiſe among men of the grace and love of God, ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral voices that we are in confuſion, and know not what to make of it: look above and hearken to the ſweet voice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove in the Region of love, what is the voice in Heaven, they agree in one, there is no voice comes from Heaven but love, peace, and good will to man; let men ſay what they will, I reſt ſatisfied in the voice above, that is only a voice of love and good will; its enough to ſatisfie any in this doubt: and ſuddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly Hoſts praiſing God, and ſaying, glory be to the higheſt, on earth peace, and good will to men, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.13,14. not only to ſome men, but to all people, <hi>v.</hi> 10. this is glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings indeed, good news from Heaven, the beſt news that ever was, that God hath good will to men; there is no ill will, all is good will to men; this cauſeth peace and praiſe, glory be to the higheſt for his ſweet peace and good will to men, to all people.</p>
            <p>Concluſion; in reading the Scriptures we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any text in ſuch ſenſe as is not plain in Scriptures, or contrary to Scriptures, or contrary to the Law of nature, or againſt the general Goodneſs of God to Mankind, or to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Goodneſs of God, or contrary to the gracious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and mercifulneſs of a Saint, or contrary to the mind of Chriſt which he declared when on Earth, or contrary to the fruits of the bleſſed Spirit, the nature of the Love, Goodneſs, and Mercy of God; or that ſhall tend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict or leſſen the glory of God, or leſſen the greatneſs and riches of his grace; for it is not to be imagined that God who is only wiſe ſhould do and teach contrary things.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, from hence ariſe no inconveniency to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, nor is it any diſhonour to God, nor any grief, nor hinders
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0275800700:55"/>
faith and love in any good man, nor any diſcouragement to any in ſerving of God, that there is not to be a puniſhment for any to endure that ſhall never end. There is not any thing more plain than that which hath been ſaid to him that will agree to truth; ſome will not agree to any thing, though never ſo plain and certain, if contrary to the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Fathers; this, their way is their folly, and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity approve their ſayings, Pſal. 49.13.
