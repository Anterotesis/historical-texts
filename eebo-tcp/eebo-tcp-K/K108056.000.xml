            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouriſt kept himſelf ſnug while a number of Literary Iriſhmen in London and Dublin were claiming the praiſe due to him, which indeed they have continued to do to this hour, though the pleaſant fugitive is now well known to be the offspring of the facetious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

From the repeated panegyrics in the impartial Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don News-papers, we were taught to expect the ſight of an heavenly Angel, but how were we ſupernaturally ſurpriſed into the moſt awful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at beholding a mortal Goddeſs!</p>
            <p>The houſe was crowded with hundreds more than it could hold, with thouſands of admiring ſpectators that went away without a ſight. This extraordinary Phaenomenon of Tragic excellence! this Star of Melpomene! this Comet of the Stage! this Sun of the firmament of the Muſes! this Moon of blank verſe! this Queen and Princeſs of tears! this Donnellan of the poiſoned bowl! this Empreſs <hi>Ruſty Fuſty</hi> of the piſtol and dagger! this Chao of

Shakeſpeare! this World of weeping clouds! this Juno of commanding aſpect! this Terpſichore of the curtain and ſcenes! this Proſerpine of fire and earthquake! this Katterfelto of wonders, exceeded expectation, went beyond belief, and ſoared above all the powers of deſcription! She was Nature itſelf!—She was the moſt exquiſite work of art! She was the very daiſy, primroſe, tube-roſe, ſweet-briar, ſurze-bloſſom, gilliflower, wall-flower, cauliflower, auricula, and roſemary; in ſhort, ſhe was the Bouquet of Parnaſſus!</p>
            <p>Where expectation was raiſed ſo high, it was thought ſhe would be injured by her appearance— but it was the audience who were injured. Several fainted even before the curtain drew up!—but when ſhe came to the ſcene of parting with her. wedding-ring, ah! what a ſight was there! The very ſidiers in the Orcheſtra, albeit, unuſed to melting mood, blubbered like hungry children crying for their bread and butter; and when the bell rang for muſic between the acts, the tears ran from the baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon player's eyes in ſuch plentiful ſhowers, that they choaked the finger ſtops, and making a ſpout of the inſtrument, poured in ſuch a torrent on the firſt fidler's book, that not ſeeing the Overture was in two ſharps, the leader of the band actually played in one flat.</p>
            <p>But the ſobs and ſighs of the groaning audience, and the noiſe of the corks drawn from the ſmelling-bottles, prevented the miſtake between the flats and the ſharps being diſcovered.</p>
            <p>One hundred and nine ladies fainted! forty-ſix went into fits! and ninety-five had ſtrong hyſterics! The world will ſcarcely credit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0106400500:5"/>
were actually drowned in the inundation of tears that flowed from the galleries, lattices, and boxes, to encreaſe the briny pond in the pit. The water was three feet deep, and the people that were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſtand upon the benches, were in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition up to their ankles in tears!</p>
            <p>An Act of Parliament againſt her playing any more will certainly paſs, for ſhe has infected all the Volunteers, and they ſit reading the Fatal Marriage, crying and roaring the whole morning, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſeeing this Giant's Cauſeway, this Salmon Leap of wonders at night! An addreſs has been preſented to the good Earl of Charlemont by the principal Volunteers, and backed by Doctor Quin and the Faculty of Dublin, praying him to ſtay at home the evening of her appearance, elſe they are convinced ſhe'll tear his infirm frame in pieces with her terrific ſcreams, when ſhe's dragged from the corpſe of Biron, and they'll loſe the greateſt General that ever headed an army. Nature, muſt aſſuredly, in one of her bountiful moments, in one of her charitable and humane leiſure hours, in one of her ſmiling days, in one of her happy weeping months, and in one of her all-ſorrowing gladſome years, made this human lump of clayey perfection!</p>
            <p>Oh! happy Hibernia, bleſſed Ierne, ſanctified land of Saints, what a hearſe load, what a coffin full, what a church-yard tree of the brighteſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of excellencies now ſtands on the turf of thy fruitful earth!</p>

            <p>O thou univerſal Genius, what pity it is that thy talents are ſo confined to Tragedy alone! No age— nay, the Roman Theatre, the Stage at Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple—Nero himſelf never performed the ſcene of madneſs, of grief, of joy, of woe, of diſtreſs, of ſorrow, and of pity, ſo well as Mrs. Siddons!</p>
