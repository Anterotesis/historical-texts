            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is now full ſeven months ſince the following curious Epiſtle was advertiſed in the public papers, and its ſpeedy publication pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. We were then told alſo, that the occaſion of it was a late infamous attack on the character of the Gentleman to whom it is addreſſed.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Morning Chronicle of July 25, 1772.</note> The length of time which has ſince elapſed, and that Gentleman's giving up his own cauſe, naturally gave room to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the delivery of a mountain, ſo long in labor with a mouſe, would be thought ridiculouſly ſuperfluous. The ingenious author, however, of <hi>"The Powers of the Pen—The Curate—Methodiſt and Converſation, Price Two and Sixpence each."</hi> could not reſiſt the powerful temptation of adding another <hi>two-ſhilling</hi> ſprig to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bays. Hence, after a truce declared, and the field of battle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, ſteps forth this reverend champion, to renew the fight, and ſlay the ſlain. Unhappily for him, the diſturbance he has thus given their aſhes, ſeems to have provoked their ghoſts to ſeek an avenger in the perſon of that learned commentator Scriblerius Flagellarius; who makes no other apology for the <hi>inſignificancy</hi> of his <hi>Comment,</hi> than the <hi>inanity</hi> of the <hi>Text;</hi> taking refuge under the old adage: <hi>Ex nihilo, nihil fit.</hi> Some apology, indeed, may ſeem neceſſary for ſupperadding a copy of the Parſon's text whole and entire; and would be really ſo, were it the property of the publiſher. But, as we find the original is printed on the author's own account, and he might ſuffer more in his reputation, by our printing only mutilated extracts of his performance, than he would in his pocket from our printing the whole, we thought ourſelves bound in juſtice to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his fame, as an author, to his profit, as a bookſeller. At the ſame time we held it incumbent on us, in juſtice to the publick, to ſet a leſs price on the Text and Comment together, than he has done on the Text alone: becauſe, admitting, as above, the inanity or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs of both, we know, as adepts in Algebra, that negative quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities added together produce a ſum ſo much the leſs in <hi>value</hi> as the <hi>co-efficients</hi> encreaſe in <hi>number.</hi> Modeſty, however, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced us to value our Comment at but half the price of the Text, we have ſtated the value of both together at a fourth leſs; agreeable to calculation; 
for − 2 <hi>x</hi> added to − <hi>x</hi> is = to − 3 <hi>x</hi> = to eighteen-pence. Q. E. D</p>

                        <head>ARGUMENT OF THE TEXT.</head>
                        <p>As in the phyſical or natural world the ſun cheriſhes alike both weeds and flowers, ſo in the world of letters the ſun of learning ſhines alike, both on the ſcholar and the dunce, on the genius and the blockhead. [From the beginning to line 22.] Many and great are the evils which have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this promiſcuous diſpenſation of natural and literary bleſſings. [l. 22 to 27.] According to the wiſdom of ages, and the laws of nature, it is a received maxim, that oppoſites attract oppoſites; as FAIRNES; <hi>Foulneſs,</hi> and ſo forth. The depth of Heaven's deſign in this is left to be ſounded by the metaphyſicians. [l. 27—36.] Facts alone are abided by, and the waſps, worms and flies, that prey upon our peaches and pears, are ſhewn to be a natural evil, and a vile blunder in the ſyſtem of Providence. [l. 36—38.] The world of <hi>letters</hi> is ſtill more <hi>prepoſterous</hi> than that of <hi>nature;</hi> dunces and blockheads conſtantly hunting down men of parts and genius. [l. 58 to 64.] Thus that old Grub and miniſterial penſioner, the author of the <hi>Falſe Alarm</hi> [hight <hi>Dr. Sam. Johnſon</hi>] endeavoured to hunt down the well-known JUNIUS. [l. 64—100.] And thus muſt thou, immortal <hi>Roſcius,</hi> favoured by all the nine, expect to be hunted up and down. Nor canſt thou repine, while revelling in the embraces of the <hi>coy</hi> maids, at being
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1064601200:4"/>ſubject to the hiſſing of the ſnakes of Envy. [l. 100—134.] While Envy's fever burns, the raving bard, Bavius, with venomed heart, paints the vileſt crime, in vileſt words, in the vileſt rhime; [that is the author of <hi>Leap-Frog,</hi> hight — <hi>Shirley,</hi> Eſq.] toſſes up St. Paul's, and ſets it topſy-turvey on its golden croſs. It is thus he turns every thing arſey-verſey; even putting the all-ſeeing eye of Heaven into the blind eye of a glow-worm's tail. It is thus he makes Biſhop Lowth a blockhead—Dan Shakeſpeare unnatural—Orator Pitt a ſtammerer, and thou, great Roſcius, a tootheſs old oyſter-woman! [l. 134—153.] Wouldſt thou be pleaſed that, when a future Plutarch [probably meaning Parſon W—s, author of as curious a proſe Epiſtle to D. G. Eſq.] ſhall uſher thee into the temple of Fame, he ſhould damn thy reputation, by placing Bavius [author of <hi>Leap-Frog</hi>] in the next niche, as thy friend? [l. 153—167.] And yet Candour will excuſe even <hi>Bavius,</hi> upon coolly reflecting on the preſent ſtrange topſey-turvey ſtate of nature; for, though formerly bulls butted with their horns, and aſſes kicked with their heels; man, bird and beaſt each following the dictates of nature; it is now quite otherwiſe; Bavius, the aſs, inſtead of lifting his heel, kicking us with his head. [l. 167—185.] Yet thou, immaculate Roſcius, need'ſt fear nothing, not even a legion of devils, with their Captain Satan, or their Lieutenant-Captain Mendax, at their head, being poſſeſſed of conſcious innocence and the impenetrable ſhield of VIRTUE. [l. 185—203.] Thou haſt nothing to do but to liſten to my <hi>numerous, melodious</hi> and <hi>nectareous</hi> verſe; which flows to give Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaean reſt to that perturbed ſpirit in thy breaſt; which, ſecured by virtue and innocence, does nothing but laugh and ſing; while guilt can never be lulled to reſt, though by a Welch harp, ſtrung with the harmonious locks of Apollo. [l. 203—227.] It is pleaſant to ſee repulſed the feeble attacks of that Grubſtreet-laureate, <hi>Zoilus,</hi> author of <hi>Love-in-the-Suds</hi> [hight Dr. <hi>Kenrick</hi>] monarch of Fleet-ditch, and Uſurper of the throne of Cloacina; whoſe cleanly revenues he receives, like another Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, from the hands of ſcavengers. [227—275.]</p>

                           <p>Thou art the ſun, to whom the fly was once ſent ambaſſador, from the inſects, who could not bear thy meridian glory. Thou ſcorcheſt the eyes of literary gnats, theatric beetles and be-doctor'd bats; darklings, obſcene, dim children of the night, who club their malice to execrate thy light; being unable to ſhine, till thou art retired behind the ſcenes, in "Thetis' lap to reſt."

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1064601200:5"/>Line 20. The <hi>curioſa felicitas,</hi> or happy choice of words, and chaſtity of metaphor, for which our reverend author is ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed, begin already to manifeſt themſelves.
<q>
                  <l>So that bright ſun, prime <hi>nouriſher</hi> of wit,</l>
                  <l>Which <hi>burns</hi> in Burke, in Lyttelton and Pitt.</l>
               </q> This is the firſt time, we believe, that the <hi>flaming brightneſs</hi> or <hi>burning heat</hi> of the ſun, has been miſtaken for that <hi>genial warmth</hi> by which it <hi>nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes</hi> either fruits or flowers.</p>
            <p>It is with peculiar propriety alſo that our reverend bard has particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized the great patriot Mr. Pitt, as one of thoſe on whom the <hi>ſun of learning</hi> has ſo beneficently ſhone. The profundity of this great patriot's erudition, indeed, appears to ſingular advantage in his literary produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which, to uſe the juſt diſtinction of Lord Pomfret, are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the liberal ſtyle of a <hi>gentleman,</hi> and not with that grammatic propriety which betrays the vulgar pen of a literary mechanick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1064601200:6"/>Line 24. What a pity! To be ſure, it is a great evil that the ſun ſhines alike on the wiſe and the fooliſh; "on the juſt and the unjuſt." It is to be hoped the next time our wiſe Parſon gets into the pulpit, he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge this blunder from the ſacred text, and correct ſuch a groſs error in the laws of nature.</p>
            <p>Line 34. In what book of Proverbs, or by what law of nature, the bard has made this diſcovery, we are at a loſs to gueſs. Ariſtotle in his Ethics tells us, <hi>Semper ſimilem ducit deus ad ſimilem;</hi> and again, to uſe his own words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. In the proverbial ſayings of all ages and countries, we ſhall find alſo, that "<hi>like</hi> loves <hi>like.</hi>" "Birds of a feather flock together," &amp;c. <hi>Fairneſs</hi> and <hi>Foulneſs</hi> therefore are <hi>repulſive</hi> and not <hi>attractive;</hi> things homogeneous only attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other; agreeably to the true ſyſtem of the Newtonian philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. The truth of the matter ſeems to be this: the Parſon had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where read
<q>
                  <l>Envy will Merit as its ſhade purſue.</l>
               </q>
But then the poet adds
<q>
                  <l>It like a ſhadow proves the ſubſtance true.</l>
               </q> Becauſe there can be no ſhadow without a ſubſtance; but then our ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Maſter of Arts</hi> forgot that the <hi>ſhadow</hi> bears a reſemblance to the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and does not differ from it as <hi>foul</hi> doth from <hi>fair;</hi> as this divine poet, or rather <hi>poetical divine,</hi> has above ſo roundly aſſerted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1064601200:7"/>Line 42. What elegance of imagery do we find in this deſcription of Pomona, fruitful mother, Autumn's queen; repreſented here, as ſpreading her vegetable petticoats, the vine or the fig-leaf, to preſerve her mellow cluſters, from the depredation of thoſe deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate banditti the waſps, whom he ſatirizes ſo wittily and ſeverely for their immoral and ſcandalous behaviour in being before-hand with him in the robbery of orchards.</p>
            <p>Line 47. We ſhould be glad to know, why our poet, on whom the <hi>ſun of learning</hi> hath doubtleſs deigned to ſhine, as well as on Burke, Lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telton and Pitt, hath here added the plural cloſe, common to Engliſh words, to that of <hi>Banditti,</hi> as if its ending in <hi>s</hi> were neceſſary to make it plural. The ſingular of Banditti, in Engliſh, is <hi>Bandit,</hi> from the French, or <hi>Banditto,</hi> from the Italian. Thus Milton.
<q>
                  <l>No ſavage fierce <hi>Bandit,</hi> or mountaineer.</l>
               </q>
And Shakeſpeare,
<q>
                  <l>A Roman ſworder, and <hi>Banditto</hi> ſlave.</l>
               </q> But perhaps our learned Maſter of Arts might, by <hi>Banditties,</hi> mean a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of different companies, or ruffian bands of Banditti: but a band and a Bandit are different words. The author's ignorance, therefore, is obvious; the word <hi>Banditti</hi> being never uſed as a noun of multitude in the ſingular number, and therefore cannot be made plural, like <hi>band,</hi> or other Engliſh words, by the uſual termination in <hi>s.</hi> What a pretty Maſter of Arts! Really, friend Evan, you ſhould be ſent to ſchool again, to con your accidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1064601200:8"/>Line 48. For "Waſps, who <hi>ſing"</hi>—we ſhould certainly read "Waſps who <hi>ſting.</hi> "—Of <hi>ſtinging</hi> waſps we have heard: but of <hi>ſinging</hi> waſps never. This we ſhould have thought an errour of the preſs, but for the reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned in the next note.</p>
            <p>Line 50. Our author ſeems to entertain a violent reſentment, if not a rooted antipathy, againſt the whole <hi>ferae naturae.</hi> We ſhould, however be glad to know by whom, according to his ſyſtem of religion and morals, they were laid under any moral obligation, and to whom they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable.
<q>
                  <l>The downy peach, the bloom-ſuffuſed plumb,</l>
               </q>
that <hi>bloom-ſuffuſed</hi> is a happy epithet!
<q>
                  <l>Proclaim their wrongs with bleeding mouths, tho' dumb.</l>
               </q> From a dumb mouth muſt certainly proceed a ſilent proclamation; which muſt, of courſe, alſo, be juſt as curious as intelligible. Our poet ſeems, indeed, here to be as good a naturaliſt as he is a moraliſt and divine: but as we, <hi>Scriblerius Vapularius,</hi> are ſtrangers to the phyſical ſenſation and moral ſentiment of vegetables, we are at a loſs to gueſs at his meaning, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, philoſophical, or moral.</p>
            <p>Line 60. What a happy diſcovery, and how worthy a proteſtant divine, that the ſyſtem of Providence is a <hi>prepoſterous</hi> ſyſtem! It is no wonder,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1064601200:9"/>if he found ſuch abſurdity prevail in the ſyſtem of <hi>nature,</hi> that he ſhould find more in a ſyſtem of <hi>art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Line 62. This crime of <hi>being bright</hi> is certainly a very capital one, though it is not likely our author will ever be found guilty of it.</p>
            <p>Line 64. By this rhyme of <hi>offence</hi> and <hi>defence,</hi> it ſeems as if our poet had entered into a league offenſive and defenſive againſt Engliſh verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Line 68. We have heard of book-worms, natural and metaphorical, but they are ſuch as <hi>devour</hi> books, inſtead of reading them. As to a <hi>ſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> worm, we never heard of ſuch a reptile either in the natural or lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſyſtem. Our author's ſpelling worm appears alſo to be, at the ſame time, a mere garden grub, who cankers the laurels of the poet, while he is ſpelling his verſes.</p>
            <p>Line 72. The chief grub having, undergone its metamorphoſis, is now become a caterpillar. We find, however, that his transformation is but partial; he being ſtill famed for <hi>long words</hi> and <hi>pedantry.</hi> This is the firſt time we have known a <hi>caterpillar</hi> reproached with the uſe of the <hi>ſeſquipedàlia.</hi> Had our poet called Dr. Johnſon, the perſon here alluded to, a caterpillar or grub-worm <hi>critic,</hi> the metaphor would have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: but he cannot be at once a human hog and a hog-horſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:1064601200:10"/>Line 76. Theſe thouſand feet would be applicable enough to the critic, conſidered as a <hi>millepedes,</hi> or wood-louſe, inſtead of a worm, or caterpillar; though it be whimſical to think an inſect ſhould carry ſpurs on its feet, to goad itſelf. As the text ſtands, however, our Maſter of Arts ſeems ſo learned a naturaliſt, as not to know a grub from an earwig.</p>
            <p>Line 85. We ſhall leave the Doctors Cadogan, Hill, and Ingram, to decide whether ſnails can be afflicted with the gout or not; and if not to ſome future critic to diſcuſs the propriety of this epithet. But we, muſt not omit to obſerve that, for want of grammatical conſtruction, in theſe two lines,
<q>
                  <l>Onward he crawleth, like a gouty ſnail,</l>
                  <l>Cowards to fight, or felons to a jail,</l>
               </q> The laſt is downright nonſenſe; unleſs the poet meant to make ſenſe of half of it, by ſaying he crawleth to fight cowards; for which, by the way, he does not ſeem to have occaſion for a thouſand feet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1064601200:11"/>Line 95. We never heard that the Apoſtle, or any Saint of the name of <hi>James;</hi> kept his court, or was ſurrounded with a brilliant cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle at his levee. Our poetical parſon muſt certainly mean, therefore, the brilliant circle in the drawing-room or preſence-chamber, at <hi>St. James's;</hi> ſo that the above lines, inſtead of running as above, ſhould be corrected, and ſtand as under,
<q>
                  <l>When in the brilliant circle of St. James's</l>
                  <l>Amelia's beauties ſet the court in <hi>flames's.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Line 100. Query, Doth the poet mean that Nature hath given but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflies power only to ſtain their mealy wings? or to ſtain any thing elſe <hi>with,</hi> or by means of, their mealy wings? If the former, he has written nonſenſe; if the latter, falſe grammar.</p>
            <p>Line 106. The muſes claſping the genius of Roſcius, and his ſhining Parnaſſus' pride without a waſp, is ſomething beautifully metaphorical, if it were but intelligible. It is pity that <hi>claſp</hi> and <hi>waſp</hi> are not the beſt of rhimes. <hi>Raſp</hi> or <hi>haſp</hi> would have mended the <hi>ſound</hi> and could not have marred the <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1064601200:12"/>Line 112. This revelling in the ſavour of the nine, muſt be attended alſo with a ſingular kind of beatitude; eſpecially if the maids are ſtill ſo coy as to confine their ſavours to a ſimple kiſs. And yet this, perhaps, is as much as he ought to wiſh for; ſince, though he might poſſibly be able to deflower, he could never ſatisfactorily enjoy them.</p>
            <p>Line 115, Of Roſcius's ſwimming on a ſea of glory, one may form ſome idea, by ſeeing the buoy at the Nore ride over the waves, at all times of the tide; or to adapt more properly my ſimile to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by ſeeing the float of a fiſhing-line dance upon the ſurface of the water, till ſome gudgeon bite at the hook.
