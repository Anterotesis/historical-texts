            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>THE GENERAL PREFACE.</head>
               <p>TRadition has in no Inſtance ſo clearly evinced her Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as in the tranſmitting of vulgar Rites and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Opinions.</p>
               <p>Of theſe, when we are deſirous of tracing them backwards to their Origin, many loſe themſelves in Antiquity.</p>
               <p>They have indeed travelled down to us through a long Succeſſion of Years, and the greateſt part of them, it is not improbable, will be of perpetual Obſervation: for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men look back with ſuperſtitious Veneration on the Ages of their Forefathers: and Authorities, that are grey with Time, ſeldom fail of commanding thoſe filial Honours, claimed even by the Appearance of hoary old Age.</p>
               <p>Many of theſe it muſt be confeſſed are mutilated, and, as in the Remains of antient Statuary, the Parts of not a few of them have been awkwardly tranſpoſed: they preſerve, however, the principal <hi>Traits,</hi> that diſtinguiſhed them in their origin.</p>
               <p>Things, compoſed of ſuch flimſy Materials as the Fancies of a Multitude, do not ſeem calculated for a long Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tion; yet have theſe ſurvived Shocks, by which even Empires have been overthrown, and preſerved at leaſt ſome <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi> of Identity, during a Repetition of Changes, both in religious Opinions, and in the Polity of States.</p>
               <p>But the ſtrongeſt Proof of their remote Antiquity, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they have outlived the general Knowledge of the very Cauſes that gave riſe to them.</p>
               <p>The Reader will find in the ſubſequent pages an union of Endeavours to reſcue many of theſe Cauſes from Oblivion. If, on the Inveſtigation, they appear to any ſo frivolous as not to have deſerved the Pains of the Search, the humble Labourers will avoid Cenſure, by incurring Contempt.</p>
               <p>How trivial ſoever ſuch an Enquiry may ſeem to ſome, yet all muſt be informed that it is attended with no ſmall ſhare of Difficulty and Toil.</p>
               <p>A Paſſage is to be forced through a Wilderneſs intricate and entangled: few Veſtiges of former Labours can be found
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0324300200:3"/>
to direct us; we muſt oftentimes trace a tedious retroſpective Courſe, perhaps to return at laſt weary and unſatisfied, from the making of Reſearches, fruitleſs as thoſe of ſome antient enthuſiaſtic Traveller, who ranging the barren <hi>African</hi> Sands, had in vain attempted to inveſtigate the hidden Sources of the <hi>Nile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rugged and narrow as this Walk of Study may ſeem to many, yet <hi>Fancy</hi> (who ſhares with <hi>Hope</hi> the pleaſing Office of brightening a Paſſage through every <hi>Route</hi> of human Endeavour) opens from hence too Proſpects, enriched with the choiceſt Beauties of her magic Creation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>prime</hi> Origin of the ſuperſtitious Notions and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the People is abſolutely unattainable; we deſpair of ever being able to reach the Fountain Head of Streams which have been running and increaſing from the Beginning of Time. All that we aſpire to do, is only to trace back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as far as poſſible, the Courſes of them on thoſe Charts, that remain, of the diſtant Countries from whence they were firſt perceived to flow.</p>
               <p>Few, who are deſirous of inveſtigating the popular No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and vulgar Ceremonies in our Nation, can fail of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them in their firſt Direction from the Times when Popery was our eſtabliſhed Religion.</p>
               <p>We ſhall not wonder that theſe were able to ſurvive the Reformation, when we conſider, that though our ſenſible and ſpirited Forefathers were, upon Conviction, eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to forego religious Tenets, which had been weighed in the Balance, and ſound wanting; yet were <hi>the People</hi> by no means inclined to annihilate the ſeemingly innocent Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their former ſuperſtitious Faith.</p>
               <p>Theſe, conſecrated to the Fancies of Men, by a Uſage from Time immemorial, though crazed by public Authority from the <hi>written Word,</hi> were committed as a venerable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit to the keeping of <hi>oral Tradition:</hi> like the <hi>Penates</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Troy,</hi> recently deſtroyed, they were religiouſly brought off, after having been ſnatched out of the ſmoking Ruins of Popery.</p>
               <p>It is not improbable that, in the Infancy of Proteſtantiſm, the continuance of many of theſe was connived at by the State. For Men, <q>who are but Children of a larger
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0324300200:4"/>
Growth,</q> are not weaned all at once, and the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Manners, and of Religion, is always moſt ſurely eſtabliſhed, when effected by ſlow Degrees, and as it were imperceptible Gradations.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo at the firſt Promulgation of Chriſtianity to the Gentile Nations, through the Force of Conviction they yielded indeed to Truth; yet they could not be perſuaded to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh many of their Superſtitions, which, rather than forego them altogether, they choſe to blend and incorporate with their new Faith.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian, or rather Papal Rome, borrowed her Rites, Notions, and Ceremonies, in the moſt luxurious Abundance from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Heathen Rome; and much the greater Number of theſe flaunting Externals, which <hi>Infallibility</hi> has adopted, and uſed as Feathers to adorn <hi>her Triple-Cap,</hi> have been ſtolen out of the Wings of the <hi>dying Eagle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With regard to the Rites, Sports, &amp;c. of the Common People, I am aware that the moroſe and bigoted Part of Mankind<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>The Common People, confined by daily Labour, ſeem to require their proper Intervals of Relaxation; perhaps it is of

the higheſt political Utility to encourage innocent Sports and Games among them. The Revival of many of theſe, would, I think, be highly pertinent at this particular Seaſon, when the general Spread of Luxury and Diſſipation threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens more than at any preceding Period to extinguiſh the Character of our boaſted national Bravery. For the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an honeſt old Writer, Stow, (who tells us, ſpeaking of the May-games, Midſummer-Eve<note n="*" place="bottom">I call to mind here the pleaſing Account Mr. Sterne has left us in his Sentimental Journey, of the <hi>Grace-dance</hi> after Supper—I agree with that amiable Writer in thinking that <hi>Religion</hi> may mix herſelf in the Dance, and that innocent Cheerfulneſs is no inconſiderable Part of Devotion; ſuch indeed as cannot fail of being grateful to the <hi>Good Being,</hi>—it is a <hi>ſilent</hi> but <hi>eloquent</hi> Mode of praiſing him!</note> Rejoicings, &amp;c. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently uſed in the Streets of London, <q>which <hi>open</hi> Paſtimes in my Youth being now ſuppreſt, worſe Practices <hi>within Doors</hi> are to be ſeared),</q> may be with ſingular propriety adopted on the moſt tranſient Survey of our preſent popular Manners.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bourne, my Predeceſſor in this Walk, has not, from whatever Cauſe, done Juſtice to the Subject he undertook to treat of. Far from having the Vanity to think that I have exhauſted it, the utmoſt of my Pretenſions is to the Merit of having endeavoured, by making Additions, to improve it. I think him, however, deſerving of no ſmall Share of Praiſe for his imperfect Attempt, for "much is due to thoſe, who firſt broke the Way to Knowledge, and left only to their Succeſſors the Taſk of ſmoothing it."</p>
               <p>New Lights have ariſen ſince his Time. The Engliſh Antique has become a general and faſhionable Study; and the Diſcoveries of the very reſpectable Society of Antiquaries have rendered the Receſſes of Papal and Heathen Antiquities eaſier of acceſs.</p>
               <p>I flatter myſelf I have turned all theſe Circumſtances in ſome meaſure to Advantage. I have gleaned Paſſages that ſeemed to throw Light upon the Subject, from a great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Volumes, and thoſe written too in ſeveral Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; in the doing of which, if I ſhall not be found to having deſerved the Praiſe of Judgment, I muſt at leaſt make Pretenſions to the Merit of Induſtry,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0324300200:6"/>Elegance of Compoſition will hardly be expected in a Work of this Kind, which ſtands much leſs in need of Attic Wit, than of Roman Perſeverance, and <hi>Dutch</hi> Aſſiduity.</p>
               <p>I ſhall offer ſome Diſcoveries, which are peculiarly my own; for there are Cuſtoms yet retained here in the North, of which I am perſuaded the learned of the Southern Part of the Iſland have not heard, which is, perhaps, the ſole Cauſe why they have never before been inveſtigated.</p>
               <p>In peruſing the ſubſequent Obſervations, the candid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who has never before conſidered this neglected Subject, is requeſted not to be raſh in paſſing Sentence, but to ſuſpend his Judgment, at leaſt, till he has carefully examined all the Evidence; by which Caution I do not wiſh to have it underſtood, that our Determinations are thought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, or that every Deciſion here is not amenable to an higher Authority. In the mean time Prejudice may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned, and it will apologize for many ſeemingly trivial Reaſons, aſſigned for the beginning and tranſmitting of this or that <hi>Notion</hi> or <hi>Ceremony,</hi> to reflect, that what may appear fooliſh to the enlightened Underſtandings of Men in the <hi>Eighteenth</hi> Century, wore a very different Aſpect when viewed through the Gloom that prevailed in the <hi>ſeventh</hi> or <hi>eighth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould treſpaſs upon the Patience of my Reader, were I to enumerate all the Books I have conſulted on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; to which, however, I ſhall take Care in their proper Places to refer: but I own myſelf under particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Obligations to <hi>Durand</hi>'s Ritual of Divine Offices; a Work inimical to every Idea of rational Worſhip, but to the Enquirer into the Origin of our popular Ceremonies, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable Magazine of the moſt intereſting Intelligence. I would ſtile this Performance the great <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> of the Romaniſts, in Compariſon with which the <hi>Moſaic Code</hi> is <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> of Rites and Ceremonies. We ſtand amazed on peruſing it at the enormous Weight of a new Yoke which <hi>Holy Church</hi> fabricating <hi>with her own Hands</hi> has impoſed on her ſervile Devotees.</p>
               <p>Yet the Forgers of theſe Shackles had artfully contrived to make them ſit eaſy, by twiſting Flowers around them. Dark as this Picture, drawn by the Pencil of gloomy Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,

               <p>The Calendar was crowded with Red-Letter Days, nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally indeed conſecrated to <hi>Saints;</hi> but which, by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Idleneſs ond Diſſipation of Manners, gave every kind of countenance to SINNERS.</p>
               <p>A Profuſion of childiſh Rites, Pageants and Ceremonies, diverted the Attention of the People from the conſideration of their real State, and kept them in humour, if it did not ſometimes make them in love with their ſlaviſh Modes of Worſhip,</p>
               <p>To the Credit of our ſenſible and manly Forefathers, they were among the firſt who felt the Weight of this new and unneceſſary Yoke, and had Spirit enough to throw it off.</p>
               <p>I have fortunately in my Poſſeſſion one of thoſe antient Romiſh Calendars of ſingular Curioſity, which contains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the immoveable Feaſts and Faſts, (I regret much its Silence on the moveable ones) a variety of brief Obſervations, contributing not a little to the elucidation of many of our popular Cuſtoms, and proving them to have been ſent over from Rome, with <hi>Bulls, Indulgencies,</hi> and other Baubles, bartered, as it ſhould ſeem, for our <hi>Peter-pence,</hi> by thoſe who trafficked in ſpiritual Merchandize from the Continent.</p>
               <p>Theſe I ſhall carefully tranſlate (though in ſome Places it is extremely difficult to render the very barbarous <hi>Latin,</hi> of which I fear the Critic will think I have transfuſed the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, Brevity, and Obſcurity into my own <hi>Engliſh</hi>) and lay before my Reader, who will at once ſee and acknowledge their Utility.</p>
               <p>A learned Performance, by a Doctor Moreſin in the Time of James I. and dedicated to that Monarch, is alſo luckily in my Poſſeſſion. It is written in Latin, and entitled "The Origin and Increaſe of Depravity in Religion;" containing a very maſterly Parallel between the Rites, Notions, &amp;c. of <hi>Heathen</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Papal</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>The copious Extracts from this Work, with which I ſhall adorn the ſubſequent Pages will be their own Eulogy, and ſuperſede my poor Encomiums.</p>

                  <hi>Humanity,</hi> who has tranſmitted his Name to Immortality, by Reflections writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten among the little Tomb-ſtones of the Vulgar, in a Country Church-Yard; I am urged by no falſe Shame to apologize for the ſeeming Unimportance of my Subject.</p>
               <p>The Antiquities of the Common People cannot be ſtudied without acquiring ſome uſeful Knowledge of Mankind. By the chemical Proceſs of Philoſophy, even Wiſdom may be extracted from the Follies and Superſtitions of our Forefathers</p>
               <p>The <hi>People,</hi> of whom Society is chiefly compoſed, and for whoſe good, Superiority of Rank is only a Grant made ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally by mutual Conceſſion, is a reſpectable Subject to every one who is the Friend of Man.</p>
               <p>Pride, which, independent of the Idea ariſing from the Neceſſity of civil Polity, has portioned out the human <hi>Genus</hi> into ſuch a variety of different and ſubordinate <hi>Species,</hi> muſt be compelled to own, that the loweſt of theſe derives itſelf from an Origin, common to it with the higheſt of the Kind. The beautiful Sentiment of <hi>Terence:</hi>
                  <q>"<hi>Homo</hi> ſum, <hi>humani</hi> nihil á me alienum puto."</q>
may be adopted therefore in this Place, to perſuade us that nothing can be foreign to our Enquiry, which concerns the ſmalleſt of the Vulgar; of thoſe <hi>little ones,</hi> who occupy the loweſt Place in the political Arrangement of human Beings.</p>

               <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following Sheets are a few of that vaſt Number of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> which are held by the Common People; ſuch, as they ſolely or generally obſerve. For tho' ſome of them have been of National and others perhaps of univerſal Obſervance, yet at preſent they would have little or no Being, if not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved among the Vulgar.</p>
               <p>I would not be thought a Reviver of old Rites and Ceremonies to the Burdening of the People, nor an Aboliſher of innocent Cuſtoms, which are their Pleaſures and Recreations: I aim at nothing, but a Regulation of thoſe which are in Being amongſt them, which they themſelves are far from thinking burdenſome, and aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſuch only as are ſinful and wicked.</p>
               <p>Some of the Cuſtoms they hold, have been originally good, tho' at preſent they retain little of their primitive Purity; the true Meaning and Deſign of them, being either loſt, or very much in the Dark through Folly and Superſtition. To wipe off therefore the Duſt they have contracted, to clear them of Superſtition, and make known their End and Deſign, may turn to ſome Account, and be of Advantage; whereas obſerving them in the
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0324300200:14"/>
preſent Way, is not only of no Advantage, but of very great Detriment.</p>
               <p>Others they hold, are really ſinful, notwithſtanding in outward Appearance they ſeem very harmleſs, being a Scandal to Religion, and an encouraging of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And therefore to aim at aboliſhing theſe, will I hope be no Crime, tho' they be the Diverſions of the People.</p>
               <p>As to the Opinions they hold, they are almoſt all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, being generally either the Produce of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm; or the Inventions of indolent <hi>Monks,</hi> who having nothing elſe to do, were the Forgers of many ſilly and wicked Opinions, to keep the World in Awe and Ignorance. And indeed the ignorant Part of the World, is ſo ſtill aw'd, that they follow the idle Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the one, more than the Word of GOD; and have more Dependance upon the lucky Omens of the other than his Providence, more Dread of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky ones, than his Wrath and Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The regulating therefore of theſe Opinions and Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, is what I propos'd by the following Compoſitions, whatever has been ſuggeſted to the contrary: And as to the Menaces of ſome, and the Cenſures of others, I neither fear nor regard them. I ſhall be always ready to own any Miſtake, and in what I juſtly may, to vindicate myſelf.</p>

               <p>THE Ceremony of tolling the Bell at the Time of Death, ſeems to be as ancient as the having of Bells them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; we are told,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bingham</hi>'s Orig. Eccl. Lib. 3.</note> it was about the ſeventh Century when Bells were firſt in the Church, and that venerable <hi>Bede</hi> is the firſt that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions them. If this be true, then it is as true, that the tolling of the Bell was inſtituted about that Time; for where our Countryman
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0324300200:20"/>
mentions the Word <hi>Campana,</hi> or Bell, there it alſo is, that we find a Bell made uſe of for the Dead:<note n="*" place="bottom">Haec, tunc in dormitorio ſororum pauſans, exaudivit ſubito in aere notum campanae ſonum, quo ad orationes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citari vel convocari ſolebant, cum quis eorum de ſeculo fuiſſet evocatus. <hi>Bed. Eccl. Hiſt Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 23.</note> For at the Death of the Abbeſs St. <hi>Hilda,</hi> he tells us that one of the Siſters of a diſtant Monaſtery, as ſhe was ſleeping, thought ſhe heard the well-known Sound of that Bell, which called them to Prayers, when any of them had departed this Life. But be that as it will, it is evident that the Bell was tolled upon this Occaſion about <hi>Bede</hi>'s Time, and conſequently that the Ceremony is as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as his Days.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon why this cuſtom was inſtituted, was not, as ſome ſeem to imagine, for no other End than to acquaint the Neighbourhood, that ſuch a Perſon was dead; but chiefly, that whoever heard the Noiſe of the Bell, ſhould put up their Prayers for the Soul: Thus the Father above-mentioned tells us again,<note n="†" place="bottom">Quod cum illa audiſſet, ſuſcitavit cunctas ſorores &amp; in eccleſiam convocatas, orationibus &amp; pſalmis pro anima matris operam dare monuit. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> That ſhe who preſided in this Monaſtery, had no ſooner heard this, than ſhe raiſed all the Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and called them into the Church, where ſhe exhorted them to pray fervently, and ſing a <hi>Requiem</hi> for the Soul of their Mother. <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalion</hi>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Et talis ritus etiam de praeſenti ſervatur in <hi>Anglia,</hi> ut cum quis deceſſit, ſtatim campana propriae illius Parochiae ſpeciali quodam modo ſonat per aliquod temporis ſpatium.— Quamvis <hi>Angli</hi> negent modo orationes &amp; ſuffragia defunctis proficua; non aliam tamen in hoc ab illis rationem potui per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere, quam quod talis ſonus ſit ritus antiquae eccleſiae <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glicanae, Caſſali</hi> de vet Sac, Chriſt.

                  <hi>the ſame Cuſtom is ſtill obſerved in</hi> England, <hi>that as ſoon as any hath departed this Life, the Bell belonging to the Pariſh he liv'd in, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately tolled, and for ſome Time.—And though</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the</hi> Engliſh <hi>now deny, that Prayers are of any Service to the Dead; yet I could meet with no other Account of this Ceremony, than that it was a Cuſtom of the old Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>And for this Reaſon it is, that this Cuſtom was firſt obſerved, and ſhould be ſtill retained among us, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Prayers of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful may be aſſiſting to the Soul; and certainly it might be more profitably retained, were it ſo ordered, that the Bell ſhould be tolled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Perſon's Departure, as was undoubtedly deſigned when this Ceremony was continued, that good men might give him their Prayers. Was this always ſo obſerved, there might be ſome <hi>Moſes</hi> amongſt the Number of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whoſe Prayers could prevail upon God to beat back <hi>the Amalekites of Darkneſs;</hi> ſome whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> might remove a <hi>Mountain of Sins,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0324300200:22"/>
and ſome whoſe Tears procure a Multitude of Mercies. O the Comfort of <hi>the Forgiveneſs of Sins!</hi> Of <hi>being guided ſafely through the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death!</hi> Of arriving ſecurely at the heavenly Country! What is it that Prayer can't obtain?</p>
               <p>But though the Wickedneſs and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the dying Perſon be ſuch, as that the Prayers of the Faithful will not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to avert the Wrath and Puniſhment of a juſtly incenſed God; yet as this can be only known to God, it will not diſcharge Men from recommending him to the Divine Mercy, in the moſt paſſionate and affectionate Manner. They thereby expreſs the moſt laudable Zeal, the moſt diſintereſted Charity; and whilſt they are ſo ſolicitous for the Happineſs and Welfare of other Men's Souls, they cannot but be thereby influenced to have the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for their own, and be both encouraged and directed to proceed with an holy Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>from Strength to Strength,</hi> and endeavour as the<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. vi. 1.</note> Apoſtle adviſes, <hi>to go on to Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, alas! we are fallen into Times of ſuch Irreligion and Prejudice, ſuch Contempt of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and ſuch too great Reformation, that what with Indolence on one Hand, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance on the other; what with no Zeal on this

Side, and too<note n="*" place="bottom">Among the many Objections of the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> it is laid to the Charge of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that though we deny the Doctrine of Purgatory, and teach the contrary, yet how well our Practice ſuits with it, may be conſidered in our ringing of hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Bells for the Soul.

                  </note> falſe a one on that; we either neglect the moſt decent Ceremonies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or we think it is Religion to have no Ceremonies at all.

                     <hi>In a Veſtry-Book belonging to the Chapel of</hi> All-Saints, <hi>in</hi> Newcaſtle upon Tyne, <hi>it is obſervable, That the Tolling of the Bell is not mentioned in the Pariſh Accounts, from the Year</hi> 1643, <hi>till</hi> 1655, <hi>when we find it ordered to be tolled again.

But when we retain the Cuſtom, only to procure the Prayers of the Faithful for a departing Soul, it would ſurely be of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to obſerve it, if the <hi>Prayers of a righteous Man avail</hi> any Thing at all; which, if we may believe an inſpired Apoſtle, are of very great Efficacy and Validity.</p>
               <p>Art thou then attending a Friend in his laſt Moments? Art thou careful for his Soul, and ſolicitous for his Salvation? Doſt thou wiſh him ſafe <hi>through the Valley of Death to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Hills?</hi> Wouldſt thou have the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels protect him, and be his <hi>Shield againſt the Powers of Darkneſs?</hi> In ſhort, wouldſt thou have him crown'd with the Joys of <hi>Paradiſe?</hi> Be aſſured then, that the Prayers of good men
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0324300200:25"/>
will very much contribute to the gaining of theſe Things. But how ſhall they then pray for him, if they know not of his Departure? And how can they know that, without the tolling of the Bell? Do thou therefore put in Practice this decent and profitable Cuſtom, not as our Age generally does, after the Death of thy Friend, but before it; before he leave the World, when the Prayers of good Men can aſſiſt him, and facilitate his Journey into the other Life.</p>
               <p>Or, art thou <hi>working in the Field, or grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Mill?</hi> Remember then, when thou heareſt the Sound of the Bell for one depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that thou put up thy Prayers for him.

               <p>But now it may be objected, That as the Bell is ſeldom tolled till after the Perſon's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, it is to no Purpoſe to pray for the Soul; nay to pray for it, would be praying for the Dead: And ſince that is repugnant to the Doctrine of our Church, our Prayers at that Time had much better be omitted.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is too true, this Cuſtom is not ſo common as it ſhould be; but however, it is ſo much obſerved, as will be able to vindicate the putting up of conſtant Prayers. I know ſeveral religious Families in this Place, and I hope it is ſo in other Places too, who always obſerve it, whenever the melancholy Seaſon offers; and therefore it will at leaſt ſometimes happen, when we put up our Prayers conſtantly at the tolling of the Bell, that we ſhall pray for a Soul departing. And tho' it be granted, that it will oftener happen otherwiſe, as the regular Cuſtom is ſo little followed; yet that can be no harmful praying for the Dead. We
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0324300200:27"/>
believe that the Soul is but departing, and it is charitably done to offer up our Prayers: And therefore when it proves otherwiſe, <hi>our</hi>

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER I.</head>
                  <p>OUR Author ſeems of Opinion, that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of tolling a Bell<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſubſequent Etymology of this Word has the Sanction of the learned Sir Henry Spelman: <hi>Bell</hi> is derived from <hi>Pelvis,</hi> a Baſon: for before the Invention of Bells, not only <hi>ſounding Braſs,</hi> but <hi>Baſons</hi> alſo were uſed inſtead of them. (Houſewives to this Day try the Soundneſs of their Earthen or China Vaſes by <hi>ringing</hi> them with a Finger). Vide Lye's Junii Etymolog. in verbo.— Mr Wheatley, in his Illuſtration of the Liturgy, apologizes for our retaining this Ceremony. <q>Our Church (ſays he) in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints in former Ages, calls in the Miniſter and others, who are at hand, to aſſiſt their Brother in his laſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. In order to this ſhe directs that when any one is <hi>paſſing</hi> out of this Life, a Bell ſhould be tolled, &amp;c.</q> It is called from thence the <hi>Paſſing Bell.</hi>
                     </note> at the Time of Death, is as antient as the Uſe of Bells. This is ſomewhat improbable. It has rather been an After-Invention of Superſtition. Thus praying for the <hi>Dying</hi> was <hi>improved upon</hi> into praying for the <hi>Dead.</hi> Bells muſt have been firſt uſed as Signals to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene the People to their public Devotions.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bourne has overlooked a Paſſage in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand's Ritual that would have been much to his Purpoſe<note n="†" place="bottom">

                        <p>In Ray's Collection of old Engliſh Proverbs I find the following Couplet:
<q>
                              <l>When thou doſt hear a Toll, or Knell,</l>
                              <l>Then think upon <hi>thy</hi> paſſing Bell.</l>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0324300200:31"/>
Ritualiſt, Bells muſt be tolled, that the People may put up their Prayers.—Let this be done <hi>twice</hi> for a <hi>Woman</hi> and <hi>thrice</hi> for a <hi>Man:</hi>
                     </q> (The ſuperſtitious Reaſons he aſſigns for theſe Numbers are too contemptible for Tranſlation) <q>If for a Clergyman, <hi>as many Times</hi> as he had <hi>Orders,</hi> and at the Concluſion a Peal on <hi>all</hi> the Bells, to diſtinguiſh the Quality of the Perſon for whom the People are to put up their Prayers. A Bell too muſt be rung while we are conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Corpſe to Church, and during the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out of the Church to the Grave.</q> I think this a curious and pertinent Quotation. It ſeems to account for a Cuſtom ſtill preſerved in the North, of making numeral Diſtinctions at the Concluſion of this Ceremony—<hi>nine</hi> Knells for a Man, <hi>ſix</hi> for a Woman, and <hi>three</hi> for a Child, which are without Doubt the Veſtiges of this antient Injunction of Popery.</p>
                  <p>The Quotation our Author gives us from Bede<note n="*" place="bottom">I have examined this Paſſage in King Alfred's Saxon Verſion of Bede: In rendering <hi>Campana,</hi> I find he has uſed Cluggan, which properly ſignifies a <hi>Clock (Bellan</hi> is in the Margin). <hi>Clock</hi> is the old German Name for a Bell, and hence the French call one <hi>une Clóche.</hi> There were no Clocks in England in Alfred's Time. He is ſaid to have meaſured his Time by Wax Candles, marked with circular Lines to diſtinguiſh the Hours.—I would infer from this, that our Clocks have certainly been ſo called from the <hi>Bells</hi> in them.—Mr. Strutt confeſſes he has not been able to trace the Date of the Invention of Clocks in England.—Stow tells us they were commanded to be ſet up in Churches in the Year 612. A groſs Miſtake! and into which our honeſt Hiſtorian muſt have been led by his miſunderſtanding the Word <hi>Cloca,</hi> a Latin Term coined from the old German Name for a <hi>Bell.</hi> For <hi>Clocks</hi> therefore read <hi>Bells.</hi>
                     </note> is very appoſite, as is that from Caſſalion's occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0324300200:32"/>
Comment. The latter however appears to no great Advantage as an Antiquary, when he tells us <q>he could meet with no other Account of this Ceremony, than that it was a Cuſtom of the old Church of England.</q> The Paſſage above cited from Durand would have informed him from whence it muſt have been imported into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>It may gratify the Curioſity of ſome to peruſe the following general Obſervations on Bells<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Spelman in his very learned Gloſſary, verb. <hi>Campana,</hi> has preſerved two Monkiſh Lines, in which all the antient Offices of Bells ſeem to be included.</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>Laudo Deum verum, Plebem voco, congrego Clerum,</l>

                        </q>
                        <p>We praiſe the true God, call the People, convene the Clergy, Lament the Dead, diſpel Peſtilence, and grace Feſtivals.</p>
                     </note>.—I have not been able to aſcertain preciſely the Date of this uſeful Invention. The Antients had ſome Sort of Bells. I find the Word <hi>Tintinnabula,</hi> (which we uſually render <hi>Bells</hi>) in Martial, Juvenal, and Suetonius. The Romans were ſummoned by theſe (of whatever Size or Form they were) to their hot Baths, and to the Buſineſs of public Places.</p>
                  <p>The large Kind of Bells now in Uſe are ſaid to have been invented by Paulinus, Biſhop of Nola, in Campania, (whence the Latin Name <hi>Campana</hi>)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0324300200:33"/>
about the Year 400<note n="*" place="bottom">Spelman's Gloſs. verb Campana. Truſter's Chronology.</note>, and to have been generally uſed in Churches about the 600th Year of the Chriſtian Aera. Mr. Bingham<note n="†" place="bottom">Antiquities of Chriſt. Church, Vol. I. p. 316.</note> however thinks this a vulgar Error. In ſhort, we are left much in the Dark concerning the Antiquities of the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier Ages of the Church.—Eccleſiaſtical Writers frequently claſh in their Accounts.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Joſephus.</note> The Jews uſed Trumpets for Bells: The Turks permit not the Uſe of Bells: The Greek Church under them ſtill follow their old Cuſtom of uſing wooden Boards, or Iron Plates full of holes, which they hold in their Hands, and knock with a Hammer or Mallet, to call the People together to Church<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                        <p>See Dr. Smith's Account of the Greek Church. He was an Eye-Witneſs of this remarkable Cuſtom, which Durand tells us is retained in the Romiſh Church on the three laſt Days of the Week preceding Eaſter. Durandi Rational. p. 331. 3.</p>
                        <p>Bingham informs us of an Invention before Bells for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening religious Aſſemblies in Monaſteries: It was going by Turns to every one's Cell, and with the Knock of a Hammer calling the Monks to Church. The Inſtrument was called the Night-Signal and the wakening Mallet.—In many of the Colleges at Oxford the Bible Clerk knocks at every Room Door with a Key, to waken the Students in the Morning, before he begins to ring the Chapel Bell.—A Veſtige it ſhould ſeem of the antient monaſtic Cuſtom.</p>
                     </note>: China has been remarkably famous for its Bells— Father le Compte tells us, that at Pekin there are ſeven Bells, each of which weighs one hundred and twenty thouſand Pounds.</p>

                  <p>Diſtinction of Rank is preſerved here in the tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Soul-Bell; an high Fee excludes the common People, and appropriates to the Death of Perſons of Conſequence the tolling the great Bell of each Church on this Occaſion.—With us too (as Durand orders above) a Bell is tolled, and ſometimes Chimes are rung, a little before the Burial, and while they are conducting the Corps to Church: They chime or ring too in ſome places while the grave is filling up.</p>
                  <p>There ſeems to be nothing intended by tolling the <hi>paſſing</hi> Bell at preſent, but to inform the Neighbourhood of any Perſon's Death, and I am much miſtaken if our Author's<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Bourne complains in his Preface of the <hi>invidious</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of ſome of his Townſmen:—It is beneath a Man, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of inward Worth,</hi> to <hi>complain</hi> of that which he ought always <hi>to deſpiſe.</hi>—Poſterity ſeems to have done him very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Juſtice for their Inſults:—A Copy of the <hi>Antiquitates Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gares</hi> has of late fetched ſeven or eight Shillings in London. —Many perhaps will think the Purchaſers miſtook an Accident for Merit, and confounded the Idea of <hi>Scarceneſs</hi> with that of <hi>intrinſic Value.</hi>—I received this Information from one of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Antiquaries, who underſtands the Subject too well himſelf to be miſtaken in his Opinion of the Merit of thoſe who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon it.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Watching with the Dead.</head>
               <p>WATCHING with the Corps was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Cuſtom of the Church, and every where practiſed. They were wont to ſit by it, from the Time of its Death till its Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Grave, either in the Houſe it died in, or in the Church itſelf. Agreeable to this, we read in St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That as they watched his Mother <hi>Monica,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalterium arripuit <hi>Fuodius,</hi> &amp; cantare caepit pſalmum, cui reſpondebamus omnes domus: Miſerecordiam &amp; judicium cantabo tibi Domine. <hi>Aug. Lib</hi> 9. <hi>Confeſ. C.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Euodius</hi> took the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> and began to ſing a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which the whole Family anſwered with that of the Pſalmiſt <hi>David, I will ſing of Mercy and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unto thee, O LORD, will I ſing.</hi> And we are told,<note n="†" place="bottom">Ad eccleſiam antelucana hora qua defunctus eſt, corpus ipſius portatum eſt: ibique eadem fuit nocte, quam vigilavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in paſcha. <hi>Greg. Turon. de Gloria, Confeſ. C.</hi> 104.</note> That at the Death of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> his Body was carried into the Church before Day, the ſame Hour he died. It was the Night before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and they watched with him there.</p>
               <p>How unlike to this antient Cuſtom of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the modern one, of locking up the Corps
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0324300200:39"/>
in a Room, and leaving it there alone? How unlike to this decent Manner of watching, is that watching of the Vulgar, which is a Scene of Sport and Drinking and Lewdneſs? Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that Time with a dear Friend, is the laſt Kindneſs and Reſpect we can ſhew him; and how unfriendly is it, to change it into Negligence and too great Reſignation? How unchriſtian, inſtead of a becoming Sorrow and decent Gravity, to put on an unbecoming Joy and undecent Paſtime.</p>

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>OUR Author, for what Reaſon I know not, has omitted the vulgar Name given here to this <hi>watching with a Corps.</hi> It is called the <hi>Lake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake;</hi> a Word plainly derived from the Anglo-Saxon Lic or Lice, <hi>a Corpſe,</hi> and Waecce, <hi>a Wake, Vigil,</hi> or <hi>Watching.</hi> It is uſed in this Senſe by Chaucer, in his Knight's Tale:
<q>
                        <l>—Shall not be told for me,</l>
                        <l>How that Arcite is brent to Aſhen cold,</l>
                        <l>Ne how that there the <hi>Liche-wake</hi> was yhold</l>
                        <l>All that Night long.</l>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0324300200:40"/>
Thus alſo I read in the Article <hi>Walkin,</hi> in the learned<note n="*" place="bottom">By the late Mr. Ruddiman, as is generally ſuppoſed.</note> Gloſſary to Douglas' Virgil, <q>Properly <hi>Like-wakes</hi> (Scotch) are the Meetings of the Friends of the Deceaſed, a Night, or Nights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Burial.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not ſatisfied with either of the Quotations he has given us in Proof of the Antiquity of the Cuſtom: They are indeed ſomething to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but in the laſt cited Paſſage, one would be inclined to think from the Words of the Original, that the <hi>Watching</hi> was on Account of its being the Vigil of Eaſter-Day.</p>
                  <p>The ſubſequent Extract from one of the antient Councils quoted in Durant,<note n="†" place="bottom">Porro obſervandum eſt, nedum Pſalmos cani conſuetum, cum funus ducitur, ſed etiam <hi>nocte, quoe praecedit funus, veteres vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe.</hi> nocturnaſque vigilias canendis Pſalmis egiſſe.</note> p. 232, is, I think, much more appoſite:—<q>Now it muſt be obſerved, that Pſalms are wont to be ſung not only when the Corps is conducted to Church, but that the Antients <hi>watched on the Night</hi> before the Burial, and ſpent the Vigil in ſinging Pſalms.</q> So alſo <hi>Gregory,</hi> in the Epiſtle that treats of the Death of his Siſter Macrina, has theſe Words:<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cùm igitur (inquit) <hi>nocturna pervigilatio,</hi> ut in Martyrum ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebritate canendis Pſalmis perfecta eſſet &amp; Crepuſculum adve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſet, &amp;c. Durant, p. 232.</note> "Now when the <hi>nightly Watching,</hi> as is uſual" &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I could give numerous Paſſages from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, were there any Doubt of the Antiquity of a Cuſtom, which probably owes its Origin to the tendereſt <hi>Affections</hi> of human Nature, and has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps on that Account been uſed from the Infancy of Time.</p>

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0324300200:41"/>I find in Durant a pretty exact Account of ſome of the Ceremonies uſed at preſent in what we call <hi>laying out</hi> or <hi>ſtreeking</hi>

                  <hi>let me know my End, and the Number of my Days, that I may be certified how long I have to live. Behold thou haſt made my Days, as it were a Span long, and mine Age is nothing in reſpect of Thee; and verily every Man living is altogether Vanity. And now, LORD, what is my Hope?

               <p>And as this Form of Proceſſion is an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of our dying ſhortly after our Friend, ſo the carrying of Ivy, or Laurel, or Roſemary, or ſome of thoſe Ever-Greens, is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality. It is as much as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0324300200:48"/>

               <p>And as the carrying of theſe Ever-Greens is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality, ſo it is alſo of the Reſurrection of the Body: For as theſe Herbs are not entirely pluck'd up, but only cut down, and will, at the returning Seaſon, revive and ſpring up again; ſo the Body, like them, is but cut down for a while,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0324300200:49"/>
and will riſe and ſhoot up again at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. For, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. lxiii. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Our Bones ſhall flouriſh like an Herb.</hi>

               <p>It was cuſtomary<note n="†" place="bottom">Greg. C. 26.</note> among the antient <hi>Jews,</hi> as they returned from the Grave, to pluck up the Graſs two or three Times, and then throw it behind them, ſaying theſe Words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>They ſhall flouriſh out of the City like Graſs upon the Earth:</hi> Which they did, to ſhew, that the Body, though dead, ſhould ſpring up again as the Graſs. Thus by theſe two antient Ceremonies, we have placed before our Eyes, our Mortality and Immortality; the one ſpeaks the Death of the Body, the other the Life of the Soul, nay, and the Life of the Body too; for like that Herb we carry, it is not quite pluck'd up, but ſhall one Day be alive again. When it hath laid in the Earth the <hi>Winter</hi> Seaſon, the Continuance of this World, and the Warmth and Influence of the <hi>Spring</hi> is come, the joyful Spring of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, it ſhall be enliven'd, and ſhoot up, and eternally flouriſh.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cor. i. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>For this Corruptible muſt put on Incorruption, and this Mortal muſt put on Immortality. O Death, where is thy Sting! O Grave, where is thy Victory! Thanks be to GOD, who giveth us the Victory through our LORD JESUS CHRIST.</hi>

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0324300200:50"/>There is another Cuſtom uſed in ſome Places, at the Proceſſion of Funerals, which pays a due Honour to the Dead, and gives Comfort and Conſolation to the Living; and that is, the carrying out the Dead with Pſalmody. This was an antient Cuſtom of the Church; for in ſome of the earlieſt Ages, they carried out their Dead to the Grave with ſinging of Pſalms and Hymns. Thus <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us, That when the Body of <hi>Babylas</hi> the Martyr was removed by the Order of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, the Chriſtians<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoi kata, <hi>&amp;c.

In Imitation of this, it is ſtill cuſtomary in ſeveral Parts of this Nation, to carry out the Dead with ſinging of Pſalms and Hymns of Triumph; to ſhew that they have ended their ſpiritual Warfare, that they have finiſhed their Courſe with Joy, and are become Conquerors; which ſurely is a Matter of no little Conſolation for the looſing of our Friend. And how becoming is it to pay ſuch
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0324300200:51"/>
Honour to the Body! How is it imitating the bleſſed Angels, who rejoyced at Meeting of the Soul, and carrying it to Heaven. For as they rejoyce <hi>at her Converſion on Earth,</hi> ſo moſt certainly they rejoyce at her going to Heaven. And as they rejoyce at the carrying of the Soul thither, ſo we, in Imitation of them, at the carrying out the Body to the Grave. They rejoyce that the Soul hath got out of a World of Sin, we that the Body out of a World of Trouble; they that the Soul can ſin no more, we that the Body can no more ſuffer; they that the Soul enjoys Glory and Happineſs, we that the Body reſts from its Labours.</p>
               <p>When therefore we attend the Corps of a Neighbour or Relation, and this decent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is perform'd, let it alſo have a Share of our Thoughts, and excite in us Joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and Thankſgiving and Praiſe.

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Garlands in Country Churches: Of ſtrawing Flowers on the Grave; the Antiquity of theſe Cuſtoms, the Innocency of them.</head>
               <p>IN ſome Country Churches 'tis cuſtomary, to hang <hi>a Garland of Flowers</hi> over the Seats of <hi>deceaſed Virgins,</hi> as a Token of Eſteem and Love, and an Emblem of their Reward in the heavenly Church.</p>
               <p>This Cuſtom perhaps may be look'd upon, as ſprung from that ancient Cuſtom of the Heathens, of <hi>crowning</hi> their <hi>Corps,</hi> with <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> in Token of Victory. But Mr. <hi>Bingham</hi> tells us, That we find not this Cuſtom uſed by the <hi>Ancients</hi> in their <hi>Funeral Rites.</hi> For as he obſerves, the Heathen in <hi>Minutius</hi> makes it one Topick of Accuſation againſt them,<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>But if they did not crown them after the Manner of the Heathens, they had a Cuſtom of uſing Crowns of Flowers, if we may believe <hi>Caſſalion,</hi> who tells us,<note n="†" place="bottom">Euit quoque mos ad capita virginum apponendi ſlorum coronas, <hi>&amp;c. Caſſ. de Vet. Sacr. Chriſt. P.</hi> 334.</note> It was a Cuſtom of the ancient Chriſtians to place Crowns of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0324300200:58"/>
Flowers, at the Heads of deceaſed Virgins; for which he quotes <hi>Damaſcen, Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And this hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably been the Original of this Cuſtom among the Vulgar.</p>
               <p>That other Cuſtom of <hi>ſtrawing Flowers</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Graves</hi> of their departed Friends, is alſo derived from a Cuſtom of the ancient Church. For it was uſual in thoſe Times for the common Sort of People, to ſtraw the Graves of their Friends with various Flowers. Of this there are two notable Inſtances taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by <hi>Caſſalion,</hi> and ſeveral other Ritualiſts. The one is that of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in his <hi>Funeral Oration</hi> on the Death of <hi>Valentinian,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Nec ego floribus tumulum ejus aſperagam, ſed ſpiritum ejus Chriſti odore perfundam; ſpargant alii plenis lilia cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this: Nobis lilium eſt Chriſtus: Hoc reliquias ejus ſacrabo. <hi>Ambroſ Orat. Funebri. ae obitu Valentin.</hi>

                  <hi>I will not ſprinkle his Grave with Flowers, but pour on his Spirit the Odour of CHRIST.</hi> Let <hi>others ſcatter Baſkets of Flowers: CHRIST is our Lilly, and with this will I conſecrate his Relicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other is that of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Pammachius</hi> upon the Death of his Wife.<note n="†" place="bottom">Caeteri mariti ſuper tumulos conjugum ſpargunt violas, roſas, lilia, floreſque purpureos, &amp; dolorem pectoris his oſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciis conſolantur; <hi>Pammachius</hi> noſter ſanctum favillam oſſaque veneranda eleemoſynae balſamis rigat. <hi>Hieron.

               <p>Now theſe Inſtances, tho' they juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend theſe other Actions, and wiſely prefer them to the Ceremonies of adorning Graves with Flowers, yet they no Way decry theſe ancient Cuſtoms. Theſe lower Marks of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem and Honour, which the <hi>Vulgar</hi> paid to the Remains of their Friends, were in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves harmleſs and innocent, and had no Cenſure; and as they were ſo, ſo ſhould the preſent Cuſtoms be without any, being full as harmleſs and innocent as the other.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of Bowing towards the Altar at the firſt coming into the Church; a Cuſtom generally obſerved by ignorant People; its Meaning and Antiquity.</head>
               <p>WE may obſerve the Generality of old People among the Commonalty, as they enter into the Church, to turn their Faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Altar,</hi> and bow or kneel that Way. This, no Doubt, is the Remains of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtom of the Church, of worſhipping toward the Eaſt: For in the ancient Church they worſhipped that Way upon ſeveral Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That by ſo worſhipping, they might lift up their Minds to GOD, who is called the Light and the Creator of Light. And therefore St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Cum ad orationem ſtamus, ad orientem covertimur, unde caelum ſurgit, &amp;c. Ut admoneatur animus ad naturam excellentiorem ſe convertere, id eſt, ad Dominum. <hi>Aug. de Serm. Domini. in Mont.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0324300200:63"/>
Deſire to return thither. St. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tells us, That<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> becauſe the Scripture ſays, That GOD planted <hi>Paradiſe</hi> in <hi>Eden</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, where he <hi>placed the Man which he had formed,</hi> whom he puniſh'd with Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his Tranſgreſſion, and made him dwell over againſt <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> in the weſtern Part; we therefore pray, (ſays he) being in Queſt of our ancient Country; and as it were <hi>panting</hi> after it, do worſhip GOD that Way. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was uſed when any were baptized. They firſt turn'd their Faces to the Weſt, and ſo renounc'd the Devil; and then to the Eaſt, and made their Covenant with CHRIST. <hi>Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> They prayed that Way, believing that our SAVIOUR would come to Judgment from that Quarter of the Heavens. <hi>For as the Lightning cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth unto the Weſt, ſo ſhall the Coming of the Son of Man be; and he is to come in like Manner as he aſcended.</hi> And that he aſcended up Eaſtward from Mount <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,</hi> St.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Damaſcen</hi> aſſures us. For (ſays he) when he aſcended into Heaven, he was taken up Eaſtward, and his Diſciples worſhipped him that Way. And therefore chiefly it was, that in the ancient Church they prayed with their Faces to the Eaſt; and that many of our own Church at this Day, turn their

                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0324300200:64"/>
Faces to that Quarter of the World, at the Repetition of the Creed.</p>
               <p>What may more confirm this, and ſpeak it to have been the univerſal Opinion of the Church, is the ancient Cuſtom of burying the Corps, with the Feet to the Eaſt, and the Head to the Weſt; which Cuſtom is continued to this Day in the whole Church of <hi>England:</hi> This was obſerved for the ſame Reaſon, That, at the Coming of CHRIST to Judgment from the oriental Part of Heaven, our Bodies might be found in a praying Poſture, with their Faces towards the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>Our learned Countryman <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us, <q>That the holy Men of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hold a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition generally received from their Ancients, that our SAVIOUR himſelf was buried with his Face and Feet towards the Eaſt.</q> It is affirmed by the Geographers of the holy Land. And <hi>Bede</hi> ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Introcuntes ab oriente in domum illam rotundam quae in petra exciſa eſt, viderunt angelum ſedentem ad meridianam partem loci illius, ubi poſitum fuerat corpus Jeſu; hoc enim erat in dextris, quod nimirum, corpus, quod ſupinum jacens caput habebat ad occaſum, dexteram neceſſe eſt habere ad auſtrum. <hi>Bed. in Dic. Sanct. Paſchae, Tom.</hi> 7.</note> That as the Holy Women enter'd at the Eaſtern Part into the Round-houſe, which is hewn out in the Rock, they ſaw the Angel ſitting at the South Part of the Place, where the Body of JESUS had lain,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0324300200:65"/>
that is, at his Right Hand; for undoubtedly his Body having his Face upwards and its Head to the Weſt, muſt have its Right Hand to the South. <hi>Caſſalion</hi> ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Adeo tenaces fuere priſci illi fideles in hoc ritu reſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endi in orientem, ut non ſolum ipſi viventes, hoc in eorum precibus exacte ſervarent, verum etiam mortui eorum corpora ſupina in ſepulchris facie orientem reſpicerent. <hi>Caſſ. de Vet. Rit. Chriſt. P.</hi> 30.</note> The Faithful of old were ſo obſerving of this Ceremony of looking towards the Eaſt, that they not only ſtrictly obſerved it in their Prayers when liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but even when they were dead, their Bodies were placed with their Faces upwards in the Sepulchre, looking towards the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>The learned Dr. <hi>Comber,</hi> in his Diſcourſe of the ſolemn Interment, hath theſe Words upon this ſubject, <q>We may note the Poſiture and Poſition of the Corps, which among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hath always been to turn the Feet to the Eaſt, with the Head to the Weſt; that ſo they may be ready to meet the LORD, whom the Ancients did believe ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the oriental Part of Heaven. <hi>Durand. Rat. Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 33. Or as our ingenious Mr <hi>Gregory</hi> believes, That they might be in the Poſture of Prayer, with their Faces to the Eaſt, as ſoon as they were raiſed. There are ſome ancient Authors tell us, That the old Inhabitants of <hi>Attica</hi> buried thus before
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0324300200:66"/>
the Days of <hi>Solon,</hi> who, as they report, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that the Iſland of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamis</hi> did of Right belong to them, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them dead Bodies looking that Way, and Sepulchres turned towards the Eaſt, as they uſed to bury. <hi>Diog. Laert. Vit. Solon,</hi> &amp;c. And the Scholiaſt upon <hi>Thucidides</hi> ſays, It was the Manner of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> to bury their Dead thus: Though a learned modern Writer ſuppoſes theſe Authors miſtaken, and cites <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Elian</hi> to prove, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> turned their Dead towards the Weſt. However it is certain, that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had one certain Way of placing the Corps, from which they would not vary; and we Chriſtians have ſo great Antiquity for our Cuſtom, that we ought not out of Singularity to alter it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>No Doubt but this learned Man had great Reaſon for this Concluſion, as well knowing that this ancient Rite was ſtruck at by the whole Herd of Sectaries, as a filly Fancy and an idle Dream: Who never would obſerve it, were it not that they are ſometimes obliged; but would with thoſe who are not obliged, act the very Reverſe, and bury North and South. I wiſh there were no powerfuller Enemies to it, than them now a Days; but, <hi>as a Man's Enemies are too often thoſe of his own Houſhold;</hi> ſo, 'tis to be lamented, that ſome who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0324300200:67"/>
to be of our own Church, are upon all Occaſions ſecret Advocates againſt this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. When therefore there is ſuch Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition without, and ſuch Treachery within, 'tis high Time to be on the Guard againſt our Enemies; leaſt a Ceremony ſo venerable for its Antiquity, and ſo uſeful in its Obſervation, be laid aſide: Was it but for this one Thing, that it ſpeaks the Hope of the whole Chriſtian Church, ſince the earlieſt Times of Chriſtianity, about the Reſurrection of the ſame Body. It is too true, that there are ſome at this Time of the Day, as well as were in the Days of the Apoſtle, who think <hi>it a Thing incredible that GOD ſhould raiſe the Dead;</hi> ſome really diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing the Reſurrection of any Body, and others that of the ſame Body. But as long as this Ceremony is in Being, it will always be a ready Proof, that the whole Chriſtian Church did not only believe the Reſurrection of the Body, but of that very Body which was laid down in the Grave. For they obſerved it, that they might be ready with their Faces to meet their SAVIOUR at his coming to Judgment, which certainly implies that they believed that very Body ſhould riſe again.</p>

                  <p>WE may add to Mr. Bourne's Remarks, that the Cuſtom is <hi>ſtill</hi> retained in many Churches, of turning to the Altar while the Congregation are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the Creed.—The Forms are both derived to us from the ſame Origin.

                        <p>The learned Mr. Mede tells us, that what reverential Guiſe, Ceremony, or Worſhip they uſed at their Ingreſs into Churches, in the Ages next to the Apoſtles (and ſome he believes they did) is wholly buried in Silence and Oblivion.

               <p>IT is a received Tradition among the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, That at the Time of Cock-crowing, the Midnight Spirits forſake theſe lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and go to their proper Places. They wander, ſay they, about the World, from the dead Hour of Night, when all Things are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Sleep and Darkneſs, till the Time of Cock-crowing, and then they depart. Hence it is, that in Country-Places, where the Way of Life requires more early Labour, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways go chearfully to Work at that Time; whereas if they are called abroad ſooner, they are apt to imagine every Thing they ſee or hear, to be a wandring Ghoſt. <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> hath given us an excellent Account of this vulgar Notion, in his Tragedy of <hi>Hamlet.</hi>

               <p>Now to ſhew what Truth there is in this vulgar Opinion, I ſhall conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> What Truth there is in the Roaming of Spirits in the Night. And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to go away at Cock-crow.</p>
               <p>I believe none who aſſent to the Truth of Divine Revelation, deny that there are good and evil Angels attending upon Men; the one to guard and protect them, and the other to harm and work their Ruin; that the one are thoſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. i. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>miniſtring Spirits, which are ſent out to miniſter to the Heirs of Salvation;</hi> the other the <hi>roaring Lion,</hi> and his Inſtruments,<note n="†" place="bottom">Job. ii. 2.</note>

                  <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirits who wander through dry Places, ſeeking Reſt and finding none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOR, I believe, will it be queſtion'd, that there have been Apparitions of good and evil Spirits, and that many, with our SAVIOUR'S
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0324300200:74"/>
Diſciples, have been <hi>affrighted and cried out,</hi> not only with ſuppoſing they had ſeen, but really with ſeeing a Spirit. Of this the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all Ages, and Scripture it ſelf are a ſufficient Demonſtration.</p>
               <p>What then could theſe have ordinarily been, but the Appearances of ſome of thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> or Darkneſs? For I am far from thinking that either the Ghoſts of the Damn'd or the Happy, either the Soul of a <hi>Dives</hi> or a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> returns here any more. For as <hi>St. Athanaſius</hi> obſerves,<note n="*" place="bottom">Hai en tois naois, <hi>&amp;c. Athan.</hi> Tom. 2. P. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe Viſions and Shades of the Saints, which appear in the Temples and at the Tombs, are not the Souls of the Saints themſelves, but the good Angels appearing in their Shapes.</hi> Not that GOD could not remand the Ghoſt of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and order it again to viſit the Earth, as he made <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at our SAVIOUR'S Transfiguration; but that a Thing of this Nature was very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſeldom happen'd.</p>
               <p>Taking it therefore for granted, that there have been Apparitions of Angels, I believe it will alſo be owned, that theſe Apparitions have frequently happen'd in the Night. And truly, was there no direct Proof of this, yet the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their appearing in the Night, being as it were link'd and chained to our Idea of an
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0324300200:75"/>
Apparition, would almoſt perſwade us, that the Night is the moſt proper Time for ſuch Appearances. Whether it is, that the Fables of Nurſes,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Lock,</hi> on Human Underſt.</note> as an ingenious Author imagines, <q>have ſo aſſociated the Idea of Spirit to the Night, that the one never appears with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other;</q> or whether there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Preſence of Night, ſome Awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Horrour, which naturally diſpoſe the Mind of Man to theſe Reflections. I am indeed very inclinable to believe, that theſe Legendary Stories of Nurſes and old Women, are the Occaſion of much greater Fears, than People without them, would generally have of theſe Things; but I cannot help thinking, that the Preſence of Night, would naturally lead a Man to ſome Reflection of Spirits, without any ſuch Cauſe as that learned Author men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. There are ſome particular Times, which will naturally raiſe ſome particular Thoughts: Thus on a bright ſunny Day we are naturally diſpoſed to Mirth and Gaiety; when the Day over-caſts, or the Weather is hazy, we then turn indolent and dull, and ſooth our ſelves in Melancholly; if it Thunder and Lighten, we think of the Day of Judgment and ſudden Death: And thus alſo the Night, as it inclines us to grave and ſerious Thoughts, raiſes in us
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0324300200:76"/>
Horrour and Diſmay, and makes us afraid, even when our Judgment tells us there is no Fear; ſo it may of it ſelf be look'd upon as a natural Cauſe of ſuch Reflections.</p>
               <p>But however this be, we muſt neceſſarily own, that Spirits have frequently appeared in the Night, or we muſt give the Lye to the Traditions of all Ages, to Hiſtorians prophane and ſacred, and the wiſeſt and beſt in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of Men.</p>
               <p>In the Heathen World there are many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of which I ſhall only mention this one out of <hi>Plutarch:</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">In Vit. Mar. <hi>Brut.</hi> Tranſ. Duke.</note> One Night, before <hi>Brutus</hi> paſſed out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> he was very late all alone in his Tent, with a dim Light burning by him, all the Reſt of the Army being huſht and ſilent; and muſing with himſelf, and very thoughtful, as he turn'd his Eye to the Door, he ſaw a ſtrange and terrible Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, of a prodigious and frightful Body coming towards him without ſpeaking. <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> boldly aſked him, What art thou? Man, or God? Or upon what Buſineſs do'ſt thou come to us? The Spirit anſwer'd, I am thy <hi>Evil Genius,</hi> thou ſhalt ſee me at <hi>Philippi;</hi> to which <hi>Brutus</hi> not at all diſturbed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, Then I will ſee thee there.</q>
               </p>

               <p>But though it be true from Scripture, that there have been nightly Apparitions, yet theſe are chiefly of good Angels; whereas this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion principally means, the Appearances of evil Spirits. It muſt be owned indeed, that the Appearances of evil Spirits, if litterally, are yet but very ſeldom mention'd in the Night in Scripture; but however, that they wander and appear at Night, is very deducible from, if not litterally mentioned in it. Their's <hi>is the Land of Darkneſs, and the Shadow of Death; They are reſerved under Chains of Darkneſs to the Judgment of the great Day; and we know that every one that doth Evil naturally hateth the Light: They therefore love Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds are Evil.</hi> The Night therefore, in a more eſpecial Manner, ſeems to be their <hi>Hour,</hi> and the <hi>Power of Darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as may be learned from the Fear of the Apoſtles, when

Spirits was ſo great, that but few, and theſe too Men of Age and unſhaken Reſolution, were able to endure the Life in the Deſart. For ſuch was their Fierceneſs, that where Eight or Ten had been together in a Monaſtery, they would have made frequent and viſible Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: Inſomuch, that they never all ſlept at the ſame Time, but took it by Turns; ſome watching the Reſt, and exerciſing themſelves in ſinging Pſalms, in Praying and Reading.

C. 16.</note> That as ſoon as the Morn approached, they all vaniſhed and fled away. By this we ſee, that this was a current Opinion at this Time of Day; but what Reaſon they had for it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome Relations of the diſappearing of Evil Spirits at that Hour, I never yet have met with: But there have been produc'd at that Time of Night, Things of very memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Worth, which might perhaps raiſe the pious Credulity of ſome Men to imagine, that there was ſomething more in it, than in other Times. It was about the Time of Cock-crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when our Saviour was born, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſung the firſt Chriſtmas-Carol to the poor Shepherds, in the Fields of <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> Now
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0324300200:82"/>
it may be preſum'd, that as the Saviour of the World was then born, and the <hi>heavenly Hoſt</hi> had then deſcended to proclaim the News, that the Angels of Darkneſs would be terrified and confounded, and immediately fly away: And perhaps this Conſideration has partly been the Foundation of this Opinion; for as this may eaſily be ſuppoſed, ſo perhaps it has been ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, that the Spirits of Darkneſs, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in Memory that fatal Hour, are ſtartled and frighted away as the Cock proclaims it.</p>
               <p>It was alſo about this Time when he roſe from the Dead. And when the great <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> was riſen upon the World, no Wonder that all the Clouds of Darkneſs and Wickedneſs were diſpell'd; no Wonder that the conquer'd Powers of Hell were not able to ſhew their Heads: And this perhaps hath been another Reaſon of their imagining that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits go away at that Time.</p>
               <p>A third Reaſon is, that Paſſage in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where Jacob <hi>wreſtled with the Angel for a Bleſſing;</hi> where the Angel ſays unto him,<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xxxii.</note> 
                  <hi>Let me go, for the Day breaketh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But indeed this Tradition ſeems more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to have riſen from ſome particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending the Time of Cock-crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and which, as <hi>Prudentius</hi> ſeems to ſay
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0324300200:83"/>
above, are an Emblem of the Approach of the Day of the Reſurrection. For when we leave the World, we lie down in our Graves, and <hi>Reſt from our Labours:</hi> Sleep and Darkneſs lay hold upon us, and there we abide till the laſt Day appear, when the Voice of the Arch-Angel ſhall awake us, that we may meet the LORD of Light and Day. And when we leave the common Buſineſs and Care of Life, we lie down in our Beds, as in a Grave, buried as it were in Sleep and Darkneſs, till the Cock crow, the welcome Meſſenger of the News of Day.</p>
               <p>The Circumſtances therefore of the Time of Cock-crowing, being ſo natural a Figure and Repreſentation of the Morning of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; the Night ſo ſhadowing out the Night of the Grave; the third Watch, being as ſome ſuppoſe, the Time our Saviour will come to Judgment at; the Noiſe of the <hi>Cock</hi> awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſleepy Man, and telling him as it were, <hi>the Night is far ſpent, the Day is at Hand;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting ſo naturally the Voice of the Arch-Angel awakening the Dead, and calling up the Righteous to everlaſting Day; ſo natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does the Time of Cock-crowing ſhadow out theſe Things, that probably ſome good well-meaning Men, have been brought to believe, that the very Devils themſelves, when the Cock crew, and reminded them of them, did fear and tremble, and ſhun the Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0324300200:84"/>Now in Anſwer to the firſt of theſe Conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: 'Tis very likely the Evil Spirits did fly away in the Morning of the Nativity, and becauſe of our Saviour's Birth and that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the heavenly Hoſt,</hi> might be afraid and retire into thick Darkneſs; yet it will not hence follow, that it always happens ſo at the Time of Cock-crowing: For if they did fly away that Morning, the Circumſtances of our Saviour's Birth, the heavenly Glory of the Angelick Quire, their Muſick and their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence were the Occaſion of it: And why only the bare Remembrance of what happened at that Time, ſhould always at the Time of Cock-crowing drive them away, rather than when they remember it at another, no Reaſon ſeems to be given.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond Conjecture, namely, That it was the Time of our Saviour's Riſing from the Dead, I anſwer in the ſame Manner, That tho' it be allowed, that the Evil Spirits might have returned to the Land of Darkneſs, upon our Saviour's Riſing from the Dead; yet why it ſhould occaſion them always to do ſo at that Time, no Reaſon can be given.</p>
               <p>As to the third Conjecture, it is eaſy to obſerve, That this was a good Angel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they that ſhun the Light, are bad ones: This was the Angel of the Covenant, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of Light, and the Lord of the Day: We
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0324300200:85"/>
may therefore as well imagine, that it was not in his Power, to get out of the Arms of <hi>Jacob,</hi> without ſaying, <hi>Let me go;</hi> as to ſuppoſe he was obliged to go, becauſe he ſaid <hi>the Day breaketh.</hi> The meaning of which Words, <q>According to <hi>Willet,</hi> is not that the Angel was gone to the bleſſed Company of the Angels, to ſing their Morning Hymn to GOD, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> imagine: For the Angels, not only in the Morning, but at other Times, are exerciſed in praiſing GOD. But the Angel thus ſpeaketh according to the Cuſtom of Men, having now taken the Form and Shape of a Man, as tho' he had haſt to other Buſineſs, and leaving <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo to his Affairs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt Conjecture of the Riſe of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſeems to carry greater Probability than the others: For as theſe Things are a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Circumſtances of the Morning of the Reſurrection, ſo they muſt ſure enough bring that laſt Day into Remembrance; and they never can do ſo, but as ſurely they muſt create Terrour and Confuſion in all the Devils and Ghoſts of the Night: Whilſt they aſſure them they ſhall never any more enjoy the Realms of Bliſs, but be hurried into that<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxv. 41.</note>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0324300200:86"/>
Angels.</hi> But that theſe Things are the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their flying away at the Approach of Day, is not to be ſuppoſed. On the contrary, the Devil and his Angels ramble o'er the World in Day-light, and are Mid-day Devils, as well as Mid-night ones: For the Devil is inceſſant in his Temptations, and therefore he is abroad in the Day as well as the Night, tho' perhaps has ſeldom appear'd but in Darkneſs. Thus St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in one of his Meditations,<note n="*" place="bottom">Et ideo Deus meus ad te clamamus, libera nos ab ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſario noſtro quotidiano, qui ſive dormiamus, ſive vigile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,—die ac nocte fraudibus &amp; artibus, nunc palam nunc occulte ſagittas venenatas contra nos dirigens, ut interficiat animas noſtras. <hi>Aug. Sol. Cap.</hi> 16.</note> We implore thee, O GOD! that thou wouldeſt deliver us from our daily Enemy, who by his Wiles and Cunning is always watching us, Day and Night, ſleeping and waking; and both openly and in ſecret, ſhooting at us his poiſoned Arrows, that he may deſtroy our Souls.</p>
               <p>And now, what, though this be true, as it moſt certainly ſeems to be ſo, that at the chearful Hour of Cock-crowing, the wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ghoſts are not driven away, but ſtill continue going too and fro? What, tho' then their Power be ſtill the ſame, and their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as fully bent to do Evil? Conſider but that GOD'S Care and Providence govern the World, and there will be found as much Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for us, in the Midſt of Evil Spirits, as if
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0324300200:87"/>
they abſented at that Time. The Almighty Power of GOD, is the ſame then, as at other Times; nothing but that, preſerved us conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and that, will always be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us. However great may be the Malice of Devils; however deſirous of working our Ruin; tho' they watch all Opportunities, and are unwearied in tempting us; <hi>yet the loving Kindneſs of the LORD endureth for Ever, and his Mercy is over all his Works: He will not ſuffer our Foot to be moved; he that keepeth us will not ſleep: We ſhall not be afraid of the Sun by Day, nor the Moon by Night: For the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that walketh in Darkneſs, nor for the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that deſtroyeth in the Noon-day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are we then afraid of Darkneſs and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Night? Let us remember the Creator of them, and have but Faith in him, and we ſhall find <hi>our Night turned into Day. In his Light ſhall we ſee Light:</hi> We ſhall be as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure as if there was no Darkneſs about us, as well knowing that that GOD which protects us, ſees through the thickeſt <hi>Mediums,</hi> and the darkeſt Night: <hi>For with him the Darkneſs is no Darkneſs, but the Night is as clear as the Day; the Darkneſs and Light to him are both alike.</hi> Or are we afraid of that old Serpent the Devil, that nightly Rambler of the World, who is a Lover of Night and Darkneſs? Let us truſt in GOD, and no Harm ſhall happen
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0324300200:88"/>
to us. If we will but <hi>fear no Evil, his Rod and his Staff ſhall comfort us, though we walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death: For GOD hath reſerved the Devil and his Angels in everlaſting Chains, under Darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the great Day.</hi> Though therefore he is permitted to wander the World, yet he is ſo chain'd up, that without GOD'S parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Order or Permiſſion, he is not allowed to touch the Sons of Men; and he is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and kept in Darkneſs, that it is not in his Power even barely to appear and be viſible to them, without the Permiſſion of GOD: So little Reaſon hath every good Man to fear the Spight and Malice of all the Devils in Hell.</p>
               <p>When then the Night pours out her Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, covers all Things with Darkneſs, and ſtrikes thee with Horrour; <hi>Lift but up thy Eyes to the Hills, from whence cometh thy Help,</hi> and thou ſhalt clearly ſee, that our <hi>Lord GOD is a Light and Defence to thee.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Church-yards; why the Vulgar are generally afraid of paſſing through them at Night: The Original of this Fear: That there is nothing in them now, more than in other Places to be afraid of.</head>
               <p>THE moſt of ignorant People are afraid of going through a <hi>Church-Yard</hi> at Night-time. If they are obliged upon ſome haſty and urgent Affair, they fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, till they are beyond its Bounds, but they generally avoid it, and go further about. It would, no Queſtion, be better if there were fewer <hi>Path-ways</hi> through Church-Yards than there are, both as it would prevent ſeveral <hi>Abuſes</hi> committed in them, and alſo cauſe the Aſhes of the Dead to be in greater Quiet, and more undiſturbed Peace: We ſhould not then ſee Church-Yards changed into common Dung-hills, nor ſhould we tread ſo frequently upon the Bones of our Friends: But when for the Conveniency of Neighbourhood, or other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, there are allowed public Ways, it is a very great Weakneſs to be afraid of paſſing through them.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this Fear is, a Notion they have imbib'd, that in <hi>Church-Yards</hi> there is a frequent walking of Spirits at the <hi>Dead-time</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0324300200:95"/>
of Night. Indeed there is at that Time ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing awful and horrible every where, and it muſt be confeſs'd ſomething more ſolemn in a <hi>Church-Yard,</hi> than in the Generality of other Places; but that it is then more frequented with <hi>Apparitions and Ghoſts</hi> than other Places are, is at this Time of Day intirely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and without any Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The Original of this Timorouſneſs may be deduc'd from the Heathens: For they believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the <hi>departed Ghoſts</hi> came out of their <hi>Tombs</hi> and <hi>Sepulchres,</hi> and wander'd about the Place where the Body lay buried.

               <p>It having therefore been a current Opinion of the Heathens, that <hi>Places of Burial and Church-Yards</hi> were frequently haunted with <hi>Spectres</hi> and <hi>Apparitions,</hi> it is eaſy to imagine, that the Opinion has been handed from them, among the Ignorant and unlearned, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Ages of Chriſtianity to the preſent Day.

what Reaſon it ſhould be ſuppoſed, <q>(<note n="*" place="bottom">Scot.

For the Soul upon the Departure, <hi>returns to GOD that gave it,</hi> who allots it its Station in the World of Spirits, where it is kept till the Day of Judgment in Happineſs or Miſery, when it ſhall receive its Compleation of the one, or the other.

               <p>IN the dark Ages of <hi>Popery,</hi> it was a Cuſtom, if any <hi>Well</hi> had an awful Situation, and was ſeated in ſome lonely melancholy Vale; if its Water was clear and limpid, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully<note n="*" place="bottom">—Viridi ſi margine clauderet undas.—Herba.— <hi>Juven. Sat.</hi> 3.</note> margin'd with the tender Graſs; or if it was look'd upon, as having a Medicinal Quality; to gift it to ſome <hi>Saint,</hi> and honour it with his Name. Hence it is, that we have at this Day Wells and Fountains called, ſome St. <hi>John</hi>'s, St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s, St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s <hi>Well,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To theſe kind of Wells, the common People are accuſtomed to go, on a Summer's Evening, to refreſh themſelves with a <hi>Walk</hi> after the Toil of the Day, to drink the Water of the Fountain, and enjoy the pleaſing Proſpect of Shade and Stream.</p>
               <p>Now this Cuſtom (tho' at this Time of Day, very commendable, and harmleſs, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent) ſeems to be the Remains of that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Practice of the Papiſts, of paying

               <p>The giving of Names to Wells, is of great Antiquity: We find it a Cuſtom in the Days of the old Patriarchs. <hi>Abraham</hi> obſerved this Cuſtom; and therefore the Well, which he

               <p>OMENS and Prognoſtications of Things are ſtill in the Mouths of all, though only obſerved by the Vulgar. In Country Places eſpecially, they are in great Repute, and are the Directors of ſeveral Actions of Life; being looked on by them as Preſages of Things future, or the Determiners of preſent Good or Evil: If<note n="*" place="bottom">Lepus quoque occurrens in via, infortunatum iter prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagit &amp; ominoſum. <hi>Alex. ab Alex.

Lib.</hi> 1.</note> who never went upon any Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, nor undertook any Buſineſs of Moment, without conſulting the Augurs and Wiſe-Men, and being guided by Omens and Preſages of Things. Hence it was that they conſulted the Intrails of Beaſts, the Flights of Birds, and ſeveral other Things: And that the very Things above-mentioned, as the Authorities there declare, have been obſerved by them; yea, they have obſerv'd them, even in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt Ages, beyond the Days of the oldeſt Records. The Heathen World therefore was full of them, and without all doubt they have been handed down to us from theſe Times.</p>
               <p>And as it is not to be queſtion'd, but we had them from the Heathens, ſo in all Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility the Heathens have taken them from the People of GOD, and built many of their Folies and ominous Superſtitions on a Cuſtom which they alone were indulged in. For in the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Age of the World, when a Matter of any great Conſequence was depending, and the Servants of GOD would know what the Event would be, they aſked a <hi>Sign</hi> of GOD, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0324300200:107"/>
that ſuch a Thing might happen, if they were to ſucceed, and God was ſometimes ſo condeſcending as to grant them their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Thus we read, That<note n="*" place="bottom">Sam. i. 14. iii. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Jonathan</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd only by his Armour Bearer, not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Steepneſs of the Rocks, nor Multitudes of Enemies, attempted the Garriſon of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> and conquered, through a Token of this Nature. <hi>If they ſay,</hi> ſays he to his Armour-Bearer, <hi>Tarry untill we come up, then we will ſtand ſtill in our Place, and will not go up unto them; but if they ſay come up unto us, then we will go up; for the LORD hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them into our Hands, and this ſhall be a Sign unto us.</hi> And ſo indeed it came to paſs, GOD who had inſpired <hi>Jonathan</hi> with this Thought, directing the Tongues of the others according to his Wiſhes. In like Manner, when the good old Servant of <hi>Abraham</hi> had arrived at the City of <hi>Nahor,</hi> to find a Wife for his Maſter's Son; we have him deſiring of GOD, that the Sign of the Woman he ſhould pitch upon, might be her ſaying, <hi>Drink, and I will give thy Camels Drink alſo.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. xxiv. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Ana he ſaid, O Lord GOD of my Maſter</hi> Abraham, <hi>I pray thee ſend me good Speed this Day, and ſhew Kindneſs unto my Maſter</hi> Abraham: <hi>Behold, I ſtand here by the Well of Water, and the Daughters of the

Men of the City came out to draw Water. And let it come to paſs, that the Damſel to whom I ſhall ſay, let down thy Pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and ſhe ſhall ſay, Drink, and I will give thy Camels Drink alſo: Let the ſame be ſhe that thou haſt appointed for thy Servant</hi> Iſaac; <hi>and thereby ſhall I know that thou haſt ſhewed Kindneſs unto my Maſter.</hi> This happened ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Prayer, by which he knew that the LORD had proſpered his Journey. Now this Cuſtom we know the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> imitated, when they would know whether they had been afflicted by the GOD of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ark.<note n="*" place="bottom">Sam. i. 6, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>They took the Ark of the LORD, and laid it on a Cart, and ſent it away. And they ſaid, If it goeth by the Way of his own Coaſt to</hi> Beth-ſhemoth, <hi>then he hath done us this great Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe early Ages of the World, GOD per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch Things upon extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to be aſked by his own People. But they were only peculiar to thoſe Times. We have no Warrant for doing the like: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not us to preſcribe Means to GOD, by which we may judge of our future Succeſs, but to depend on his Power and Wiſdom, his Care and Providence. The Obſervation of Omens, ſuch as the falling of Salt, a Hare

For by ſuch Obſervations as theſe, they are the Slaves of Superſtition and Sin, and have all the While no true Dependance upon GOD, no Truſt in his Providence.</p>

ſulphureous Spirits, as it happens oftentimes in Mines.—He admits that Conjectures of <hi>prevalent Humours</hi> may be collected from <hi>the Spots</hi> in our <hi>Nails,</hi> but rejects the ſundry Divinations vulgarly raiſed upon them; ſuch as, that <hi>Spots</hi> in the <hi>Top</hi> of the Nails ſignify <hi>Things paſt;</hi> in the <hi>Middle, Things preſent;</hi> and at the <hi>Bottom, Events to come;</hi> —that <hi>white</hi> Specks preſage our <hi>Felicity; blue</hi> ones our <hi>Misfortunes;</hi> thoſe in the <hi>Nail</hi> of the <hi>Thumb</hi> have Significations of <hi>Honour;</hi> of the <hi>Forefinger, Riches.

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Country Converſation in a Winter's Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Their Opinions of Spirits and Apparitions; of the Devil's appearing with a cloven Foot; of Fairies and Hobgoblins; of the walking Places of Spirits; and of haunted Houſes.</head>
               <p>NOthing is commoner in <hi>Country Places,</hi> than for a whole Family in a <hi>Winter's Evening,</hi> to ſit round the Fire, and tell Stories of Apparitions and Ghoſts. And no Queſtion of it, but this adds to the natural Fearfulneſs of Men, and makes them many Times ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they ſee Things, which really are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their own Fancy. From this, and ſeldom any other Cauſe, it is, that <hi>Herds</hi> and <hi>Shepherds</hi> have all of them ſeen <hi>frequent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions,</hi> and are generally ſo well ſtock'd with Stories of their own Knowledge. Some of them have ſeen <hi>Fairies,</hi> ſome <hi>Spirits</hi> in the Shapes of <hi>Cows</hi> and <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Horſes;</hi> and ſome have ſeen even the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf, with a <hi>cloven Foot.</hi> All which, is either <hi>Hearſay</hi> or a <hi>ſtrong Imagination.</hi> Not that there have not been, or may not be Apparitions; we know that there have undoubtedly been ſuch Things, and that there ſtill are, upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Occaſions; but that almoſt all the Stories of Ghoſts and Spirits, are grounded on no
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0324300200:121"/>
other Bottom, than the Fears and Fancies, and weak Brains of Men.</p>
               <p>In their Account of the Apparition of the Devil, they always deſcribe him with a <hi>cloven Foot:</hi> That is always his diſtinguiſhing Badge, whatever Shape he appears in; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in Beauty or Deformity, he never appears without it. Such is the old Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have received of his appearing, and ſuch is their Belief of it.</p>
               <p>Indeed it muſt be confeſs'd, that this is not ſo improbable and ridiculous as many Things they hold. For tho' perhaps few of them have ought elſe for this Opinion, but <hi>old Wives Fables,</hi> or the Picture of the Devil, which they have always obſerved drawn with a cloven Foot, yet there ſeems to be ſome Truth in it. For in the Times of frequent Apparitions, the Devil was wont to appear ſo, if we may believe Antiquity; and there is alſo ſome Reaſon for it, conſidering the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the fallen Angels.</p>
               <p>The<note n="*" place="bottom">Brown's Vulg. Err.</note> Author of the <hi>Vulgar Errors</hi> upon this ſame Subject, hath theſe Words. <q>The Ground of this Opinion at firſt, might be his frequent appearing in the Shape of a Goat, which anſwers this Deſcription. This was the Opinion of the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0324300200:122"/>
concerning the Apparitions of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Fauns</hi> and <hi>Satyrs;</hi> and of this Form we read of one, that appeared to <hi>Anthony</hi> in the Wilderneſs. The ſame is alſo confirmed from Expoſitions of Holy Scripture. For whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not offer unto Devils:</hi> The original Word is <hi>Seghnirim;</hi> that is, <hi>rough and hairy Goats,</hi> becauſe in that Shape the Devil moſt often appeared, as is expounded by the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> as <hi>Tremellius</hi> hath alſo explain'd, and as the Word <hi>Aſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> the God of <hi>Emath</hi> is by ſome conceived. He obſerves alſo, That the <hi>Goat</hi> was the Emblem of the <hi>Sin Offering,</hi> and is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of Sinful Men at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And of this Opinion was alſo the learned Mr.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mede, Diſ. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>Mede.</hi> He ſays, <q>That when Spirits converſe with Men, it is under ſome viſible Shape, and that there is a Law given them that that Shape they aſſum'd, ſhould be of ſomething which more or leſs reſembled their Condition. For as in Nature we ſee every Thing hath a ſeveral and ſuitable <hi>Phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> as a Badge of their inward Nature, whereby it is known, as by a Habit of Diſtinction, ſo it ſeems to be in the Shapes and Apparitions of Spirits. And as in a well governed Common Wealth,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0324300200:123"/>
every Sort and Condition is known by a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Habit, agreeable to his Quality; ſo it ſeems it ſhould be in GOD'S great Common Wealth, concerning the Shapes which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits take upon them. And he that gave the Law, that a Man ſhould not wear the Habit of a Woman, nor a Woman the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a Man, becauſe that as he had made them diverſe, ſo would he have them ſo known by their Habits; ſo it ſeems he will not ſuffer a good and a bad Spirit, a noble and ignoble one, to appear unto Man after the ſame Faſhion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now from this it will follow, that good Angels can take upon them no other Shape, but the Shape of Man, becauſe their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Excellency is reſembled only in the moſt excellent of all viſible Creatures. The Shape of an inferior Creature would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable, no other Shape becoming thoſe who are called <hi>the Sons of GOD,</hi> but his only, who <hi>was created after GOD's own Image.</hi> And yet, not his neither as he now is, but according as he was before his Fall in his glorious Beauty of his Integrity. Age and Deformity are the Fruits of Sin; and the Angel in the Goſpel appears like a young Man, <hi>His</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. xxviii.</note> 
                     <hi>Countenance like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and his Raiment white as Snow,</hi> as it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0324300200:124"/>
were reſembling the Beauty of glorified Bodies, in Immutability, Sublimity and Purity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Hence alſo it follows on the contrary, that the Devil could not appear in humane Shape whilſt Man was in his Integrity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a Spirit fallen from his firſt glorious Perfection, and therefore muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſuch Shape, which might argue his Imperfection and Abaſement, which was the Shape of a Beaſt: Otherwiſe no Reaſon can be given, why he ſhould not rather have appeared to <hi>Eve</hi> in the Shape of a Woman, than of a Serpent; for ſo he might have gain'd an Opinion with her, both of more Excellency and Knowledge. But ſince the Fall of Man, the Caſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd; now we know he can take upon him the Shape of Man; and no Wonder, ſince one falling Star may reſemble another. And therefore he appears it ſeems in the Shape of Man's Imperfection, either for Age or Deformity, as like an old Man (for ſo the Witches ſay:) And perhaps it is not altogether falſe, which is vulgarly affirmed, that the Devil appearing in humane Shape, hath always a Deformity of ſome uncouth Member or other; as tho' he could not yet take upon him humane Shape intirely, for that Man himſelf, is not intirely and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fallen as he is.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0324300200:125"/>Thus far hath this great and learned Man given his Opinion of this Matter, and that with ſuch Strength of Reaſon and Argument, as leaves at leaſt a Probability behind it, of the Truth of this Opinion.</p>
               <p>Another Part of this Converſation generally turns upon <hi>Fairies.</hi> Theſe, they tell you, have frequently been heard and ſeen, nay that there are ſome ſtill living who were ſtolen away by them, and confined ſeven Years. According to the Deſcription they give of them, who pretend to have ſeen them, they are in the Shape of Men, exceeding little: They are always clad in Green, and frequent the Woods and Fields; when they make Cakes (which is a Work they have been often heard at) they are very noiſy; and when they have done, they are full of Mirth and Paſtime. But generally they dance in <hi>Moon-Light</hi> when Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are aſleep, and not capable of ſeeing them, as may be obſerved on the following Morn; their dancing Places being very diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For as they dance Hand in Hand, and ſo make a <hi>Circle</hi> in their Dance, ſo next Day there will be ſeen <hi>Rings</hi> and <hi>Circles</hi> on the Graſs.</p>
               <p>Now in all this there is really nothing, but an old fabulous Story, which has been handed down even to our Days from the Times of <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> of a certain Sort of Beings called
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0324300200:126"/>
                  <hi>Lamiae,</hi> which were eſteemed ſo miſchievous and cruel, as to take away young Children and ſlay them. Theſe, together with the <hi>the Fauns,</hi> the <hi>Gods of the Woods,</hi> ſeem to have formed the Notion of Fairies.</p>
               <p>This Opinion, in the benighted Ages of Popery, when <hi>Hobgoblins</hi> and <hi>Sprights</hi> were in every <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Village,</hi> by every <hi>Water</hi> and in every <hi>Wood,</hi> was very common. But when that Cloud was diſpell'd, and the Day ſprung up, thoſe Spirits which wander'd in the Night of Ignorance and Error, did real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſh at the Dawn of Truth and the Light of Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Another Tradition they hold, and which is often talk'd of, is, that there are particular Places alotted to Spirits to walk in. Thence it was that formerly, ſuch frequent Reports were abroad of this and that particular Place being haunted by a Spirit, and that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People ſay now and then, ſuch a Place is dangerous to be paſs'd through at Night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Spirit walks there. Nay, they'll fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell you, that ſome Spirits have lamented the Hardneſs of their Condition, in being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to walk in cold and uncomfortable Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and have therefore deſired the Perſon who was ſo hardy as to ſpeak to them, to gift them with a warmer Walk, by ſome well grown
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0324300200:127"/>
                  <hi>Hedge,</hi> or in ſome <hi>ſhady Vale,</hi> where they might be ſhelter'd from the Rain and Wind.</p>
               <p>The Stories, that Apparitions have been ſeen oftner than once in the ſame Place, have no Doubt been the Riſe and Spring of the walking Places of Spirits; but why they are ſaid ſometimes to cry out for Places that are more comfortable, is not ſo certainly known. It is however highly probable, that when the Ignorance and Superſtition of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, had filled the World with <hi>Apparitions</hi> and <hi>Ghoſts,</hi> that this alſo was invented among them. For they ſeem to have the moſt <hi>Right</hi> to an Invention of this Nature, whoſe Brains were ſo fruitful of Folly, as to invent that<note n="*" place="bottom">Fuller's Ch. Hiſt. Cen. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Dunſtan</hi> took the Devil by the Noſe, with a Pair of hot <hi>Tongs</hi> till he roar'd again. For if the Devil may be burnt, he may alſo be ſtarv'd; if he took ſuch Pains to get his Noſe out of the <hi>Pincers,</hi> without Doubt in a froſty Night, he would wiſh to be as warm as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He that believes the one, muſt neceſſarily believe the other. And therefore it very near amounts to a Demonſtration, who were the Authors of this Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Monks.</hi> We are ſure they invented the one, and need little queſtion but they invented the other.</p>
               <p>There is a Story in the Book of <hi>Tobit,</hi> (which they may believe that will) of the <hi>evil Spirits</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0324300200:128"/>
flying into the utmoſt Parts of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Tob. vi.</note> 
                  <hi>For as</hi> Tobias <hi>went in unto his Wife, he remembred the Words of</hi> Raphael, <hi>and took the Aſhes of the Perfumes, and put the Heart and Liver of the Fiſh thereupon, and made a Smoke therewith. The which Smell, when the evil Spirit had ſmelled, he fled unto the utmoſt Parts of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the Angel bound him.</hi> Now from this it is evident, that the Spirit was obliged to forſake his good old Quarters and warm Lodgings, for inhoſpitable Deſarts and open Air: And from this, perhaps, ſome of thoſe <hi>doting Monks</hi> have perſuaded themſelves into a Belief of theſe Things.</p>
               <p>When it is proved to us, that this Book of <hi>Tobit</hi> is the Word of GOD, we may entertain more Veneration for this vulgar Opinion; but till then, we muſt be indulg'd in wondering, how a Spirit, that is an <hi>immaterial Subſtance,</hi> can be affected with our Heat or Cold, or any Power or Quality of <hi>material Beings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt Topick of this Converſation I ſhall take Notice of, ſhall be the Tales of <hi>haunted</hi> Houſes. And indeed it is not to be wonder'd at, that this is never omitted. For formerly almoſt every Place had a Houſe of this Kind. If a Houſe was ſeated on ſome melancholly Place, or built in ſome old romantic Manner; or if any particular Accident had happen'd in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0324300200:129"/>
it, ſuch as Murder, ſudden Death, or the like, to be ſure that Houſe had a Mark ſet on it, and was afterwards eſteemed the Habitation of a Ghoſt. In talking upon this Point, they generally ſhow the Occaſion of the Houſe's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>haunted,</hi> the merry Pranks of the Spirit, and how it was laid. Stories of this Kind are infinite, and there are few <hi>Villages</hi> which have not either had ſuch an Houſe in it, or near it.</p>
               <p>And indeed there are Men of good Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Knowledge, who are as far as others from Superſtition, who are inclinable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſuch Things have been upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Emergencies; tho', among the Stories that are told, they believe not one in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. They know that Spirits have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared to Men out of Houſes, and they can ſee no Reaſon why they may not have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in them: They know nothing in an Houſe more than in another Place, to prevent an Apparition, but an equal Help to its Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. The Air, which a Ghoſt is ſuppoſed to be wrapped in, when it becomes viſible to Men, is there to be found, and they know of nothing elſe that may be an Argument againſt it. An Author of good Credit tells us,<note n="*" place="bottom">Cum <hi>Romae</hi> aegra valetudine oppreſſus forem, jaceremque in lectulo, ſpeciem mulieris eleganti forma mihi plane vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanti obſervatam fuiſſe, quam cum inſpicerem, diu cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundus, &amp;c.—Cum meos ſenſus vigere, &amp; figuram illam nuſquam a me dilabi, &amp;c. <hi>Alex. ab Alex. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 9.</note> That
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0324300200:130"/>
when he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was taken with Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and obliged to keep his Bed: As he lay in this Condition, he obſerved, as he was once awake, a <hi>Woman</hi> of a very beautiful Perſon coming towards him. Upon this he was ſilent for ſome Time, and very thoughtful, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the while with himſelf, whether it was not rather a <hi>deceptio viſus</hi> than a real Being. But when he perceived his Senſes ſound and intire, and that the Object ſtill continued; he aſked, What ſhe was? In Anſwer to which, ſhe repeated the very Words he had ſpoken to her, in a ſneering and diſdainful Manner. After ſhe had taken a good View of him, ſhe departed.</p>
               <p>The Commentator upon this Place, ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Sed haec ſemper mera ſomnia eſſe putavi. <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </note> He looks upon this Story, and the reſt which are mentioned along with it, to be nothing but Dreams and Fancies. And for ought that I know to the contrary, they may be ſo; but however it muſt be confeſs'd, this Story in particular is well atteſted, being told by the Man himſelf, who was a great and a learned Man, and who, if we may believe himſelf, ſeems to be as ſure that he had his Eyes open, as the Commentator can be of the contrary.</p>
               <p>But whatever Truth there may be in it, it is certain that in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they are perſuaded of the Truth of it, to a Fault.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0324300200:131"/>
For they are ſo ſure of it, that they have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Forms of <hi>exorciſing</hi> ſuch Houſes; which becauſe they have often been heard of, but ſeldom ſeen; and are thoſe very Things which raiſed, in the Vulgar formerly, ſuch an Opinion of their ignorant Prieſts, as to make them be eſteemed Men of the greateſt Faith and Learning; and becauſe alſo the Opinion has reached even our Days, and 'tis common for the preſent Vulgar to ſay, none can lay a Spirit but a <hi>Popiſh Prieſt;</hi> it ſhall be the Buſineſs of the next Chapter, to give one of thoſe Forms of <hi>exorciſing</hi> an Houſe; not that they are envied for their Art of <hi>conjuring,</hi> but that it may be ſeen, how well they deſerve the Character they go under.</p>

who came once, in his Abſence, to his Preſbyters, and begg'd their Aſſiſtance. Upon which one of them went along with him; and when he had offer'd the Sacrifice of the Body of CHRIST, and prayed in a moſt fervent Manner, the Houſe, by the Mercy of GOD, was no longer troubled.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of <hi>Saturday</hi> Afternoon; how obſerved of old, by the ancient Chriſtians, the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the old Church of <hi>England:</hi> What End we ſhould obſerve it for: An Exhortation to the Obſervation of it.</head>
               <p>IT is uſual, in Country Places and Villages, where the Politeneſs of the Age hath made no great Conqueſt, to obſerve ſome particular Times with ſome Ceremonies, which were cuſtomary in the Days of our Fore-fathers: Such are the great Feſtivals of Chriſtmas, Eaſter, and ſeveral others, which they obſerve with Rites and Cuſtoms appropriated to them.</p>
               <p>Among theſe we find a great Deference paid to <hi>Saturday Afternoon,</hi> above the other worky Days of the Week: Then the Labours of the Plough ceaſt, and Refreſhment and Eaſe are over all the Village.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to be the Remains of a laudable Cuſtom once in this Land (but now almoſt buried in that general Contempt of Religion and Love of the World, which prevail ſo much every where) of attending the Evening Prayers on Saturday, and laying aſide the Concerns of this Life, to be fitter for the Duties of the

                  <q>it was an holy Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom among our Fore-fathers, when at the Ringing to Prayer the <hi>Eve</hi> before the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> the <hi>Husbandman</hi> would give over his Labour in the Field, and the <hi>Tradeſman</hi> his Work in the Shop, and go to Evening Prayer in the Church, to prepare their Souls, that their Minds might more chearfully attend <hi>GOD's Worſhip</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath-Day.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And indeed it was the Cuſtom both of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and the Chriſtian Church. They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them entred upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> without ſome Preparation for it. <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. xvi.

               <p>Among the primitive Chriſtians the LORD'S Day was always uſher'd in with a <hi>Pernoctation</hi> or <hi>Vigil.</hi> They aſſembled in the Houſe of GOD, and ſung Pſalms and Praiſes to him a great Part

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER XII.</head>
                  <p>THE religious Obſervation of the <hi>Saturday Afternoon</hi> is now entirely at an End I ſhould be happy, were I able to ſay with Truth that the Concluſion of that of the Sunday too did not ſeem to be approaching.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bourne uſes great Affectation in tranſlating the Quotation from Selden. He has printed the Latin erroneouſly too: It ought to be <q>in <hi>lunaris diei</hi> diliculum, &amp;c.</q> — The Sabbath was not to be obſerved from Saturday <hi>at Noon,</hi> but from <hi>three o'Clock</hi> on that Day in the <hi>Afternoon,</hi> and whatever Part of the Day might have been called <hi>Noon</hi> at the Time he alludes to, he might have hinted to us in a Note, without confounding it in his Text with the <hi>Mid-day</hi> of this Age.</p>
                  <p>To our Author's Account of the Cuſtom of the old Churches of England and Scotland, an <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> may be added, of which he ſeems never to have heard. It is, that in the Year 1332, at a Provincial Council, held by Archbiſhop Mepham, at Magfield, after Complaint made, that inſtead of faſting upon the Vigils, they ran out to all the Exceſſes of Riot, &amp;c. it was appointed, among many other Things relative to Holy Days, <q>that the Solemnity for Sunday ſhould begin upon <hi>Saturday</hi> in the <hi>Evening,</hi> and not before, to prevent the Miſconſtruction of keeping a Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

Sabbath<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Wheatly tells us, that in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> the Church thought ſit to indulge the Humour of the Judaizing Chriſtians ſo far, as to obſerve the <hi>Saturday</hi> as a Feſtival Day of Devotion, and thereon to meet for the Exerciſe of religious Duties,—as is plain from ſeveral Paſſages of the Antients. Illuſtration of Common Prayer, p. 191.</note>.</q> See Collier's Eccleſiaſtic Hiſt. Vol. I. p. 531.</p>
                  <p>Our Author's Exhortation towards the Concluſion of this Chapter is, I think, liable to Miſconſtruction: An <hi>Inference</hi> might eaſily be deduced from it in favour of Idleneſs.—Perhaps Men, who live by manual Labour, or have Families to ſupport by it, cannot better ſpend their <hi>Saturday Afternoon,</hi> than in following the ſeveral Callings, in which they have employed themſelves on the preceding Days of the Week.—Induſtry will be no bad Preparation to the Sabbath!</p>
                  <p>Conſidered in a Political View, much Harm hath been done by that prodigal <hi>Waſte</hi> of Days, very falſely called <hi>Holy Days,</hi> in the Church of Rome. They have greatly favoured the Cauſe of Vice and Diſſipation without doing any eſſential Service to that of rational Religion.—Complaints ſeem to have been made in almoſt every <hi>Synod</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> of the Licentiouſneſs introduced by the keeping of Vigils.—Nor will the Philoſopher wonder at this, for it has its Foundation in the Nature of Things<note n="†" place="bottom">For the Honour of human Nature, (which like the majeſtic Ruins of Palmyra, though proſtrate in the Duſt, is ſtill reſpectable in its Decay) I forbear to tranſlate the ſubſequent Quotation from Dr. Moreſin. <q>Et videre contigit.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Yule-Clog and Chriſtmas-Candle; what they may ſignifie; their Antiquity; the like Cuſtoms in other Places.</head>
               <p>IN the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> Chriſtmas-Day was always obſerv'd as the <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> was, and was in like Manner preceded by an <hi>Eve or Vigil.</hi> Hence it is that our Church hath ordered an <hi>Eve</hi> before it, which is obſerved by the Religious, as a Day of Preparation for that great Feſtival.</p>
               <p>Our Fore-Fathers, when the common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions of the <hi>Eve</hi> were over, and Night was come on, were wont to light up <hi>Candles</hi> of an uncommon Size, which were called <hi>Chriſtmas-Candles,</hi> and to lay a <hi>Log</hi> of Wood upon the Fire, which they termed a <hi>Yule-Clog,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtmas-Block.</hi> Theſe were to Illuminate the Houſe, and turn the Night into Day; which Cuſtom, in ſome Meaſure, is ſtill kept up in the Northern Parts.</p>
               <p>It hath, in all probability, been derived from the <hi>Saxons.</hi> For <hi>Bede</hi> tells us, That this very Night was obſerved in this Land before, by the <hi>Heathen Saxons.</hi> They<note n="*" place="bottom">Incipiebant autem annum ab octavo calendarum <hi>Januarii</hi> die, ubi nunc natale domini celebramus; &amp; ipſam noctem nuuc nobis ſacro-ſanctam tunc gentili vocabulo maedrenack, i. e. matrum noctem appellabant: Ob cauſam, ut ſuſpicamur, ceremoniarum, quas in ea pervigiles agebant. <hi>Beda de Rat.

of the Sun's Returning, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Days; ſo, I am apt to believe, the Log has had the Name of the <hi>Yule-Log,</hi> from its being burnt as an Emblem of the returning Sun, and the Increaſe of its Light and Heat.</p>
               <p>This was probably the Reaſon of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom among the <hi>Heathen Saxons;</hi> but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think the Obſervation of it was continued for the ſame Reaſon, after Chriſtianity was embraced. For Biſhop <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Origines Britanicae,</hi> 
                  <q>That though the ancient <hi>Saxons</hi> obſerved Twelve Days at that Time, and ſacrificed to the Sun, in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0324300200:176"/>
hopes of his Returning; yet when Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity prevailed, all theſe Idolatrous Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were laid aſide, and that Time of Feaſting was joined with the religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of that Seaſon, which in other Parts of the World were obſerved by Chriſtians.</q> And in like Manner as theſe Days of Feaſting were joined with the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Solemnities of that Seaſon, ſo the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of this Cuſtom, ſeems to have been done with another View, than it was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally. If a Conjecture may be allowed, it might have been done on Account of our Saviour's Birth, which happened that Night. For as the Burning of it before Chriſtianity, was an Emblem of the Coming of the Sun, which they worſhipped as their God; ſo the continuing it after, might have been for a Symbol of that Light, which was that Night born into the World: <hi>The Light that ſhineth in Darkneſs; the Light that lightned the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>that turn'd them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed it will be ſome ſtrengthening of the Conjecture, that Light has been the Emblem of ſeveral Things, both in Scripture, and in the ancient Church: For the Scripture makes uſe of it, and the Church in Imitation of the Scripture, as a lively Rereſentation of ſeveral Things. Thus Light is the Emblem of

                  </note> can be the meaning, ſays <hi>venerable Bede,</hi> that this Apparition of Angels was ſurrounded with that heavenly Light, which is a Thing we never meet with in all the Old Teſtament? For tho' Angels have appeared to Prophets and holy Men, yet we never read of their Appearing in ſuch Glory and Splendor before. It muſt ſurely be, becauſe this Privilege was reſerved for the Dignity of this Time. For when the true Light of the World, was born in the World, it was very proper that the Proclaimer of his Nativity, ſhould appear in the Eyes of Men, in ſuch an heavenly Light, as was before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen in the World. And that <hi>ſupernatural Star,</hi> which was the Guide of the <hi>Eaſtern Magi,</hi> was a Figure of that <hi>Star,</hi> which was riſen out of <hi>Jacob; of that Light which ſhould lighten the</hi> Gentiles. <q>GOD, ſays Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> ſent a miraculous Star, to invite and lead them to a new and more glorious Light, the Light of Grace and Glory,</q>

hence it was, that for the three or four Firſt <hi>Centuries,</hi> the whole <hi>Eaſtern Church,</hi> called the Day, which they obſerved for our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Nativity, the <hi>Epiphany</hi> or Manifeſtation of the Light.

               </p>
               <p>Light therefore having been an Emblem of ſo many Things, and particularly of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, both in the ſacred Hiſtory, and in the Practice of the Church; it is no way improbable, that after their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, the <hi>Saxons</hi> uſed it as an Emblem of him, who that Night came into the World,

and was the Light thereof. In the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> on the <hi>Eve of Eaſter,</hi> there was a Cuſtom practiſed, much like this of ours on <hi>Chriſtmas-Eve.</hi> For then the whole City was illuminated with Tapers and Torches, which continued all the Night, turning the Night into Day, till almoſt the Day appeared.

                        <p>Stiernhielm, habile dans les Langues &amp; dans les Antiquités du Nord. nous aprend, que les anciens Habitans de la Suéde célé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broient au <hi>Solſtice</hi> d'hyver ou à <hi>Noël,</hi> une fête, qu'ils appelloient <hi>Iul,</hi> que ce mot ſignifie <hi>Revolution, roue;</hi> que le Mois de Décembre s'en apelloit, <hi>Iul-manat,</hi> Mois du <hi>retour,</hi> &amp; que cet mot s'écrivoit également par <hi>Hiule</hi> &amp; <hi>Giule.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Les Habitans du Comté de Lincoln en Angleterre, appellent encore <hi>Gule-Block,</hi> Bloc, ou ſouche de <hi>Iul,</hi> la <hi>ſouche</hi> qu'on met au feu le jour de <hi>Noel,</hi> &amp; qui doit durer l'Octave entiere.</p>
                        <p>Il ne faudroit donc pas être étonné ſi notre Mois de <hi>Juillet</hi> qui ſuit le Solſtice d'Eté, eût pris ſon nom de là. Les Romains nous diſent, il eſt vrai, que ce Mois tira ſon Nom de Jules Céſar; ce pouroit être une Etymologie digne des Flatteries dont ils accabloient leurs Empereurs, tandis qu'ils n'auroient fait qu'altérer la Pronunciation du mot <hi>Iul</hi> pour le faire quadrer avec le Nom de <hi>Jules,</hi> qu'ils pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonçoient <hi>Iulus,</hi> Nom que porta auſſi Aſcagne, Fils d'Aenée, &amp; qui remontoit par là même aux Langues premieres de'l'Orient.</p>
                        <q>Il en aura été de même du Mois ſuivant.</q>
                        <p>S'ils choiſirent ces deux Mois pour leur faire porter les Noms du premier &amp; du ſecond de leurs Empereurs, ce fut premierement parce que les Noms de ces Mois avoient déja du raport à ceux de <hi>Jules</hi> &amp; d'<hi>Auguſte.</hi>
                        </p>

                  <p>The Caſe had been the ſame with the Month following.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As the Month of Auguſt was the firſt in the Egyptian Year, the firſt Day of it was called <hi>Gule,</hi> which being latinized makes <hi>Gula.</hi> Our Legenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſurprized at ſeeing this Word at the Head of the Month of Auguſt, did not overlook but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted it to their own Purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They made out of it the Feaſt of the Daughter of the Tribune Quirinus, cured of ſome Diſorder in her Throat (Gula is Latin for Throat) by kiſſing the <hi>Chains</hi> of St. Peter, whoſe Feaſt is ſolemnized on this Day.</p>

of the northern Nations.—He tells us, that the northern Goths and Swedes, have a Sport wherein they exerciſe their Youth, conſiſting of a Dance with Swords in the following Manner: Firſt with their Swords <hi>ſheathed</hi> and erect in their Hands, they dance in a triple Round. Then with their <hi>drawn</hi> Swords held erect as before: Afterwards extending them from Hand to Hand, they lay hold of each other's Hilt and Point, while they are wheeling more moderately round, and changing their Order, throw themſelves into the Figure of a <hi>Hexagon,</hi> which they call a Roſe.—But preſently raiſing and drawing back their Swords, they undo that Figure, to form (with them) a four-ſquare Roſe, that may rebound over the Head of each. At laſt they dance rapidly backwards, and vehemently rattling the Sides of their Swords together, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Sport. Pipes, or Songs (ſometimes both) direct the Meaſure, which at firſt is ſlow, but increaſing afterwards, becomes a very quick one, towards the Concluſion.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Chriſtmas Carol, an ancient Cuſtom: The common Obſervation of it very unbecoming.</head>
               <p>AS ſoon as the Morning of the <hi>Nativity</hi> appears, it is cuſtomary among the common People to ſing a <hi>Chriſtmas-Carol,</hi> which is a Song upon the Birth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and generally ſung with ſome<note n="*" place="bottom">Such are, <hi>The New-Year's Songs,</hi> and that whoſe Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is <hi>Hagmena.</hi> The Word <hi>Hagmena</hi> is the ſame as <hi>Hagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meene,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Month.

               </p>
               <p>This kind of Songs is of an ancient ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: They were ſung early in the Church it ſelf, in memory of the Nativity, as the many HYMNS for that Seaſon manifeſtly declare: <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays,<note n="†" place="bottom">Ut quiſque de ſcripturis ſanctis vel de proprio ingenio poteſt, provocatur in medium Deo cantare. <hi>Tertul.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0324300200:200"/>
make them ſing a Song unto <hi>GOD;</hi> either out of the Holy Scripture, or of their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and Invention. And as this was done at their Feaſts, ſo no doubt it was obſerved at the great Feaſt of the Nativity; which Song, no Queſtion of it, was to them, what the <hi>Chriſtmas-Carol</hi> ſhould be to us. In after Ages we have it alſo taken Notice of: For <hi>Durand</hi> tells us,<note n="*" place="bottom">In quibuſdam quoque locis.—In natali Praelati cum ſuis clericis ludant, vel in domibus epiſcopalibus: Ita ut etiam deſcendant.—Ad cantus. <hi>Durand.

               <p>The Reaſon of this Cuſtom ſeems to be an Imitation of the <hi>Gloria in Excelſis,</hi> or <hi>Glory be to GOD on High,</hi> &amp;c. which was ſung by the Angels, as they hovered o'er the Fields of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> in the Morning of the Nativity. For even that Song, as the learned Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> obſerves, was a Chriſtmas-Carol. <hi>As ſoon,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as theſe bleſſed Choriſters had ſung their Chriſtmas Carol, and taught the Church a Hymn, to put into her Offices for Ever, in the Anniverſary of this Feſtivity; the Angels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Was this performed with that Reverence and Decency, which are due to a Song of this Nature, in Honour of the Nativity, and Glory
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0324300200:201"/>
to our LORD, it would be very commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but to ſing it, as is generally done, in the midſt of <hi>Rioting and Chambering, and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toneſs,</hi> is no Honour, but Diſgrace; no Glory, but an Affront to that Holy Seaſon, a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to Religion, and a Sin againſt CHRIST.</p>

               <p>And no doubt, thoſe Chriſtians were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worthy of Cenſure, who imagined, as the Heathens did, that the ſending of a Preſent then, was any way <hi>Lucky,</hi> and an <hi>Omen</hi> of the Succeſs of the following Year. For this was the very Thing that made both ſeveral Holy Men, and ſome general Councils, take notice of, and forbid any ſuch Cuſtom; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Obſervance of it, out of any ſuch Deſign and View, was Superſtitious and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

               <p>Now the Original of this Cuſtom is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh, as appears by the Feaſting and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents before mentioned, which were a wiſh for a good Year.

               <p>But however I cannot ſee the Harm of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this ancient Ceremony, ſo it be not uſed ſuperſtitiouſly, nor attended with Obſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Lewdneſs. For then there will be no more in it, than an hearty Wiſh for each others Welfare and Proſperity; no more Harm, than wiſhing a good Day, or good Night; than in bidding one <hi>GOD ſpeed;</hi> or than in wiſhing to our Friend, what <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant did to himſelf, <hi>O</hi>

               <p>There is another Cuſtom obſerved at this Time, which is called among us <hi>Mumming;</hi> which is a changing of Clothes between Men and Women; who when dreſs'd in each others Habits, go from one Neighbour's Houſe to another, and partake of their <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-Cheer,</hi> and make merry with them in Diſguiſe, by dancing and ſinging, and ſuch like Merriments.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of the Twelfth Day; how obſerved: The Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of obſerving the Twelve Days after the common Way.</head>
               <p>ON the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> or <hi>Manifeſtation of</hi> Chriſt <hi>to the</hi> Gentiles, commonly called the Twelfth-Day, the <hi>Eaſtern Magi</hi> were guided by the Star, to pay their Homage to their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and becauſe they came that Day, which is the Twelfth after the Day of the Nativity, it is therefore called the <hi>Twelfth-Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Twelfth-Day it ſelf is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Twelve, and of more jovial Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation than the others, for the viſiting of Friends and Chriſtmas-Gambols. The Rites of this Day are different in divers Places, tho' the End of them is much the ſame in all; namely, to do Honour to the Memory of the <hi>Eaſtern Magi,</hi> whom they ſuppoſe to have been Kings. In<note n="*" place="bottom">In <hi>Gallia</hi> unus ex miniſtris, &amp;c.—Idem in <hi>Germania,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hoſpin. in Epiphan.</hi>

                  <hi>France,</hi> one of the Courtiers is choſen King, whom the King himſelf, and the other Nobles, attend at an Entertainment. In <hi>Germany,</hi> they obſerve the ſame Thing on this Day in Academies and Cities, where the Students and Citizens create one of themſelves <hi>King,</hi> and provide a Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0324300200:218"/>
Banquet for him, and give him the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of a <hi>King,</hi> or a <hi>ſtranger Gueſt.</hi> Now this is anſwerable to that Cuſtom of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnalia,</hi> of <hi>Maſters</hi> making <hi>Banquets</hi> for their <hi>Servants,</hi> and waiting on them; and no doubt this Cuſtom has in Part ſprung from that.</p>
               <p>Not many Years ago, this was a common <hi>Chriſtmas Gambol</hi> in both our <hi>Univerſities;</hi> and it is ſtill uſual in other Places of our Land, to give the Name of <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Queen</hi> to that Perſon, whoſe extraordinary Luck hits upon that Part of the divided <hi>Cake,</hi> which is honour'd above the others, with a <hi>Bean</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>But tho' this be generally the greateſt of the Twelve, yet the others preceding are obſerved with Mirth and Jollity, generally to Exceſs. Was this Feaſting confined within the Bounds of Decency and Moderation, and gave more Way than it does to the Exerciſes and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duties of the Seaſon, it would have nothing in it immoral or ſinful. The keeping up of Friendſhip, and Love, and old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, has nothing in it harmful; but the Misfortune is, Men upon that Bottom, act ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Brutes than Men, and like Heathens than Chriſtians; and the Preſervation of Friendſhip and Love, is nothing elſe but a Pretence for Drunkenneſs, and Rioting, and Wantonneſs. And ſuch I am afraid hath been the Obſervation of the Chriſtmas Holy-days,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0324300200:219"/>
ſince the holieſt Times of the Chriſtian Church; and the Generality of Men have rather look'd upon them, as a<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Biſhop <hi>Blackall</hi>'s Sermon on the Lawfulneſs and the right Manner of keeping Chriſtmas and other Chriſtian Feſtivals.</note> Time of Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Playing, than of returning Praiſes and Thankſgivings to GOD, for the greateſt Benefit he ever beſtow'd upon the Sons of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> in that excellent Oration of his upon Chriſtmas-Day, ſays, Let us not celebrate the Feaſt after an Earthly, but an Heavenly Manner; let not our Doors be crown'd; let not Dancing be encourag'd; let not the Croſs-paths be adorned, the Eyes fed, nor the Ears delighted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us not Feaſt to exceſs, nor be Drunk with Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From this we may clearly ſee, what has been the Cuſtom in theſe Days. And in all Probability it has been much the ſame among us, from the Beginning of Chriſtianity: However fabulous that Story may be, taken Notice of by<note n="†" place="bottom">Origin. Britan.

and that ſuch Jollity and Feaſting then, had its Original from him.</q> But however theſe Words, if true, may be a Teſtimony of the too great Antiquity of the Abuſe of this Feſtival; yet they will by no Means juſtifie <hi>Buchannan</hi>'s Comment upon them. For as the learned Biſhop goes on, <q>
                     <hi>Buchannan</hi> is ſo well pleaſed with this notable Obſervation, that He ſets it down for good Hiſtory, ſaying upon it, that the old <hi>Saturnalia</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd, only the Days increaſed, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>'s Name chang'd to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s: For ſays he, we call the Feaſt <hi>Julia.</hi> But why ſhould the Name of <hi>Saturn</hi> be changed into <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s? Was he worſhipped for a GOD among the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Chriſtians, as <hi>Saturn</hi> was among the old <hi>Pagans?</hi> But the Name <hi>Julia</hi> imports it; by no Means. For <hi>Buchannan</hi> does not prove, that this Name was ever uſed for that Feſtival among the <hi>Britains;</hi> and the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who brought in both the Name and the Feaſt, give another<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Chap.

                  <hi>Buchannan</hi> ſeems therefore to have a great deal more Malice than Truth on his Side. But however ſuch Revellings, and Frolicks, and Extravagances, whether or not derived from the old <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> as are cuſtomary at this Seaſon, do come very near to, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed its Liberties. In particular, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner at this Seaſon, than <hi>for Men to riſe early in the Morning, that they may follow ſtrong Drink, and continue untill Night, till Wine inflame them? As if CHRIST who came into the World to ſave us, and was manifeſted to deſtroy the Works of the Devil;</hi> was to be honour'd with the very Works he came to deſtroy.</p>
               <p>With ſome, <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> ends with the <hi>Twelve Days,</hi> but with the Generality of the Vulgar, not till <hi>Candlemas.</hi> Till then they continue Feaſting, and are ambitious of keeping ſome of their <hi>Chriſtmas-Chear,</hi> and then are fond of getting quit of it. <hi>Durand</hi> tells us,<note n="*" place="bottom">Hanc Quadrageſſimam cum gaudio celebramus, quia Chriſti incarnatio fuit gaudium angelorum &amp; hominum. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand.

               <p>THE Obſervation of the Weather which is made on this Day is altogether ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and ſuperſtitious. If it happen to be unclouded and without Rain, it is look'd upon as an Omen of the following Year's Succeſs, if otherwiſe, that the Year will be unfortunate. Thus the old Verſe.
<q>
                     <l>Clara dies <hi>Pauli,</hi> bona tempora denotat anni,</l>
                     <l>Si fuerint venti, denarrant praelia genti,</l>

               <p>The Interprepation of which is very well known to be this,
<q>
                     <l>If St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Day be fair and clear,</l>
                     <l>It doth betide a happy Year;</l>
                     <l>If bluſtering Winds do blow aloft</l>
                     <l>Then Wars will trouble our Realm full oft.</l>
                     <l>And if it chance to Snow or Rain,</l>

               <p>How St. <hi>Paul's Day</hi> came to have this particular Knack of foretelling the good or evil Fortune of the following Year, is no eaſy Matter to find out. The Monks who were undoubtedly the firſt who made this wonderful Obſervation, have taken Care it ſhould be handed down to Poſterity, but why and for what Reaſon this Obſervation was to ſtand good, they have taken Care to conceal. In Church Affairs indeed they make free with handing down <hi>Traditions</hi> from Generation to Generation, which being approved by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judgment, are to be taken for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but as far as I hear, they never pretended to an infallible Spirit, in the Study of the Planets. One may therefore, without the Suſpicion of Hereſy, or fear of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> make a little Inquiry into this Affair, and ſee whether it be true or falſe, whether it is built upon any Reaſon or no Reaſon, whether ſtill to be obſerved, or only laugh'd at as a Monkiſh Dream.</p>
               <p>Now as it is the Day of that Saint, <hi>the great Apoſtle St.</hi> Paul, I cannot ſee there is any Thing to be built upon. He did indeed <hi>labour
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0324300200:228"/>
more abundantly than all the Apoſtles;</hi> but never, that I heard, in the Science of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. And why his Day ſhould therefore be a ſtanding <hi>Almanack</hi> to the World, rather than the Day of any other <hi>Saint,</hi> will be pretty hard to find out. I am ſure there is a good Number of them, have as much Right to Rain or fair Weather as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and if St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> &amp;c. have not as much Right to Wind or Snow, let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>As it is the Twenty fifth Day of <hi>January,</hi> one would think that could be no Reaſon. For what is that Day more than another? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they do give ſome Shew of Reaſon, why Rain ſhould happen about the Time of St. <hi>Swithin,</hi> which is this. About the Time of his Feaſt, which is on the Fourteenth of <hi>July,</hi> there are two rainy <hi>Conſtellations,</hi> which are called <hi>Praecepe</hi> and <hi>Aſellus,</hi> which ariſe <hi>coſmically,</hi> and generally produce Rain. And to be ſure in the Courſe of the Sign <hi>Aquarius,</hi> there may be both Rain and Wind and fair Weather, but how theſe can foretell the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of the Year, is the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>As then there is nothing in the <hi>Saint,</hi> or his Day to prognoſticate any ſuch Thing, I mean, as it is the Day of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Twenty fifth of <hi>January,</hi> ſo I muſt confeſs I cannot find out what may be the Ground of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0324300200:229"/>
this particular Obſervation. But however thus much is very obvious, that this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is an exact Copy of that ſuperſtitious Cuſtom among the Heathens, of obſerving one Day as good, and another as bad. For among them were lucky and unlucky Days; ſome were <hi>dies atri,</hi> and ſome <hi>dies albi;</hi> the <hi>atri</hi> were pointed out in their <hi>Calendar,</hi> with a black Character, the <hi>albi</hi> with a white; the former to denote it a Day of bad Succeſs, the latter a Day of good. Thus have the <hi>Monks</hi> in the dark and unlearned Ages of Popery copy'd after the Heathens, and dream'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the like Superſtitions, eſteeming one Day more ſucceſsful than another; and ſo according to them, it is very unlucky to begin any Work upon <hi>Childermaſs-Day;</hi> and what Day ſoever that falls on, whether on a <hi>Munday, Tueſday,</hi> or any other, nothing muſt be begun on that Day through the Year; St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Day is the Year's <hi>Fortune-Teller,</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Day is the Prognoſticator of your Life and Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo inſtead of perſuading the People to lay aſide the Whims and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Heathen World, they brought them ſo effectually in, that they are ſtill reigning in many Places to this Day.</p>
               <p>But of all the Days of the Year, they could not have choſen one ſo little to the Purpoſe. For the very Saint, whoſe Day is ſo obſerved,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0324300200:230"/>
has himſelf cautioned them againſt any ſuch Obſervation: For in the Fourth Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galations,</hi> he tells them, how dangerous it was <hi>to obſerve Days, and Months, and Times, and Years;</hi> which is not, as ſome would perſuade us, to Caution us againſt the Obſervation of any Day but the <hi>Lord's-Day;</hi> but only that we ſhould not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the aboliſhed Feaſts of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor the abominable Feaſts of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor their ſuperſtitious Obſervation of fortunate and unfortunate Days. St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> upon this Place, hath theſe Words,<note n="*" place="bottom">Non itaque dies obſervemus, &amp; annos &amp; menſes, &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora, ne audiamus ab apoſtolo, timeo vos, ne forte ſine cauſa laboraverim in vobis.

                  </note> Let us not obſerve Years, and Months, and Times, leaſt we hear the Apoſtle telling us, I am afraid of you, leaſt I have ſhewn on you labour in Vain. For the Perſons he blames, are thoſe who ſay, I will not ſet forward on my Journey, becauſe it is the next Day after ſuch a Time, or becauſe the Moon is ſo; or I'll ſet forward that I may have Luck, becauſe ſuch is juſt now the Poſition of the Stars. I will not Traffick this Month, becauſe ſuch a Star preſides, or I will, becauſe it does. I ſhall plant no Vines this Year, becauſe it is Leap-Year, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0324300200:232"/>
in Compariſon of beating an innocent Child that comes between them. But it is more pleaſant, that ſometimes the Childrens Quarrel is revenged by the Dogs; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Times they are ſo ſuperſtitious, as to dare to beat the Dog that comes between them, who turning again upon him that ſmites him, ſends him from ſeeking a vain Remedy, to ſeek a real Phyſician indeed. Hence proceed likewiſe theſe other Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions: For a Man to tread upon his Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold when he paſſes by his own Houſe, to return back to Bed again, if he chance to ſneeze as he is putting on his Shoes; to return into his Houſe, if he ſtumble at his Going out; if the Rats knaw his Cloths, to be more terrified with the Suſpicion of ſome future Evil, then concerned for the preſent Loſs. He ſays, <hi>Cato</hi> gave a wiſe and ſmart Anſwer to ſuch an one, who came in ſome Conſternation to conſult him, about the Rats having knawed his Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; that, ſaid he, is no great Wonder, but it would have been a Wonder indeed, if the Stockings had knawed the Rats. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> mentions this witty Anſwer of a wiſe Heathen, to convince Chriſtians the better of the Unreaſonableneſs and Vanity of all ſuch ſuperſtitious Obſervations. And he concludes, that all ſuch Arts, whether
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0324300200:233"/>
of triffling or more noxious Superſtition, are to be rejected and avoided by Chriſtians, as proceeding originally from ſome pernicious Society between Men and Devils, and being the Compacts and Agreements of ſuch treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous and deceitful Friendſhip. The Apoſtle forbids us to have Fellowſhip with Devils; and that, he ſays, reſpects not only Idols, and Things offered to Idols, but all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Signs pertaining to the Worſhip of Idols, and alſo all Remedies, and other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, which are not appointed publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by GOD to promote the Love of GOD and our Neighbour, but proceed from the private Fancies of Men, and tend to delude the Hearts of Poor deluded Mortals. For theſe Things have no natural Virtue in them, but owe all their Efficacy to a preſumptuous Confederacy with Devils: And they are full of peſtiferous Curioſity, tormenting Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and deadly Slavery. They were firſt taken up, not for any real Power to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them, but gained their Power by Mens obſerving them. And therefore by the Devil's Art they happen differently to different Men, according to their own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and Preſumptions. For the great Deceiver knows, how to procure Things agreeable to every Man's Temper, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare him by his own Suſpicions and Conſent.</q>

               <p>THIS Day goes under ſeveral Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It is called the Day of <hi>CHRIST's Preſentation;</hi> becauſe on it CHRIST was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the Temple; it is called the <hi>Holy-Day</hi> of St. <hi>Simeon;</hi> becauſe it was on it, that he took our SAVIOUR up in his Arms: And it is called the <hi>Purification,</hi> becauſe then the Holy Virgin was purified. It is generally a Day of Feſtivity, and more than ordinary Obſervation among Women, and is therefore called the <hi>Wives Feaſt-Day.</hi> The Feaſting ſeems to be obſerved in Honour of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> for as on the Day of a Woman's being <hi>church'd,</hi> there is no common Entertainment, ſo it ſeems, that this Feaſting was begun in the Times of Popery, by Way of Compliment to the Churching-Day of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>

O LORD JESU, I beſeech thee, that thou wouldſt bleſs this thy Creature of <hi>Wax,</hi> and grant it thy Heavenly Benediction, by the Power of thy Holy Croſs; that as it was a Gift to Man, by which the Darkneſs might be driven away, ſo now it may be endow'd with ſuch Virtue by the <hi>Sign of the</hi> Holy

               <p>Our Author upon this, ſays, That this is manifeſt Blaſphemy and Idolatry.

And ſo among all they had a God that they called <hi>Mars,</hi> that had been tofore a notable Knight in Battayle. And ſo they prayed

to hym for Help, and for that they would ſpeed the better of this Knyght, the People prayed, and did great Worſhip to his Mother, that was called <hi>Februa,</hi> after which Woman, much People have Opinion, that the Moneth <hi>February</hi> is called. Wherefore the 2d Day of thys Moneth is <hi>Candlemaſs Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Romaines this Night, went about the City of Rome, with <hi>Torches and Candles brenning</hi> in Worſhip of this Woman <hi>Februa,</hi> for hope to have the more Helpe and Succoure of her Sonne <hi>Mars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then was there a Pope, that was called Sergius, and when he ſaw Chriſtian People draw to this falſe Maumetry and untrue Belief; he thought to undo this foule Uſe and Cuſtom, and turn it into God's Worſhip, and our <hi>Lady's,</hi> and gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that all Chriſtian People ſhould come to Church, and <hi>offer</hi> up <hi>a Candle brennyng,</hi> in the Worſhip that they did to this Woman Februa, and do Worſhip to <hi>our Lady,</hi> and to her Sonne our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

                  <hi>Valentine-day.</hi> The Names of a ſelect Number of one Sex, are by an equal Number of the other put into ſome Veſſel; and after that, every one draws a Name, which for the preſent is called their <hi>Valentine,</hi> and is alſo look'd upon as a good Omen of their being Man and Wife afterwards.</p>

perhaps the youthful Part of the World hath firſt practiſed this Cuſtom, ſo common at this Seaſon.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Trullan</hi> Council we have Lots and Divinations forbid, as being ſome of thoſe Things which <hi>provoked the LORD to anger</hi> againſt King<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note> The Cuſtom of drawing Lots was after this Manner; on the 23d Day of <hi>June,</hi> which is the Eve of St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Men and Women were accuſtomed to gather together in the Evening by the Sea-ſide, or in ſome certain Houſes, and there adorn a Girl, who was her Parents firſt-begotten Child, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Manner of a Bride. Then they feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and leaped after the Manner of <hi>Bacchanals,</hi> and danced and ſhouted as they were wont to do on their Holy-days: After this they poured into a narrow neck'd Veſſel ſome of the Sea-Water, and put alſo into it certain Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to each of them. Then as if the Devil gifted the Girl, with the Faculty of telling future Things; they would enquire with a loud Voice, about the good or evil Fortune that ſhould attend them: Upon this the Girl would take out of the Veſſel, the firſt Thing that came to Hand, and ſhew it,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0324300200:245"/>
and give it to the Owner; who upon receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, was ſo fooliſh as to imagine himſelf wiſer, as to the good or evil Fortune that ſhould attend him.</p>
               <p>This Cuſtom, as he tells us a little after, is altogether diabolical: And ſurely it was ſo, being uſed as a preſage of what was future. Was the Cuſtom of the Lots now mention'd, uſed as among the Heathens, they would no Doubt be as worthy of Condemnation; but as far as I know, there is but little Credit given to them; tho' that little is too much, and ought to be laid aſide. But if the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom was uſed without any Mixture or Allay of Superſtition, as I believe it is in ſome Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet it is often attended with great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and Misfortunes, with Uneaſineſſes to Families, with Scandal, and ſometimes with Ruin.</p>

               <p>SHROVE-TIDE ſignifieth the Time of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Sins,</hi> as the Word <hi>Tide,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Time;</hi> and the <hi>Saxon</hi> Word <hi>Shrive</hi> or <hi>Shrift,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> plainly ſhew. The Reaſon why this Time is ſo denominated is, becauſe it was ſet apart by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for a Time of <hi>Shriving</hi> or <hi>confeſſing Sins.</hi> For then People were wont to confeſs their Sins, and receive the Sacrament, that they might be better prepar'd for the Religious Obſervation of the following Seaſon of <hi>Lent.</hi> Thus in the Conſtitutions of<note n="*" place="bottom">

This moſt eloquent Man, who was wiſe incomparably beyond the reſt of the Kingdom; ſat about ſix Years, and at laſt was beheaded at <hi>London</hi> by Command of the Rebels, <hi>Tyler</hi> and <hi>Stravo,</hi> A.

                  <hi>Simon Sudbury,</hi> it is ordered, <q>That Lay-Men ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to confeſs in the very Beginning of <hi>Lent.</hi>

is ordered, <q>That on the Week next before <hi>Lent,</hi> every Man ſhould go to his Shrift, and his Shrift ſhould ſhrive him in ſuch a Manner, as his Deeds which he had done requir'd: And that he ſhould charge all that belong to his Diſtrict, that if any of them have Diſcord with any, he make Peace with him; if any one will not be brought to this, then he ſhall not ſhrive him; but then he ſhall inform the Biſhop, that he may convert him to what is right, if he be willing to belong to GOD: Then all Contentions and Diſputes ſhall ceaſe; and if there be any one of them, that hath taken Offence at another, then ſhall they be reconcil'd, that they may more freely ſay in the LORD'S Prayer, <hi>LORD forgive us our Treſpaſſes,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>This Cuſtom of confeſſing to the Prieſt at this Time, was laid aſide by our Church at the Reformation: For Sins are to be confeſs'd to GOD alone, and not to the Prieſt, except when the Conſcience cannot otherwiſe be quieted: Then indeed the Grief is to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Spiritual Guide in private,<note n="*" place="bottom">Exhort. to the Com.</note>

by the Miniſtry of GOD's Word, he may give the Benefit of Abſolution, together with ghoſtly Council and Advice, to the quieting of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the avoiding of all Scruple and Doubtfulneſs.</hi> But how this other worſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom came to be retain'd, of indulging all Manner of Luxury and Intemperance, I know nothing but that the Fleſh was too powerful for the Spirit: The Duties of Religion, how juſtly ſoever enjoyn'd us, are tamely diſpenſed with, but what won't we rather do, than give up the Pleaſures of Life? Surely the Church never deſign'd, when ſhe ſo juſtly took away the publick Confeſſions of this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that Rioting and Gaming, and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhould continue amongſt us. Are theſe a fit Preparation for ſo ſolemn a Seaſon? Will they qualifie us for the Hearing of the Hiſtory of our LORD'S Paſſion? Will they prepare us for the Reception of his Body and Blood? And fit us to meet him in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reſurrection? Will they not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeak us <hi>Heathens</hi> than <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> And lead us to Hell, than on the Way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Such Cuſtoms as theſe may, in ſome Meaſure, be excuſable among them whoſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Seldon. Table Talk.

                        <p>This Cuſtom was retained in many <hi>Schools</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> within this Century; perhaps it is ſtill in Uſe.—The Schoolmaſters were ſaid to preſide at the Battle, and claimed the run-a-way Cocks as their Perquiſites.

                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Spark</hi>'s Feaſts and Faſts.</note> From the Story, as deſcribed by St. <hi>Luke</hi> and St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſome of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church took Occaſion, as on this Day, to go in Proceſſion with <hi>Palms</hi> in their Hands, and to denominate it <hi>Palm-Sunday.</hi>

Thus the <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> in their Tranſlation of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, deſcribe the Ceremony themſelves: <q>Theſe Offices of Honour, done to our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> extraordinarily, were very acceptable. And for a Memory hereof, the Holy Church maketh a ſolemn Proceſſion every Year upon this Day; ſpecially in our Country, when it was Catholick, with the Bleſſed Sacrament reverently carryed, as it were CHRIST upon the <hi>Aſs,</hi> and ſtrawing of Buſhes and Flowers, bearing of Palms, ſetting up Boughs, ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hanging up the richeſt Clothes, the Quire and Quireſters ſinging, as here the Children and the People; all done in a very godly Ceremony, to the Honour of CHRIST, and the Memory of his Triumph upon this Day. The like Service, and the like Duties done to him in all other ſolemn Proceſſions of the Bleſſed Sacrament, and otherwiſe, be undoubtedly no leſs grateful.</q> Dr.<note n="*" place="bottom">Fulk. in Loc.

                  <hi>Fulke</hi> upon this, gives this Anſwer: <q>Your <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> Proceſſion was horrible Idolatry, and abuſing of the LORD'S Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, who ordained his Supper to be eaten
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0324300200:256"/>
and drunken, not to be carryed about in Proceſſion like a Heatheniſh Idol: But it is pretty Sport, that you make the Prieſts that carryeth this Idol, to ſupply the Room of the <hi>Aſs,</hi> on which CHRIST did ride: Thus you turn the Holy Miſtery of CHRIST'S riding to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to a <hi>May-game</hi> and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Play. And yet you ſay, ſuch Service done to CHRIST is undoubtedly exceeding grateful; yea, no leſs grateful, than that was done by his Diſciples, at the Time mentioned in the Text: Your Argument and Proof is none, but your bare Aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. That which the Diſciples did, had the Warrant of the Holy Scripture; but who hath regarded theſe Theatrical Pomps at their Hands? Or what Word of GOD have you to aſſure you that he accepteth ſuch Will-worſhip? Who deteſteth all Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which is according to the Doctrines and Traditions of Men, and not after his own Commandment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From this ſuperſtitious and idolatrous Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, without all doubt it comes to paſs, that we now and then, on a <hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi> ſee the young People carrying <hi>Branches of Palms</hi> in their Hands; which they ſeem fond of having that Day, and which they as little regard at other Times. It is true indeed, it is a Relick of the ancient Superſtition of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but

as it is now intirely ſtript of any Superſtition, and is an Emblem of the Seaſon, and the Tranſactions of that Day; ſo I ſee no harm in ſo innocent an Obſervation.</p>

                  <hi>ſtood ſtill,</hi> but whether the Sun danced upon the very Day our Saviour roſe on, we cannot tell: It's very probable it did not, becauſe the Scriptures are ſilent; and that it never did ſo ſince, I think we may be well aſſur'd; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as never any, that we have heard of, have ſeen any ſuch Thing ſince that Time. If therefore this Tradition hath any Meaning, it muſt be a <hi>metaphorical</hi> one; that when the Morning proves clear, there is a ſeeming Smile over the Face of Nature, and Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhew Tokens of Joy. For as the Earth and her Valleys, by ſtanding thick with Corn,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0324300200:260"/>
are ſaid <hi>to laugh and ſing;</hi> ſo, on Account of the Reſurrection, the Heavens and the Sun may be ſaid to dance for Joy; or as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt words it,<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xcvi. 11. Caeliquidem digni laetentur, terra autem exultet. <hi>Damaſc. in Dominicam Paſcha, P.</hi> 514.</note> The <hi>Heavens may rejoyce, and the Earth may be glad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is then, really ſpeaking, nothing in the Dancing of the Sun upon <hi>Eaſter-day;</hi> but yet it is a very ancient and commendable Cuſtom to be up early at this Holy Time: And therefore <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> in his <hi>Paſchal Hymn,</hi> ſings,<note n="†" place="bottom">Vigilemus mane profundo, &amp; pro unguenti hymnum af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feramus Domino, &amp; Chriſtum videamus juſtitiae ſolem, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus vitam exorientem. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </note> Let us watch very early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and inſtead of Ointment, let us bring an Hymn to our Lord; and let us ſee our CHRIST, the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> who is the Life that riſeth to all Men. And indeed it is the moſt ſeaſonable Time for meditating on our LORD'S Reſurrection, and it's pleaſing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. For as the Place where any nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thing has been tranſacted, ſeldom or never fails to raiſe the Idea of the Tranſaction; ſo the particular Time, when it was done, does generally produce the ſame Effect. And as the Truth of the Former, was the Occaſion of many holy and religious Men going<note n="‡" place="bottom">Fulk. Teſt. Cont. Rhem. Matth. Cap. <hi>28.</hi> in Annot.</note> to viſit
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0324300200:261"/>
the Place of the Sepulchre, and hear it, as it were, ſay, what the Angel did to the Women, <hi>Come, ſee the Place where the Lord lay;</hi> ſo the Truth of the Latter was the Reaſon, why de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and holy Men, did in the beſt Ages of the Church, riſe early in the Morning of the Reſurrection. The Primitive Chriſtians ſpent the Night preceeding it, in Prayers and Praiſes, till the Time of <hi>Cock-crow,</hi> the ſuppoſed Hour of our Saviour's riſing. For as<note n="*" place="bottom">Latinorum concors eſt ſententia, Chriſtum non media nocte, verum mane in aurora, canentibus vice Gallorum an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelis, devicta morte &amp; confractis portis inferi, ſurrexiſſe. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. de Rit. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Durant</hi> tells us, it is univerſally aſſented to by the Latin Church, that after our Saviour had conquer'd Death, and broken the Gates of Hell, he aroſe from the Dead, not at Mid-night, but in the Morning, at the Time of Cock-crow; which not the Cocks, but the Angels themſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed. And when theſe Pernoctations were laid aſide, it was the Cuſtom to riſe early, and ſpend the Morning in ſuch a Manner as was ſuitable to the Nature of the Time. The Salutation of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church <hi>Aneſteſe;</hi> or, <hi>The LORD is riſen,</hi> and the uſual Anſwer, <hi>The LORD is riſen indeed;</hi> were no doubt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salutation of that Morning: And if this preſent Cuſtom of the Vulgar has had at any Time any laudable Cuſtom for its Original, it
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0324300200:262"/>
was, no doubt, this of riſing early to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the more ſeaſonably on the Reſurrection of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>And now, was this the End of riſing early at that Holy Time, it would be very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous; but to riſe with the View of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, is fooliſh and ridiculous. Would we riſe before the Sun, and prevent the Dawn of Day, our Meditations would be ſtrong and vigorous, and almoſt perſuade us that the real Actions of that Morn were preſented to our View. For when at that Time all Things are huſht in Silence, and wrap'd in Darkneſs, or but illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with the friendly Moon, the<note n="*" place="bottom">Devotae Chriſti foeminae, quae illum &amp; vivum dilexerant &amp; mortuum deſiderabant, per noctem ambulantes, juvante luna, venerunt ad monumentum. <hi>Rupert de Divin.

               <p>ON the <hi>Calends,</hi> or the <hi>firſt Day of</hi> May, commonly called <hi>May-Day,</hi> the juvenile Part of both Sexes, were wont to riſe a little after Mid-night, and walk to ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Wood, accompany'd with Muſick and the blowing of Horns; where they break down Branches from the Trees, and adorn them with <hi>Noſe-gays</hi> and <hi>Crowns of Flowers.</hi> When this is done, they return with their Booty home-wards, about the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Sun, and make their Doors and Windows to Triumph in the Flowery Spoil. The after-part of the Day, is chiefly ſpent in dancing round a Tall-Poll, which is called a <hi>May-Poll;</hi> which being placed in a convenient Part of the Village, ſtands there, as it were conſecrated to the <hi>Goddeſs of Flowers,</hi> without the leaſt Violation offer'd it, in the whole Circle of the Year.

Some Foundations of this Kind were as early as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperor. Bede mentions them about 700.</p>
                  <p>Before the Reign of Edward the Confeſſor, the parochial Diviſions in this Kingdom were ſo far advanced, that every Perſon might be traced to the Pariſh to which he belonged.—This appears by the Canons publiſhed in the Time of <hi>Edgar</hi> and <hi>Canute.</hi> The Diſtinction of Pariſhes as they now ſtand, appears to have been ſettled before the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Conqueſt: In Doomſday Book, the Pariſhes agree very near to the modern Diviſion. See Collier's Eccl. Hiſt. Vol. I. p. 231.—Camden tells us, that this Kingdom was firſt divided into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes by Honorius, Archbiſhop of Canterbury, A. D. 636, and counts 2984 Pariſhes.—The Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran Council made ſome ſuch Diviſion as this: It compelled every Man to pay Tythes to his <hi>Pariſh Prieſt;</hi> Men before that Time payed them to whom they pleaſed; ſince then, it has happend

that few, if they could be excuſed from doing it, would care to pay them at all.</p>

               <p>ON the <hi>Eve of St.</hi> John Baptiſt, commonly called <hi>Midſummer Eve,</hi> it is uſual in the moſt of Country Places, and alſo here and there in <hi>Towns and Cities,</hi> for both Old and Young to meet together, and be Merry over a large Fire, which is made in the open Street. Over this they frequently leap and play at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Games, ſuch as Running, Wreſtling, Dancing, &amp;c. But this is generally the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the younger Sort; for the old Ones, for the moſt Part, ſit by as Spectators, and enjoy themſelves and their Bottle. And thus they ſpend the Time till Mid-night, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times till <hi>Cock-Crow.</hi>
               </p>

of the Way of CHRIST. But if this was the Reaſon of this Cuſtom formerly, as it's proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it was, (it having been a common Thing, to ſhadow out Times and Seaſons by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems;) yet the Cuſtom ſtill continued among us, was originally inſtituted upon another Bottom.</p>
               <p>And indeed the<note n="*" place="bottom">Habent hoc a gentibus, antiquitus enim dracones hoc tempore ad libidinem propter calorem excitati, volando per aerem frequenter in puteos &amp; fontes ſpermatizabant, ex quo, &amp;c.

                  </note> Original of this Cuſtom is <hi>Heatheniſh.</hi> For in ancient Times the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, being incited to Luſt through the Heat of the Seaſon, did frequently, as they flew through the Air, Spermatize in the Wells and Fountains. By this Means the Water became infected, and the Air polluted; ſo that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever drank the Waters, was either tormented with a grievous Diſtemper, or loſt his Life. As ſoon as the Phycians perceived this, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ordered Fires to be made every where about the Wells and Fountains, and thoſe Things which occaſioned the noiſomeſt Smell to be burnt, knowing that thereby the Dragons would be driven away. And foraſmuch as this Cuſtom was obſerved about the Time we
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0324300200:291"/>
now celebrate St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Feaſt, it is therefore ſtill obſerved among ſome People. And agreeable to this it is, that Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> tells us, that <hi>Barnwell,</hi> a Village near <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> got its Name from the Children play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about a <hi>Well</hi> on St. <hi>John Baptiſt's Eve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cuſtom of kindling ſuch Fires, was ſeverely cenſur'd by the Church: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trullus,</hi> this Canon was made againſt it,<note n="*" place="bottom">Can. <hi>65.</hi> in Synod. Trull. ex Balſ, P. <hi>440.</hi>
                  </note> That if any Clergy-man or Lay-man obſerved the Rite of making on Fires on the <hi>New-Moon,</hi> (which ſome were wont to obſerve, and according to an old Cuſtom, to leap over them in a mad and fooliſh Manner,) he ſhould be depoſed, if the Former, if the Latter, he ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> upon this <hi>Canon</hi> hath theſe Words: The <hi>New-Moon</hi> was always the firſt Day of the Month, and it was Cuſtomary among the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> to hold then a Feaſt, and pray that they might be lucky du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Continuance of the Month. Of theſe it was, that GOD ſpake by the Prophet: My Soul hateth your <hi>New-Moons</hi> and your Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths. And not only this, but they alſo kindled Fires before their Shops and Houſes, and leaped over them; imagining that all the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0324300200:292"/>
Evils which had befallen them formerly, would be burnt away, and that they ſhould be more ſucceſsful and lucky afterwards. Now about the Sitting of this Synod, there were ſome of the Chriſtians, who obſerved this Cuſtom upon the ſame Accounts that the Heathens did, which occaſioned it's being forbid by the Council; and that if a <hi>Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was Guilty of it, he ſhould be depoſed; if a <hi>Lay-man,</hi> excommunicated. He alſo tells us, that on St. <hi>John Baptiſt's Eve,</hi> the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar were wont to make on Fires for the whole Night, and leap over them, and draw Lots, and Divine about their good or evil Fortune.</p>
               <p>But whatever Reaſon the Heathens had for kindling theſe Fires; whether as <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> thinks, that the luſtful <hi>Dragons</hi> might be driven away, or as the <hi>Canon,</hi> that their evil Fortune might be burnt, it is certain that the Cuſtom was invented and practiſed by them; and becauſe of the Superſtition attending the Obſervation of it, was very juſtly forbidden by the Council. And undoubtedly was the Making of ſuch Fires now, attended with any ſuch Superſtition, it would be equally crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to obſerve them.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi> Of the Feaſt of Sheep-ſhearing, an ancient Cuſtom.</head>
               <p>THE Feaſt of Sheep-ſheering, is generally a Time of Mirth and Joy, and more than ordinary Hoſpitality; indeed it is but little obſerved in theſe Northern Parts, but in the Southern it is pretty common. For on the Day they begin to ſheer their Sheep, they provide a plentiful Dinner for the Sheerers, and for their Friends who come to viſit them on that Occaſion; a Table alſo, if the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther permit, is ſpread in the open Village, for the young People and Children.</p>
               <p>After what Manner ſoever this Cuſtom reach'd us, it is certain it may boaſt of great Antiquity. It is mention'd in the Second Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> as a Feaſt of great Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, both for Grandeur of Entertainment and Greatneſs of Company. No leſs a Perſon than <hi>Abſalom</hi> the King's Son was the Maſter of this Feaſt, and no leſs Perſons were the Gueſts than the King's Sons, the Brethren of <hi>Abſalom;</hi> nay it was a Feaſt that might enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the King himſelf, or ſurely the King would never have been ſo importun'd, never would have receiv'd the Compliment ſo kindly. For 'tis ſaid, <hi>It came to paſs after two full
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0324300200:301"/>
Years, that</hi> Abſalom <hi>had Sheep-ſheerers in</hi> Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazor, <hi>which is beſide</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and</hi> Abſalom <hi>invited all the King's Sons. And</hi> Abſalom <hi>came to the King, and ſaid, Behold, now thy Servant hath Sheep-ſheerers, let the King, I beſeech thee, and his Servants, go with thy Servant. And the King ſaid, Nay, my Son, let us not all go, leſt we be chargeable unto thee.</hi> Of this kind alſo was the Feaſt which <hi>Nabal</hi> made for his Sheerers, when <hi>David was driven</hi> to ſtraits in the Wilderneſs, and ſent his Servants to aſk a Preſent of him. He calls the Day it was held on, a <hi>good Day;</hi> that is, a Day of plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eating and Drinking. And therefore <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> anſwer'd the Servants of <hi>David, ſhall I then take my Bread and my Water, and my fleſh that I have killed for my Sheerers, and give it unto Men, whom I know not whence they be?</hi> And further, it is ſaid in the ſame Chapter, that ſo grand and magnificent was this Feaſt, <hi>that he had a Feaſt in his Houſe, like the Feaſt of a King.</hi> We find alſo in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that <hi>Laban</hi> went to ſheer his Sheep, in which Time <hi>Jacob</hi> made his Eſcape, which <hi>Laban</hi> heard not of till the third Day. Of ſuch great Antiquity then is this Cuſtom, and tho' its Antiquity is not of ſuch force as to palliate Luxury and Profuſeneſs in theſe Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet no doubt it will vindicate the Harmleſneſs of a moderate Feaſt upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> Of <hi>Michaelmaſs:</hi> Guardian Angels the Diſcourſe of Country People at this Time: That it ſeems rather true, that we are protected by a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Angels, than by one particular Genius.</head>
               <p>THE Feaſt of this Seaſon is celebrated in Commemoration of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and all the Orders of Angels. It is called, <hi>The Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of St. Michael,</hi> becauſe of a Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dedicated to him on this Day in Mount <hi>Garganus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this Seaſon of the Year, it is a general Cuſtom to elect the Governors of <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> to promote Peace among Men, and guard them againſt Harm from their malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fellow Creatures. Whether this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Time of the Year has been choſen for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting them, becauſe then is the Feaſt of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the Guardians and Protectors of Men, and of their Communities and<note n="*" place="bottom">Daniel, C. 1.</note> Provinces, is not ſo certain. It is certainer, that when ever it comes, it brings into the Minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that old Opinion of <hi>Tutelar Angels,</hi> that every Man has his <hi>Guardian Angel;</hi> that is, one particular Angel who attends him from his Coming in, till his Going out of Life,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0324300200:307"/>
who guides him through the Troubles of the World, and ſtrives as much as he can, to bring him to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Now that good Angels attend good Men is without Diſpute. They guide them in the Mazes of the Wilderneſs of Life, and bring them to their deſir'd Homes; they ſurround them in the Seas of Afflictions, and lead them to the Shores of Peace; and as when the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> paſſed through the Red-Sea, <hi>the Cloud became Light to them, but Darkneſs to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> ſo in the troubleſome Seas of this Life, the <hi>Angels</hi> are both the Guides of good Men, and their Protectors from Evil, from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels. And therefore the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſays, <hi>The Angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them; and that he will give his Angels Charge over good Men.</hi> They are alſo ſuppoſed to be that Hedge, which GOD placed about <hi>Job,</hi> which the Devil ſo much complains of; and ſure we are, that when the Eyes of <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Servant were open'd, <hi>he ſaw the Mountain full of Chariots and Horſes of Fire round about</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha. That therefore good Men are guarded and protected by Angels the Scripture ſhews very clearly. But that every Man has his particular <hi>Genius,</hi> ſeems to be founded more upon Tradition, than any Certainty from Scripture. Thus the <hi>Egyptians</hi> believed that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0324300200:308"/>
every Man had three Angels attending him; the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> that every Man had two; the <hi>Romans,</hi> that there was a good and an evil <hi>Genius.</hi> And hence it is that the <hi>Roman</hi> Poet ſays, <hi>Quiſque ſuos patitur manes,</hi> every Man hath his evil <hi>Genius.</hi> And if we may believe the Authority of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> the evil <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Brutus</hi> appeared to him the Night before the Battle of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and told him he was his evil Genius, and that he would meet him there.</p>
               <p>But there are greater Authorities than theſe in Vindication of this Opinion: <hi>Caſalion</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, it may be proved from Scripture, and not only from the Tradition of the<note n="*" place="bottom">Unicuique Deus cuſtodem appoſuit; &amp; aſſerimus indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitanter nos ex ſcripturas illam fidem, non gentium nugibus. <hi>Caſſal.</hi> 217. <hi>P. de Vet.

                  </note> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. And of this Opinion was <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Theodoret,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are indeed two Places in the New Teſtament, which have a View to this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The firſt is in the 18th of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> the 10th Verſe, <hi>Take heed that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe little Ones: For I ſay unto you, that their Angels do always behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Now becauſe this Place takes Notice of the Angels of theſe little Ones, ſome have therefore concluded that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0324300200:309"/>
every Man has his good Angel; at leaſt that good Men have. But now this Concluſion does not certainly follow from theſe Words: For when it is ſaid <hi>their Angels,</hi> it does indeed certainly infer, that the Angels do protect good Men, but not that every Man has his particular Angel. And hence therefore, as one obſerves, St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> makes uſe of theſe Words, <hi>Enteuthen, delon,</hi> &amp;c. it is manifeſt that the Saints at leaſt, if not all Men, have their Angels: But he does not hence conclude, that every Man has one. The other Place is in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> where it is ſaid, that when <hi>Peter</hi> was delivered out of Priſon, they would not believe the Maid it was he, but ſaid, <hi>It was his Angel.</hi> It muſt be own'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from this, that it ſeems the Opinion of thoſe in the Houſe, that every Man had his <hi>Guardian Angel;</hi> but this is no Proof of the Thing's being ſo: It only proves, that it was their Opinion, but not that this Opinion is true. The <hi>Jews</hi> had ſuch a <hi>Tradition</hi> among them, and what was here ſpoken, was perhaps only according to that Tradition. Beſides we read on the contrary, that ſometimes one and the ſame Angel has been ſent to different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; thus <hi>Gabriel</hi> was ſent to <hi>Daniel, Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> and the bleſſed Virgin: Sometimes the Scripture tells us of many Angels protecting one Man; for ſo was <hi>Eliſha</hi> protected; and as
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0324300200:310"/>
we wreſtle <hi>not only againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt all the Powers of Darkneſs,</hi> ſo we have many Angels to aſſiſt and defend us. I ſhall not dare to determine poſitively againſt this Opinion, which has travelled down through ſo many Ages, which has been held by ſo many wiſe and learned Men, and which has ſuch Scriptures brought to its Defence; this I ſhall only ſay, that of the two Opinions, the Latter ſeems to be the more probable; that it ſeems more conſonant to Scripture, that we are attended by a Number of Angels, than by a particular <hi>Tutelar Angel.</hi> But this I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not as neceſſary to be believed. For I am perſwaded there is no Fault in believing either the one or the other, as it appears more probable: For whether ſoever we believe, we believe in the Protection of Angels, and that ſeems to be all which the Scripture requires.</p>

               <p>IN the Southern Parts of this Nation, the moſt of Country Villages are wont to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome Sunday in a more particular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than the other common Sundays of the Year, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sunday after the <hi>Day of Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> i. e. the Sunday after the <hi>Day of the Saint,</hi> to whom their Church was dedicated. Then the Inhabitants deck themſelves in their gaudieſt Clothes, and have open Doors and ſplendid Entertainments, for the Reception and Treating of their Relations and Friends, who viſit them on that Occaſion, from each neighbouring Town. The Morning is ſpent for the moſt Part at Church, tho' not as that Morning was wont to be ſpent, not with the Commemoration of the <hi>Saint or Martyr,</hi> nor the grateful Remembrance of the <hi>Builder and Endower.</hi> The remaining Part of the Day, is ſpent in Eating and Drinking; and ſo is alſo a Day or two afterwards, together with all Sorts of Rural Paſtimes and Exerciſes, ſuch as <hi>Dancing on the Green, Wreſtling, Cudgelling,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  </note> on the Sunday after the <hi>Encaenia,</hi> or <hi>Feaſt of the Dedication</hi> of the Church, it was uſual for a great Number of the Inhabitants of the Village, both Grown and Young, to meet together about break of Day, and cry, <hi>Holy-wakes, Holy-wakes,</hi> and after <hi>Mattens</hi> to go to Feaſting and Sporting, which they continu'd for two or three Days.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Northren Parts,</hi> the Sunday's Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is almoſt loſt, and they obſerve only one other Day for the whole, which among them is called the <hi>Hopping;</hi> I ſuppoſe from the dancing and other Exerciſes then uſed.

               <p>This then is the Beginning of our <hi>Country Wakes,</hi> but they continu'd not in their original Purity: For the Feaſting and Sporting got the aſcendant of Religion, and ſo this <hi>Feaſt of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi>

degenerated into Drunkenneſs and Luxury. At preſent there is nothing left but the very Refuſe and Dregs of it; Religion having not the leaſt Share in it, which till theſe latter Ages always had ſome.

               <p>WHEN the Fruits of the Earth are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in, and laid in their proper Receptacles, it is common, in the moſt of Country Places to provide a plentiful Supper for the <hi>Harveſt-Men,</hi> and the Servants of the Family; which is called a <hi>Harveſt-Supper,</hi> and in ſome Places a <hi>Mell-Supper,</hi> a <hi>Churn-Supper,</hi> &amp;c. At this the Servant and his Maſter are alike, and every Thing is done with an equal Freedom. They ſit at the ſame Table, converſe freely together, and ſpend the remaining Part of the Night in dancing, ſinging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without any Difference or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction.</p>

               <p>The antient Egyptians, if the Reſurrection of the Body had been a Tenet of their Faith, would perhaps have thought an <hi>Egg</hi> no improper hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Repreſentation of it.—The Excluſion of a living Creature by Incubation, after the vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple has lain a long while dormant or extinct, is a Proceſs ſo truly marvellous, that if it could be diſbelieved, would be thought by ſome a Thing as incredible, as that the Author of <hi>Life</hi> ſhould be able to re-animate the <hi>Dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conjecture that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> borrowed this Cuſtom from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who in celebrating their Paſſover, ſet on the Table two unleavened Cakes, and two Pieces of the Lamb; to this they added ſome ſmall Fiſhes, becauſe of the Leviathan; <hi>a

               <p>Witchcraft, in <hi>modern</hi> Eſtimation, is a Kind of Sorcery, (eſpecially in Women) in which it is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly ſuppoſed that an <hi>old Woman,</hi> by entering into a Contract with the Devil, is enabled in many Inſtances to change the Courſe of Nature, to raiſe Winds, perform Actions that require more than human Strength; and to afflict thoſe that offend her with the ſharpeſt Pains, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>He tells us alſo, that the laſt Inſtance of theſe frantic Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions for Witchcraft in the North of Scotland, was in June 1727, as that in the South was at Paiſly in 1696, where among others a Woman, young and handſome, ſuffered, and with a reply to her enquiring Friends, worthy a Roman Matron:</p>
                     <p>Being aſked why ſhe did not make a better Defence on her Trial, ſhe anſwered, "My Perſecutors have deſtroyed my Honour, and my Life is not now worth the Pains of defending." He goes on: "The laſt Inſtance of national Credulity on this Head was the Story of the Witches of Thurſo, who tormenting for a long Time an honeſt Fellow under the uſual form of Cats, at laſt provoked him ſo, that one Night he put them to flight with his broad Sword, and cut off the Leg of one leſs nimble than the Reſt: On his taking it up, to his Amazement he found it belonged to a Female of his own Species, and next Morning diſcovered the Owner, an old Hag, with only the companion Leg to this."</p>
                     <p>But theſe Relations of almoſt obſolete Superſtitions muſt never be thought a Reflection on this Country, as long as any Memory remains of the tragical End of the Poor People at <hi>Tring,</hi> who within a few Miles of our Capital itſelf, in 1751, fell a Sacrifice to the Belief of the Common People in Witches, or of that ridiculous Impoſture in the Capital itſelf, in 1762, of the Cocklane Ghoſt, which found credit with all Ranks of People. Note, p. 145.</p>
                     <p>He farther obſerves, that at Edinburgh, there is ſtill ſhewn a deep and wide Hollow beneath Calton Hill, the Place where thoſe imaginary Criminals, Witches and Sorcerers, were burnt in leſs enlightened Times</p>

And People are credulous in that Point, and ready to impute Accidents and natural Operations to Witchcraft—It is worthy the obſerving, that both in antient and late Times (as in the Theſſalian Witches and the Meetings of Witches that have been recorded by ſo many <hi>late</hi> Confeſſions) the great Wonders which they tell, of <hi>carrying</hi> in the <hi>Aire, transforming themſelves</hi> into <hi>other Bodies,</hi> &amp;c. are ſtill reported to be wrought, not by <hi>Incantation</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> but by <hi>Ointments</hi> and <hi>anointing</hi> themſelves <hi>all over</hi> —This may juſtly move a Man to think that theſe Fables are the Effects of <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;</hi> for it is certain that Ointments do all (if they be laid on any Thing thick) by ſtopping of the Pores, ſhut in the Vapours, and ſend them to the Head extremely; and for the particular Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of thoſe magical Ointments, it is like they are opiate and ſoporiferous: For anointing of the Forehead, Neck, Feet, Back-bone, we know is uſed for procuring dead Sleeps.

in whatever Houſe a Cat died, all the Family ſhaved their Eye-brows.

alſo, he obſerves farther, the faint traces of theſe antient Cuſtoms in another ſuperſtitious Method of proving a Witch; it was done by weighing the ſuſpected Party againſt the Church Bible, which if they outweighed, they were innocent; but on the contrary, if the Bible proved the heavieſt, they were inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.—However abſurd and fooliſh theſe ſuperſtitious Cuſtoms may ſeem to the preſent Age, little more, he obſerves, than a Century ago, there were ſeveral unhappy Wretches, not only apprehended, but alſo cruelly burnt alive for Witchcraft, on very little better Evidence than the above ridiculous Trials. Several great and learned Men have alſo taken vaſt Pains to convince the doubting Age of the real Exiſtence of Witches, and the Juſtneſs of their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But ſo very unbelieving we are grown at preſent in theſe and ſuch like Stories, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them only as the idle Phantoms of a fertile Imagination.</q>

               <p>MR. Blount derives this Word from the French <hi>Pleige,</hi> a Surety, or Gage.—To pledge one drinking is generally thought to have had its Origin thus: When the Danes bore ſway in this Land, if a Native drank, they would ſometimes ſtab him with a Dagger or Knife; hereupon Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would not drink in Company,<note n="*" place="bottom">There was an antient Cuſtom called a <hi>Bid-Ale</hi> or <hi>Bidder-Ale,</hi> from the Saxon <hi>Bidden</hi> to pray or ſupplicate, when any honeſt Man decayed in his Eſtate, was ſet up again by the liberal Benevolence and Contributions of Friends at a Feaſt, to which thoſe Friends were bid or invited. It was moſt uſed in the Weſt of England, and in ſome Counties called a <hi>Help Ale.</hi> Such Inſtances of Benevolence are retained in the North.—At the Chriſtening Entertainments of many of the poor People (who are unfortunate enough to provide more <hi>Mouths</hi> than they find <hi>Meat</hi> for) great Collections are made oftentimes by the Gueſts, and ſuch as will far more than defray the Expences of the Feaſt of which they have been partaking.</note> unleſs ſome one preſent would be their <hi>Pledge</hi> or Surety, that they ſhould receive no Hurt, whilſt they were in their Draught.</p>
               <p>Others affirm the true ſenſe of the Word to be this: That if the Perſon drank unto, was not diſpoſed to drink himſelf, he would put another for a Pledge to do it for him, otherwiſe the Party who began, would take it ill.</p>

                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:0324300200:361"/>Mr. Strutt confirms the former Opinion in the following Words: The old Manner of Pledging each other when they drank<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <hi>Bumpers</hi> are of great Antiquity.— Thus Paulus Warnefridus is cited in Du Cange's Gloſſary, telling us, in lib. 5. de geſtis Langobard. Cap. 2. <q>Cumque ii qui diverſi generis potiones ei a Rege deferebant, de verbo Regis eum rogarent, ut <hi>totam fialam</hi> biberent, ille in honorem Regis ſe <hi>totam</hi> bibere promit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, parum aquae libabat de argenteo Calice.</q> Vide Martial. lib. 1.

                     <p>That it is good to be <hi>drunk once a Month,</hi> ſays the Author of the Vulgar Errors, is a common Flattery of Senſuality, ſupporting itſelf upon Phyſic, and the healthful Effects of Inebriation.—It is a ſtriking Inſtance of <q>the doing <hi>ill,</hi> as we ſay, that <hi>good</hi> may come of it.</q>—It <hi>may</hi> happen that Inebriation, by cauſing Vomiting, may cleanſe the Stomack, &amp;c. but it ſeems a very dangerous Kind of Doſe. and of which the <hi>"repetatur hauſius,"</hi> too quickly repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will evince, that Men may pervert that, which Nature intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a <hi>Cordial,</hi> into the moſt baneful of all <hi>Poiſons.</hi> It has been vulgarly called, "giving a Fillip to Nature."</p>
                     <p>Dr. Browne is of Opinion, that the human Faces deſcribed in Ale-Houſe <hi>Signs,</hi> in Coats of Arms, &amp;c. for the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> are Reliques of Paganiſm, and that theſe Viſages originally impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Chequers,</hi> at this Time a common Sign of a Public-Houſe, was originally intended for a Kind of <hi>Draught-Board,</hi> called <hi>Tables,</hi> and ſhewed that there that Game might be played. From their Colour, which was red, and the Similarity to a <hi>Lattice,</hi> it was corruptly called the <hi>Red Lettuce,</hi> which Word is frequently uſed by antient Writers to ſignify an <hi>Ale-Houſe.</hi> Vide Antiq. Repertor. Vol. I. p. 50.</p>
                  </note> was thus: The Perſon who was going to drink, aſked any one of the Company that ſat next him, whether he
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0324300200:362"/>
would pledge him, on which he anſwering that he would, held up his Knife or Sword, to guard him whilſt he drank (for while a Man is drinking he neceſſarily is in an unguarded Poſture, expoſed to the treacherous Stroke of ſome hidden or ſecret Enemy).</p>
               <p>This Cuſtom, as it is ſaid, firſt took riſe from the Death of young King Edward, (called the Martyr) Son to Edgar, who was by the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Elfrida, his Step-Mother, traiterouſly ſtabbed in the Back as he was drinking.</p>
               <p>Mr. Strutt's Authority here is William of Malmſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, and he obſerves from the Delineation he gives, (and it muſt be obſerved that his <hi>Plates,</hi> being <hi>Copies</hi> from antient illuminated <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> are of unqueſtionable Authority) that it ſeems perfectly well to agree with the reported Cuſtom; the middle Figure is addreſſing himſelf to his Companion, who (ſeems to) tell him that he pledges him, holding up his Knife in Token of his readineſs to aſſiſt and protect him.

               <p>The antient Greeks and Romans uſed at their Meals to <hi>make Libations, pour out</hi> and even <hi>drink Wine</hi> in Honour of the Gods.—The claſſical Writings abound with Proofs of this.</p>

               <p>THE very learned Author of the Vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, has left us a great Deal on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.—It is generally believed that the Cuſtom of <hi>Saluting</hi> or <hi>Bleſſing</hi> upon that Motion, derives its Origin from a Diſeaſe, wherein ſuch as <hi>ſneezed</hi> died.—Carolus Sigonius, in his Hiſtory of Italy, mentions a Peſtilence in the Time of Gregory the Great, that proved mortal to ſuch as <hi>ſneezed.</hi>

               <p>The Diſplay of Merchandize, and the Conflux of Cuſtomers, at theſe principal and almoſt only Emporia of domeſtic Commerce, were prodigious: and they were therefore often held on open and extenſive Plains. (Thus at Newcaſtle on our Town Moor, the <hi>Cow-bill</hi>).</p>
               <p>One of the chief of them was that of St. Giles's Hill or Down, near Wincheſter: The Conqueror inſtituted and gave it as a Kind of Revenue to the Biſhop of Wincheſter. It was at firſt for three Days, but afterwards, by Henry III. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to ſixteen Days.—Its Juriſdiction extended ſeven Miles round, and comprehended even South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton, then a Capital and trading Town. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0324300200:380"/>
who ſold Wares at that time within that Circuit, forfeited them to the Biſhop. Officers were placed at a conſiderable Diſtance, at Bridges<note n="*" place="bottom">Thus at preſent at Newcaſtle: At our <hi>Gates</hi> alſo.</note>, and other Avenues of Acceſs to the Fair, to exact Toll of all Merchandize paſſing that Way: In the mean while all <hi>Shops</hi> in the City of Wincheſter were <hi>ſhut.</hi> A Court called the Pavilion compoſed of the Biſhop's Juſticiaries and other Officers had Power to try Cauſes of various Sorts for ſeven Miles round.

                     <p>An Inſtance of great Fortune in one born with this <hi>Coif</hi> is given by Aelius Lampridius, in the Hiſtory of Diadumenos, who came afterwards to the Sovereign Dignity of the Empire.

that was ſometimes found about the Heads of new-born Infants.—It was preſerved with great Care, not only as medical in Diſeaſes, but alſo as contributing to the good Fortune of the Infant and others.—This, ſays Dr Browne, is no more than the Continuation of a Superſtition that is of very remote Antiquity. Thus we read in the Life of Antoninus, by Spartianus, that Children are ſometimes born with this natural <hi>Cap,</hi> which <hi>Midwives</hi> were wont to ſell to credulous Lawyers, who held an Opinion that it contributed to their Promotion<note n="*" place="bottom">"But to ſpeak ſtrictly, continues our Author, the Effect is natural, and thus to be conceived, the Infant hath three Teguments, or membranous Filmes which cover it in the Womb, i. e. the <hi>Corion, Amnios</hi> and <hi>Allantois;</hi> the <hi>Corion</hi> is the outward Membrane, wherein are implanted the Veins, Arteries, and umbilical Veſſels, whereby its Nouriſhment is conveyed: The <hi>Allantois</hi> a thin Coat ſeated under the Corion, wherein are received the watery Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions conveyed by the <hi>Urachus,</hi> that the Acrimony thereof ſhould not offend the Skin.

Now about the Time when the Infant breaketh theſe Coverings, it ſometimes carrieth with it about the Head a <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Amnios,</hi> or neereſt Coat; which ſaith Spiegelius, either proceedeth from the Toughneſs of the Membrane or Weakneſſe of the Infant that <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot get clear thereof,</hi> and therefore herein Significations are natural and concluding upon the Infant, but not to be extended unto magical Signalities or any other Perſon."</note>.</p>

               <p>THIS <hi>Appearance,</hi> called in Latin, <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> has long been an article in the Catalogue of popular Superſtitions. It is ſaid to be chiefly ſeen in Summer Nights, frequenting Meadows, Marſhes, and other moiſt Places.—It has been thought by ſome to ariſe from a viſcous Exhalation, which being kindled in the Air, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects

a Sort of thin Flame in the Dark without any ſenſible Heat. It is often found flying along Rivers and Hedges, becauſe, as it is conjectured, it meets there with a Stream of Air to direct it.</p>
               <p>Philoſophers are much divided in their Solution of this Phenomenon. Sir Iſaac Newton ſays it is a Vapour ſhining without Heat, and that there is the ſame Difference between this Vapour and Flame, as between rotten Wood ſhining without Heat and burning Coals of Fire.</p>
               <p>Others ſuppoſe it to be ſome <hi>nocturnal flying Inſect:</hi> Indeed they have gone ſo many different Ways in purſuit of this Wanderer, that, according to the popular Notion of its conducting into Bogs and other Precipices, ſome of them muſt have been miſled and bewildered by it.—We may follow them however as far as we pleaſe in this Paper Purſuit without any Danger.</p>

               <p>It inclines one to think that the Appearance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſideration is no more than the ſhining of ſome Night-flying Inſect, when we are informed, that they give Proof as it were of Senſe, by avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Objects—that they often go in a Direction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

               </head>
               <p>THE Moon, the antient Object of idolatrous Worſhip, has in later Times compoſed an Article in the Creed of popular Superſtition: The Moon, Dr. Johnſon tells us, has great influence in vulgar Philoſophy. In his Memory, he obſerves, it was a Precept annually given in one of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Almanacks, to kill Hogs when the Moon was increaſing, and the Bacon would prove the better in boiling.</p>
               <p>The common People, Bailey tells us, in ſome Counties in England are accuſtomed at the Prime of the Moon to ſay: "It is a fine Moon, God bleſs her," which ſome imagine to proceed from a blind Zeal, retained from the antient Iriſh, who worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Moon, or from a Cuſtom in Scotland, (particularly in the Highlands) where the Women make a Curteſy to the New Moon: And ſome Engliſh Women ſtill retain a Touch of this Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſm, who getting up upon and ſitting aſtride on a Gate or Stile, the firſt Night of the New Moon ſay:
<q>
                     <l>"All hail to the Moon, all hail to thee,</l>
                     <l>I prithee good Moon declare to me.</l>

                  </q>

               <p>The antient Druids had their ſuperſtitious Rites at the Changes of the Moon.—The <hi>hornedneſs</hi> of the New Moon is ſtill faintly conſidered by the vulgar as an Omen with Regard to the Weather.</p>

               <head>Of <hi>SECOND SIGHT.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE learned Author of the Rambler having favoured the Public with his Thoughts on this ſingular Kind of Superſtition, and having ſo lately viſited the Scene of its declining Influence, it will be unneceſſary to apologize for uſing his own Words on the Subject: "We ſhould have had little claim, ſays he, to the Praiſe of Curioſity, if we had not endeavoured with particular Attention to examine the Queſtion of the <hi>Second Sight.</hi> Of an Opinion received for Centuries by a whole Nation, and ſuppoſed to be confirmed through its whole Deſcent, by a ſeries of ſucceſſive Facts, it is deſirable that the Truth ſhould be eſtabliſhed, or the Fallacy detected.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second Sight</hi> is an Impreſſion made either by the Mind upon the Eye, or by the Eye upon the Mind, by which Things diſtant or future are perceived, and ſeen as if they were preſent. A Man on a Journey far from Home falls from his Horſe, another who is perhaps at work about the Houſe,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0324300200:403"/>
ſees him bleeding upon the Ground, commonly with a Landſcape of the Place where the Accident befalls him. Another Seer driving Home his Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or wandering in Idleneſs, or muſing in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, is ſuddenly ſurprized by the Appearance of a bridal Ceremony, or funeral Proceſſion, and counts the Mourners or Attendants, of whom, if he knows them, he relates the Names, if he knows them not, he can deſcribe the Dreſſes. Things diſtant are ſeen at the Inſtant when they happen. Of Things future I know not that there is any Rule for determining the Time between the Sight and the Event.</p>
               <p>This receptive Faculty, for Power it cannot be called, is neither voluntary nor conſtant. The Appearances have no Dependence upon Choice: they cannot be ſummoned, detained, or recalled. The Impreſſion is ſudden, and the Effect often painful.</p>
               <p>By the term Second Sight, ſeems to be meant a Mode of ſeeing, ſuperadded to that which Nature generally beſtows. In the Earſe it is called Taiſch; which ſignifies likewiſe a Spectre, or a Viſion. I know not, nor is it likely that the Highlanders ever examined, whether by Taiſch, uſed for the Second Sight, they mean the Power of ſeeing, or the Thing ſeen.</p>
               <p>I do not find it to be true, as it is reported, that to the Second Sight nothing is preſented but Phantoms of Evil. Good ſeems to have the ſame Proportion in thoſe viſionary Scenes, as it obtains in real Life: almoſt all remarkable Events have evil for their Baſis; and are either Miſeries incurred,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0324300200:404"/>
or Miſeries eſcaped. Our Senſe is ſo much ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of what we ſuffer, than of what we enjoy, that the Ideas of pain predominate in almoſt every Mind. What is Recollection but a Revival of Vexations, or Hiſtory but a Record of Wars, Treaſons, and Calamities? Death, which is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the greateſt Evil, happens to all. The greateſt good, be it what it will, is the Lot but of a Part.</p>
               <p>That they ſhould often ſee Death is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; becauſe Death is an Event frequent and important. But they ſee likewiſe more pleaſing Incidents. A Gentleman told me, that when he had once gone far from his own Iſland, one of his labouring Servants predicted his Return, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Livery of his Attendant, which he had never worn at Home; and which had been, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous Deſign, occaſionally given him.</p>
               <p>Our Deſire of Information was keen, and our Inquiry frequent. Mr. Boſwell's Frankneſs and Gaiety made every Body communicative; and we heard many Tales of theſe airy Shows, with more or leſs Evidence and Diſtinctneſs.</p>
               <p>It is the common Talk of the Lowland Scots, that the Notion of the Second Sight is wearing away with other Superſtitions; and that its Reality is no longer ſuppoſed, but by the groſſeſt People. How far its Prevalence ever extended, or what Ground it has loſt, I know not. The Iſlanders of all degrees, whether of Rank or Underſtanding, univerſally admit it, except the Miniſters, who univerſally deny it, and are ſuſpected to deny it, in Conſequence of a Syſtem, againſt Conviction.
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0324300200:405"/>
One of them honeſtly told me, that he came to Sky with a Reſolution not to believe it.</p>
               <p>Strong Reaſons for Incredulity will readily occur. This Faculty of ſeeing Things out of ſight is local, and commonly uſeleſs It is a Breach of the common Order of Things, without any viſible Reaſon or perceptible Benefit. It is aſcribed only to a People very little enlightened; and among them, for the moſt Part, to the mean and the ignorant.</p>
               <p>To the Confidence of theſe Objections it may be replied, that by preſuming to determine what is fit, and what is beneficial, they preſuppoſe more Knowledge of the univerſal Syſtem than Man has attained; and therefore depend upon Principles too complicated and extenſive for our Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and that there can be no Security in the Conſequence, when the Premiſes are not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; that the Second Sight is only wonderful becauſe it is rare, for, conſidered in itſelf, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves no more difficulty than dreams, or perhaps than the regular Exerciſes of the cogitative Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that a general Opinion of communicative Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, or viſionary repreſentations, has prevailed in all Ages and all Nations; that particular Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have been given, with ſuch Evidence, as neither Bacon nor Bayle has been able to reſiſt; that ſudden Impreſſions, which the Event has ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, have been felt by more than own or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them; that the Second Sight of the Hebrides implies only the local Frequency of a Power, which is nowhere totally unknown; and that where we are unable to decide by antecedent Reaſon, we muſt be content to yield to the Force of Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:0324300200:406"/>By pretenſion to Second Sight, no profit was ever ſought or gained. It is an involuntary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in which neither Hope nor Fear are known to have any Part. Thoſe who profeſs to feel it, do not boaſt of it as a Privilege, nor are conſidered by others as advantageouſly diſtinguiſhed. They have no temptation to feign; and their hearers have no motive to encourage the Impoſture.</p>
               <p>To talk with any of theſe Seers is not eaſy. There is one in Sky, with whom we would have gladly converſed; but he was very groſs and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and knew no Engliſh. The Proportion in theſe Countries of the Poor to the Rich is ſuch, that if we ſuppoſe the Quality to be accidental, it can very rarely happen to a Man of Education; and yet on ſuch Men it has ſometimes fallen. There is now a Second Sighted Gentleman in the Highlands, who complains of the Terrors to which he is expoſed.</p>
               <p>The foreſight of the Seers is not always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: they are impreſſed with Images, of which the Event only ſhews them the Meaning. They tell what they have ſeen to others, who are at that Time not more knowing than themſelves, but may become at laſt very adequate Witneſſes, by comparing the Narrative with its Verification.</p>
               <p>To collect ſufficient Teſtimonies for the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Publick, or ourſelves, would have required more Time than we could beſtow. There is, againſt it, the ſeeming Analogy of Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly ſeen, and little underſtood; and for it, the indiſtinct Cry of national Perſuaſion, which may be perhaps reſolved at laſt into Prejudice and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. I never could advance my Curioſity to

conviction; but came away at laſt only willing to beleive."</p>

               <p>EVERY Dream, according to Wolfius, takes its Riſe from ſome Senſation, and is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Succeſſion of Phantaſms in the Mind: His Reaſons are, that when we dream, we imagine ſomething, or the Mind produces Phantaſms; but no Phantaſms can ariſe in the Mind without a previous Senſation, hence neither can a Dream ariſe without ſome previous Senſation.</p>
               <p>Lord Bacon obſerves, that the Interpretation of natural Dreams has been much laboured, but mixed with numerous Extravagancies, and adds, that at preſent it ſtands not upon its beſt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

this Day.</q> This <hi>(Old Fools)</hi> ſeems to denote it to be a different Day from the "Feaſt of Fools," which was held on the Firſt of January, of which a particular Deſcription may be found in Du Cange's learned Gloſſary in verbo <hi>Kalendae</hi> (See New Year's Day). All our Antiquaries (that I have had the Opportunity of conſulting) are ſilent concerning the <hi>firſt of April.</hi> It owes its Beginning probably to a <hi>Removal,</hi> which was of frequent Uſe in the crowded Roman Calendar, and of which I have juſt now adduced a ſeemingly appoſite Inſtance. There is nothing hardly (ſays the Author of the Eſſay to retrieve the antient Celtic,) that will bear a clearer Demonſtration, than that the primitive Chriſtians by Way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliating the Pagans to a better Worſhip, humoured their Prejudices by yielding to a Conformity of Names<note n="*" place="bottom">This Writer contends, that the ancient Druidical Religion of Britain and the Gauls, had its <hi>Pope,</hi> its <hi>Cardinals,</hi> its Biſhops, its Deacons, &amp;c.</note>, and even of Cuſtoms, where they did not eſſentially interfere with the Fundamentals of the Goſpel Doctrine. This was done in Order to quiet their Poſſeſſion and to ſecure their Tenure:

                     <hi>Andrew,</hi> (ſays this Writer) ſignifies a head Druid or Divine; Hence it was, that when the Chriſtians, by way of exploding the Druids, turned them into Ridicule, in their Feaſt or Holiday of Fools, one of the Buffoon Perſonages was a <hi>Merry Andrew.</hi>" This Name is uſually, but as erroneouſly, as it ſhould ſeem from this Writer's Explication, derived from the Greek, where it ſignifies <hi>manly</hi> or <hi>courageous.</hi> From the Contrarieties in the Definitions of Etymologiſts, Philology ſeems but too juſtly to bear the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Title of <hi>Eruditio ad libitum!</hi> Science that we <hi>twiſt</hi> and <hi>turn</hi> at Pleaſure.</note>, attended (ſays he) with a Thouſand ridiculous and indecent Ceremonies, Gambols, and Antics, ſuch as ſinging and dancing in the Churches, in lewd Attitudes, to ludicrous Anthems, all alluſively to the exploded Pretenſions of the Druids, whom <hi>theſe Sports were calculated to expoſe to Scorn and Deriſion.</hi> This <hi>Feaſt of Fools,</hi> had, continues he, its deſigned Effect, and contributed perhaps more to the Extermination of thoſe Heathens, than all the collateral Aids of Fire and Sword, neither of which were ſpared in the Perſecution of them.

               <p>To the Note on <hi>Toaſt,</hi> Page 342, add, <q>In the <hi>Tatler,</hi> Vol. 1, No. 24, it is ſaid that the Word, in its preſent Senſe, had its Riſe from an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at the Town of Bath, in the Reign of Charles the IId: It happened that on a public Day a celebrated Beauty of thoſe Times was in the <hi>Croſs Bath,</hi> and one of the crowd of her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers took a Glaſs of the Water in which the Fair One ſtood, and drank her Health to the Company. There was in the Place a gay Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, half fuddled, who offered to jump in, and ſwore, though he liked not the <hi>Liquor,</hi> he
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0324300200:426"/>
would have the <hi>Toaſt:</hi> He was oppoſed in his Reſolution; yet this Whim gave Foundation to the preſent Honour which is done to the Lady we mention in our Liquor, who has ever ſince been called a <hi>Toaſt.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I am not able to controvert this Account, but am by no means ſatisfied with it.—The Wit here is likelier to have been a <hi>Conſequence,</hi> than the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this ſingular Uſe of the Word; it puts one in Mind of the well-known Reply of a Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> in ſome late Jeſt Book, who, on having it obſerved to him, that he had given a certain Lady a long while for his <hi>Toaſt,</hi> anſwered, "Yes, but I have not been able to <hi>toaſt her Brown</hi> yet."</p>
               <p>Archbiſhop Tillotſon tells us, <q>That in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability thoſe common juggling Words of <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> are nothing elſe but a Corruption of <hi>hoc eſt corpus,</hi> by Way of ridiculous Imitation of the Prieſts of the Church of Rome in their Trick of Tranſubſtantiation, &amp;c.</q> Diſcourſe on Tranſub. Ser. 26.</p>
               <p>The ſubſequent Paſſage from <hi>Gay</hi> may be added to the Incantations of ruſtic Maids, relative to their Lovers. P. 344.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>At Eve laſt Midſummer no Sleep I ſought,</l>
                  <l>But to the Field a Bag of Hemp-ſeed brought;</l>
                  <l>I ſcattered round the Seed on every Side,</l>
                  <l>And three Times in a trembling Accent cry'd,</l>
                  <l>This Hemp-ſeed with my Virgin Hand I ſow,</l>
                  <l>Who ſhall my True-love be, the Crop ſhall mow.</l>

               <p>Our rural Virgins in the North, are ſaid to uſe ſome ſingular Rites in faſting what they call St. Agnes' Faſt, for the purpoſe of diſcovering their future Huſbands.</p>

                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:0324300200:427"/>Mr. Strutt, ſpeaking of the <hi>Sports</hi> of <hi>Children</hi> in his Engliſh Aera, tells us, <q>Their Amuſements were much the ſame with thoſe at preſent play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over by the young Lads of this Age, as <hi>trundling Hoops, Blind-man's Buff,</hi> playing with <hi>Tops,</hi> ſhooting with <hi>Bows</hi> at Marks, and ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on Bladders; nay the ſtill younger Sort, playing with <hi>Whirligigs</hi> and <hi>Paper Wind-Mills,</hi> all which are found in an <hi>old Miſſal</hi> in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of John Ives, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr>
                  </q> P. 99</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, if I miſtake not, in Hawkſworth's Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that the <hi>Top</hi> is known among the Indians, ſome of whom pointed to our Sailors, who ſeemed to wonder at ſeeing it amongſt them; that in order to make it ſpin, they ſhould laſh it with a Whip. —<hi>Blindman's Buff</hi> is thus deſcribed by Gay:
<q>
                     <l>As once I play'd at <hi>Blind-man's Buff,</hi> it hapt</l>
                     <l>About my Eyes the <hi>Towel thick</hi> was wrapt,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus alſo another puerile Sport:
<q>
                     <l>As at <hi>Hot Cockles</hi> once I laid me down,</l>
                     <l>And felt the weighty Hand of many a Clown;</l>
                     <l>Buxoma gave a gentle Tap and I</l>

                  <hi>Meritot,</hi> in Chaucer, a Sport uſed by Children, by ſwinging themſelves in Bell-ropes, or ſuch-like, till they are giddy. In Latin it is called <hi>Oſcillum,</hi> and is thus deſcribed by an old Writer: Oſcillum eſt
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0324300200:428"/>
genus ludi, ſcilicet cum ſunis dependitur de trabe, in quo Pueri et Puellae ſedentes impelluntur huc et illuc. Speght's Gloſſ. to Chaucer.</p>
               <p>I find the following elegant Deſcription of <hi>Duck</hi> and <hi>Drake</hi> in an antient Church Writer: — The Antiquity of this puerile Sport will appear by the ſubſequent Extract from Minucius Felix: "Pueros videmus certatim geſtientes, teſtarum in mare jacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationibus ludere. Is luſus eſt <hi>teſtam teretem,</hi> jactatione fluctuum <hi>levigatam,</hi> legere de litore: eam teſtam plano ſitu digitis comprehenſam, inclinem ipſum, atque humilem, quantum poteſt, ſuper undas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotare: ut illud jaculum vel dorſum maris raderet, vel enataret, dum leni impetu labitur; vel, ſummis fluctibus tonſis, emicaret, emergeret, dum aſſiduo ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu ſublevatur. Is ſe in pueris victorem ferebat cujus teſta et procurreret <hi>longius</hi> et <hi>frequentius</hi> exſiliret." P. 6.</p>
               <p>Gay deſcribes another well-known Kind of Sport thus:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Acroſs</hi> the fallen Oak the <hi>Plank</hi> I <hi>laid,</hi>

               <p>The following beautiful Sketches of other puerile Diverſions, are taken from Mr. Grey's Ode on a diſtant Proſpect of Eton College:
