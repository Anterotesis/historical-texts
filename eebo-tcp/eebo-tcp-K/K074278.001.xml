            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Hiſtory of India is laid, with great humility, at the foot
of the throne. As no inconſiderable part of Hindoſtan, is now in a manner
comprehended within the circle of the Britiſh empire, there is a propriety in
addreſſing the hiſtory of that country to the Sovereign.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs of your Majeſty's arms has laid open the Eaſt
to the reſearches of the curious; and your gracious accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this

of greater abilities than the preſent tranſlator poſſeſſes, to
ſtudy the annals of a people, remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their antiquity, civilization,
and the ſingular cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of their religion and manners.</p>
            <p> 
               <pb facs="tcp:0828000201:5"/> In the hiſtory of Hindoſtan, now offered to your

they enjoy under the government of a Prince who delights in augmenting the
ſecurity and felicity of his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>That your Majeſty may long remain a public bleſſing, and

            <p>The intimate connection which the Britiſh nation now have, with
a part of Hindoſtan, renders the knowledge of the country languages of great
importance to the ſervants of the public in that part of the world. The
tranſlator, who had extended his views in the way of his profeſſion,
thought it ſo capital a point for him, that he perſevered for ſome years,
in that dry and difficult ſtudy, and incurred a very conſiderable expence,
in retaining maſters, and in procuring manuſcripts.</p>
            <p>Though to qualify himſelf for action, and negotiation in India,
was the primary object of the tranſlator, yet in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as he advanced
in his ſtudies, other motives for his continuing them aroſe. He found, that
however different the manner of the eaſtern writers may be from the correct 
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0828000201:11"/> taſte of Europe, there are many things in their works
worthy of the attention of literary men. Their poetry it is true is too turgid
and florid, and the diction of their hiſtorians too diffuſe and verboſe.
Yet in the firſt we meet with ſome paſſages truly elegant and
ſublime; and amidſt the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of the latter, there appears
ſometimes a nervouſneſs of expreſſion, and a manlineſs of
ſentiment, which might do honour to any hiſtorical genius in the
weſt.</p>
            <p>Locked up in the difficulties of the Perſian tongue, the
literature of Aſia has been hitherto little known in Europe. From an
ignorance ſo unpardonable in this inveſtigating age, a very unfavourable
idea has prevailed concerning the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as hiſtory, of the
eaſtern nations. Full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices ſo natural to an European, the
tranſlator entered upon the ſtudy of the oriental languages. Whatever aid a
knowledge of them might give to his private views, he little hoped to be able
to convert his ſtudies to the amuſement or inſtruction of the public. To
tranſlate ſome piece of hiſtory, was, by his teachers, recommended to him
as a proper exerciſe in the Perſian. The works of Mahummud Caſim
Feriſhta of Delhi, who flouriſhed in the reign of Jehangire, about the
beginning of the ſeventeenth century, was put into his hands for that
purpoſe. As he advanced, a greater field gradually opened before him. He
found, with ſome degree of aſtoniſhment, the minute and authentic
hiſtory of a great empire, the name of which had ſcarcely ever travelled to
Europe.</p>
            <p>To open a door to the literary treaſures, which lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
in the obſcurity of the Perſian, the tranſlator reſolved to proceed in
his verſion of Feriſhta's hiſtory, and to give it <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0828000201:12"/>
to the public as a ſmall ſpecimen of what men of greater abilities may
hereafter meet with in that language. But before he had fully accompliſhed
this deſign, injuries in rank, and other motives, forced him to quit the
company's ſervice, and to return to England. Being, at his departure from
India, poſſeſſed only of one volume of the original, he has been
obliged to confine himſelf to it; and to leave the ſecond volume, which
contains the particular hiſtories of the Decan, Bengal, Guzerat, and
Caſhmire, to a more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opportunity, or to the employment of ſome
other hand. This circumſtance has occaſioned ſome chaſms in that part
of the hiſtory which is now given to the public; and many material
tranſactions of thoſe nations, of whom Feriſhta in his ſecond volume
treats, are only ſlightly mentioned.</p>
            <p>The reigns of the Mogul Emperors, from Akbar, with whom our author
concludes his general hiſtory, have been written by different hiſtorians.
But ſo voluminous are thoſe works, that to attempt a tranſlation, would
be a laborious and very tedious taſk. Since the days of Feriſhta, no writer
that has come to our knowledge, has abridged the hiſtory of India, and
therefore the tranſlator had formed a deſign to compile from various
authors that very eſſential part of the hiſtory of the Mogul empire,
which is not comprehended in the following tranſlation.</p>
            <p>With a view to accompliſh this undertaking, the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
who had been honoured with the particular friendſhip of the preſent Mogul,
applied in perſon to that Prince, for ſuch books, and authentic records, as
were neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Hiſtory of Hindoſtan. The King approved
very <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0828000201:13"/> much of his deſign, and gave orders to his
ſecretary to grant his requeſt. But in the mean time the tranſlator
quitted the ſervice, and retired to Calcutta. To revive however his
Majeſty's memory upon that ſubject, he wrote to him; and as the manner of
writing to eaſtern Princes may afford mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſome curioſity to the
public, we ſhall here give a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tranſlation of the letter.</p>

bounty, having, from their ſplendid preſence, obtained leave of departure,
hath now reached the city of Calcutta, where, retired from the noiſe of
public affairs, he prays for their Majeſty's wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p> 
               <p>Moved by a grateful remembrance of their royal favour, warmed by
the fame, juſtice, and glorious exploits and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of the emperors of
the paradiſiacal regions of Hindoſtan; but more particularly excited by the
renown of the imperial houſe of Timur<note n="‡" place="bottom">Timur,
who in Europe is, by corruption, called Tamerlane, has always conferred upon
him the title of Saib Kirren, or lord of the periods. Kirren, of which Kiran is

<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0828000201:14"/> the curioſity of diſtant nations, with the great
actions of a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did dynaſty of Kings, he has dared to aſpire to
tranſlate the hiſtory of Hindoſtan, from the beſt and moſt authentic
Perſian authors, into the Engliſh language, now ſtrong, learned and
univerſal.</p> 
               <p>From the firſt riſing of the ſtar of the faith, upon theſe
paradiſiacal plains, unto the end of the glorious reign of ARSH ASTANI
MAHUMMUD AKBAR, King, the hiſtory of Empire has been already penned: but,
from that period to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, materials have been wanting to their

Majeſty will ſignify their royal pleaſure to the RAI RAIAN, chief
ſecretary of the illuſtrious preſence, to ſupply their ſervant with
ſuch books and authentic records, as are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to accompliſh his
great deſign. Thus ſhall the glory of their renown ſhine forth to
European eyes, with that ſplendor, which, from the firmament of empire, hath
hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto enlightened the Eaſt.</p> 
            </q>
            <p>The government of the preſidency of Bengal, have of late, in
ſome particulars, imbibed the political principles of the Eaſt; for all
private correſpondence with any of the country powers is ſtrictly
prohibited. The above letter was diſpatched by the tranſlator to a friend
at Allahabad, the preſent reſidence of the Emperor, with a requeſt to
deliver it in perſon to that prince. But whether afraid of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
or guilty of an unaccountable neglect, that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman returned to Calcutta
without preſenting the letter to the Mogul. The tranſlator forwarded it a
ſecond time to Allahabad, but before an anſwer could be received from ſo 
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0828000201:15"/> great a diſtance, he was obliged, after having waited
for the laſt ſhip in the ſeaſon, to embark for Europe.</p>
            <p>Though our author Mahummud Caſim Feriſhta has given the title
of the Hiſtory of Hindoſtan to his work, yet it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that of the
Mahommedan empire in India, than a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral account of the affairs of the
Hindoos. What he ſays concerning India, prior to the firſt invaſion of
the Afgan Muſſulmen, is very far from being ſatisfactory. He collected
his accounts from Perſian authors, being altogether unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the
Shanſcrita or learned language of the Brahmins, in which the internal
hiſtory of India is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. We muſt not therefore, with Feriſhta,
conſider the Hindoos as deſtitute of genuine domeſtic annals, or that
thoſe voluminous records they poſſeſs are mere legends framed by the
Brahmins.</p>
            <p>The prejudices of the Mahommedans againſt the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the
Brahmin religion, ſeldom permits them to ſpeak with common candour of the
Hindoos. It ſwayed very much with Feriſhta when he affirmed, that there is
no hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory among the Hindoos of better authority than the Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barit. That
work is a poem and not a hiſtory: It was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into Perſian by the
brother of the great Abul Fazil, rather as a performance of fancy, than as an
authentic account of the ancient dynaſties of the Kings of India. But that
there are many hundred volumes in proſe in the Shan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrita language, which
treat of the ancient Indians, the tranſlator can, from his own knowledge,
aver, and he has great reaſon to believe, that the Hindoos carry their
authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic hiſtory farther back into antiquity, than any other nation now
exiſting.</p>
            <p> 
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0828000201:16"/> The Mahommedans know nothing of the Hindoo
learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and had they even any knowledge of the hiſtory of the followers of
Brimha, their prejudices in favour of the jewiſh fictions contained in the
Koran, would make them reject accounts, which tend to ſubvert the ſyſtem
of their own faith. The Shanſcrita records contain accounts of the affairs of
the weſtern Aſia, very different from what any tribe of the Arabians have
tranſmitted to poſterity: and it is more than probable, that upon
examination, the former will appear to bear the marks of more authenticity, and
of greater antiquity than the latter.</p>
            <p>But whether the Hindoos poſſeſs any true hiſtory of
greater antiquity than other nations, muſt altogether reſt upon the
authority of the Brahmins, till we ſhall become better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their
records. Their pretenſions however are very high, and they confidently
affirm, that the Jewiſh and Mahommedan religions are hereſies, from what is
contained in the Bedas. They give a very particular account of the origin of
the Jewiſh religion in records of undoubted anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Raja Tura, ſay
they, who is placed in the firſt ages of the Cal Jug, had a ſon who
apoſtatized from the Hindoo faith, for which he was baniſhed by his father
to the Weſt. The apoſtate fixed his reſidence in a country called Mohgod,
and propagated the Jewiſh religion, which the impoſtor Mahommed further
corrupted. The Cal Jug commenced about 4885 years ago, and whether the whole
ſtory may not relate to Terah and his ſon Abraham, is a point which we will
leave to others to determine.</p>
            <p>There is one circumſtance which goes far to prove that there is
ſome connection between the Brahmin Bedas and the <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0828000201:17"/>
doctrines contained in the Old Teſtament. Ever ſince the promulgation of
the religion of Mahommed, which is founded upon Moſes and the Prophets, the
Brahmins have totally rejected their fourth Beda called the Obatar Bah, as the
ſchiſm of Mahommed, according to them, has been founded upon that book.
However extraordinary this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is for rejecting the fourth part of their
religious records, it can ſcarcely be doubted, as it is in the mouth of every
Brahmin.</p>
            <p>Feizi, the brother of Abul Fazil the hiſtorian, was the only
Muſſulman we ever heard of, who underſtood the Shanſcrita. The
fraudulent means by which he acquired it, will be ſhewn in another place. He
never tranſlated any of the Indian hiſtories, excepting the Mahabarit,
which, at beſt, is but an hiſtorical poem, in which a great deal of fable
is blended with a little truth. We, upon the whole, cannot much depend upon the
accounts which the followers of Mahommed give of the religion and ancient
hiſtory of the Hindoos: Their prejudice makes them miſrepreſent the
former, and their ignorance in the Shanſcrita language, has totally excluded
them from any knowledge of the latter.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory of Caſim Feriſhta being an abridgment of a
variety of authors, who wrote diſtinct accounts of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reigns of
the Mahommedan Emperors of Hindoſtan, he, with a view to comprehend in a
ſmall compaſs, every mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial tranſaction, has crowded the events too
much together, without interſperſing them with thoſe reflections which
give ſpirit and elegance to works of this kind: This defect ſeems however
to have proceeded more from a ſtudied brevity, than <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0828000201:18"/> from
a narrowneſs of genius in Feriſhta. Upon ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, eſpecially
in the characters of the princes, he ſhews a ſtrength of judgment, and a
nervouſneſs and conciſeneſs of expreſſion which would do no
diſhonour to the beſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the weſt. What is really remarkable in
this writer is, that he ſeems as much diveſted of religious prejudices, as
he is of political flattery or fear. He never paſſes a good action without
conferring upon it its due reward of praiſe, nor a bad one, let the
villainous actor be never ſo high, without ſtigmatizing it with infamy. In
ſhort, if he does not arrive at the character of a good writer, he certainly
deſerves that of a good man.</p>
            <p>The brevity which we cenſure in Feriſhta, is by no means a
common fault in the writers of Aſia. Redundant and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſe in their
diction, they often regard more the cadence and turn of their ſentences, than
the propriety and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of their thoughts; leading frequently the reader
into a labyrinth to which he can find no end. This is too much the manner of
the learned Abul Fazil himſelf. He wrote the hiſtory of the reign of Akbar
in two large volumes in folio. The intrigues of the court, and all the ſecret
motives to action are inveſtigated with the utmoſt exactneſs; but the
diction is too diffuſe, and the language too florid for the correct taſte
of Europe.</p>
            <p>It ought here to be remarked, that all the oriental hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
write, in what they call in Europe, poetical proſe. This falſe taſte only
commenced about five centuries ago, when literature declined in Aſia, with
the power of the Caliphs. The tranſlator has now in his poſſeſſion,
books written in the Perſian before that period, the diction of 
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0828000201:19"/> which, is as conciſe and manly, as that which deſcended
from Greece and Rome, to the writers of modern Europe. The learned and
celebrated Abul Fazil, inſtead of correcting this vicious taſte, encouraged
it greatly by his florid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in his hiſtory of the reign of Akbar. But
this great writer has, notwithſtanding his circumlocutions, cloathed his
expreſſions with ſuch beauty and pomp of eloquence, that he ſeems to
come down upon the aſtoniſhed reader, like the Ganges in the rainy
ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>The ſmall progreſs which correctneſs and elegance of
ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent and diction has made in the Eaſt, did not proceed from a want of
encouragement to literature. We ſhall find in the courſe of this hiſtory,
that no princes in the world patroniſed men of letters with more generoſity
and reſpect, than the Mahommedan Emperors of Hindoſtan. A literary genius
was not only the certain means to acquire a degree of wealth which muſt
aſtoniſh Europeans, but an infallible road for riſing to the firſt
offices of the ſtate. The character of the learned, was at the ſame time
ſo ſacred, that tyrants, who made a paſtime of embruing their hands in
the blood of their other ſubjects, not only abſtained from offering
violence to men of genius, but ſtood in fear of their pens. It is a proverb
in the Eaſt, that the Monarchs of Aſia were more afraid of the pen of Abul
Fazil, than they were of the ſword of Akbar; and, however amazing it may
ſeem in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute governments, it is certain that the hiſtorians of that
diviſion of the world, have wrote with more freedom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning perſons and
things, than writers have ever dared to do in the Weſt.</p>
            <p> 
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0828000201:20"/> The tranſlator, however, being
ſenſible of the impropriety of poetical diction, in the grave narration of
hiſtorical facts, has, in many places, clipped the wings of Feriſhta's
turgid expreſſions, and reduced his metaphors into common language, without
however ſwerving in the leaſt from the original meaning of the author.</p>
            <p>A frequent repetition of proper names is unavoidable in a work of
ſuch brevity, and ſo much crouded with action. This will perhaps appear the
moſt glaring defect in the work: but to uſe the pronouns too often, would
have rendered the ſenſe more perplexed, and the narration leſs elegant
and diſtinct. The tranſlator, in ſhort, choſe to give the faults of his
author to the public as they ſtood, rather than by an attempt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them,
to ſubſtitute perhaps ſome of his own in their place.</p>
            <p>Our author with great propriety begins the hiſtory of the Patan
empire in Hindoſtan, from the commencement of the kingdom of Ghizni. The
Mahommedan govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which afterwards extended itſelf to Hindoſtan,
roſe originally from very ſmall beginnings among the mountains which divide
Perſia from India. The Afgans or Patans, a warlike race of men, who had been
ſubjects of the vaſt empire of Bochara, revolted under their governor
Abiſtagi, in the fourth century of the Higera, and laid the foundation of the
empire of Ghizni, known commonly in Europe, by the name of Gazna. Under a
ſucceſſion of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like princes, this empire roſe to a ſurpriſing
magnitude. We find that in the reign of Muſaood, in the beginning of the
fifth century of the Higera, it extended from Iſpahan to Bengal, and from the
mouths of the Indus to the banks <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0828000201:21"/> of the Jaxartes, which
comprehends near half of the great continent of Aſia.</p>
            <p>Soon after the death of Muſaood, the Charizmian empire aroſe
on the confines of Perſia and great Tartary. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended itſelf over
Tartary and the greateſt part of the Perſian provinces; the Kings of the
Ghiznian Patans were obliged to relinquiſh their dominions in the north, and
to transfer the ſeat of their empire to Lahore, and afterwards to Delhi.</p>
            <p>When the great conqueror of Aſia Zingis Chan, invaded and
ſubverted the Charizmian empire under Mahummud Shaw, the Patan dominions were
entirely confined within the limits of Hindoſtan. They poſſeſſed
however power ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to repel the generals of that great man, though
fluſhed with victory and the ſpoils of the Eaſt. The whole force of
Zingis, it is true, was never bent againſt Hindoſtan, otherwiſe it is
probable it would have ſhared the fate of the weſtern Aſia, which was
almoſt depopulated by his ſword.</p>
            <p>The uncommon ſtrength of the Patan empire in Hindoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan at
this period, may be eaſily accounted for: It was the policy of the adopted
Turkiſh ſlaves of the family of Ghor, who then held the kingdom of Delhi,
to keep ſtanding armies of the mountain Afgans, under their reſpective
chiefs, who were invariably created Omrahs of the empire. This hardy race,
whatever domeſtic confuſions and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions they might occaſion in
India, were, to uſe Feriſhta's words, a wall of iron againſt foreign
enemies.</p>
            <p> 
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0828000201:22"/> Our author has not been careful to mark
the extent of the Empire in every reign. We can only form a general idea of it,
from the tranſactions which he records. The Empire we find ſometimes
reduced to a few diſtricts round the capital, and at other times, extending
itſelf from the bay of Bengal to Perſia, and from the Carnatic to the great
mountains of Sewalic. In ſhort, the boundaries of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan imperial
dominions, varied in proportion to the abilities of thoſe princes who
poſſeſſed the throne. When the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs diſcovered great parts, the
governors of provinces ſhrunk back from their independance into their former
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but when a weak Prince ſat on the Muſnud, his
lieutenants ſtarted up into Kings around him.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory now given to the public, preſents us with a
ſtriking picture of the deplorable condition of a people ſubjected to
arbitrary ſway; and of the inſtability of empire itſelf, when it is
founded neither upon laws, nor upon the opinions and attachments of mankind.
Hindoſtan, in every age, was an ample field for private ambition, and for
public tyranny. At one time we ſee a petty Omrah ſtarting forth, and wading
through an ocean of blood to the crown, or involving many thouſands of
indigent adventurers in the ruin which he draws upon his own head. At another
time we meet with Kings, from a luſt of power which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats itſelf,
deſtroying thoſe ſubjects over whom they only wiſhed to tyrannize.</p>
            <p>In a government like that of India, public ſpirit is never
ſeen, and loyalty is a thing unknown. The people permit themſelves to be
transferred from one tyrant to another, without murmuring; and individuals look
with unconcern <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0828000201:23"/> upon the miſeries of others, if they are
capable to ſcreen themſelves from the general misfortune. This, however, is
a picture of Hindoſtan in bad times, and under the worſt Kings. As
arbitrary government can inflict the moſt ſudden miſeries, ſo, when in
the hands of good men, it can admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the moſt expeditious relief to
the ſubject. We accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly find in this hiſtory, that the misfortunes of
half an age of tyranny, are removed in a few years, under the mild
adminiſtration of a virtuous prince.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper in this place, to lay before the public, a
ſhort ſketch of the conſtitution of Hindoſtan. The Emperor is
abſolute and ſole arbiter in every thing, and is controlled by no law. The
lives and properties of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Omrahs are as much at his diſpoſal,
as thoſe of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſubjects. The former however are often too
powerful to be puniſhed, while the latter are not only ſlaves to the King,
but to the provincial governors. Theſe governors, diſtinguiſhed by the
name of Nabobs, have in their reſpective juriſdictions, the power of life
and death, and are, in every particular, inveſted with regal authority.</p>
            <p>All the lands in India are conſidered as the property of the
King, except ſome hereditary diſtricts poſſeſſed by Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doo
Princes, for which, when the Empire was in its vigour, they paid annual
tributes, but retained an abſolute juriſdiction in their own hands. The
King is the general heir of all his ſubjects; but when there are children to
inherit, they are ſeldom deprived of their father's eſtate, without the
fortune is enormous, and has been amaſſed in the oppreſſive govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a province. In a caſe of this kind, the children, or neareſt relations,
are allowed a certain proportion for their <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0828000201:24"/>
ſubſiſtance, at the diſcretion of the Caſy or judge. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of
merchants, tradeſmen, and mechanics, are never confiſcated by the crown, if
any children or relations remain.</p>
            <p>The King has the extraordinary power of nominating his
ſucceſſor by will. This part of royal prerogative is not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the
monarchs of Hindoſtan. We find that our own nation, ſo remarkable for their
political freedom, were, not above two centuries ago, made over like a private
eſtate, and that with their own conſent, by the will of a Prince, who
neither deſerved to be beloved nor admired. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the opinion of the
Indians, the right of ſucceſſion is veſted in the male heir, but the
laſt will of the King very often ſuperſedes this idea of juſtice.
Notwithſtanding this prejudice in favour of the firſt born, there is no
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction made between natural children and thoſe born in lawful
wedlock; for every child brought forth in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, whether by wives or
concubines, are equally legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
            <p>The vizier is generally firſt miniſter of ſtate. All edicts
and public deeds muſt paſs under his ſeal, after the royal ſignet is
affixed to them. The Vizier's office conſiſts of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious departments, in
every one of which all commiſſions, patents for honorary titles, and grants
for Jagiers, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully regiſtered. He ſuperintends the royal
exchequer, and, in that capacity, keeps accounts with the Dewans of the
ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral provinces, in every thing which regards the finances.</p>
            <p>A Vakiel Mutuluck is ſometimes appointed by the King. The power
of this officer is ſuperior to that of the Vizier, for he not only has the
ſuperintendency of civil, but alſo of <pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0828000201:25"/> all military
affairs. This laſt is never any part of the Vizier's office; the Amir ul
Omrah, or Buxſhi, being independent captain-general, and paymaſter of the
forces. It is not eaſy to explain to Europeans the full extent of authority
conferred upon the Vakiel Mutuluck; he ſeems to be an officer to whom the
King for a time delegates his whole power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving only for himſelf the
imperial title, and enſigns of royalty.</p>
            <p>The Emperor of Hindoſtan gives public audience twice a day from
the throne. All petitioners, without diſtinction, are, after having gone
through the uſual ceremonies, admitted. They are permitted to preſent their
written complaints to the Ariz Beg, or lord of the requeſts, who attends, in
order to preſent them to the King. The King reads them all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and
ſuperſcribes his pleaſure in a few words, with his own hand. Should any
thing in the petition appear doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it is immediately referred to the
Sidder ul Suddur, whoſe office anſwers to that of our chief juſtice, to
be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and determined according to law.</p>
            <p>The Mahommedans of Hindoſtan have no written laws, but thoſe
contained in the Koran. There are certain uſages founded upon reaſon, and
immemorial cuſtom, which are alſo committed to writing. By the latter
ſome cauſes are determined, and there are officers appointed by the crown,
under the name of Canongoes, who, for a certain fee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the written
uſages to the people. In every diſtrict or pergunnah, there is a cutchery,
or court of juſtice eſtabliſhed. Theſe courts are extremely venal, and
even the legal fees for determining a cauſe concerning property, is one
fourth of <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0828000201:26"/> the value of the matter in diſpute. Their
deciſions were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, very expeditious; and through fear of the
diſpleaſure of the King, who invariably puniſhed with the utmoſt
ſeverity corrupt judges, the Caſys were pretty equitable in their
deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</p>
            <p>In the declining ſtate of the Empire, the provinces were
ſubmitted to the management of Nabobs, or military gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, who farmed the
revenues at a certain ſum, and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the overplus for their own uſe.
Originally the Nabobs were only commanders of the forces, who receiving their
orders from court, through the medium of the Dewan, a civil officer who
collected all the revenues for the King, paid the juſt expences of the
government of the province, and remitted the ſurplus to the exchequer. But
the Nabobs having the military power in their hands, deſpiſed the
autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Dewans, and purpoſely fomented diviſions, factions, and
inſurrections, that they might be indulged with great ſtanding armies, to
make more money paſs through their own hands, and to favour their ſchemes
of independence.</p>
            <p>The imbecility of the Empire daily increaſing, the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
authority veſted in the Dewan, was not ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the real
force in the hands of the Nabob. Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual altercations ſubſiſted
between theſe officers in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and frequent complaints were
tranſmitted to court. Miniſters who preferred preſent eaſe to the
future intereſt of the empire, curtailed the power of the Dewan, and, from
being in a manner the commander in chief of the province, he fell into the
ſimple ſuperintendency of the collections. <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0828000201:27"/> He had,
it is true, the power to prevent new impoſts, and innovations in the law.</p>
            <p>When the King took the field, the provincial Nabobs, with their
troops, were obliged to repair to the imperial ſtandard. Each Nabob erected
his own ſtandard, and formed a ſeparate camp, ſubject only to his own
orders. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bobs every morning attended at the royal pavilion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
their orders from the Amir ul Omrah<note n="*" place="bottom">The
captain-general.</note>, who received his immediately from the King himſelf.
If we except the army of the great Sultan Baber, there are few traces of real
diſcipline to be met with among thoſe myriads, with whom the Emperors of
Hindoſtan often took the field. The forces of Baber were formed on a very
regular and maſterly plan. The diſpoſitions of his battles were
excellent; and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing victories he obtained with a handful of men,
over immenſe armies, are ſufficient to convince us, that military
diſcipline has not always been unknown in Aſia.</p>
            <p>It may to an European, furniſh matter of ſome ſurprize, how
Eaſtern armies of two or three hundred thouſand horſe, and triple that
number of ſoldiers and followers, could be ſupplied with proviſions and
forage upon their march, and in their ſtanding camps. To account for this it
is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that every provincial Nabob, upon his taking the field,
appoints an officer called the Cutwal, whoſe buſineſs it is to
ſuperintend the Bazars or markets, which may belong to his camp. Every
commander of a body of troops obtains at the ſame time, permiſſion to
hoiſt a ſlag for a Bazar, and to appoint a Cutwal of his own, under the
direction of the <pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0828000201:28"/> Cutwal-general. Theſe Cutwals grant
licences to chapmen, ſutlers, and corn dealers, who gladly pay a certain tax
for permiſſion to diſpoſe of their various commodities, under the
protection of the different flags.</p>
            <p>The ſutlers and dealers in corn, being provided with a
ſufficient number of camels and oxen, collect proviſions from all the
countries in their rear, and ſupply the wants of the camp. The pay of
ſoldiers in Hindoſtan is very great, being from 60 to 200 rupees per month,
to every ſingle trooper. This enables them to give ſuch high prices for
proviſions, that the countries round run all hazards for ſuch a great
proſpect of gain. The fertility of Hindoſtan itſelf, is the great
ſource of this ready and plentiful ſupply to the armies; for that country
produces, in moſt parts two, and ſometimes three crops of corn every
year<note n="†" place="bottom">The Indians ſometimes feed their horſes
with a kind of vetch called Gram, which they boil. In want of that, they make a
ſhift with the roots of graſs, which they dig up and waſh in water. This
they reckon better than hay. They are by this means never in want for forage,
in a country ſo remarkable for vegetation. The horſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways belong to the
riders, which renders them more aſſiduous to keep them in proper order, as
their pay depends entirely on the goodneſs of their horſes. But this is
attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a bad conſequence. A ſoldier of fortune, who has nothing but
his horſe to depend upon, is often afraid to expoſe him, where he would
perhaps riſque his own life.</note>.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be expected, that ſomething concerning the
language of the tranſlation, ſhould be ſaid in this place. Employed from
his youth in a profeſſion very different from that of letters, the
tranſlator aſpires not to the character of a fine writer. To expreſs his
author's meaning in a plain and unaffected diction, was all his deſign; and
he expects the public will the more readily overlook any errors he may have
committed, that he neither hopes for much literary reputation, nor wiſhes for
any advantage from his work.</p>

            <head>A DISSERTATION CONCERNING THE Cuſtoms, Manners, Language,
Religion and Philoſophy of the HINDOOS.</head>
            <p>THE learned of modern Europe have, with reaſon, complained that
the writers of Greece and Rome did not extend their enquiries to the religion
and philoſophy of the Druids. Poſterity will perhaps, in the ſame manner,
find fault with the Britiſh for not inveſtigating the learning and
religious opinions, which prevail in thoſe countries in Aſia, into which
either their commerce or their arms have penetrated. The Brahmins of the Eaſt
poſſeſſed in antient times, ſome reputation for knowledge, but we
have never had the curioſity to examine whether there was any truth in the
reports of antiquity upon that head.</p>
            <p>Excuſes, however, may be formed for our ignorance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the learning, religion and philoſophy of the Brahmins. Literary inquiries are
by no means a capital <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:0828000201:30"/> object to many of our adventurers
in Aſia. The few who have a turn for reſearches of that kind, are
diſcouraged by the very great difficulty in acquiring that language, in which
the learning of the Hindoos is contained; or by that impenetrable veil of
myſtery with which the Brahmins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly cover their religious
tenets and philoſophy.</p>
            <p>Theſe circumſtances combining together, have opened an ample
field for fiction. Modern travellers have accordingly indulged their talent for
fable, upon the myſterious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Hindoſtan. Whether the ridiculous
tales they relate, proceed from that common partiality which Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, as
well as leſs enlightened nations, entertain for the religion and philoſophy
of their own country, or from a judgment formed upon ſome external ceremonies
of the Hindoos, is very difficult to determine; but they have prejudiced Europe
againſt the Brahmins, and by a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair account, have thrown diſgrace
upon a ſyſtem of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and philoſophy, which they did by no means
inveſtigate.</p>
            <p>The author of this diſſertation muſt own, that he for a long
time, ſuffered himſelf to be carried down in this ſtream of popular
prejudice. The preſent decline of literature in Hindoſtan, ſerved to
confirm him in his belief of thoſe legends which he read in Europe,
concerning the Brah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins. But converſing by accident, one day, with a noble
and learned Brahmin, he was not a little ſurprized to find him perfectly
acquainted with thoſe opinions, which, both in ancient and modern Europe,
have employed the pens of the moſt celebrated moraliſts. This
circumſtance did not fail to excite his curioſity, and in the courſe of
many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:0828000201:31"/> converſations, he found that
philoſophy and the ſciences had, in former ages, made a very conſiderable
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>Having then no intention to quit India for ſome time, he
reſolved to acquire ſome knowledge in the Shanſcrita lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; the grand
repoſitory of the religion, philoſophy and hiſtory of the Hindoos. With
this view, he prevailed upon his noble friend the Brahmin, to procure for him a
Pundit, from the univerſity of Benaris, well verſed in the Shanſcrita,
and maſter of all the knowledge of that learned body. But before he had made
any conſiderable progreſs in his ſtudies, an unexpected change of affairs
in Bengal, broke off all his literary ſchemes. He found that the time he had
to remain in India would be too ſhort to acquire the Shanſcrita. He
determined therefore, through the medium of the Perſian language, and through
the vulgar tongue of the Hindoos, to inform himſelf as much as poſſible,
concerning the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology and philoſophy of the Brahmins. He, for this
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, procured ſome of the principal SHASTERS, and his Pundit explained
to him, as many paſſages of thoſe curious books, as ſerved to give him
a general idea of the doctrine which they contain.</p>
            <p>It is but juſtice to the Brahmins to confeſs that the author
of this diſſertation is very ſenſible of his own inability to
illuſtrate, with that fullneſs and perſpicuity which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that
ſymbolical religion, which they are at ſo much pains to conceal from
foreigners. He however can aver, that he has not miſrepreſented one
ſingle circumſtance or tenet, though many may have eſcaped his
obſervation.</p>
            <p> 
               <pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:0828000201:32"/> The books which contain the religion and
philoſophy of the Hindoos, are diſtinguiſhed by the name of Bedas. They
are four in number, and like the ſacred writings of other nations, are ſaid
to have been penned by the divinity. Beda in the Shanſcrita, literally
ſignifies SCIENCE: for theſe books not only treat of religious and moral
duties, but of every branch of philoſophical knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Bedas are, by the Brahmins, held ſo ſacred, that they
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no other ſect to read them; and ſuch is the influence of
ſuperſtition and prieſt-craft over the minds of the other CASTS in India,
that they would deem it an unpardonable ſin to ſatisfy their curioſity in
that reſpect, were it even within the compaſs of their power. The Brahmins
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are bound by ſuch ſtrong ties of religion, to confine thoſe
writings to their own tribe, that were any of them known to read them to
others, he would be immediately excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. This puniſhment is worſe
than even death it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among the Hindoos. The offender is not only thrown
down from the nobleſt order to the moſt polluted CAST, but his poſterity
are rendered for ever incapable of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into his former dignity.</p>
            <p>All theſe things conſidered, we are not to wonder that the
doctrine of the Bedas is ſo little known in Europe. Even the literary part of
the Mahomedans of Aſia, reckon it an abſtruſe and myſterious ſubject,
and candidly confeſs, that it is covered with a veil of darkneſs, which
they could never penetrate. Some have indeed ſuppoſed, that the learned
Feizi, brother to the celebrated Abul Fazil, chief ſecretary to the Emperor
Akbar, had read the Bedas, and diſcovered the religious tenets contained in
them to that renowned Prince. <pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:0828000201:33"/> As the ſtory of Feizi
made a good deal of noiſe in the eaſt, it may not be improper to give the
particulars of it in this place.</p>
            <p>Mahummud Akbar being a prince of elevated and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ideas,
was totally diveſted of thoſe prejudices for his own religion, which men of
inferior parts not only imbibe with their mother's milk, but retain throughout
their lives. Though bred in all the ſtrictneſs of the Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medan faith,
his great ſoul in his riper years, broke thoſe chains of ſuperſtition
and credulity, with which his tutors had, in his early youth, fettered his
mind. With a deſign to chuſe his own religion, or rather from curioſity,
he made it his buſineſs to enquire minutely into all the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of
divinity, which prevailed among mankind. The ſtory of his being inſtructed
in the chriſtian tenets, by a miſſionary from Portugal, is too well known
in Europe to require a place in this diſſertation. As almoſt all
religions admit of proſelytes, Akbar had good ſucceſs in his enquiries,
till he came to his own ſubjects the Hindoos. Contrary to the practice of all
other religious ſects, they admit of no converts; but they allow that every
one may go to heaven his own way, though they perhaps ſuppoſe, that theirs
is the moſt expeditious method to obtain that important end. They chuſe
rather to make a myſtery of their religion, than impoſe it upon the world,
like the Mahommedans, with the ſword, or by means of the ſtake, after the
manner of ſome pious chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Not all the authority of Akbar could prevail with the Brahmins to
reveal the principles of their faith. He was therefore obliged to have
recourſe to artifice to obtain the information which he ſo much deſired.
The Emperor, for <pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:0828000201:34"/> this purpoſe, concerted a plan with
his chief ſecretary, Abul Fazil, to impoſe Feizi, then a boy, upon the
Brahmins, in the character of a poor orphan of their tribe. Feizi being
inſtructed in his part, was privately ſent to Benaris, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
ſeat of learning among the Hindoos. In that city the fraud was practiſed on
a learned Brahmin, who received the boy into his houſe, and educated him as
his own ſon.</p>
            <p>When Feizi, after ten years ſtudy, had acquired the
Shan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrita language, and all the knowledge of which the learned of Benaris
were poſſeſſed, proper meaſures were taken by the Emperor to ſecure
his ſafe return. Feizi it ſeems, during his reſidence with his patron the
Brahmin, was ſmitten with the beauty of his only daughter; and indeed the
ladies of the Brahmin race are the handſomeſt in Hindoſtan. The old
Brahmin ſaw the mutual paſſion of the young pair with pleaſure, and as
he loved Feizi for his uncommon abilities, he offered him his daughter in
marriage. Feizi, perplexed between love and gratitude, at length diſcovered
himſelf to the good old man, fell down at his feet, and graſping his knees,
ſolicited with tears for forgiveneſs, for the great crime he had committed
againſt his indulgent benefactor. The Brahmin, ſtruck dumb with
aſtoniſhment, uttered not one word of reproach. He drew a dagger, which he
always carried on his girdle, and prepared to plunge it in his own breaſt.
Feizi ſeized his hand, and conjured him, that if yet any atonement could be
made for the injury he had done him, he himſelf would ſwear to deny him
nothing. The Brahmin, burſting into tears, told him, that if Feizi ſhould
grant him two requeſts, he would forgive him, and conſent to live. Feizi,
without any heſitation, conſented, and the <pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:0828000201:35"/>
Brahmin's requeſts were, that he ſhould never tranſlate the Bedas, nor
repeat the creed of the Hindoos.</p>
            <p>How far Feizi was bound by his oath not to reveal the doctrine of
the Bedas to Akbar is uncertain; but that neither he, nor any other perſon,
ever tranſlated thoſe books, is a truth beyond any diſpute. It is however
well known, that the Emperor afterwards greatly favoured the Hindoo faith, and
gave much offence to zealous Mahommedans, by prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing ſome Indian
cuſtoms which they thought ſavoured of idolatry. But the
diſpaſſionate part of mankind have always allowed, that Akbar was equally
diveſted of all the follies of both the religious ſuperſtitions, which
prevailed among his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>To return from this digreſſion, the Brahmins maintain, that
the Bedas are the divine laws, which Brimha, at the creation of the world,
delivered for the inſtruction of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But they affirm that their meaning
was perverted in the firſt age, by the ignorance and wickedneſs of ſome
princes, whom they repreſent as evil ſpirits who then haunted the earth.
They call thoſe evil genii Dewtas, and tell many ſtrange allegorical
legends concerning them; ſuch as, that the Bedas being loſt, were
afterwards recovered by Biſhen, in the form of a fiſh, who brought them up
from the bottom of the ocean, into which they were thrown by a Deo, or
Demon.</p>
            <p>The firſt credible account we have of the Bedas, is, that about
the commencement of the Cal Jug, of which aera the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent year 1768, is the
4886th year, they were written, or rather collected by a great philoſopher,
and reputed prophet, called Beäſs Muni, or Beäſs the inſpired.
This learned man is <pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:0828000201:36"/> otherwiſe called Kriſhen
Basdeo, and is ſaid to have lived in the reign of Judiſhter, in the city of
Hiſtanapore, upon the river Jumna, near the preſent city of Delhi.</p>
            <p>The Brahmins do not give to Beäſs Muni the merit of being
the author of the Bedas. They however acknowledge, that he reduced them into
the preſent form, dividing them into four diſtinct books, after having
collected the detached pieces of which they are compoſed, from every part of
India. It is, upon the whole, probable, that they are not the work of one man,
on account of their immenſe bulk.</p>
            <p>The Mahomedans of Aſia, as well as ſome of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of
Europe, have miſtaken Brimha, an allegorical perſon, for ſome
philoſopher of repute in India, whom they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh by the disfigured
names of Bruma, Burma, and Bramha, whom they ſuppoſe to have been the
writer of the religious books of the Hindoos. Feriſhta, in the hiſtory now
given to the public, affirms, that Brimha was of the race of Bang, and
flouriſhed in the reign of Kriſhen, firſt monarch of Hindoſtan. But the
Brahmins deny, that any ſuch perſon ever exiſted, which we have reaſon
to believe is the truth; as Brimha in the Shanſcrita language allegorically
ſignifies WISDOM, one of the principal attributes of the ſupreme
divinity.</p>
            <p>The four Bedas contain 100,000 aſhlogues or ſtanzas in
verſe, each of which conſiſts of four lines. The firſt Beda is called
RUG BEDA, which ſignifies the ſcience of divination, concerning which it
principally treats. It alſo contains aſtrology, aſtronomy, natural
philoſophy, and a very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of the creation of matter, and the
formation of the world.</p>
            <p> 
               <pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:0828000201:37"/> The ſecond Beda is diſtinguiſhed by
the name of SHEHAM. That word ſignifies piety or devotion, and this book
accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly treats of all religious and moral duties. It alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains many
hymns in praiſe of the ſupreme being, as well as verſes in honour of
ſubaltern intelligences.</p>
            <p>The third is the JUDGER BEDA, which, as the word implies,
comprehends the whole ſcience of religious rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; ſuch as
faſts, feſtivals, purifications, penances, pilgrimages, ſacrifices,
prayers, and offerings. They give the appellation of OBATAR BAH to the fourth
Beda. OBA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAR ſignifies in the Shanſcrita, the being, or the eſſence,
and BAH good; ſo that the Obatar Bah is literally the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the good
being, and accordingly this book compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the whole ſcience of theology
and metaphyſical philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</p>
            <p>The language of the Obatar Bah Beda is now become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolete;
ſo that very few Brahmins pretend to read it with propriety. Whether this
proceeds from its great antiquity, or from its being wrote in an uncommon
dialect of the Shanſcrita, is hard to determine. We are inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the firſt is the truth; for we can by no means agree with a late
ingenious writer<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Holwell: The author of the
diſſertation finds himſelf obliged to differ almoſt in every particular
concerning the religion of the Hindoos, from that gentleman.</note>, who
affirms, that the Obatar Bah was written in a period poſterior to the reſt
of the Bedas.</p>
            <p>It has been already obſerved, that the Bedas are written in the
Shanſcrita tongue. Whether the Shanſcrita was, in any period of antiquity,
the vulgar language of Hindoſtan, <pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:0828000201:38"/> or was invented by
the Brahmins, to be a myſterious repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory for their religion and
philoſophy, is difficult to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. All other languages, it is true, were
caſually invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mankind, to expreſs their ideas and wants; but the
aſtoniſhing formation of the Shanſcrita ſeems to be beyond the power of
chance. In regularity of etymology and gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical order, it far exceeds the
Arabic. It, in ſhort, bears evident marks, that it has been fixed upon
rational prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by a body of learned men, who ſtudied regularity,
harmony, and a wonderful ſimplicity and energy of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <p>Though the Shanſcrita is amazingly copious, a very ſmall
grammar and vocabulary ſerve to illuſtrate the principles of the whole. In
a treatiſe of a few pages, the roots and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitives are all comprehended,
and ſo uniform is the rules for derivations and inflections, that the etymon
of every word is, with the greateſt facility, at once inveſtigated. The
pronunciation is the greateſt difficulty which attends the acquirement of the
language to perfection. This is ſo quick and forcible, that a perſon, even
before the years of puber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, muſt labour a long time before he can pronounce
it with propriety; but when once that is attained to perfection, it ſtrikes
the ear with amazing boldneſs and harmony. The alphabet of the Shanſcrita
conſiſts of fifty letters, but one half of theſe carry combined ſounds,
ſo that its characters in fact, do not exceed ours in number. Some ſmall
idea of the Shanſcrita may be conveyed by the annexed plate, which contains
the alphabet, and the meaſure of the four Bedas.</p>
            <p>Before we ſhall proceed to the religion and philoſophy of the
Brahmins, it may not be improper to premiſe ſomething <pb facs="tcp:0828000201:39"/>

               <pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:0828000201:40"/> concerning the moſt characteriſtical
manners and cuſtoms of the Hindoos in general. The Hindoos are ſo called
from Indoo or Hindoo, which, in the Shanſcrita language, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the
Moon; for from that luminary, and the ſun, they deduce their fabulous origin.
The author of the diſſertation has in his poſſeſſion, a long liſt
of a dynaſty of Kings, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hindoo-buns or Chunder-buns, both of which
words mean, the Children of the Moon. He alſo has a catalogue of the
Surage-buns, or the Children of the Sun, from whom many of the Rajas of
Hindoſtan pretend to derive their blood. Hindoſtan, the domeſtic
appellation of India, is a compoſition of Hindoo, and Stan, a region; and the
great river Indus takes its name from the people, and not the people from the
river, as has been erroneouſly ſuppoſed in Europe.</p>
            <p>The Hindoos have, from all antiquity, been divided into four great
tribes, each of which comprehend a variety of inferior caſts. Theſe tribes
do not intermarry, eat, drink, or in any manner aſſociate with one another,
except when they worſhip at the temple of Jagga-nat<note n="†" place="bottom">Jagga nat ſignifies Lord of the creation. This is one of the
names of Biſhen and the Obatar, or Being, who is ſaid to preſide over the
preſent period. He is repreſented under the figure of a fat man, ſitting
croſs-legged, with his arms hanging down by his ſide as if they had no
ſtrength. This laſt circumſtance alludes to the imbecility of this age.
His temple is in the greateſt repute of any now in India.</note> in
Oriſſa, where it is held a crime to make any diſtinction. The firſt and
moſt noble tribe are the Brahmins, who alone can officiate in the
prieſthood, like the Levites among the Jews. They are not however excluded
from government, trade, or agriculture, though they are ſtrictly prohibited
from all menial offices by their laws. They derive their name from Brimha, who
they allegorically ſay, produced the Brahmins from his head, when he created
the world.</p>
            <p> 
               <pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:0828000201:41"/> The ſecond in order is the Sittri tribe, who
are ſometimes diſtinguiſhed by the name of Kittri or Koytri. They,
according to their original inſtitution, ought to be all mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary men; but
they frequently follow other profeſſions. Brimha is ſaid to have produced
the Kittri from his heart, as an emblem of that courage which warriors ſhould
poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>The name of Beiſe or Biſe is given to the third tribe. They are for
the moſt part, merchants, bankers, and bunias or ſhop-keepers. Theſe are
figuratively ſaid to have ſprung from the belly of Brimha; the word Beiſh
ſignifying a provider or nouriſher. The fourth tribe is that of Sudder.
They ought to be menial ſervants, and they are incapable to raiſe
themſelves to any ſuperior rank. They are ſaid to have proceeded from the
feet of Brimha, in alluſion to their low degree. But indeed it is contrary to
the inviolable laws of the Hindoos, that any perſon ſhould riſe from an
inferior caſt into a higher tribe. If any therefore ſhould be
excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from any of the four tribes, he and his poſterity are forever
ſhut out from ſociety of every body in the nation, excepting that of the
Harri caſt, who are held in utter deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by all the other tribes, and
are employed only in the meaneſt and vileſt offices. This circumſtance
renders excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication ſo dreadful, that any Hindoo will ſuffer the
tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and even death itſelf, rather than deviate from one article of his
faith. This ſeverity prevented all intermixture of blood between the tribes,
ſo that, in their appearance, they ſeem rather four different nations, than
members of the ſame community.</p>
            <p>It is, as we have already obſerved, a principle peculiar to the Hindoo
religion, not to admit of proſelytes. Inſtead of <pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:0828000201:42"/>
being ſolicitous about gaining converts, they always make a myſtery of
their faith. Heaven, ſay they, is like a palace with many doors, and every
one may enter in his own way. But this charitable diſpoſition never
encouraged other ſects to ſettle among them, as they muſt have been
excluded en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely from all the benefits of ſociety.</p>
            <p>When a child is born, ſome of the Brahmins are called. They pretend,
from the horoſcope of his nativity, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel his future fortune, by means
of ſome aſtrological tables, of which they are poſſeſſed. When this
ceremony is over, they burn incenſe, and make an offering according to the
circumſtances of the parent; and without ever conſulting them, tie the
zinar<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſtring which all the Hindoos wear, by way of
charm or amulet.</note> round the infant's neck, and impoſe a name upon him,
according to their own fancy.</p>
            <p>Between the age of ſeven and ten, the children are, by their parents,
given away in marriage. The young pair are brought together, in order to
contract an intimacy with one another. But when they approach to the years of
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they carefully ſeparate them, till the female produces ſigns of
womanhood. She then is taken from her parents to cohabit with her huſband:
nor is ſhe ever after permitted to viſit them. It is not lawful among the
Hindoos to marry nearer than the eighth degree of kindred. Polygamy is
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but ſeldom practiſed; for they very rationally think, that one
wife is ſufficient for one man.</p>
            <p>The extraordinary cuſtom of the women burning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their
deceaſed huſbands, has, for the moſt part, fallen into deſuetude in
India; nor was it ever reckoned a <pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:0828000201:43"/> religious duty, as
has been very erroneouſly ſuppoſed in the Weſt. This ſpecies of
barbarity, like many others, roſe originally from the fooliſh
enthuſiaſm of feeble minds. In a text in the Bedas, conjugal affection and
fidelity are thus figuratively inculcated: 
<q rend="inline">"The woman, in ſhort, who dies with her huſband,
ſhall enjoy life eternal with him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven."</q> From this ſource the
Brahmins themſelves deduce this ridiculous cuſtom, which is a more rational
ſolution of it, than the ſtory which prevails in Europe; that it was a
poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical inſtitution, made by one of the Emperors, to prevent wives from
poiſoning their huſbands, a practice, in thoſe days, common in
Hindoſtan.</p>
            <p>People of rank and thoſe of the higher caſts, burn their dead and
throw ſome incenſe into the pile. Some throw the bodies of their friends
into the Ganges, while others expoſe them on the high ways, as a prey to
vultures and wild beaſts. There is one caſt in the kingdom of Bengal, who
barbarouſly expoſe their ſick by the river's ſide to die there. They
even ſometimes choak them with mud, when they think them paſt hopes of
recovery. They defend this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human cuſtom by ſaying, that life is not an
adequate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the tortures of a lingering diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The Hindoos have a code of laws in the NEA SHASTER. Treaſon, inceſt,
ſacrilege, murder, adultery with the wife of a Brahmin, and theft, are
capital crimes. Though the Brahmins were the authors of thoſe laws, we do not
find that they have exempted themſelves from the puniſhment of death, when
guilty of thoſe crimes. This is one of thoſe numerous fables, which modern
travellers imported from the Eaſt. It is however certain, that the influence
of the <pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:0828000201:44"/> Brahmins is ſo great, and their characters as
prieſts ſo ſacred, that they eſcape in caſes where no mercy would be
ſhewn to the other tribes.</p>
            <p>Petty offences are puniſhed by temporary excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
pilgrimages, penances and fines, according to the degree of the crime, and the
wealth of the guilty perſon. But as the Hindoos are now, for the moſt part,
ſubject to the Mahommedans, they are governed by the laws of the Koran, or by
the arbitrary will of the prince.</p>
            <p>The Senaſſeys are a ſect of mendicant philoſophers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
known by the name of Fakiers, which literally ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies poor people. Theſe
idle and pretended devotees, aſſemble ſometimes in armies of ten or
twelve thouſand, and, under a pretext of making pilgrimages to certain
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, lay whole countries under contribution. Theſe ſaints wear no
clothes, are generally very robuſt, and convert the wives of the leſs holy
part of mankind to their own uſe, upon their religious progreſſes. They
admit any man of parts into their number, and they take great care to
inſtruct their diſciples in every branch of knowledge, to make the order
the more revered among the vulgar.</p>
            <p>When this naked army of robuſt ſaints direct their march to any
temple, the men of the provinces through which their road lies, very often fly
before them, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſanctified character of the Fakiers.
But the women are in general more reſolute, and not only remain in their
dwellings, but apply frequently for the prayers of thoſe holy perſons,
which are found to be moſt effectual in caſes of ſterility. When a Takier
is at prayers with the lady of <pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:0828000201:45"/> the houſe, he leaves
either his ſlipper or his ſtaff at the door, which if ſeen by the
huſband, effectually prevents him from diſturbing their devotion. But
ſhould he be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as not to mind thoſe ſignals, a ſound
drubbing is the inevitable conſequence of his intruſion.</p>
            <p>Though the Fakiers inforce with their arms, that reverence which the
people of Hindoſtan have naturally for their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they inflict voluntary
penances of very extraordinary kinds upon themſelves, to gain more reſpect.
Theſe fellows ſometimes hold up one arm in a fixed poſition till it
becomes ſtiff, and remains in that ſituation during the reſt of their
lives. Some clench their fiſts very hard, and keep them ſo till their nails
grow into their palms, and appear through the back of their hands. Others turn
their faces over one ſhoulder, and keep them in that ſituation, till they
fix for ever their heads looking backward. Many turn their eyes to the point of
their noſe, till they have loſt the power of looking in any other
direction. Theſe laſt, pretend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſee what they call the
ſacred fire, which viſion, no doubt, proceeds from ſome diſorder
ariſing from the diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the optic nerves.</p>
            <p>It often appears to Europeans in India, a matter of ſome ridicule to
converſe with thoſe diſtorted and naked philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; though their
knowledge and external appearance, exhibit a very ſtriking contraſt. Some
are really what they ſeem, enthuſiaſts; but others put on the character
of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, as a cloak for their pleaſures. But what actually makes them
a public nuiſance, and the averſion of poor huſbands, is, that the women
think they derive ſome holineſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, from an intimacy with a
Fakier.</p>
            <p> 
               <pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:0828000201:46"/> Many other fooliſh cuſtoms, beſides
thoſe we have mentioned, are peculiar to thoſe religious mendicants. But
enthuſiaſtic penances are not confined to them alone. Some of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
on the faſt of Oppoſs, ſuſpend themſelves on iron hooks, by the
fleſh of the ſhoulder-blade, to the end of a beam. This beam turns round
with great velocity, upon a pivot, on the head of a high pole. The
enthuſiaſt not only ſeems inſenſible of pain, but very often blows a
trumpet as he is whirled round above, and, at certain intervals, ſings a
ſong to the gaping multitude below; who very much admire his fortitude and
devotion. This ridiculous cuſtom is kept up to commemorate the ſufferings
of a martyr, who was in that manner, tortured for his faith.</p>
            <p>To dwell longer upon the characteriſtical cuſtoms and manners of the
Hindoos, would extend this diſſertation too far. Some more particulars
concerning that nation, will naturally ariſe from an inveſtigation of their
religion and philoſophy. This laſt was the capital deſign of this
intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory diſcourſe; and we hope to be able to throw a new, if not a
compleat light, on a ſubject hitherto little underſtood in the Weſt. Some
writers have very lately given to the world, an unintelligible ſyſtem of
the Brahmin religion; and they affirm, that they derived their information from
the Hindoos themſelves. This may be the caſe, but they certainly
converſed upon that ſubject only with the inferior tribes, or with the
unlearned part of the Brahmins: and it would be as ridiculous to hope for a
true ſtate of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and philoſophy of the Hindoos from thoſe
illiterate caſts, as it would be in a Mahommedan in London, to rely upon the
accounts of a pariſh beadle, concerning the moſt abſtruſe points of the
Chriſtian faith; or, to form his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:0828000201:47"/> of the
principles of the Newtonian philoſophy, from a converſation with an
Engliſh carman.</p>
            <p>The Hindoos are divided into two great religious ſects: the followers
of the doctrine of the BEDANG; and thoſe who adhere to the principles of the
NEADIRSIN. As the firſt are eſteemed the moſt orthodox, as well as the
moſt ancient, we ſhall begin to explain their opinions, by extracts
literally tranſlated from the original SHASTER<note n="a" place="bottom">Shaſter literally ſignifies Knowledge: but it is commonly
underſtood to mean a book which treats of divinity and the ſciences. There
are many Shaſters among the Hindoos; ſo that thoſe writers who affirmed,
that there was but one Shaſter in India, which, like the Bible of the
Chriſtians, or Koran of the followers of Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, contained the firſt
principles of the Brahmin ſaith, have deceived themſelves and the
public.</note>, which goes by the name of Bedang.</p>
            <p>Bedang, the title of the Shaſter, or commentary upon the Bedas,
concerning which we are about to treat, is a word compounded of Beda,
<hi>ſcience,</hi> and Ang, <hi>body.</hi> The name of this Shaſter
therefore, may be literally tranſlated, the Body of ſcience. This book has,
in Europe, been errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly called Vedam; and it is an expoſition of the
doctrine of the Bedas, by that great philoſopher and prophet Beâſs
Muni, who, according to the Brahmins, flouriſhed about four thouſand years
ago. The Bedang is ſaid to have been reviſed ſome ages after
Beâſs Muni, by one Sirrider Swami, ſince which it has been reckoned
ſacred, and not ſubject to any further alterations. Almoſt all the
Hindoos of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, and thoſe of the Malabar and Coromandel coaſts, are
of the ſect of the Bedang.</p>
            <p> 
               <pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:0828000201:48"/> This commentary opens with a dialogue between
Brimha<note n="b" place="bottom">Brimha is the genitive caſe of BRIMH, which is
a primitive ſignifying GOD. He is called Brimha or WISDOM, the firſt
attribute of the ſupreme divinity. The divine wiſdom, under the name of
Brimha, is figuratively repreſented with one head, having four faces, looking
to the four quarters, alluding to his ſeeing all things. Upon the head of
this figure is a crown, an emblem of power and dominion. He has four hands,
implying, the omnipotence of divine wiſdom. In the firſt hand he holds the
four Bedas, as a ſymbol of knowledge; in the ſecond a ſcepter, as a token
of authority; and in the third a ring, or compleat circle, as an emblem of
eternity. Brimha holds nothing in the fourth hand, which implies, that THE
WISDOM OF GOD is always ready to lend his aid to his creatures. He is
repreſented riding upon a gooſe, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of ſimplicity among the
Hindoos. The latter circumſtance is intended to imply the ſimplicity of the
operations of nature, which is but another name for the wiſdom of the
divinity. Theſe explications of the inſignia of Brimha, were given by the
Brah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and are, by no means, conjectures of the author of this
diſſertation.</note>, the Wiſdom of the Divinity; and Narud<note n="c" place="bottom">Narud literally ſignifies REASON, emphatically called the ſon
of THE WISDOM OF GOD. He is ſaid to be the firſt-born of the MUNIS, of whom
hereafter.</note> or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who is repreſented as the ſon of Brimha.
Narud de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be inſtructed by his father, and for that purpoſe, puts
the following queſtions to him.</p>

This is one of the thouſand names of GOD, which have ſo much perplexed the
writers of Europe. In the anſwer of Brimha, mention is made of the firſt
three great deities of the Hindoos; which three, however, they by no means
worſhip as diſtinct beings from God, but only as his principal
attributes.</note>, and a part of his being, whom he called forth to execute
his eternal deſigns.</p>

                  <p>Affection<note n="p" place="bottom">Maiah, which ſignifies either

three different kinds, the creative<note n="q" place="bottom">Redjo-goon, the
creative quality.</note>, the preſerving<note n="r" place="bottom">Sittohgoon,
the preſerving quality.</note>, and the deſtructive<note n="s" place="bottom">Timmugoon, the deſtructive quality.</note>. This firſt is
repreſented by Brimha, the ſecond <pb n="xli" facs="tcp:0828000201:50"/> by Biſhen<note n="t" place="bottom">The preſerver; Providence is perſonified under the name
of Biſhen.</note>, and the third by Shibah<note n="u" place="bottom">Shibah,
the foe of good.</note>. You, O Narud! are taught to worſhip all the three,
in various ſhapes and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as the creator<note n="w" place="bottom">Naat.</note>, the preſerver<note n="x" place="bottom">Biſhen.</note>, and the deſtroyer<note n="y" place="bottom">Shibah. The Hindoos worſhip the deſtructive attribute of the
divinity, under the name of Shibah; but they do not mean evil by Shibah, for
they affirm, that there is no ſuch thing but what proceeds from the free
agency of man.</note>. The affection of God then produced power<note n="z" place="bottom">Jotna.</note>, and power at a proper conjunction of time<note n="a" place="bottom">Kaal.</note> and fate<note n="b" place="bottom">Addariſto.</note>, embraced goodneſs<note n="c" place="bottom">Pir-kirti, from <hi>Pir</hi> good, and <hi>Kirti</hi> action.
God's attribute of goodneſs, is worſhipped as a Goddeſs, under the name
of Pirkirti, and many other appellations, which comprehend all the virtues. It
has been ridiculouſly ſuppoſed in Europe, that PURRUS and PIRKIRTI were
the firſt man and woman, according to the ſyſtem of the Hindoos; whereas
by Purrus is meant God, or emphatically, <hi>the Being</hi>; and by Pirkirti,
his attribute of goodneſs.</note>, and produced matter<note n="d" place="bottom">Mohat. In other places of the Bedang, matter is diſtinguiſhed
by the name of Maha-tit, <hi>the great ſubſtance.</hi>
                     </note>. The three
qualities then acting upon matter, produced the univerſe in the following
manner. From the oppoſite actions of the creative and deſtructive quality
in matter, ſelf-motion<note n="e" place="bottom">Ahankar. The word literally
ſignifies ſelf-action.</note> firſt aroſe. Self-motion was of three
kinds; the firſt inclining to plaſticity<note n="f" place="bottom">Rajas.</note>, the ſecond to diſcord<note n="g" place="bottom">Tamas.</note>, and the third to reſt<note n="h" place="bottom">Satig.</note>. The diſcordant actions then produced the
Akaſh<note n="i" place="bottom">A kind of celeſtial element. The Bedang in
another place, ſpeaks of akaſh as a pure impalpable element, through which
the planets move. This element, ſays the philoſopher, makes no
reſiſtance, and therefore the planets continue their motion, from the
firſt impulſe which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the hand of Brimha or God; nor will
they ſtop, ſays he, till he ſhall ſeize them in the midſt of their
courſe.</note>, which inviſible element poſſeſſed the quality of
conveying ſound; it produced air<note n="k" place="bottom">Baiow.</note>, a
palpable element, fire<note n="l" place="bottom">Tege.</note>, a viſible
element, water<note n="m" place="bottom">Joal.</note>, a fluid element, and
earth<note n="n" place="bottom">Prittavi.</note>, a ſolid element.</p>
                  <p>The Akaſh diſperſed itſelf abroad. Air formed the

being forced from beneath by the gravity of the latter element. Thus broke
forth the world from the veil of darkneſs, in which it was formerly
comprehended by God. Order roſe over the univerſe. The ſeven heavens were
formed<note n="p" place="bottom">The names of the ſeven heavens are, Bu, Buba,
Surg, Moha, Junnoh, Tapu, and Sutteh. The ſeven worlds are, Ottal, Bittal,
Suttal, Joal, Tallattal, Riſſatal, and Pattal. The author of the
diſſertation, by a negligence which he very much regrets, forgot to get the
proper explanation of thoſe names, or the uſes to which the ſeven heavens
were converted.</note>, and the ſeven worlds were fixed in their places;
there to remain till the great diſſolution<note n="q" place="bottom">Mah-pirly.</note>, when all things ſhall be abſorbed<note n="r" place="bottom">Mucht.</note> into God.</p>
                  <p>God ſeeing the earth in full bloom, and that vegetation<note n="s" place="bottom">Birgalotta.</note> was ſtrong from its ſeeds, called forth for

If therefore man ſhall adhere to the firſt, as far as his powers ſhall

in this place, to ſay ſomething concerning the Hindoo method of computing
time. Their leaſt ſubdiviſion of time is, the Nemiſh or twinkling of an
eye. Three Nemiſh's make one Kaan, fifty Kaan one Ligger, ten Liggers one
Dind, two Dinds one Gurry, equal to forty-five of our minutes; four Gurries one
Pâr, eight Pârs one Dien or day, fifteen Diens one Packa, two
Packas one Mâſh, two Mâſhes one Ribbi, three Ribbis one Aioon

minutes, wanting of a ſolar year, amount to one revolution of the moon, an
additional month is made to that year to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt the Callendar. A year of 360
days, they reckon but one day to the Dewtas or hoſt of Heaven; and they
ſay, that twelve thouſand of thoſe planetary years, make one revolution
of the four Jugs or periods, into which they divide the ages of the world. The
Sittoh Jug or age of truth contained, according to them, four thouſand
planetary years. The Treta Jug, or age of three, contained three thouſand
years. The Duapur Jug, or <hi>age of two,</hi> contained two thouſand; and
the Kallé Jug, or age of pollution, conſiſts of only one thouſand.
To theſe they add two other periods, between the diſſolution and
renovation of the world, which they call Sundeh, and Sundaſs, each of a

that it was impoſſible to underſtand it, without a compleat knowledge of
the Shanſcrita. The author of the Bedang, thinking perhaps, that the
philoſophical catechiſm which we have tranſlated above, was too pure for
narrow and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious minds, has inſerted into his work, a ſtrange
alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical account of the creation, for the purpoſes of vulgar theology. In
this tale, the attributes of God, the human paſſions and faculties of the

            <q> 
               <p>BRIMH exiſted from all eternity, in a form of infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions.

and four hands, Brimha gazing round, and ſeeing nothing but the immenſe
image, out of which he had proceeded, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled a thouſand years, to
endeavour to comprehend its dimenſions. But after all his toil, he found

               <p>Loſt in amazement, Brimha gave over his journey. He fell proſtrate
and praiſed what he ſaw, with his four mouths. The almighty, then, with a
voice like ten thouſand thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was pleaſed to ſay: Thou haſt done
well, O Brimha, for thou canſt not comprehend me!—Go and create the
world!—How can I create it?—Aſk of me, and power ſhall be given

as if floating before his eyes. He ſaid, LET THEM BE, and all that he ſaw
became real before him. Then fear ſtruck the frame of Brimha, leſt thoſe
things ſhould be annihilated. O immortal Brimh! he cried, who ſhall
preſerve thoſe things which I behold. In the inſtant a ſpirit of a blue
colour iſſued from Brimha's mouth, and ſaid aloud, I WILL. Then ſhall
thy name be Biſhen<note n="l" place="bottom">The providence of God.</note>,
becauſe thou haſt undertaken to preſerve all things.</p> 
               <p>Brimha then commanded Biſhen to go and create all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, with
vegetables for their ſubſiſtance, to poſſeſs that earth which he
himſelf had made. Biſhen forthwith created all manner of beaſts, fiſh,
foul, inſects and reptiles. Trees and graſs roſe alſo beneath his
hands, for Brimha had inveſted him with power. But man was ſtill wanting to
rule the whole: and Brimha commanded Biſhen to form him. Biſhen began the
work, but the men he made were idiots with great bellies, for he could not
inſpire them with knowledge; ſo that in every thing but in ſhape, they
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the beaſts of the field. They had no paſſion but to

               <p>Brimha, offended at the men, deſtroyed them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced four
perſons from his own breath, whom he called by four different names. The name
of the firſt was Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noc<note n="m" place="bottom">Body.</note>, of the
ſecond, Sinnunda<note n="n" place="bottom">Life.</note>, of the third,
Sonnatin<note n="o" place="bottom">Permanency.</note>, and of the fourth,
Sonninkunar<note n="p" place="bottom">Intellectual exiſtence.</note>. Theſe
four perſons were ordered by Brimha, to rule over the creatures, and to
poſſeſs <pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:0828000201:57"/> for ever the world. But they refuſed
to do any thing but to praiſe God, having nothing of the deſtructive
quality<note n="a" place="bottom">Timmu-goon.</note> in their compoſition.</p> 
               <p>Brimha, for this contempt of his orders, became angry, and lo! a brown
ſpirit ſtarted from between his eyes. He ſat down before Brimha, and
began to weep: then lifting up his eyes, he aſked him, 
<q rend="inline">"Who am I, and where ſhall be the place of my
abode."</q> Thy name ſhall be Rudder<note n="b" place="bottom">The weeper;
becauſe he was produced in tears. One of the names of Shibah, the
deſtructive attribute of the Divinity.</note>, ſaid Brimha, and all nature
ſhall be the place of thine abode. But riſe up, O Rudder! and form man to
govern the world.</p> 
               <p>Rudder immediately obeyed the orders of Brimha. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the work, but
the men he made were fiercer than tigers, having nothing but the deſtructive
quality in their compoſitions. They, however, ſoon deſtroyed one another,
for anger was their only paſſion. Brimha, Biſhen, and Rudder then joined
their different powers. They created ten men, whoſe names were, Narud, Dico,
Baſhiſta, Birga, Kirku, Pulla, Puliſta, Ongira, Otteri and Murichi<note n="c" place="bottom">The ſignifications of theſe ten names are in order, theſe.
Reaſon, Ingenuity, Emulation, Humility, Piety, Pride, Patience, Charity,
Deceit, Mortality.</note>: The general appellation of the whole, was the
Munies<note n="d" place="bottom">The Inſpired.</note>. Brimha then produced
Dirmo<note n="e" place="bottom">Fortune.</note> from his breaſt, Adirmo<note n="f" place="bottom">Misfortune.</note> from his back, Loab<note n="g" place="bottom">Appetite.</note> from his lip, and Kâm<note n="h" place="bottom">Love.</note> from his heart. This laſt being a beautiful female,
Brimha looked upon her with amorous eyes. But the Munies told him, that ſhe
was his own daughter; upon which he ſhrunk back, and produced a bluſhing
virgin called Ludja<note n="i" place="bottom">Shame.</note>. Brimha thinking his
body defiled by throwing his <pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:0828000201:58"/> eyes upon Kâm,
changed it, and produced ten women, one of which was given to each of the
Munies.</p> 
            </q>
            <p>In this diviſion of the Bedang Shaſter, there is a long liſt of
the Surage Buns, or children of the ſun, who, it is ſaid, ruled the world
in the firſt periods. But as the whole is a mere dream of imagination, and
ſcarcely the belief of the Hindoo children and women, we ſhall not
treſpaſs further on the patience of the public with theſe allegories. The
Brahmins of former ages wrote many volumes of romances upon the lives and
actions of thoſe pretended Kings, incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, after their manner, morality
by fable. This was the grand fountain from which the religion of the vulgar in
India was corrupted; if the vulgar of any country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any adventitious aid
to corrupt their ideas, upon ſo myſterious a ſubject.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, the opinions of the author of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dang, upon the
ſubject of religion, are not unphiloſophical. He maintains that the world
was created out of nothing by God, and that it will be again annihilated. The
unity, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and omnipotence of the ſupreme divinity are inculcated by
him: for though he preſents us with a long liſt of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior beings, it is
plain that they are merely allegorical; and neither he nor the ſenſible
part of his followers believe their actual exiſtence. The more ignorant
Hindoos, it cannot be denied, think that theſe ſubaltern divinities do
exiſt, in the ſame manner, that Chriſtians believe in Angels: but the
unity of God was always a fundamental tenet of the uncorrupted faith of the
more learned Brahmins.</p>
            <p> 
               <pb n="l" facs="tcp:0828000201:59"/> The opinion of this philoſopher, that the ſoul,
after death, aſſumes a body of the purer elements, is not pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the
Brahmins. It deſcended from the Druids of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, to the Greeks, and was the
ſame with the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of Homer. His
idea of the manner of the tranſmigration of the human ſoul into various
bodies, is peculiar to himſelf. As he holds it as a maxim that a portion of
the GREAT SOUL or God, animates every living thing; he thinks it no ways
inconſiſtent, that the ſame portion that gave life to man, ſhould
afterwards paſs into the body of any other animal. This tranſmigration does
not, in his opinion, debaſe the quality of the ſoul: for when it extricates
itſelf from the fetters of the fleſh, it reaſſumes its original
nature.</p>
            <p>The followers of the BEDANG SHASTER do not allow that any phyſical
evil exiſts. They maintain that God created all things perfectly good, but
that man, being a free agent, may be guilty of moral evil: which, however, only
reſpects himſelf and ſociety, but is of no detriment to the general
ſyſtem of nature. God, ſay they, has no paſſion but bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence: and
being poſſeſſed of no wrath, he never puniſhes the wicked, but by the
pain and affliction which are the natural conſequences of evil actions. The
more learned Brahmins therefore affirm, that the hell which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in
the Bedang, was only intended as a mere bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to the vulgar, to inforce upon
their minds, the duties of morality: for that hell is no other than a
conſciouſneſs of evil, and thoſe bad conſequences which invariably
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low wicked deeds.</p>
            <p>Before we ſhall proceed to the doctrine of the NEADIRSEN SHASTER, it
may not be improper to give a tranſlation of the <pb n="li" facs="tcp:0828000201:60"/> firſt
chapter of the DIRM SHASTER, which throws a clear light upon the religious
tenets, common to both the grand ſects of the Hindoos. It is a dialogue
between Brimha, or the wiſdom of God; and Narud, or human reaſon.</p>

            <p>Without making any reflections upon this chapter of the DIRM SHASTER, it
appears evident, that the religion of the Hindoos has hitherto been very much
miſrepreſented in Europe. The followers of the NEADIRSEN SHASTER, differ
greatly in their philoſophy, from the ſect of the BEDANG, though both agree
about the unity of the ſupreme being. To give ſome idea of the Neadirſen
philoſophy, we ſhall, in this place, give ſome extracts from that
Shaſter.</p>
            <p>NEADIRSEN is a compound from NEA, ſignifying right, and DIRSEN, to
teach or explain; ſo that the word may be <pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:0828000201:65"/> tranſlated
an <hi>exhibition of truth.</hi> Though it is not reckoned ſo antient as the
Bedang, yet it is ſaid to have been written by a philoſopher called Goutam,
near four thouſand years ago. The philoſophy contained in this Shaſter,
is very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe and metaphyſical; and therefore it is but juſtice to
Goutam to confeſs, that the author of the diſſertation,
not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great pains he took to have proper defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the
terms, is by no means certain, whether he has fully attained his end. In this
ſtate of uncertainty he choſe to adhere to the literal meaning of words,
rather than by a free tranſlation, to deviate perhaps from the ſenſe of
his author.</p>
            <p>The generality of the Hindoos of Bengal, and all the northern provinces
of Hindoſtan, eſteem the NEADIRSEN a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Shaſter; but thoſe of
the Decan, Coromandel, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar, totally reject it. It conſiſts of
ſeven volumes. The firſt only came to the hands of the author of the
diſſertation, and he has, ſince his arrival in England, depoſited it in
the Britiſh Muſeum. He can ſay nothing for certain, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
contents of the ſubſequent volumes; only that they contain a compleat
ſyſtem of the theology and philoſophy of the Brahmins of the Neadirſen
ſect.</p>
            <p>Goutam does not begin to reaſon, <hi>a priori,</hi> like the writer of
the Bedang. He conſiders the preſent ſtate of nature, and the
intellectual faculties, as far as they can be inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by human
reaſon; and from thence he draws all his concluſions. He reduces all things
under ſix principal heads; ſubſtance, quality, motion, ſpecies,
aſſimulation, and conſtruction<note n="e" place="bottom">Theſe are in the
original Shanſcrita, Dirba, Goon, Kirmo, Summania, Biſheſh,
Sammabac.</note>. In ſubſtance, beſides time, ſpace, life, 
<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:0828000201:66"/> and ſpirit, he comprehends earth, water, fire, air,
and akaſh. The four groſſer elements, he ſays, come under the immediate
comprehenſion of our bodily ſenſes; and akaſh, time, ſpace, ſoul
and ſpirit, come under mental perception.</p>
            <p>He maintains, that all objects of perception are equally real, as we
cannot comprehend the nature of a ſolid cubit, any more than the ſame
extent of ſpace. He affirms, that diſtance in point of time and ſpace,
are equally incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible; ſo that if we ſhall admit, that ſpace is
a real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, time muſt be ſo too. That the ſoul, or vital
prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, is a ſubtile element, which pervades all things; for that
intellect, which, according to experience in animals, cannot proceed from
organization and vital motion only, muſt be a principle totally diſtinct
from them.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"The author of the Bedant<note n="f" place="bottom">A
ſyſtem of ſceptical philoſophy, to which many of the Brahmins
adhere.</note>," ſays Goutam, "finding the impoſſibility of forming an
idea of ſubſtance, aſſerts, that all nature is a mere deluſion. But
as imagination muſt be acted upon by ſome real exiſtence, as we cannot
conceive that it can act upon itſelf, we muſt conclude, that there is
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing real, otherwiſe philoſophy is at an end."</q>

Kirmo or motion is, according to him, of two kinds, direct and crooked.
Sammania, or ſpecies, which is his third principle, includes all animals and
natural productions. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheſh he defines to be a tendency in matter towards
produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and Sammabae, or the laſt principle, is the artificial
conſtruction or formation of things, as a ſtatue from a block of marble, a
houſe from ſtones, or cloth from cotton.</p>
            <p>Under theſe ſix heads, as we have already obſerved, Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam
comprehends all things which fall under our compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; and after having
reaſoned about their nature and origin, in a very philoſophical manner, he
concludes with aſſerting, that five things muſt of neceſſity be
eternal. The firſt of theſe is Pirrum Attima, or the GREAT SOUL, who,
ſays he, is immaterial, one, inviſible, eternal, and indiviſible,
poſſeſſing omniſcience, reſt, will, and power<note n="h" place="bottom">Theſe properties of the divinity, are the following in order;
Nidakaar, Akitta, Oderiſa, Nitte, Apparticta, Budſirba, Suck, Itcha,
Jotna.</note>.</p>
            <p>The ſecond eternal principle is the Jive Attima, or the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul,
which he ſuppoſes is material, by giving it the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing properties;
number, quantity, motion, contraction, extenſion, diviſibility, perception,
pleaſure, pain, deſire, aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, accident, and power. His reaſons for
maintaining, that the <hi>vital ſoul</hi> is different from the <hi>great
ſoul,</hi> are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and it is upon this head that the followers of
the Bedang and Neadirſen are principally divided. The firſt affirm that
there is no ſoul in the univerſe but God, and the ſecond ſtrenuouſly
hold that there is, as they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that God can be ſubject to
ſuch affections and paſſions as they feel in their own minds; or that he
can poſſibly have a propenſity to evil. Evil, according to the author of
the <pb n="lix" facs="tcp:0828000201:68"/> Neadirſen Shaſter, proceeds entirely from Jive
Attima, or the vital ſoul. It is a ſelfiſh craving principle, never to be
ſatisfied; whereas GOD remains in eternal reſt, without any deſire but
benevolence.</p>
            <p>Goutam's third eternal principle is time or duration, which, ſays he,
muſt of neceſſity have exiſted, while any thing did exiſt; and is
therefore infinite. The fourth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is ſpace or extenſion, without
which nothing could have been; and as it comprehends all quantity, or rather is
infinite, he maintains, that it is indiviſible and eternal. The fifth eternal
principle is Akaſh, a ſubtile and pure element, which fills up the vacuum
of ſpace, and is compounded of purmans or quantities, infinitely ſmall,
indiviſible and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual. 
<q rend="inline">"God," ſays he, "can neither make nor annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
theſe atoms, on account of the love which he bears to them, and the
neceſſity of their exiſtence; but they are, in other reſpects, totally
ſubſervient to his pleaſure."</q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"God," ſays Goutam, "at a certain ſeaſon, endued
theſe atoms, as we may call them, with Biſheſh or plaſticity, by virtue
of which they arranged themſelves into four groſs elements, fire, air,
water, and earth. Theſe atoms being, from the beginning, formed by God into
the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, Jive Attima, or the vital ſoul,
aſſociated with them, ſo that animals, and plants of various kinds, were
produced upon the face of the earth."</q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"The ſame vital ſoul," continues Goutam, "which
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſociated with the Purman of an animal, may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
aſſociate with the Purman of a man."</q> This tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration 
<pb n="lx" facs="tcp:0828000201:69"/> is diſtinguiſhed by three names, Mirt, Mirren, and
Pirra-purra-purveſh, which laſt literally ſignifies <hi>the change of
abode.</hi> The ſuperiority of man, according to the philoſophy of the
Neadirſen, conſiſts only in the finer organization of his parts, from
which proceed reaſon, reflexion, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which the brutes only
poſſeſs in an inferior degree, on account of their leſs refined
organs.</p>
            <p>Goutam ſuppoſes, with the author of the Bedang, that the ſoul
after death, aſſumes a body of fire, air, and akaſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the
carnal body, it has been ſo purified by piety and virtue, that it retains no
ſelfiſh inclinations. In that caſe it is abſorbed into the GREAT SOUL
OF NATURE, never more to reanimate fleſh. Such, ſays the philoſopher,
ſhall be the reward of all thoſe who worſhip God from pure love and
admiration, without any ſelfiſh views. Thoſe that ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God
from motives of future happineſs, ſhall be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with their deſires
in heaven, for a certain time. But they muſt alſo expiate their crimes, by
ſuffering adequate puniſhments; and afterwards their ſouls will return to
the earth, and wander about for new habitations. Upon their return to the
earth, they ſhall caſually aſſociate with the firſt organized Purman
they ſhall meet. They ſhall not retain any conſciouſneſs of their
former ſtate, unleſs it is revealed to them by God. But thoſe favoured
perſons are very few, and are diſtinguiſhed by the name of Jates
Summon<note n="i" place="bottom">The acquainted with their former
ſtate.</note>.</p>
            <p>The author of the Neadirſen teaches, for the purpoſes of morality,
that the ſins of the parents will deſcend to their poſterity; and that,
on the other hand, the virtues of the children will mitigate the puniſhments
of the parents in <pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:0828000201:70"/> Nirick, and haſten their return to
the earth. Of all ſins he holds ingratitude<note n="h" place="bottom">Mitterdro.</note> to be the greateſt. Souls guilty of that black
crime, ſays he, will remain in hell, while the ſun remains in heaven, or to
the general diſſolution of all things.</p>
            <p>Intellect, ſays Goutam, is formed by the combined action of the
ſenſes. He reckons ſix ſenſes: five external<note n="i" place="bottom">Onnuman, reaſon. Upimen, perception.</note>, and one internal.
The laſt he calls Manus, by which he ſeems to mean conſcience. In the
latter he comprehends reaſon, perception<note n="k" place="bottom">Chakous,
Shraban, Raſan, Granap, Tawaſs.</note> and memory: and he concludes, that
by their means only, mankind may poſſibly acquire knowledge. He then
proceeds to explain the manner by which theſe ſenſes act.</p>
            <p>Sight, ſays he, ariſes from the Shanſkar or repulſive qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of bodies, by which the particles of light which fall upon them, are reflected
back upon the eyes from all parts of their ſurfaces. Thus the object is
painted in a perfect manner upon the organ of ſeeing, whither the ſoul
repairs to receive the image. He affirms, that, unleſs the ſoul fixes its
attention upon the figure in the eye, nothing can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the mind;
for a man in a profound reverie, though his eyes are open to the light,
perceives nothing. Colours, ſays Coutam, are particular feelings in the eye,
which are proportioned to the quantity of light reflected from any ſolid
body.</p>
            <p>Goutam deſines hearing in the ſame manner with the European
philoſophers, with this difference only, that he <pb n="lxii" facs="tcp:0828000201:71"/>
ſuppoſes, that the ſound which affects the ear, is conveyed through the
purer element of akaſh, and not by the air; an error which is not very
ſurprizing, in a ſpeculative philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher. Taſte, he defines to be a
ſenſation of the tongue and palate, occaſioned by the particular form of
thoſe particles which compoſe food. Smell, ſays he, proceeds from the
effluvia which ariſe from bodies to the noſtrils. The feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which
ariſes from touching, is occaſioned by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of denſe bodies with
the ſkin, which, as well as the whole body, excepting the bones, the hair and
the nails, is the organ of that ſenſe. There runs, ſays he, from all
parts of the ſkin, very ſmall nerves to a great nerve, which he
diſtinguiſhes by the name of Medda. This nerve is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of two
different coats, the one ſenſitive, and the other inſenſitive. It
extends from the crown of the head, down the right ſide of the vertebrae to
the right foot<note n="l" place="bottom">To ſave the credit of Goutam, in this
place, it is neceſſary to obſerve, that anatomy is not at all known among
the Hindoos, being ſtrictly prohibited from touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a dead body, by the
ſevereſt ties of religion.</note>. When the body becomes languid, the
ſoul, fatigued with action, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires within the inſenſible coat, which
checks the operation of the ſenſes, and occaſions ſound ſleep. But
ſhould there remain in the ſoul, a ſmall inclination to action, it
ſtarts into the ſenſitive part of the nerve, and dreams immediately
ariſe before it. Theſe dreams, ſays he, invariably relate to ſomething
perceived before by the ſenſes, though the mind may combine the ideas
together at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Manus, or conſcience, is the internal feeling of the mind, when it is
no way affected by external objects. Onnuman, or reaſon, ſays Goutam, is
that faculty of the ſoul which enables us to conclude that things and
circumſtances exiſt, <pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:0828000201:72"/> from an analogy to things,
which had before fallen under the conception of our bodily ſenſes: For
inſtance, when we ſee ſmoak, we conclude that it proceeds from a fire;
when we ſee one end of a rope, we are perſuaded that it muſt have
another.</p>
            <p>By reaſon, continues Goutam, men perceive the exiſtence of God;
which the Boad or Atheiſts deny, becauſe his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence does not come
within the comprehenſion of the ſenſes. Theſe atheiſts, ſays he,
maintain, that there is no God but the univerſe; that there is neither good
nor evil in the world; that there is no ſuch thing as a ſoul; that all
animals exiſt, by a mere mechaniſm of the organs, or by a fermentation of
the elements; and that all natural produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are but the fortuitous
concourſe of things.</p>
            <p>The philoſopher refutes theſe atheiſtical opinions, by a long
train of arguments, ſuch as have been often urged by European divines. Though
ſuperſtition and cuſtom may biaſs reaſon to different ends, in
various countries, we find a ſurpriſing ſimilarity in the arguments
uſed by all nations, againſt the BOAD, thoſe common enemies of every
ſyſtem of religion.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"Another ſect of the BOAD, ſays Goutam, are of
opinion that all things were produced by chance<note n="m" place="bottom">Addariſto.</note>."</q> This doctrine he thus refutes. Chance is
ſo far from being the origin of all things, that it has but a momentary
exiſtence of its own; being alternately created and annihilated, at periods
infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſmall, as it depends entirely on the action of real 
<pb n="lxiv" facs="tcp:0828000201:73"/> eſſences. This action is not accidental, for it
muſt inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably proceed from ſome natural cauſe. Let the dice be rattled
eternally in the box, they are determined in their motion, by certain
invariable laws. What therefore we call chance, is but an effect proceeding
from cauſes which we do not perceive.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"Perception," continues Goutam, "is that faculty by
which we inſtantaneouſly know things without the help of reaſon. This is
perceived by means of relation, or ſome diſtinguiſhing property in
things, ſuch as high and low, long and ſhort, great and ſmall, hard and
ſoft, cold and hot, black and white."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Memory, according to Goutam, is the elaſticity of the mind, and is
employed in three different ways; on things preſent as to time, but abſent
as to place; on things paſt, and on things to come. It would appear from the
latter part of the diſtinction, that the philoſopher comprehends
imagination in memory. He then proceeds to define all the original properties
of matter, and all the paſſions and faculties of the mind. He then
deſcants on the nature of generation.</p>
            <p> 
               <q rend="inline">"Generation, ſays he, may be divided into two kinds;
Jonidge, or generation by copulation; and adjonidge, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration without
copulation. All animals are produced by the firſt, and all plants by the
latter. The purman or ſeed of things, was formed from the beginning, with all
its parts. When it happens to be depoſited in a matrix ſuitable to its
nature, a ſoul aſſociates with it; and, by aſſimulating 
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:0828000201:74"/> more matter, it gradually becomes a creature or plant;
for plants, as well as animals, are poſſeſſed of a portion of the
<hi>vital ſoul</hi> of the world."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Goutam, in another place, treats diffuſely of providence and free
will. He divides the action of man under three heads: The will of God, the
power of man, and caſual or accidental events. In explaining the firſt, he
maintains a particular providence; in the ſecond, the freedom of will in man;
and in the third, the common courſe of things, according to the general laws
of nature. With reſpect to providence, though he cannot deny the
poſſibility of its exiſtence, without diveſting God of his omnipotence,
he ſuppoſes that the deity never exerts that power, but that he remains in
eternal reſt, taking no concern, neither in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs, nor in the
courſe of the operations of nature.</p>
            <p>The author of the Neadirſen maintains, that the world is ſubject to
ſucceſſive diſſolutions and renovations at certain ſtated periods.
He divides theſe diſſolutions into the leſſer and the greater. The
leſſer diſſolution will happen at the end of a revolution of the Jugs.
The world will be then conſumed by fire, and the elements ſhall be jumbled
together, and after a certain ſpace of time, they will again reſume their
former order. When a thouſand of thoſe ſmaller diſſolutions ſhall
have happened, a MAHPER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY or great diſſolution will take place. All the
elements will then be reduced to their original Purmans or atoms, in which
ſtate they ſhall long remain. God will then, from his mere goodneſs and
pleaſure, reſtore Biſheth or plaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. A new creation will ariſe;
and thus things have <pb n="lxvi" facs="tcp:0828000201:75"/> revolved in ſucceſſion, from
the beginning, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to do ſo to eternity.</p>
            <p>Theſe repeated diſſolutions and renovations have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed an
ample field for the inventions of the Brahmins. Many allegorical ſyſtems of
creation are upon that account contained in the Shaſters. It was for this
reaſon, that ſo many different accounts of the coſmogony of the Hindoos
have been promulgated in Europe; ſome travellers adopting one ſyſtem, and
ſome another. Without deviating from the good manners due to thoſe writers,
we may venture to affirm, that their tales, upon this ſubject, are extreamly
puerile, if not abſurd. They took their accounts from any common Brahmin,
with whom they chanced to meet, and never had the curioſity or induſtry to
go to the fountain head.</p>
            <p>In ſome of the renovations of the world, Brimha, or the wiſdom of
God, is repreſented in the form of an infant with his toe in his mouth,
floating on a comala or water flower, or ſometimes upon a leaf of that plant,
upon the watery abyſs. The Brahmins mean no more by this allegory, than that
at that time, the wiſdom and deſigns of God will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as in their
infant ſtate. Brimha floating upon a leaf, ſhews the inſtability of
things at that period. The toe which he ſucks in his mouth, implies that
infinite wiſdom ſubſiſts of itſelf; and the poſition of Brimha's
body, is an emblem of the endleſs circle of eternity.</p>
            <p>We ſee Brimha ſometimes creeping forth from a winding ſhell. This
is an emblem of the untraceable way by which divine wiſdom iſſues ſorth
from the <hi>infinite ocean of</hi> 
               <pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:0828000201:76"/> 
               <hi>God.</hi> He,
at other times, blows up the world with a pipe, which implies, that the earth
is but a bubble of vanity, which the breath of his mouth can deſtroy. Brimha,
in one of the renovations, is repreſented in the form of a ſnake, one end
of which, is upon a tortoiſe which floats upon the vaſt abyſs, and upon
the other, he ſupports the world. The ſnake is the emblem of wiſdom, the
tortoiſe is a ſymbol of ſecurity, which figuratively ſignifies
providence, and the vaſt abyſs is the eternity and infinitude of God.</p>
            <p>What has been already ſaid has, it is hoped, thrown a new light on the
opinions of the Hindoos, upon the ſubject of religion and philoſophical
inquiry. We find that the Brahmins, contrary to the ideas formed of them in the
weſt, invariably believe in the unity, eternity, omniſcience and
omnipotence of God: that the polytheiſm of which they have been accuſed, is
no more than a ſymbolical worſhip of the divine attributes, which they
divide into three principal claſſes. Under the name of BRIMHA, they
worſhip the wiſdom and creative power of God; under the appellation of
BISHEN, his providential and preſerving quality; and under that of SHIBAH,
that attribute which tends to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>This ſyſtem of worſhip, ſay the Brahmins, ariſes from two
opinions. The firſt is, that as God is immaterial, and conſequently
inviſible, it is impoſſible to raiſe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per idea of him, by any
image in the human mind. The ſecond is, that it is neceſſary to ſtrike
the groſs ideas of man, with ſome emblems of God's attributes, otherwiſe,
that all ſenſe of religion will naturally vaniſh from the mind. They, for
this purpoſe, have <pb n="lxviii" facs="tcp:0828000201:77"/> made ſymbolical
repreſentations of the three claſſes of the divine attributes; but they
aver, that they do not believe them to be ſeparate intelligences. BRIMH, or
the ſupreme divinity, has a thouſand names; but the Hindoos would think it
the groſſeſt impiety to repreſent him under any form. 
<q rend="inline">"The human mind, ſay they, may form ſome conception
of his attributes ſeparately, but who can graſp the whole, within the
circle of finite ideas."</q>
            </p>
            <p>That in any age or country, human reaſon was ever ſo depraved as to
worſhip the work of hands, for the creator of the univerſe, we believe to
be an abſolute deception, which aroſe from the vanity of the abettors of
particular ſyſtems of religion. To attentive inquirers into the human mind,
it will appear, that common ſenſe, upon the affairs of religion, is pretty
equally divided among all nations. Revelation and philoſophy have, it is
confeſſed, lopped off ſome of thoſe ſuperſtitious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcences
and abſurdities that naturally ariſe in weak minds, upon a ſubject ſo
myſterious: but it is much to be doubted, whether the want of thoſe
neceſſary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifiers of religion, ever involved any nation in groſs
ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as many ignorant zealots have pretended.</p>
            <p>In India, as well as in many other countries, there are two religious
ſects; the one look up to the divinity, through the medium of reaſon and
philoſophy; while the others receive, as an article of their belief, every
holy legend and allegory which have been tranſmitted down from antiquity.
From a fundamental article in the Hindoo <pb n="lxix" facs="tcp:0828000201:78"/> faith, that God
is <hi>the ſoul of the world,</hi> and is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diffuſed through
all nature, the vulgar revere all the elements, and conſequently every great
natural object, as containing a portion of God; nor is the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the
ſupreme being, eaſily comprehended by weak minds, without falling into this
error. This vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for different objects, has, no doubt, given riſe
among the common Indians, to an idea of ſubaltern intelligences; but the
learned Brahmins, with one voice, deny the exiſtence of inferior divinities;
and, indeed, all their religious books of any antiquity, confirm that
aſſertion.</p>

            <p>Such is the ſtrange ſyſtem of religion which prieſtcraft has
impoſed on the vulgar, ever ready in all climes and ages to take advantage of
ſuperſtitious minds. There is one thing however to be ſaid in favour of
the Hindoo doctrine, that while it teaches the pureſt morals, it is
ſyſtematically formed on philoſophical opnions. Let us therefore no
longer imagine half the world more ignorant than the ſtones which they ſeem
to worſhip, but reſt aſſured, that whatever the external ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of

the age of the world into four grand periods or jugs: the Sat Jug, the Treta
Jug, the Duapur Jug, and the Cal Jug. They believe that when the Cal Jug is
finiſhed, the Sat Jug will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence again, and that thus time will revolve
in eternal ſucceſſion. The Sat Jug is ſaid to have been a period of
fourteen millions and four hundred thouſand years, and it is repreſented as
the age of felicity, in which there was nothing but truth, religion,
happineſs, peace, plenty, and independence; and that the life of man extended
to one hundred thouſand years.</p>
               <p>The Treta Jug is ſaid to contain one million and eighty thouſand
years, in which, it is ſaid, that in the compoſition of mankind, there were
three fourths truth, and one fourth falſehood, and that the age of man
extended to ten thouſand years. The Duapur Jug is ſaid to contain ſeventy
two thouſand years, in which two parts of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of man were
truth, and two parts falſehood, his age extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one thouſand years.
The Cal Jug contains thirty ſix thouſand years, in which period three

and to inſtruct men how to govern the world, he has in the Beda given a canon
of laws, founded upon the principles of juſtice. But as the Bedas are covered
with a veil of darkneſs by the Brahmins, we cannot ſay much more for
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain concerning them. The Hindoos affirm, that Brimha lives for ever, or,
as ſome ſay, one hundred years, in which each day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted at four

hiſtory of the Hindoos.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Specimen of the ancient hiſtory of the
Hindoos.</note>It is recorded in the Mahabarit, that about the middle of the
third period, there was a Raja of the tribe of Kittiri, in the city of
Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinapoor, whoſe name was Birt. He ruled the kingdom of Hindo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,
and his iſſue after him in lineal deſcent for eight generations, in peace
and tranquillity. The ninth in ſucceſſion, whoſe name was Kour, we are
told, founded the city of that name, which is now called Tannaſſar, and is
about 70 crores from Delhi. He was the father of the tribe who are ſtill
called Kours.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ditaraſhter being blind, his brother ſucceeds
to the throne.</note>In the thirteenth generation from Kour, Chitterbourge
reigned, and was eſteemed a great prince. He had two ſons, one named
Ditaraſhter, and the other Pind. But when Ditaraſhter grew up, he became
blind, and therefore his father left the kingdom to his younger ſon, who had
five children; Judiſhter, Brimſein, and Arjun, by one wife, and Nucul and
Sedive, by another woman. But his elder brother Ditaraſhter had ſons one
hundred and one, by a variety of women, among whom one was named Jirjodin,
being the eldeſt of his children by the firſt wife, and another was called
Jutuſh, being his firſt born by a ſecond ſpouſe. In ſhort, when
Pind died, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0828000201:90"/> deſcended by right to the
heirs of his elder brother Ditar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhter, ſo that Jirjodin became king.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Differences between their children.</note>But the
children of Pind regarded Jirjodin as an enemy, and waited an opportunity to
diveſt him of his authority. Ditaraſhter, fearing diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances,
adviſed his ſon to build a palace without the city for the ſons of Pind,
in which for ſome time they conſented to reſide. In the mean time
Jirjodin had privately ordered the workmen who built this palace to fill up
ſeveral vaults with combuſtibles, and hired an old woman to ſet fire to
them, at a proper opportunity. But the plot being diſcovered accidentally by
the ſons of Pind, they themſelves ſet fire to the mine, and burnt the old
woman and her five ſons in the flames, while they privately withdrew into the
wilderneſs, where they remained for ſome time, the king imagining they had
been deſtroyed in the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſons of Pind ſhew themſelves at
Cumpula.</note>The ſons of Pind ventured at length into a certain city called
Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula, where they wedded Diropti, the Raja's daughter, with whom they lived
by turns, for the ſpace of ſeventeen days. In a ſhort time, however, it
was noiſed abroad, that the ſons of Pind were not dead, as was
ſuppoſed, which reaching the ears of the king, he ordered enquiry to be
made, and found that truth was in the report. 
<note place="margin">Are invited to court.</note>Anxious to have them
again in his power, he wrote to them affectionate letters, inviting them to
Hiſtinapoor, to ſhare with him the inheritance of their forefathers. They
were at length prevailed upon by his fair promiſes, returned to court, and
were treated in every reſpect becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their dignity. A part of the kingdom
was allotted for their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, for upon their arrival they became ſo
much beloved by the people and nobility, that the king was afraid to lay
violent hands upon them. Their popularity daily increaſing, and their party
being ſtrengthened by many of the principal nobility, they at length openly
inſiſted upon a diviſion of the empire in their favour, which the king
being in no condition to refuſe, complied with without heſitation.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The feaſt of the period.</note>Some time after
theſe tranſactions Judiſhter gave the feaſt of the period<note n="*" place="bottom">Jog-Rajaſou, ſomewhat ſimilar to the ſecular games among
the Romans.</note>, the manner of which is ſaid to be this: They lighted a
prodigious fire, and threw into it every kind of ſpice, perfume, fruit, and
grain. At this feaſt it was neceſſary that all the Rajas of the earth
ſhould be preſent. Judiſhter, in order to invite the Rajas, ſent his
four brothers to the four quarters of the world, that by the favour of God his
deſign in a ſhort time might be accompliſhed. His bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, according to
his deſire, from Arab, from Agim, from Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſtan, from Habyſh, and other
countries, brought thoſe princes to be preſent at this grand feſtival.
Jirjodin, on obſerving the greatneſs of Judiſhter, burnt with envy at his
fortune, and contrived this ſcheme to deprive his rival of his kingdoms and
wealth.</p>

all his wealth and kingdoms. Jirjodin told him then, that he would give him one
more chance to recover the whole, but that if he again ſhould loſe, he
muſt retire, with all his brothers, for the ſpace of twelve years into
baniſhment, and if during that interval he was to be ſeen in his former
dominions, he was to remain in baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment twelve years more. Judiſhter,
hoping that fortune would not always be unkind, conſented to theſe terms,
but having loſt as before, he was conſtrained by the princes, who were
umpires, to relinquiſh his kingdoms to Jirjodin, and retire into baniſhment
with his brethren from Inderput, his capital city, now known by the name of
Delhi.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Send an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to demand their ſhare

ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that the tread of their feet was not heard; and when the time
of their exile expired, they diſpatched Kiſhen, the ſon of Baſdeo, to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the reſtoration of their kingdoms. Jirjodin, notwithſtanding 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0828000201:92"/> of his promiſe, made a jeſt of the embaſſy, and
turned the ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor with ſcorn from his preſence. The ſons of Pind
finding that they could do nothing without force, began to collect their
friends, of whom they had many; and in a ſhort time they appeared in the
field of Kirket, near the city of Tanaſſar, at the head of a mighty army,
in the beginning of the Cal Jug. Jirjodin advancing with his army, after having
drawn up his troops in array, encouraged the ranks of the valiant. 
<note place="margin">A battle.</note>The ſoldiers on both ſides,
according to the cuſtom of battle, began to work, for death; the conteſt
was renw'd, with dubious advantages, for the ſpace of eighteen days, till at
length, Jirjodin, with moſt of his friends, as the reward of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy,
drank the cup of fate in the field of war.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Incredible number of both armies.</note>The
Hindoos ſay, that in this war, Jirjodin commanded eleven cohin, and the
ſons of Pind ſeven: a cohin, according to their fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous accounts,
conſiſted of twenty-one thouſand eight hundred and ſeventy elephants of
war, an equal number of chariots, ſix thouſand ſix hundred and ten
horſemen, and one hundred and nine thouſand three hundred and fifty foot.
Of all this incredible number, they ſay that only twelve men ſurvived on
both ſides, four on the part of Jirjodin, and eight on the part of
Judiſhter; among the latter was the ambaſſador Kiſhen Baſdeo, who is
eſteem'd a great prophet among the Hindoos. They ſay, that the
aſtrologers gave advice to Raja Kuns, who ruled in the city of Muttra, that
Kiſhen ſhould one day take away his life; upon which he ſought every
opportunity to put Kiſhen to death: but Kiſhen, knowing the deſigns of
his foe, retired to a place called Nind, where he lived with a ſhepherd
eleven years. He ventured at length into the world, and collecting a body of
men together, who were diſſatisfied with the government of Kuns, he made
war upon him and put him to death, ſetting up Ogurſein, the father of Kuns,
in the kingdom; and he himſelf lived afterwards thirty-two years, at the head
of the adminiſtration at Muttra. Raja Jeradſing, from the country of
Barounia, came at <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0828000201:93"/> length with a great army, towards Muttra,
to turn Kiſhen from his place. At the ſame time came from the eaſt, Raja
Callioon, and attacked him on the other ſide. Kiſhen, not able to oppoſe
theſe two Rajas, fled towards Duarka, which is on the coaſt of the Salt
Sea, and was there beſieg'd for the ſpace of eighteen years, where ſome
ſay he died; but the ſuperſtitious aver that he is ſtill alive, and
therefore they pay him divine honors.</p>
               <p>They relate that after the Mahabarit, which ſignifies the great
war, Judiſhter having overcome Jirjodin, ruled the whole empire of
Hindoſtan for thirty-ſix years, when being diſguſted with the vanity
and pomp of the world, he retired into a mountain, dividing his wealth and
empire among his friends, and lived the life of religion and poverty the
remainder of his days. The reign of Jirjodin and Judiſhter is ſaid to be
one hundred and twenty-five years. Such are the tales of the Hindoos concerning
an age too dark and diſtant to be diſtinctly known.</p>

and then marched his army towards Malava, which he conquered, and putting it in
the hands of his Vizier, ordered many cities and towns to be built in that
province. Having repaired the fort of Narvar, he appointed one of his kinſmen
governor, and demanded the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Raja of Bijanagur in marriage, who,

               <p>Ramdeo afterwards went unto the mountains of Sawalic, and reduced

anceſtors, according to the fabulous hiſtory of the Hindoos, had reigned
there ten thouſand years. This Raja had drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a powerful army, with

plundering the country, till he reached Scutdimmindi. There he halted out of

offerings, then retiring, demanded the daughter of the Raja in marriage for his

ſecret, That the firſt perſon of the faith who placed his foot within the
boundaries of Hindoſtan, was Mohlib, the ſon of Abiul Sukur. The
particulars of his hiſtory are theſe: In the twenty-eighth year of the
Higerah, Abdulla, the ſon of Amir, governor of Buſſorah, by the command
of Oſman, led an army towards Pharis, againſt the ſovereign of that
kingdom, who had revolted upon the death of Omar. Abdulla reduced his enemy to
obedience, and returned vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to Buſſorah. In the thirtieth of the
Higerah, Oſman turned Olid Okbah, on account of his continuing to drink wine,
from the government of Kuſa, which he conferred upon Seid ben ul Aſs. That
commander marched the ſame year towards Tibiriſtan, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the two
ſons of Ali, Haſſen and Haſſein, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the country of Jirju,
whoſe capital is Aſhtrabad, where he raiſed a contribution of forty
thouſand dinars. Abdulla ben Amir, ruler of Buſſorah, on the part of
Oſman, in the thirty-firſt of the Higerah, marched to the conqueſt of
Chorraſan, by the way of <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0828000201:121"/> Kirman, and having reduced
that country, Seiſtan, Keiſtan, Neſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poor, Sirchuſh, Herat,
Badyeiſh, Ghore, Girghiſtan, Murve, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickan and Balich, he entered into a
treaty with a King of the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern regions whoſe name was Joos; having
appointed Keis ben Hanim to the government of Chorraſan, Hanif ben Keis to
the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency of Murve, Talickan and Neſhapoor, and Chalid ben
Abdulla to that of Herat, Ghore and Gerghiſtan, he himſelf being bent on a
pilgrimage to Caba, marched back by the way of Hujage.</p>
               <p>In the thirty-third year, Abdul Reiman, by order of Oſman, having
marched with an army againſt Balich, he and all his troops became martyrs to
the faith, except a few, who eſcaped the ſword and fled by the way of
Gilan. Sharon, who was an Omrah of Agim, ſeeing that Abdulla ben Amir had
gone a pilgrimage to Mecca, and that the plains of Chorraſan were clear of
Perſians and Muſſulmen, raiſed in the ſame year an army of forty
thouſand men from Jibbis, Herat, Badyeiſh, Ghore, Keiſtan, and the
adjacent countries, and fell upon the Muſſulmen. But Abdulla Hazim, who was
at Neſhapoor with Hanif, with four thouſand horſe, attacked and defeated
him; for which ſervice he was afterwards rewarded with the government of
Chorraſan.</p>
               <p>In the forty-fourth year of the Higerah, Mavia ben Abeſſifian
advanced Zeiad ben Abiera to the government of Buſſorah, Chorra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan and
Seiſtan; and in that year, Abdul Reiman ben Summera, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the orders
of Zeiad, conquered the country of Cabul, and bound them over to obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mohlib</note>About the ſame time, Mohlib ben
abul Sukur, who was a great Omrah of Arab, by the way of Murve, invaded Cabul
and Zabul; 
<note place="margin">enters Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan.</note>then entering
Hindoſtan, made war upon the idolators, ravaging <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0828000201:122"/> the
country of Limgan and its dependencies, and with twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand captives
returned to Chorraſan. A few of the inhabitants of Hind were converted at
that time to the belief of the unity of God, and the embaſſy of his holy
prophet.</p>
               <p>In the fifty-third of the Higerah, Zuad, governor of Buſſorah,
died in conſequence of a wound in his finger, and Mavia gave the government
of Kufa to Abdulla his ſon. Abdulla led his troops againſt the country of
Maver ul neer, which he conquered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Kufa; after which he got
the government of Buſſorah, and appointed Aſlim ben Zerait ul Gulabi to
the government of Chorraſan: But in the year fifty-ſix, Mavia gave that
appointment to Seid ben Oſman Affan; and again, in the year fifty-nine, that
government was changed into the hands of Abdul Reiman ben Zeiad.</p>
               <p>In the ſixty-ſecond of the Higerah, Zeid ben Mavia appointed
Zillim ben Ziad to rule over Chorraſan and Seiſtan. Among the chiefs who
attended him, was Mohlib ben Abiull Sukur: This Zillim, when he had ſeated
himſelf in the government, gave his brother Izid the government of Seiſtan,
who hearing that the King of Cabul had impriſoned Abu Abida his brother, who
had been col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the tribute, he raiſed an army and marched towards him,
but after an obſtinate battle he was defeated, and loſt the greateſt part
of his army.</p>
               <p>Intelligence of this defeat coming to Zillim, he ſent Tilla ben
Abudulla to Cabul, who ranſomed Abu-Abida for five thouſand dirms. He then
ſet aſide his brother, and gave the government of Seiſtan to Tilla, who
ſent the troops of Ghore and Badyeiſh to Cabul, and by that means reduced
that country to obedience, and conferred the government upon Chaled ben
Abdulla. This Chaled <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0828000201:123"/> ben Abdulla being ordered ſome
time thereafter to return back and give an account of his adminiſtration,
fearing the oppreſſion of new rulers, with his family, wealth and friends,
fled to the mountains of Soliman, which extend between Moultan and Peſhawir,
and there took up his abode. He married his daughter to one of the chiefs of
the Afghans, who was a Muſſulman: From this marriage ſprung many
children, two of whom became famous, Load and Soor; from whom the two great
tribes of that name derive their origin. 
<note place="margin">Origin of the Afgans.</note>In the hiſtory of

that the Afghans are of the race of the Cibthi<note n="*" place="bottom">Copts or

hoſpitably entertained.</p>
               <p>In the one hundred and forty-third of the Higerah, when they began

               <p>A war broke out at that time, between the Raja of Lahore and the
tribe of Gicker, who entered into an alliance with the Afgans or Patans, which
obliged the Raja to accommodate matters, and give up ſeveral diſtricts to
the Patans. The tribe of Chillige entered in the mean time into treaty with
them, in which the Patans guarantied the boundaries of Hindoſtan againſt
any foreign invaſion by the way of Iran. To be able to fulfil the terms of
this treaty, they built the fort of Cheiber in the paſſes of the mountains,
which obliged the troops of Samania to invade Hind, by the way of Sind and

chief of that place priſoner, added his territory to his own dominions,
giving the government of it to Actaſs. He ſoon after reſolved upon a war
with the idolators of Hindoſtan, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of the year three
hundred and ſixty-ſeven, which was the firſt of his reign, he undertook
that expedition; and having ravaged part of the countries of Cabul and Punjaab,
he founded ſome moſques, and returned to Ghizni with great treaſures.</p>
               <p>Jeipal, the ſon of Hitpal the Brahmin, ruled at this time, the
country extending from Sirhind to Limghaan, and from Caſhmire to Moultan; and
kept his court at Lahore. 
<note place="margin">Advances againſt Jeipal.</note>Jeipal finding he
could have no reſt from the incurſions of the Muſſulmen, raiſed a
great army with intent to invade them in their own country, which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uctagi
hearing, put his army in motion, and marched out to meet him. The Kings drew
near one another at Limghaan, on the boundaries of their reſpective
dominions: They ſkirmiſhed for a few days, and Sultan Mamood, though then a
boy, gave ſuch ſignal proofs of his courage, that he drew tears of joy from
the eyes of his father.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A miraculous ſtorm,</note>Hiſtorians, whoſe
credulity exceed their wiſdom, have told us, that on this occaſion, a

there was a ſpring, into which, if a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a certain drug,
called Caſurat, ſhould be thrown, the ſky would immediately be
overcaſt, and a dreadful ſtorm of hail and wind ariſe. Subuctagi having
accordingly ordered this to be done, the effects became viſible, for
immediately the ſky loured, and thunder, lightning, wind and hail began,
turning the day into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſpreading horror and deſolation
around; inſomuch that a great part of the cavalry were killed, and ſome
thouſands of both armies periſhed; but the troops of Ghizni being more
hardy than thoſe of Hindoſtan, ſuffered not ſo much upon this
occaſion. 
<note place="margin">which induces Jeipal to ſue for
peace.</note>Jeipal in the morning found his army in ſuch weakneſs and
dejection, by the effects of this ſtorm, which was rather natural than the
work of magic, that fearing Subuctagi would take advantage of his condition, he
ſent Heralds to treat of a peace: He offered to the King of Ghizni a certain
tribute, and a conſiderable preſent in elephants and gold.</p>
               <p>Subuctagi was not diſpleaſed with theſe terms, but his ſon,
Sultan Mamood, who was an ambitious young man, fearing this would put an end to
his expedition, prevailed with his father to reject the propoſal. Jeipal,
upon this, told him that the cuſtoms of the Raja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puts were of ſuch a
nature, that if he perſiſted in diſtreſſing them, it muſt make him,
in the end, pay very dear for his victories. Upon ſuch occaſions, and when
reduced to extremity, ſaid Jeipal, they murder their wives and children,
ſet fire to their houſes, ſet looſe their hair, and, ruſhing in
deſpair among the enemy, drown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the crimſon torrent of
revenge. Subuctagi hearing of this cuſtom, he was afraid to reduce them to
deſpair, and conſented to let them retreat upon their paying a million of
Dirms, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him with fifty elephants. Jeipal not being able to
diſcharge the whole of this ſum in camp, he deſired that ſome perſons

Subuctagi, ſhould accompany him to Lahore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ballance; for

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His perfidy.</note>Jeipal having arrived at
Lahore, and finding Subuctagi had returned home, impriſoned his
meſſengers, and refuſed to pay the money. It was then cuſtomary among
the Rajas, in affairs of moment, to aſſemble the double council, which
conſiſted of an equal number of the moſt reſpectable Brahmins, who
ſat on the right ſide of the throne; and of the nobleſt Kittries, who
ſat on the left. When they ſaw that Jeipal proceeded to ſuch an impolitic
meaſure, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the King, ſaying, that the conſequence of this
ſtep would bring ruin and diſtreſs upon the country; the troops ſaid
they have not yet forgot the terror of their enemy's arms; and Jeipal may
reſt aſſured, that a conqueror will never brook ſuch an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: It
was, therefore, the opinion of the double council, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſtrictly with
the terms of the peace, that the people might enjoy the bleſſings of
tranquillity; but the King was obſtinate, and would not hearken to their
advice.</p>
               <p>Intelligence of what was done, ſoon reached the ears of Subuctagi;
like a foaming torrent he haſtened towards Hindoſtan with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous army,
to take revenge upon Jeipal for his treacherous behaviour; 
<note place="margin">Renews the war,</note>Jeipal alſo collected his
forces, and marched forth to meet him; for the neighbouring Rajas,
conſidering themſelves intereſted in his ſucceſs, ſupplied him with
troops and money. The Rajas of Delhi, Aj<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere, Callinger and Kinnoge, were now
bound in his alliance, and Jeipal found himſelf at the head of an army of a
hundred thouſand horſe, and two hundred thouſand foot; with which he
marched with full aſſurance of victory.</p>

and in number, like the ants or the locuſts; but he looked upon himſelf as
a wolf among a flock of goats: Calling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore together his chiefs, he
encouraged them to glory, and honoured them diſtinctly with his commands. His
troops, though few in number, he divided into ſquadrons of five hundred each,
which he ordered one after another, to the attack in a circle, ſo that a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual round of freſh troops harraſſed the Indian army.</p>
               <p>

mounted than the cavalry of Subuctagi, could effect nothing againſt them;
ſo that wearied out with this manner of fighting, confuſion became
viſible amongſt them. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uctagi perceiving their diſorder, ſounded a
general charge, ſo that they fell like corn before the hands of the reaper;
and were purſued with great ſlaughter to the banks of the river Nilaab;
where many, who had eſcaped the edge of the ſword, periſhed by their fear
in the waters.</p>
               <p>Subuctagi acquired in this action much glory and wealth; for
beſides the rich plunder of the Hindoo camp, he raiſed great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
in the countries of Limghaan and Peſhawir, and annexed them to his own
dominions, joined them to his titles, and ſtamped their names, as was
cuſtomary, upon his coins. One of his Omrahs, with three thouſand horſe,
was appointed to the government of Peſhawir; and the Afghans who reſided
among the mountains, having promiſed allegiance, he entertained ſome
thouſands of them in his army, and returned victorious to Ghizni.</p>

young King perceiving, prevented him by diſmounting and receiving him in his
embrace. At this happy interview the flower of joy bloomed in every face, and
ſuch a knot of friendſhip was bound as can hardly be paralleled in any
age.</p>
               <p>As the ſeaſon was now too far advanced for action, it was agreed
that Subuctagi ſhould return, during the winter, to Ghizni, and prepare his
forces to act in conjunction with thoſe of Amir Noo in the ſpring. But when
Amir Ali Sumjure, prince of Choraſſan, at whoſe court Faek was then in
treaty, heard of the alliance formed between Amir Noo and Subuctagi, he began
to fear the conſequence of his engagement with Faeck. He aſked his council
where he ſhould take protection, in caſe fortune, which was ſeldom to be

ſituation of affairs required he ſhould endeavour to gain the alliance of
Fuchier ul Dowla, prince of Jirja. Jaffier zul Karmin was accordingly appointed
ambaſſador to the court of Jirja, with preſents of every thing that was
valuable and curious: and in a ſhort time a treaty of friendſhip and

opened the treaſury and diſtributed the greateſt part of his father's

by Abu Niſir Muſcati, and of the famous Abul Fazil, that no King had ever
more learned men at his court, kept a finer army, or diſplayed more
magnificence than Sultan Mamood. All theſe things could not be done without
expence; ſo that the ſtigma of avarice muſt have been owing to two
particular circumſtances of his life, which ought by no means to have
ſtamped his general character with that ſordid vice.</p>
               <p>The two circumſtances in a few words were theſe. Having a great
propenſity to poetry, in which he made ſome tolerable progreſs himſelf,
he promiſed Sheck Phirdoci a golden mher<note n="*" place="bottom">A mher is

deſirous to patronize. Under the protection of this promiſe, that divine
poet wrote the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleled poem called the Shaw Namma, which conſiſted of
ſixty thouſand couplets. When he preſented it to the King, he repented of
his promiſe, telling the poet, that he thought ſixty thouſand rupees
might ſatisfy him for a work which he ſeemed to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with ſo
much eaſe and expedition. Phirdoci juſtly offended at this indignity, could
never be brought to accept of any reward, though Sultan Mamood would after
reflection have gladly paid him the ſum originally ſtipulated; the poet,
however, took ample revenge in a ſatire of ſeven hundred couplets which he
wrote upon that occaſion.</p>

expreſſed in the heroſcope of his fate. Subuctagi being aſleep at the

his chimney, which threw its ſhadow over the face of the earth, and
ſcreened from the ſtorms of heaven the whole animal creation.

had not been paid in the year three hundred ninety-five, he directed his march
towards the city of Battea; and leaving the boundaries of Moultan, arrived at
Tahera, which was fortified with an exceeding high wall, and a deep broad

Ugeïn, Gualiar, Callinger, Kinnoge, Delhi and Ajmere, entered into a
confederacy, and collecting their forces, advanced towards Punjaab with the
greateſt army that had been for ſome hundreds of years ſeen upon the
plains of Hindoſtan. The two armies came in ſight of one another in a great
plain near Piſhawir. They remained there encamped forty days without action:
but the troops of the idolaters daily increaſed in number. They were joined
by the Gickers and other tribes with numerous armies, and ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the
Muſſulmen, who fearing a general aſſault were obliged to entrench

purſued the runaways within the trenches, where a dreadful ſcene of
ſlaughter enſued on both ſides, in which five thouſand Muſſulmen in
a few minutes drank the wine of martyrdom. The enemy at length being ſlain as

ſtruck the Hindoos with a panic, for thinking they were deſerted by their

down their idols and ſubverting their temples. There was at that time in the
territory of Nagracut a famous fort called Bimé, which the Sultan
inveſted, after having deſtroyed the country round with fire and ſword.
Bimé was built by Raja Bimé on the top of a ſteep mountain, and
here the Hindoos, on account of its ſtrength, had repoſited the wealth
conſecrated to their idols in all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring kingdoms; ſo that in
this fort there was a greater quantity of gold, ſilver, precious ſtones and

<note place="margin">Mamood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts Bimé.</note>The Sultan
inveſted the place with ſuch expedition that the Hindoos had not time to

moſt part of prieſts, a race of men who having little inclination to the

capitulate. 
<note place="margin">Bimé taken.</note>Their requeſt being
granted by Mamood, they opened the gates, and fell upon their faces before him;
and with a few of his officers and attendants, he immediately entered the

maunds of pure gold in ingots, two thouſand maunds of ſilver bullion, and
twenty maunds of various jewels ſet, which had been collecting from the time
of Bimé. With this immenſe treaſure the King returned to Ghizni, and
in the year 400 prepared a magnificent feſtival, where he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played to the
people his wealth in golden thrones, and in other rich ornaments, in a great
plain without the city of Ghizni, and after the feaſt every individual
received a princely preſent.</p>

done to valour on both ſides. The Sultan finding that the troops of Ghor

his army to make a feint of retreating, to allure the enemy out of their
fortified camp, which accordingly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.

deceived, purſued the army of Ghizni to the plain, where the Sultan facing
round with his troops, attacked them with great impetuoſity and ſlaughter.
Mahummud Suri was taken priſoner and brought to the King, but in his
deſpair he had taken poiſon, which he always kept under his ring, and died
in a few hours. His country was annexed to the dominions of Ghizni.</p>
               <p>Some hiſtorians affirm, that neither the ſovereigns of Ghor, nor
its inhabitants were Muſſulmen, till after this victory, whilſt others of

               <p>Mamood in the ſame year was under the neceſſity of marching
again into Moultan, which had revolted, but having ſoon reduced it, and cut
off a great number of the chiefs, he brought Daood ben Nazir priſoner to

It had reached the ears of the King, that Tannaſar was held in the ſame

ſet up a whole tribe of rich idols, the principal of whom they called Jug
Soom; that this Jug Soom they pretended to ſay exiſted when as yet the
world exiſted not. When the Sultan reached the country of Punjaab, he wanted
that according to the treaty that ſubſiſted between him and Annindpal, he

               <p>Annindpal agreed to this propoſal, and prepared an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Mamood at this time wrote to Calipha Abaſſi al Kadir Billa, that the

Sultan, in the year 404, drew his army againſt the fort of Nindoona, which is
ſituated upon the mountains of Belnat, and was in the poſſeſſion of
the Raja of Lahore. Annindpal by this time was dead, and his ſon had acceded
to his government. When Pitterugepal, for that was the new Raja's name, ſaw
that he could not ſtand againſt the Sultan in the field, he drew off his
army towards Caſhmire, leaving a good garriſon for the defence of the
place. The Sultan immediately inveſted it, and with mining and other arts of
attack, aſſiduouſly employed himſelf; ſo that in a few weeks the
governor ſeeing his walls in ruins was under the neceſſity of begging to
capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate. The Sultan granted his requeſt, took every thing of value out of
the place, appointed a governor, and ſet out without delay for Caſhmire,
upon which Pitterugepal abandoned that province and fled to the hills. The
Sultan plundered the country, in which he found great wealth, and having forced
the inhabitants to acknowledge the prophet, returned with the ſpoil to his

with an army to Caſhmire, to puniſh the revolted chiefs, and to beſiege
ſome forts which he had not reduced in his former expedition. The firſt of
thoſe forts was Lokote, very famous for its heighth and ſtrength, which
entirely defeated the Sultan's utmoſt efforts; for not being able to reduce
it, all the ſummer ſeaſon, he was obliged, on the approach of winter, to
abandon his enterprize, and return to Ghizni. On his way home he was led

Mahummud Taï to advance before him with a detachment. When the
Muſſulmen were at prayers in their camp, Himar Taſh, the general of the
Charizmians, ruſhed upon this detachment from a neighbouring wood, and making
a great ſlaughter, put them to flight. The Sultan having received
intelligence of this affair, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them with ſeveral ſquadrons of

Ghizni three months march, and ſeven great rivers ruſhed acroſs the way.
When Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mood reached the confines of Caſhmire, the Raja ſent him preſents

miſkal; and the image being melted down, produced ninety-eight thouſand
three hundred miſkal of pure gold. Beſides theſe, there were above a

Sultan, having tarried here twenty days, in which time the city ſuffered
greatly from fire, beſides what it ſuffered from the hand of ravage and
deſolation, he marched againſt the other fortified places in theſe

peace, and a great ſum of money for this animal. But the obſtinacy of
Jundroy would never liſten to any terms with the Muſſulmen, ſo that
Mamood, with regret, was obliged to deſiſt. The elephant however happened
one night to break looſe from his keepers, and went into the Sultan's camp,

ſhort ſpace of time the capital was ornamented, with moſques, porches,
fountains, reſervoirs, aqueducts and ciſterns, in a degree ſuperior to
any city at that time in the eaſt. Some authors affirm, that among the
curioſities which the Sultan poſſeſſed, there was a bird, of the
ſize of a cuckoo, which was poſſeſſed of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtinct
or quality, that whenever poiſon was brought, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſecretly, into the
apartment in which he hung, he was affected with the ſmell in ſuch a
manner, as to fly diſtractedly about his cage, while the tears ſtreamed
involuntarily from his eyes. This bird, with other curioſities, was ſent as
a preſent to the Caliph of Bagdat, Al Kadir Billa Abaſſi. We, however,
believe, that this ſtory roſe from the policy of Mamood, and the credulity
of mankind, rather than that it had actually any foundation in truth. Other
authors mention a ſtone which he brought from Hindoſtan, as a great
curioſity. This ſtone being dipped in water, and applied to a wound, proved
a powerful and efficacious remedy.</p>

from the walls of Sumnat, that therefore it could ſerve no purpoſe to
deſtroy the image, but that ſuch a ſum of money, given in charity among
believers, would be a very meritorious action. The Sultan acknowleged, that

Byram Deo, after the taking of Sumnat, had fled from Narwalla the capital of

               <p>It's ſaid, that Sultan Mamood, upon hearing that a citizen of
Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapoor was poſſeſſed of immenſe wealth, commanded him to be
called into his preſence. The King began to reproach him for being an
idolater and an apoſtate from the faith. The citizen replied, 
<q rend="inline">"O King, I am no idolater nor apoſtate, but it is
true that I am poſſeſſed of much wealth; take it therefore, but do me
not a double injuſtice, by robbing me of my money and my good name."</q> The
King, for this inſolence, as he termed it; ordered him to be puniſhed and
confiſcated his whole eſtate.</p>

other inſtances, famous for juſtice. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon one day, thruſting
himſelf into the preſence, called loudly for juſtice. The King ordered
him to explain his complaint, which he thus did: That, unfortunately having a
handſome wife, the King's nephew had conceived a paſſion for her, and
came to his houſe every night with armed attendants, beating him and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him into the ſtreet till he had gratified his adulterous paſſion. That he
had frequently complained to thoſe who ought to have done him juſtice, but
that the rank of the adulterer had ſhut their ears againſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of his juſtice.</note>The King, upon hearing
this, was ſo much enraged that tears of reſentment and compaſſion
ſtarted from his eyes; he repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the poor man for not making ſooner
his complaint to him. The man replied, that he often attempted it, but could
not gain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance. He was then commanded by the King, to return to his
houſe, and to give him notice the firſt time that his nephew was guilty of
the like violence; charging thoſe who were preſent, upon pain of death, to
let nothing of this complaint tranſpire, ordering him to be admitted at any
hour. Accordingly the man returned to his houſe, and upon the third night
following, the King's nephew, as uſual, came, and having whipped the
huſband ſeverely, turned him into the ſtreet. The poor man haſtened to
the King; but the captain of the guards would not give him admittance,
ſaying, that his Majeſty was in the Haram. The man immediately began to
make a violent outery, ſo that the porter fearing that the court might be
diſturbed, and that the noiſe might reach the King, he was under the
neceſſity to conduct him to the Eunuchs of the bedchamber, who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
acquainted the Sultan with the affair.</p>
               <p>The King immediately roſe, and drawing on a garment followed the
man to his houſe. He found his nephew and the man's wife <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0828000201:182"/>

in one bed, with a candle ſtanding on the carpet near them. The Sultan,
extinguiſhing the candle, drew his dagger and ſevered his nephew's head
from his body: Then commanding the man to light the candle, he called out for
ſome water, and having taken a deep draught, he told him he might now go and
ſleep with ſafety, if he could truſt his own wife.</p>
               <p>The poor man fell down at the Sultan's feet, in gratitude to his
juſtice and condeſcenſion, but begged he might tell him why he put out
the candle, and afterwards called out ſo vehemently for water. The King
replied, that he put out the candle that pity might not arreſt his hand in
the execution of juſtice, on a youth whom he tenderly loved; and that he had
made a vow to God, when he firſt heard his complaint, that he would neither
eat nor drink till he had brought the criminal to juſtice, in ſo much, that
he was upon the point of dying of thirſt.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The learned men who flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed under

principally theſe; Ozaeri Raſi, a native of Rai, whoſe poetical
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances as a panegyriſt, are eſteemed very good, for one of which he
received a preſent of 4000 Dirms from the Sultan.—Aſſidi Tooſi, a
native of Chorraſſan, a poet of great ſame, whom the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan often
entreated to undertake the Shaw Namma, but he excuſed himſelf on account of
his age. He was the maſter of Phirdoci, who afterwards undertook that work;
but Phirdoci falling ſick by too much application, before it was finiſhed,
he applied himſelf to his old maſter Aſſidi; telling him that he was
now at the point of death, and that his only regret for leaving this vain world
was, that his poem was unfiniſhed. The old man weeping replied, that, tho' he
had often excuſed himſelf to the King, from having any hand in that
performance, yet for the affection he bore to Phirdoci, he would undertake to
finiſh his poem. The dying poet replied, that he was <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0828000201:183"/>

was afraid, years and infirmities had damped the native fire of Aſſidi.</p>
               <p>The old man warmed with friendſhip and emulation, collecting the
force of his mind, made the attempt, and brought into the chains of rhime in a
few days, that part of the poem, between the Arabian conqueſt of Agim to the
end, which conſiſts of four thouſand couplets. He immediately brought it
to Phirdoci, who was ſo rejoiced that he recovered from his diſorder. The
Shaw Namma is eſteemed among the firſt of poetical productions, and
Phirdoci the author, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently among the firſt of poets.</p>
               <p>Minuchere was an Omrah of Balich, and famous for his poetry and wit.
But Hakim Ali Unſuri is eſteemed to hold the firſt rank, as to genius, in
that age; for beſides being one of the beſt poets, he was a great
philoſopher, verſed in all the known ſciences, and all the learned
languages of thoſe times. Four hundred poets and learned men, beſides all
the ſtudents of the univerſity of Ghizni, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him for their
maſter. He was therefore appointed by the King, to ſuperintend literature,
and it was ordered, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance ſhould be brought before the Sultan,
without being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly honoured with the approbation of Ali Unſuri.</p>
               <p>Among the works of Unſuri there is an heroic poem, upon the
actions of Sultan Mamood. The King having one night, in his cups, cut off the
long treſſes of his beloved<note n="*" place="bottom">His favourite
miſtreſs.</note>, he was much afflicted in the morning for what he had
done. He ſat, he roſe, he walked by turns, and there was a terror round
him, which kept the people at diſtance. <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0828000201:184"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1028. Higer. 419.</note>Ali Unſuri
accoſted him with ſome extempore lines<note n="†" place="bottom">The
beauty of the lines conſiſted chiefly in a happy chime of words, which
cannot poſſibly be imitated in a tranſlation. The ſenſe runs thus: On
this happy day, when the treſſes of your beloved are cut off, what place is
there for grief? Let it be rather crowned with mirth and wine, for the beauty
of the cypreſs is increaſed by the pruning of it's branches.</note>, which
ſo pleaſed the King that he ordered his mouth to be filled three times with
jewels. Calling then for wine, he ſat down with the poet and waſhed down
his grief, ſeaſoning ſociety with wit.</p>
               <p>Asjuddi was one of the ſcholars of Unſuri: He was a native of
Hirvi, a poet bleſſed with the light of true genius, but his works are very
ſcarce and the greateſt part of them loſt. Firochi was alſo a pupil of
Unſuri. He was of the antient royal race of the Kings of Seiſtan, but
reduced by fortune ſo low, that he was obliged to hire himſelf to a farmer
for the yearly wages of a hundred Dirms. When he married, he found this ſmall
ſum would not anſwer his expences, ſo he became deſirous of having his
wages increaſed. The farmer told him he certainly deſerved a great deal
more, but that his capacity could not extend the allowance further. Firochi, in
this ſtate of dependence, waited on the Sultan's nephew Abul Muziffir with a
poem, for which he was honoured with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome reward, with a horſe and a
dreſs. He was introduced to the King by Muziffir, who ſettled a penſion
upon him which enabled him to ride with a retinue of twenty well mounted
ſlaves.</p>

becauſe they had, for two years, gained an aſcendancy over the inhabitants
of Chorraſſan, and were daily gaining ſtrength. The Sultan, at that time,

Rahim, the ſon of Mahummud, whom Modood pardoned for this reaſon; that
during the time that Muſaood was priſoner, Abdul Rahim went with his
brother Abdul Reiman to ſee him. When, upon this occaſion, the latter
inſultingly threw off Muſaood's royal cap, Abdul Rahim took it up and put
it upon the King's head with much reſpect, chaſtiſing his brother for his
mean and barbarous behaviour.</p>
               <p>Modood having thus revenged his father's murder, built a town on the
ſpot upon which he had obtained the victory, and called it Fatte Abad. He
carried the remains of his father and family, to be interred at Ghizni; whither
he returned, and appointed Abu Niſer Ahmed his Vizier. But he ſoon after
diſcharged that Omrah from that high office, and conferred the dignity upon
Chuja Tahir. He ſent, at the ſame time, Niſir Ahmed with a force to
Moultan, againſt Nami, the ſon of Mahummud, whom he ſlew, reducing the
country under the obedience of Modood. The Sultan had now nothing to fear but

ſuperſtitious, by which means the Raja was joined by zealots from all
parts, and ſoon ſaw himſelf at the head of a very numerous army. With
this army, as we have already mentioned, he beſieged Nagracot, and when the

of the ſame ſhape and ſize with the former, which he had cauſed to be

rejoicing among his deluded votaries, who exclaimed, that their God was
returned from Ghizni. The Raja, and the Brahmins, taking advantage of the

the temple, where he received the worſhip and congratulations of his

               <p>This ſtory raiſed ſo much the ſame of the idol, that
thouſands came daily to worſhip from all parts of Hindoſtan, as alſo to

Feroch Zaad became the inhabitant of another world, Sultan Ibrahim aſcended
the throne of empire: A King remarkable for morality and devotion, having in
the flower of his youth, amidſt a paradiſe of pleaſure, conquered all the
ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and added two months more to the feaſt of Ramzan,
which he kept with the ſtricteſt ſeverity. He, at the ſame time, gave
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per attention to government, and the due adminiſtration of juſtice, and
opened the hand of charity to the poor. This prince excelled in the art of fine
writing, and in the libraries of Mecca and Medina, there are two copies of the
Koran wrote by his own hand, which were ſent as preſents to the
Caliph.—<note place="margin">Peace with the Turkumans.</note>In the firſt

they had ſeized, upon condition that they would not lengthen the hand of
violence any further upon his dominions. He married, at the ſame time, his
ſon Muſaood, to the daughter of their King, Malleck Shaw, which opened the
door of friendſhip and intercourſe between the two nations.</p>
               <p>We are told, that before this peace was concluded, Malleck Shaw had
collected a great army, with an intention to invade Ghizni, which greatly
intimidated Ibrahim, as he was not then in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to oppoſe him. 
<note place="margin">Policy of Ibrahim.</note>But knowing that policy
is ſometimes a good ſubſtitute for ſtrength, he wrote letters to the
principal Omrahs of Malleck Shaw's army, which he diſpatched by a
meſſenger who had received his inſtructions how to proceed. The purport
of thoſe letters was to importune the Omrahs, to whom they were directed, to
haſten the King's march to Ghizni, leſt their ſcheme ſhould be
prematurely diſcovered; and that they might depend upon his fulfilling his
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to their ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">King of the Turkomans deceived.</note>The
meſſenger accordingly took an opportunity one day, when Malleck Shaw was
hunting, upon the road to Ghizni, to come running towards him; but upon
diſcovering the King, he ſtole ſlowly away, which creating ſuſpicion,
he was purſued by ſome horſemen, and brought before the King. He was
immediately ſearched, and the pacquet was found upon him; though he had
previouſly ſuffered himſelf to be ſeverely baſtinadoed, without
confeſſing any thing. The King having read theſe letters, the power of
the ſuppoſed conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors was ſuch, that there was great danger in
accuſing them; but it raiſed ſuch a diffidence in his mind, that he, from
that time, was deſirous of peace, and gave over all thoughts of his
expedition.</p>
               <p>When the mind of Ibrahim was quieted from any apprehenſions from
that quarter, he ſent an army towards Hindoſtan, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered

<note place="margin">Ibrahim's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to Hindoſtan.</note>In the
year 472, he marched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf towards that country, and extended his
conqueſts to the fort of Ajodin, called now Palanſhukurgunge. This place
being taken, he turned to another fort called Rupal, which was built upon the
ſummit of a ſteep hill; a river encloſed it on three ſides, and a
ſmall peninſula joined it to the other hills, which were entirely covered
with an impervious wood, and much infeſted by venemous ſerpents. This,
however, did not diſcourage the Sultan from his attempt. He ordered ſome
thouſand hatchet men to clear the wood, which they effected in ſpite of all
oppoſition; and the rock being ſoft, the miners forced their way in a
ſhort time under the walls, which were brought down in ruins. 
<note place="margin">Takes Rupal.</note>The place was immediately
taken, and the garriſon made priſoners.</p>
               <p>He marched from thence to another town in the neighbourhood, the
inhabitants of which came originally from Chorraſſan, and were baniſhed
thither, with their families, by Afranſiab<note n="†" place="bottom">A
name common to a long race of Perſian Kings.</note>, for frequent rebellions.
Here they formed themſelves into a ſmall independant ſtate, being
encircled by impaſſible mountains; and had preſerved their ancient
cuſtoms and rites, without intermarrying with any other people. The Sultan
having, with infinite labour, cleared a road for his army over the mountains,
advanced towards the town, which was well fortified. He was overtaken by the
rainy ſeaſon, and his army was greatly diſtreſſed; during three
months he was obliged to remain idle before it. But when the rains began to
abate, and the country to dry up, he ſummoned the town to ſurrender, and
acknowledge the faith.</p>
               <p>Ibrahim's propoſals being rejected he commenced the ſiege, which
continued ſome weeks, with great ſlaughter on both ſides. The

taken by aſſault, and the Muſſulmen found much wealth within it, and
one hundred thouſand unfortunate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom they carried bound to
Ghizni. Some time after, the King accidentally ſaw one of thoſe unhappy men
carrying a heavy ſtone with great difficulty and labour, to a palace which
was then building. This awakened his pity; he commanded him to throw it down,
and gave him his liberty.</p>
               <p>This ſtone happened to lie upon the public road, and proved
troubleſome to paſſengers; but as the King's rigid adherence to his
commands was univerſally known, none would attempt to remove it. A courtier
one day, having ſtumbled with his horſe over this ſtone, took occaſion
to mention it to the King; inſinuating, that he thought, if his Majeſty
pleaſed, that it were adviſable to have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. To which the King
replied; 
<q rend="inline">"I have commanded it to be thrown there, and there
it muſt remain; as a memorial of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of war, and my own pity:
For it is better for a King to be obſtinate, even in his inadvertencies, than
to break his royal word."</q> The ſtone was accordingly permitted to remain,
where it is ſhewn as a curioſity to this day.</p>
               <p>Sultan Ibrahim had thirty ſix ſons and forty daughters. The

left this mortal ſtate, after having reigned in tranquility and happineſs
forty two years. In his time flouriſhed Abul Farrhe, who was a native of

Sanſcrita language was entirely unknown in thoſe parts. But he could form
no conception of the cheſs-board, as that game was, at that time, unknown in

wiſdom and policy is always an over-match for ſtrength. The back-gammon

the hiſtorian tells us, that about the time when Feredoon ſubdued Zohac
Tazi, two brothers of that family, Souri and Saam, were taken into favour by
the conqueror; but having by ſome means incurred his diſpleaſure, they
fled with a party of their friends to Hawind, where they took up their abode,
poſſeſſing themſelves of a ſmall territory. Souri took the
government of this diſtrict, appointing his brother to the command of his
ſmall army, and gave his daughter in marriage to his ſon Suja.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Suja the firſt of that race.</note>Suja, after
his father's deceaſe, enjoyed his place. But ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate enemies having
traduced him to his uncle, inſpired him with jealouſy and enmity to ſuch
a degree, that he wanted to take his daughter away from him. When Suja found
this, he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſeek his fortune elſewhere. 
<note place="margin">Flies to the mountains of Ghor.</note>He
accordingly, in the night, with ten horſemen and a few camels, laden with his
effects, ſet out, with his wife and children to the mountains of Ghor, where
he built a houſe and called it Romejandiſh<note n="†" place="bottom">That is, Go without care.</note>.</p>
               <p>Here he was gradually joined by many of his friends, who built a
ſtrong fort, which he held out againſt the troops of Feredoon 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0828000201:230"/> for ſome time, but at length he was obliged to
ſubmit and pay tribute.</p>
               <p>Thus the race of Zohac, one after another, ſucceeded to this
government, which began to gain ſtrength by degrees, till the time of the
prophet, when it was ruled by Shinſub, who, ſome ſay, was converted to

concluding they were thieves, carried them to priſon.

Mahummud Sham, to the government of a province of Ghor called Singia.</p>

confined them in the fort of Goriſtan.</p>
               <p>Alla then turned the hoſtile ſpear againſt Sultan Sinjer, to

coming to an engagement with the Sultan, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and taken priſoner.
Notwithſtanding all which, the Sultan had compaſſion upon him, and again
confirmed him in the kingdom of Ghor, where he died in the year five hundred

               <p>In the year 567, Sultan Yeas ul dien marched in perſon againſt
the Omrahs of Chuſero Malleck, and entirely reduced them. He gave the
government of Ghizni to Shâb ul dien, who, according to his brother's

returned for anſwer, that ſhe was rather too old herſelf to think of
matrimony, but that ſhe had a beautiful young daughter, whom, if he would
promiſe to eſpouſe, and leave her in free poſſeſſion of the
country and its wealth, ſhe would in a few days remove the Raja. Shab ul dien
baſely accepted of the propoſal, and the wicked woman accordingly, in a few
days, found means to aſſaſſinate her huſband, and to open the gates
to the enemy.</p>
               <p>Shab ul dien confirmed his promiſe, by marrying the daughter, upon
acknowledging the true faith; but he made no ſcruple to deviate from what
reſpected the mother; for, inſtead of truſting her with the country, he
ſent her off to Ghizni, where ſhe ſoon died of grief and reſentment.
Nor did the daughter reliſh her ſituation bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for, in the ſpace of

               <p>Sultan Shab ul dien having conferred the government of Moultan and
Adja upon Ali Kirbach, returned to Ghizni; from whence, in the year 574, he
again marched to Adja and Moultan, and from thoſe places, continued his
courſe through the ſandy deſart, to Guze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. Raja Bim Deo advanced
thither with a great army, to give him battle, in which the Muſſulmen were
defeated, with great ſlaughter, and ſuffered many hardſhips in their
retreat, till they arrived at Ghizni.</p>
               <p>In the year following, he marched his recruited army towards
Peſhawir, known in antient hiſtory by the names of Bickraam, Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoor,
and Poorſhoor, which he in a ſhort time brought under ſubjection. He
proceeded in the courſe of the next year, towards Lahore, where he inveſted
Chuſero Malleck, who had been ſo weakened at that time, by wars with the
Rajas of Hind, and the Afghans, that he could not oppoſe him in the field.
But Shab ul dien, finding he could not reduce the place, he intimated a

               <p>Shab ul dien returned to Ghizni, but he could not reſt long in

garriſon to command the countries between the rivers Ravi and Chinab, under
the government of Huſſein Churmili, while he himſelf returned to Ghizni.
This fort, as we have before related, was ineffectually beſieged by Chuſero
Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck, in the abſence of Shab ul dien, which occaſioned his third
expedition towards Lahore, which he took in the year 582, by the perfidious
ſtratagem mentioned in the concluſion of the hiſtory of Ghizni. 
<note place="margin">The Sultan extirpates the royal family of

               <p>When Shab ul dien had ſettled the provinces of Lahore, he left the

in perſon in the centre of the line, when firſt formed, was told that his
right and left wings were defeated, and adviſed to provide for his own
ſafety. Enraged at this council, he ſmote the imprudent adviſer, and
ruſhed on towards the enemy, among whom he commenced, with a few followers, a

as he was ſinking from his horſe, and ſupporting him in his arms, he
carried him from the field, which, by this time, was deſerted almoſt by his

               <p>After this defeat, and when he had recovered of his wound at Lahore,

                  <note place="margin">Cuttub ul dien Abiek,</note>SULTAN Cuttub ul dien Abiek, was of a
brave and virtuous diſpoſition, open and liberal to his friends, and
courteous and affable to ſtrangers. In the art of war and government he was
infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to none, nor was he a mean proficient in literature.</p>
               <p>In his childhood he was brought from Turkeſtan to Niſhapoor, and
there ſold by a merchant, to Caſi Fuchur ul dien ben Abdu, Azizi Kufi, who,
finding that heaven had endued him with a great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, ſent him to

But his patron and maſter dying ſuddenly, he was ſold as part of his
eſtate, by his relations, and bought by a rich merchant, for a great ſum of
money, and preſented for ſale to Sultan Shab ul dien. The Sultan
purchaſed him, and called his name Abiek, from having his little finger
broke. 
<note place="margin">his riſe,</note>He behaved himſelf in ſuch a
becoming and aſſiduous manner, that he ſoon attracted the notice of his
prince, and daily gained confidence and favour. 
<note place="margin">generoſity.</note>One night the Sultan kept a
magnificent feſtival at court, and ordered a liberal diſtribution of
preſents and money to be made among his ſervants. Abiek par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took largely of
his munificence, but had no ſooner retired, than he divided his ſhare among
his companions. The Prince having heard of this circumſtance, aſked him the
cauſe, and Abiek, kiſſing the earth, replied; 
<q rend="inline">"That all his wants were amply ſupplied by his
Majeſty's bounty. 
<note place="margin">affability,</note>He had therefore no deſire

                  <note place="margin">capacity,</note>This anſwer ſo pleaſed the

him maſter of the horſe.</p>
               <p>When the princes of Ghor, Ghizni and Bamia had drawn their forces
towards Chorraſſan, in order to expel the Shaw, Sultan of Charizm, from
that province, Abiek went out with a detachment to forage on the banks of the
Murgaab. He was there ſurrounded by a numerous party of the enemy.

field, and carried to his victorious maſter; who pitying his condition,
received him with great kindneſs.</p>
               <p>In the year 588, when the Sultan took revenge of his enemies the

               <p>The King, when he was ſetting out for Ghizni, ſent the white

way of infamy before them. Thus Ajmere was reſtored to the Mahommedan

his army reſumed their flight. Bimdeo, upon intelligence of this defeat, fled
from his dominions, and Cuttub ul dien ravaged the country at leiſure, and
found much ſpoil. He marched from thence to the fort of Haſſi, which he
repaired, then having viſited Koram, returned to Delhi.</p>
               <p>He in the mean time received advice, from the governor of the
diſtricts near Rintimpore, that the brother of the Raja of Ajmere, who lived
in the hills, was marching down with an army to invade him. This obliged Cuttub
ul dien to move immediately to his relief. The enemy, upon hearing this, fled;
and Cuttub paid a viſit to Raja Gola, who entertained him magnificently, and
at his departure, preſented him with ſome fine jewels, and two melons of
gold. When he had ſettled the country, he again returned to Delhi,

opportunity of frequently entertaining his prince, upon his expeditions to and

making preſents to all the King's attendants.</p>

               <p>The firſt thing Taje ul dien Eldoze did after his acceſſion,
was to invade Punjab and Lahore, as we have ſeen in the former reign. He was

this ſeaſon, but the death of Cuſhlu Chan, governor of Sind. The Vizier,
by the King's commands, led next year an army towards Sewalic and Rintimpore,
where the Rajaputs had begun to raiſe great diſturbances, having collected
a very numerous body of horſe and foot, at the head of which they plundered
and burnt the country. Upon the Vizier's approach, they retired into ſtrong
poſts and paſſes, among the mountains, where, however, he routed them,
and continued to ravage their country four months, with fire and ſword,
ſetting a price upon their heads.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Some rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rajas overthrown by the
Vizier.</note>The Rajas of the Rajaputs, rendered at length deſperate,
collected all their forces, and ruſhed down from the mountains to be revenged
of the Mahomedans. The Vizier ſaw the ſtorm deſcending, and had time to
draw up his army in order of battle to receive them. The attack of the enemy
was violent and terrible, being actuated by rage, revenge, and deſpair. It
was with much difficulty that the Vizier could keep the imperial troops in the
field, but the enemy over-heating themſelves towards mid-day, they became
hourly more languid and faint. The imperial general inſpiring his troops with
freſh courage, for till then, they had acted upon the defenſive, began to
charge in his turn, and, before evening, purſued the enemy, with great
ſlaughter, back to the hills. The Vizier's loſs was very conſiderable in
this action, and many brave Omrahs drank of the cup of martyrdom. Of the enemy
above ten thouſand were ſlain, and ninety of their chiefs made priſoners,
beſides a great number of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſoldiers. The Vizier having, by this
action, relieved the fort of Rintimpore, which had been beſieged by ſome
other tribes, he returned victorious to Delhi. The captive chiefs were cruelly
ordered to be put to death, and their unfortunate ſoldiers condemned to
perpetual ſlavery.</p>

rather that of a hermit, than ſuitable to a great King. He alſo continued
the whimſical notion of living by his pen. One day, as an Omrah was
inſpecting a Coran of the Emperor's writing, before him, he pointed out a
word, which he ſaid was wrong. The King, looking at it, ſmiled, and drew a
circle round it. But when the critic was gone, he began to eraze the circle,
and reſtore the word. This being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by one of his old attendants, he
begged to know his Majeſty's reaſon for ſo doing; to which he replied,

thought it better to eraſe from a paper, than touch the heart of a poor man,

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sultan Balin, his family.</note>SULTAN Balin was
a Turk of Chitta, of the tribe of Alberi, and, in his youth, was carried
priſoner by the Moguls, who conquered that country, and ſold to a merchant,
who conveyed him to Bagdat. His father was a chief of great power, and
commanded ten thouſand horſe in that unfortunate war in which our young
hero was taken. He was bought at Bagdat in the year 630, by Chaja Jemmal ul

maſter having learned that he was a relation of Sultan Altumſh, 
<note place="margin">Sent to Delhi.</note>proceeded with him
immediately to Delhi, and preſented him to the Emperor, who rewarded him ſo
handſomely, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned independent to Bagdat.</p>
               <p>The Sultan employed him firſt in the office of chief falconer, in
which art he was very expert. 
<note place="margin">His gradual riſe in the ſtate.</note>He roſe
from that ſtation, both by the influence of his brother, who happened to be
then an Omrah, and in great favour at the court of Delhi, and by his own merit.
He aſcended gradually, from one preferment to another, till he became an
Omrah of the empire, and a man in great eſteem. In the reign of Ruckun ul
dien, when he commanded in Punjaab, hearing his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at court had enraged
the King againſt him, he refuſed to obey his orders to return, and kept for
ſome time poſſeſſion of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But having advanced to Delhi,
with the confederate Omrahs, who came to depoſe the Empreſs Rizia, he was
taken priſoner in their flight, and remained there ſome time in
confinement. He however made his eſcape, and joined the party of Byram Shaw
againſt the Empreſs, whom he twice defeated, as we have ſeen in that
reign. This gained him great reputation; and he had the government of Haſſi
and Rabari conferred upon him; in which office he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed himſelf
in ſeveral actions againſt the rebels of Mewat.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Made Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier.</note>In the reign of Sultan
Muſaood, he was advanced to the dignity of Amir Hajib, in which he gained
great reputation; and in that of Naſir ul dien he was raiſed to the
Vizarit, which high office he managed in ſuch a manner, as to leave the King
but the mere title of royalty. 
<note place="margin">Succeeds to the Empire.</note>He therefore, upon
the death of his ſovereign, mounted the throne, not only without
oppoſition, but even by the general voice of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and people.</p>
               <p>In the reign of Shumſe ul dien Altumſh, forty of his Turkiſh
ſlaves, who were in great favour, entered into a ſolemn aſſociation

another, and upon the King's death, to divide the Empire among themſelves.
But jealouſies and diſſentions having aroſe afterwards among them,
prevented this project from being executed. The Emperor Balin was of their
number; 
<note place="margin">Rids himſelf of his rivals.</note>and, as
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them had raiſed themſelves to great power in the kingdom, the
firſt thing he did after his acceſſion, was to rid himſelf of all who
remained of that aſſociation, either by ſword or poiſon; among whom was
a nephew of his own, Shere Chan, a man of great bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Courted by the Kings of Tartary and
Perſia.</note>His fears, after theſe aſſaſſinations, were entirely
diſpelled, and he became ſo famous for his juſtice and wiſe government,
that his alliance was courted by all the Kings of Iran and Turan. He took
particular care that none but men of merit and family ſhould be admitted to
any office in his government; and for this purpoſe he endeavoured to make
himſelf acquainted with the particular talents and connections of every
perſon in his court. As he was very aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous in rewarding merit, he was
no leſs ſo in puniſhing vice; for whoever miſbehaved in their
ſtation, were certain of being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſgraced.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">An enemy to vice.</note>He expelled all
flatterers, uſurers, pimps and players from his court; and being one day
told, that an Omrah, an old ſervant of the crown, who had acquired a vaſt
fortune, by uſury and monopoly in the Bazar, would preſent him with ſome
lacks of Rupees, if he would honour him with one word from the throne; he
rejected the propoſal with great diſdain, and ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"what muſt his ſubjects think of a King who
ſhould condeſcend to hold diſcourſe with a wretch ſo
infamous?"</q>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</note>Balin was ſo famous
for his generoſity, that all the princes of the Eaſt, who had been
overthrown by the arms of Chingez Chan, <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0828000201:292"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1265. Higer. 664.</note>ſought protection
at his court. There came upwards of twenty of thoſe unfortunate ſovereigns
from Turkeſtan, Mavir ul Nere, Chor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſan, Ayrac, Azurbaejan, Pharis,
Room<note n="*" place="bottom">The leſſer Aſia, ſo called from being long
a part of the Roman Empire.</note>, and Shaam<note n="†" place="bottom">Syria.</note>. They had a princely allowance, and palaces for
their reſidence allotted them; and they were upon public occaſions, ranked
before his throne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their dignity; all ſtanding to the right and
left, except two princes of the Kalifat, who were permitted to ſit on either
ſide of the Muſnud. The palaces in which the royal fugitives reſided in
Delhi, took their names from their reſpective poſſeſſors, and were
ranked in the following order: Abbaſſi, Singeri, Charizm Shahi, Willami,
Ollavi, Attabuki, Ghori, Chingezi, Roomi, Aeſunkari, Emuni, Muſeli,
Samarcandi, Caſhgari, and Chittai.</p>
               <p>In the retinue of thoſe princes, were the moſt famous men for
learning, war, arts and ſciences, that Aſia at that time produced. The
court of Hindoſtan was therefore, in the days of Balin, reckoned the moſt
polite and magnificent in the world. All the philoſophers, poets and divines,
formed a ſociety every night, at the houſe of Chan Shehîd, the heir
apparent of the Empire; and Amir Chuſero the poet preſided at thoſe
meetings. Another ſociety of muſicians, dancers, mimicks, players,
buffoons, and ſtory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers was conſtantly convened at the houſe of the
Emperor's ſecond ſon Kera Chan, who was given to pleaſure and levity. The
Omrahs followed the examples of their ſuperiors, ſo that various
ſocieties and clubs were formed in every quarter of the city. The Sultan
himſelf, having a great paſſion for ſplendor and magnificence in his
palaces, equipages and liveries, he was imitated by the court. A new city
ſeemed to lift up its head, and arts to ariſe from the boſoms of luxury
and expence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</note>Such was the pomp and
grandeur of the royal preſence, that none could approach the throne without
terror. The ceremonies of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0828000201:293"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1265. Higer. 664.</note>were conducted with
ſo much reverence and ſolemnity, and every thing diſpoſed ſo as to
ſtrike awe and aſtoniſhment into the beholders. Nor was Balin leſs
magnificent in his cavalcades. His ſtate elephants were capariſoned in
purple and gold. His horſe-guards, conſiſting of a thouſand noble Turks
in ſplendid armour, were mounted upon the fineſt Perſian ſteeds, with
bridles of ſilver, and ſaddles of rich embroidery. Five hundred choſen
men in rich livery, with their drawn ſwords upon their ſhoulders, ran
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming his approach, and clearing the way before him. All the Omrahs
followed according to their rank, with their various equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages and attendants.
The Monarch, in ſhort, ſeldom went out with leſs than one hundred
thouſand men; which he uſed to ſay, was not to gratify any vanity in
himſelf, but to exalt him in the eyes of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His juſtice.</note>The feſtivals of Noroſe
and Ide, as alſo the anniverſary of his own birth, were held with wonderful
pomp and ſplendor. But amidſt all this glare of royalty, he never forgot
that he was the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the laws, and protector of his meaneſt
ſubjects. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Balin's time a cuſtom in Hindoſtan, in caſes
of murder, to ſatisfy the relations by a certain fine, if they conſented to
accept of it. He aboliſhed this cuſtom, which has been ſince revived, and
ordered the Suba of Budaoon, Malleck Feick, to be put to death upon the
complaint of a poor woman for killing her ſon.</p>
               <p>When Balin was only an Omrah, he gave into the then courtly vices of
wine, women, and play. But upon his acceſſion he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a great enemy to
all thoſe luxuries; prohibiting wine upon the ſevereſt penalties to be
drank in his dominions; laying great reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon women of pleaſure,
and baniſhing all gameſters from his court.</p>
               <p>So zealous was Balin to ſupport his authority, that for the
diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of one man, he would order a force to the remoteſt parts 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0828000201:294"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1265. Higer. 664.</note>of the empire to
bring him to puniſhment. 
<note place="margin">His ſeverity to rebels.</note>In caſes of
inſurrection or rebellion againſt his government, he was not content, as
had formerly been the cuſtom, to chaſtiſe the leaders, but he extended
the capital puniſhment of high treaſon to the meaneſt of their
vaſſals and adherents. This ſeverity rendered it neceſſary for the
Subas to have the King's mandate for every expedition or hoſtilities they
were about to commence.</p>
               <p>That his army might be kept in conſtant exerciſe, he led them
out twice every week to hunt, for forty or fifty miles round the city, and
eſtabliſhed laws for the preſervation of the game. 
<note place="margin">Rejects the advice of his council to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Malava.</note>In the year 664, he was adviſed by his council, to undertake an
expedition to reduce the kingdoms of Guzerat and Malava, which had been
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the empire by Cuttub ul dien, but were afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to
ſhake off the yoke. To this advice the Emperor would by no means conſent,
ſaying, that the Moguls were become ſo powerful in the north, having
conquered all the Muſſulmen princes, that he thought it would be much
wiſer to ſecure what he poſſeſſed againſt thoſe invaders, than
to weaken himſelf, and leave his country unguarded, by foreign wars.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Tatar Chan reduced.</note>Mahummud Tatar Chan,
the ſon of Arſilla Chan, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to aſſert independence in
Lucknouti, was this year, however, reduced, and obliged to ſend his uſual
tribute to Delhi. A great rejoicing was made upon this occaſion, at which the
King was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and gave public audience.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Mewats extirpated.</note>Balin ordered, in
the courſe of the ſame year, an army to extirpate a certain tribe of
banditti called Mewats, who had poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of an
extenſive wilderneſs about eighty miles ſouth eaſt of the city towards

ſaid, that in this expedition, above one hundred thouſand of theſe
wretches were put to the ſword; and the army being ſupplied with hatchets
and other implements, cleared away the woods for above the circumference of
fifty crores. The cleared ſpace, afterwards proved excellent lands, and was
well inhabited, as the people were protected by a line of forts along the foot
of the mountains.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Emperor quells ſeveral
inſurrections.</note>In the 665 year of the Higera, Balin ſent an army down
between the Ganges and Jumna, to ſuppreſs ſome inſurrections in thoſe
parts, with orders to puniſh the offenders without mercy. The Sultan ſoon
after marched in perſon towards Kattal, Pattiali and Bhogepoor, whoſe
inhabitants had begun to ſtop all intercourſe with Bengal, by the way of
Jionpoor and Benaris. He put ſome thouſands of them to death,
eſtabliſhing juſtice and public ſecurity in thoſe parts. He ordered
forts to be built, which he garriſoned with Pattans, to cruſh any future
diſturbance, and then returned towards Delhi. Soon after his arrival, he
received intelligence of an inſurrection in Budaoon and Kutter, whither he
haſtened with five thouſand choſen horſe, and ordered a general
maſſacre among the unfortunate inſurgents, and ſome thouſands of

afterwards diſtributed among the poor. The Sultan, ſome time after, made a
journey to Lahore, which city, having greatly ſuffered from the Moguls, he
ordered to be put in a proper ſtate of defence and repair; and after having
erected ſome public buildings, he returned to Delhi.</p>

was told by one of his Omrahs, that a great number of veterans, who had
ſerved in the preceding reigns, were now become invalids and incapable of
attending their duty. The Sultan, upon this, ordered a liſt of their names to
be taken, and ſettling half pay upon them for life, diſcharged them from
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervice. The old men however, were diſſatisfied with this
proviſion, and ſome of the principals of them were deputed by the reſt,
to go to Malleck ul Omrah, Fuchur ul dien, chief magiſtrate of Delhi, with
preſents, to repreſent their caſe to the King.</p>
               <p>This venerable magiſtrate being in great favour with the Sultan,
rejected their preſents, but told them he would uſe his endeavour to get
them continued upon full pay. He accordingly went next day to court, and while
he ſtood in the preſence, put on the appearance of ſorrow, which being
obſerved by the King, he enquired about the cauſe of his grief. The old man
replied, 
<q rend="inline">"I was juſt thinking that if in the preſence of
God, all the old men were rejected, what would become of me."</q> The King was
ſtruck with the reproof, and after ſome penſive ſilence, ordered the

demiſe of Shere Chan, gave Sunnam and Semana to Timur Chan, and the other
countries were divided among other Omrahs of his court. The moguls, encouraged
by the death of Shere Chan, began again their depredations in thoſe

down his cheeks. This might indeed be occaſioned by exceſs of pleaſure,

               <p>The Prince, every year, made a journey to ſee his father at Delhi,
to whom he always behaved with the greateſt filial affection and duty. Sultan
Balin gave his younger ſon Baghera Chan, entitled Naſir ul dien, a Jagier

his departure, adviſed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit and diſcipline a good army, to watch
the motions of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guls; and that if he ever ſhould hear of his giving

happened at that time to be very ſick, inſomuch that the news of his death
was ſpread abroad. This intelligence having reached the ears of Tughril, he
aſſumed the red umbrella with all the royal dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and declared

immediately to his allegiance, which having produced no effect, he commanded Ab

drew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Turkiſh chiefs over to his party, and then engaging the

his own fleſh with indignation. He ordered ab Tiggi to be hanged at the gate

                  <note place="margin">Kei Kubad.</note>WHEN Sultan Balin was numbered
with the dead, Kei Kubad his grandſon, in his eighteenth year, aſcended the
throne, and aſſumed the title of Moaz ul dien. He was a prince remarkably
handſome in his perſon, and of an affable and mild diſpoſition. He had
a talent for literature, and his knowledge that <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0828000201:309"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1286. Higer. 685.</note>way was pretty
extenſive. His mother was a beautiful princeſs, daughter to Naſir ul dien
Altumſh; and if purity of blood royal is of any real worth, Kei Kubad had
that to boaſt, for a ſeries of generations.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Luxury pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails at Delhi.</note>As he had been
bred up with great ſtrictneſs under the wings of his father, when he became
maſter of his own actions he began to give a looſe to pleaſure without
reſtraint. He delighted in love, and in the ſoft ſociety of ſilver
bodied damſels with muſky treſſes, ſpent great part of his time. When
it was publickly known that the King was a man of pleaſure, it became
immediately faſhionable at court; and in ſhort, in a few days, luxury and
vice ſo prevailed that every ſhade was filled with ladies of pleaſure,
and every ſtreet rung with muſick and mirth. Even the magiſtrates were
ſeen drunk in public, and riot was heard in every houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Kei Kubad gives himſelf up to

river Gion, and retired thither to enjoy his pleaſures undiſturbed;
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting no company but ſingers, players, muſicians and buffoons. 
<note place="margin">Malleck Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zam manages public

raiſed to the dignity of Vakeel Sultanit, and got the reins of government in
his hands; and Kuaam ul dien Ellaka, who was the greateſt man of that age,
was appointed his deputy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Affaires to the throne.</note>Malleck Nizam ul
dien, ſeeing that the king was quite ſwallowed up in his pleaſures, began
to form ſchemes to clear his own way to the Empire. The firſt object of his
attention was Kei Chuſero, who was now gone to Ghizni, to endeavour to bring
Timur Chan over to his party, in order to recover the throne of Delhi; to which
he claimed a title from his father's right of primogeniture, as well as 
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0828000201:310"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1286. Higer. 685.</note>from the will of the
laſt Sultan. But in this ſcheme Chuſero did not ſucceed, and he was
obliged to return from Ghizni in great diſguſt.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Nizam ul dien endeavoured to make him as obnoxious
as poſſible to the King, who was at length prevailed upon to entice
Chuſero to Delhi. 
<note place="margin">Murders Kei Chuſero.</note>Nizam hired
aſſaſſins to murder the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate prince on the way, which they
accompliſhed at the vilage of Hicke. 
<note place="margin">His many villainies.</note>The villainies of Nizam
did not ſtop here. He forged a correſpondence between Chaja Chatire the
vizier, and Kei Chuſero, and thus effected that miniſter's diſgrace and
baniſhment. He alſo privately aſſaſſinated all the old ſervants
of Sultan Balin, inſomuch that a general conſternation was ſpread through
the city, though none as yet ſuſpected Nizam as the cauſe. The more he
ſucceeded in his villainies, he became leſs ſecret in the execution; and
though he began to be deteſted by all ranks, his power and influence was ſo
great with the King, that he was the terror of every man.</p>
               <p>While things were in this ſituation, advices arrived of another
invaſion of Moguls into the diſtricts of Lahore. Malleck Barbeck beg
Birſe and Chan Jehan were ſent with an army againſt them. 
<note place="margin">The Moguls defeated.</note>The Moguls were
defeated near Lahore, and a number of priſoners brought to Delhi. The next
ſtep the traitor took, was to inſpire the King with jealouſy of his Mogul
troops, who, as ſoldiers of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, had enliſted in great numbers in his
ſervice. He pretended that in caſe of a Mogul invaſion, they would
certainly join their countrymen againſt him, inſinuating at the ſame
time, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there was already ſome treachery intended.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Kei Kubad maſſacres the Moguls in his

ſeized upon all the Omrahs who had any connections with the Moguls, and
ſent them priſoners to diſtant gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons in the remoteſt parts of
the empire. So blind was Kei Kubad to his own ruin, and ſo infatuated by this
deceitful miniſter, that when any of his father's friends, or well wiſhers
to himſelf and the ſtate, made any complaints againſt the traitor, he
immediately called for Nizam himſelf, and ſmiling, told him, that ſuch a
perſon had been doing him ſuch and ſuch ill offices, with an intention to
alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his affections from him. The perſon who preferred the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
became, by this means, a ſacrifice, while fear prevented others from falling
martyrs to virtue and honeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The miniſter carries all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him.</note>When Nizam thus carried all before him in the Durbar, his wife was
no leſs buſy in the Haram. She had all the ladies at her devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, by
way of particular reſpect, was called the King's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Malleck ul Omrah
Fuchir ul dien Cutwal, who had now reached his ninetieth year, perceived the
deſign of the treacherous miniſter, and called him to his houſe, and by
various arguments, endeavoured to ſuppreſs his ambitious ſchemes, and to
lay the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of ſuch behaviour fully open to his view. The miniſter
allowed the juſtice of his reaſoning, and affirmed that he had no further
intentions than to ſecure himſelf in the King's favour. That having,
unfortunately, diſobliged ſo many people, it was dangerous for him to
permit his authority to decline.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Baghera Chan the Sultan's father, who had
contented himſelf with the kingdom of Bengal, having heard how matters went
on at the court of Delhi, penetrated into the deſigns of the miniſter, and
wrote a long letter to his ſon forewarning him of his danger, and adviſing
him how to proceed. 
<note place="margin">Baghera Chan's advice to his ſon is
ſlighted.</note>But his advice, like that of others, was of no weight with
that vicious, luxurious, and infatuated Prince. When Baghera found that his
inſtructions were <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0828000201:312"/> 
                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1288. Higer. 687.</note>ſlighted, and that
things would ſoon be brought to a diſagreeable iſſue, 
<note place="margin">Marches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Delhi.</note>he collected a great
army and directed his ſtandards towards Delhi, about two years after the
death of Balin. Sultan Kei Kubad hearing that his father had advanced as far as
Behar, drew out his forces and marched down to meet him, encamping his army
upon the banks of the Gagera. Baghera Chan lay upon the Sirve, and both armies
remained ſome days in hourly expectation of an action. The old man finding
his army much inferiour to that of his ſon, began to deſpair of reducing
him by force, and accordingly began to treat of peace.</p>
               <p>The young Prince, upon this, became more haughty, and by the advice
of his favourite prepared for battle. 
<note place="margin">A conference proposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and
ſon.</note>In the mean time, a letter arrived from his father, wrote in the
moſt tender and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate terms, begging he might be bleſſed with one
ſight of him before matters were carried to extremities. This letter awakened
nature which had ſlumbered ſo long in Kei Kubad's breaſt, and he gave
orders to prepare his retinue, that he might viſit his father. The favourite
attempted all in his power to prevent this interview, but finding the Prince,
for once, obſtinate, he prevailed upon him to inſiſt, as Emperor of
Delhi, upon the firſt viſit, hoping by this means, to break off the
conference. His deſign, however, did not ſucceed, for the old King,
ſeeing what a headſtrong boy he had to deal with, conſented to come to
the imperial camp, and ordered the Aſtrologers to determine upon a lucky
hour, and croſſing the river, proceeded towards his ſon's camp.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Kei Kubad's inſolence.</note>The young Monarch
having prepared every thing for Baghera's reception in the moſt pompous and
ceremonious manner, mounted his throne, and arrogantly gave orders, that his
father, upon his approach, ſhould three times kiſs the ground. The old man
accordingly, when he arrived at the firſt door, was ordered to

                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1288. Higer. 687.</note>diſmount, and
after he had come in ſight of the throne, he was commanded to pay his
obeyſance in three different places as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. The Sultan's Chobdars
crying out, according to cuſtom, Baghera Chan to the King of the world
ſends health.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mollified up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeeing his father.</note>The
old man was ſo much ſhocked at this indignity, that he burſt out into a
flood of tears; which being obſerved by the ſon, he could no longer
ſupport his unnatural inſolence, but leaping from the throne, fell on his
face at his father's feet, imploring his forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his offence. The
good old man melted into compaſſion, and raiſing him in his arms embraced
him, and hung weeping upon his neck. The ſcene in ſhort was ſo affecting
on both ſides, that the whole court began to wipe the tears from their
eyes.</p>
               <p>Theſe tranſports being over, the young Sultan helped his father
to mount the throne, and paying him his reſpects took his place at his right
hand, ordering a charger full of golden ſuns to be waved three times over his
father's head, and afterwards to be given among the people. All the Omrahs
alſo preſented to him their Naſirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A peace ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled between them.</note>Public
buſineſs being then talked over, every thing was ſettled in peace and
friendſhip, and Baghera Chan returned to his own camp. A friendly
intercourſe commenced immediately between the two armies, for the ſpace of
twenty days, in which time the father and ſon alternately viſited one
another, and the time was ſpent in feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and mirth. The principal
terms ſettled between the two Kings were, that they ſhould reſpectively
retain their former domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; 
<note place="margin">They return to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective

               <p>Before they had taken leave, Baghera Chan called his ſon, the
favourite miniſter and his deputy into a private apartment, and gave

of advice on the art of government. He then embraced Kei Kubad, and whiſpered
in his ear, to rid himſelf of Nizam ul dien as ſoon poſſible. They both
parted in tears, and returned to their reſpective capitals. Baghera Chan was
much affected upon this occaſion, and told his friends at his return to his
own camp, 
<q rend="inline">"that he had that day parted with his ſon and the

Sultan arrived at Delhi, the advice of his father for a few days ſeemed to

writer, having quarrelled with his wife, who was an imperious and vindictive
woman, and fearing ſhe would draw the reſentment of her brother Chingez

and Ghirgiſtan, in his return from the conqueſt of Iran. Three thouſand
of his friends followed Calidge, and took poſſeſſion of thoſe
mountains, where they were afterwards joined by many of their countrymen, and
even by ſome of the family of Chingez Chan.</p>
               <p>Other hiſtorians, with equal improbability, affirm, that we ought
to look for the origin of the Chilligies, as far back as Eaphs the ſon of
Noo<note n="†" place="bottom">Japhet, the ſon of Noah.</note>, who,
ſay they, had eleven ſons, one of whom was called Chillige. But we have
reaſon to think that neither of the accounts is authentic, the one being too
modern, and the other too antient, to merit our faith. We hear of this tribe of
Chillige in the reigns of Subuctagi, and Mamood of Ghizni, which entirely

who ſubſiſt by the ſword; and raiſed himſelf to ſome rank, in the

Keiomours, as a cloak to his villainy;

ſupplied, and actually believed, that he poſſeſſed the art of
tranſmuting other metals into gold. Upon the death of Sultan Balin he
launched out more and more in beſtowing great ſums in charity, and expended
a princely revenue in his entertainments, which were now frequented by all the

hoſtilities, giving out that he had leſt the Emperor in diſguſt, and
was going to offer his ſervices to the Raja of the Tillingas Ram Chunder, who
was the moſt powerful King in the Decan. Accordingly, after two months march,
he arrived <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0828000201:330"/>

remarkable oppoſition at Elichpoor, from whence at once changing his
courſe, he decamped in the night, and in two days ſurprized the city of
Deogire the capital of Ramdeo. The Raja himſelf was in the city, but his wife
and his eldeſt ſon had gone to worſhip at a certain temple without the
walls.</p>
               <p>Ramdeo, upon the approach of Alla, was in the greateſt

three or four thouſand citizens and domeſticks, engaged Alla ul dien at one

fort having no ditch, and not being ſtored with proviſions, he had no hopes
of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it long. Alla ul dien immediately inveſted the place. In the
mean time he gave out, that he was only the van-guard of the Emperor's army,
who were on full march to the place. This ſtruck univerſal terror into all

               <p>Ramdeo ſeeing he muſt ſoon be obliged to yield, and imagining
that the Emperor intended to make a general conqueſt of the Decan,
endeavoured to procure a peace before any other forces arrived. He therefore
wrote after this manner to Alla.</p>
               <q>Your invaſion of this country was certainly impolitic and raſh,

one of your people to eſcape from our dominions alive. Suppoſing even that

               <p>Malleck Fuchier ul dien Kudgi, though he was ſenſible of the

<q rend="inline">"The news of Alla ul dien's return, the amount of

among the mountains? From whence, as the rainy ſeaſon is at hand, it will

that his brother ſeeing ſo many men in compleat armour, might poſſibly
be ſtartled; that therefore as he had taken ſuch ridiculous notions into
his head, which no body could remove, it were better to avoid the leaſt
appearances to favour them. The weak King might have ſeen that this was
overdoing the matter, but perhaps he thought it now too late to reveal his
ſuſpicions, being near the ſkirts of the camp, and that an open
confidence might be his beſt ſecurity. He therefore ordered all his
attendants to unbuckle their armour, and lay their weapons aſide. Malleck
Charram, Vakiel of the Empire, oppoſed this ſtep with great vehemence, for

firſt ſubdued the country of the Mahrattors, which he divided among his

prudently left his ſon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geldeo in the fort, and advanced himſelf, with
great preſents, to the conqueror, to procure peace, which was accordingly
ſettled between them. Malleck Cafoor, upon this, wrote a Fatee Namma to the
King, and ſome time after brought Ramdeo, with rich preſents and
ſeventeen elephants, to pay his allegiance to him at Delhi, where he
himſelf was received with the moſt extravagant marks of favour and
diſtinction. Ramdeo had royal dignities conferred upon him, with the title of
Rai Raian<note n="*" place="bottom">Prince of Princes.</note>, and had not only
the government of his own dominions reſtored to him, but others were alſo
added, for all which he did homage, and paid tribute to the Sultan. The King
moreover gave him the diſtrict of Noſari, near Guzerat, by way of Jagier,
and a lack of rupees to bear his expences home. Thus he diſmiſſed Ramdeo
with princely generoſity; having, in ſome meaſure, looked upon the

the Raja of this place found he could hold out no longer, he ſent his own

its neck, in token of obedience. This preſent was accompanied by a hundred
elephants, and other precious effects, in hopes of procuring peace. The Sultan
received the preſents, but returned him for anſwer, that unleſs he came
and made his ſubmiſſion in perſon, he could hope little from his dumb
repreſentative. The Raja finding the Sultan inexorable, threw himſelf upon
his mercy, and delivered up the place. The Sultan plundered and again
reſtored it. But he alienated a great part of the Raja's country to his
favourite Omrahs, and bound him over to pay homage for the reſt. The Sultan
then proceeded to Jallire, which he took, and returned to Delhi.</p>

Delhi, where he arrived without any remarkable occurrence, in the year 711. He
preſented the Sultan with 312 elephants, 20,000 horſes, 96,000 maunds of

hermits in the midſt of wealth, our wonder will ceaſe, and the credit of
our author remain intire. The gold alone amounts to about one hundred millions
of our money.</note>. The Sultan upon ſeeing this treaſure, which exceeded
that of Baadawird or Pirvez, was greatly rejoiced, and opened the doors of his
bounty to all. 
<note place="margin">The genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Sultan.</note>He gave to
each of the principal Omrahs ten maunds, and to the inferior five. The learned
men of his court received one maund, and thus in proportion, he diſtributed
wealth to all his ſervants, according to their rank and quality. The
remainder was melted down, coined and lodged in the treaſury. It is ſaid,
that during this expedition to the Carnatic, the ſoldiers threw the ſilver
they found away, as too cumberſome, where gold was found in ſuch plenty. No
perſon wore bracelets, chains, or rings of any other metal than gold, while

He ordered them all to be inſtantly put to the ſword; ſo that fifteen
thouſand of thoſe unhappy wretches lay dead in the ſtreets of Delhi in
one day. All their wives and children were enſlaved. The Sultan was ſo

hiſtory of Sidder Jehan of Guzerat, we are informed that the day after the
death of Sultan Alla ul dien, Malleck Cafoor aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Omrahs, and
produced a ſpurious teſtament of the deceaſed King, in which he had
appointed Shab ul dien, the youngeſt ſon, his ſucceſſor, and Cufoor

primogeniture in the perſon of Chizer Chan, and the other princes. Shab ul

Cafoor began his adminiſtration. 
<note place="margin">Cafoor's cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to the Princes.</note>The
firſt ſtep which the traitor took, was to ſend a perſon to Gualier, to
put out the eyes of Chizer Chan and Shadi Chan. His orders were inhumanly
executed; and the Sultana Malleke Jehan was put into cloſer confinement, and
all her wealth ſeized. Mubarick Chan, the third ſon of Alla, was alſo
taken into cuſtody, with an intention to have his eyes put out, like his
unhappy brothers.</p>

ſervants they were; then untying a ſtring of rich jewels from his neck,
which perhaps had more influence than his intreaties, he gave it them. They
immediately abandoned their purpoſe; but quarrelling about the diviſion of
the jewels, when they had got out, it was propoſed to carry them to the chief
of the foot-guards, and acquaint him of what the Prince had ſaid, and of
their inſtructions, from Malleck Cafoor.</p>

regent or vizier for his brother, till he had brought over the Omrahs to his

Ziffer Chan, Suba of Guzerat, among others, fell a victim to his tyranny, as

with the public women to dance at the houſes of the nobility. At other times
he would lead a gang of thoſe abominable proſtitutes ſtark naked along

Decan, had rebelled. The Sultan ſent a great army to ſuppreſs that
inſurrection, who found means to ſeize the rebel and his principal
adherents, and to ſend them to Delhi, where Malleck Ecklikki had his ears cut
off, and the others were put to the torture. Ain ul Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck Moultani was
advanced to the viceroyſhip of the Decan.</p>
               <p>Chuſero Chan, who had gone to Malbar, ſtayed there about one

perfect diamond of 168 Ruttys, with other jewels and gold, to a great amount. 
<note place="margin">Chuſero Chan aſpires to the throne.</note>His
ambition was increaſed by his wealth, and he began to aſpire to the throne.
Not being able to join to his intereſt any of the Omrahs of his army, he
formed the means of their deſtruction. For this purpoſe he called Malleck
Tilbigha from the government of the iſland of Koohe, Malleck Timur and
Malleck Mullhe Affghan, who were on different ſervices, and gave out that he
had orders to return to Delhi. Theſe Omrahs having intelligence of his
intentions, diſobeyed his commands, and wrote a remonſtrance to the Sultan,
accuſing Chuſero Chan of conſpiracy againſt the ſtate. The Sultan,

them to ſeize him and ſend him priſoner to Delhi, which accordingly they
found means to execute. But when he came before the King, he pleaded his own
innocence ſo artfully, and blamed his accuſers with ſuch plauſibility
of truth, that the Sultan believing the whole proceeded from the diſguſt of
their being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his favourite, he recalled them; and
notwithſtanding they gave undoubted proofs of their aſſertions, the
Sultan was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to liſten to nothing againſt this vile catamite. He
diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured them, confiſcated all their eſtates, turned them out to
poverty and the world. The other Omrahs ſeeing that the enemies of Chuſero
Chan, right or wrong, were devoted to deſtruction, the men of the beſt
principles among them made excuſes, and obtained leave to retire to diſtant
parts of the empire: while the abandoned to all honour, joined themſelves to

they reſolved to perform their tragedy in the palace. The Sultan returned to
Delhi, and, according to cuſtom, gave himſelf up to his debaucheries.
Chuſero Chan was warm in his project, and took the opportunity of a
favourable hour to beg leave of Muba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick to entertain his friends in the outer

<note place="margin">Deſtroys Delhi.</note>He therefore gave orders
that the city of Delhi, which was then the envy of the world, ſhould be
rendered deſolate, and that men, women, and children, with all their effects

Dowlatabad; raiſed noble build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and dug a deep ditch round the walls,
which he repaired and beautified. Upon the top of the hill upon which the
citadel ſtood, he formed large reſervoirs for water, and made a beautiful

minds of the people. But the Sultan's orders were ſtrictly complied with, and
the ancient capital left deſolate.</p>
               <p>The Sultan having effected this buſineſs, marched his army
againſt the fort of Gundana, near Jinner. Nack-naig, who was chief of the

his head ſtruck off, by one of Byram Ibah's ſervants. Byram Ibah, knowing
the vengeful diſpoſition of the Sultan, was ſenſible that this
diſreſpect to his authority, would never be forgiven, and reſolved to
ſeek refuge in arms.</p>

upon theſe advices, put his ſpears in motion, and haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened towards
Moultan; and Byram Ibah, with an army numerous as the ants or locuſts,
prepared to diſpute the field. Both armies at laſt met, and, eager for
victory, engaged with great reſolution; but after the duſt of the field was
laid with blood on both ſides, misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune darkened the ſtandards of Byram

ordered a body of troops to maſſacre theſe unhappy people if they
reſiſted, and if they ſhould be taken, to put out their eyes. Many
populous provinces were, by this inhuman decree, laid waſte, and remained
ſo for ſeveral years. The colony of Dowlatabad was alſo in great

Delhi, he led his army out to hunt, as is cuſtomary with princes. When they
arrived in the territory of Birren, he plainly told them, that he came not to
hunt beaſts but men; and without any obvious reaſon, began a general
maſſacre of the wretched inhabitants. He had even the barbarity to bring
home ſome thouſands of their heads, and to hang them over the city walls.
He, upon another occaſion, made an excurſion of the ſame nature towards
Kinnoge, and maſſacred all the inhabitants of that city, and the adjacent
country for many miles, ſpreading terror and deſolation wherever he turned

The Sultan, at the ſame time, received advices, that Seid Haſſen had

reached Dowlatabad, he laid a heavy tax upon that city and the neighbouring
provinces, which awakened the people into rebellion; but his numerous army
ſoon reduced all the unhappy inſurgents to their former ſlavery. From
that place the Sultan ſent back a part of his army and Chaja Jehan to Delhi,
while he himſelf marched with another force towards Maber, by the way of
Tilling.</p>
               <p>When Mahummud arrived before Arinkil, there happened to be a plague

the Sultan's viceroy, to Dowlatabad. Bellaldeo, and Kiſnanaig, having joined
their forces with the Raja of Maber and Doorſummund, who were formerly
tributaries to the government of the Carnatic, they ſeized upon thoſe
countries, and drove the Mahommedans before them on all ſides. In ſhort,
within a few months, the Sultan had no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in the Decan,

                  <note place="margin">The Sultan's tyranny, and diſtractions in the
empire.</note>The tyrannical Mahummud, upon receiving intelligence of thoſe
misfortunes, grew vengeful, ſplenitic, and cruel, wreaking his rage upon his
unhappy ſubjects, without crime, provocation, or diſtinction. This conduct
occaſioned rebellion, robbery, and confuſion, in all parts of the empire.
The famine became daily more and more dreadful, inſomuch that the Sultan, not
able to procure proviſions, even for his houſehold, was obliged to abandon
the city, and to open the gates, and permit the ſtarved inhabitants, whom he
had before confined, to provide for themſelves. Thouſands crowded towards
Bengal, which, as we have before obſerved, had revolted from the Empire. The
Sultan encamped his army near Cumpula, on the banks of the Ganges, and drew
ſupplies from the countries of Oud and Kurrah. He ordered his people to build
houſes, which at length became a city under the name of Surgdewarie.</p>

Cuttulich Chan had done to his affairs in the Decan, and the power he then
enjoyed. And therefore thought it a ſnare laid to draw him quietly from his
own Subaſhip, and then to deprive him of both. In the mean time a number of
the clerks of the revenues being convicted of abuſes in their office, were
ordered to be put to death. Some of thoſe who ſurvived found means to

called the troops of Kole, Birren, Amrohe, Saman, and other diſtricts

there by the Hindoos in the year 557. He diſtributed great ſums among the
Fakiers, who reſided at Barage, and then returned to Delhi. Another
ambaſſador arrived at that time from the Caliph, and was received with the

governors for the Decan, having divided it into four provinces, and determined
to reduce it as before, to his obedience. To accompliſh his purpoſe, he
ordered a numerous army, under the command of Amad ul Malleck, an Omrah of
great reputation, to march to Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latabad, and entered into articles with him,
that he and the other chiefs ſhould pay into the treaſury ſeven crores of
rupees annually for their governments. To make up this ſum, and to gratify
their own avarice, they plundered and oppreſſed that unfortunate country.
At the ſame time the Sultan conferred the government of Malava up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Aziz, a

Muckbil a ſlave, and other low fellows, to the degree of Omrahs, and gave
them the command of provinces and high offices at court. He in this, forgot the

Firoſe Shaw having gained over the majority of the Omrahs to his party,

mercenaries, told him, that now was the time to plunder the late Emperor's
treaſure, and to retreat to their native country. Altu Chan was eaſily
prevailed upon to adopt this lucrative ſcheme. They therefore returned next

in the hands of Sultan Mahummud's family, and therefore, that it would be no
more than juſtice in him, to acknowledge the title of the young King, and act

the city, a number of the principal men in the place haſtened to the camp of

advices were received from Guze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, that Mahummud Tiggi was defeated by Amud

with his head bare, and his turban hung round his neck, came, accompanied by
ſome of the principal men of his party, to make his ſubmiſſion. The

               <p>The Sultan having penetrated as far as Punduah, one of the

adjoining to that of Delhi; and in the following year marched to Debalpoor,
where he made a canal 100 miles in length, from the Suttuluz to the Jidger. The
King, in the year 757, between the hills of Mendouli and Sirmore, cut a channel
from the Gion or Jumna, which he divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſeven ſtreams; one of which
he brought to Haſſi, and from thence to Beraiſen, where he built a
ſtrong caſtle, calling it by his own name. He drew ſoon after, a canal
from the Cagar, paſſing by the walls of Sirſutti, and joined it to the
rivulet of Kerah, upon which he built a city, named after him, Firoſeabad.
This city he watered with another canal from the Gion or Jumna. Theſe public
works were of prodigious advantage to the adjacent countries, by ſupplying
them with water for their lands, and with a commodious water-carriage, from
place to place.</p>

the empire, paying only a ſmall acknowledgment annually, by way of preſent.
He exacted no other terms of the Decan; ſo that theſe two great members

               <p>In the year 759, the Sultan of Bengal ſent a number of elephants

proper not to proceed further, and returned to Delhi. 
<note place="margin">Invaſions of the Moguls.</note>The Sultan, being

place, Shech Zadda Buſtami, who had been baniſhed, returned embaſſador
from the Caliph of Miſſer, with a chelat; for which he was graciouſly

returned with another on his part, and with rich preſents. The King not being
ſatisfied with theſe conceſſions, marched, after the rains were over,
towards Lucknouti, and on his way conferred the enſigns of royalty upon the
Prince Fatte Chan his ſon. He gave him maſters for his inſtruction, to

which was alſo called Benaris. The Raja, upon the Emperor's approach, fled
towards Tilling. Having plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the country, Firoſe Shaw returned, and,
upon his way, was met by the Raja of Beerbhan, who preſented him with 37
elephants, and other valuable preſents, upon conſideration of not ravaging
the country. The Sultan having received the preſents, changed his rout, and,
as he paſſed through the woods of Puddmawitti, which abounded with
elephants, he caught 33 of them, and killed a few in the chace. He then
continued his march, and arrived at Delhi, in the year 762.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Scheme for improving the lands of

country, was informed, that near Hirdar there was a mountain from which there
iſſued a great ſtream of water, which fell into the Suttu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luz; and that
beyond that place there was a ſmall rivulet called Seli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, divided only by a
riſing ground, from the large ſtream which we have juſt mentioned. The
Sultan conſidered, that by making a cut through this eminence, the great
ſtream might be carried into the rivulet, and ſo form a river to water the
countries of Sirhind and Munſurpoor, from whence it might be carried to
Sunnam, and ſo render great tracts of land fertile. He therefore marched
immediately that way, and ordered fifty thouſand labourers to be collected
together to cut the paſſage. When the workmen were in this place employed
in digging to great depth, they found ſome immenſe ſkeletons of
ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants in one place, and in another, thoſe of a gigantic human form, the
arm bones of which meaſured guzes. Some of the bones were in their natural

                  <note place="margin">Firoſe Shaw reduces Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracut.</note>The Sultan
having finiſhed this great work, built a fort at Sirhind, which he called

                  <note place="margin">A. D. 1360. Higer. 762.</note>hail and ſnow. He
however reduced the Raja of thoſe parts, after ſuſtaining ſome loſs
on his ſide, and confirmed him again in his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; changing the name of
Nagracut, to that of Mahummud abad, in honour of the former Sultan. Firoſe
Shaw was told here, that the Goddeſs, whom the Hindoos worſhipped in the
temple of Nagracut, was the image of Noſhaba, the wife of the great Secunder,
which that conqueror had left with them. The name of the idol is now changed to
that of Jewallamuckie. In the temple there was alſo at that time, a fine
library of the books of the Brahmins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of one thouſand and
three hundred volumes.</p>
               <p>The Sultan ordered one of thoſe books, which treated of
philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, aſtrology, and divination, to be tranſlated into the
Perſian lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and called it Dellael Firoſe Shawi<note n="*" place="bottom">Dellael Firoſe Shawi ſignifies the arguments of Firoſe Shaw.
Some authors relate, that the image now worſhipped at Nagracut, is not that
of Noſhaba, which, ſay they, Firoſe Shaw ſent to Mecca, where it was
buried before the door of the great moſque. It is not improbable, but
Alexander, who penetrated to the Indies, might have left an image of one of the
Grecian Goddeſſes, upon the frontiers of his conqueſts. The Brahmins
might have, with leſs abſurdity, converted this foreign Goddeſs into one
of their own growth, than thoſe holy perſons at Rome, who have changed the
ſtatue of Jupiter Tonans into one of St. Peter; diſgracing with a parcel of
keys, that hand which formerly held the thunder.</note>. The Sultan, after the

had been always a ſubject of Delhi, had rebelled and fortified himſelf.

               <p>Feroſe Shaw, in the year 778, was informed that the revenues of

and forty Arabian horſes, every year, over and above the preſent payment,

kindred of the aſſaſſin, putting them without diſtinction to the

They brought back near thirty thouſand of thoſe unhappy mountaineers, who
were all condemned to ſlavery. The Sultan's juſtice in this caſe,
degenerated into extream ſeverity. Neither did the misfortunes brought upon
thoſe miſerable captives, ſatisfy his thirſt for revenge. He returned,
every year, under pretence of hunting, to that unhappy country; but the people,
and not the beaſts of the foreſt, were his prey. He by degrees cut off all

rebellion; particularly thoſe of the eaſtern provinces. Chaja Jehan, upon
this occaſion, aſſumed the title of Sultan Shirki<note n="‡" place="bottom">King of the Eaſt.</note>, and proceeded towards
Behar, with a great army. He ſoon reduced that country to obedience, and
having at the ſame time, forced the Prince of Bengal to pay him the

Gualier, Mubarick Chan, the ſon of Malleck Raja, Mullu Eckbal Chan the
brother of Raja Saring Chan, and Malleck Alla ul dien, conſpired againſt

Mubarick Chan and Malleck Alla ul dien, while Eckbal eſcaped to Delhi. Though
the conſpiracy was thus quaſhed, the confuſions which were the

ſworn vengeance againſt him, for affording protection to Mullu Eckbal Chan,
he fled back to the city, and ſhutting the gates againſt the Prince,

the war was commenced and continued on account of Sadit Chan, accommodated
matters with Muckirrib, and in the month of Mohirrim 797, was admitted into

againſt Sadit Chan, and drove him quite out of the city of Firoſe-abad,
before he had time to prepare for his own defence. To avoid one danger, the

diſtraction. A civil war was kindled in every corner, and, a thing unheard of
before, two Kings in arms againſt one another, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in one capital.
Things however remained in this unfortunate ſituation for three years, with a
ſurpriſing equality on both ſides; for if one monarch's party had at any
time a ſuperiority over the other, it was in ſingularity of misfortunes. It
was not a ſtate of war, but a continued battle between the two cities:
Thouſands were killed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day, and the place of the ſlain was
conſtantly ſupplied by reinforcements from different parts of the empire.
Some of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas of the provinces took no part in this civil war. They hoped
to ſee the empire ſo weakened by public calamities, that they themſelves
might become independant; and to lay a foundation for their future power, they
withheld the cuſtomary revenues.</p>
