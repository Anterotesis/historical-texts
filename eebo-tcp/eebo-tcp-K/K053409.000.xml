            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRACT ON THE LAW OF NATURE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I HAVE neither leiſure nor abilities to undertake a regular definition of <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> with all the doctrines uſually ranked under that head: and indeed, if I had both leiſure and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I ſhould want inclination; becauſe ſuch a work would unavoidably become voluminous, on account of the variety of authors neceſſary to be mentioned, who have treated the ſubject with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent views: and as all ſcience is vain, which is not reduced to practice, ſo the more voluminous any ſubject is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0234601900:4"/>
the leſs it can be uſeful, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the increaſed difficulty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it to the generality of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. I have therefore confined my tract to ſuch <hi>general</hi> remarks on the ſubject, as are moſt neceſſary for the obſervation of my countrymen at large, with reſpect (more particularly) to one point, viz. <hi>the Illegality</hi> of reducing or ſubjecting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to <hi>involuntary ſervitude,</hi> either under political or private dominion: as all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to an <hi>unlimited authority</hi> of any man or men over others, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Natural Equity</hi> and the <hi>Laws of God,</hi> as well as baneful to mankind in general; which effect is unhappily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by the numberleſs inſtances of <hi>unnatural</hi> oppreſſion now prevailing to the deſtruction of mankind, in almoſt every part of the world. I have already ſhewn in my anſwer <note n="(1)" place="bottom">
                  <p>This anſwer to Mr. Thompſon is confined to one kind of ſlavery only, viz. <hi>the oppreſſion of private tyrants,</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0234601900:5"/>or petty ſlaveholders, and has already been printed <hi>in America;</hi> and therefore I need not now repeat the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which it contains, eſpecially as I propoſe ſoon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print it in England with ſome other tracts expreſsly againſt <hi>domeſtick ſlavery,</hi> ſuch as is <hi>unlawfully tolerated</hi> in the Britiſh colonies.</p>

               </note> to the Reverend
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0234601900:5"/>
Mr. Thompſon (an advocate for the African ſlave trade) that the Jewiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions were not ſtrictly conſiſtent <hi>with the Law of Nature in all points;</hi> and, conſequently, that they are not to be conſidered as the rule by which law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and caſuiſts may ſafely determine <hi>"what is, or what is not, according to Nature."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Law of Nature</hi> has been variouſly repreſented; but all the beſt writers, both ancient and modern, agree in adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that maxim of the Civil Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes <note n="(2)" place="bottom">
                  <p>

                  <p>From whence the other authorities in the <hi>Common Law</hi> of England ſeem to be derived.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0234601900:6"/>
or <hi>ſlavery, to be "contrary to the Law of Nature:"</hi> this rule is commonly underſtood as applicable only to <hi>domeſtic ſlavery;</hi> but it is equally true when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to <hi>political oppreſſion,</hi> or the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of an <hi>unlimited dominion</hi> over a whole nation. Some few authors indeed have been ſo unreaſonable, as to aſſert that <hi>"there is no ſuch thing as natural Law;"</hi> but they are properly cenſured by the learned Baron Puffendorf, in his "Law of Nature and Nations." Book 2. Chap. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0234601900:7"/>He particularly mentions the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Carniades as contracted by Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantius to the following effect.</p>
            <p>"That men firſt inſtituted Laws to ſecure and promote their own advantage, &amp;c. but that there was no ſuch thing as <hi>Natural Law</hi> in the world," &amp;c. p. 104.</p>
            <p>Such doctrine is certainly very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for Tyrants and Slaveholders of every degree, who muſt otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main without excuſe, whenever <hi>"the Law of Nature,"</hi> and <hi>"the Common Rights of Humanity,"</hi> are urged againſt them: it is therefore neceſſary for them, either to miſrepreſent <hi>the Law of Nature</hi> (as the Reverend Mr. Thompſon has done), or elſe (like Carniades) utterly to deny its exiſtence. This latter method has been alſo adopted by ſome modern advocates for <hi>Slavery,</hi> who, in private diſcourſe on this ſubject, have declared, that they eſteem <hi>"the Law of Nature"</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0234601900:8"/>
to be no other than their <hi>natural</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to purſue their own heart's deſire of profit or pleaſure: and this they call <hi>"natural Liberty;"</hi> though it certainly is the moſt <hi>unnatural Tyranny:</hi> for when the immutable neceſſity of <hi>reciprocal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</hi> is forgot, or ſet aſide, there can be no ſafety among men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no <hi>natural Liberty:</hi> we muſt, therefore, ſubmit ourſelves to be <hi>the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of law,</hi> in order to be truly <hi>free;</hi> according to the excellent obſervation of Cicero. "Legum denique idcirco om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <hi>Servi</hi> ſumus, ut <hi>liberi</hi> eſſe poſſumus." Tom. 2. p. 208. <note n="(3)" place="bottom">Hamburgh Edition 1618.</note>. We may learn from the hiſtories of all nations, that Luſt, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, Pride, Revenge, Love of Power, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, &amp;c. are <hi>Principles of Action,</hi> which unavoidably produce <hi>oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>wrongs,</hi> to the deſtruction of the human ſpecies, in all places where <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleaſure</hi> (whether in political or private domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0234601900:9"/>
               <hi>are ſupreme;</hi> or whenever <hi>Self-love</hi> and <hi>Private Intereſt</hi> become entirely predominant among men. That <hi>Self-love</hi> is predominant with the <hi>generality of mankind</hi> is but too apparent; yet we are not, therefore, obliged to admit that <hi>"Self-love" is "the univerſal principle of action;"</hi> though an eminent and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>law-writer</hi> has (with very good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, as his argument proves) thought proper to give it that title.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Honeſty</hi> (indeed) <hi>is the beſt policy,"</hi> even for a <hi>ſelfiſh man</hi> to purſue; and, it is certain, that the ſolid attainments of virtue and juſtice afford a real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial ſatisfaction, which in the end, moſt amply fulfils the purpoſes of <hi>Self-love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> are thus favourable to <hi>Self-love</hi> in their <hi>natural effects,</hi> yet this, by no means, proves that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0234601900:10"/>
               <hi>Self-love</hi> is the <hi>motive</hi> of all <hi>virtuous</hi> and <hi>honeſt</hi> men; or that it is the <hi>"univerſal principle of action:"</hi> for, if that were really the caſe, many of the moſt amiable virtues muſt be eſteemed mere empty names. There could be no true Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity or Benevolence; no Diſintereſted Goodneſs of heart; no ſincere <hi>Natural Affection</hi> between parents and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, huſbands and their wives, brethren, friends, &amp;c. whereas hiſtory affords many undoubted inſtances of <hi>Self-love</hi> being loſt in <hi>the ſuperior affections, natural to generous minds,</hi> in all theſe different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of connection; but it is needleſs to recite them, ſince, even in the brute creation there are <hi>natural</hi>

                  <p>That excellent Engliſh lawyer the Great Henry de Bracton informs us, that <hi>"Natural Law</hi> is that which <hi>Nature</hi> (or more properly God himſelf) has <hi>taught all animals."</hi> "Jus <hi>Naturale</hi> eſt quod <hi>Natura,</hi> i. e. ipſe Deus, docuit
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0234601900:11"/>omnia animalia," &amp;c. and afterwards he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explains himſelf, ſaying, "Jus Naturale quod docuit omnia animalia Natura, i. e. per inſtinctum Naturae, &amp;c. viz. Natural Law, which taught all animals by <hi>Nature</hi> that is, through the inſtinct of Nature," &amp;c. Lib. 1. c. 5.</p>

            <p>The timorous cow, it is ſaid, will attack the fierceſt tyger, when her calf is by her ſide. Many inſtances of very extraordinary <hi>Affection</hi> in dogs to their maſters have been well atteſted.

                  <hi>are the eternal, immutable</hi> LAWS <hi>of</hi> GOOD <hi>and</hi> EVIL, to which the Creator him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in all his diſpenſations, conforms; and which he has enabled <hi>Human Reaſon</hi> to diſcover, ſo far as they are neceſſary for the conduct of human actions.</q> Thus THE FOUNDATION is clearly laid down, and there is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to aſſign any other <hi>Motive of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to the ſeveral Laws on <hi>this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> than what is mentioned in the ſame ſentence, viz. <hi>Human Reaſon,</hi> by which men are enabled to diſcover <q>theſe eternal and immutable Laws of <hi>Good and Evil.</hi>
               </q> For <hi>the Knowledge</hi> of what <hi>is Good,</hi> or what <hi>is Evil,</hi> is ſurely a ſufficient Motive for <hi>chuſing</hi> the one, and <hi>rejecting</hi> the other; becauſe

               <hi>Good,</hi> when known, is as truly amiable in itſelf, as <hi>Evil</hi> is deteſtable and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; ſo that the former moſt naturally engages our preference, without any other Motive than this <hi>natural Knowledge</hi> of their reſpective qualities.</p>
            <p>Siniſter Motives do, nevertheleſs, too frequently prevail, through the extreme frailty of <hi>Human Nature,</hi> which engages the greater part of mankind in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of temporal Intereſt, or partial and ſenſual Happineſs!</p>
            <p>So that, if the learned commentator had mentioned <hi>Self-love,</hi> as the <hi>general,</hi> inſtead of the <q>univerſal Principle of Action,</q> I ſhould not have thought myſelf obliged to have taken particular notice of that part of his work.</p>
            <p>Several reaſons may be aſſigned why it cannot be admitted as the <q>univerſal Principle of Action.</q>

(conſidering the great multitude of <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> men in compariſon of the <hi>Juſt</hi>) that ſociety could not exiſt.</p>
            <p>And, thirdly, Becauſe <hi>bad</hi> actions, which moſt abound, manifeſtly tend, even in the opinion of the offenders themſelves, to defeat the moſt eſſential purpoſes of <hi>Self-love;</hi> for the moſt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0234601900:66"/>
ſinners are conſcious, through their innate <hi>Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> that their unlawful temporary gratifications tend to deprive them of their <hi>"real"</hi> and <hi>"ſubſtantial</hi> happineſs," viz. <hi>Eternal Salvation;</hi> for if they had not this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of Evil,</hi> there could be no ſuch thing as preſumptuous ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Self-love,</hi> however, under proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, is certainly a main branch of <hi>the Law of Nature;</hi> and, though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be admitted as the <q>univerſal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Action,</q> is nevertheleſs an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Principle;</hi> but it cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a <hi>"Rule of Obedience,"</hi> becauſe there are many occaſions when it ought to be ſuperſeded by more noble Motives to <hi>Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Knowledge of Good and Evil</hi> is alſo an <hi>univerſal Principle in Man;</hi> though it is ſtill much farther from being <q>the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0234601900:67"/>
univerſal Principle of Action</q> than <hi>"Self-love;"</hi> and indeed my preſent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is not to prove <hi>what is</hi> the <q>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Principle of Action,</q> but only what <hi>it ought to be,</hi> as I before remarked; being convinced, that <q>the one paternal Precept</q> laid down by the learned Law Commentator (though certainly with good intentions, and probably with good authority from other Law Writers) as the <hi>"Rule of Obedience,"</hi> (viz. <q>
                  <hi>that we</hi> ſhould purſue our own Happineſs</q>) is very defective; becauſe the very <hi>Rule</hi> itſelf requires a multitude of other <hi>Rules</hi> to reſtrain it within due bounds, and curb the <hi>Self-love</hi> of individuals for the benefit of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Nothing is ſo liable to be miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as <hi>"our own Happineſs;"</hi> for when <hi>Self</hi> alone is the object, <hi>Self-love</hi> can imply nothing but <hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>Self-preference;</hi> ſo that ſuch <q>a Rule of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</q>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0234601900:68"/>
is liable to afford a handle of excuſe for actions of mere <hi>Self-gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to which the learned and worthy author (or, perhaps, rather the adopter) of the hypotheſis would be entirely averſe: a <hi>Slaveholder,</hi> for inſtance, might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that he <q>purſues his own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</q> by extorting the unwilling ſervice of other men, becauſe he is thereby enabled to maintain himſelf and family, not only comfortably, but ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly; and that the maintenance and ſupport of the ſugar iſlands, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the happineſs of his wealthy neighbours, depends upon the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſlaves; ſo that <hi>ſocial benefits</hi> do alſo ariſe from it: and he will likewiſe alledge, that he is obliged by <q>Self-love</q> to perſiſt in the meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot maintain the ſame <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> and comfort by any other means; ſo that he does not act contrary to <q>the Law of Nature, <hi>or the</hi> "Rule of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0234601900:69"/>
Obedience,"</q> as laid down by the moſt eminent writers on the ſubject!</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>"paternal Precept"</hi> (as it is called) of purſuing our own <hi>Happineſs,</hi> may lead men to form a falſe eſtimate of <hi>neceſſity</hi> (or what they may think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>obliged to undertake,</hi> from their particular ſituation in life) and will afford them the like excuſe for any other vice, on which a man's temporal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence depends.</p>
            <p>It is therefore an <hi>oblique Rule,</hi> which inſenſibly declines into mere <hi>Self-grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> or private Intereſt, which is the bane of Equity and Juſtice; ſo that <hi>Self-love</hi> can no otherwiſe be admitted <hi>as a Rule,</hi> than for the purpoſe of meaſuring the due proportion of <hi>that Love which we owe to the reſt of Mankind,</hi> agreeable to a real <hi>"paternal Precept"</hi> that will

            <p>The learned Baron, nevertheleſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks in the following paragraph—<q>that this Precept cannot be eſteemed <hi>a fundamental Axiom of the Law of Nature;</hi> ſince it is only a corollary of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0234601900:72"/>
that Law, which obliges us <hi>to hold all Men equal with ourſelves;</hi> and therefore may be demonſtrated <hi>à pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori.</hi>
               </q> But howſoever it may be capable of being demonſtrated, yet this is no juſt objection to <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s excellent rule for knowing,— <q>what the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dictates;</q> eſpecially as the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed objector ſeems, afterwards, to have ſought <hi>in vain</hi> for a more <q>fundamental Axiom of the Law of Nature:</q> for I cannot find, that any thing, he has afterwards propoſed, is at all worthy to be compared with it, either as <q>a Foundation, <hi>or a</hi> "Rule of Obedience."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, in juſtice to the learned Baron, I muſt obſerve, that he has well defended this <hi>general Rule</hi> againſt the objection of <hi>Dr. Sharrock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Dr. Sharrock is of opinion</q> (ſays he) <q>that this rule is not univerſal,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0234601900:73"/>
becauſe, if ſo, a judge muſt needs abſolve the criminals left to his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; inaſmuch as he would certainly ſpare his own life, were he in their place: I muſt needs give a poor peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner what ſum ſoever he deſires; becauſe I ſhould wiſh to be thus dealt with, if I was in his condition: or I muſt clean my ſervants ſhoes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I require him to clean mine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But the rule</q> (ſays the learned Baron) <q>will ſtill remain unſhaken, if we obſerve, that <hi>not</hi> ONE <hi>Scale only, but</hi> BOTH <hi>are to be conſidered;</hi> or that I am not only to weigh and examine what is agreeable to me, but likewiſe what obligation or neceſſity lies on the other perſon, and what I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of him, without injuring either of our duties. <bibl>Book 2.

            </p>
            <p>The Jews and Chriſtians, indeed, are taught the value and importance of <hi>this Precept</hi> by the Holy Scriptures, yet this is not the only means of its being known and received among men as <q>a Rule of Obedience;</q>—for, beſides the example which I have already given concerning the Emperor Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus, it appears that the Gentiles, in every part of the world, have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated a ſenſe of this Precept, without the <hi>aſſiſtance of Scripture:</hi> not only the ancient Greeks and Romans, but the

            <p>Thus it appears, that not only the <hi>Heathen nations</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> but alſo the diſtant uninformed inhabitants of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> were endued, by their innate <hi>Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> with general ideas of that moſt excellent Precept which CHRIST himſelf has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the <hi>true Chriſtian</hi> RULE OF ACTION: and which, therefore, may juſtly be eſteemed <q>

               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0234601900:80"/>Having now proved, I hope, that this <q>FUNDAMENTAL AXIOM OF THE LAW OF NATURE</q>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0234601900:81"/>
the natural <hi>"Knowledge of Good and Evil,"</hi> that it may, more properly, be eſteemed an exertion of it: for inſtance, by a due exertion of <q>the Knowledge of Good and Evil,</q> we promote the <hi>very firſt</hi> Principle of <hi>all Duty,</hi> as it is the <hi>firſt</hi> great commandment, viz. <hi>The Love of God;</hi> for if we have <q>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to chuſe the Good, and reject the Evil,</q> the ſame <hi>Knowledge</hi> muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to prefer the <hi>Author of all Good</hi> (when revealed to us) and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments before every other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for ſo Abraham's Obedience in attempting to ſacrifice his ſon, was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered acceptable to God: he knew his Maker and ſupreme Lord by <hi>unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Revelation;</hi> and, therefore, juſtly concluded, through his <hi>natural</hi> 
               <q>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Good and Evil,</q> that the Command of God ought to ſuperſede all <hi>natural Affection,</hi> and <hi>Self-love;</hi> ſo that this was an <hi>Effect of Reaſon,</hi> which

            <p>By <hi>what Principle of Action</hi> alſo was Moſes induced (though the meekeſt of <hi>Men</hi>) to <hi>remonſtrate</hi> to his Creator, when the Divine Indignation was declared againſt the Ingratitude and Wickedneſs of the children of Iſrael, in worſhipping the molten calf during the time that Moſes continued in the mount to receive the Law?

Nay, and that repeatedly on various occaſions! The like remonſtrance was alſo made by Moſes, when God declared his anger againſt Iſrael, for murmuring at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port given of the promiſed land; and

for propoſing to return into Egypt; and alſo for attempting to ſtone <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> who had endeavoured to appeaſe, and convince them of their error.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0234601900:101"/>
that the affectionate and truly patriotic Apoſtle would have been ready to ſuffer every kind of <hi>temporal miſery,</hi> and even to <hi>lay down his Life</hi> for the <hi>refractory Nation,</hi> if he could thereby have averted the approaching vengeance from his countrymen, and reſtored them to Grace and the promiſed Privileges of the Goſpel, to which they had been the firſt invited of all other nations! And therefore we cannot ſurely conceive, that <q>the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Action,</q> or <hi>Motive</hi> to ſuch a declaration, was <hi>Self-love.</hi>

               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0234601900:102"/>The diſintereſted Principles of this Apoſtle are evident alſo from ſome other expreſſions, and eſpecially from that in his Epiſtle to the Romans, (v. 7.) viz. <q>—peradventure <hi>for a good Man</hi>
               </q> (ſays he) <q>ſome would even <hi>dare to die;</hi>
               </q> which idea totally excludes the Principle of <hi>Self-love.</hi> But though the Apoſtle's <hi>Expreſſions</hi> ſufficiently prove that <hi>Self-love was not</hi> his Principle of Action, yet the ſame was more effectually demonſtrated by his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Practice!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, When we read of JONA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAN'S inviolable <hi>Friendſhip</hi> towards DAVID, can we conceive, that he was actuated, by <hi>Self-love?</hi> We cannot men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>Principle</hi> without injuſtice to the generous character of that truly noble Prince, unleſs we ſpeak of it comparatively, to ſhew, that his <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> and <hi>brotherly Love was equal to it;</hi> for the Scripture repeatedly informs us, that he <hi>loved</hi> DAVID <hi>"as his own Soul."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0234601900:103"/>It was not <hi>an unreaſonable Friendſhip;</hi> he was well convinced of the <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> of DAVID; for on theſe he found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Love;</hi> and he had too much <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> himſelf to violate a <hi>reaſonable Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> even though his own <hi>private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> and <hi>very Inheritance</hi> was at ſtake!</p>
            <p>Theſe points were moſt earneſtly preſſed upon him with all the authority that an anxious worldly-minded father could poſſibly aſſume, and yet without effect—<q>As long as the Son of Jeſſe liveth upon the ground</q>

               <q>thou ſhalt not be eſtabliſhed, nor thy kingdom; wherefore now ſend and fetch him unto me, for he ſhall ſurely die.</q> Now, if <hi>Self-love</hi> had been <hi>the Principle of Action</hi> with JONATHAN, he could not have greater temptation! But he knew how <q>
                  <hi>to refuſe</hi> THE EVIL, <hi>and</hi> CHUSE THE GOOD,</q> and would not, therefore, ſubmit (like modern ſtateſmen) to the wretched policy of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0234601900:104"/>
doing <hi>"Evil that Good might come!"</hi>— <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> were his <q>Principles of Action;</q> and he was willing to riſque, not only his worldly dignity and ſtate, but his life alſo, rather than injure and forſake an innocent man! <q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall he be ſlain?</q> 
               <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> 
               <q>What harm hath he done?</q>—And when he found that his father perſiſted in his baſe reſolution, he was filled with honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; and, as the text informs, <q>

                  <hi>he was grieved</hi> FOR DAVID</q> (ſays the text) and that <q>his father had done him ſhame. <bibl>See 1 Sam. xx. 31. to 34.</bibl>

            <p>And again—Was <hi>David,</hi> King of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, actuated by <hi>Self-love,</hi> when he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>his own Life,</hi> to ſave <hi>the Lives of his Subjects,</hi> praying God to <q>Let his

            <p>Surely his Principles of Action were very different from <hi>Self-love,</hi> or from that imaginary PATERNAL PRECEPT of <hi>"ſeeking his own Happineſs!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Conſcience</hi> probably informed him, that he was guilty before God in having <hi>numbered</hi> the Iſraelites, to ſatisfy ſome vain or preſumptuous curioſity concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Strength of the Nation,</hi> at a time when his whole confidence and hope of ſucceſs againſt his enemies ought to have been placed in GOD <hi>alone;</hi> and he would perhaps then recollect, that the ſame <hi>ſinful Preſumption within himſelf,</hi> which had <hi>occaſioned</hi> the undertaking, had alſo <hi>occaſioned</hi>

                  <p>Some excellent arguments and very ſtriking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples have been produced by the truly benevolent <hi>Mr. Brooke</hi> of Dublin, in his <hi>"Fool of Quality,"</hi> to prove

                  <p>To quote the authority of a romance, in a Tract on the <hi>firſt Principles of Law,</hi> will perhaps, at firſt ſight, give offence to many of my readers; but, for my excuſe, I rely on the propriety of the arguments themſelves, and the juſt application of the ſeveral <hi>real examples</hi> by which they are illuſtrated. I ſhould never of my own accord, I confeſs, have conſulted any work under <hi>the Form of a Novel</hi> for information of this kind; but the ſentiments of this ſenſible author being pointed out to me by a worthy friend, I thought it would be injuſtice to my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, if I neglected to refer my readers to the clear light which the worthy Author of <hi>the Fool of Quality</hi> has thrown upon the ſubject, when he makes his EARL OF MORELAND enquire <q>whence, how, by what means may a Man arrive at Happineſs?—By getting out of himſelf, my Lord</q>—anſwered his worthy character MR.

A contradiction in terms, unnatural, impoſſible! —<hi>GOD</hi> himſelf, my Lord, cannot make a Man happy in any other way, either here, or hereafter. It is, ſaid the Earl, an eſtabliſhed maxim among all thinking Men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Divines or Philoſophers, that <hi>SELF-LOVE</hi> is the Motive to all Human Actions.—Virtue forbid! exclaimed Mr. Meekly; all Actions are juſtly held good or evil, baſe or honourable, deteſtable or amiable, merely according to their Motives. But if the Motive is the ſame in all, there is an end, at once, to the poſſibility of virtue; the cruel 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0234601900:109"/>and the kind, the faithful and the perfidious, the proſtitute and the patriot, are confounded together,</q> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He afterwards relates, in very ſtriking terms, the well-known example of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias,</hi> whoſe inviolable FRIENDSHIP triumphed over SELF-LOVE, as well as over the cruel intentions of the Tyrant <hi>Dionyſius.</hi>—Then follows the Author's excellent definition of the term SELF, wherein he demonſtrates the neceſſity of overcoming SELFISHNESS by <hi>ſuperior Principles</hi> originally commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to our Nature by the <hi>Divine Intelligence;</hi> and he proves that <hi>ſuch Principles</hi> have prevailed in the world, by reminding us of the ancient ſtates of SPARTA and ROME, which <q>derived their luſtre and power, their whole pre-eminence and praiſe</q> 
                     <hi>(ſays he)</hi>

                  <p>He afterwards mentions the inſtances of the Roman <hi>Regulus,</hi> and the <hi>Decii,</hi> as alſo that of <q>Leonidas, and his three hundred Spartans, <hi>who devoted their lives for THE LIBERTIES</hi> of Greece,</q> &amp;c. and, laſtly, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifies <q>this <hi>DISREGARD OF SELF,</hi> the vital Source and Principle of every Virtue, in ſix Mechanics or Craftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

And therefore I think we may as well ceaſe to be, by our own power, as ceaſe to affect; and they who have gone furtheſt or moſt covertly herein, have in going about to hide ſome particular affections, ſhewed others more viſibly; and for the covering of their joy or ſorrow, fear or anger, or the like, have ſet up for predominant in their Soul, a ſeeming contempt of all things; which is an affection itſelf, and, for ought I know, as ſubject to be faulty as any. For ſurely the Soul may ſeem no leſs glorious in its march, with all its parts and retinue, than ſome of them; provided it marches the right way, and each faculty help and aſſiſt, and not go about to deſtroy each other.</q> A VIEW OF THE SOUL.

By the very ſame logic that they can prove this, they may likewiſe prove, that all thoſe men that are ſpoken of in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were not real perſons, but qualities. For it is certain, that the Devil is in the Scripture as much repreſented as a perſon, a real ſubſiſting being, diſtinct from God and from good angels, and from mankind; I ſay, he is as plainly thus repreſented, as any man or woman, that is there mentioned, is. And he, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that will ſay, that when our Saviour was tempted by the Devil in the wilderneſs, all this was but a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction of his imagination, and that it was only his own fancy that preſented to his eyes all the kingdoms of the world, and that it was only his own fancy that ſet him upon a pinacle of the temple, and would have had him fallen down and worſhipped it; I ſay, he that would give ſuch an account as this, of that matter, may with the ſame reaſon ſay, that Jeſus himſelf was but a phantaſm, an imagination, and that there was never ſuch a real perſon in the world.</q>

                     <q>The Devil then has a real Being of his own, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of us, or any other creature: and that Being is of the <hi>ſpiritual or angelic nature.</hi> As there are good ſpirits, and good angels, ſo there are evil ſpirits, and evil angels; and of this latter ſort is the the Devil.</q>

                     <q>But then, ſecondly, When we are ſpeaking of the Devil, we are not to underſtand any one particular being, or any one particular evil ſpirit, but the whole aggregate, or company of evil ſpirits, which inhabit round about us in the lower regions of the air.

                     <q>For the underſtanding this we are to know, that among that infinite and innumerable company of angels which God created in a happy and glorious condition, all of them did not continue in that primitive happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but ſeveral of them, by their wilful apoſtaſy from God, forfeited that dignity and glory they were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of, and ſo depraved their natures, that they were incapable of dwelling any longer where they did before: but were, by the juſt vengeance of God, caſt down into theſe lower regions of the air, where they are reſerved by Providence, to the judgment and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the great day.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>This is the plain account that the Scriptures give us as to this matter. Thus St. Jude in the 6th verſe of 
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0234601900:127"/>his Epiſtle: <hi>The angels,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitations, them hath God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in everlaſting chains under darkneſs, unto the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great day.</hi> And juſt to the ſame purpoſe, and almoſt in the ſame words, doth St. Peter ſpeak in the ſecond chapter of his ſecond Epiſtle, verſe the fourth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Theſe fallen angels now thus thruſt down from heaven, tho' they do yet in a great meaſure retain all the intellectual accompliſhments of the angelical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch as reaſon, and memory, and knowledge, yet are they in their moral qualities quite contrary to all the good angels; and particularly as to this, that as the good angels are infinitely kind and benign, great lovers of God and of mankind, and moſt intirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do all good offices to them whatſoever; ſo the nature of thoſe fallen angels is cruel and revengeful, full of hatred, and ſpite, and malice to God, and to his whole creation; and upon account of this, the Scripture hath given to them the name of Satan or Devil, which two words (as all that underſtand the learned languages know) ſignify neither more nor leſs than an adverſary, or an accuſer, or calumniator. The one being the Hebrew word for it, and the other the Greek word. And indeed it is, with reference to this enmity to mankind, that moſt of theſe names and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, that they bear in Scripture, are beſtowed upon them. Upon this account it is, that the Devil is called a murderer, a deceiver, a lyar, and the father of lyes,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0234601900:128"/>the deſtroyer, the old ſerpent, the great dragon, with ſundry other ſuch appellations. But then, tho' theſe names being put in the ſingular number, ſeem to denote ſome ſingle evil ſpirit, that bears ill-will to mankind; yet we are always to remember, that they are to be expounded collectively, that is to ſay, to ſignify the whole body of theſe apoſtate ſpirits, of which there are a vaſt number: I ſay, the whole body of them; for that theſe lapſed angels are formed into a body politic, or government, or kingdom, is plainly enough inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the New Teſtament: for there we meet with the kingdom of darkneſs, in oppoſition to the kingdom of light; and there we meet with the prince of the Devils as the chief of them; who is likewiſe by St. Paul called, <hi>The god of this world, and the prince of the power of the air.</hi> Under whom alſo, as in other ſocieties, there are many ſubordinate officers, as St. Paul ſeems to intimate in the 6th of the Epheſians; where, among the wicked ſpirits in heavenly places (that is, in the air, as Grotius, with the ancients, rightly expounds it) that he ſaith we wreſtle againſt, he makes mention in the plural number of principalities and powers, and other rulers of the darkneſs of this world.</q>

                     <q>This is the Scripture account of theſe matters. I muſt confeſs, it may ſeem a very odd thing to ſome, that there ſhould be in the world a ſociety of ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as are confeſſedly endowed with all the knowledge and ſubtilty of the angelical nature, and yet are ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0234601900:129"/>degenerated in their morals, as to take pleaſure in every thing that is naught, and even in ruining mankind, if they could. But that it is really poſſible that there ſhould be ſuch beings, <hi>doth in ſome meaſure appear from the prodigious inſtances of the depravation of reaſonable natures, that we ſometimes ſee among ourſelves;</hi> there being men of excellent parts and endowments to be found, that do ſometimes ſo far degenerate from human kind, that for all manner of wickedneſs and malice, they may be rather called <hi>Devils than men.</hi> But that it is more than poſſible, that there are a race of ſuch ſpirits, as do malign the welfare of mankind, and take pleaſure in making fools, and wretches, and <hi>ſlaves of them,</hi> is too evident, both from all the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of paſt ages, and from the ſad experience of ſome nations at this day; who (if we may credit the hiſtories that are writ of them) do miſerably <hi>groan under the violences and tyranny of the Devil.</hi> But however, no one that acknowledgeth the truth of the Scripture, can poſſibly doubt of this; for what I have now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, is ſo plainly affirmed in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that there is no evading of it. And indeed, this hypotheſis of the being of evil ſpirits, and their ill will to mankind, and their concerning themſelves continually to do us miſchief, <hi>is ſo interwoven with, and makes ſo conſiderable a part of the ſcheme of, our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as it is delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that we cannot deny the one, without much weakening, if
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0234601900:125"/>not altogether overthrowing, the other.</hi>

                     <p>Having in a former note, at p. 131, made ſome remarks concerning the probability that the preſent <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Globe</hi> (on which the greater part of mankind ſeem to place their whole intereſt and deſire) will hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the region of EVERLASTING FIRE, or <hi>Hell,</hi> I have ſince had the ſatisfaction to find, on a further examination of that point, that the ſame opinion hath been long ago deciſively aſſerted by my own grandfather, in a ſermon concerning <hi>"the manner of the day of judgment;"</hi> and though I could wiſh my readers to peruſe the whole ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, yet I muſt beg leave to lay before them a ſhort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from it, which is much to my preſent purpoſe.—<q>The ſecond particular</q> (ſays he) <q>which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures acquaint us with concerning the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is this; that <hi>the earth ſhall then be ſet on fire,</hi> and that in the moſt terrible manner imaginable. Whether this general conflagration will happen upon Chriſt's coming to judgment, or rather will be the laſt tranſaction of the judgment, the Scripture doth not declare. But that there ſhall be ſuch a conflagration, and that THIS FIRE SHALL BE FOR THE EVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LASTING PUNISHMENT BOTH OF THE DEVIL AND WICKED MEN, WHO WILL ALL BE TUMBLED
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0234601900:145"/>DOWN INTO THESE LOWER REGIONS, WHICH WILL THEN BE A PERFECT LAKE OR SEA OF FIRE (as the Scripture expreſſeth it, Rev. xix. 20.) is beyond all doubt. To this purpoſe let us obſerve what the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, to take vengeance of them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſſ. i. 7.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But more expreſly this conflagration of the world is taught us in the ſecond Epiſtle of St. Peter, Chap. iii. 6, 7. where the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>as the world which was of old periſhed</hi> by an univerſal deluge of <hi>water, ſo the heavens and the earth which are now, are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto fire againſt the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</hi> From whence it is plain, that at the day of judgment this world ſhall be ſet on fire, and that fire ſhall be for the puniſhment of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men. Furthermore, in the verſes following, he adds to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>The day of the Lord ſhall come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; the earth alſo, and the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up,</hi> ver. 10.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>If any one be at a loſs to conceive how the heavens ſhould be ſet on fire as well as the earth, as St. Peter three times in this chapter affirms they ſhall be; the difficulty will be removed by conſidering that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens here ſpoken of, are not thoſe heavens in which 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0234601900:146"/>ſtars are, (in which ſignification we commonly uſe that word) but the ſublunary heavens, viz. thoſe lower re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the air, wherein are the clouds and vapours and other meteors, which are here called the elements, and in which ſenſe the heavens are frequently taken in holy Scripture. Now theſe heavens, together with all that is in them, ſhall at that day paſs away with a crackling noiſe of fire, and the earth, and all the things in it, ſhall be put in flames. David tells us, that <hi>upon the wicked God ſhall rain fire and brimſtone, and an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tempeſt; this ſhall be the portion of their cup,</hi> Pſalm xi. 6. And our Saviour intimates the ſame, when he tells us, as <hi>in the day when Lot went out of Sodom, it it rained fire and brimſtone from heaven, and deſtroyed them all; ſo ſhall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed,</hi> Luke xvii. 29, 30.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>And now who can expreſs the horror and confuſion that ſhall be at that day? Who can fancy ſo ſad and diſmal a face of things, as ſhall then be all the world over? Could we imagine ourſelves to be preſent, when the whole frame of nature is upon the point of diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the whole world in flames about our ears, with what terror and amazement ſhould we be filled? How would our hearts fail us, <hi>and our joints be looſed, and our knees ſmite againſt each other,</hi> Dan. v. 6. unleſs we were ſure we were in the number of thoſe who ſhould be wafted up to meet the bridegroom with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? Oh, what will then become of all impenitent
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0234601900:147"/>ſinners! What will become of all worldly, ſenſual, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, voluptuous men, who ſet up their reſt in this world, and mind nothing but their eaſe, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of their appetites, or the purſuit of their ſecular intereſts! When they ſhall ſee all that they loved, all that they admired, all that they delighted in, gone, irrecoverably gone in a moment! Laſtly, what will become of all thoſe bold profane perſons, who entertained all diſcourſes of a future judgment only with ſcoffs and deriſion! Oh, how will they find themſelves abuſed, and ſee, to their great amazement, what they would never before believe, that <hi>there is a reward for the righteous, that there is indeed a God that judgeth the earth!</hi>

FORNICATION is reciprocal in its effects, by being one of the moſt baneful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles to lawful and virtuous MARRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AGE, and, conſequently, to the increaſe and multiplication of mankind: but this, bad as it is, is not the worſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of habitual FORNICATION; for men, being thereby drawn away from the ſervice and worſhip of their Creator,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0234601900:171"/>
are gradually led to <hi>greater crimes,</hi> whereby their minds are more and more <hi>darkened,</hi> like thoſe of the <hi>fallen Angels,</hi> until they are totally deprived of the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> of their Creator, and loſe both temporal and eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</p>
            <p>When Men are IN BONDAGE <hi>to their own Luſts,</hi> there is no doubt but that Satan has already <hi>"got an Advantage"</hi> over them; and, by <hi>their Luſts,</hi> and unreſtrained Affections, does hold them IN BONDAGE alſo <hi>to himſelf!</hi> So that a Man cannot free himſelf from <hi>Spiritual</hi> Bondage, without forſaking and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his favourite ſins; for we can have no direct idea of <hi>reſiſting</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> (as the Scriptures command us) but that of <hi>reſiſting Evil,</hi> wherever we perceive it, whether in thoughts, words, or actions. But when Men entirely neglect this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reſiſtance to <hi>Evil,</hi> they are ſure
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0234601900:172"/>
to be led on from one vice to another, till the two before-mentioned natural and <hi>univerſal Principles</hi> in Mankind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for their <hi>Preſervation,</hi> viz. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe</hi> (or <hi>Reaſon</hi>) and <hi>Self-love,</hi> have loſt their influence: for the <hi>Actions</hi> of of a great part of Mankind cannot be accounted for upon any other <hi>Principle</hi> than that of a <hi>lamentable</hi> BONDAGE <hi>to the</hi> SPIRITUAL ADVERSARY, who leads them to actions that are clearly contrary to <hi>Self-love</hi> and <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary even to any probable gratification that might afford a <hi>Temptation</hi> to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Beings!—to actions that apparently tend to their own everlaſting deſtruction!</p>
            <p>How common is it for Men to lift their hands againſt their own life, and deliberately to exclude themſelves from all poſſibility of repentance? It muſt be allowed indeed, that real <hi>Madneſs,</hi> or Lunacy, and other <hi>natural</hi> diſtempers
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0234601900:173"/>
and frenzies, are frequently the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Action</hi> which occaſion Suicide; but we have too many inſtances of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Self-murder,</hi> wherein no ſuch <hi>natural</hi> cauſes can with juſtice be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, though generally aſſigned by the coroner's juries, through a falſe notion of mercy, which inclines them to adopt the erroneous maxim, that <q>all Men are mad who kill themſelves.</q> But nothing is more falſe!</p>
            <p>If the Brute Creation were equally liable to voluntary deaths, <hi>Suicide</hi> might with more probability be attributed to natural cauſes <hi>only,</hi> as they are almoſt equally liable to <hi>diſtempers;</hi> but herein appears a capital diſtinction between <hi>Human Nature</hi> and that of <hi>Brutes.</hi> None of the BRUTE CREATION ever violate the <hi>univerſal Principle</hi> of SELF-LOVE, which the Divine <hi>Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> has given them for their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0234601900:174"/>
And though MAN is alſo endowed with the <hi>ſame Principle,</hi> as I have already ſhewn, yet <hi>the very</hi> BRUTES make ſo much better uſe of it <hi>than</hi> MAN, that in them we diſtinguiſh the <hi>ſame Principle,</hi> even by another name, and call it IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STINCT—<hi>an</hi> INSTINCT <hi>of Self-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>—an <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> becauſe it is never violated. How are we to account for this ſeeming Superiority in the BRUTES? Why ſhould HUMAN NATURE be more ſubject to Depravity than they are? MAN, who, in addition to that <hi>natural Light</hi> with which he was endowed at the time of his Creation, has ſince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an additional power of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and prudence for his preſervation, even a <hi>Divine Knowledge</hi> of GOOD and EVIL, that he <q>may know how to refuſe the <hi>EVIL,</hi> and chuſe the <hi>GOOD;</hi>
               </q> and yet is in general infinitely more depraved than the very BRUTES! Let any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man conſider how impoſſible it
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0234601900:175"/>
is, by <hi>natural Cauſes,</hi> to account for ſo extraordinary a circumſtance! That MAN, endowed with ſuch a Superiority of <hi>Knowledge</hi> for SELF-PRESERVATION, and alſo endowed with <hi>Self-love</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the reſt of the Creation, ſhould yet be ſubject to ſuch monſtrous Depravity, as to loſe all ſenſe of both, while the BRUTES are never known to violate that univerſal Principle, <hi>Self-love!</hi> except it be for <hi>a reaſonable Cauſe,</hi> that they riſk <hi>their own Lives</hi> in defence of their young, to preſerve their ſpecies, or through gratitude, as Dogs will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their maſters, which ſurely is no Depravity! To what extraordinary cauſe then ſhall we attribute this very ſingular ſuperiority of BRUTES in a circumſtance ſo neceſſary to happineſs. The cauſe is obvious, BRUTES have never been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>ſpiritual Deluſions,</hi> or to be actuated by <hi>infernal Spirits,</hi> ſince the time that the Serpent deceived our firſt parents!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0234601900:176"/>There is no inſtance, I believe, ſince that time, of BRUTES being really <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by evil Spirits,</hi> except one; and that was (be pleaſed to obſerve) by <hi>expreſs Permiſſion</hi> of <hi>our</hi> LORD <hi>himſelf,</hi> viz. when the Devils entered into the ſwine by the lake of Genneſareth.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0234601900:185"/>The circumſtances of this tranſaction neceſſarily oblige us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the operation of THE SPIRIT upon <hi>Philip,</hi> when he was "CAUGHT AWAY, was not <hi>viſionary,</hi> but REAL; and it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon further examination, that a ſimilar <hi>neceſſity</hi> of literal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation is <hi>equally</hi> included in the circumſtances of the other caſe alſo.

are capable of diſcerning between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and do not reject the <hi>Evil</hi> as they ought, according to that <hi>Divine Knowledge</hi> which we inherit from our firſt Parents!</p>
            <p>This Peculiarity in our <hi>Nature</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore apparently the reaſon why <hi>Spiritual Adverſaries</hi> are permitted by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to approach <hi>Mankind,</hi> though they have no ſuch <hi>general Permiſſion</hi> with reſpect to the reſt of the animal Creation.

(I ſay) at <hi>this Permiſſion,</hi> if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that God has given us fair warning of our continual danger and warfare <hi>with the Principalities and Powers of Darkneſs;</hi> as the Holy Scriptures plainly inform us, that we are continually liable to Satanical influence; and that the DEVIL will get an advantage over us, if we do not reſiſt him as we ought!—In this <hi>neceſſary Reſiſtance,</hi> and the objects of it, conſiſt the principal exerciſe of that aſſumed <hi>Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> for which we are accountable; viz. we know <hi>Evil</hi> from <hi>Good,</hi> and conſequently know when we ought <hi>to reſiſt;</hi> but if we do not <hi>reſiſt,</hi> then we have <hi>choſen the</hi> EVIL, and (in whatſoever mode the EVIL is manifeſt) have given <hi>Advantage to the Devil,</hi> and ſubmit ourſelves to his <hi>Bondage.</hi> The <hi>Choice</hi> therefore, which is ſet before us, amounts to this—Whether we will chuſe <q>the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, <bibl>(Mat. vi. 33.)</bibl>

(Matt. xxviii. 19.) and 2dly, <hi>the Holy Spirit,</hi> which we claim of <hi>the Father,</hi> in the name and through the merits <hi>of the Son;</hi> ſo that Faith in all the Three Divine Perſons is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly neceſſary to conſtitute that <hi>Spiritual Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> without which no Man can enter into <hi>the Kingdom of God;</hi> and as FAITH therefore muſt precede, we may clearly perceive the reaſon why WATER (the outward ſign of initiation to the publick profeſſion of that neceſſary FAITH) is firſt mentioned.</p>
               </note>; by which we bear a publick or outward teſtimony of that <hi>true Faith,</hi> which alone can qualify our claim to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
            <p>Thus Man, through the privileges of the Goſpel, becomes "A NEW CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE," (2 Cor. v. 17.) and partakes even of THE DIVINE NATURE, if his
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0234601900:203"/>
own earneſt and ſincere endeavours are not wanting; for the Apoſtle PETER has expreſſly declared, that this is one of the effects of our Lord's moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes. <q>Grace and Peace be multiplied unto you <hi>(ſaid the Apoſtle)</hi> through the Knowledge of <hi>GOD,</hi> and of <hi>JESUS OUR LORD,</hi> according as his <hi>DIVINE POWER</hi> hath given unto us all things that <hi>(pertain)</hi> unto Life and Godlineſs, through the Knowledge of him that hath called us <hi>TO GLORY</hi> and <hi>VIRTUE:</hi> whereby are given unto us <hi>EXCEEDING GREAT AND PRECIOUS PROMISES;</hi> that by theſe ye might be <hi>PARTAKERS</hi> of the <hi>DIVINE NATURE</hi> (ΚΟΝΩΝΟΙ) having eſcaped the Corruption that is in the World through Luſt. <bibl>(2 Pet. i. 2. to 4.)</bibl>

            </p>
            <p>Hence the Dignity and Superiority of MAN over the reſt of the viſible
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0234601900:204"/>
Creation is manifeſt! We not only poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, by <hi>natural Inheritance</hi> from our firſt Parents, a DIVINE ATTRIBUTE (as I have already ſhewn in the former part of this Tract) viz. the <hi>Knowledge of Good and Evil;</hi> but alſo, by a right uſe of <hi>that Knowledge,</hi> in CHUSING and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the <hi>Good,</hi> and in REJECTING and <hi>reſiſting</hi> the <hi>Evil,</hi> we are capable alſo (<hi>through</hi> CHRIST) of PARTAKING "<hi>even of the</hi> DIVINE NATURE;" ſo that if we conſider this moſt extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Privilege,</hi> which is tendered to us on the one hand, and that <hi>deplorable Condition</hi> on the other hand, which we ſhall probably fall into, if we neglect it (viz. the partaking of <hi>the Diabolical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> by the inſpiration of the <hi>Devil and his Angels;</hi> to which, as I have already ſhewn, we are continually liable, if we do not watch, and reſiſt); it muſt be be evident that MAN is either the <hi>moſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0234601900:205"/>
glorious,</hi> or the <hi>moſt miſerable</hi> and <hi>baſe</hi> of all other Creatures!</p>
            <p>Surely the conſideration of theſe things ought to humble the pride of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate perſons, who, on account of mere temporal honours, and worldly poſſeſſions, are ſo lifted up above their brethren, as to forget that they have <hi>no natural Precedency;</hi> but expect that the multitude of inferiors in fortune ſhould implicitly ſubmit to the will of the worldly ſuperior, in all things; and who alſo ſeem to loſe all ſympathetick concern, all ſenſe of fellow-feeling for the wants and ſufferings of their poor dependants, as if they ſprung from <hi>a different Stock,</hi> and were not of EQUAL DIGNITY <hi>in the</hi> SIGHT OF GOD!</p>

               </q> But our Lord himſelf, in referring to this Paſſage, varies a little from the Original, by making a Diſtinction <hi>of Perſons</hi> between <hi>the Lord</hi> (or <hi>Jehovah of Hoſts</hi>) who ſpoke, and the Divine Perſon before whom the Meſſenger was to prepare the Way—<q>Behold, I ſend <hi>MY</hi> Meſſenger before <hi>THY</hi> Face, <hi>which ſhall prepare THY</hi> Way before <hi>THEE.</hi> 
                  <bibl>Matt. xi. 10.</bibl>
               </q> This Variation from the firſt to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon, from <hi>my</hi> to <hi>thy,</hi> and from <hi>me</hi> to <hi>thee,</hi> proves that Chriſt (for it cannot be applied to any other but Chriſt and Jehovah) was indeed the Perſon before whom the <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> John, was to prepare the Way; and the original Text (which undoubtedly is alſo a true Reading in this Place, as it perfectly correſponds with all the ancient Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions)
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0234601900:232"/>
proves at the ſame time, that <hi>the Way</hi> was to be prepared for <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Behold,</hi> I will <hi>ſend</hi> MY <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, and he ſhall prepare the</hi> Way <hi>before</hi> ME; and conſequently it appears, by comparing both Texts, that CHRIST is included in the Eternal Being JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH. The Socinians endeavour to evade this Teſtimony of the Scripture concerning <hi>the Divine Nature</hi> of the Meſſiah, by ſuppoſing that he is called <hi>Jehovah</hi> only in a <hi>relative</hi> Senſe, as being <hi>the Prophet,</hi> or <hi>Ambaſſador of</hi> JEHOVAH, <hi>the Repreſentative being named for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal.</hi> In like manner, for Inſtance (ſay they) as he that <hi>deſpiſeth Chriſt's Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> is ſaid to <hi>deſpiſe Chriſt himſelf; and he that deſpiſeth him, deſpiſeth alſo him that ſent him.</hi> Luke x. 16. <hi>And he that lied to the Apoſtles, lied to God.</hi> Acts v. 4.</p>
            <p>In theſe and ſuch like Paſſages, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the <hi>relative</hi> Senſe is manifeſt; and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0234601900:233"/>
it may alſo, in a certain degree, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Conſtruction of the Text in queſtion, but yet not ſo as to favour the Socinian Argument in the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The Prophecy, for inſtance, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Meſſenger</hi> therein mentioned (of whom JEHOVAH ſaid,—"<hi>he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Way before</hi> ME) was fulfilled in the Perſon of John the Baptiſt, as our Lord himſelf declared (ſee Note in p. 227.); and therefore, according to the <hi>Socinian</hi> Method of Argument, it might indeed be ſaid of thoſe worldly Men, who deſpiſed that extraordinary <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger</hi> of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and neglected the Doctrine of Repentance, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced; that they, in ſo doing, <hi>deſpiſed the Lord Jehovah,</hi> by whom this Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger was ſent; and, on the other hand, thoſe Jews, who readily received John's Doctrine of Repentance, and attended
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0234601900:234"/>
diligently to his Inſtructions, may, in the like relative Senſe, be ſaid to <hi>honour Jehovah,</hi> by paying due Reſpect to his Meſſenger. But a mere <hi>relative Honour,</hi> ſuch as might lawfully be given to the <hi>Meſſenger of Jehovah,</hi> will bear no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with <hi>the Honour</hi> that is due to <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf:—the latter muſt be ſupream <hi>Honour and Worſhip,</hi> whereas the former amounts only to <hi>Reſpect, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> and <hi>good Offices,</hi> for whatever is more than theſe muſt lead to Idolatry; ſo that the Compariſon can be carried no farther.</p>
            <p>A Meſſenger of <hi>Jehovah</hi> cannot, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, merely as ſuch, be allowed <hi>the Name of</hi> JEHOVAH, becauſe this would entitle him alſo to <hi>the Honour</hi> that is due to JEHOVAH alone; ſo that when Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah ſaid, <q>MY <hi>Meſſenger</hi>
               </q>—<q>
                  <hi>he</hi> ſhall prepare the <hi>Way</hi> BEFORE ME,</q> he muſt mean (if Language has any Uſe)
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0234601900:235"/>
that the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> was to prepare the Way for the Advent of <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf, who could not be ſaid to come in the Perſon of any <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> or Ambaſſador whatſoever, except in one of the Divine Perſons that are manifeſtly included in the ſame Eternal BEING, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are entitled to the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Name,</hi> of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH! This glorious Title JEHOVAH is no where in Scripture attributed to any Perſon whatever, that is not thus included in the Unity of the Godhead, neither can it be without Blaſphemy (ſo that the Socinian Argument muſt fall to the Ground) becauſe it is the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Title of the ſupreme Divine Nature!—<q>
                  <hi>Thou, whoſe Name alone</hi> (is) JEHOVA (art) the moſt High over all the Earth. <bibl>Pſal. lxxxiii. 18.</bibl>

            <p>This Diviſion of the Sentence is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all the ancient Verſions, except the Syriac; but, in either way of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating, the Name of JEHOVAH is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly given as <hi>the diſtinguiſhing Title of the ſupreme</hi> GOD; and cannot therefore be attributed to any Perſon whatever, that is not <hi>truly God,</hi> becauſe the ſaid Diſtinction would be deſtroyed, if the Name was ever uſed merely in that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Senſe for which the Socinians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: Proper Names, indeed, were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently formed or compounded with that Holy Name, by having it prefixed, or poſtfixed, to ſome other Word, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently with an Intention to diſtinguiſh <hi>the Servants of</hi> JEHOVAH <note n="(97)" place="bottom">See my Remarks concerning the Names <hi>Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin,</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> in my Tract on <q>the Law of Retribution, <bibl>p. 47.</bibl>

                  <p>My reaſon for making this remark is, that ſome learned Men, in their Comments on Jeremiah xxxiii. 16. (viz.

"JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUSNESS! The learned and Rev. Mr. William Lowth (formerly Prebendary of Wincheſter) in his Commentary on Jeremiah, p. 293. alſo applies it to <q>
                        <hi>JERUSALEM,</hi> that is <hi>(ſays he)</hi> to the <hi>CHURCH,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. The learned

                        <hi>And this</hi> (is the name) <hi>wherewith</hi> SHE <hi>ſhall be called,</hi> THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</q> So Vitringa—<q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe texts, indeed, are aſſurances of God's love to <hi>the Houſe of Iſrael;</hi> but in Chriſt, even <hi>the Gentiles</hi> are entitled to claim them, being now engrafted on the ſtock of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (ſee p. 296) and are thereby rendered <q>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe. <bibl>(Gal. iii. 29.)</bibl>
                     </q> And under the New Covenant, alſo, God hath confirmed theſe aſſurances of favour <hi>on his part,</hi> if we are not wanting to <hi>ourſelves,</hi> promiſing us that we ſhall <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> if we will but <hi>aſk</hi> (ſee note in p. 395)—<q>For <hi>THE LORD</hi> is not ſlack concerning his promiſe, as ſome

                     </q> From hence it follows, that, if any periſh, it is not by God's <hi>Will,</hi> (though he certainly foreknows their deſtruction) but by their own <hi>wilful</hi> Abuſe of the <hi>Knowledge of Good and Evil;</hi> for we are aſſured alſo by another Apoſtle, that GOD <q>will have <hi>ALL MEN</hi> to be ſaved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth. <bibl>(1 Tim. ii. 4.)</bibl>

                        <hi>here ſtands for</hi> EVERY MAN; for ſo it is uſed ver. 1. where we are commanded to pray for ALL MEN. Hence (ſays he) we may argue, that if God WILLS the Salvation of ALL MEN, and would have ALL come to the acknowledgment of the Truth, then he affords ALL ſufficient MEANS and GRACE, in order to their obtaining Salvation; becauſe without this they cannot be ſaved. <bibl>(See John vi. 44. quoted in the beginning of this note)</bibl>
                     </q>. <q>If any therefore periſh, it is not becauſe God DENIES them GRACE and HELP, but becauſe they are WANTING TO THEMSELVES, and WILL NOT BE PREVAILED WITH to USE the aſſiſtance he affords.

                              </q> undoubtedly that ſame wounded <hi>ſide</hi> which had been pierced with a lance; for it was manifeſtly on account of the <hi>wounds,</hi> which he had received in his <hi>fleſh,</hi> that he now pointed

That our Lord appealed to the evidence of real <hi>wounds</hi> in his <hi>fleſh,</hi> is further demonſtrated by the declaration of the Apoſtle Thomas, when he had heard the account of our Lord's appearance from the other diſciples: for Thomas anſwered them, ſaying—<q>Except I ſhall ſee in his <hi>HANDS</hi> the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thruſt my hand into his <hi>SIDE,</hi> I will not believe.</q> And accordingly, this palpable and unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able demonſtration was graciouſly allowed him, even in the preſence of the former witneſſes; for—<q>After eight days, again the diſciples were within, and <hi>THOMAS</hi> with them: <hi>(then)</hi> came Jeſus, the doors being ſhut, <hi>AND STOOD IN THE MIDST,</hi> and ſaid, Peace <hi>(be)</hi> unto you.

For though we may not be able to anſwer his queſtion, viz. <q>Who is he that heard the inſtrumental ſound of the <hi>FIRST</hi> Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet?</q> Yet any plain honeſt Chriſtian, who reads his Bible with a proper humble diſpoſition, can eaſily inform him, who they were (even a whole nation at once) that really and truly heard the actual ſound of a <hi>former</hi> heavenly <hi>trumpet.</hi> See the 19th chapter of Exodus; wherein the <hi>inſtrumental ſound</hi> is clearly expreſſed by two different tech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Hebrew names of an <hi>inſtrument,</hi> well known among the Iſraelites, which ſeems to have been a kind of <hi>horn</hi> or <hi>cornet.</hi> The uſe of ſuch <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi> is particularly recorded in Joſhua vi, 4, for ſeven of them were <hi>ſounded</hi> by the prieſts at the taking of Jericho. The <hi>ſound</hi> only of <hi>one inſtrument</hi> (bearing two different names) was heard at Mount Sinai, tho' it is deſcribed as being loud to a moſt tremendous degree, being a <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> trumpet. And anſwerable to this the future <hi>heavenly</hi> trumpet,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0234601900:406"/>foretold by St. Paul, is mentioned in the ſingular number, viz. <q>the trump of God. <bibl>1 Theſſ. iv. 16.</bibl>
                              </q>—Now as the <hi>ſounding</hi> of the <hi>former</hi> trumpet was previouſly appointed and foretold, as the awful ſignal to apprize the Iſraelites of <hi>the Coming of Jehovah</hi> upon Mount Sinai, and to ſummon them up to the Mount (ſee Exodus xix. 11, and 13.) ſo the actual tremendous <hi>ſounding</hi> of that former trumpet (ſee verſes 16 and 19) is an inconteſtible earneſt or pledge to us (even upon the principles of this author's own argument) that we ought to expect an actual <hi>ſounding</hi> alſo of the <hi>laſt trumpet,</hi> becauſe it is as clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be the <hi>awful ſignal</hi> of the future <hi>Coming</hi> and <hi>Appearance</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to judge the world, as the <hi>former</hi> trumpet was of the deſcent of <hi>Jehovah</hi> upon Mount Sinai, ſo that the ingenious hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis of this Author about the <hi>ſoundleſs</hi> ſummons of the <hi>laſt</hi> trumpet falls at once to the ground!</p>
                           <p>There is ſuch ample evidence (God be thanked) of <hi>outward</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions throughout the whole account which Moſes has given of God's <hi>coming down</hi> upon Mount Sinai (or Horeb, which is only a different part of the ſame mountain) that the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe of his relation cannot, without the moſt glaring perverſion, be enveloped and darkened by the deluſive miſt of <hi>figurative</hi> ſophiſtry! And the ſame, indeed, may be ſaid of what is revealed to us in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concerning the future <hi>Coming</hi> and <hi>Appearance</hi> of the Meſſiah to judge the world; but this Author nevertheleſs (preſuming upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed force of his inſidious quibble about the <hi>laſt</hi> trumpet) ventures openly to profeſs his diſbelief of the actual <hi>future judgment of the world by Chriſt;</hi> and boldly aſſerts, that <q>there will be no ſuch proceſs hereafter.
