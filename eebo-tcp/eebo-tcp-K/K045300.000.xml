            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT being peculiarly the buſineſs of a dramatic writer, to
ſelect thoſe popular topics upon which he is aſſured of having the
public voice with him, it might na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be expected that, after receiving
Your ROYAL HIGHNESS's gracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to lay this Dramatic Eſſay
at Your feet, I ſhould eagerly have availed myſelf of the opportunity thus
given me, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiating on thoſe manners, talents, and virtues, which
conſtitute ſo general a theme of admiration. But minds truly <pb facs="tcp:1182801700:3"/>
conſcious of meriting praiſe are ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and delicate in accepting
it: and perhaps Your ROYAL HIGHNESS will not ſuffer a ſincere
acknowledgment of merit, becauſe the panegyric of Princes has been too often
ſtained with adulation.</p>
            <p>Reſtrained by this conſideration, I muſt content myſelf
with offering my humble acknowledgments for the honour confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on me, in the
countenance of my fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble endeavours to cultivate an elegant art which ſo
eminently boaſts the protection of Your ROYAL HIGHNESS.</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>I am, with the moſt profound reſpect, Your ROYAL
HIGHNESS's Moſt obedient, And moſt devoted ſervant, JAMES COBB.</signed>

            <p>THE Author of the STRANGERS AT HOME would think himſelf guilty
of great injuſtice, if at a moment when the Piece is ſo highly honoured by
the public approbation, he ſhould forget how much of that approbation he owes
to the abilities of the Performers, all of whom ſo kindly intereſted
themſelves in its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. To Mr. KING he has peculiar obligations, for
the care and attention with which he ſuperintended the rehearſals of the
Opera; and to that Gentleman's judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious criticiſms he is likewiſe highly
indebted. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it might be ſuperfluous for the Author to add his
praiſes to thoſe which the public have ſo liberally and deſervedly
beſtowed on Mr. LINLEY's Muſic, he cannot but congratulate himſelf on
having had the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of ſo able a Maſter.</p>

                  <p>They treated me with my <hi>board,</hi> to be ſure—to
ſleep on, I mean; a ſcarcity of bread and water; and plenty of ſtripes
