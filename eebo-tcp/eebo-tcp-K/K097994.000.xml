            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>FROM many propoſitions diſperſed through
the writings of the ancient geometers, and
more eſpecially from one whole treatiſe, it
appears, that the proceſs, by which they
inveſtigated the ſolutions of their problems, was for
the moſt part the reverſe of the method, whereby
they demonſtrated thoſe ſolutions. But what they
have delivered upon the tangents of curve lines, and
the menſuration of curvilinear ſpaces, does not fall
under this obſervation; for the analyſis, they made
uſe of in theſe caſes, is no where to be met with in
their works. In later times, indeed, a method for
inveſtigating ſuch kind of problems has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced,
by conſidering all curves, as compoſed of
an infinite number of indiviſible ſtreight lines, and
curvilinear ſpaces, as compoſed in the like manner
of parallelograms. But this being an obſcure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct
conception, it was obnoxious to error.</p>
               <p>SIR Iſaac Newton therefore, to avoid the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
with which this method of indiviſibles was
juſtly charg'd, inſtituted an analyſis for theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
upon other principles. Conſidering magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
not under the notion of being increaſed by a
repeated acceſſion of parts, but as generated by a
continued motion or flux; he diſcovered a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to compare together the velocities, wherewith
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0218900500:5"/>
homogeneous magnitudes increaſe, and thereby has
taught an analyſis free from all obſcurity and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs.</p>
               <p>MOREOVER to facilitate the demonſtrations for
theſe kinds of problems, he invented a ſynthetic form
of reaſoning from the prime and ultimate ratios of the
contemporaneous augments, or decrements of thoſe
magnitudes, which is much more conciſe than the
method of demonſtrating uſed in theſe caſes by the
ancients, yet is equally diſtinct and concluſive.</p>
               <p>OF this analyſis, called by Sir Iſaac Newton his
method of fluxions, and of his doctrine of prime and
ultimate ratios, I intend to write in the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
For though Sir Iſaac Newton has very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
explained both theſe ſubjects, the firſt in his
treatiſe on the Quadrature of curves, and the other in
his Mathematical principles of natural philoſophy;
yet as the author's great brevity has made a more
diffuſive illuſtration not altogether unneceſſary; I
have here endeavoured to conſider more at large
each of theſe methods; whereby, I hope, it will
appear, they have all the accuracy of the ſtricteſt
mathematical demonſtration.</p>

               <head>OF FLUXIONS.</head>
               <p>IN the method of fluxions geometrical mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes
are not preſented to the mind, as
compleatly formed at once, but as riſing
gradually before the imagination by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome of their extremes <note n="*" place="bottom">Newt. Introd ad Quad. Curv.</note>.</p>
               <p>THUS the line AB may be conceived to be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by a point moving on
from A to B, <figure/>either with an equable motion, or
with a velocity in any manner varied. And the
velocity, or degree of ſwiftneſs, with which this
point moves in any part of the line, AB, is called
the fluxion of this line at that place.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, ſuppoſe two lines AB and AC to form
a ſpace unbounded
toward BC; and
upon AB a line DE
to be erected.<figure/>
               </p>
               <p>NOW, if this
line DE be put in motion (ſuppoſe ſo
as to keep always parallel to itſelf,) as ſoon as it</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0218900500:7"/>
has paſſed the point A, a ſpace bounded on all ſides
will begin to appear between theſe three lines. For
inſtance, when DE is
moved into the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
FG, theſe three
lines will include the
ſpace AFH. <figure/>Here
it is evident, that this
ſpace will increaſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
or ſlower, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the degree
of velocity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the line DE ſhall
move. It is alſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that though the
line DE ſhould move
with an even pace, the
ſpace AFH would
not for that reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
equably; but where the line AC was fartheſt diſtant from AB,
the ſpace AFH would increaſe faſteſt. Now the
velocity or celerity, wherewith the ſpace AFH
at all times increaſes, is called the fluxion of that
ſpace.</p>
               <p>HERE it is obvious, that the velocity, wherewith
the ſpace augments, is not to be underſtood lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the degree of ſwiftneſs, with which either the
line FG, or any other line or point appertaining
to the curve actually moves; but as this ſpace, while
the line FG moves on uniformity, will increaſe
more, in the ſame portion of time, at ſome places,
than at others; the terms velocity and celerity are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0218900500:8"/>
applied in a figurative ſenſe to denote the degree,
wherewith this augmentation in every part proceeds.</p>
               <p>BUT we may diveſt the conſideration of the fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſpace from this figurative phraſe, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a point ſo to paſs over any ſtreight line IK,
that the length IL meaſured out, while the line
DE is moving from A to F, ſhall augment in the
ſame proportion with the ſpace AFH. For
this line being thus deſcribed faſter or ſlower in
the ſame proportion, as the ſpace receives its aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;
the velocity or degree of ſwiftneſs,
wherewith the point deſcribing this line actually
mores, will mark out the degree of celerity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the ſpace every where increaſes. And here
the line IL will preſerve always the ſame analogy
to the ſpace AFH, in ſo much, that, when the line
DE is advanced into any other ſituation MNO,
if IP be to IL in the proportion of the ſpace
AMN to the ſpace AFH, the fluxion of the ſpace
at MN will be to the fluxion thereof at FH, as
the velocity, wherewith the point deſcribing the
line IK moves at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, to the velocity of the ſame
at L. And if any other ſpace QRST be deſcribed
along with the former by the like motion, and at
the ſame time a line VW, ſo that the portion VX
ſhall always have to the length IL the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the ſpace QRST bears to the ſpace AFH;
the fluxion of this latter ſpace at TS will be to the
fluxion of the former at FH, as the velocity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the line VW is deſcribed at X, to the velocity,
wherewith IK is deſcribed at L. It will hereafter
appear, that in all the applications of fluxions to geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical
problems, where ſpaces are concerned, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0218900500:9"/>
more is neceſſary, than to determine the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
wherewith ſuch lines as theſe are deſcribed <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 23.</note>.</p>
               <p>IN the ſame manner may a ſolid ſpace be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to augment with a continual flux, by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome plane, whereby it is bounded; and
the velocity of its augmentation (which may be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
in like manner) will be the fluxion of that
ſolid.</p>
               <p>FLUXIONS then in general are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities,
with which magnitudes varying by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
motion increaſe or diminiſh; and the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes
themſelves are reciprocally called the fluents
of thſe fluxions <note n="**" place="bottom">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4+ letters">

               <p>AND as different fluents may be underſtood to
be deſcribed together in ſuch manner, as conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to preſerve ſome one known relation to each
other; the doctrine of fluxions teaches, how to
aſſign at all times the proportion between the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities,
wherewith homogeneous magnitudes, vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus together, augment or diminiſh.</p>
               <p>THIS doctrine alſo reaches on the other hand,
how from the relation known between the fluxions,
to diſcover what relation the fluents themſelves,
bear to each other.</p>
               <p>IT is by means of this proportion only, that
fluxions are applied to geometrical, uſes;, for this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0218900500:10"/>
doctrine never requires any determinate degree of
velocity to be aſſigned for the fluxion of any one
fluent. And that the proportion between the fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of magnitudes is aſſignable from the relation
known between the magnitudes themſelves, I now
proceed to ſhew.</p>
               <p>IN the firſt place, let us ſuppoſe two lines AB and
CD to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by two
points, <figure/>one
ſetting out
from A, and the other from C, and to move in ſuch
manner, that if AE and CF are lengths deſcribed
in the ſame time, CF ſhall be analogous to ſome
power of AE, that is, if AE be denoted by the
letter <hi>x,</hi> then CF ſhall always be denoted by <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
where <hi>a</hi> repreſents ſome given line, and <hi>n</hi> any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
whatever. Here, I ſay, the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the velocity of the point moving on AB to
the velocity of that moving on CD, is at all times
aſſignable.</p>
               <p>FOR let any other ſituations, that theſe moving
points ſhall have at the ſame inſtant of time, be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
either farther advanced from E and F, as at
G and H, or ſhort of the ſame, as at I and K;
then if EG be denoted by <hi>e,</hi> CH, the length
paſſed over by the point moving on the line CD,
while the point in the line AB has paſſed from A
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0218900500:11"/>
to G, will be expreſſed by <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and if EI be
denoted by <hi>e,</hi> CK, the length paſſed over by the
point moving on the line CD, while the point mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in AB has got only to I, will be denoted by
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: or reducing each of theſe terms into a
ſeries, CH will be denoted by <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and CK by <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Hence all the

               <p>WHEN the number <hi>n</hi> is greater than unite,
while the line AB is deſcribed with a uniform mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the point, wherewith CD is deſcribed, moves
with a velocity continually accelerated; for if IE
be equal to EG, FH will be greater than KF.</p>
               <p>NOW here, I ſay, that neither the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of FH to EG, nor the proportion of KF
to IE is the proportion of the velocity, which the
point moving on CD has at F, to the uniform
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0218900500:12"/>
velocity, wherewith the point moves on the line
AB. For, while that point is advanced from E
to G,<figure/> the point mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on CD has paſſed
from F
to H, and has moved through that ſpace with a
velocity continually accelerated; therefore, if it
had moved during the ſame interval of time with
the velocity, it has at F, uniformly continued, it
would not have paſſed over ſo long a line; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
FH bears a greater proportion to EG,
than what the velocity, which the point moving on
CD has at F, bears to the velocity of the point
moving uniformly on AB.</p>
               <p>IN like manner KF bears to IE a leſs propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than that, which the velocity of the point in
CD has at F, to the velocity of that in AB. For
as the point in CD, in moving from K to F, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
with a velocity continually accelerated; with
the velocity, it has acquired at F, if uniformly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
it would deſcribe in the ſame ſpace of time
a line longer than KF.</p>
               <p>IN the laſt place I ſay, that no line whatever,
that ſhall be greater or leſs than the line repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the ſecond term of the foregoing ſeries (<hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>THUS have we here made appear, that from

                  </gap> augments, to the velocity, wherewith AE,
or <hi>x</hi> is at the ſame time augmented.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0218900500:16"/>
AGAIN, in the three lines AB, CD, EF,
where the points A, C, E are given, let us ſuppoſe
G, H and I to be three contemporary poſitions of
the points, whereby the three lines AB, CD, EF
are reſpectively deſcribed; and let the motion of the
point deſcribing the line EF be ſo regulated with
regard to the motion of the other two points, that
<figure/>
the rectangle under EI and ſome given line may
be always equal to the rectangle under AG and
CH. Here from the velocities, or degrees of ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
wherewith the points deſcribing AB and CD
move, the degree of ſwiftneſs, wherewith the point
deſcribing EF moves, may be determined.</p>
               <p>THE points moving on the lines AB, CD
may either move both the ſame way, or one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and the other backwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0218900500:17"/>
IN the firſt place ſuppoſe them to move the ſame
way, advancing forward from A and C; and ſince
ſome given line forms with EI a rectangle equal to
that under AG and CH, ſuppoſe QT × EI
= AG × CH: then, if K, L, M are contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
poſitions of the points moving on the lines AB,
CD, EF, when advanced forward beyond G, H and
I; and N, O, P, three other contemporary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
of the ſame points, before they are arrived at
G, H and I; QT × EM will alſo be = AK × CL,
and QT × EP = AN × CO; therefore the rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
under IM (the difference of the lines EI and
EM) and QT will be = AK × HL + CH × GK,
and IP × QT = AN × HO + CH × GN.</p>
               <p>HERE the proportion of the velocity, which the
point moving on AB has at G, to that, which the point
moving on CD has at H, may either keep always
the ſame or continually vary, and one of theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities,
ſuppoſe that of the point moving on the
line CD, have to the other a proportion gradually
augmenting; that is, if NG and GK are equal,
HL ſhall either be equal to OH or greater. Here,
ſince IM × QT is = AK × HL + CH × GK,
and IP × QT = AN × HO + CH × GN,
where CH × GK is = CH × GN and AK × HL
in both caſes greater than AN × HO, IM will
be greater than IP; in ſo much that in both theſe
caſes the velocity of the point, wherewith the line
EF is deſcribed, win have to velocity of the
point moving on AB a proportion, gradually
augmenting. Here therefore the line IM will bear to
GK a greater proportion, than the velocity of the
point moving on the line EF, when at I,
bears to the velocity of the point moving on the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0218900500:18"/>
line AB, when at G: and the line PI will have a
leſs proportion to NG, than the velocity, which
the point moving on the line EF, has at I, to the
velocity, which the point moving on the line AB has at G.</p>
               <p>NOW let R be to S as the velocity, which the
point moving on AB has at G, to the velocity,
which the point moving on CD has at H; then I
ſay, that the velocity, which the point moving on
EF has at I, will be to the velocity, which the
point moving on AB has at G, as AG × S
+ CH × R to QT × R.<figure/>
               </p>
               <p>IF poſſible let the velocity, which the point moving
on EF has at I, be to the velocity, which the point
moving on AB has at G, as AG × S + CH × R to

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0218900500:19"/>
TAKE W to GK in the ratio of S to R; then
will AG × S + CH × R be to R × QV as AG × W
+ CH × GK to QV × GK. Here, becauſe the ratio
of the velocity of the point moving on the line CD to
the velocity of the point moving on AB either remains
conſtantly the ſame, or gradually augments, W is
either equal to HL or leſs; but when it is leſs, by
diminiſhing HL the ratio of W to HL may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
greater than any ratio, that can be propoſed,
ſhort of the ratio of equality. The like is true of
die ratio of AG to AK by the diminution of
GK. Therefore let GK and HL be ſo diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the ratio of AG × W to AK × HL ſhall
be greater than the ratio of QV to QT; then the
ratio of AG × W + CH × GK to AK × HL
+ CH × GK, that is, to QT × IM is greater
than the ratio of QV to QT or of QV × IM to
QT × IM; therefore AG × W + CH × GK is
greater than QV × IM; and the ratio of AG × W
+ CH × GK to QV × GK is greater than the
ratio of QV × IM to QV × GK, or of IM to
GK; but the ratio of IM to GK is greater than
that of the velocity, which the point moving on EF
has at I, to the velocity, which the point moving
on AB has at G; therefore the ratio of AG × W
+ CH × GK to QV × GK, or that of AG × S

of the velocity at I to the velocity at G; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the ratio of the velocity at I to the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

               <p>AGAIN, if poſſible let the velocity, which the
point moving on EF has at I, be to the velocity,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0218900500:20"/>
which the point moving on AB has at G, as
AG × S + CH × R to the rectangle under R and
ſome line QX greater than QT.</p>
               <p>HERE let Y be to NG as S to R; then will
AG × S + CH × R be to R × QX as AG × Y
+ CH × NG to QX × NG. But Y will be either
greater than HO, or equal to it, and when greater,
by diminishing HO, the ratio of Y to HO may
become leſs than any ratio, that can be propoſed,
greater than the ratio of equality. The like is
<figure/>
true of the ratio of AG to AN by the diminution
of NG. Therefore let NG and HO be ſo dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
that the ratio of AG × Y to AN × HO ſhall
be leſs than the ratio of QX to QT; then the
ratio of AG × Y + CH × NG to AN × HO
+ CH × NG, that is, to QT × IP, is leſs than the
ratio of QX to QT, or of QX × IP to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0218900500:21"/>
QT × IP. Conſequently AG × Y + CH × NG
is leſs than QX × IP, and the ratio of AG × Y
+ CH × NG to QX × NG is leſs than the ratio
of QX × IP to QX × NG, or of IP to NG. But
the ratio of IP to NG is leſs than that of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
which the point moving on EF has at I, to
the velocity, which the Point moving on AB has
at G. Therefore the ratio of AG × Y + CH × NG
to QX × NG, or that of AG × S + CH × R to
QX × R, is alſo leſs than the ratio of the velocity
at I to the velocity at G. Conſequently, the ratio
of the velocity at I to the velocity at G is not
leſs than that of AG × S + CH × R to QT × R.</p>
               <p>If the points deſcribing AB and CD move
backwards together, the velocity at I will be the
ſame, and the demonſtration will proceed in like
manner.</p>
               <p>BUT if one of the points, as that moving on
CD, recedes, while the other on AB advances for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
take in CD any fix'd point at pleaſure Z;
then the point on CD in reſpect of Z moves alſo
forward. Again, take in the line EF, EΓ to AG
as CZ to QT; then AG × CZ is = QT × EΓ;
and AG × CH being = QT × EI, AG × HZ
will be = QT × ΓI; and by the preceeding caſe
AG × S + ZH × R will be to QT × R as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
wherewith the point moving on EF ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
from Γ, when at I, to the velocity, which
the point moving on AB has at G. But as AG
is continually increaſing, and EΓ keeps always in
the ſame proportion to AG; the point Γ will it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
be in motion, and the velocity of the point Γ
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0218900500:22"/>
will be to the velocity at G, as the line EΓ to
AG, that is, as CZ to QT, or as CZ × R to
QT × R; therefore the velocity, wherewith the
point moving on EF, when at I, ſeparates from Γ,
being to the velocity of the point moving on AB,
when at G, as AG × S + ZH × R to QT × R;
the abſolute velocity, which the point moving on

the point moving on AB has at G, as AG × S
∽ CH × R to QT × R; moving backwards, when
<figure/>
it ſeparates from Γ ſwifter than the point Γ itſelf
moves, that is, when AG × S + ZH × R is greater
than CZ × R, or AG × S greater than CH × R;
and when the point moving on EF, at I ſeparates
from Γ with a ſlower motion, than that wherewith
Γ moves, that is, when CZ × R is greater than
AG × S + ZH × R, or AG × S leſs than CH × R,
the point moving on EF, at I advances forward.</p>

ſuperficial or ſolid, are analogous to the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
wherewith lines are deſcribed, that augment
in the ſame proportion with ſuch ſpaces.</p>
               <p>THUS we have attempted to prove the truth
of the rules, Sir Iſaac Newton has laid down, for
finding the fluxions of quantities, by demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the two caſes, on which all the reſt depend, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a method, which from all antiquity has been
allowed as genuine, and univerſally acknowledged
to be free from the leaſt ſhadow of uncertainty.</p>
               <p>WE ſhall hereafter endeavour to make manifeſt,
that Sir Iſaac Newton's own demonſtrations are
equally juſt with theſe, we have here exhibited.
But firſt we ſhall prove, that in all the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this doctrine to the ſolution of geometrical
problems, no other conception concerning fluxions
is neceſſary, than what we have here given. And
for this end it will be ſufficient to ſhew, how fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are to be applied to the drawing of tangents to
curve lines, and to the menſuration of curvilinear
ſpaces.</p>
               <p>IF upon the line AB be erected in any angle ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtreight line AC, and it be put in motion
upon the line AB towards B keeping always pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0218900500:24"/>
to itſelf, and proceeding on with a uniform
velocity: if
a point alſo
moves on the
line AC with
a velocity in
any manner
regulated;
<figure/>this point
will deſcribe within the angle under CAB ſome third line DE,
which will be a curve, unleſs the point moves in the
line AC likewiſe with a uniform motion.</p>
               <p>HERE, I ſay, the line AC being advanced to
any ſituation FG, by what has already been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
on the nature of fluxions, without any adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
conſideration whatever, a tangent may be
aſſigned to the curve at the point G.</p>
               <p>WHEN the point moves on the line AC with
an accelerating velocity, the curve DE will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex
to the abſciſſe DB. Now if two other ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
HI and KL of the line AC be taken, one
on each ſide FG, and MGN be drawn parallel to
AB; while the line AC is moving from the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
HI to FG, the point in it will have moved
through the length IM, and while the ſame line
AC moves from FG to KL, the point in it will
have paſſed over the length NL. And ſince the
point moves with an accelerated velocity, IM will
be leſs, and NL greater than the ſpace, which
would have been deſcribed in the ſame time by the
velocity, the point has at G.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0218900500:25"/>
LET FO be taken to FG in the proportion of
the velocity, wherewith the point F moves on the
line AB, <figure/>to the
velocity, which
the point mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the line
FP has at G,
and the ſtreight
line OGQ be
drawn, cutting HI in R, and KL in S; then FH will be to
MR, and FK to NS in the ſame proportion.
Therefore, from what has been ſaid above, MR
will be greater than MI, and NS leſs than NL;
ſo that the line OQ, which unites with the curve
at the point G, lies on both ſides the point G, on
the ſame ſide of the curve; that is, it does not
croſs, or cut the curve (as geometers ſpeak) but
touches it only at the point G.</p>
               <p>WHEN the point moves on the line AC with
a velocity gradually decreaſing, the curve will be
concave towards the abſciſſe; but in this caſe the
method of reaſoning will be ſtill the ſame.</p>
               <p>IF the curve DE be the conical parabola, the
latus rectum being T, and T × FG = DF<hi>q,</hi> or
FG = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

fluxion of <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (that is, the fluxion of FG) as
T to 2DF; therefore OF is to FG in the ſame
proportion of T to 2DF, or of DF to 2FG,
and OF is half DF.</p>

IN like manner by the conſideration of theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities
only may the menſuration of curvilinear
ſpaces be effected.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE the curvilinear ſpace ABC to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by the parallel motion of the line BC upon the
line AD with a uniform velocity, within the ſpace
comprehended between the ſtreight line AD and
<figure/>
the curve line AZ; and let the parallelogram
AEFB be generated with it by the motion of
BF accompanying BC. Suppoſe another paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram</p>

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0218900500:27"/>
GHIK to be generated at the ſame time by
the motion of the line GH equal to AE or BF, inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the line GL in an angle equal to that under
CBD; and let the motion of GH be ſo regulated, that
the parallelogram GHIK be always equal to the
curvilinear ſpace ABC. Then it is evident, by
what has been ſaid above in our explanation of the
nature of fluxions, that the velocity, wherewith
the parallelogram EABF increaſes, is to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
wherewith the parallelogram GHIK, or
wherewith the curvilinear ſpace ABC increaſes;
as the velocity, wherewith the point B moves, to
the velocity, wherewith the point K moves.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, the velocity of the point B is to
the velocity of the point K as BF to BC.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE the curve line ACZ to recede far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and farther from AD; then it is evident, that
while the parallelogram EABF augments uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the curvilinear ſpace ABC will increaſe faſter
and faſter; therefore in this caſe the point K moves
with a velocity continually accelerated.</p>
               <p>HERE, if poſſible, ſuppoſe the velocity of the
point B to bear a leſs proportion to the velocity of the
point K, than the ratio of BF to BC; that is, let
the velocity of B be to the velocity of K, as BF to
ſome line M greater than BC. Then it is poſſible to
draw within the curve ACZ towards D a line, as
ON, parallel to BC, which, though it exceed BC,
ſhall be leſs than M; and will the ratio of the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the point B to the velocity of the Point K,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0218900500:28"/>
be leſs than the ratio of BF to NO, or than the
ratio of the parallelogram BP to the parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram
BO; therefore ſtill leſs than the ratio of the
parallelogram BP to the ſpace BCON. Farther
let the parallelogram KIRQ be taken equal to the
ſpace BCON, then will the point K have moved
from K to Q in the time, that the point B has
<figure/>
moved from B to N. Now the parallelogram BP
is to the parallelogram KR as BN to KQ, that is,
as the velocity, wherewith the point B paſſes over
BN, to the velocity, wherewith KQ would be
deſcribed in the ſame time with a uniform motion.
But as the point K moves with a velocity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0218900500:29"/>
accelerated, its velocity at K is leſs than
this uniform velocity now ſpoken of; therefore the
velocity of the point B bears a greater proportion
to the velocity of the point K than the parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram
BP bears to the parallelogram KR; that is,
than the parallelogram BP bears to the ſpace BCON;
but the firſt of theſe ratios was before found leſs than
the laſt; which involves an abſurdity. Therefore
the velocity of B bears not to the velocity of K a
leſs proportion than that of BF to BC.<figure/>
               </p>
               <p>AGAIN, if poſſible, let the velocity of B bear
to the velocity of K a greater proportion than that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0218900500:30"/>
of BF to BC, that is, the proportion of BF to
ſome line S leſs than BC; and let the line TV be
drawn parallel to CB, and greater than S, and the
parallelogram TB be compleated. Here the ratio
of the velocity of the point B to the velocity of the
Point K will be greater than the ratio of BF to
TV, or than the ratio of the parallelogram BW
to the parallelogram BT, therefore ſtill greater
than the ratio of the parallelogram BW to the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilinear
ſpace VTCB. Now if the parallelogram
XYIK be taken equal to the ſpace VTCB, that
the point deſcribing the line GL may have moved
from X to K, while VT has moved to BC; ſince
the parallelogram BW is to the parallelogram XI
as VB to XK, that is, as the velocity, wherewith
the point B has paſſed over VB, to the velocity,
wherewith XK would be deſcribed in the ſame time
with a uniform motion, the velocity of the point
B bears a leſs proportion to the velocity of the point
K, than the parallelogram BW bears to the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram
XI, becauſe XK is deſcribed with an
accelerating velocity: that is, the velocity of the
point B bears a leſs proportion to the velocity of the
point K, than the parallelogram BW bears to the
ſpace VTCB. But the firſt of thoſe ratios was
before found greater than the laſt. Therefore the
velocity of B does not bear to the velocity of K a
greater proportion than that of BF to BC.</p>
               <p>IF the curve line ACZ were of any other form,
the demonſtration would ſtill proceed in the ſame manner.</p>

HENCE it appears, that nothing more is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
towards the menſuration of the curvilinear ſpace
ABC, than to find a line GK ſo related to AB,
that, while they are deſcribed together, the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the point, wherewith AB is deſcribed, ſhall
bear the ſame proportion at any place B to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
wherewith the point deſcribing the other
line GK moves at the correſpondent place K, as
ſome given line AE bears to the ordinate BC of
the curve ACZ.</p>
               <p>THE method of finding ſuch lines is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Sir Iſaac Newton's Treatiſe upon the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drature
of Curves.</p>
               <p>FOR example, if ACZ be a conical parabola
as before, and Γ × BC = AB<hi>q</hi>; taking GK =
<gap reason="math">

                  </gap>, =

being equal to <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the fluxion of GK or
the velocity, wherewith it is deſcribed at K, will be
to the fluxion of AB, or the velocity, wherewith B moves, as <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or BC to GH or AE.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus, as we conceive, ſufficiently
explained, what relates to the proportions between
the velocities, wherewith magnitudes are generated;
nothing now remains, before we proceed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of our preſent deſign, but to conſider
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0218900500:32"/>
the variations, to which theſe velocities are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>WHEN fluents are not augmented by a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
velocity, it is convenient in many problems
to conſider how theſe velocities vary This varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Sir Iſaac Newton calls the fluxion of the fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and alſo the ſecond fluxion of the fluent; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
the fluxions, we have hitherto treated
of, by the name of the firſt fluxions. Theſe ſecond
fluxions may alſo vary in different magnitudes of
the fluent, and the variation of theſe is called the third fluxion of
the fluent. Fourth fluxions are the
changes to which the third are ſubject, and ſo
on <note n="*" place="bottom">Fluxionum (ſcilicet primarum) fluxiones ſeu mutationes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis aut minus celeres fluxiones ſecundas nominare licet, &amp;c. Newt. Quadr. Curv. in Princip.</note>.</p>
               <p>IN the two fluents AE and CF, whoſe fluxions
we compared at page 7, &amp;c. where AE being deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>x,</hi> CF was equal to
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the
fluxion of AE bore to the fluxion of CF the proportion of <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
to <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <figure/>Here it is evident, that the antecedent
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of this proportion being a fix'd quantity, and
the conſequent <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a variable one; the fluxion
of AE does not bear to the fluxion of CF always
the ſame proportion. If <hi>n</hi> be the number 2, the
fluxion of AE is to the fluxion of CF as <hi>a</hi> to the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0218900500:33"/>
variable quantity 2<hi>x</hi>; and if <hi>n</hi> be the number 3,
the fluxion of AE to that of CF will be as <hi>a2</hi> to
3<hi>x2</hi>. Therefore if AE be deſcribed with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
velocity, when <hi>n</hi> is any number greater than
unite, CF is ſo deſcribed with a velocity continually
accelerating, that when <hi>n</hi> is = 2, this velocity aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the ſame proportion as CF itſelf increaſes;
and when <hi>n</hi> is = 3, it augments in the duplicate of
that proportion, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>HERE therefore we ſee, that while one quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
flows uniformly, the other is deſcribed with a
varying motion; and the variation in this motion
is called the ſecond fluxion of this quantity.</p>
               <p>IT is evident farther, that in this inſtance, when
<hi>n</hi> is = 2, the variation of the velocity is uniform:
for the velocity keeping always in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>x,</hi> while <hi>x</hi> increaſes uniformly, the velocity
muſt alſo increaſe after the ſame manner. But when <hi>n</hi>
is = 3; ſince the velocity is every where as <hi>x2</hi>, and <hi>x2</hi>
does not increaſe uniformly; neither will the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
augment uniformly. So that it appears by this
example, that the variation in the velocity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
magnitudes increaſe, may alſo vary, and this
variation is called the third fluxion of the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>IN the ſame manner may the fluxions of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
orders be conceived; each order being the
variation found in the preceeding one. And the
conſideration of velocities thus perpetually varying,
and their variation itſelf changing, is a uſeful ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation;
for moſt, if not all, the bodies, we have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0218900500:34"/>
any acquaintance with, do actually move with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities
thus modified.</p>
               <p>A STONE, for inſtance, in its direct fall towards
the earth has its velocity perpetually augmented;
and in Galileo's Theory of falling Bodies, when
the whole deſcent is performed near the ſurface of
the earth, it is ſuppoſed to receive equal augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of velocity in equal times. In this caſe
therefore the velocity augments uniformly, and the
ſecond fluxion of the line deſcribed by the falling bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
will in all parts of that line be the ſame; ſo that
third fluxions cannot take place in this inſtance;
ſince the variation of the velocity ſuffers no change,
but is every where uniform.</p>
               <p>BUT if the ſtone be ſuppoſed to have its gravity
at the beginning of its fall leſs than at the ſurface
of the earth, the variation of its velocity at firſt
will then be leſs than the variation at the end of
its motion; or in other words, the ſecond fluxions
in the beginning and end of its fall would be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual;
conſequently, third fluxions would here take
place, ſince the variation would be ſwifter, as the
body in its fall approached the earth.</p>
               <p>THE ſtone in this laſt inſtance then not only
moves with a velocity perpetually varying, as in
the preceeding example, but this variation conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
changes. In the true theory of falling bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
neither this laſt variation nor any ſubſequent
one can ever be uniform; ſo that fluxions of every
order do here actually exiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0218900500:35"/>
THE ſame is true of the motion of the planets
in their elliptic orbs; of the motion of light at the
confines of different mediums, and of the motion
of all pendulous bodies.</p>
               <p>IN ſhort, an uniform unchangeable velocity is
not to be met with in any of thoſe bodies, that
fall under our cogniſance; for in order to continue
ſuch a motion as this, it is neceſſary, that they
ſhould not be diſturbed by any force whatever, either
of impulſe or reſiſtance; but we know of no ſpaces,
in which at leaſt one of theſe cauſes of variation
does not operate.</p>

the ſame analogy to the firſt fluxion of any
magnitude; then the velocity, wherewith this line
is deſcribed, that is, the fluxion of this line, will
be analogous to the ſecond fluxion of the aforeſaid
magnitude. For it is evident, that this line will
perpetually alter in magnitude in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the fluxion, to which it is analogous, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>

fluxion at any
other point D, <figure/>by
cauſing the line EF to be deſcribed by the motion
of a point, ſo as to keep always the ſame analogy to
the firſt fluxion of the fluent AB. Suppoſe EG
be to EH, as the firſt fluxion at C to the firſt
fluxion at D; then the ſecond fluxion at C will be
to the ſecond fluxion at D, as the firſt fluxion of the
line EF at G, to the firſt fluxion of the ſame at H.</p>
               <p>IN like manner, if another fluent IK be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

firſt fluxion of AB. Suppoſe MO to be to EG,
as the firſt fluxion of IK at L to the firſt fluxion

In the ſame manner if a line be deſcribed ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous

in ſuch manner, that the point D, moving upon

to the velocity of the point C; the point F at the

as the velocity of the point O to that of F; I ſay,
that if the velocity of the point C has to the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

of D to that of N will be in the duplicate of

to that of P in the quadruplicate of that proportion,
and ſo on in the ſame order, as far as theſe ſeries of
lines are extended.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE the velocity of the point C be always
to the velocity of the point M, as the line T to the
line V, when theſe points are at equal diſtances
from A and K. Then, ſince the times, in which
equal lines are deſcribed, are reciprocally as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities

AC receives any additional increment, will be to

which QN ſhall receive; while the lines

the velocity of the point D to that of the point N

               <p>AGAIN, the velocity of D being to the velocity
of N, when AC and KM are equal, always in the
ſame duplicate ratio of T to V, and GF being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<figure/>
to RO as the velocity of the point D to the
velocity of the point N, the variation, by increaſe
or diminution, of the line GF to the like variation
of RO, while AC and KM receive equal aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
will alſo be as the velocity of D to the
velocity of N, that is in the duplicate ratio of T to V.
But the time, in which the line GF receives its
variation, will be to the time, in which RO re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
its variation, as V to T. Hence the velocity
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0218900500:40"/>
of the point F will be to the velocity of the point
O in the triplicate ratio of T to V.</p>
               <p>AFTER the ſame manner, the velocity of the
point I will appear to have to the velocity of the
point P the quadruplicate of the ratio of T to V.</p>
               <p>BUT from what we have ſaid above, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the velocity of the point D is to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of the point N, as the ſecond fluxion of AC
to the ſecond fluxion of KM; the velocity of the
point F to the velocity of the point O, as the
third fluxion of AC to the third fluxion of KM;
and the velocity of the point I to the velocity of
the point P, as the fourth fluxion of AC to the
fourth fluxion of KM. And hence appears the
truth of Sir Iſaac Newton's obſervation at the end of
the firſt propoſition of his book of Quadratures, that
a ſecond fluxion, and the ſecond power of a firſt
fluxion, or the product under two firſt fluxions; a
third fluxion, and the third power of a firſt, or
the product under a firſt and ſecond, and ſo on;
are homologous terms in any equation. For, as it
appears by this propoſition, that if the velocity,
wherewith any fluent is augmented, be in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
increaſed; its ſecond fluxion will increaſe
in the duplicate of that proportion, the third fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the triplicate, and the fourth fluxion in the
quadruplicate of that ſame proportion; it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that the terms in any equation, that ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
a ſecond fluxion, will preſerve always the
ſame proportion to the terms involving the ſecond
power of a firſt fluxion, or the product of two firſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0218900500:41"/>
fluxions; the terms involving a third fluxion will
preſerve the ſame proportion to the terms invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the third power of a firſt, or the product of a
firſt and ſecond, or the product of three firſt fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and the terms containing a fourth fluxion will
keep the ſame proportion to the terms containing
the fourth power of a firſt, the product of a ſecond
and the ſecond power of a firſt, the ſecond power
of a ſecond, or the product of a firſt and third; &amp;c.
however be increaſed or diminiſhed the firſt fluxion,
or the velocity, wherewith the fluents augment.</p>
               <p>IN the problems concerning curve lines, which
relate to the degree of curvature in any point of
thoſe curves, or to the variation of their curvature
in different parts, theſe ſuperior orders of fluxions
are uſeful; for by the inflexion of the curve, whilſt
its abſciſſe flows uniformly, the fluxion of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
muſt continually vary, and thereby will be
attended with theſe ſuperior orders of fluxions.</p>
               <p>FOR example, were it required to compare the
different degrees of curvature either of different
curves, or of the ſame curve in different parts, and
in order thereto a circle ſhould be ſought, whoſe
degree of curvature might be the ſame with that
of any curve propoſed, in any point, that ſhould
be aſſigned; ſuch a circle may be found by the
help of ſecond fluxions. When the abſciſſes of
two curves flow with equal velocity; where the
ordinates have equal firſt fluxions, the tangent;
make equal angles with their reſpective ordinates.
If now the ſecond fluxions of theſe ordinates are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
equal, the curves in thoſe points muſt be equally
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0218900500:42"/>
deflected from their tangents, that is, have equal
degrees of curvature. Upon this principle ſuch
circles, as have here been mentioned, may be found
by the following method.</p>
               <p>THE curve ABC being given, let it be required
to find a circle equally incurvated with this curve at
the point B. Suppoſe EFG to be this circle, in which
the tangent FH at the point F makes with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
FI the ſame angle, as the tangent BK, drawn
to the other curve ABC at the point B, makes with
<figure/>
the ordinate BL of that curve. Now if the two ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciſſes
AL and EI are deſcribed with equal veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the firſt fluxion of the ordinates LB and IF will
be equal; and therefore, if the two curves are equally
incurvated at the points B and F, the ſecond fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of theſe ordinates will be alſo equal. If M be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0218900500:43"/>
the center of the circle EFG, and ME be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>a</hi> and MI by <hi>x,</hi> IF will be = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
and, by the rules for finding fluxions, the firſt
fluxion of IF will be to the fluxion of MI, or of
<hi>x,</hi> as <hi>x</hi> to <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe the line NO to be ſo deſcribed,
that the fluxion of MI, or of <hi>x,</hi> ſhall be to the
firſt fluxion of IF, as ſome given line <hi>e</hi> to NP in
the line NO, then will NP be = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Suppoſe likewiſe the lines QR to be ſo deſcribed,
that the fluxion of AL in the curve ABC ſhall be
to the firſt fluxion of LB, as the ſame given line <hi>e</hi>
to QS in the line QR. Here the firſt fluxions
of IF and LB being equal, NP and QS are equal.
And ſince the ſecond fluxions of IF and LB are
equal, the fluxions of NP and QS are alſo equal.
But NP was = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and by the rules for

fluxion of MI as <hi>eaa</hi> to <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, as
<hi>e</hi> × EM<hi>q</hi> to IF<hi>c.</hi> Therefore in the curve ABC
the fluxion of QS to the fluxion of AL will be in
the ſame proportion of <hi>e</hi> × EM<hi>q</hi> to IF<hi>c.</hi> Hence
by finding firſt QS, then its fluxion, from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation
expreſſing the nature of the curve ABC, the
proportion of <hi>e</hi> × EM<hi>q</hi> to IF <hi>c</hi> will be given. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the proportion of <hi>e</hi> to IF will be alſo
given, becauſe the ratio of EM<hi>q</hi> to IF <hi>q</hi> is the
ſame with the given ratio of HF<hi>q</hi> to HI<hi>q,</hi> or of
KB<hi>q</hi> to KL<hi>q.</hi> And hereby the circle EFG will
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0218900500:44"/>
be given, whoſe curvature is equal to the curvature
of the curve ABC at the point B.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE the curve ABC to be the conical pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabola,
where AL<hi>q</hi> ſhall be equal to γ × LB, γ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the latus rectum of the axis. Here <hi>e</hi> will be to
QS as γ to 2 AL; for that is the ratio of the fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of AL to the fluxion of BL: therefore QS is
<figure/>
= <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> AL, and conſequently the fluxion of QS
to the fluxion of AL (that is <hi>e</hi> × EM<hi>q</hi> to IF<hi>c</hi>)
as 2<hi>e</hi> to γ, or as 2 <hi>e</hi> × EM<hi>q</hi> to γ × EM<hi>q</hi>; in
ſo much that IF<hi>c</hi> is = ½ γ × EM<hi>q,</hi> and the given
ratio of IF<hi>q</hi> to EM<hi>q</hi> (namely the ratio of KL<hi>q</hi>
to KB<hi>q</hi>) is the ſame with the ratio of ½ γ to IF:
that is, IF is equal to half the latus rectum apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0218900500:45"/>
to the diameter of the parabola, whoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex
is the point B.</p>
               <p>THIS is all we think neceſſary towards giving
a juſt and clear idea of the nature of fluxions,
and for proving the certainty of the deductions
made from them. For it muſt now be manifeſt to
every reader, that mathematical quantities become
the proper object of this doctrine of fluxions, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are ſuppoſed to increaſe by any continued
motion of prolongation, dilatation, expanſion or
other kind of augmentation, provided ſuch augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
be directed by ſome general rule, whence
the meaſure of the increaſe of theſe quantities may
from time to time be eſtimated. And when different
homogeneous magnitudes increaſe after this manner
together, one may vary faſter than another. Now
the velocity of increaſe in each quantity, is the
fluxion of that quantity. This is the true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of Sir Iſaac Newton's appellation of fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Incrementorum velocitates. For this doctrine
does not ſuppoſe the fluents themſelves to have
any motion. Fluxions are not the velocities, with
which the fluents, or even the increments, which
thoſe fluents receive, are themſelves moved; but
the degrees of velocity, wherewith thoſe increments
are generated. Subjects incapable of local motion,
ſuch as fluxions themſelves, may alſo have their
fluxions. In this we do not aſcribe to theſe fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
any actual motion; for to aſcribe motion, or
velocity to what is itſelf only a, velocity, would
be wholly unintelligible. The fluxion of another
fluxion is only a variation in the velocity, which is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0218900500:46"/>
that fluxion. In ſhort, light, heat, ſound, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of bodies, the power of gravity, and whatever
elſe is capable of variation, and of having that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
aſſigned, for this reaſon comes under the
preſent doctrine; nothing more being underſtood
by the fluxion of any ſubject, than the degree of
ſuch its variation.</p>
               <p>TO aſſign the velocities of variation or increaſe
in different homogeneous quantities, it is neceſſary
to compare the degrees of augmentation, which thoſe
quantities receive in equal portions of time; and in
this doctrine of fluxions no farther uſe is made of
ſuch increments: for the application of this doctrine
to geometrical problems depends upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of theſe velocities only. But the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the increments themſelves may be made
ſubſervient to the like uſes upon other principles;
the explanation of which leads us to the ſecond part
of our deſign.</p>

               <head>OF PRIME and ULTIMATE RATIOS.</head>
               <p>THE primary method of comparing together
the magnitudes of rectilinear ſpaces is by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them one upon another: thus all the right lined
ſpaces, which in the firſt book of Euclide are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be equal, are the ſum or difference of ſuch
ſpaces, as would cover one another. This method
cannot be applied in comparing curvilinear ſpaces
with rectilinear ones; becauſe no part whatever of
a curve line can be laid upon a ſtreight line, ſo as
wholly to coincide with it. For this purpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ancient geometers made uſe of a method
of reaſoning, ſince commonly called the method of
exhauſtions; which conſiſts in deſcribing upon the
curvilinear ſpace a rectilinear one, which though not
equal to the other, yet might differ leſs from it
than by any the moſt minute difference whatever,
that ſhould be propoſed; and thereby proving, the
two ſpaces, they would compare, could be neither
greater nor leſs than each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0218900500:48"/>
FOR example, in order to prove the equality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſpace comprehended within the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of a circle, and a triangle, whoſe baſe ſhould
be equal to the circumference of that circle, and
its altitude to the ſemidiameter, Archimedes takes this
method. About the circle he deſcribes a polygon
as ABC, and makes it appear, that by multiplying
the ſides of this polygon, there may at length be
<figure/>
deſcribed ſuch an one, as ſhall exceed the circle leſs
than by any difference, that ſhall be propoſed, how
minute ſoever that difference be. By this means it
was eaſy to prove, that the triangle DEF, whoſe
baſe EF ſhould be equal to the circumference of
the circle, and altitude ED equal to the ſemidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
is not greater than the circle. For were it
greater, how ſmall ſoever be the exceſs, it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to deſcribe about the circle a polygon leſs than
the triangle; but the circumference of the polygon
is greater than the circumference of the circle, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the polygon can never be leſs, but muſt be
always greater than the triangle; for the polygon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0218900500:49"/>
is equal to a triangle, whoſe altitude is the ſemidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the circle, and baſe equal to the circumference
of the polygon. It appears therefore impoſſible for
the triangle DEF to be greater than the circle.</p>
               <p>THUS far Archimedes makes uſe of the polygon
circumſcribing the circle and no farther: but inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
another within the circle he proves, by a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<figure/>
proceſs of reaſoning, that it is impoſſible for the
triangle to be leſs than the circle; whereby at
length it becomes certain, that the triangle DEF
is neither greater nor leſs than the circle, but equal
to it.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, the triangle may be proved not to
be leſs than the circle by the circumſcribed polygon
alſo. For were it leſs, another triangle DEG,
whoſe baſe EG is greater than EF, might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
which ſhould not be greater than the circle.
But a polygon can be circumſcribed about the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
the circumference of which ſhall exceed the
circumference of the circle by leſs than any line, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0218900500:50"/>
can be named, conſequently by leſs than FG, that
is, the circumference of the polygon ſhall be leſs than
EG, and the polygon leſs than the triangle DEG;
therefore it is impoſſible, that this triangle ſhould
not exceed the circle, ſince it is greater than the
polygon: conſequently the triangle DEF cannot be leſs than the circle.</p>
               <p>THUS the circle and triangle may be proved
to be equal by comparing them with one polygon
only, and Sir Iſaac Newton has inſtituted upon
this principle a briefer method of conception and
expreſſion for demonſtrating this ſort of propoſitions,
than what was uſed by the ancients; and his ideas
are equally diſtinct, and adequate to the ſubject,
with theirs, though more complex. It became the
firſt writers to chooſe the moſt ſimple form of
expreſſion, and the leaſt compounded ideas poſſible.
But Sir Iſaac Newton thought, he ſhould oblige
the mathematicians by uſing brevity, provided he
introduced no modes of conception difficult to be
comprehended by thoſe, who are not unſkilled in
the ancient methods of writing.</p>
               <p>THE conciſe form, into which Sir Iſaac New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
has caſt his demonſtrations, may very poſſibly
create a difficulty of apprehenſion in the minds of
ſome unexerciſed in theſe ſubjects. But otherwiſe
his method of demonſtrating by the prime and
ultimate ratios of varying magnitudes is not only
juſt, and free from any defect in itſelf; but eaſily
to be comprehended, at leaſt by thoſe who have
made theſe ſubjects familiar to them by reading the
ancients.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0218900500:51"/>
IN this method any fix'd quantity, which ſome
varying quantity, by a continual augmentation
or diminution, ſhall prepetually approach, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
paſs, is conſidered as the quantity, to which
the varying quantity will at laſt or ultimately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
equal; provided the varying quantity can be
made in its approach to the other to differ from
it by leſs than by any quantity how minute ſoever,
that can be aſſigned <note n="*" place="bottom">Princ. Philoſ. Lib. I. Lern. 1.</note>.</p>
               <p>UPON this principle the equality between the
fore-mentioned circle and triangle DEF is at once
deducible. For ſince the polygon circumſcribing
the circle approaches to each according to all the
conditions above ſet down, this polygon is to be
conſidered as ultimately becoming equal to both,
and conſequently they muſt be eſteemed equal to
each other.</p>
               <p>THAT this is a juſt concluſion, is moſt evident.
For if either of theſe magnitudes be ſuppoſed leſs
than the other, this polygon could not approach
to the leaſt within ſome aſſignable diſtance.</p>
               <p>RATIOS alſo may ſo vary, as to be confined
after the ſame manner to ſome determined limit,
and ſuch limit of any ratio is here conſidered as that,
with which the varying ratio will ultimately coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide <note n="**" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0218900500:52"/>
FROM any ratio's having ſuch a limit, it does
not follow, that the variable quantities exhibiting
that ratio have any final magnitude, or even limit,
which they cannot paſs.</p>
               <p>FOR ſuppoſe two magnitudes, B and B + A,
whoſe difference ſhall be A, are each of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
increaſing by equal degrees. It is evident,
that if A remains unchanged, the proportion of
B + A to B is a proportion, that tends nearer and
nearer to the proportion of equality, as B becomes
larger; it is alſo evident, that the proportion of
B + A to B may, by taking B of a ſufficient mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
be brought at laſt nearer to the proportion
of equality, than to any other aſſignable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and conſequently the ratio of equality is to be
conſidered as the ultimate ratio of B + A to B.
The ultimate proportion then of theſe quantities is
here aſſigned, though the quantities themſelves
have no final magnitude.</p>
               <p>THE ſame holds true in decreaſing quantities.</p>
               <p>THE quadrilateral ABCD bears to the quadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
EBCF the proportion of AB + DC to
BE + CF, provided the two lines AE and DF are
parallel. Now if the line DF be drawn nearer to
AE, this proportion of AB + DC to BE + CF
will not remain the ſame, unleſs the lines DA,
CB, FE produced will meet in the ſame point;
and this proportion, by diminiſhing the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0218900500:53"/>
DF and AE may at laſt be brought nearer
to the proportion of AB
to BE, than to any other
whatever. <figure/>Therefore the
proportion of AB to BE
is to be conſidered as the
ultimate proportion of
AB+DC to BE+CF,
or as the ultimate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the quadrilateral ABCD to the quadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
EBCF.</p>
               <p>HERE theſe quadrilaterals can never bear one
to the other the proportion between AB and BE,
nor have either of them any final magnitude, or
even ſo much as a limit, but by the diminution of
the diſtance between DF and AE they diminiſh
continually without end: and the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
AB and BE is for this reaſon called the
ultimate proportion of the two quadrilaterals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is the proportion, which thoſe quadrila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terals
can never actually have to each other, but
the limit of that proportion.</p>
               <p>THE quadrilaterals may be continually dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
either by dividing BC in any known propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in G drawing HGI parallel to AE, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
again BG in the like manner, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
this diviſion without end; or elſe the line
DF may be ſuppoſed to advance towards AE
with an uninterrupted motion, 'till the quadrila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terals
quite diſappear, or vaniſh. And under this
latter notion theſe quadrilaterals may very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0218900500:54"/>
be called vaniſhing quantities, ſince they are now
conſidered, as never having any ſtable magnitude,
but decreaſing by a continued motion, 'till they come
to nothing. And ſince the ratio of the quadrila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
ABCD to the quadrilateral BEFC, while
the quadrilaterals diminiſh, approaches to that of
AB to BE in ſuch manner, that this ratio of AB
to BE is the neareſt limit, that can be aſſigned to
the other; it is by no means a forced conception to
conſider the ratio of AB to BE under the notion
of the ratio, wherewith the quadrilaterals vaniſh;
and this ratio may properly be called the ultimate
ratio of two vaniſhing quantities.</p>
               <p>THE reader will perceive, I am endeavouring
to explain Sir Iſaac Newton's expreſſion Ratio ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
quantitatum evaneſcentium; and I have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Latin participle evaneſcens, by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
one vaniſhing, and not by the word evaneſcent,
which having the form of a noun adjective, does
not ſo certainly imply that motion, which ought
here to be kept carefully in mind. The quadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterals
ABCD, BEFC become vaniſhing quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
from the time, we firſt aſcribe to them this
perpetual diminution; that is, from that time they
are quantities going to vaniſh. And as during their
diminution they have continually different propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to each other; ſo the ratio between AB and
BE is not to be called merely Ratio harum quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titatum
evaneſcentium, but Ultima ratio <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Princ. Philoſ. pag. 37. 38.</note>.</p>

SHOULD we ſuppoſe the line DF firſt to coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide

this conception the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio

very juſtly be conſidered
as the ratio, wherewith
the quadrilaterals by this

this ratio may alſo properly be called the firſt or

               <p>HERE I have attempted to explain in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the phraſe Ratio prima quantitatum naſcentium;
but no Engliſh participle occuring to me, whereby
to render the word naſcens, I have been obliged
to uſe circumlocution. Under the preſent concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the quadrilaterals they are to be called naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes,
not only at the very inſtant of their firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,

participles are uſed in common ſpeech, after the
ſame manner, as when we ſay of a body, which

though it may have been ſome little time in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
on this account we muſt not uſe the ſimple

               <p>THUS we have given a general idea of the
manner of conception, upon which this doctrine is
built. But as in the former part of this diſcourſe we
confirmed the doctrine of fluxions by demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the moſt circumſtantial kind; ſo here, to
remove all diſtruſt concerning the concluſiveneſs of
this method of reaſoning, we ſhall draw out its
firſt principles into a more diffuſive form.</p>
               <p>FOR this purpoſe, we ſhall in the firſt place
define an ultimate magnitude to be the limit, to
which a varying magnitude can approach within
any degree of nearneſs whatever, though it can
never be made abſolutely equal to it.</p>
               <p>THUS the circle diſcourſed of above, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this definition, is to be called the ultimate
magnitude of the polygon circumſcribing it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this polygon, by increasing the number of its
ſides, can be made to differ from the circle, leſs
than by any ſpace, that can be propoſed how ſmall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0218900500:57"/>
ſoever; and yet the polygon can never become ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
equal to the circle or leſs.</p>
               <p>IN like manner the circle will be the ultimate
magnitude of the polygon inſcribed, with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
only, that as in the firſt caſe the vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
magnitude is always greater, here it will
be leſs than the ultimate magnitude, which is its
limit.</p>
               <p>AGAIN the triangle DEF is the ultimate mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
of the triangle DEG; becauſe the baſe EG,
being always equal to the circumference of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygon,
<figure/>
will conſtantly be greater than the baſe EF,
equal to the circumference of the circle only, and
yet EG may be made to approach EF nearer than
by any difference, that can be named.</p>
               <p>UPON this definition we may ground the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
propoſition; That, when varying magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0218900500:58"/>
keep conſtantly the ſame proportion to each
other, their ultimate magnitudes are in the ſame
proportion.</p>
               <p>LET A and B be two varying magnitudes,
which keep conſtantly in the ſame proportion to
each other; and let C be the ultimate magnitude
of A, and D the ultimate magnitude of B. I ſay
that C is to D in the ſame proportion.</p>
               <p>AS A is a varying magnitude continually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to C, but can never become equal to it,
A may be either always greater or always leſs than
C. <figure/>In the firſt place ſuppoſe it
greater. When A is greater than
C, in approaching to C it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
diminiſhed; therefore B
keeping always in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to A, B in approaching
to its limit D is alſo continually diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>NOW, if poſſible, let the ratio of C to D be
greater than that of A to B, that is, ſuppoſe C to
have to ſome magnitude E, greater than D, the
ſame proportion as A has to B. Since C is the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
magnitude of A in the ſenſe of the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
definition, A can be made to approach nearer
to C than by any difference, that can be propoſed,
but can never become equal to it, or leſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſince C is to E as A to B, B will always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
E; conſequently can never approach to D ſo
near as by the exceſs of E above D: which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.
For ſince D is ſuppoſed the ultimate mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0218900500:59"/>
of B, it can be approached by B nearer than
by any aſſignable difference.</p>
               <p>AFTER the ſame manner, neither can the ratio
of D to C be greater than that of B to A.</p>
               <p>IF the varying magnitude A be leſs than C, it
follows, in like manner, that neither the ratio of C
to D can be leſs than that of A to B, nor the ratio
of D to C leſs than that of B to A.</p>
               <p>IT is an evident corollary from this propoſition,
that the ultimate magnitudes of the ſame or equal
varying magnitudes are equal.</p>
               <p>NOW from this propoſition the fore-mentioned
equality between the circle and triangle DEF will
again readily appear. For the circle being the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
magnitude of the polygon, and the triangle
DEF the ultimate magnitude of the triangle
DEG; ſince the polygon and the triangle DEG
are equal, by this propoſition the circle and triangle
DEF will be alſo equal.</p>
               <p>IF the preceeding propoſition be admitted, as a
genuine deduction from the definition, upon which
it is grounded; this demonſtration of the equality
of the circle and triangle cannot be excepted to.
For no objection can lie againſt the definition itſelf,
as no inference is there deduced, but only the ſenſe
explained of the term defined in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0218900500:60"/>
THE other part of this method, which concerns
varying ratios, may be put into the ſame form by
defining ultimate ratios as follows.</p>
               <p>IF there be two quantities, that are (one or both)
continually varying, either by being continually
augmented, or continually diminiſhed; and if the
proportion, they bear to each other, does by this
means perpetually vary, but in ſuch a manner, that
it conſtantly approaches nearer and nearer to ſome
determined proportion, and can alſo be brought at
laſt in its approach nearer to this determined pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
than to any other, that can be aſſigned,
but can never paſs it: this determined proportion
is then called the ultimate proportion, or the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ratio of thoſe varying quantities.</p>
               <p>TO this definition of the ſenſe, in which the
term ultimate ratio, or ultimate proportion is to
be underſtood, we muſt ſubjoin the following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:
That all the ultimate ratios of the ſame
varying ratio are the ſame with each other.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE the ratio of A to B continually varies
by the variation of one or both of the terms A and
B. If the ratio of C to D be the ultimate ratio of
A to B, and the ratio of E to F be likewiſe the
ultimate ratio of the ſame; I ſay, the ratio of C
to D is the ſame with the ratio of E to F.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0218900500:61"/>
IF poſſible, let the ratio of E to F differ from
that of C to D. Since the ratio of C to D is the
ultimate ratio of A to B, the ratio of A to B, in its
approach to that of C to D, can be brought at laſt
nearer to it, than to any other whatever. Therefore
if the ratio of E to F differ from that of C to D,
the ratio of A to B will either paſs that of E to F,
or can never approach ſo near to it, as to the ratio
of C to D: in ſo much that the ratio of E to F
cannot be the ultimate ratio of A to B, in the ſenſe
of this definition.</p>
               <p>THE two definitions here ſet down, together
with the general propoſitions annexed to them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the whole foundation of this method, we
are now explaining.</p>
               <p>WE find in former writers ſome attempts toward
ſo much of this method, as depends upon the firſt
definition. Lucas Valerius in a moſt excellent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
on the Center of gravity of ſolid bodies, has
given a propoſition nothing different, but in the
form of the expreſſion, from that we have ſubjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to our firſt definition; from which he demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
with brevity and elegance his propoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the menſuration and center of gravity of the
ſphere, ſpheroid, parabolical and hyperbolical co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noids.
This author writ before the doctrine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibles
was propoſed to the world. And ſince,
Andrew Tacquet, in his treatiſe on the Cylindrical
and annular ſolids, has made the ſame propoſition,
though ſomething differently expreſſed, the baſis
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0218900500:62"/>
of his demonſtrations at the ſame time very judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
expoſing the inconcluſiveneſs of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
from indiviſibles. However, the conſideration
of the limits of varying proportions, when the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
expreſſing thoſe proportions have themſelves
no limits, which renders this method of prime and
ultimate ratios much more extenſive, we owe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to Sir Iſaac Newton. That this method, as
thus compleated, is applicable not only to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
treated by the ancients in the method of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtions,
but to many others alſo of the greateſt
importance, appears from our author's immortal
treatiſe on the Mathematical principles of natural
philoſophy.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, we ſhall farther illuſtrate
this doctrine in applying it to the ſame general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
as thoſe, whereby the uſe of fluxions was
above exemplified.</p>
               <p>WE have already given one inſtance of its uſe in
determining the dimenſions of curvilinear ſpaces; we
ſhall now ſet forth the ſame by a more general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>LET ABC be a curve line, its abſciſſe AD, and
an ordinate DB. If the parallelogram EFGH,
formed upon the given line EF under the ſame
angle, as the ordinates of the curve make with its
abſciſſe, be in all parts ſo related to the curve, that
the ultimate ratio of any portion of the abſciſſe
AD to the correſpondent portion of the line EH,
ſhall be that of the given line EF to the ordinate
of the curve at the beginning of that portion of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0218900500:63"/>
abſciſſe then will the curvilinear ſpace ADB be
equal to the parallelogram EG.</p>
               <p>IN the curve let the abſciſſe AD be divided into
any number of equal parts AI, IL, LN, ND,
and let the ordinates IK, LM, NO be drawn,
and alſo in the parallelogram EG the correſpondent
<figure/>
lines PQ, RS and TV. In the curve compleat
the parallelograms IW, LX, NY, and in the
parallelogram EG make the parallelogram PZ e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to the parallelogram IW, the parallelogram
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0218900500:64"/>
RΓ equal to LX, and the parallelogram TΔ e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to NY: then the whole figure IKWMXOYD
will be equal to the whole Figure PZΓΔH.
But in the curve, by increaſing the number and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing
the breadth of theſe parallelograms, the
figure IKWMXOYD will approach nearer and
nearer in magnitude to the curvilinear ſpace ADB;
in ſo much that their difference may be reduced to
leſs than any ſpace, that ſhall be aſſigned; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the curvilinear ſpace ADB is the ultimate
magnitude of the figure IKWMXOYD. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſince the parallelogram EG is in all parts ſo
related to the curve, that the ultimate ratio of every
portion, as LN, of the abſciſſe AD to RT, the
correſpondent portion of EH, is the ſame with
the ratio of EF or RS, to LM; the ultimate
ratio of the parallelogram LX, or its equal RΓ,
to the parallelogram RV, is the ratio of equality.
This is alſo true of all the other correſpondent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelograms;
therefore, the ultimate ratio of the
figure PZΓΔH to the parallelogram PG is the
ratio of equality; that is, the figure PZΓΔH, by
increaſing the number of its parallelograms, can
be brought nearer to the parallelogram PG than
by any difference whatever, that may be propoſed.
Moreover, by increaſing of the number of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
in the curve, the reſiduary portion AI of
the abſciſſe can be reduced to leſs than any magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
that ſhall be propoſed; whereby the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram
EQ, correſponding to this portion of
the abſciſſe, may be alſo reduced to leſs than any
magnitude, that can be propoſed; and the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram
PG be brought to differ leſs from EG than by any aſſignable magnitude. Since therefore the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0218900500:65"/>
figure PZΓΔH can be brought nearer to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelogram
PG than by any difference, that can be
aſſigned; the Figure PZΓΔH can be brought alſo
<figure/>
nearer to the parallelogram EG than by any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that can be aſſigned. Conſequently the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelogram
EG is the ultimate magnitude of the
figure PZΓΔH. Therefore the figures PZΓΔH
and IK WMXOYD being equal varying mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes,
and the ultimate magnitudes of equal
varying magnitudes being equal, the curvilinear
ſpace ADB is equal to the parallelogram EG.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0218900500:66"/>
SUPPOSE the curve ABC were a cubical para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola
convex to the abſciſſe, that is, ſuppoſe Θ
a given line, and Θ<hi>q</hi> × LM = AL <hi>c.</hi> If EH be
= <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> × EF, then the parallelogram EG will
be equal to the ſpace ADB.</p>
               <p>As EH is = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ER will be = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and ET = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, conſequently RT = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Therefore the parallelogram EG is here ſo related
in all parts to the curve, that LN is to RT as Θ<hi>q</hi> × EF
to AL<hi>c</hi> + ¼ AL<hi>q</hi> × LN + AL × LN<hi>q</hi> + ¼ LN<hi>c.</hi>
Now it is evident, that the ratio of LN to RT can
never be ſo great as the ratio of Θ<hi>q</hi> × EF to AL<hi>c</hi>;
but yet, by diminiſhing LN, the ratio of LN to
RT may at laſt be brought nearer to this ratio
than to any other whatever, that ſhould be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Conſequently by the preceeding definition of
what is to be underſtood by an ultimate ratio, the
ratio of Θ<hi>q</hi> × EF to AL<hi>c</hi> is the ultimate ratio of
LN to RT. But AL<hi>c</hi> being = Θ<hi>q</hi> × LM,
Θ<hi>q</hi> × EF is to AL<hi>c</hi> as EF to LM. Therefore
the ratio of EF to LM is the ultimate ratio of
LN to RT. Conſequently, by the preceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
propoſition, the parallelogram EG is equal
to the curvilinear ſpace ADB. And this paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogram
is equal to ¼ AD × DB.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0218900500:67"/>
AGAIN this method is equally uſeful in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the ſituation of the tangents to curve lines.</p>
               <p>IN the curve ABC, whoſe abſciſſe is AD, let
EB be a tangent at the point B. Let BF be the
ordinate at the ſame point B, and GH another or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to it, which ſhall
meet the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in I, and
the line BK,
parallel to
the abſciſſe
AD, in K.
<figure/>Here the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
of HK, the difference of the ordinates, to BK
can never be the ſame with the ratio of BF to FE,
unleſs by the figure of the curve the tangent chance
to cut it in ſome point remote from B; this ratio of
BF to FE being the ſame with that of IK to
KB. But it is farther evident, that the nearer GH
is to FB, the ratio of KH to KB will approach
ſo much the nearer to the ratio of IK to KB;
and the angle, which the curve BC makes with
the tangent BI being leſs than any right-lined an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
it is manifeſt, that GH may be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
towards FB, 'till the ratio of HK to KB,
ſhall at laſt approach nearer to the ratio of IK to
KB, or of BF to FE, than to any other ratio
whatever, that ſhall be propoſed; that is, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
of BF to FE is the ultimate ratio of HK to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0218900500:68"/>
KB. Therefore, if from the properties of the
curve ABC the ratio of HK to KB be determined,
and from thence their ultimate ratio aſſigned; this
ratio thus aſſigned will be the ratio of BF to FE;
becauſe all the ultimate ratios of the ſame variable
ratio are the ſame with each other.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE the curve ABC again to be a cubical
parabola, where BF is = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and GH =
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Here HK will be = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
therefore HK is to FG, or BK, as 3 AF × AG +
FG<hi>q</hi> to Z<hi>q.</hi> Conſequently the ratio of HK to BK
can never be ſo ſmall as the ratio of 3AF<hi>q</hi> to Z<hi>q</hi>;
but by diminiſhing BK it may be brought nearer to
that ratio, than to any other whatever; that is, the
ratio of 3AF<hi>q</hi> to Z<hi>q</hi> is the ultimate ratio of HK
to KB. Therefore, if BF bear to FE the ratio of 3AF<hi>q</hi> to Z<hi>q,</hi> the line BE will touch the curve
in B: and EF will be equal to ⅓ AF.</p>
               <p>AFTER the ſituation of the tangent has been
thus determined, the magnitude of HI, the part
of the ordinate intercepted between the tangent and
the curve, will be known. For example, in this
inſtance ſince BF is to FE, that is IK to FG, as
3AF<hi>q</hi> to Z<hi>q,</hi> IK will be = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and
HK being = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, HI will
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0218900500:69"/>
be = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Now by this line HI may the curvature of curve
lines be compared.</p>
               <p>LET the ſtreight line AB touch the curve CBD
in the point B; CE being the abſciſſe of the curve,
and BF the ordinate at B. Take any other point
G in the curve, and through the points G, B de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
the circle BGH, that ſhall touch the line AB
<figure/>
in B; laſtly, draw IKGL parallel to FB. Here are
two angles formed at the point B with the circle, one
by the line BK, the other by the curve; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the firſt of theſe angles to the ſecond will
be different in different diſtances of the point G from
the point B. And by the approach of G to B the
angle between the circle and curve will be dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
even ſo much as at length to bear a leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the angle between the circle and tangent,
than any, that can be propoſed. That is, by the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0218900500:70"/>
approach of the point G to B the angle between the
tangent and circle may be brought nearer to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
between the tangent and the curve, than by any
difference how minute ſoever homogeneous to thoſe
angles; therefore the magnitude of the circle being
continually varied by the gradual approach of G to
B, and the angle between the tangent and circle
thereby alſo varied; the angle between the tangent
and curve is the ultimate magnitude of theſe angles.
That is, the ultimate of theſe circles determines the
degree of curvature of the curve CBD at the point
B. But in the circle the rectangle under LKG is
equal to the ſquare of BK. And whereas the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
of KL will perpetually vary by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the point G towards B; if BM taken in
FB produced be the ultimate magnitude of KL,
the circle deſcribed through M and B to touch the
tangent AK in B will be the circle, by which the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vature
of the curve CBD in B is to be eſtimated.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE the curve CBD to be the cubical pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabola
as before, where Z<hi>q</hi> × FB is = CF<hi>c,</hi> then
KG will be = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Hence LK
(= <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) is = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But it
is evident, that in a given ſituation of the tangent
AB the ratio of BK<hi>q</hi> to FI<hi>q</hi> is given; therefore
LK will be reciprocally as 3CF + FI, and will
continually increaſe, as the point G approaches to
the point B, but can never be ſo great, as to equal
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; yet by the near approach of G
to B, LK may be brought nearer to this quantity
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0218900500:71"/>
than by any difference, that can be propoſed.
Therefore, by our former definition of ultimate
magnitudes, <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the ultimate mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
of LK. Conſequently, if BM be taken
equal to this <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the circle deſcribed
through M is that required.</p>
               <p>WE have now gone through all, we think need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for illuſtrating the doctrine of prime and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate

in two propoſitions; one in his Introduction to
his treatiſe on the Quadrature of curves; the other
is the firſt propoſition of the book itſelf. In the
firſt he aſſigns the fluxion of a ſimple power, the
latter is univerſal for all quantities whatever.</p>
               <p>FOR determining the fluxion of a ſimple power
ſuppoſe the line
AB to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted

by <hi>x,</hi> and
another line
CD to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
by <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or by conſidering <hi>a</hi> as unite, CD
will be denoted by <hi>xn</hi>.<figure/>

SUPPOSE the points B and D to move in equal
ſpaces of time into two other poſitions E and F;
then DF will be to BE in the ratio of the velocity,
wherewith DF would be deſcribed with an uniform
motion, to the velocity, wherewith BE will be deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in the ſame time with an uniform motion. But
if the point de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the line
AB moves uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly;
the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the line CD is deſcribed, will not be uniform.
<figure/>Therefore the ſpace DF is not deſcribed with a
uniform velocity; in ſo much that the velocity,
wherewith DF would be uniformly deſcribed, is
never the ſame with the velocity at the point D.
But by diminiſhing the magnitude of DF, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
velocity, wherewith DF would be deſcribed,
may be made to approach at pleaſure to the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
at the point D. Therefore the velocity at the
point D is the ultimate magnitude of the velocity,
wherewith DF would be uniformly deſcribed.
Conſequently the ratio of the velocity at D to the
velocity at B is the ultimate ratio of the velocity,
wherewith DF would be uniformly deſcribed, to
the velocity, wherewith BE is uniformly deſcribed.
But DF being to BE as the velocity, wherewith
DF would be uniformly deſcribed, to that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
BE is uniformly deſcribed, the ultimate ratio
of DF to BE is alſo the ultimate ratio of the firſt
of theſe velocities to the laſt; becauſe all the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ratios of the ſame varying ratio are the ſame
with each other. Therefore the ratio of the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0218900500:74"/>
at D to the velocity at B, that is, of the fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of CD to the fluxion of AB, is the ſame with
the ultimate ratio of DF to BE.</p>
               <p>IF now the augment BE be denoted by <hi>o,</hi> the
augment DF will be denoted by
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And here
it is obvious, that all the terms after the firſt taken
together may be made leſs than any aſſignable part
of the firſt. Conſequently the proportion of the
firſt term <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the whole augment may be
made to approach within any degree whatever of
the proportion of equality; and therefore the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
proportion of
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to <hi>o,</hi> or of DF to
BE, is that of <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> only to <hi>o,</hi> or the proportion
of <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to 1.</p>
               <p>AND we have already proved, that the proportion
of the velocity at D to the velocity at B is the ſame
with the ultimate proportion of DF to BE; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the velocity at D is to the velocity at B, or the
fluxion of <hi>xn</hi> to the fluxion of <hi>x,</hi> as <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

               <p>IN the firſt propoſition of the treatiſe of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratures
the author propoſes the relation betwixt
three varying quantities <hi>x, y,</hi> and <hi>z</hi> to be expreſſed
by this equation <gap reason="math">

theſe qnantities to be augmented by any contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraneous

increments great or ſmall. Let us alſo
ſuppoſe ſome quantity <hi>o</hi> to be deſcribed at the

velocity be denoted by <hi>m</hi>; the velocity, wherewith
the augment of <hi>x</hi> would be uniformly deſcribed in
that time be denoted by <hi>ẋ</hi>; the velocity, wherewith
the augment of <hi>y</hi> would be uniformly deſcribed in
the ſame time by <hi>ẏ</hi>; and laſtly the velocity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the augment of <hi>z</hi> would be uniformly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in the ſame time by <hi>ż.</hi> Then <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <gap reason="math">

                  </gap>, and
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> will expreſs the contemporaneous increments
of <hi>x, y,</hi> and <hi>z</hi> reſpectively. Now when <hi>x</hi> is become <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>y</hi> is become <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>z</hi> become <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
the former equation will become
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Here, as the firſt of theſe equations exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
the relation between the three quanties <hi>x, y, z,</hi>
as far as the ſame can be expreſſed by a ſingle equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo this ſecond equation, with the aſſiſtance of
the firſt, will expreſs the relation between the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of theſe quantities. But the firſt of theſe equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be taken out of the latter; whence will
ariſe this third equation <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0218900500:76"/>
                  <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which alſo expreſſes the
relation between the ſeveral increments; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
if <hi>o</hi> be a given quantity, this equation will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
expreſs the relation between the velocities,
wherewith theſe ſeveral increments are generated
reſpectively by a uniform motion. And this equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being divided by <hi>o</hi> will be reduced to more
ſimple terms, and yet will equally expreſs the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theſe velocities; and then the equation will
become <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Now let us form an equation out of the terms of
this, from which the quantity <hi>o</hi> is abſent. This e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation
will be <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and this equation multiplied by <hi>m</hi> becomes
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It is evident, that
this equation does not expreſs the relation of the
forementioned velocities; yet by the diminution of
<hi>o</hi> this equation may come within any degree of
expreſſing that relation. Therefore, by what has
been ſo often inculcated, this equation will expreſs
the ultimate relation of theſe velocities. But the
fluxions of the quantities <hi>x, y, z</hi> are the ultimate
magnitudes of theſe velocities; ſo that the ultimate
relation of theſe velocities is the relation of the
fluxions of theſe quantities. Conſequently this laſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0218900500:77"/>
equation repreſents the relation of the fluxions of
the quantities <hi>x, y, z.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is now preſumed, we have removed all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
from the demonſtrations, which Sir Iſaac
Newton has himſelf given, of his rules for finding
fluxions.</p>
               <p>IN the beginning of this diſcourſe we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
at ſuch a deſcription of fluxions, as might
not fail of giving a diſtinct and clear conception of
them. We then confirmed the fundamental rules
for comparing fluxions together by demonſtrations
of the moſt formal and unexceptionable kind. And
now having juſtified Sir Iſaac Newton's own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations,
we have not only ſhewn, that his
doctrine of fluxions is an unerring guide in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of geometrical problems, but alſo that he
himſelf had fully proved the certainty of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.
For accompliſhing this laſt part of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
it was neceſſary to explain at large ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
method of reaſoning eſtabliſhed by him, no
leſs worthy conſideration; ſince as the firſt inabled
him to inveſtigate the geometrical problems, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he was conducted in thoſe remote ſearches into
nature, which have been the ſubject of univerſal
admiration, ſo to the latter method is owing the
ſurprizing brevity, wherewith he has demonſtrated
thoſe diſcoveries.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>THUS we have at length finiſhed the
whole of our deſign, and ſhall therefore put
a period to this diſcourſe with the explanation of
the term momentum frequently uſed by Sir Iſaac
Newton, though we have yet had no occaſion to
mention it.</p>
               <p>AND in this I ſhall be the more particular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Sir Iſaac Newton's definition of momenta,
That they are the momentaneous increments or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
of varying quantities, may poſſibly be
thought obſcure. Therefore I ſhall give a fuller
delineation of them, and ſuch a one, as ſhall agree
to the general ſenſe of his deſcription, and never
fail to make the uſe of this term, in every propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
where it occurs, clearly to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>IN determining the ultimate ratios between the
contemporaneous differences of quantities, it is often
previouſly required to conſider each of theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
apart, in order to diſcover, how much of
thoſe differences is neceſſary for expreſſing that
ultimate ratio. In this caſe Sir Iſaac Newton di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes,
by the name of momentum, ſo much
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0218900500:79"/>
of any difference, as conſtitutes the term uſed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
this ultimate ratio.</p>
               <p>THUS in page 71, where BE is = <hi>o,</hi> and DF
equal to <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the ultimate ratio of DF to BE be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ratio of

<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to <hi>o,</hi> ſuch a part only
of DF as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
by <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<figure/>without the addition of any of the following terms
of the ſeries, conſtitutes the whole of the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
of the line CD; but the momentum of AB
is the ſame as the whole difference BE, or <hi>o.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN like manner, if A and B denote varying
quantities, and their contemporaneous increments
be repreſented by <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b</hi>; the rectangle under any
given line M and <hi>a</hi> is the contemporaneous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
of the rectangle under M and A, and
A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> + <hi>a</hi> × <hi>b</hi> is the like increment of the
rectangle under A, B. And here the whole incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
M × <hi>a</hi> repreſents the momentum of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctangle
under M, A; but A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> only, and
not the whole increment A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> + <hi>a</hi> × <hi>b,</hi> is
called the momentum of the rectangle under A, B;
becauſe ſo much only of this latter increment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
for determining the ultimate ratio of the
increment of M × A to the increment of A × B, this
ratio being the ſame with the ultimate ratio of
M × <hi>a</hi> to A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi>; for the ultimate ratio of
A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> to A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> + <hi>a</hi> × <hi>b</hi> is the ratio
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0218900500:80"/>
of equality. Conſequently the ultimate ratio of
M × <hi>a</hi> to A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> differs not from the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ratio of M × <hi>a</hi> to A × <hi>b</hi> + B × <hi>a</hi> + <hi>a</hi> × <hi>b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE momenta equally relate to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
of quantities, as to their increments,
and the ultimate ratio of increments, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
at the ſame place is the ſame; therefore
the momentum of any quantity may be determined,
either by conſidering the increment, or the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that quantity, or even by conſidering both
together. And in determining the momentum of
the rectangle under A and B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir Iſaac Newton has
taken the laſt of theſe methods; becauſe by this
means the ſuperfluous rectangle is ſooner diſenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from the demonſtration.</p>
               <p>HERE it muſt always be remembred, that the
only uſe, which ought ever to be made of theſe
momenta, is to compare them one with another,
and for no other purpoſe than to determine the
ultimate or prime proportion between the ſeveral
increments or decrements, from whence they are
deduced <note n="*" place="bottom">Neque ſpect.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">

ratios eſſentially differs from that of indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
for in that method theſe momenta are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
abſolutely as parts, whereof their reſpective

be neceſſary to make them parts capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding

a whole by accumulation; yet their ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ratios are as truly aſſignable as the ratios be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
any quantities whatever. Therefore none
of the objections made againſt the doctrine of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibles
are of the leaſt weight againſt this method:
but while we attend carefully to the obſervation
here laid down, we ſhall be as ſecure againſt error,
and the mind will receive as full ſatisfaction, as in
any the moſt unexceptionable demonſtration of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide.</p>
               <p>WE ſhall make no apology for the length of
this diſcourſe: for as we can ſcarce ſuſpect, after
what has been above written, that our readers will
be at any loſs to remove of themſelves, whatever
little difficulties may have ariſen in this ſubject from
the brevity of Sir Iſaac Newton's expreſſions; ſo
our time cannot be thought miſemployed, if we
ſhall at all have contributed, by a more diffuſive
