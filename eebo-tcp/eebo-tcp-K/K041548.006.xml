            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE following Tragedy may perhaps attract the notice of the curious reader, more by a literary anecdote relating to its ſubject, than by any intrinſic merit as a dramatic compoſition.</p>
                  <p>The ſtory was recommended to <hi>YOUNG</hi> by the Author of Clariſſa.—The poet adopted it, and wrote a ſingle act; but this ſhared the fate of his other unfiniſhed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts, and, according to the direction of his will, was committed to the flames.</p>
                  <p>Theſe particulars, with a conciſe ſketch of the ſtory as related by <hi>RICHARDSON,</hi> were communicated to Mr. <hi>THORNTON</hi> by the poet's very liberal and amiable Son, the neighbour and the much-eſteemed relation of my dear departed friend, who wiſhed me to build a tragedy upon this foundation.</p>
                  <p>Some particular circumſtances prevented me at that time from executing the deſire of a perſon, who, from the integrity of his judgment, and the uncommon warmth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0310600106:5"/>
of his friendſhip, had an undiſputed title to influence my ſtudies.—Other works had engaged me, and this drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſtory lay for ſome years neglected: but in looking over the letters of my ſtill-valued, though loſt correſpondent, it ſtruck me with new force. As the diſtreſs, with which it abounds, is of a private nature, it appeared to me ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly calculated for my purpoſe of forming a drama for a domeſtic theatre. I have therefore, with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable alterations in the principal incident, raiſed from it a tragedy of three acts; with what ſucceſs, it is now the privilege of my readers to pronounce.</p>
                  <p>I will not attempt to influence their deciſion by any arguments in its behalf; but let me be allowed to cloſe this ſhort preface with a little poetical acknowledgment to the two literary illuſtrious friends, who firſt marked the ſtory for the tragic Muſe, and from whom it has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally deſcended to me.</p>

                           <l>You may trace her attachment in every nerve:</l>
                           <l>If I name Mr. Beril in ſome idle tale,</l>
                           <l>Poor Fanny will bluſh, and as often turn pale.</l>
                           <l>In his abſence ſtill more and more penſive ſhe grows,</l>
                           <l>Yet thinks not from whence her uneaſineſs flows.</l>
                           <l>And when he returns, tho' her pleaſure is meek,</l>
                           <l>Yet the glow of content may be ſeen on her cheek</l>
                           <l>And her heart, as if fully conſol'd by his ſight,</l>
                           <l>Appears to repoſe in a tranquil delight.</l>
                           <l>Dear Papa, you'll perceive, if you'll open your eyes,</l>
                           <l>That from none but herſelf ſhe her love can diſguiſe.</l>
                           <l>One other exception perhaps we may find,</l>
                           <l>As I think Mr: Beril is equally blind,</l>
                           <l>And robb'd, like herſelf, of the talent of ſeeing,</l>
                           <l>By that diffident love, which denies its own being.</l>

                           <l>Conſider the delicate frame of my ſiſter!</l>
                           <l>But I know you've a heart that can never reſiſt her,</l>
                           <l>If you once clearly ſee ſhe has fixt her affection,</l>

                           <l>She would die from concealment before ſhe would ſpeak.</l>
                           <l>I have ſtrength to encounter the croſſes of life,</l>
                           <l>And to make my part good, as a daughter or wife:</l>
                           <l>But our gentle ſweet Frances is ill-form'd to bear</l>
                           <l>The undeſerv'd load of vexation and care;</l>

                           <l>Is what, I confeſs, would awaken my fear.</l>
                           <l>As you ſay, your mild ſiſter ſhould never be harraſs'd</l>

I ſhould guard her from all the vexations that wait</l>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>I HAVE endeavoured to delineate, in the following Drama, an exact portrait of the noble Perſonage, whoſe name it bears; as I believe, that a more enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging model of public and private virtue can hardly be ſelected from the annals of any nation: although the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme mildneſs of his temper, the ſimplicity of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and, above all, his unaffected piety, are ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as are very rarely admitted in the formation of a Tragic Hero.</p>
                  <p>To render my performance intereſting to my country, I have adhered as cloſely to our hiſtory, as the nature of dramatic compoſition allowed me to do; and in points where I have varied from hiſtorical truth, ſuch varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are, I truſt, ſupported by dramatic probability.</p>
                  <p>In the ſpirited and judicious introduction to the lately-publiſhed letters of Lady Ruſſel, the teſtimony of different Hiſtorians in collected concerning the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Charles the Second and his brother, on the impending fate of Lord Ruſſel.</p>

                     <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In the Duke of Monmouth's Journal, it is ſaid, that the King told him, he inclined to have ſaved the Lord Ruſſel, but was forced to conſent to his death, otherwiſe he muſt have broke with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Duke of York."</q>
                     <bibl>—Kennet.</bibl>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſentence juſt quoted, is, I hope, a ſufficient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the conduct which I have aſſigned to Charles; whoſe character indeed was ſuch, that fiction can hardly impute to him any inſtance of irreſolution, duplicity, and falſehood, which the tenor of his life will not bring within the limits of theatrical credibility.</p>
                  <p>The candid reader will readily allow the liberty I have taken, in laying the ſcene in the Tower, after Ruſſel's condemnation; as it affords many advantages to the conduct of the play.</p>
                  <p>In compliance with that reſpect, which dramatic authors have lately paid to the Clerical character, I have not introduced either Tillotſon or Burnet among the perſons of the drama, though the latter was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant an attendant on the captivity of my Hero; an omiſſion which I have in ſome degree ſupplied, by the introduction of Mr. Spencer; a character drawn from the printed trial of Lord Ruſſel, where the name of that gentleman appears in the liſt of thoſe,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0310600106:165"/>
who gave an honourable evidence in behalf of the noble priſoner.</p>
                  <p>I have many obligations to the journal written by Burnet, at the requeſt of Lady Ruſſel, which contains all the minute circumſtances that occurred, during the impriſonment, and at the execution of her Lord. This very intereſting and pathetic narrative is printed in the General Dictionary, under the article Ruſſel. I have not only taken from it many of the ſentiments, which I have aſſigned to him in this Tragedy, but I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times adopted the very words, that were really uttered by Lord Ruſſel; and this I have done, not only from an affectionate admiration of his character, but from a deſpair of ſurpaſſing the elegant ſimplicity, and the force of his expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>The offer relating to his eſcape, ſo generouſly made, and ſo nobly refuſed, is a fact univerſally known, and muſt render the names of Cavendiſh and Ruſſel an honour to our country, as long as magnanimity and friendſhip retain their juſt value in the eſtimation of mankind.</p>

I have ſtudied her well, and I clearly deſcry</l>
