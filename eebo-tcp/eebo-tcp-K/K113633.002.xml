            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WHEN I undertook to write a comedy, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I was ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed in favour of the poets
of the laſt age, and ſtrove to imitate them. The
term, genteel comedy, was then unknown amongſt
us, and little more was deſired by an audience, than
nature and humour, in whatever walks of life they
were moſt conſpicuous. The author of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſcenes never imagined that more would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of him, and therefore to delineate character
has been his principal aim. Thoſe who know any
thing of compoſition, are ſenſible, that in purſuing
humour, it will ſometimes lead us into the receſſes
of the mean; I was even tempted to look for it in
the maſter of a ſpunging-houſe: but in deference to
the public taſte, grown of late, perhaps, too deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
the ſcene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the
repreſentation. In deference alſo to the judgment
of a few friends, who think in a particular way, the
ſcene is here reſtored. The author ſubmits it to the
<pb facs="tcp:0422600502:6"/>
reader in his cloſet; and hopes that too much refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will not baniſh humour and character from
ours, as it has already done from the French theatre.
Indeed the French comedy is now become ſo very
elevated and ſentimental, that it has not only ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
humour and Moliere from the ſtage, but it
has baniſhed all ſpectators too.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, the author returns his thanks to
the public for the favourable reception which the
Good-Natur'd Man has met with: and to Mr. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in particular, for his kindneſs to it. It may
not alſo be improper to aſſure any, who ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
write for the theatre, that merit, or ſuppoſed.
merit, will ever be a ſufficient paſſport to his
protection.</p>

                     <p>I can't help being blunt, and being very angry

                     <p>I grant you that he is rather too good-natur'd;
that he's too much every man's man; that he laughs

                     <p>Faith, begging your honour's pardon, I'm ſorry
they taught him any philoſophy at all; it has only
ſerv'd to ſpoil him. This ſame philoſophy is a good

For them all. He calls his extravagance, generoſity;
and his truſting every body, univerſal benevolence.
It was but laſt week he went ſecurity for a fellow
whoſe face he ſcarce knew, and that he called an
act of exalted mu—mu—munificence; ay, that was
the name he gave it.</p>

with very little hopes to reclaim him. That very
fellow has juſt abſconded, and I have, taken up the
ſecurity. Now, my intention is to involve him in
fictitious diſtreſs, before he has plunged himſelf into
real calamity. To arreſt him for that very debt,
to clap an officer upon him, and then let him ſee
which of his friends will come to his relief.</p>

vexed, every groan of his would be muſic to me;

fret him myſelf every morning theſe three years;

hear me ſcold, as he does to his hair-dreſſer.</p>

There is ſomething in my friend Croaker's conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
that quite depreſſes me. His very mirth is
an antidote to all gaiety, and his appearance has a
ſtronger effect on my ſpirits than an undertaker's
ſhop.—Mr. Croaker, this is ſuch a ſatisfaction—</p>

we have in a country going to ruin like ours? taxes

No, my Olivia, neither the force, nor, permit me

                     <p>I'll tell you once for all how it ſtands. A good
part of Miſs Richland's large fortune conſiſts in a
claim upon government, which my good friend,
Mr. Lofty, aſſures me the treaſury will allow. One
half of this ſhe is to forfeit, by her father's will, in
caſe ſhe refuſes to marry you. So, if ſhe rejects
you, we ſeize half her fortune; if ſhe accepts
you, we ſeize the whole, and a fine girl into the
bargain.</p>

Right, gentlemen, very right, upon my word, and

what Mr. Lofty ſent you here to ſee! Theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

                     <p>Ay, it is certainly ſo. Well, though his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities

there's ſomething very ridiculous in them, and a juſt
puniſhment for his diſſimulation.</p>

                     <p>And ſo they are. But I wonder, madam, that the
lawyer you juſt employed to pay his debts, and ſet
him free, has not done it by this time. He ought
at leaſt to have been here before now. But lawyers

                     <p>For Miſs Richland to undertake ſetting him free,
I own, was quite unexpected. It has totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinged
my ſchemes to reclaim him. Yet, it gives
me pleaſure to find, that, among a number of worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
friendſhips, he has made one acquiſition of real
value; for there muſt be ſome ſofter paſſion on her
ſide that prompts this generoſity. Ha! here before

                     <p>It muſt come, ſir, with a very ill grace from you.
To cenſure it, after what you have done, would
look like malice; and, to ſpeak favourably of a
character you have oppreſſed, would be impeaching
your own. And ſure, his tenderneſs, his humanity,
his univerſal friendſhip, may atone for many faults.</p>

                     <p>That friendſhip, madam, which is exerted in too
wide a ſphere, becomes totally uſeleſs. Our boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
like a drop of water, diſappears when diffuſed
too widely. They, who pretend moſt to this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
benevolence, are either deceivers, or dupes.
Men who deſire to cover their private ill-nature, by
a pretended regard for all; or, men who, reaſoning
themſelves into falſe feelings, are more earneſt in
purſuit of ſplendid, than of uſeful virtues.</p>

do? One man can't do every thing; and then, I
do ſo much in this way every day: let me ſee;
ſomething conſiderable might be done for him by
ſubſcription; it could not fail if I carried the

two dozen lords, and half the lower houſe, at my

                     <p>Then, madam, what can we do? You know I
never make promiſes. In truth, I once or twice
tried to do ſomething with him in the way of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but, as I often told his uncle, Sir William

to himſelf, ſhe was ſent to France, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of education; and there every art was tried to
fix her for life in a convent, contrary to her incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
Of this I was informed, upon my arrival
at Paris; and, as I had been once her father's friend,
I did all in my power to fruſtrate her guardian's
baſe intentions. I had even meditated to reſcue her
from his authority, when your ſon ſtept in with more
pleaſing violence, gave her liberty, and you a
daughter.</p>

Yes, Sir, you are ſurpriſed to ſee me;
and I own that a deſire of correcting your follies led
me hither. I ſaw, with indignation, the errors of a
mind that only ſought applauſe from others; that
eaſineſs of diſpoſition, which, though inclined to
the right, had not courage to condemn the wrong.
I ſaw, with regret, thoſe ſplendid errors, that ſtill
took name from ſome neighbouring duty. Your
charity, that was but injuſtice; your benevolence,
that was but weakneſs; and your friendſhip, but
credulity. I ſaw, with regret, great talents, and
extenſive learning, only employed to add ſprightli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to error, and encreaſe your perplexities. I ſaw
your mind with a thouſand natural charms: but,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0422600502:129"/>
the greatneſs of its beauty ſerved only to heighten
my pity for it's proſtitution.</p>

                     <p>Ceaſe to upbraid me, Sir: I have for ſome time
but too ſtrongly felt the juſtice of your reproaches.
But there is one way ſtill left me. Yes, Sir, I have
determined this very hour, to quit for ever a place
where I have made myſelf the voluntary ſlave of all;
and to ſeek among ſtrangers that fortitude which
may give ſtrength to the mind, and marſhal all its
diſſipated virtues. Yet, ere I depart, permit me to
ſolicit favour for this gentleman; who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
what has happened, has laid me under the
moſt ſignal obligations. Mr. Lofty—</p>

                     <p>Mr. Honeywood, I'm reſolved upon a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as well as you. I now begin to find, that the
man who firſt invented the art of ſpeaking truth
was a much cunninger fellow than I thought him.
And, to prove that I deſign to ſpeak truth for the
future, I muſt now aſſure you, that you owe your
late enlargement to another; as, upon my ſoul, I
had no hand in the matter. So now if any of the
company has a mind for preferment, he may take
my place, I'm determined to reſign.</p>

                     <p>I VOW, Mr. Hardcaſtle, you're very particular.
Is there a creature in the whole country, but our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that does not take a trip to town now and
then, to rub off the ruſt a little? There's the two
Miſs Hoggs, and our neighbour, Mrs. Grigſby, go

                     <p>Aye, and bring back vanity and affectation to laſt
them the whole year. I wonder why London can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keep its own fools at home! In my time, the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0422600502:140"/>
follies of the town crept ſlowly among us, but now
they travel faſter than a ſtage-coach. Its fopperies
come down, not only as inſide paſſengers, but in the

                     <p>Aye, your times were fine times, indeed; you
have been telling us of them for many a long year.
Here we live in an old rumbling manſion, that looks
for all the world like an inn, but that we never ſee
company. Our bell viſitors are old Mrs. Oddfiſh,
the curate's wife, and little Cripplegate, the lame
dancing-maſter: and all our entertainment your old

                     <speaker>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
                     <p>No matter, Tony Lumpkin has a good fortune.
My ſon is not to live by his learning. I don't think
a boy wants much learning to ſpend fifteen hundred

                     <speaker>HARDCASTLE.</speaker>
                     <p>I'd ſooner allow him an horſe-pond. If burning
the footmens ſhoes, frighting the maids, and worry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>And am I to blame? The poor boy was always
too ſickly to do any good. A ſchool would be his

<stage>(To him)</stage> We approve your caution and hoſpitality,

me by my uncle, the India director, and chiefly
conſiſts in jewels. I have been for ſome time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading

                        <stage>(Curteſying very low.)</stage> Fine ſpoken, madam, you
are moſt miraculouſly polite and engaging, and
quite the very pink of curteſy and circumſpection,
madam. <stage>(Changing her tone)</stage> And you, you great
ill-faſhioned oaf, with ſcarce ſenſe enough to keep
your mouth ſhut. Were you too join'd againſt me?
But I'll defeat all your plots in a moment. As for
you, madam, ſince you have got a pair of freſh
horſes ready, it would be cruel to diſappoint them.
So, if you pleaſe, inſtead of running away with
your ſpark, prepare, this very moment, to run off
with me. Your old aunt Pedigree will keep you
ſecure, I'll warrant me. You too, Sir, may mount
your horſe, and guard us upon the way. Here,
Thomas, Roger, Diggory, I'll ſhew you, that I
wiſh you better than you do yourſelves.</p>

                  <l>WELL, having ſtoop'd to conquer with ſucceſs,</l>
                  <l>And gain'd a huſband without aid from dreſs,</l>
                  <l>Still as a bar-maid, I could wiſh it too,</l>
                  <l>As I have conquer'd him to conquer you:</l>
                  <l>And let me ſay, for all your reſolution,</l>
                  <l>That pretty bar-maids have done execution.</l>
                  <l>Our life is all a play, compos'd to pleaſe,</l>
                  <l>" We have our exits and our entrances."</l>
                  <l>The firſt act ſhews the ſimple country maid,</l>
                  <l>Harmleſs and young, of every thing afraid;</l>
                  <l>Bluſhes when hir'd, and with unmeaning action,</l>
                  <l>" I hopes as how to give you ſatisfaction."</l>
                  <l>Her ſecond act diſplays a livelier ſcene.—</l>
                  <l>Th' unbluſhing bar-maid of a country inn,</l>
                  <l>Who whiſks about the houſe, at market caters,</l>
                  <l>Talks loud, coquets the gueſts, and ſcolds the waiters.</l>
                  <l>Next the ſcene ſhifts to town, and there ſhe ſoars,</l>
                  <l>The chop-houſe toaſt of ogling <hi>connoiſieurs.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>On 'ſquires and cits ſhe there diſplays her arts,</l>
                  <l>And on the gridiron broils her lover's hearts—</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0422600502:273"/>
And as ſhe ſmiles, her triumphs to compleat,</l>
                  <l>Even common councilmen forget to eat.</l>
                  <l>The fourth act ſhews her wedded to the 'ſquire,</l>
                  <l>And madam now begins to hold it higher;</l>
                  <l>Pretends to taſte, at operas cries caro,</l>
                  <l>And quits her Nancy Dawſon, for Che Faro.</l>
                  <l>Doats upon dancing, and in all her pride,</l>
                  <l>Swims round the room, the Heinell of Cheapſide:</l>
                  <l>Ogles and leers with artificial ſkill,</l>
                  <l>Till having loſt in age the power to kill,</l>
                  <l>She ſits all night at cards, and ogles at ſpadille.</l>
                  <l>Such, through our lives, the eventful hiſtory—</l>
                  <l>The fifth and laſt act ſtill remains for me.</l>
                  <l>The bar-maid now for your protection prays,</l>
                  <l>Turns female Barriſter, and pleads for Bays.</l>

To Sadler's-Wells perhaps, or operas go,</l>
