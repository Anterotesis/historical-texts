            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE advantage of a clear, comprehenſive, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar view of the <hi>FIGURES,</hi> the <hi>TYPES,</hi> and the <hi>PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICTIONS</hi> of ſcripture, is obvious. In the <hi>FIRST,</hi> we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſurpriſing eloquence of Heaven, and diſcern al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every form in nature, a guide to, and an illuſtrator of inſpired truth. By the <hi>SECOND,</hi> we perceive the whole ſubſtance of the goſpel of Chriſt, truly exhibited in ancient ſhadows, perſons, and things;—in laws apparently carnal and trifling. In the <hi>THIRD,</hi> we obſerve how aſtoniſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpired predictions properly arranged, and compared with the hiſtory of nations and churches, do illuſtrate each other; and modern events, as with the evidence of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, confirm our faith in the oracles of God. The uſefulneſs of what I have attempted, with reſpect to all the <hi>THREE,</hi> muſt be leſt to the providence of God.</p>
            <p>The ſubſequent <hi>MEDITATIONS,</hi> relate to the <hi>FIGURES</hi> of ſacred writ. To avoid too peremptory parallels, and to awaken devotion, they are caſt into the preſent form. The <hi>EMBLEMS,</hi> the ſignification of which appeared uncertain or DIVerſified, are repeated under different heads. To ſhun interfering with <hi>TYPES,</hi> many rich <hi>EMBLEMS,</hi> as of <hi>ZION, PRIESTS, &amp;c.</hi> are wholly omitted, or but ſlightly touched. To ſhun a tireſome length, and a ſinking dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that which was juſt before hinted on a ſimilar <hi>EM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLEM,</hi> is not ſeldom paſſed over; and the hiſtory of <hi>EM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLEMS</hi> is leſt to be collected from the account of the <hi>OB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECTS</hi> which they repreſent; nor on <hi>THIS</hi> are ought but hints offered, and the enlargement is left to the reader's own meditation. What friendly indulgence is requiſite to pardon miſtakes, the peruſer muſt judge. Meanwhile, it is hoped he will remember, that the eſpial of faults is much eaſier work than to avoid them.</p>

            <head>BOOK I. <hi>SCRIPTURE-language in general.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the manner of the Eaſt, the language of inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abounds with the moſt ſtriking and inſtructive figures. In noble and candid ſimplicity,—in bold alluſion, not all the writings of men can vie with theſe oracles of God. Here,—as one would expect in the idiom of Godhead, the principal truths are brought down to the weakeſt capacity, that ignorance may have nothing to plead for excuſe; others, chiefly predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are often wrapped up in figures, obſcure, and hard to be underſtood. Thus, till the fulfilment, the learned are forced to acknowledge their ignorance, and malicious oppoſers rendered incapable to ſtop the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted event.</p>
            <p>The figures of ſacred language are either SIMPLE or COMPLEX. The former, without changing the native ſenſe of the words, embelliſh the ſtile, enliven the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, or illuſtrate the ſubject: the latter, while they ennoble the ſtile, and illuſtrate the ſubject, do alſo convert the terms, from their ordinary ſignification, to another connected with it.</p>
            <p>Simple figures are, 1. A REPETITION of the ſame term or phraſe; whether in the ſame, or in different ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0052801100:6"/>
of a chapter, or ſection; as of MY, Pſal. xviii. 1. 2. 3.; <hi>my</hi> God, Pſal. xxii. 1. and cxviii. 28.; <hi>my help,</hi> Pſal. cxxi. 1. 2.;<hi>—whatſoever things are,</hi> Phil iv. 8.; <hi>his mercy endureth for ever,</hi> Pſal. cxxxvi.; <hi>Lord our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. viii. 1. 9. 2. DIVERSIFYING of the ſenſe, while the ſound is nearly retained. Thus, <hi>Walk in the fleſh;</hi> and <hi>war after the fleſh;</hi> agree pretty much in found, but differ vaſtly in ſenſe. 3. CHANGING of the ſenſe of a word in the ſame ſentence. Thus <hi>good,</hi> in Matth. xix. 16. ſignifies, firſt, what is <hi>good</hi> and uſeful, in a limited ſenſe; and then, what is infinitely and originally <hi>good: fruit of the vine,</hi> Matth. xxvi. 29. both ſignifies natural wine, and eternal happineſs. 4. CONFORMATION of the ſound of the terms, to the mournful, the joyful, the terrible, deterſtable, or ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nature of the ſubject. Thus the portion of the wicked is deſcribed in words ſounding forth terror, Pſal. xi. 5. 6.; the laſt day, in moſt dreadful language, 2 Pet. iii. 10. 12. 5. OUTCRIES of admiration, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, deriſion, commendation, wiſhing, pity, joy, grief; as, <hi>How great is his goodneſs!</hi> Zech. ix. 17. <hi>O wretched man that I am!</hi> &amp;c. Rom. vii. 24, <hi>O woman great is thy ſaith!</hi> Matth. xv. 28. 6. CORRECTIONS of what was juſt before aſſerted; as, <hi>Yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> Gal. ii. 20. <hi>Yet not I, but the grace of God,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 10. 7. In promiſes, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and eſpecially that which is terrible in a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, complaint, or oath, is ſometimes partly SUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRESSED: as, <hi>He ſhall be chief ana captain,</hi> 2 Sam. v. 8. <hi>I will drive him out,</hi> Gen. iii. 22. <hi>Wilt thou caſt me off?</hi> Pſal. vi. 3. <hi>Let me ceaſe to exiſt,</hi> if I lie, Pſal. lxxxix. 35. 8. Interrupting ADDRESSES: as, of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah to God, chap. iv. 4. 5.; of God, by Joel, to the Hebrews, chap. ii. 12. 13.; of David to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Gilboa; to the daughters of Iſrael; to Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, 2 Sam. i. 21. 24. 25. 26. 9. INTRODUCTION of ſpeeches, real or feigned: as, of the choſen ruler of Judah, Iſ. iii. 7.; of their women, Iſ. iv. 1.; of the fir-trees, and of the dead, Iſ. xiv. 8. 9.; of hell and deſtruction, Job xxviii. 22. When theſe ſpeeches are wicked, they are ſometimes expreſſed, not as uttered by the author, but as they truly meant. Thus, ſinful
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0052801100:7"/>
means of relief are called <hi>a covenant with hell, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with death,</hi> Iſ. xxviii. 15.: flattering prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are called <hi>deceits,</hi> Iſ. xxx. 10.: falſe witneſſes are called <hi>ſons of Belial,</hi> 1 Kings xxi. 10. 10. QUESTIONS, expreſſive of abſurdity, wonder, doubt, demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, expoſtulation, anger, inſult, grief, negation, pity, deſire, refuſal, prohibition: as, <hi>How can a man be born when he is old?</hi> John iii. 4. <hi>How excellent is thy loving kindneſs!</hi> Pſal. xxxvi. 7. <hi>Shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?</hi> Gen. xvii. 17. <hi>Is anything too hard for the Lord?</hi> Gen. xviii. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 11. APPEALS to thoſe who are argued againſt: as, of the apoſtles to the Jewiſh rulers, Acts iv. 19.; of Paul to the Galatians, chap. iii. 2. 12. RETORTION, or throwing back an accuſation or objection, on the ſtarter of it. So God throws back the charge of <hi>injuſtice</hi> on the Jews, who charged him with it, Ezek. xviii.: the Syrophenician woman pleads the character of a <hi>dog,</hi> thrown out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her,—as an argument for mercy, Matth. xv. 26. 27. To repel the queſtion, By what authority he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Jeſus poſed the inquirers, <hi>Whether the baptiſm of John was from heaven, or of men?</hi> Matth. xxi. 23.—25. 13. PREVENTION of objections, by anſwering them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be ſtarted: Thus the objection, of God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting his church, is prevented, Iſ. xlix. 14. 15. 14. An apparent YIELDING of that which an oppoſer pleads, in order to ſhew its abſurdity; or its inſufficiency to eſtabliſh the point in diſpute. So Paul grants the Jews to have great knowledge of the law, and a capacity to inſtruct others;—in order to ſhew them, how their ſin in breaking the law was aggravated, Rom. ii. 17.—24. James grants the ungodly profeſſor, that he <hi>had faith;</hi> but ſhews that the devils alſo <hi>believed and trembled,</hi> Jam. ii. 19. 15. ASSIGNATION of the reaſon of an action, or name. Thus, Paul was not aſhamed of the goſpel, becauſe it was <hi>the power of God for ſalvation to believers;</hi> and it was ſo, becauſe <hi>therein the righteouſneſs of God was revealed,</hi> Rom. i. 16. 17. The law ſilenceth and condemns all men, becauſe <hi>by it is the knowledge of ſin;</hi> and therefore, <hi>by the deeds of it ſhall no fleſh be juſtified;</hi> Rom. iii. 19. 20. No man can be ſaved by the law; <hi>becauſe it worketh wrath</hi> in our corrupt nature againſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0052801100:8"/>
God, and condemns us to his juſt wrath, Rom. iv. 14. 15. 16. Lively DESCRIPTIONS; which, as it were, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the objects to our eyes, and other ſenſes: as, of Tophet, Iſ. xxx. 33.; of Goliah, 1 Sam. xvii. 4.—6.; of God's compaſſion, Jer. xxxi. 20. Hoſ. xi. 7. 8. 17. DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GRESSIONS; in which the ſpeaker, for a time, turns aſide from his immediate ſubjects, and deſcants upon an object occaſionally mentioned. Thus the apoſtles often turn aſide to diſcourſe concerning Jeſus Chriſt: as Rev. i. 5.—8. Col. i. 14.—22. 18. TRANSITIONS; in which one part of the ſentence reſpects that which went before, and another what follows. Thus, <hi>Covet ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly the beſt gifts,</hi> reſpects what precedes; and, <hi>I ſhew you a more excellent way,</hi> that which follows, 1 Cor. xii. 31. 19. CONTRASTS; in which ſubjects diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar are compared, in order to mark clearly the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, value, or unworthineſs of the one: ſo the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wicked is contraſted with that of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, Pſal. i. God's kindneſs, and mens unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wickedneſs, are contraſted, Iſ. v. 1.—4. Men and the Holy Ghoſt are contraſted, Acts v. 4. 20. COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PARISON of things, like or unlike, in order to argue from the one to the other. Thus Chriſt argues from the leſſer to the greater, Matth. vi. 30. and vii. 11.; and that God is to feared rather than men, Matth. x. 28. 21. INDUCTION; by which compound things are repreſented in their various parts. And here there is, generally, an aſcending, as to the object, or the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Thus the deſolation of a country is deſcribed from the caſe of the fields, the inhabitants, people, prieſt, ſervant, maſter, ſeller, buyer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Iſ. xxiv. 1. 2. 3. God's juſt judgment is repreſented in his reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the righteous, and puniſhing the wicked, Rom. ii. 6.—9. The reſurrection is deſcribed, as partly to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and partly to damnation, John v. 28. 29. Chriſt's ſtate is deſcribed, from the debaſed and exalted circumſtances of it, Phil. i. 6.—10. Thus the ſin or the judgment of men is often deſcribed, in a variety of particulars, Ezek. xxii. and xxiii. 22. CROWDING of various qualities or things into one ſentence: as, of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, rams, bullocks, lambs, he-goats, vain oblations, new moons, ſabbaths, aſſemblies, Iſ. i. 11. 13. 14.; of

CIRCUMLOCUTIONS; in which, for modeſty, or to ſweeten or heighten the language, the proper name of an object is avoided, and an indirect deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is given in its ſtead.

The name of the matter, the author, the cauſe, or inſtrument, is given to that which is produced from, or by it; or the name of the effect is given to the author, cauſe, or inſtrument. Thus the wood in the houſes and furniture of Jeruſalem is called a <hi>foreſt,</hi> Jer. xxi. 14.

iii. 1. Contrariwiſe, Chriſt is called <hi>ſalvation,</hi> becauſe he is the author of it, Gen. xlix. 18.; Eſau's, taking Canaanitiſh wives is called a <hi>grief, i. e.</hi> a cauſe of grief, Gen. xxvi. 35.; the goſpel is called <hi>the power of God, i. e.</hi> the inſtrument of exerting it, Rom. i. 16.; victory over the world is called <hi>faith,</hi> as faith obtains it, 1 John v. 4.; the tranſgreſſion of Iſrael is called <hi>Samaria;</hi> and the high-places of Judah, <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> becauſe theſe cities chiefly promoted wickedneſs and idolatry, Mic. i. 5; wiſdom and knowledge are called <hi>ſtability,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the means of it, Iſ. xxxiii. 6. 2. The name of a ſubject is given to its adjunct; and of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct to its ſubject. Thus a city, a country, the earth, the world, is put for the inhabitants of it, Jer. iv. 29. Gen. vi. 11.; a cup, for that which is contained in it, 1 Cor. xi. 25. <hi>This cup,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. xxxiii. 4.; a neſt for the pullets in it, Deut xxii. 11.; the heart, for the deſires, or other things, contained in it, Pſal. lxii. 8.; <hi>Pour out your hearts.</hi> The name of a poſſeſſor, is given to what is poſſeſſed; ſo Chriſt's people are called himſelf, Matth. xxv. 35.—45. Acts ix. 4. 1 Cor. xii. 12.; ſo <hi>the Lord, i. e.</hi> what offerings belonged to him, is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Levi's inheritance, Deut. x. 9. The name of the thing ſignified is given to the ſign; ſo the wine in the Lord's ſupper is called <hi>Chriſt's blood,</hi> or the <hi>New Teſtament in it,</hi> Matth. xxvi. 26.; and of the ſign to the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; the ſovereign rule is called a <hi>ſceptre,</hi> Gen. xlix. 10. The name of the quality is given to its ſubject; ſo a ſcarlet and crimſon coloured thing is called <hi>ſcarlet</hi> and <hi>crimſon,</hi> Iſ. i. 18. The name of that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, is given to that which contains it; ſo fields are called <hi>the upper and nether ſprings,</hi> Joſh. xv. 19. 3. Names are put for the perſon or thing named; ſo the <hi>name</hi> of Chriſt, or of God, often ſignifies preciſely <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>God</hi> himſelf, Acts iv. 12. Deut xxviii. 58. 4.

            <p>By SYNCEDOCHE, 1. More univerſal terms are put for ſuch as are more reſtricted: as ALL, for <hi>many;</hi> for all kinds; for the greater or better part, Matth. iii. 5.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0052801100:11"/>
and xix. 28.; <hi>the world,</hi> for the Roman empire, the Gentiles, the wicked, the Antichriſtians, Luke ii. 1. 1 John ii. 2. and v. 18. Rev. xiii. 8.; <hi>every creature,</hi> for men, Mark xvi. 15.; or the plural number for the ſingular, as <hi>children,</hi> for child, Gen. xxi. 7. 2. More reſtricted terms are put for ſuch as are more extenſive: as, <hi>one</hi> for all of the kind, Pſal. i. 1.; <hi>yeſterday,</hi> for time paſt, Heb. xiii. 8,; a limited number, as <hi>thrice, ſeven,</hi> or ten <hi>times,</hi> for frequently, 2 Cor. xii. 8. Pſal. cxix. 164.; a <hi>thouſand, five thouſand,</hi> for an uncertain number, Iſ. xxx. 17. 3. A whole perſon, thing, place, or time, is put for an adjunct or part of it. So Chriſt is ſaid to die; to be buried; when only his body died, and was buried, John xix. 42. and ii. 13.; <hi>world</hi> is put for <hi>Canaan,</hi> Rom. iv. 13.; <hi>north</hi> for <hi>Caldea,</hi> Jer. i. 13. <hi>for ever,</hi> for a <hi>long</hi> time, Dan. ii. 4. 4. A part of a perſon, thing, place, or time, is put for the whole of it. So <hi>ſouls</hi> denote human perſons, Acts ii. 41; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> is put for Chriſt's whole appearance in our nature, Acts i. 22.; <hi>hour</hi> for a period of time, John iv. 23.</p>
            <p>By MEIOSIS, a great deal leſs is expreſſed, than is really ſignified. Thus, in the negative precepts, much more is intended than is literally expreſſed, Exod. xx. 3.—17.</p>
            <p>By HYPERBOLE, things are repreſented, as far more inſignificant, great, glorious, or numerous, than they really are. So the Hebrew ſpies are repreſented as <hi>graſshoppers,</hi> Numb. xiii. 33.; the top of a tower or wall is ſaid <hi>to reach to heaven,</hi> Gen. xi. 4. Deut. xi. 1.; the hiſtories of all Chriſt's works could not be <hi>contained,</hi> rather <hi>peruſed,</hi> by the <hi>world,</hi> John xxi. 25.; the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites are repreſented, as in number <hi>like to the ſand on the ſea ſhore, or duſt of the earth,</hi> Gen. xiii 16. and xxii. 17.; ſo contentions are called <hi>wars,</hi> Jam. iv. 1.; plenty of milk, honey, and butter, or oil, is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as <hi>rivers of it,</hi> Job. xxix. 6.; Saul and Jonathan are repreſented as <hi>ſwifter than eagles,</hi> and <hi>ſtronger than lions,</hi> 2 Sam. i. 23. The terms of this figure muſt al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ways be underſtood with due limitation.</p>
            <p>By IRONY, words are uttered with ſuch an air, or other circumſtance, as makes them bear a ſignification
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0052801100:12"/>
quite contrary to their common one: as, <hi>Let them,</hi> the falſe gods, <hi>riſe up and help you,</hi> Deut. xxxii. 38. <hi>Bleſs God, and die,</hi> Job. ii. 12. <hi>Rejoice, O young man,</hi> &amp;c. Eccl. xi. 9. <hi>Sleep on now,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. xxvi. 45. <hi>Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud; for he is a God,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Kings xviii. 27. <hi>Go up and proſper; for the Lord ſhall deliver it,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Kings xxii. 15. When the irony is extremely ſharp and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it is called a <hi>ſarcaſm,</hi> as <hi>a goodly price,</hi> &amp;c. Zech. xi. 13. <hi>How glorious was the King of Iſrael to day!</hi> 2 Sam. vi. 20. <hi>He truſted in God,</hi> Pſal. xxii. 8.</p>
            <p>By METAPHOR, the names, qualities, and actions, proper to ſome perſons or things, are aſcribed to other perſons or things, becauſe of ſome <hi>likeneſs</hi> between them. Theſe of rational beings, are aſcribed to other rational beings; ſo Satan is called a <hi>god;</hi> miniſters <hi>angels,</hi> &amp;c. Thoſe of inanimate things, to other inanimate things; ſo, God's purpoſe, or goſpel, is called a <hi>foundation,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe of living creatures, to things without life: ſo the creation is ſaid to <hi>groan,</hi> to <hi>travail,</hi> to <hi>will,</hi> &amp;c. Thoſe of things without life, to ſuch as have it; ſo Chriſt is called a <hi>way,</hi> a <hi>door,</hi> the <hi>truth,</hi> &amp;c.—That, by comparing the volumes of nature with the oracles of God, we may be alway, and every-where, ſurrounded with ſpiritual monitors.

            <p>To underſtand Metaphors, it muſt be obſerved, that the foundation thereof is LIKENESS between the things from which the metaphor is drawn, and that to which it is applied. When this likeneſs is exhibited in one or a few expreſſions, it is a SIMPLE METAPHOR, When it is purſued with a variety of expreſſions, or there is a continued aſſemblage of metaphors, it is called an AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEGORY. When the reſemblance is harſh and far fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to <hi>ſet a voice,</hi> it is a CATACHRESIS. When it is couched in a ſhort ſaying, obſcure and ambiguous, it is called a RIDDLE. When it is couched in a ſhort ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonly uſed, it is termed a PROVERB. When the metaphoric repreſentation is delivered in form of a hiſtory, it is a PARABLE. 2. Becauſe every thing has various qualities and operations, one thing may be the metaphorical emblem of perſons or things different, or contrary: ſo a LION is the emblem of God, of Chriſt, of Satan, and of men, good and bad. 3. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the emblem, and the object of the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor; that is, between that from which the metaphor is drawn, and that which it exhibits, renders it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any metaphor fully to repreſent its object, and abſurd to expect, that an univerſal ſimilitude betwixt the emblem and the object ſhould ever be found. 4. Hence it ſollows, that to ſqueeze metaphors, by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the parallel further than truth and decency, with reſpect to the emblem and object, will admit, is not to illuſtrate, but to diſcredit and darken the myſteries of God. 5. Nay, in the ſacred metaphors, one particular is generally the <hi>principal</hi> thing thereby exhibited. THIS, by the attentive reader or preacher, ſhould, from the circumſtances of the text or context, be eſpecially enquired after, and conſidered</p>

Our adored Mediator is his Secretary, his Miniſter of ſtate. The ſcriptures of truth are the ſtatutes of his kingdom, and the authentic records of his reign. The ſentences of free forgiveneſs, of undeſerved happineſs, or of everlaſting damnation, are the momentous edicts which proceed from his throne.—"Thou art my King, O God, command deliverance for Jacob."</p>

6. God is compared to a JUDGE. With infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and prudence; with unblemiſhed equity, <hi>terrible majeſty,</hi> unbounded authority, power, and courage, he maintains the honour of his ſacred laws. Effectually he fiſts every man and devil at his bar: ſolemnly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly he chargeth them with their proper deeds: authoritatively he pronounceth, and infallibly he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth upon them, the moſt righteous ſentences, correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to the precept and the ſanction of his law. It is at the higheſt peril, if I, if any creature, deſpiſe him; pretend to appeal from him; or find fault with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions.—Lord, "enter not into into judgment with thy ſervant," upon his own works; "for in thy ſight no living can be juſtified."</p>
               <p n="7">7. God is a ſwift WITNESS. How exact is his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things! he is infinitely true and faithful. Solemnly, by ſubſcription and oath, he atteſts the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired declarations of truth; the glad tidings of great joy; the record concerning his Son,—That in him there is eternal life for ſinners of mankind, even the chief. In oppoſition to my wretched unbelief, he teſtifies to my heart, <hi>I am God, even thy God.</hi> At the tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous peril of calling, of attempting to make the <hi>God of truth a liar,</hi> a perjured perſon, do I, and do you chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, heſitate a moment to believe the <hi>joyful ſound?</hi> Your whole conduct he knows; and according to his remembrance of it ſhall you be quickly judged, and your eternal ſtate fixed. Even now, ye wicked, he teſtifies of your guilt by his judgments upon you; by his word unto you: but ſuddenly he ſhall declare it to your face; publiſh it to the world; and haſten your end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ruin. If God be my witneſs, what manner of perſon ought I to be "in all holy converſation and godlineſs?"</p>
               <p n="8">8. God is compared to a CAPTAIN, and called the LORD OF HOSTS. It is his to levy, to march, to muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and manage every army upon earth.

               <p n="9">9. God is ſtiled a MAN OF WAR, or expert warrior. With unbounded wiſdom, equity, power, and courage, he manageth every temporal, every ſpiritual warfare on earth. His choſen people he conquers by the ſword of his Spirit, and the power of his grace. His, and their enemies, he ſeaſonably, ſecretly, ſuddenly, boldly, and furiouſly attacks, routs, and deſtroys. Thus he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his honour; extends his peculiar dominion; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects his friends; and enricheth them with his ſpoil.—Againſt my corruptions, Lord, draw out the <hi>ſpear and ſhield;</hi> ſtain all thy raiment with their blood.</p>

No creature is able, nor without infinite peril dares to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him. With eaſe he diſmays, diſcomfits, and rains his enemies. Fearfully he often corrects his friends, and makes them to tremble under his hand. "Stand in awe," my ſoul, "and ſin not Fear him that is able to caſt ſoul and body into hell-fire; yea, I ſay, Fear him?" And be thou ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</p>

He <hi>dwells with,</hi> and in <hi>them, according to</hi> his infinite <hi>knowledge</hi> and love, Other members of the viſible church are united to him by external relation, and ſhare of his common favours: but thoſe he peculiarly provides for, counſels, comforts, protects, and cheriſhes: nor doth he ever leave them, or forſake them.—Is my Maker my huſband! is the Lord of hoſts his name? the God of the whole earth MAY he be called.</p>

univerſal frame of nature, the whole vineyard of his church, and outfield wilderneſs of this world, is of his plantation; and is under his care and management.

In the rich paſtures of proſperity are many ſinners, through their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, fed for the ſlaughter of endleſs ruin. His own Son he planted in the barren ſoil of our nature; raiſed him up a <hi>plant of renown,</hi> the <hi>growth,</hi> the <hi>branch</hi> of the Lord: in death he cut him down, and trode him to duſt, in the wine-fat of his indignation: he raiſed him again, and <hi>gave him glory; that our faith and hope might be in God.</hi> At infinite expence of power, love, care, meritorious ſuffering, and DIVine interceſſion, he plants, he manageth, the vineyard of his church. The <hi>ſtones</hi> of Heatheniſm, Popery, and like abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he gradually digs out. The <hi>wine-preſs</hi> of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, he graciouſly erects.

He ſows her with the <hi>good ſeed</hi> of his word, and plants her with his precious ſaints. Every one of theſe he forms into a fruitful field, and delightful <hi>vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi> for himſelf. By breaking, by melting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving their hardneſs and obduracy, he digs out the <hi>ſtones</hi> of their heart: by convincing, enlightening and renewing influence, he ploughs up its <hi>fallow ground</hi> and ſows therein the <hi>good ſeed</hi> of his grace. It is thine O JEHOVAH, to weed, to prune thy vineyard, by ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified affliction, and ſin-killing influence: to water it with the heavenly dew, the bleſſed rain of thy word and Spirit: thine to purge the world, by rooting out, by lopping off the noxious, the luxuriant tranſgreſſors; and to water it with the drops of proſperity. Angels, miniſters, and magiſtrates, are employed to labour in, cultivate, and protect thy huſbandry. Thine all-ſeeing eyes are ever on it, to ſhew thyſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them that fear thee. But ſuch as bring not forth good fruit, wilt thou give up to the ſtroke of thy wrath, and at laſt to the vengeance of hell fire.—May I, Lord, be thy <hi>huſbandry:</hi> plant me in Chriſt; <hi>ſow</hi>

His having <hi>power over fire,</hi> imports his abſolute dominion over all the judgments of God, and the angry contentions of men; and his coming in flaming fire, to take vengeance on them who know not God, and who obey not the goſpel.

With the motives, of our abſolute neceſſity; of his own excellency; his high dignity; his unfading comelineſs; his unſearchable riches; his dying, his giving, his almighty love,—he enforceth his ſuit. The love tokens of ordinances, of common ſpiritual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, being given, he, in the moment fixed by his ancient purpoſe, breaks our union to the broken covenant, to our luſts, to Satan, and to a preſent evil world.

Think, my ſoul, how it grieves him, when his propoſals are ſlighted! how he leaves the deſpiſers to wonder and periſh, under the fury of his Father's juſt vengeance! to whom, at the end, he will deliver up the kingdom, and render an exact account of his management and ſucceſs.—If this <hi>Ambaſſador of peace weep bitterly;</hi> if by tears, by groans, by blood, by death, he beſeech me to be reconciled unto God; O my foul, beware of him; obey his voice; provoke him not; he will not pardon my wilful, my final, tranſgreſſions; for my Father's name is in him.</p>

By paſſing and executing proper and ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſentences, he renders himſelf infinitely terrible to offenders. It is his to recognize every man's deeds, and

to reward or revenge, as they are good, or bad. Now, every conſcience, every church ruler, is deputy under him. At the laſt day, every man, every apoſtate angel; ſhall be publicly fiſted at his deciſive tribunal.

Kindly, freely, readily, and often undeſired, he undertakes them, as far as equity permits. With in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinite ſkill, integrity, faithfulneſs, boldneſs, care, and ſucceſs, he pleads them at his Father's bar, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that a broken law, a malicious devil, or guilty conſcience, can alledge to oppoſe him.

In his ancient purpoſe, in his incarnation and death, God planted him: in his reſurrection and aſcenſion, he raiſed him up, and gave him glory: In the preaching of the goſpel, in the eſteem and affection of his people, he continueth to exalt him: at the laſt day he will raiſe him up to judge the world, and thereby diſplay his aſtoniſhing height and grandeur.

               <p n="90">90. Chriſt is called the ROSE OF SHARON, or field <note n="b" place="bottom">Song ii. 1.</note>. In his birth, he grew out of David's withered root; he grew up in the field of this world, and was therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to contempt, trouble, and death.

On that, upon which the firſt-fruits of wheat were offered, he returned to bleſs the nations in the power of his Spirit.</p>

To make way for his ſpiritual kingdom, he overthrew the Heatheniſh empire of Rome, and ſubdued the nations to himſelf.

Their <hi>ſtreight feet, and ſoles like thoſe of a calf,</hi> denotes their upright goſpel-converſation, and fitneſs to tread out the corn of God's word, for their hearers. Their having <hi>hands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their wings,</hi> imports the correſpondence of their practice, with their ſolemn profeſſions and engagements. Their <hi>wings being ſtretched upward,</hi> implies their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on Chriſt for furniture and direction. Their <hi>covering of their bodies and feet with their wings,</hi> imports their bluſhing at themſelves and their work before God. Their appearance like <hi>lamps</hi> and <hi>coals of fire,</hi> marks their zeal for the glory of God, and their communicating light and knowledge to men. Their running <hi>ſtraight forward as a flash of lightning,</hi> imports their integrity, quick progreſs, and majeſty in their work. Their <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with the wheels,</hi> implies their conſtant connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with, and attendance on the rolling churches; the ſame ſpirit is in both; and as they are dull, or active, ſo ordinarily are the churches. Their <hi>voice like many waters extending to the outer court,</hi> imports the powerful and extenſive ſpread of the goſpel, chiefly among the Gentiles. Their warning people <hi>to come and ſee,</hi> when the ſeals are opened, implies, that the goſpel preached; tends to cauſe men conſider the word and providence of God. <hi>The man in the firmament above them, incircled with fire and a rainbow,</hi> is Chriſt, as the glorious and majeſtic head of the church, and of the new covenant, inſpecting, helping, upholding, and governing them. <hi>The voice from the firmament when they ſtand or let down their wings,</hi> is Chriſt's quickening and encouraging them to their work. <hi>The taking out fire from between them, to caſt upon ſinners,</hi> implies that contempt of Chriſt, and his goſpel-miniſtry, eſpecially haſtens, and enhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth flaming vengeance upon a land. One of theſe beaſts giving the <hi>ſeven vials</hi> to be poured on Antichriſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that according to their word, and by their means, ſhall that <hi>man of ſin</hi> be haſtened to his ruin.</p>

Their being the <hi>ſons of Zadok, not of the Levites that went aſtray,</hi> implies their being true and blameleſs children of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the righteous;</hi> and faithful preachers of his atonement, as the great ſubſtance of the goſpel; and that ſuch as have fallen into ſcandal, are not raſhly to be admitted to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. Their <hi>eight day's conſecration,</hi> implies their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance on their work with much deliberation, abundant application of Jeſus' blood, and vigorous ſtudy of goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-holineſs; their having <hi>diſtinct chambers for themſelves,</hi> imports that their office is ſtrictly circumſcribed by the DIVine law; and that none are to interfere with their work or benefice, but ſuch as are truly ſent. Their <hi>higheſt chambers being moſt ſtraitened,</hi> imports, that the moſt eminent miniſters in the church, are ordinarily moſt hated and expoſed to trouble on earth. Their being "clothed with linen, not with wool, or any thing that cauſeth ſweat," imports their being clothed with Jeſus' righteouſneſs, and not with their own fatiguing and and defiling works; and that their doctrine muſt be pure, not erroneous and unſavoury; that their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation muſt be holy, not offenſive, ſtupid, or ſlothful; nor their miniſtry their burden. Their <hi>linen bonnets and breeches,</hi> denote their gravity, their modeſty, their chaſtity, and freedom from Antichriſtian whoredom. Their <hi>laying aſide their fine robes;</hi> and <hi>wearing others before the people,</hi> imply that though they muſt only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God in the righteouſneſs of his Son; yet, by their holy converſation, they muſt recommend holineſs to their hearers and neighbours.

Their "not ſhaving their heads, or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their locks to grow," imports their abſtaining from Popiſh ſuperſtition, and from worldly pride and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs. They muſt beware of being intoxicated with drunkenneſs and carnal care. They muſt marry

ſuch women only, as are of good report. They muſt teach the people of God, and compoſe differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. They muſt avoid immoderate ſorrow for deceaſed friends. And plentifully they muſt nouriſh their ſouls on Chriſt and him crucified. And plentifully are they and their families to be maintained by their people. Their <hi>boiling of the ſin-offering and treſpaſs-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> denotes their digeſting goſpel-truth in their heart and judgment; and their preparing of their diſcourſes before they preach them.</p>

Never muſt they entangle themſelves with worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, carnal offices, or temptations; but vigorouſly make war on the kingdom of Satan; pull down his <hi>ſtrong holds</hi> of ſinful luſts, abominable errors and hateful practices; and endeavour to conquer ſinful men to Jeſus Chriſt, the

It is theirs to notice the variation of the times and providences of God; to obſerve the motions and approaches of every ſpiritual enemy, that, during the night of diſtreſs, and of time, they may give us diſtinct, early, and full warning of our duty and danger.

How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to obſervation, and to tempeſts of trouble! How ſupernatural and ſpeedy their motions! How heavy the judgment, when they are removed from a land, or their uſefulneſs DIVinely reſtrained!</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. FALSE teachers are repreſented as MESSENGERS and SPIRITS OF DEVILS <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Cor. xi. 15. Rev. xvi. 14.</note>. By Satan they are ſent, excited, directed, and actuated. His honour and intereſt they promote and maintain. And in filthineſs, in pride, in malice, in ſlander of the ſaints, in active waſting of the church, and in ruining mens ſouls, they imitate his example.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They, chiefly ſome principal ones, are called AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICHRISTS <note n="b" place="bottom">1 John. ii. 18.</note>. They oppoſe Chriſt in his perſon, his office, his righteouſneſs, his interceſſion, his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his laws, his conqueſts, his government, and the end of his work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are repreſented as FALSE PROPHETS and APOSTLES, and ſome of them as falſe Chriſts <note n="c" place="bottom">2 Pet. ii. 1. Matth. xxiv. 24.</note>. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a commiſſion from God, and often a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed one; ſometimes to be the Meſſiah, they, in his name, publiſh their falſe doctrines; attempt to erect falſe churches; claim uncommon power; pretend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed gifts and grace; propheſy of future events; promiſe to themſelves and their followers liberty and peace, when ſwift deſtruction cometh upon them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are repreſented as MURDERERS <note n="d" place="bottom">Zech. xi. 5.</note>. By ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting to warn the wicked of their evil ways, and to promote their repentance, by falſe doctrines; by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed example; and by unfaithful diſpenſing of DIVine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, they deſtroy the cauſe and intereſt of truth; crucify Jeſus afreſh; and ruin the ſouls of men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They are repreſented as PIMPS, and WHORISH WOMEN <note n="e" place="bottom">Rev. ii. 20.</note>. With the utmoſt impudence, craft, and carnal enticement, they decoy multitudes to go a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from God and his ways, and to defile themſelves, "fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh and of the mind."</p>
               <p n="6">6. They are repreſented as angry MOTHER'S CHIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DREN,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0052801100:228"/>
and OUTRAGIOUS WATCHMEN <note n="a" place="bottom">Song i. 6. and v. 7.</note>. Being ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally members of the church, but never born of God, they hate his true children. With their enſlaving er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and will-worſhip, they go about to oppreſs and hinder them from their proper work. Sadly they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs and wound them, reproach their conduct, expoſe them to injury, and attempt to rob them of their all-covering vail, Chriſt and his righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They are repreſented as Chriſt's COMPANIONS or rivals <note n="b" place="bottom">Song i. 8.</note>. Whatever love to, and connection with him, they pretend; they heartily hate him; ſet themſelves on a level with him; ſeek to undermine his intereſt, and deſpoil him of his ſubjects, his bride. Never, O Jeſus, permit me, whoriſhly and wickedly, to turn aſide by their numerous flocks.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They are repreſented as THIEVES and ROBBERS <note n="c" place="bottom">John x. 1.</note>. Without any regular miſſion from Chriſt, or call from his people, how often they ruſh into the miniſterial func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! How often they rob the Redeemer of his due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as ruler, as prieſt, or prophet of his church! How wickedly they rob the ſaints of their ſpiritual privileges, and confer them upon others! rob men of their goſpel-proviſion! and attempt to ſell them into the ſlavery of Satan!</p>
               <p n="9">9. They are called DECEIVERS and SEDUCERS <note n="d" place="bottom">2 Tim. iii. 13.</note>. They deceitfully mingle the goſpel of Chriſt with their own inventions; and, having thus corrupted it, impoſe it upon their hearers for pure and genuine truth. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der high pretences to friendſhip, to piety, to peace, to knowledge, or zeal, they decoy men into corruption and error; and bring on themſelves and their followers ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They are repreſented as BLIND WATCHMEN; BLIND GUIDES <note n="e" place="bottom">Iſ. lvi. 10.</note>. Being deſtitute of the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jeſus, and his truth, they preſumptuouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to direct the principles and practice of others; and with them fall into ſudden ruin.</p>
               <p n="11">11. They are repreſented as IDOL SHEPHERDS <note n="f" place="bottom">Zech. xi. 17.</note>. They are but the ſhadows and images of true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miniſters. Their followers, they ſeduce into the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0052801100:229"/>
paſtures of vain imaginations, and paths of ſpiritual, or groſs idolatry, and alienation from God.</p>
               <p n="12">12. They are called HIRELINGS <note n="a" place="bottom">John x. 12.</note>. Not from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine affection to Jeſus or his people, do they labour in the miniſtry; but to procure carnal favour, honour, pleaſure, or gain. And in times of perſecution and trouble, how readily they deſert their flocks, and the doctrines of truth!</p>
               <p n="13">13. They are repreſented as FOOLISH BUILDERS <hi>of hay and ſtubble</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="bottom">1 Cor. iii. 12.</note>. How light, empty, and worthleſs are the falſe doctrines, the corrupt practices; which, with great care, and apparent ſkill, they eſtabliſh, preach, and promote, as if founded on the perſon and authority of Chriſt! And how incapable to abide the trial of his word!</p>
               <p n="14">14 They are repreſented as DAUBERS <hi>with untemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mortar</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="bottom">Ezek. xii. 10.</note>. By their falſe and inconſiſtent tenets and conduct, they exert themſelves to confirm the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſin; in their dependence on ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and to ſhake, to raze, the hopes of the ſaints founded on Jeſus promiſe, perſon, and blood But ſpeedily ſhall their management be expoſed to their ſhame; and iſſue in their, and their followers, everlaſting ruin.</p>
               <p n="15">15. They are repreſented as CANAANITES and MER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHANTS <note n="d" place="bottom">Zech. xiv. 21. 2 Pet. ii. 3.</note>. Sprung from a curſed root, with what fraud and covetouſneſs, they, for carnal advantage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, corrupt, and miſapply the oracles of God! How often they diſpenſe his ſacred inſtitutions to unfit perſons, or in an improper form! How often they pretend to confer ſpiritual favours! And by other like methods, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbered, deceive and ruin the ſouls of men!</p>
               <p n="16">16. They are compared to ROARING LIONS <note n="e" place="bottom">Ezek. xxii. 25.</note>. With what boldneſs, fierceneſs, and cruelty, they roar out their errors and curſes; vent their perſecuting threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings, and malice againſt the faithful! And ſpread ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and deſtruction among men!</p>
               <p n="17">17. They are called WOLVES <note n="f" place="bottom">Matth. x. 16.</note>. Alas! how they love the darkneſs of ignorance, and ſhun the light of God's word! What a terror to watchful, or walking
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0052801100:230"/>
ſaints! How greedily, cruelly, and craftily, they deſtroy the church of God, and the ſpiritual lives and intereſts of men!</p>
               <p n="18">18. They are called FOXES <note n="a" place="bottom">Song ii. 15.</note>. How unclean; noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; abominable! How ſubtlely they ſhun the light of inſpiration or conviction! With what amazing greed, covetouſneſs, cruelty, and craft; and with what ſhifts, evaſions, and ſelf-inconſiſtencies, unnumbered, they, eſpecially in the night of perſecution, trouble, or carnal ſecurity,—ſpoil God's vineyard! unſettle weak and young profeſſors! ruin mens ſouls! and promote Satan's intereſts; till they be reſtrained by providence, checked by faithful cenſure, or cut off by death! And ah, how often are they proudly ſtupid under theſe checks!</p>
               <p n="19">19. They are repreſented as LAZY, GREEDY, DUMS DOGS <note n="b" place="bottom">Iſ. lvi. 10. 11.</note>. How filthy; ready to return to the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which they once ſeemed to recant and abhor! How malicious their enmity againſt Jeſus Chriſt, his miniſters, and people! How ready to bite and devour the ſouls of men; to raiſe a noiſe of perſecution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach againſt the cauſe of God, and its adherents! How ſlothful in every thing truly good and expedient! How covetous of ſome carnal enjoyment! How ready to hurt him, that putteth not into their mouth! How negligent to reprove and warn the unruly! Nay, how ready to connive at, and flatter them; chiefly if powerful and rich!</p>
               <p n="20">20. They, chiefly the Antichriſtians, are likened to SCORPIONS <note n="c" place="bottom">Rev. ix. 3. 5. 6.</note>. What diſtinguiſhed ſeed of the old ſerpent! How eaſily provoked to the moſt outragious fury againſt God and his church! with what pretences of piety and peace they vail and cover their error and wickedneſs! How ſubtlely; how inceſſantly, they ſmite their oppoſers with the vileſt reproach; the cruelleſt perſecution; and the heavieſt cenſures! With what quickneſs and craft, they inſtil the poiſon of error and abomination into their followers! And how DIVinely are they reſtrained from poiſoning and ruining the ſaints!</p>
               <p n="21">21. They, chiefly the Antichriſtians, are marked out
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0052801100:231"/>
by the LOCUSTS in the apocalyptic viſion of the fifth trumpet <note n="a" place="bottom">Rev. ix. 3. 7.—10.</note>. From the infernal ſmoke of ignorance and error, they derive their origin.

How noted their plauſible pretences to piety; their affected courteſy; their luſtful effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; their fawning flattery and ſmoothneſs; and their enticing of multitudes to ſpiritual whoredom! How di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed their cruelty and fraud in deſtroying the ſouls, the bodies, and the eſtates of men! How breaſt-plated with hardneſs of heart, ſearedneſs of conſcience, and with civil and eccleſiaſtic laws and immunities in their favour! And with what noiſy novelty, terror, curſes, perſecutions, anathemas, do they proceed in their infernal courſe, till the period aſſigned them by God, come to an end!</p>
               <p n="22">22. They are called FROGS <note n="b" place="bottom">Rev. xvi. 13. 2 Tim. iii. 6.</note>. How filthy are their heart and life! How fooliſh their talking!

And, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, amidſt ſummer-ſhowers of fat benefices, to creep abroad; to inſinuate themſelves into the families and hearts of men; into the chambers and ſecret councils of the wealthy and great.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THE church, in connection with her head, is called CHRIST <note n="a" place="bottom">1 Cor. xii. 12.</note>. Jeſus is her head, huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and <hi>all in all.</hi> From his love, his blood, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, and Spirit, ſhe wholly proceeds. To him, as proprietor, ſhe wholly pertains. To his perſon every true member is united. And to his honour do all her ſaints, her laws, her ordinances, and offices tend.</p>
               <p n="2">2. She is compared to a HUMAN BODY, or WOMAN <note n="b" place="bottom">Song i. 5. 8. 9. 10. 11. 13. and iv. 1.—5. and vi. 5. 6. 7. and vii. 1.—5. and v. 2.

She conſiſts of innumerable members, all cloſely connected with him, and with one another; who feel one another's affliction, ſympathize with one another's infirmities, care for one another's welfare, and are in conſtant readineſs to ſerve one another. Gradually ſhe increaſeth in ſtrength and extent; till ſhe attain the perfect ſtature of the glorified ſtate. Like a woman, ſhe is ſubject to manifold weakneſs and trouble on earth. Chriſt himſelf being her <hi>head,</hi> her <hi>eyes</hi> may ſignify her illuminating doctrines founded in him; or her miniſters, who, being rooted and grounded in him, ſignally adorn her appearance, obſerve and direct her members, watch againſt her enemies, expreſs her ſorrows, and pry into the myſteries of the goſpel. Her <hi>hair</hi> may ſignify her converts, eſpecially young ones, who, however weak and eaſily toſſed, are by faith fixed in Chriſt; like <hi>locks,</hi> knit to one another in love, and are an ornament and honour to Chriſt, and his church.

The Gentile world was long a <hi>barren woman,</hi> which brought forth no children to God; but now produceth more than the Jewiſh, which was long the Lord's eſpouſed bride. The goſpel-church is a <hi>free mother,</hi> freed from the law as a covenant, and from the yoke of ancient ceremonies: ſhe <hi>travails in pain</hi> by ſpiritual pains, and endurance of manifold trouble and perſecution: the <hi>man children</hi> brought forth by her, are Jeſus, with his honoured agent Conſtantine, the firſt Chriſtian emperor, and his other bold and reſolute ſaints: theſe are <hi>caught up to God, and to his throne;</hi> Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to his right hand; Conſtantine to the imperial throne; the primitive ſaints to the celeſtial manſions; or ſpecially honoured and protected on earth.

In her are ſaints, young and old; weak and ſtrong: to each is DIVinely appointed his proper work, ſtation, and privilege; and how comely, when with order, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſkill and delight, they apply themſelves thereto!

All of them are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Jeſus' authority, and bound to advance his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: To them, in very different degrees, he intruſts the talents and pounds of office, opportunity, gifts, and graces, that they may occupy therewith, till he come again: Such as improve them, ſhall be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally honoured and rewarded: ſuch as do not, but, as it were, <hi>hide</hi> them <hi>in a napkin,</hi> ſhall be ſelf-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and caſt into eternal ruin.

By the ſovereign power, and free grace of God, are her true members digged from their natural ſtate, and brought from among the reſidue of mankind. Implored by her fervent prayers, ſhall the righteous Lord bring terrible deſtruction upon her oppoſers. When wealthieſt empires are overturned, ſhe, however ſmall and deſpiſed, ſhall continue, and gain ground by their ruin.

The heart of her choſen members he plows up; removes their ſtony hardneſs; and every other bar in his way. Regularly he plants her with his ſaints, his ordinances and grace. By the hedge of government and diſcipline, he defends and ſeparates her from the reſt of the world. By the ſhining of his countenance, and the application of his love, he warms and nouriſheth her. With the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the rain, the dew of his word and Spirit, he waters

her every moment. With his truths and bleſſings, he fattens her. By his angels, his miniſters, his providence, he watcheth over, and keeps her night and day, leſt any hurt her. How dear is ſhe to him! and how he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to walk in her! What officers and members he hires to labour in her! No feed, but that of his word, he allows to be caſt into her. To none, but the choice ſeed of his ſaints, he allows acceſs to her fealing ordinances. By a faithful adminiſtration of his inſtitutions, and by manifold perſecutions and afflictions, he weeds and prunes off her corruptions. Every plant, or member is required to bring forth much fruit. And to what diſtreſs, ſpiritual drought, and everlaſting dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, doth their want of it expoſe them! How often, for cumbering his ground, for living unprofitably and wickedly in his church, doth he cut down profeſſors, and caſt them into endleſs ſire! How often, for their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual barrenneſs, and noxious corruptions, he unhingeth particular churches! takes away their hedge of protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and government! gives them up to Heatheniſh, and other abominations! and ſuffers the wild beaſts of wicked men to waſte and deform them at pleaſure! No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where are ſuch noxious weeds, ſuch corruptions produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as in an uncultivated church. How quickly the nettles and briers of hereſies, hateful practices, and wicked men cover her face, and render her a lodging of Satan, and his ſerpentine ſeed! The church is indeed ſmaller, but more uſeful than all the reſt of the world. For, like a <hi>vineyard of red wine,</hi> amidſt bloody perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe produceth perſons and works, which cheer the heart of God and man: Like an <hi>orchard of pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates, ſpikenard, and all the chief ſpices,</hi> ſhe produceth ſaints unnumbered, precious, ſavoury, and uſeful, and in attainments and conditions, very DIVerſified.

The <hi>keepers</hi> and <hi>huſband-men,</hi> to whom Chriſt lets out his vineyard, are her offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who are to cultivate her, and return him proper revenues of honour for the talents, opportunities, and charge affigned them.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0052801100:246"/>
Gentiles! Chriſt's having her <hi>at Baal-Hamon,</hi> imports, that now the acceſs to her is large; and multitudes enter. His <hi>having a thouſand, and the keepers two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> implies that he is to have the chief glory; and his miniſters their reſpective ſubſiſtence and honour. His <hi>hiring labourers to work in her at the third, the ſixth, the ninth, and eleventh hour,</hi> implies, that in different ages of the world, as the patriarchal, ceremonial, apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic, and millennial; and in very different ſeaſons of life, his choſen are converted, and made to labour in his work; and at the end, all of them ſhall receive the <hi>penny,</hi> the enriching, the gracious reward of eternal life.

Some of it falls upon carnal worldlings, whoſe thorns, whoſe earthly cares and luſts, choke and render it unfruitful.

In her grows up the <hi>good wheat,</hi> the ſaints ſown by Jeſus Chriſt; and the <hi>tares,</hi> hypocrites, and ſeducers, ſown by Satan in the night of ignorance, indifferency, trouble, or time. Nor men, nor angels, can, or are now DIVinely warranted, fully to ſeparate the <hi>tares</hi> from the <hi>wheat.</hi> But, at the laſt-judgment, a full, a final ſeparation ſhall be effected; the ſaints being gathered into God's hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſtorehouſe, and the wicked caſt into unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fire.</p>

corn of grace and chaff of corruption cleave cloſe to one another; and by threſhing influences, troubles, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, her ordinary attendants, muſt the chaff be gradually ſeparated from the wheat.

Bleſſed Boaz, it is thine to lodge on this thy <hi>floor,</hi> which thou haſt choſen, purchaſed, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. It is thine to purge it with the fan of thy word, of thine influences, and of ſtormy providences.

Her ſituation on the <hi>ſouth ſide of an hill,</hi> may denote her free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the chilling blaſts of perſecution and trouble; and her eminent enjoyment of the influences of her all-warming Sun of righteouſneſs.

Its <hi>ſtairs</hi> of aſcent at the threſholds, ſignify our gradual increaſe in gifts and grace; and our gradual entrance into the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and inviſible church, and to fellowſhip with God; and the various means of obtaining it.

And the <hi>ſeparate building</hi> at the weſt end, the eternal ſtate of glory, which eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard; nor hath it entered into the heart of men to conceive of. The <hi>ſide-chambers</hi> of the temple and court, may ſignify particular churches, worſhipping aſſemblies, and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ordinances, where Jeſus reſides, and reveals his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; protects and allows intimate fellowſhip to his people. <hi>The enlarging of the upper ſtories of ſome of theſe chambers, by their jutting into the principal wall,</hi> implies, that the more holy, heavenly, and dependent upon God, churches and perſons are, in attending ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, the more extenſive is their goſpel-liberty. The <hi>prieſts chambers in the outward court towards the north,</hi> may mark their diſtinct functions in the church; or the Proteſtant churches in Europe and North America. Their <hi>narrowing as they aſcended,</hi> implies their being the more expoſed to perſecution, according to their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency; or that, in the Proteſtant churches, there ſhall be great decays, as to number and quality; and that in the ſecond, and eſpecially the third age after the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, few eminent members or miniſters ſhall be therein found. The <hi>void places between and before the chambers,</hi> may repreſent the abundant acceſs there is to Chriſtian churches and ordinances; the light, liberty, and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome air of influence there enjoyed; and that our whole life is to be an improving of ordinances paſt, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for theſe in view.

of churches and miniſters; and the ſubſtantial identity of ordinances. The <hi>poſts and pillars</hi> in this temple, may repreſent fundamental truths, evangelical promiſes, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miniſters, and zealous ſaints; which eſtabliſh and ſtrengthen the church. <hi>Cherubims and palm trees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately mixed,</hi> may repreſent miniſters and ſaints at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by angels; and all prying into the myſteries of redemption, ſtying in the active ſervice of God, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently bearing loads of labour and trouble, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing victory over ſpiritual enemies. The <hi>foundations and pavement</hi> may repreſent Chriſt, and his inſpired oracles, as the foundation of the church, and of every true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, grace, and good work, therein. The large <hi>gates, doors,</hi> and <hi>porches,</hi> ſignify Chriſt as the means of our abundant acceſs to God. But the <hi>porch of the ſanctuary</hi> may exhibit him as a ſupporter, hiding-place, and houſe of prayer, for his people: and the appropriation of <hi>the eaſt gate to the prince alone,</hi> may ſignify, that he alone approacheth ſtraight forward to God, by his own merit; and is the Head of the church, who may go in and out from his people and ordinances, as he pleaſeth. <hi>The windows</hi> may repreſent miniſters and ordinances, by means of which we ſhare the light and air of life. The <hi>identity of things, and meaſures on various ſides,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits the identity of Chriſt, and his word and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and the ſimilarity of his people in every part of the world. The <hi>altar of burnt-offering,</hi> repreſents Jeſus in his all-purchaſing blood and righteouſneſs. <hi>That of incenſe</hi> repreſents him in his all-procuring interceſſion. The <hi>chamber for waſhing the ſacrifices,</hi> may denote the ordinance of baptiſm, in which the ſaints, theſe ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al oblations, are waſhed by the blood and Spirit of the Lamb. The <hi>eight tables of hewn ſtone, with the knives on them,</hi> may ſignify the DIVinely appointed, the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and often-diſpenſed ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper, in which Chriſt crucified, and our ſins, the cauſe of his death, are affectingly preſented to our ſpiritual view. And may not the <hi>fleſh-hooks</hi> denote the promiſes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the goſpel, as exhibiting and bringing near to us, our crucified Redeemer? May not the <hi>ſingers and Levites</hi> ſignify true Chriſtians, who rejoice in, bleſs the Lord, and labour in his ſervice? May not the <hi>prieſts</hi>

May not the <hi>five hundred reeds of meaſure on every ſide of the court,</hi> ſignify the extent of the church in the latter-days; and the conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to be kept up between her and the world?

To prevent her decay and ruin, how frequently is ſhe repaired with new generations of ſaints, and ſupplies of grace! Her <hi>being founded on the tops of the mountains, and exalted above the hills,</hi> implies, that, remaining for ever founded on Jeſus Chriſt, the Rock of ſalvation, ſhe ſhall be moſt firmly and conſpicuouſly ſettled in the world, that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes may flow unto her.

The Jews are the ELDER, the Gentiles the YOUNGER. The former, God, by his word, required to <hi>work in the vineyard</hi> of his church. Fairly they engaged, and readily they promiſed, to ſerve him; but quickly broke their engagement. Long the latter lived in open rebellion; but, at laſt, influenced by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting grace, they repented and complied with his call. Long, like prodigals, they deſerted their Father's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and church, till deep ſenſe of their ſpiritual need brought them to themſelves, and made them enquire what they ſhould do to be ſayed. How readily then did JEHOVAH meet them in mercy! embraced them with love! arrayed them with the <hi>beſt robe</hi> of his ſons righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs! feaſted them with his fleſh and blood! adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with his ordinances and influences! But why, ye Jews, did you repine at his honouring them above you, who had long been his peculiar children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants!

He took no peculiar notice of them; brought them into no church-relation to him.

                  <p n="2">2. It is repreſented as God's WAY; PATH; GOINGS; and FOOTSTEPS <note n="a" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxvii. 19.</note>. Herein with pleaſure he diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his power, and gradually fulfils his purpoſe. He <hi>cometh</hi> to men, to relieve, comfort, and puniſh them. He <hi>turns away</hi> from men, by deſertion, or by forbearing to puniſh. His <hi>way is in the ſea,</hi> and <hi>his footſteps not known;</hi> when it is hard to underſtand the nature and tendency of his providences; or ſee his perfections diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played therein. His <hi>paths drop down fatneſs,</hi> when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences concur to our comfort; or when the clouds pour down their refreſhful and nouriſhing dew and rain. To <hi>look after God;</hi> or <hi>ſee his goings,</hi> is, with reverence, attention, and delight, to obſerve, conſider, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the works of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God's providence is compared to CLOUDS <note n="b" place="bottom">Iſ. xix. 1. Pſal. xcvii. 2.</note>. How lofty; marvellous; and incomprehenſible! How pregnant with events! How ſwift and DIVinely directed the motions of it! To the wicked, how terrible the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and ſometimes the appearance! To the ſaints how refreſhful and fructifying!—When I ſee the moſt black, diſmal, and louring providences of God, gilded with the <hi>rainbow</hi> of his covenant, or his <hi>Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> how reviving and reſtoring it is to my heart! THEN am I <hi>alſo among the prophets;</hi> know that all things ſhall work together for my good.

                  <p n="5">5. It may be compared to WHEELS <note n="a" place="bottom">Ezek. i.</note>; to repreſent the quick and eaſy motion; and the myſterious nature, and frequent changes of it. How quickly it humbles the lofty, and exalts ſuch as are low! Like the wheels of a machine, how exactly it regulates all things in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! Theſe wheels having <hi>four faces,</hi> may mark out providence, as reſpecting all the ends of the earth; and as exerciſed with great tenderneſs, patience, knowledge, and power. Their <hi>uniform likeneſs,</hi> imports the uniform tendency of providences. Their appearance as of a <hi>wheel within a wheel,</hi> imports its myſterious and intricate conduct. The <hi>height of their rings, and their being full of eyes,</hi> may ſignify the tremendous nature of, and the infinite knowledge diſcovered in, providence.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THE covenant of works made with Adam, and all his ſeed in him, is called a LAW <note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 19. 10.</note>. It comprehended the whole duty of man; was inforced with DIVine authority; was not an agreement betwixt, equals, but enjoined by God to man as his ſubject. It is called a <hi>fiery law.</hi> Amidſt fiery flames, it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed from Sinai; it occaſions fiery rage in our heart againſt God; and worketh for us, a fiery and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruin. It is a law <hi>weak through the fleſh,</hi> as by reaſon of our corruption, it cannot juſtify or ſave us. It is a <hi>law of ſin and death,</hi> as by it the offence abounds; and ſin reigns unto death, temporal, ſpiritual, and eternal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is repreſented as a RIGID MASTER <note n="b" place="bottom">Rom. vii. 8.</note>. How extenſive and hard are its requirements of us! Without affording or allowing us any ſpiritual ſtrength, or nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, it demands that we ſhould perfectly fulfil its precepts, holy, juſt, and good, ſpiritual, and exceeding broad; and ſatisfy its unbounded penalty for our paſt offences. If we continue not in all things commanded; if we keep it not conſtantly in every point and degree; it curſeth us to endleſs miſery; and employeth our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to eondemn, laſh, and torment us.—Alas! O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, how long I fooliſhly preferred this hard bondage to thy eaſy yoke and light burden!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is repreſented as a HUSBAND <note n="c" place="bottom">Rom. vii. 1.—4.</note>. We were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly married to it in Adam.

Ah! their ſorry wages! To them is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever! Yet the ſlavery being natural, how is it loved and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed! Notwithſtanding all that God hath done for my ſoul; notwithſtanding his changing and emptying me from veſſel to veſſel, what remains of this mother's blood runs ſtill in my veins! How my comfort ebbs and flows with my frame! the challenges of my conſcience mar my believing aſſurance! the prevalence of ſin, or pride of grace, cheeks my exerciſe of faith on Chriſt! my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in duty mar my peace!

Here I behold him ALL IN ALL, even of my gloomy croſs! Here I ſee JEHOVAH'S bow inverted; his wrath turned away from me, and pointed againſt the prince of the power of the air, and my other enemies.

                  <p n="5">5. It is compared to a HEDGE <note n="a" place="bottom">Eccleſ. x. 18.</note>. Thereby God limits our motions, and points out, whether we may, or may not go. To what hurt in his work, and what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in the iſſue, doth the breaker of it expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! The old ſerpent, the devil, the ſerpent of a ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcience, and the ſerpent of God's judgments, ſhall bite him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is repreſented as a YOKE; BANTS; CORDS <note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. ii. 3.</note>. By DIVine authority, it reſtrains our ſinful liberty and madneſs; and keeps us to our ſtation and work. How galling to our corrupt nature and luſts! and at what endleſs peril, we attempt to ſhake it off, by refuſing obedience to it! The law as a rule, in the hand of Chriſt, is an <hi>eaſy yoke and light burden;</hi> it is lined with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming love, ſweetened with his pattern, attended with communication of his ſtrength, and enforced with a glorious and free reward, to the weakeſt attempt, if ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, to draw therein.—Why then, my ſoul, art thou as an unruly <hi>bullock unaccuſtomed to this yoke?</hi> Why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny criminal attempts to ſhake off the yoke, and burſt the bands? why this reſiſting of the Lord, and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling to evade his authority? Is it not HE, who lays my <hi>meat,</hi> my <hi>life,</hi> my <hi>all,</hi> to me? The law, of ceremonies, and <hi>as a covenant of works, is a yoke of bondage:</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chained down to burdenſome ſervices innumerable; and the latter rigorouſly demands what we can never perform.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is called the LAW OF LIBERTY <note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. ii. 3.</note>. To obey it as a rule, is the privilege of thoſe only whom God's <hi>(c)</hi> Jam. i. 25.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0052801100:313"/>
Son hath made <hi>free indeed.</hi> The obedience of love to it as a rule, ſprings from our freedom from the law as a covenant, and is the very quinteſſence of our honourable and delightful liberty.—Lord, my true freedom from ſinful ſlavery lies in being thy filial ſubject. Truly I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant; thou haſt looſed my <hi>bands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is called the ROYAL LAW <note n="a" place="bottom">Jam. ii. 8.</note>. Being eſtabliſhed by God, the univerſal Sovereign, it extends to all his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſubjects; nor, without high treaſon, can it be broken. <hi>It is not made for a righteous man,</hi> is not made to curſe and condemn him. Nor have the truly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous nation any immediate connection with it, <hi>as a covenant,</hi> it being dead to them, and they to it, by Jeſus Chriſt's fulfilling it in their ſtead.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The law of the wiſe is called a FOUNTAIN <hi>of life</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Prov. xiii. 14.</note>. The DIVine law, which every wiſe man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to, as his rule, and the inſtructions which wiſe men give to others, are means of exciting them to apply to Chriſt, the reſurrection and the life; means of quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reviving, and reſtoring ſpiritual life; means of mens eſcaping the ſecond death, and preparing for life eternal.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The ceremonial law is called CARNAL <hi>ordinances,</hi> and <hi>a</hi> CARNAL <hi>commandment</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">Heb. ix. 10. and vii. 16.</note>. It preſcribed carnal and fleſhly rites; and carnal or natural deſcent entitled to the privileges thereof.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The ceremonial law is called a PARTITION-WALL <note n="d" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 14. 15.</note>; becauſe of the great diſtinction which it made between the Jews and Gentiles; nor, till Jeſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and aboliſhed it by his death, was any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of Gentiles brought into the church of God.</p>

The ſacrifices therein required, manifeſted God's indignation at ſin, and the enmity between him and ſinful men. Its burdenſome ſervices occaſioned the Jews hatred of God to increaſe more and more. The diſtinction it put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jews and Gentiles, occaſioned enmity between the two.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The goſpel is called the SPIRIT <hi>that giveth life</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Cor. iii. 6.</note>. It contains ſpiritual bleſſings and promiſes. It comes from, is attended by, and is the great means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit of God to us. It effectually penetrates our ſoul and ſpirit. By it the Holy Ghoſt quickens dead ſinners, ſhews them their way of life by Chriſt; heals their deadly, their ſinful wounds; works a lively faith in their ſoul, to look to, and live upon him. It is the food that ſupports the ſpiritual life; the cordial, that revives and reſtores the heart under every drooping circumſtance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is repreſented as the WHITE HORSE, upon which Chriſt and his people ride <note n="b" place="bottom">Rev. vi. 2. and xix. 14.</note>. O its purity, glory, and comelineſs! By it Jeſus proclaims peace to men, and ſubdues them to himſelf. On this, in the apoſtolic age, he went forth conquering; and in the Millennium he ſhall go forth, more eminently, to conquer the hearts of his people. Then, in accompliſhment of, and as animated, ſupported, and dignified, by goſpel-promiſes, ſhall mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes follow him, and promote the deſtruction of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It reſembles <hi>Solomon's</hi> CHARIOT <hi>of the wood of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">Song iii. 5. 10.</note>. Being framed by Jeſus, for the ſafe, the eaſy, and honoured conqueſt, and conveyance of his people to heaven; how pure, precious, glorious, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, and laſting! Its <hi>pillars of ſilver,</hi> are its comely, uſeful, and enriching truths and promiſes. Its <hi>bottom of gold,</hi> is its ſubſtantial and precious foundation-truths, or the infinitely precious perſon of Chriſt, and God in him. Its <hi>covering of purple,</hi> is the doctrine of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Jeſus' blood; and of the croſs endured for his ſake. Its <hi>inward pavement of love,</hi> is the unmatched kindneſs and mercy of God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, running through every truth and promiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Its promiſes are like LILIES <note n="d" place="bottom">Song ii. 7. and vii 2.</note>. O their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs,

How condeſcendent, and ſuited to our low, our wretched condition!—Bleſſed field of inſpiration, how theſe every where abound! How they bend their bleſſed head towards mean, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed, <hi>earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh</hi> me! How they refreſh mine eyes, and rejoice my heart! How rank they ſmell of Jeſus, the Lily of the valley! And truly, as lilies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thorns, ſo are they to my ſoul, amidſt her troubles, and her created comforts.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is called the GRACE <hi>of God that bringeth ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and GREAT SALVATION <note n="a" place="bottom">Tit. ii. 11. Heb. ii. 3.</note>. It flows from, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and includes the rich, free, and undeſerved favour of God, and the bleſſed fruits thereof. It publiſhes, brings near, offers, and is the means of applying, a coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, extenſive, and everlaſting ſalvation to men.—Truſt thyſelf, my ſoul, to this word of his grace, fail not of this grace, nor receive it in vain; let it enter and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate my heart; ſo ſhall I never be a root of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, bearing gall and wormwood, whereby many are defiled.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is called the POWER <hi>of God unto ſalvation</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Rom. i. 16.</note>. By it, God diſplays his amazing power, in the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, in the purchaſe, and application of our redemption. Thereby he exerts the exceeding greatneſs of his power, in convincing, in converting, in forgiving, ſanctifying, and comforting his people. By means of it our rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion is quaſhed; our enmity ſlain; Satan diſlodged; corruption ſubdued; bars of iron, and gates of braſs, ſtrong impediments, broken and removed; nations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; men, furious as outragious beaſts, tamed; and deep-rooted and earneſtly-held abominations, aboliſhed. Come, bleſſed <hi>day of power;</hi> come forth, <hi>bleſſed rod of Jeſus' ſtrength,</hi> then ſhall the people be willing; God ſhall raiſe children out of worſe than ſtones to Abraham. Nothing is too hard, when his power is preſent to heal them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is called the WISDOM <hi>of God in a myſtery; the manifold</hi> WISDOM <hi>of God</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">1 Cor. i. 7. Eph. iii. 10.</note>. How <hi>manifold</hi> its doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines

and promiſes! How manifold the inſtances and rays of DIVine wiſdom in each! and the various times and ſeaſons in which, and perſons to which, it is diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! It diſcovers how wiſely JEHOVAH acted, in chuſing the perſons, in whoſe redemption grace would peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhine; in founding his choice upon his own mere love, that the promiſes might be ſure to all the ſeed; in laying our help upon one that is mighty, that it might never fail; in bringing about our ſalvation in a way, that produceth glory to himſelf in the higheſt, peace on earth, and good will towards men; in a way, by which Satan is ſhamed, ſin condemned, ſinners ſaved; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly juſtified, and ungodlineſs deſtroyed; iniquity for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and full vengeance taken on our inventions; in a way, by which our redemption is all of mercy, and all of juſtice; all of merit, and all of grace. O ſweet myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! beyond archangels comprehenſive ken!</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It may be called the KISSES <hi>of Chriſt's mouth</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Song i. 2.</note>. From him, its doctrines and promiſes proceed; and bear the ſtamp of his authority. How ſweetly they atteſt his peace and reconciliation! declare and vent his love! How effectually they delight our ſoul! raviſh our heart! and excite our affection and love to him!—Let Jeſus kiſs me, with one, with all <hi>the kiſſes of his mouth;</hi> apply one, apply all his promiſes to my heart, to kindle it wholly into a flame of love to himſelf!</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It is called a LAW <note n="b" place="bottom">Iſ. ii. 1. 2. Rev. vii. 2. and iii. 27.</note>. It is the will of a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign God, proclaiming his edicts of peace and pardon. It engageth him to beſtow his bleſſings on us; and binds and determines us to receive his grace, and obey his commands. Nor ſhall it ever be repealed, becauſe Jeſus <hi>hath an unchangeable prieſthood.</hi> It is the <hi>law of the Spirit of life in him,</hi> as by it, the Holy Ghoſt, as dwelling in, ſent by, and taking of the things of Chriſt, to ſhew them to us, begets, preſerves, reſtores, increaſeth, and perfects our ſpiritual life; ſecures us of, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares us for eternal life. It is the <hi>law of faith,</hi> the ſeed, the means, the ground and ſtandard of our faith. <hi>It comes forth out of Zion and Jeruſalem;</hi> flows from Chriſt as the temple and habitation of God; and from Jeruſalem did its New-Teſtament diſpenſation proceed,

and ſpread among the Gentiles.—O may I meditate on this law, day and night; may it be better to me, than <hi>thouſands of gold and ſilver!</hi>

O the neceſſary, the uſeful, the ſuitable, the important, the delightful, and raviſhing news which it brings from heaven to ſinful men! Tidings of righteouſneſs, pardon, and acceptance, to the guilty! Tidings of purification to the polluted! of health to the diſeaſed! of liberty to the enſlaved and impriſoned! of clothing to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked! of food to the hungry and ſtarving! of light to them that ſit in darkneſs of diſtreſs and ignorance! of riches to the poor, comfort to the mourner, peace to the traitor, life to the dead, and ſalvation to the loſt! How often have theſe good news from the far country been as cold water to my thirſty and weary ſoul! It is called the <hi>goſpel,</hi> or <hi>good tidings of God;</hi> it proceeds from him, declares his love and lovelineſs; promotes his honour, and brings men to him: It is called the <hi>goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> as he is the principal preacher, the ſubſtance and end of of it, in whom all the articles of it are <hi>yea and amen to the glory of God:</hi> It is called the <hi>goſpel of miniſters,</hi> as they preach and publiſh it. It is the <hi>goſpel of peace,</hi> as it proclaims the peace of God to us, and the means thereof; and reconciles our heart to him, and to one another in love. It is the <hi>goſpel of ſalvation,</hi> as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims, brings near, offers, exhibits, and is the means of applying, the great, the everlaſting ſalvation, to our ſoul. It is an <hi>everlaſting goſpel,</hi> as it ſhall be diſpenſed till the end of time; and its fruits ſhall remain for ever. It is the <hi>goſpel of the kingdom</hi> of grace; and which brings men, who believe it, to the kingdom of glory.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. It is called a MYSTERY <note n="b" place="bottom">Eph. iii. 9. 1 Tim. 3 iii. 16. Matth. xiii. 11.</note>. O the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible truths which it reveals! That there are three perſons in one Godhead, or DIVine eſſence: That the Son of God was manifeſt in the fleſh; ſuffered the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring ſinners to God; died for our offences, and roſe again for our juſtification; was exalted as a Prince and Saviour, to give us repentance and remiſſion of ſins; ſent to bleſs us, make us the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0052801100:318"/>
righteouſneſs of God in him, and dwell in our hearts by faith; that being crucified with Chriſt, we might live by faith on him, and have the world crucified to us, and we to the world. Is not every doctrine thereof an unſearchable deep, ſhown only by the Spirit of God, and which even a wiſe man cannot find out to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! O the height, the depth, the length, and breadth of the love, the wiſdom, and knowledge of God, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therein! It is the <hi>myſtery of godlineſs,</hi> which founds and promotes conformity to, and reverence of God; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in heart and life. The <hi>myſtery of the kingdom,</hi> known only in the kingdom of grace and glory. Pant thou, my ſoul, for the fellowſhip of this myſtery of Chriſt; with angels, deſire to look into it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. It is likened to a TRUMPET <note n="a" place="bottom">Iſ. xxvii. 12.</note>. With great ſkill it ought to be preached. How majeſtic and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant its joyful ſound! its agreeable declarations! How ſweetly! how loud it proclaims the approaches of King Jeſus to men! and their deliverance from ſin and wrath by him! Of what unbounded importance are its decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations! and how diſtinct! It warns us to flee from the wrath to come; invites us to Jeſus, the <hi>Saviour and great One.—</hi>Quickly may it be blown over all the earth; that ſuch as are ready to periſh, may come and worſhip before the Lord of hoſts.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. It is compared to RIVERS <hi>of living, and all-quickening water</hi>

By it Jeſus begets, preſerves, reſtores, promotes and perfects, the ſpiritual life of his people, and brings them to eternal life. <hi>This river proceeds from the temple, and runs by the altar of God;</hi> flows from his love, and through the blood and ſacrifice of his Son. <hi>Gradually it increaſeth from a bubbling drop to an unpaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſea.</hi> Before the flood, it was very ſmall in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but gradually it increaſed by new revelations, till, in the apoſtolic age, it became like a river.

It <hi>makes every thing to live whitherſoever it cometh;</hi> had, and ſhall have, an amazing ſucceſs in quickening dead ſinners, and reviving dying ſaints; but heals not <hi>mariſhy places</hi> of reprobate men. <hi>The flouriſhing and fruitful trees growing on the ſide of this river,</hi> are Jeſus the tree of life, and his comely and uſeful ſaints. <hi>The multitude of fiſhers from Engedi even unto Eneglaim, and the multitude of fiſhes caught by them in the dead ſea, when this river hath run into it,</hi> are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters preaching, and multitudes hearing and receiving the goſpel, through the world, from one end to the other. Its <hi>running both in ſummer and winter,</hi> implies its being conſtantly preached and applied, whether in times of proſperity or trouble, with the church, or any particular member thereof It <hi>maketh glad the city,</hi> the church <hi>of God,</hi> by its <hi>ſtreams</hi> of declarations, offers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations, and influences.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. It is a WELL, or <hi>wells of ſalvation</hi>

O their perpetual fulneſs of influence! of bleſſedneſs and ſalvation! How ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calculated to delight, refreſh, nouriſh, reſtore, heal, quicken, and fructify my heart!

                  <p n="15">15. The goſpel is compared to a NET <note n="b" place="bottom">Matth. xiii. 47. 48. 49.</note>. How cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious its frame and contexture!

With what ſkill, care, and vigour, it muſt be caſt and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in the preaching of it! To what fatigue and ſtorms, are its conſtant, its faithful preachers expoſed! How ſeldom, they, <hi>at firſt,</hi> perceive their ſucceſs in preaching it! It is the ſtated means of drawing ſinners out of their natural and worldly ſtate, to Jeſus Chriſt. Fiſhes ſmall and great, ſinners leſs or greater, perſons poor or rich, are caught therein. Teach thy miniſters, O Jeſus, to caſt this net on the right ſide of the ſhip, that a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude may be incloſed; it is impoſſible the net can

Then ſhall the good fiſh, ſuch men as were caught by the heart, be conveyed to the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of God.

                  <p n="16">16. It is compared to a GRAIN <hi>of muſtard-ſeed, which grows up into a very large ſtalk</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Matth. xiii. 31. 32.</note>.

To what mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes is it the means of refreſhing and comfort! What numbers ſhall profeſs ſubjection to it! How increaſing its influence in our heart! At firſt, perhaps ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible, it quickly fills the whole. What multitudes of graces are refreſhed!

However un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant and deſpicable it be to carnal men; yet being inlaid in the world, it continueth to ſpread its influence, till the whole earth be filled with the knowledge of the Lord. Being inlaid in mens heart, it ſpreads its virtue, enlightening the mind, purifying the conſcience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the will, ſoftening the heart, inflaming the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and fixing the memory, till the whole be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſanctified.</p>

What raviſhing, though imperfect views of JEHOVAH, in his greatneſs and love; of Jeſus in his comelineſs, office, relations, righteouſneſs, power, and grace, do we here obtain! What proſpect of life and immortality! We look not at the things which are ſeen, which are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral; but at the things which are not ſeen, which are eternal; we ſee, that henceforth is laid up for us a crown of righteouſneſs; that we ſhall awake with Jeſus' likeneſs; and ſhall be for ever with, and like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</p>

                  <head>Metaphors reſpecting the goſpel-diſpenſation.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THE diſpenſation of God's grace, eſpecially under the New Teſtament, is called the KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM OF GOD; the KINGDOM OF HEAVEN <note n="a" place="bottom">Mark i. 14. and Matth. xx. 1.</note>. O the majeſtic ſovereignty, ſtate, and royalty of God therein manifeſted! O its beautiful order, ſtrength, and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! and the honourable privileges therein conferred! What multitudes are thereby connected, and united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Jeſus their head! God is the deviſer, the eſtabliſher, the manager, and his glory the end of it. It is heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in its origin; it reſembles heaven in holineſs, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and order; and prepares men for entrance into the heavenly inheritance of the ſaints in light. The New Teſtament diſpenſation is more God-like and heavenly than the Old; holineſs is the univerſal <hi>law of the houſe;</hi> and its privileges are more ſpiritual and ſanctifying.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The goſpel diſpenſation in the apoſtolic age is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as a MARRIAGE-DINNER; and that chiefly in the glorious Millennium, is called the MARRIAGE SUPPER <hi>of the Lamb</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Matth. xxii. 1.—14. Luke xiv. 15.—24. Rev. xix. 7.—9. Matth. viii. 11. 12.</note>. The former is indeed towards the end of time, but nearer its middle than the other, which ſhall but take place before the laſt judgment. God hath <hi>killed his oxen and ſatlings;</hi> hath ſlain his own Son, to he our proviſion; hath prepared all poſſible bleſſings; and invites every ſort of ſinners to eſpouſe his Son, and accept of his fulneſs. From trifling and carnal motives, the Jews, when firſt invited, refuſed to receive this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and favour; For this they were excluded from the church, and the ordinances thereof; themſelves maſſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the murdering Romans, and by one another; and their city burnt with fire. But thrice happy! God extended his invitations to the deſtitute, the wicked, and infamous Gentiles, in whatſoever city or nation they are found! O now our rich proviſion! our amazing
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0052801100:323"/>
joy and happineſs! our honourable fellowſhip with God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; with angels, ancient patriarchs, and eminent ſaints, while the Jewiſh <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the kingdom</hi> are caſt out! How fitly our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment prepareth us for our work in the end of the world! qualifieth us to lie down in our duſty beds of the grave! and to enter into our eternal reſt! How great JEHOVAH's earneſtneſs to have his houſe filled with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ſinners! Upon his invitations what multitudes have entered, and <hi>yet there is room.</hi> By ſetting before us the ſinfulneſs and miſery of our natural ſtate, Jeſus' excellency, ability, and readineſs to ſave, and uſing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry method to perſuade our conſcience, he requires his miniſterial ſervants <hi>to compel</hi> us to come in, that his houſe may be filled. But dreadful ſhall be our endleſs miſery, if we live in his church, without putting on his Son, as our <hi>righteouſneſs and ſanctification!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is repreſented as the <hi>letting out of a vineyard to huſbandmen</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Matth. xxi. 33.—43.</note>. In the ceremonial form thereof, God gave it to the Jews, and ſent his prophets to demand, that they ſhould give him the glory due to his name; theſe being injuriouſly maltreated, he ſent his Son, whom, it might have been expected, they would reverence and regard; but they murdered him, that they might live as they liſted. For theſe things God miſerably deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Jewiſh nation, and gave the goſpel to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that they might bring forth fruits of good works, anſwerable to it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is compared to the <hi>hiring of labourers at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hours, to work in a vineyard, and giving all equal wages</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Matth. xx. 1.—16.</note>. In the morning of the patriarchal, in the noon-tide of the ceremonial, at the <hi>ninth hour</hi> of the apoſtolic age, in the <hi>eleventh hour</hi> of the future Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, or thouſand years reign of the ſaints, multitudes are DIVinely invited, and brought to Chriſt, and to his work in the church. Nor ſhall the eternal bleſſedneſs of the former exceed that of the latter. Murmur not, ye Jews, <hi>who bore the burden</hi> of eremonial rites, <hi>and the heat</hi> of laborious ſervice; murmur not, ye primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who <hi>bore the burden</hi> of troubleſome work, and <hi>the heat</hi> of ſcorching perſecution; may not JEHOVAH do with
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0052801100:324"/>
his own as he pleaſeth? Is not the whole reward of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign grace? Let not your eye be evil, becauſe his is good. In the early morning of life, are not ſome; in its middle or noon are not others; in its evening of old age, are not others, though more rarely, called and drawn to Chriſt? May not a ſovereign God impart to all an equal ſhare of his endleſs bliſs; his gracious reward?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is compared to a <hi>great man's giving pounds or talents to his ſervants, as he departs to a far country, that they may occupy till he return, call them to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and render them rewards, according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective improvement</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Matth. xxv. 14.—30. Luke xix 11.—27.</note>. Aſcending up on high, to receive for himſelf a kingdom, Jeſus committed to men, the precious and uſeful <hi>pounds</hi> and <hi>talents</hi> of DIVine ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of goſpel ordinances, of manifold opportunities of grace and happineſs, of holy offices, gifts, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; to ſome in a greater, to others in a leſſer degree. Theſe he requires them to improve, <hi>alway abounding in the work of the Lord.</hi> At the end, he will come, and reckon with them. Such as having real grace, have improven their talents, ſhall be highly and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rewarded with everlaſting honour and joy. Such as, having no real grace, through hard thoughts of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, have not improved their gifts, offices, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, ſhall be ſelf-condemned, and caſt into endleſs miſery.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In the end of the world, it is like to <hi>the calling of wiſe and fooliſh virgins to meet the Bridegroom</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Matth. xxv. 1.—13.</note>. Though, church-members be like virgins in outward purity, in blameleſſneſs of life, and ſoundneſs of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in apparent modeſty, and ſelf-denial; yet alas how many of them are not <hi>wiſe unto ſalvation!</hi> What multitudes fooliſhly name the name of Chriſt, without receiving him into their heart! At the end of time, how dreadful ſhall be the ſloth and ſecurity, of both ſaints and hypocrites! Ere they are aware, Chriſt ſhall ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon them to judgment. Happy then, thoſe, who have <hi>oil</hi> of true grace, attending their lamps of profeſſion! their glory ſhall be brightneſs; their lamps trimmed; their grace perfected; and themſelves ſhall enter into
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0052801100:325"/>
immediate and everlaſting fellowſhip with Chriſt! but oh unhappy theſe, who have lamps, but no ſaving grace! None can then be given them; no creature ſhall be able or willing to help them. They ſhall be irreverſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the fellowſhip of Chriſt; and ſhut up in everlaſting torments, where there ſhall be <hi>weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The goſpel-ſtate of the New-Teſtament church is repreſented as a REST <note n="a" place="bottom">Heb. iv. 3.</note>. How fully is our free and complete juſtification through the blood of Jeſus therein diſplayed! and how powerfully applied! how happily we are therein liberated from that ſervile frame of ſpirit, which was ſo common to the Jews, in their worſhip! The yoke of troubleſome ceremonies is no more impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; nor is our conſcience burdened or perplexed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the punctual obſervance thereof. But the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eaſy inſtitutions of the goſpel, attended with gracious freedom, ſtrength, and aſſiſtance, are come in their room. Bleſſed reſt of heaven! bleſſed form of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, never to be changed in time, and wherein JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH manifeſts his reſt in Chriſt, and in his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us!</p>

Where ſin reigned unto death, it reigns through righteouſneſs unto eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt. With what amazing glory and ſovereignty, it acts; and doth whatſoever it pleaſeth! Every DIVine perſon, perfection, purpoſe, and providence, concurs to promote its honour. Every creature is employed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance its deſigns. It conquers every foe; ſubdues to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf every choſen ſinner of mankind; rules with abſolute dominion in every ſaint; and receives from him a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of endleſs praiſe.</p>

It bears down all oppoſition; waſheth away every ſtain; covers every mountain of guilt and miſery; ſpreads into every perſon, power, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, of an elect world, and maketh glad the whole city of our God.—Bleſſed river! boundleſs ocean! be thou the ſole ſource of my happineſs.

                  <p n="1">1. The change of our ſtate is repreſented as a CALL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING <note n="c" place="bottom">Heb. iii. 1</note>. By Jeſus' goſpel-invitation, we are therein
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0052801100:334"/>
powerfully called, and drawn from Satan to God; from darkneſs and ignorance to God's marvellous light; from ſin to purity and holineſs; from miſery to happineſs; from earth to heaven; in fine, from the fellowſhip of the law, and our luſts, to the fellowſhip of God's Son.—Ariſe, my ſoul, <hi>the Maſter is come, and calleth for thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The change of our ſtate is repreſented as Chriſt's SEEKING and FINDING us out <note n="a" place="bottom">Matth xviii. 11. 12. 13.</note>. With amazing love, care, and ſkill, he purſueth us by his word and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. By his ſervants, he ſends forth his word, that, in various forms and expreſſions ſuiting every caſe, it may run ſpeedily; and, through the Spirit, hit our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular condition, touch our conſcience, and draw our heart. Having thus apprehended us, he brings us to his preſence, inſtates us in his favour, and reſtores to us the felicity and uſefulneſs of which ſin had deprived us.—Lord, when I know not were to find myſelf, do thou ſeek and find me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is called a MARRIAGE, or ESPOUSALS <note n="b" place="bottom">Song iii. 11.</note>. In conſequence of our Redeemer's preparing himſelf for us, by undertaking our cauſe, aſſuming our nature, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing himſelf with wedding robes of finiſhed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fulfilled in our ſtead; in conſequence of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a place for us, by blood and interceſſion; and of his wooing us by the word of his goſpel, he, in the predeſtinated moment of power, and his time of love, breaks our natural union and affection to the broken law; to Satan and our corrupt inclinations; and by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enters and dwells in our heart; and enableth us to accept of him, as our only, our everlaſting huſband. As ſuch, he hath fellowſhip with us in bearing our guilt; and in our infirmities and afflictions; in our grace and exerciſe; and we with him in his righteouſneſs, ſtrength honour, and work. Mutually he and we dwell with, eſteem, love, deſire, delight in, rejoice over, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt our mind one to another.—O bleſſed marriage! the joy of Jeſus, and of my ſoul.</p>

It is by the amazing patience and labour of God, we are cut off from the ſtock of the fallen Adam; are cloſely united to, rooted and grounded in Chriſt;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0052801100:335"/>
made partakers of his death and reſurrection; and ſo revive, and bring forth fruit unto God.—Here being planted, O my ſoul, thou ſhalt caſt forth thy roots as Lebanon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is repreſented as a CONQUEST <note n="a" place="bottom">Pſal. xlv. 3. 4. 5.</note>. Finding us the ſubjects of the law, and of Satan, the world, and our luſts, filled with rage and enmity againſt him and his people, Jeſus Chriſt, with infinite power, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and patience, attacks our ſoul with the ſword of his Spirit,—his word; faſtens in us the arrows of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and heart-drawing influences; ſlays our enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by his powerful promiſes and bleeding love; conſtrains us to yield our ſouls, take his eaſy yoke upon us, and conſent to be his willing, affectionate, and obedient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.—So, Lord Jeſus, conquer multitudes; conquer me.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is repreſented as a LIBERATION <note n="b" place="bottom">Zech. ix. 11. 12.</note>. Finding us in a moſt wretched, ſhameful, and ſlaviſh captivity, to Satan and our ſinful corruption, and in the unclean, unwholeſome, unhappy, cold, dark, diſgraceful, and confining priſon of our natural ſtate; Jeſus powerfully overthroweth the dominion of our enſlavers in us; loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the chains of our guilt, by the application of his all pardoning blood; breaks the fetters of our luſt, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and enmity, by the power of his grace; and beſtows on us the moſt glorious freedom, honour, and reſt.—Out of priſon, I come to reign.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is repreſented as a DEATH <note n="c" place="bottom">Gal. ii. 19. 20.</note>. Herein we partake of the influence of Jeſus' death. Our old man receives his mortal wound, of which he afterward dieth daily. In it our hopes of happineſs by our own works, our relation and love to the law as a covenant, our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſtudy to ſerve it, our ſuperlative regard to ſinful and earthly things, painfully expire.—So may I die, that I may live unto God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is repreſented as a BURIAL <note n="d" place="bottom">Col. ii. 12.</note>. In it, we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the virtue of Jeſus' death and burial; and are conformed to him. We commence God's hidden ones, whoſe glory doth not appear; and are rendered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0052801100:336"/>
and diſagreeable to carnal and worldly men, Sweetly we reſt from ſin; and ſelf-righteouſneſs; from the overwhelming terrors of the law; of death and hell; and from every ſting of trouble and adverſity.—So let me be buried with Chriſt; ſo come, my ſoul, and <hi>ſee the place where the Lord lay.</hi>

                  <p n="9">9. It is called a RESURRECTION <note n="a" place="bottom">Ezek. xx1vii 1.—14.</note>. Being by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the moſt earthly, withered, dry, lifeleſs, and lothſome condition, Jeſus, by his Spirit of life, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth us; cauſeth us to paſs from death to life; brings us from our graves of condemnation and luſt; clothes us with the white robes of his righteouſneſs and grace; and qualifieth us to work and walk with God, angels, and good men.—So let a poor ſleeper in the duſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and ſing.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. It is called a CREATION <note n="b" place="bottom">Eph. iii. 10.</note>. Unaſſiſted by any creature, Jeſus, by his almighty power and word, forms the ever-abiding ſtructure of grace, the <hi>new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> out of nothing. His work he commenceth in the forming of ſpiritual light and knowledge. Daily he adds new ornaments thereto, till, againſt the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of eternal reſt, it be fully perfected.—So, Lord, <hi>create in me a clean heart,</hi> and <hi>renew a right ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me.</hi>

12. It is repreſented as a SECOND, a HEAVENLY BIRTH <note n="a" place="bottom">John iii. 3. 5.</note>. Of the incorruptible ſeed of his word and grace, Jeſus, our ſpiritual Father, begets us again to a lively hope. Curiouſly and wonderfully, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to his image! Without our preparation or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſtance, there is formed a marvellous contexture of grace, a <hi>new man.</hi> We are made partakers of a DIVine and heavenly nature. By his painful ſorrow and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, by miniſters painful labours, and with our own painful experience, we are born and brought into the <hi>new,</hi> the heavenly world, of a <hi>new-</hi>covenant ſtate, and become related to God, angels, and ſaints.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. It is called a CIRCUMCISION, <hi>not of the fleſh, but of the heart</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Col. ii. 11. Deut. xxx. 6.</note>. Therein God, by his word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſharply pricks and wounds our heart and conſcience; expoſeth to us our ſpiritual nakedneſs and guilt; cuts off the reigning power of indwelling corruption; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents our after pollution; manifeſts and confirms our intereſt in his covenant; and gives us a conſtant and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding mark of our relation to him. And without it, we are expoſed to endleſs deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. It is called BAPTISM <note n="c" place="bottom">Matth. iii. 11.</note>. Therein we are graciouſly received into covenant with God, and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to the privileges of his people. Therein, waſhed in Jeſus' blood, and purified by the influence of his Spirit, we ſolemnly receive God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, as our Parent, Saviour, Sanctifier, and <hi>all in all;</hi> and cheerfully dedicate ourſelves to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.—My ſoul, hath Jeſus baptized me with the holy Spirit, and with his fiery and ſin-purifying influence?</p>
                  <p n="15">15. It is called a TURNING or CONVERSION <note n="d" place="bottom">Jer. xxxi. 18.</note>. Therein we are DIVinely turned from the paths of hell to the ways of heaven; from darkneſs to light; from guilt to righteouſneſs; from ſin to holineſs; from ſlavery to freedom; from poverty to wealth; from rebellion and enmity, to favour, acceptance, and intimate friendſhip with God; from diſtance to nearneſs; from ſinful ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and weakneſs, to ſpiritual foundneſs and ſtrength. So turn me, Lord, and I ſhall be turned.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. It is called a TRANSLATION <hi>into the kingdom of</hi>

                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Col. i. 13.</note>. By his grace Jeſus lays hold upon us; bears us in the arms of his power and love; carries us into a new-covenant ſtate; in which we are only ſubject to him, and not to the broken law, raging de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or reigning luſts.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The work of grace in mens heart is called the KINGDOM OF GOD <note n="b" place="bottom">Luke xvii. 20.</note>. In the day of his power, Jeſus invades and enters our heart; by his word and Spirit, he overthrows the ſtrong holds of inherent corruption; overturns the reigning power of Satan and our luſts; conquers every faculty of our ſoul; fixeth his palace and throne, and writes his law in our inward parts; erects the judicature of a purged, enlightened, and tender conſcience: he entitleth us to all his fulneſs and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; enters us into league with his omnipotent perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, mighty angels, and uſeful creatures on earth. Storing our inward powers with his DIVine armour, he diſpoſeth and enableth us to wage war with ſin, Satan, and the world. Thrice bleſſed kingdom, conſiſting not in meat and drink; but in righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt!—Thrice happy and honoured is my ſoul, if this kingdom, that cannot be removed, be within me!</p>
                  <p n="18">18. The change of family herein is called ADOP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION <note n="c" place="bottom">Gal. iv. 5. 6.</note>. Finding us children of the devil, and heirs of wrath, God, in infinite mercy and kindneſs, puts us among his children of angels and ſaints; and giveth us an undoubted and everlaſting title to all the privileges of ſonſhip. His name he puts upon us; his Spirit in us; and his image on us. His angels he appoints to guard, and his miniſters to inſpect and inſtruct us. Our prayers he hears, our requeſts he grants, and allows us familiar boldneſs and intimacy with him. He teacheth, directs, feeds, clothes, arms, protects, comforts, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us. Irreverſibly he bequeaths to us the everlaſting, the <hi>pleaſant land, and goodly heritage of the hoſts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> the whole fulneſs of God. O aſtoniſhing! when guilt, pollution, and enmity, might have juſtly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his endleſs deteſtation, he ſaid to my ſoul, <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken and done evil things as thou couldſt; wilt thou not</hi>

                  <p n="19">19. Our new covenant ſtate is called a REST <note n="a" place="bottom">Matth. xi. 28.</note>.

There is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us. No evil can befal us. God and his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are in a covenant of peace with us.

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. Pardon of ſin, which is often put for the whole of our juſtification, is repreſented as God's <hi>being merciful to our unrighteouſneſs</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Heb. viii. 12.</note>. It is entirely of his free, rich, and ſovereign grace and mercy, that he doth not avenge, but forgive our unrighteouſneſs of heart or life. O grace, grace unto it!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is repreſented as a COVERING <hi>of ſin</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">Pſal. xxxii. 1.</note>. By the imputation of Jeſus' righteouſneſs for our robe, our guilt is ſo hid and covered, as no more to expoſe us to God's revenging wrath; nor can it juſtly annoy our conſcience with legal horror.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is called a REMISSION or FORGIVENESS <note n="d" place="bottom">Acts v. 31.</note>. Therein God moſt fully acquits us of the charge of our crimes; ſecures us againſt the avenging and wrathful

puniſhment thereof; and removes every legal bar, that obſtructs our hope, our happineſs, or comfort.</p>

                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Iſ. xliii. 25.</note>. Having pardoned it, Gôd no more continues to charge or puniſh it upon us; but allows us as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent friendſhip, familiarity, and fulneſs of bleſſings, as if we never had ſinned. How often, my ſoul, hath he taken me into his boſom, as if I had been an innocent angel!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is repreſented as his BLOTTING OUT of ſin <note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. li. 1. 9.</note>. Upon the imputation of Jeſus' blood to our perſon and conſcience, our ſinful debts, and the demands of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for them, are ſo dropt from the book of God's judicial remembrance, that neither he, nor the broken law, nor our conſcience, have the leaſt remaining ground to charge them upon us, in order to require ſatisfaction for them.</p>

Our ſins are buried the deeps of JEHOVAH'S love and Jeſus' blood; nor ought fears of DIVine curſes or condemnation in the leaſt to diſmay us.

Holy deſire, prayer, and praiſe, are our ſpiritual breath. Obedience to Jeſus' law, is our motion and work.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is repreſented as a CALLING; an OCCUPATION; VOCATION; or BUSINESS <note n="b" place="bottom">John vi. 26. Phil. ii. 13.</note>. To proceed therein, we muſt know the myſteries of the goſpel, concerning Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, in his perſon, his offices, relations, benefits, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; and concerning ourſelves, in our ſtate, our qualities, and duties. We muſt have a ſtock of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteouſneſs, implanted grace, and exceeding great and precious promiſes. We muſt underſtand the nature and worth of ſpiritual and heavenly things. We muſt daily attend to the exerciſe of holineſs, as our great, our important work. We muſt carefully abide at home, keeping our heart, watching over, and ordering our converſation. Frequently, by ſelf-examination, we muſt diſtinctly ſtate our buſineſs, our accounts; and clear them by application of Jeſus' blood. Our ſtock being his, his glory is to be intended in every thing we do. Always ought we to thrive in grace, and know that we do ſo. No labour or pains are to be ſpared, that we may perfect holineſs in the fear of God. How ſignally do quick returns of prayer, and eminent communications of grace, increaſe our ſtock, and animate our diligence! And how rich ſhall this bleſſed occupation render us, in our laſt end! Godlineſs with contentment is great gain, <hi>having the promiſes of this life, and of that which is to come.</hi> Apply to it, my ſoul, in every branch thereof; ſo number thy days that thou mayeſt apply thy heart unto wiſdom, and learn God's truth; plough up the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ground of thy heart, accepting his rod and word for thy conviction and contrition. Deny thyſelf; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, ſhake off thy drouſineſs and ſloth; beware of prodigal waſting of JEHOVAH'S bounty; whatſoever things are needful, whatſoever things are lovely, and of

                  <p n="4">4. It is repreſented as a WALK or JOURNEY <note n="a" place="bottom">Col. ii. 6. Rom. viii. 14.</note>. With hope and earneſt deſire to obtain the better country, we therein chooſe Jeſus and his law for our way, and with pleaſure proceed from one degree of grace, or act of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, to another, till at length we appear before God in the heavenly Zion.

It is a <hi>walking humbly and mournfully</hi> with him, in the faith of his preſence with us, as our God, our Father, our Friend, and our Guide; daily loathing, and mourning over our corruptions and offences done to him. It is a <hi>walking before</hi> him; with reverence of, and as in his immediate prefence, and in hope of direction and reward from him. It is <hi>a walking in his name,</hi> as his ſervants, influenced by his power and promiſe, directed by his law, and intended to his honour. It is an <hi>upright walk,</hi> our purpoſe and practice uniformly concurring to advance the glory of God.

It is a <hi>walking with the wiſe;</hi> making thoſe who are taught of God our patterns and companions in every good word and work.</p>

In the word of God, is the way, the troubles attending, the method of courſe, the pattern, and prize, <hi>ſet before us.</hi> The race plot, is this preſent world; the prize, the heavenly glory; the path, Jeſus and his law.

                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Song viii. 5.</note>. Finding no reſt, eaſe, or ſatisfaction, in this deſart world, or in the barren be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildering ſtate of ſin, or condition of eſtrangement from God, we muſt turn away our deſire, our delight, and expectation therefrom; and in a ſtate of union to, exerciſe of intimacy with, and dependence on Jeſus' perſon, righteouſneſs, and ſtrength, walk-in him, and his word, as our way; and with aſſiduous labour, vigour, and prudence, ſurmount every towering impediment of ignorance, unbelief, of temptation, perſecution, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of terror and guilt; following on to know the Lord, till we are ſet down on his right hand.</p>

                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Gal. v. 17. Eph. vi. 10.—19. 2 Tim. iv. 8.</note>. In it our new man of inward grace, like a ſtrong and active ſpirit, wills, chooſeth, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows after, the things which tend to the deſtruction of ſin. Therein is our whole man, ſoul, body, and ſpirit, with ſkill, courage, patience, and preſeverance, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, fight againſt, and by all poſſible means, ſeek the deſtruction of indwelling luſt; to fight againſt Satan, reſiſting and labouring to overcome his temptations; to fight againſt the world, trampling on its alluring entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, deſpiſing its frowns, oppoſing its wicked errors, and abominable practices; and againſt multitudes of afflictions, patiently enduring them. It it a <hi>good fight.</hi> It is for the <hi>good</hi> cauſe of God and truth; under a <hi>good</hi> captain, Jeſus Chriſt; it is to be performed in a <hi>good</hi> method, according to the law of God, with the good armour of God, and in the good and well-grounded hope of a good victory and ſpoil, an ineſtimable crown of glory, life, and righteouſneſs. It is a <hi>fight of faith,</hi> fought to maintain the doctrine of <hi>faith once delivered to the ſaints;</hi> and by the grace of faith, is ſtanding, and victory therein ſignally obtained.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is repreſented as a KEEPER and EXALTER of a nation <note n="c" place="bottom">Prov. xiii. 6. and xiv. 34.</note>. What a bleſſed means of preſerving it from

                  <p n="9">9. It is compared to the GROWTH of perſons, herbs, and trees <note n="a" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 15. Hoſ. xiv. 5. 7.</note>. Notwithſtanding our frequent ſickneſs, and ſad blaſts of temptation, and froſt-like prevalency of indwelling luſts, the daily application of Jeſus, as our bread of life, and of the watering and warming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of his Spirit and love, make holineſs in heart and life pleaſantly and inſenſibly to revive and increaſe, till we be ripe for everlaſting glory, having attained the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. True godlineſs is called the FEAR <hi>of the Lord</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. cxi. 10.</note>. With a reverential fear of, and love to him, are all its exerciſes and bleſſings attended. And truly this is the <hi>beginning of wiſdom;</hi> a beginning to chooſe the better part, never to be taken away.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. It is called WISDOM <note n="c" place="bottom">Prov. ii. 2.</note>. Hereby we chooſe the beſt friend, companion, huſband, and portion; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the things that differ; follow after righteouſneſs, peace, charity; and run in the way of God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And by improving Jeſus Chriſt, as our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and ſtrength, take a proper method to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form goſpel holineſs, and obtain the DIVine acceptance thereof.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The path of the juſt is repreſented as SHINING LIGHT, <hi>ſhining more and more unto the perfect day</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="bottom">Prov. iv. 18.</note>. From ſmall beginnings, their knowledge, their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and comfort gradually, myſteriouſly, and pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe, till they be ſwallowed up in the noon-tide brightneſs of eternal glory.

Surely this is a <hi>way above,</hi> wherein heavenly things are chiefly attended. A <hi>way of life,</hi> marking life ſpiritual, and preparing for life eternal.</p>

13. Holy exerciſes reſemble LILIFS <note n="a" place="bottom">Song vii. 2.</note>. Numbers of them ſpring from one root or principle of faith. How pure! comely! high! and heaven bending! the better they are, the more humility and ſelf denial are mixed with them.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Holy exerciſes, real religion, and true wiſdom, are a TREE OF LIFE <note n="b" place="bottom">Prov. iii. 18. and iv. 13.</note>.

                  <p n="15">15. Holy exerciſes are called the GREEN FRUITS <hi>of the valley;</hi> and the BUDS or FRUITS of the ſaints, theſe trees of righteouſneſs <note n="c" place="bottom">Song vi. 11.</note>. In conſequence of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation into Chriſt, and union with him, they gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, one after another, appear in our life, and are but imperfect, while we continue on earth.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Holineſs of life is called a SOWING <hi>in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> a SOWING <hi>in tears,</hi> and to <hi>the Spirit</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="bottom">Prov. xi. 18.</note>. In practiſing it, we, in the ſolid hope of eternal glory, carefully work righteouſneſs;—amidſt grief and ſorrow, we follow the dictates and operation of the Holy Ghoſt; and act as influenced by, and to the advantage of our new nature. And O what mercy, joy, and immortal happineſs, we ſhall reap in the final, the eternal har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt!</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The fear of the Lord is a FOUNTAIN <hi>of life</hi> 
                     <note n="e" place="bottom">Prov. xiv. 26.</note>. How refreſhing its influence! What endleſs glory! In what immortal life will it break forth at laſt! From thee, O <hi>fountain of living waters,</hi> is my life, my fruit found.</p>

                  <p n="19">19. Experimental knowledge of real religion is like HONEY and the HONEY COMB <note n="g" place="bottom">Prov. iii. 13.—16.</note>. How ſweet and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing!

                  <p n="1">1. THE indwelling ſin of our nature is compared to a KING and MASTER <note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. v. 21.</note>. With great force and authority, it ruleth in, and over the wicked. Their heart is its palace and throne; devils, wicked men, and worldly things, are its armies and guard; every method of oppoſition to God is its law. By an amazing, powerful, and conſtant urgency, it mightily compels its unregenerate ſubjects to do whatſoever it liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, however vile or ſlaviſh; nor can any created pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſubdue and conquer it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is compared to a WARRIOUR <note n="b" place="bottom">Rom. vii. 23.</note>. Armed with the curſe of the broken law, delivering us up to ſpiritual death, it, with the utmoſt ſubtlety, averſation, oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, enmity, and violent rage, fights againſt God, his Son, his Spirit, his word, and grace; and, with reſtleſs violence and crafty ſtratagems, alway exerts its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to ſubdue our whole man into an entire ſlavery to itſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is compared to a MAN <note n="c" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 22.</note>. It ſpreads through every part of our ſoul and body; fills our heart with all <hi>unrighteouſneſs, unbelief, pride, debate, deceit, malignity,</hi> high, vain, and vile imaginations and affections. In our mind, it is ignorance, vanity, pride, error, and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs; in our conſcience, it is ſearedneſs, partiality, or rage; in our will, weakneſs, averſion, and enmity to every thing good; in our affections, it is earthlineſs, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, diſorder. It fills our mouth with curſing and bitterneſs; renders our ears open to error and filthineſs; our eyes apt to behold vanity, <hi>lifted up,</hi> and <hi>full of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;</hi> our hands apt to perpetrate evil; and our <hi>feet ſwift to ſhed blood.</hi> It is an <hi>old man.</hi> It is in us from our conception; and is alway pre-exiſtent to our grace.
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0052801100:364"/>
And however crafty, peeviſh, and proud it be; yet in the ſaints, it is in a weakened and languiſhing condition.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Indwelling luſts may be called our MOTHER's CHILDREN <note n="a" place="bottom">Song i. 6.</note>. By our mother we are conceived and born in them. They have no origin or allowance from God our heavenly Father. Alas! how they grow up with us from our birth! What a curſed intimacy is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and our ſoul! Alas! how they render us the <hi>keepers of the vineyards!</hi> how they entangle or force us into the moſt baſe and ſervile courſes, to the neglect of our own heart, practice, office, or intereſt!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is repreſented as a WITNESS or WRITTEN TE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIMONY <note n="b" place="bottom">Jer. xiv. 7. and xvii. 1.</note>. How deeply it is engraven on our heart! How irrefragably its reign there, and our habitual vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary commiſſion of actual tranſgreſſions, teſtify be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and our awakened conſcience, that we are unregenerate enemies to our Maker! children of Satan! incapable to recover ourſelves! unripe for heaven! rich deſervants, and infeoffed heirs of endleſs miſery!—and teſtify, that God is righteous in correcting and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us!</p>

It is repreſented as an uncommon DECEIVER <hi>(d).</hi> It deceiveth and renders deceitful all mankind; renders our heart deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked; renders it more deceiving to us, than Satan himſelf. It promiſeth us pleaſure and profit in offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God; and maketh us imagine that we enjoy them, while we are conſumed by it; and that we procure wealth, while we loſe our ſoul, and every thing good or uſeful, and pierce ourſelves through with many ſorrows.

How craftily it ſteals away our time, our opportuities, our concern for eternal happineſs! How inſenſibly, or violently, it robs us of our peace, honour, riches, and reſt! Alas! how it carries us out of God's way! wounds our ſoul! binds us hand and foot! and renders us incapable to purſue after it, raiſe an outery againſt it or cry to God, for juſt vengeance on it!

How nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, the falſe names of virtue, which it aſſumes! and in the night of ignorance, of deluſion, temptation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, how effectually it attempts, and ſucceeds in, its unhallowed and ſhameful work!</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is compared to a WHORE <note n="b" place="bottom">James i. 13. 14.</note>. Ah! how cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly it enticeth and leads us from God, to comply with our luſts! how it conceiveth and brings forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual crimes! and ſo conceiveth and brings forth our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced ruin. Curſed be ſhe, in her baſket, and in her ſtore, and in the fruit of her womb. Bleſſed be he, who taketh her little ones, her firſt motions, and daſheth them to pieces. May iniquity, in every form, ſtop her mouth; hide herſelf as aſhamed: may her partiſans ſtop their mouth; and with grief and bluſhing confeſs themſelves guilty before God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Sin is compared to an EVIL-DOIR, <hi>nailed to, and crucified on a croſs</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 6.</note>. In the ſaints, not only God, but the man himſelf, condemn it; and take vengeance upon it for its murderous, its thieviſh crimes: and,

               <p n="7">7. It is compared to a FLOOD <note n="a" place="bottom">Pſal. xc. 5.</note>. Gradually, ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, violently, irreſiſtibly, and often to their great terror, it carries men into the ocean of ETERNITY. Ah! how many have their ſandy foundation, their ill-founded hopes of everlaſting happineſs, overturned by it, and are carried into the depths of hell! Bleſſed Jeſus, thou art my ſure hope; no floods of death, no gates of hell, can prevail againſt thee; thou haſt ſwallowed up death in victory.</p>

Thereby the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the ſaints reſt in hope, while their ſouls are occupied in the high praiſes of our God; the bodies of the wicked reſt from labour in the priſon of the grave, while their ſouls are tormented in hell.

What amazing diſcoveries of God's perfections pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and word; and of the diſpoſitions, ſtates, and lives, of angels and men, ſhall be then made! What important and extenſive work ſhall be thereon perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! The dead ſhall be raiſed, the living changed, the world judged; the wicked ſhall depart into everlaſting puniſhment, and the righteous into life eternal; <hi>the earth, and the works therein, ſhall be burnt up!—</hi>O <hi>great day,</hi> honoured with the appearance of the great God! O great centre of eternity! great joy of ſaints! great terror of reprobates! O dark, gloomy, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible day to the wicked!

What ſcreams to the hills and mountains ſhall proceed from their now pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erleſs lips! for the great day of his wrath is come; and who ſhall be able to ſtand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is compared to a REAPING TIME; a HARVEST-DAY <note n="b" place="bottom">Matth. xiii. 39.</note>. What great and important buſineſs ſhall be done thereon! How univerſally ſhall all nations be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and ſettled on a new bottom! How completely ſhall the wicked be ſeparated from the righteous and by multitudes caſt into hell-fire, to reap the fruit of their wickedneſs! With what enrapturing pleaſure and gladneſs ſhall the redeemed reap the fruit of JEHOVAH's promiſes, and receive the all-gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of every good work! How triumphantly ſhall they enter into God's barn of everlaſting glory and reſt! It is thine, O Jeſus, and thine, O ſaint, to go forth weeping, bearing precious ſeed, and to return re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, bring your ſheaves with you. Go, my ſoul, into the houſe of mourning, rather than the houſe of mirth. They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy.</p>

Pompouſly then ſhall Jeſus, our appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Judge, ſit down on his awful bench, call, and in proper order ſiſt before him all nations, and exhibit the moſt exact repreſentation of their caſe. The ſaints being acquitted, ſhall be his aſſeſſors in judging others; the wicked ſhall be arraigned, and their guilt fully evinced. Then every thought, word, and deed of the children of men, muſt be accounted for; and upon clear manifeſtation of their ſtate and conduct, ſhall juſt ſentence and immediate execution proceed.—Great Judge, I kiſs my lips, that I can give a right anſwer; <hi>It was exacted, and thou anſwereſt it: all my faults were thine.</hi>

After ſpiritual betrothing in the council of peace, and in effectual calling; after extenſive preparation, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant longing for the event, ſhall Jeſus, with all his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed, in the higheſt raptures of joy and love, in all the pomp of glorious apparel, before angels and men, be ſolemnly declared <hi>eſpouſed one to another;</hi> and in conſequence thereof, for ever obtain the moſt ſplendid feaſt, on <hi>all the fulneſs of God,</hi> on the <hi>new wine</hi> of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love, and the mutual enjoyment of one another.—Write on thy heart, my ſoul, <hi>Bleſſed are they which are called to the marriage ſupper of the Lamb.</hi> O when ſhall the union of mingled elements be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that my relation to Jeſus may be all in all!</p>

Here is Jeſus, the Roſe of Sharon, and Lily of the valley, the Plant of renown, the unforbidden <hi>tree of knowledge,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded <hi>tree of life.</hi> Here runs the bleſſed <hi>river of life,</hi> that for ever refreſheth and raviſheth angels and men. Here flouriſh all the promiſes, and all the ranſomed plants of the Lord. Here no ſerpents lurk; there is no freedom of will to evil. And we are without ſpot and blemiſh, faultleſs before the preſence of God, with exceeding joy.<hi>—This is my reſt,</hi> here will I ſtay, for I have deſired it.</p>

6. It is repreſented as a HOUSE <hi>eternal; not made with bands;</hi> and a GARNER <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 1.</note>. Being DIVinely erected, framed, furniſhed, and prepared, it endureth for ever, and comprehends the moſt abundant ſafety, ſecrecy, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and happineſs. Thither wilt thou, O Jeſus, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port all thy good <hi>wheat,</hi> thy ranſomed friends, and preſerve them uncorrupted, raviſhed, and comely.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is called a TREASURE <note n="b" place="bottom">Matth. vi. 20.</note>. How inconceivably rich and valuable! in time how unknown! But how comprehenſive! how ſupporting! emboldening! and heart-attracting, to him who hath it! My ſoul, cover earneſtly this beſt thing; dig for it more than for hid treaſures: and where my treaſure is, ſecured by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, by the care of JEHOVAH, there let my heart be.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is repreſented as PEACE and REST <note n="c" place="bottom">Iſ. lvii. 2. Heb. iv. 9.</note>. O the profound and unceaſing quiet thereof! Peace, harmony, and love, reign in every breaſt. Here the covenant of peace, and its reſtful bleſſings, are enjoyed in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfection. Toilſome labour is no more; but our endleſs employ of contemplation, love, wonder, and praiſe, is unmixed pleaſure. Here want is neither felt nor feared; no enemy is to contend with, or danger to come near us. But the work of Jeſus' righteouſneſs is peace, and the effect of it. <hi>quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.</hi> His people ſhall dwell in a <hi>peaceable babitation, and in quiet reſting-places.</hi> Haſten, my ſoul, to this reſt, that remaineth for the people of God; for the Lord ſhall deal bountifully with thee.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The heavenly felicity is called GLORY; and <hi>an</hi> EXCEEDING WEIGHT <hi>of glory</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="bottom">2 Cor. iv. 17.</note>. O its brightneſs and dazzling excellency! What glory is within! what glory on! and what glory all around us! What views of God in his brightneſs! of Jeſus in the glory that the Father hath given him! How ſhall we be wrapt up, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into glory, when our vile-body is made <hi>like to his glorious body;</hi> when the Lord is our <hi>everlaſting light;</hi> and our God our glory!—Stop, my ſoul; floods of glory check my thought; bright rays of holineſs, of wiſdom, of juſtice and mercy, beat ſweet confuſion on
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0052801100:421"/>
my view!—O how contrary this to, and far exceeding our deſerts! how far it exceeds our preſent hopes and conceptions! Nor, without tranſcending addition to our ſtrength, could we ſubſiſt under its raviſhing pleaſure and brightneſs!—My God, is it THIS which my afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions work for me? ſend me then, as many, and as heavy ones, as thou wilt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It is called the JOY <hi>of the Lord</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Matth. xxv. 21.</note>. There God is the matter of our joy; and our gladneſs approacheth as near as poſſible to his; and eſpecially to that of Chriſt as Mediator. With what tranſporting pleaſure, ſhall we think of the hell which we have eſcaped! of the troubles and temptations which we have overcome! of the holineſs and everlaſting felicity which we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained! With what pleaſure ſhall we behold our bleſſed companions, and hear the unceaſing hallelujahs! With what joy ſhall we recount the deeds, and behold the glory of our DAY'S-MAN, that MIRACLE of wonders! that COMPEND of all things! that BEAUTY, HONOUR, and TRIUMPH! nay, ECLIPSER of the glory of creation! that MARROW of our love! LIFE of our joys! FOUNTAIN of our comfort! and CENTRE of our hearts! that RA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VISHMENT of angels and men! that DELIGHT of JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH! and BRIGHTNESS <hi>of</hi> the Father's <hi>glory!</hi> that everlaſting EXCELLENCY and JOY of all generations. O could my ſoul leap out, and drop her duller clay! ſcarce ſhould a harp above aim at a ſweeter or a higher ſong.—Hoſanna to the Son of David; Hoſanna in the higheſt.</p>

               <p n="1">1. HELL is called a LAKE <hi>that</hi> BURNS <hi>with fire and brimſtone</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Rev. xx. 10.</note>. Here men, like the ancient So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites, are conſtituted monuments of DIVine vengeance. Here every power of their ſoul, every member and ſenſe of their body, is tormented in the flames! Here, ye children of diſobedience, ſhall your luſts for ever rage in deſire, and find nothing to ſatisfy them! no not a dry morſel; no not a drop of water to cool the tip of your tongue. When the arrows of the Almighty ſtick faſt in you; when the laſhes of conſcience torment you; when devils inſult, and conſcience upbraids you, for throwing away your heavenly birthright, your God, and your glory; for incurring the vengeance of eternal fire, for an empty ſip of polluted joy; with what anguiſh ſhall you bewail the infinite, the irrecoverable loſs! with what horror ſhall you behold the frowns! with what envy, hatred, and malice, ſhall you tremble under the hand of an angry God!</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is compared to TOPHET <note n="b" place="bottom">Iſ. xxx. 33. Matth. v. 22. Cr.</note>, a valley near Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, where the Jews burnt their children to Molech, and the angel ſlew 185,000 Aſſyrians in one night. How near to the heavenly Jeruſalem is the ſtate of the damned! with what infuriated rage, madneſs, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, they behold the happineſs which they once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed! How terrible their torment! how horrid their outcries!—Alas! who ſhall live when the Lord doth this!</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is compared to a BURNING FIERY FURNACE, that cannot be quenched <note n="c" place="bottom">Matth. xiii. 42.</note>. How terrible its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances! How exquiſite and univerſal its torments! how painful and penetrating! And O ſhocking thought,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0052801100:423"/>
FOR EVER! Ye ſinners in Zion be afraid; let fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſurpriſe the hypocrites. Who among you <hi>ſhall dwell with devouring fire!</hi> who ſhall <hi>dwell with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnings!</hi> While there is hope, flee, flee from the wrath to come. <hi>New is the accepted time; now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſends him to bleſs you, in turning you from your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. But if he is rejected, how ſhall every offer of him, like oil, enrage the flames upon you, and, like ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, for ever inwardly ſting you!</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is compared to a PRISON <note n="a" place="bottom">1 Pet. iii. 19.</note>. Here tranſgreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors are for ever ſhut up to the fury of Almighty God; are expoſed to the moſt ſhocking diſgrace and contempt; ſink under guilt and condemnation; have no reſt, day nor night, but are tormented with the devil and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. You minions of gaiety, conſider the iſſue of your madneſs; FOR EVER, if mercy prevent not, God's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed wrath ſhall be your drink, your food; the howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the damned your muſic; enraged fiends your inſeparable companions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is called a BOTTOMLESS PIT <note n="b" place="bottom">Rev. ix. 11.</note>. How incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveably dreadful, and durable, is the miſery thereof! Amidſt what inexpreſſible conſternation and deſpair, do its inhabitants for ever ſink into deeper ſcenes of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and miſery.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is repreſented as UTTER DARKNESS; and BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS <note n="c" place="bottom">Matth. viii. 12.</note>. In it there is no glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of patience, mercy, or hope; but endleſs wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, perplexity, anguiſh, torment, and terror.—Kiſs now, my ſoul, the Son of God, leſt he be angry, and I periſh from the way.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is compared to a STORM <note n="d" place="bottom">Pſal. xi. 6.</note>. O the violence, irreſiſtibleneſs, and unſupportableneſs of DIVine wrath, raining upon them <hi>ſnares, fire, brimſtone, and an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tempeſt!</hi> Ah! how their ſouls tremble at the thunder-claps of vengeance! and are toſſed by the fury of Almighty God!</p>
               <p n="8">8. Infernal torments are compared to SALT <note n="e" place="bottom">Mark ix. 49.</note>. Ah! how painful, penetrating, and permament! How power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

Being ſhed abroad in my heart, let it be a killing ſalt to every luſt; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire to every corruption.
