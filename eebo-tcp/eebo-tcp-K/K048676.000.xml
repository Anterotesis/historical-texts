            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The DESIGN.</head>
            <p>THERE are certain powers in human nature which ſeem to hold a middle place between the organs of bodily ſenſe and the faculties of moral perception: They have been call'd by a very general name, THE POWERS OF IMAGINATION. Like the external ſenſes, they relate to matter and motion; and at the ſame time, give the mind ideas analogous to thoſe of moral approbation and diſlike. As they are the inlets of ſome of the moſt exquiſite pleaſures we are acquainted with, men of warm and ſenſible tempers have ſought means to recall the delightful perceptions they afford, independent of the objects which originally produc'd them. This gave riſe to the imitative or deſigning arts; ſome of which, as painting and ſculpture, directly copy the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal appearances which were admir'd in nature; others, as muſic and poetry, bring them back to remembrance by ſigns univerſally eſtabliſh'd and underſtood.</p>
            <p>But theſe arts, as they grew more correct and deliberate, were naturally led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers; eſpecially poetry, which making uſe of language as the inſtrument by which it imitates, is conſequently become an unlimited repreſentative of every ſpecies and mode of being. Yet as their primary intention was only to expreſs the objects of imagination, and as they ſtill abound chiefly in ideas of that claſs, they of courſe retain their original character, and all the different pleaſures they excite, are term'd, in general, PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of the following poem is to give a view of <hi>theſe,</hi> in the largeſt acceptation of the term; <hi>ſo that whatever our imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature, and all the various entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we meet with either in poetry, painting, muſic, or any of the elegant arts, might be deducible from one or other of thoſe principles in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the human mind, which are here eſtabliſh'd and explain'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0886400900:4"/>
In executing this general plan it was neceſſary firſt of all to diſtinguiſh the imagination from our other faculties, and then to characterize thoſe original forms or properties of being about which it is converſant, and which are by nature adapted to it, as light is to the eyes, or truth to the underſtanding. Theſe properties Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> had reduc'd to the three general claſſes of greatneſs, novelty, and beauty; and into theſe we may analyſe every object, however complex, which, properly ſpeaking, is delightful to the imagination. But ſuch an object may alſo include many other ſources of pleaſure, and its beauty, or novelty, or grandeur, will make a ſtronger impreſſion by reaſon of this concurrence. Beſides this, the imitative arts, eſpecially poetry, owe much of their effect to a <hi>ſimilar</hi> exhibition of properties quite <hi>foreign</hi> to the imagination; inſomuch that in every line of the moſt applauded poems, we meet with either ideas drawn from the external ſenſes, or truths diſcover'd to the underſtanding, or illuſtrations of contrivance and final cauſes, or above all the reſt, with circumſtances proper to awaken and ingage the paſſions. It was therefore neceſſary to enumerate and exemplify theſe different ſpecies of pleaſure; eſpecially that from the paſſions, which as it is ſupreme in the nobleſt works of human genius, ſo being in ſome particulars not a little ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, gave an opportunity to inliven the didactic turn of the poem, by introducing a piece of machinery to account for the appearance.</p>
            <p>After theſe parts of the ſubject which hold chiefly of admiration, or naturally warm and intereſt the mind, a pleaſure of a very different nature, that which ariſes from ridicule, came next to be conſider'd. As this is the foundation of the comic manner in all the arts, and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers, it was thought proper to give it a particular illuſtration, and to diſtinguiſh the general ſources from which the ridicule of characters is deriv'd. Here too a change of ſtile became neceſſary; ſuch a one as might yet be conſiſtent, if poſſible, with the general taſte of compoſition in the ſerious parts of the ſubject: nor is it an eaſy taſk to give any tolerable force to images of this kind, without running either into the gigantic expreſſions of the mock-heroic, or the familiar and pointed raillery of profeſs'd ſatire; neither of which would have been proper here.</p>
            <p>The materials of all imitation being thus laid open, nothing now remain'd but to illuſtrate ſome particular pleaſures which ariſe either from the relations of different objects one to another, or from the nature of imitation itſelf. Of the firſt kind is that various and complicated reſemblance exiſting between ſeveral parts of the material and immaterial
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0886400900:5"/>
worlds, which is the foundation of metaphor and wit. As it ſeems in a great meaſure to depend on the early aſſociations of our ideas, and as this habit of aſſociating is the ſource of many pleaſures and pains in life, and on that account bears a great ſhare in the influence of poetry and the other arts, it is therefore mention'd here and its effects deſcrib'd. Then follows a general account of the production of theſe elegant arts, and the ſecondary pleaſure, as it is call'd, ariſing from the reſemblance of their imitations to the original appearances of nature. After which, the deſign is clos'd with ſome reflections on the general conduct of the powers of imagination, and on their natural and moral uſefulneſs in life.</p>
            <p>Concerning the manner or turn of compoſition which prevails in this piece, little can be ſaid with propriety by the author. He had two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels; that antient and ſimple one of the firſt <hi>Graecian</hi> poets, as it is refin'd by <hi>Virgil</hi> in the <hi>Georgics,</hi> and the familiar epiſtolary way of <hi>Horace.</hi> This latter has ſeveral advantages. It admits of a greater variety of ſtile; it more readily ingages the generality of readers, as partaking more of the air of converſation; and eſpecially with the aſſiſtance of rhyme, leads to a cloſer and more conciſe expreſſion. Add to this the example of the moſt perfect of modern poets, who has ſo happily applied this manner to the nobleſt parts of philoſophy, that the public taſte is in a great meaſure form'd to it alone. Yet, after all, the ſubject before us tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt conſtantly to admiration and enthuſiaſm, ſeem'd rather to demand a more open, pathetic and figur'd ſtile. This too appear'd more natural, as the author's aim was not ſo much to give formal precepts, or enter into the way of direct argumentation, as by exhibiting the moſt ingaging proſpects of nature, to enlarge and harmonize the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by that means inſenſibly diſpoſe the minds of men to the ſame dignity of taſte in religion, morals, and civil life. 'Tis on this account that he is ſo careful to point out the benevolent intention of the author of nature in every principle of the human conſtitution here inſiſted on; and alſo to unite the moral excellencies of life in the ſame point of view with the meer external objects of good taſte; thus recommending them in common to our natural propenſtiy for admiring what is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and lovely. The ſame views have alſo led him to introduce ſome ſentiments which may perhaps be look'd upon as not quite direct to the ſubject; but ſince they bear an obvious relation to it, the authority of <hi>Virgil,</hi> the faultleſs model of didactic poetry, will beſt ſupport him in this particular. For the ſentiments themſelves he makes no apology.</p>

                        </q>It is here ſaid, that in conſequence of the love of novelty, objects which at firſt were highly delightful to the mind, loſe that effect by repeated attention to them. But the inſtance of <hi>habit</hi> is oppos'd to this obſervation; for <hi>there,</hi> objects at firſt diſtaſteful are in time render'd intirely agreeable by repeated attention.</p>
                     <p>The difficulty in this caſe will be remov'd, if we conſider, that when objects at firſt agreeable, loſe that influence by frequently recurring, the mind is wholly <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> and the perception <hi>involuntary</hi>; but habit, on the other hand. generally ſuppoſes <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>activity</hi> accompanying it: ſo that the pleaſure ariſes here not from the object, but from the mind's <hi>conſcious</hi> determination of its own activity; and conſequently increaſes in proportion to the frequency of that determination.</p>
                     <p>It will ſtill be urged perhaps, that a familiarity with diſagreeable objects ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them at length acceptable, even when there is no room for the mind to <hi>reſolve</hi> or <hi>act</hi> at all. In this caſe, the appearance muſt be accounted for, one of theſe ways.</p>
                     <p>The pleaſure from habit may be meerly negative. The object at firſt gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs: this uneaſineſt gradually wears off as the object grows familiar; and the mind finding it at laſt intirely removed, reckons its ſituation really pleaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, compar'd with what it had experienced before.</p>
                     <p>The diſlike conceiv'd of the object at firſt, might be owing to prejudice or want of attention. Conſequently the mind being neceſſitated to review it often, may at length perceive its own miſtake, and be reconcil'd to what it had look'd on with averſion. In which caſe, a ſort of inſtinctive juſtice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury, by running toward th e other extreme of fondneſs and attachment.</p>
                     <p>Or laſtly, tho' the object itſelf ſhould always continue diſagreeable, yet cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of pleaſure or good fortune may occur along with it. Thus an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation may ariſe in the mind, and the object never be remember'd without thoſe pleaſing circumſtances attending it; by which means the diſagreeable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion it at firſt occaſion'd will in time be quite obliterated.</p>

                     <p>This excellent obſervation has been illuſtrated and extended by the noble reſtorer of ancient philoſophy; <hi>ſee the Characteriſticks,</hi> vol. 2. p. 399. &amp; 422. &amp; vol. 3. p. 181.

As to the connection between <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> there are two opinions concerning it. Some philoſophers aſſert an independent and invariable law in nature, in conſequence of which <hi>all rational beings muſt alike perceive beauty in ſome certain proportions, and deformity in the contrary.</hi> And this neceſſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed the ſame with that which commands the aſſent or diſſent of the underſtanding, it follows of courſe that <hi>beauty</hi> is founded on the univerſal and unchangeable law of <hi>truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But others there are who believe <hi>beauty</hi> to be meerly a relative and arbitrary thing; that indeed it was a benevolent deſign in nature to annex ſo delightful a ſenſation to thoſe objects which are <hi>beſt and moſt perfect in themſelves,</hi> that ſo we might be ingaged to the choice of them at once and without ſtaying to infer their <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> from their ſtructure and effects; but that it is not impoſſible, in a phyſical ſenſe, that two beings, of equal capacities for <hi>truth,</hi> ſhould perceive, one of them <hi>beauty,</hi> and the other <hi>deformity,</hi> in the ſame relations. And upon this ſuppoſition, by that <hi>truth</hi> which is always connected with <hi>beauty,</hi> nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to thoſe proportions upon which, after careful examination, the beauty of that ſpecies is found to depend. <hi>Polycletus</hi> for inſtance, the famous ſculptor of <hi>Sicyon,</hi> from an accurate menſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſeveral parts of the moſt perfect human bodies, deduced a canon or ſyſtem of proportions, which was the rule of all ſucceeding artiſts. Suppoſe a ſtatue modell'd according to this canon. A man of meer natural taſte, upon looking at it, without entering into its proportions, confeſſes and admires its <hi>beauty</hi>; whereas a profeſſor of the art applies his meaſures to the head, the neck, or the hand, and, without attending to its beauty, pronounces the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip to be <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>true.</hi>

Enumeration of accidental pleaſures, which increaſe the effect of objects delightful to the imagination. The pleaſures of ſenſe; <hi>v.</hi> 73. Particular circumſtances of the mind; <hi>v.</hi> 84. Diſcovery of truth; <hi>v.</hi> 97. Perception of contrivance and deſign; <hi>v.</hi> 121. Emotions of the paſſions; <hi>v.</hi> 136. All the natural paſſions partake of a pleaſing ſenſation, with the final cauſe of this conſtitution illuſtrated by an allegorical viſion, and exemplified in ſorrow, pity, terror and indignation; from <hi>v.</hi> 155 to the end.</p>

They at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted both the epic ode and ſatire, and abounded in a wild and fantaſtic vein of fable, partly allegorical, and partly founded on traditionary legends of the <hi>Saracen</hi> wars.

                           <hi>The being who preſides over the whole,</hi> ſays he, <hi>has diſpos'd and complicated all things for the happineſs and virtue of the whole, every part of which, according to the extent of its influence, does and ſuffers what is fit and proper. One of theſe parts is yours, O unhappy man! which tho' in itſelf moſt inconſiderable and minute, yet being connected with the univerſe, ever ſeeks to co-operate with that ſupreme order. You in the mean time are ignorant of the very end for which all particular natures are brought into exiſtence, that the all-comprehending nature of the whole may be perfect and happy; exiſting, as it does, not for your ſake, but the cauſe and reaſon of your exiſtence, which, as in the ſymmetry of every artificial work, muſt of neceſſity concur with the general deſign of the artiſt, and be ſubſervient to the whole of which it is a part. Your complaint therefore is ignorant and groundleſs; ſince according to the various energy of creation, and the common laws of nature, there is a conſtant proviſion of that which is beſt at the ſame time for you and for the whole.—For the governing intelligence clearly beholding all the actions of animated and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving creatures, and that mixture of good and evil which diverſifies them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering firſt of all by what diſpoſition of things, and what ſituation of each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual in the general ſyſtem, vice might be depreſſed and ſubdued, and virtue made ſecure of victory and happineſs with the greateſt facility and in the higheſt degree poſſible. In this manner he order'd thro' the entire circle of being, the internal conſtitution of every mind, where ſhould be its ſtation in the univerſal fabric, and thro' what variety of circumſtances it ſhould proceed in the whole tenour of its exiſtence.</hi> He goes on in his ſublime manner to aſſert a future ſtate of retribution, <hi>as well for thoſe who, by the exerciſe of good diſpoſitions being harmonized and aſſimilated to the divine virtue, are conſequently removed to a place of unblemiſh'd ſanctity and happineſs; as of thoſe who by the moſt flagitious arts have ariſen from contemptible beginnings to the greateſt affluence and power, and whom therefore you look upon as unanſwerable inſtances of negligence in the Gods, becauſe you are ignorant of the purpoſes to which they are ſubſervient, and in what manner they contribute to that ſupreme intention of good to the whole.</hi>

                        </q> The influence of the imagination on the conduct of life is one of the moſt important points in moral philoſophy. It were eaſy by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of facts to prove that the imagination directs almoſt all the paſſions, and mixes with almoſt every circumſtance of action or pleaſure. Let any man, even of the coldeſt head and ſobereſt induſtry, analyſe the idea of what he calls his intereſt; he will find that it conſiſts chiefly of certain images of decency, beauty and order, variouſly combined into one ſyſtem, the idol which he ſeeks to injoy by labour, hazard, and ſelf-denial. It is on this account of the laſt conſequence to regulate theſe images by the ſtandard of nature and the general good; otherwiſe the imagination, by heightening ſome objects beyond their real excellence and beauty, or by repreſenting others in a more odious or terrible ſhape than they deſerve, may of courſe engage us in purſuits utterly inconſiſtent with the laws of the moral order.</p>
                     <p>If it be objected, that this account of things ſuppoſes the paſſions to be merely accidental, whereas there appears in ſome a natural and hereditary diſpoſition to certain paſſions prior to all circumſtances of education or fortune; it may be anſwer'd, that tho' no man is born <hi>ambitious</hi> or a <hi>miſer,</hi> yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind, which ſhall render his imagination more liable to be ſtruck with ſome particular objects, conſequently diſpoſe him to form opinions of good and ill, and entertain paſſions of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular turn. Some men, for inſtance, by the original frame of their minds, are more delighted with the vaſt and magnificent, others on the contrary with the elegant and gentle aſpects of nature. And it is very remarkable, that the diſpoſition of the moral powers is always ſimilar to this of the imagination; that thoſe who are moſt inclin'd to admire prodigious and ſublime objects in the phyſical world, are alſo moſt inclin'd to applaud examples of fortitude and heroic virtue in the moral.

                        </q> By comparing theſe general ſources of ridicule with each other, and examining the ridiculous in other objects, we may obtain a general definition of it equally applicable to every ſpecies. The moſt important circumſtance of this definition is laid down in the lines referr'd to; but others more minute we ſhall ſubjoin here. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s account of the matter ſeems both imperfect and falſe; <q rend="inline">

                           <bibl>(<hi>Poetic. c.</hi> v.)</bibl>
                        </q> For allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be true, as it is not, that the ridiculous is never accompany'd with pain, yet we might produce many inſtances of ſuch a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ridiculous. So that the definition does not diſtinguiſh the thing defined. Nay farther, even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the deſtruction of its ſubject, we may ſtill be ſenſible of a ridiculous appearance, till the ruin become imminent and the keener ſenſations of pity or terror baniſh the ludicrous apprehenſion from our minds. For the ſenſation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or diſagreement of ideas; but a paſſion or emotion of the mind conſequential to that perception. So that the mind may perceive the agreement or diſagreement, and yet not feel the ridiculous, becauſe it is engroſſed by a more violent emotion. Thus it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that ſome men think thoſe objects ridiculous, to which others cannot endure to apply the name; becauſe in them they excite a much intenſer and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant feeling. And this difference, among other cauſes, has brought a good deal of confuſion into this queſtion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That which makes objects ridiculous is ſome ground of admiration or eſteem connected with other more general circumſtances, comparatively worthleſs or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; or it is ſome circumſtance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general excellent or beautiful: the inconſiſtent properties exiſting either in the objects themſelves, or in the apprehenſion of the perſon to whom they relate; belonging always to the ſame order or claſs of being, implying ſentiment or deſign; and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To prove the ſeveral parts of this definition: <hi>The appearance of excellence or beauty connected with a general condition comparatively ſordid or deformed,</hi> is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; for inſtance, pompous pretenſions to wiſdom join'd with ignorance and folly in the <hi>Socrates</hi> of <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi>; and the applauſe of military glory with cowardice and ſtupidity in the <hi>Thraſo</hi> of <hi>Terence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general excellent or venerable,</hi> is alſo ridiculous: for inſtance, the perſonal weakneſſes of a magiſtrate appearing in the ſolemn and public functions of his ſtation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The incongruous properties may either exiſt in the objects themſelves, or in the apprehenſion of the perſon to whom they relate:</hi> in the laſt-mention'd inſtances they both exiſt in the objects; in the inſtance from <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> one of them is objective and real, the other only founded in the apprehenſion of the ridiculous character.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The inconſiſtent properties muſt belong to the ſame order or claſs of being.</hi> A coxcomb in fine cloaths bedaubed by accident in foul weather, is a ridiculous object; becauſe his general apprehenſion of excellence and eſteem is referr'd to the ſplendour and expence of his dreſs. A man of ſenſe and merit in the ſame circumſtances, is not counted ridiculous; becauſe the general ground of excellence and eſteem in him, is, both in fact and in his own apprehenſion, of a very different ſpecies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Every ridiculous object implies ſentiment or deſign.</hi> A column placed by an architect without a capital or baſe, is laugh'd at: the ſame column in a ruin cauſes a very different ſenſation.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, <hi>the occurrence muſt excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart,</hi> ſuch as terror, pity, or indignation; for in that caſe, as was obſerv'd above, the mind is not at leiſure to contemplate the ridiculous.</p>
                     <p>Whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this deſcription, and whether it comprehend every ſpecies and form of the ridiculous, muſt be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by repeated applications of it to particular inſtances.</p>

                        </q> Since it is beyond all contradiction evident that we have a <hi>natural</hi> ſenſe or feeling of the ridiculous, and ſince ſo good a reaſon may be aſſign'd to juſtify the ſupreme being for beſtowing it; one cannot without aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reflect on the conduct of thoſe men who imagine it is for the ſervice of true religion to vilify and blacken it without diſtinction, and endeavour to perſuade us that it is never applied but in a bad cauſe. Ridicule is not concerned with meer ſpeculative truth or falſehood. It is not in abſtract propoſitions or theorems, but in actions and paſſions, good and evil, beauty and deformity, that we find mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for it; and all theſe terms are <hi>relative,</hi> implying approbation or blame. To aſk then <hi>whether ridicule be a teſt of truth,</hi> is, in other words, to aſk whether that which is ridiculous can be <hi>morally true,</hi> can be juſt and becoming; or whether that which is juſt and becoming, can be ridiculous. A queſtion that does not deſerve a ſerious anſwer. For it is moſt evident, that as in a metaphyſical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition offer'd to the underſtanding for its aſſent, the faculty of reaſon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the terms of the propoſition, and finding one idea which was ſuppoſed equal to another, to be in fact unequal, of conſequence rejects the propoſition as a falſehood: ſo in objects offer'd to the mind for its eſteem or applauſe, the faculty of ridicule feeling an incongruity in the claim, urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt. When therefore we obſerve ſuch a claim obtruded upon mankind, and the inconſiſtent circumſtances carefully concealed from the eye of public, it is our buſineſs, if the matter be of importance to ſociety, to drag out thoſe latent circumſtances, and by ſetting them full in view, convince the world how ridiculous the claim is; and thus a double advantage is gained; for we both detect the <hi>moral falſehood</hi> ſooner than in the way of ſpeculative inquiry, and impreſs the minds of men with a ſtronger ſenſe of the vanity and error of its authors. And this and no more is meant by the application of ridicule.</p>
                     <p>But it is ſaid, the practice is dangerous, and may be inconſiſtent with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence. I anſwer, the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous; men may be diſhoneſt in obtruding circumſtances foreign to the object, and we may be inadvertent in allowing thoſe circumſtances to impoſe upon us; but the ſenſe of ridicule always judges right: the <hi>Socrates</hi> of <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> is as <hi>truly</hi> ridiculous a character as ever was drawn.—True; but it is not the character of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the divine moraliſt and father of ancient wiſdom. What then? did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philoſopher from detecting and diſclaiming thoſe foreign circumſtances which he had falſely introduced into his character, and thus rendering the ſatiriſt doubly ridiculous in his turn? No: but it nevertheleſs had an ill influence on the minds of the people. And ſo has the reaſoning of <hi>Spinoza</hi> made many atheiſts; he has founded it indeed on ſuppoſitions utterly falſe, but allow him theſe, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions are unavoidably true. And if we muſt reject the uſe of ridicule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the impoſition of falſe circumſtances, things may be made to ſeem ridiculous, which are not ſo in themſelves; why we ought not in the ſame manner to reject the uſe of reaſon, becauſe by proceeding on falſe principles, concluſions will appear true which are impoſſible in nature, let the vehement and obſtinate declaimers againſt ridicule determine.</p>
