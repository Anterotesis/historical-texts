            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is certainly no
Place in the World where
a Man may Travel with
greater Pleaſure and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
than in <hi>Italy.</hi>
One finds ſomething more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in the Face of the Country, and
more aſtoniſhing in the Works of
Nature, than can be met with in
any other Part of <hi>Europe.</hi> It is
the great School of Muſick and
Painting, and contains in it all the
nobleſt Productions of Statuary and
Architecture both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern.
It abounds with Cabinets of
Curioſities, and vaſt Collections of
all Kinds of Antiquities. No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Country in the World has ſuch
a Variety of Governments, that
are ſo different in their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and ſo refined in their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks.
<pb facs="tcp:0168900800:9"/>
There is ſcarce any Part
of the Nation that is not Famous
in Hiſtory, nor ſo much as a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or River that has not been the
Scene of ſome extraordinary Action.</p>
            <p>As there are few Men that have
Talents or Opportunities for exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
ſo copious a Subject, one
may obſerve among thoſe who have
written on <hi>Italy,</hi> that different Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have ſucceeded beſt on diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſorts of Curioſities. Some have
been more particular in their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of Pictures, Statues and
Buildings; ſome have ſearch'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Libraries, Cabinets of Rarities,
and Collections of Medals, as others
have been wholly taken up with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
Ruins and Antiquities.
Among the Authors of our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
we are obliged to the Biſhop of
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> for his maſterly and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Obſervations on the Religion and
Governments of <hi>Italy</hi>: <hi>Laſſels</hi> may
be uſeful in giving us the Names of
ſuch Writers as have treated of the
ſeveral States through which he
<pb facs="tcp:0168900800:10"/>
paſs'd: Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> is to be valu'd for
his Obſervations on the Natural
Productions of the Place. Monſieur
<hi>Miſſion</hi> has wrote a more correct
Account of <hi>Italy</hi> in general than
any before him, as he particularly
Excels in the Plan of the Country,
which he has given us in true and
lively Colours.</p>
            <p>There are ſtill ſeveral of theſe
Topicks that are far from being
exhauſted, as there are many new
Subjects that a Traveller may find
to employ himſelf upon. For my
own part, as I have taken Notice of
ſeveral Places and Antiquities that
no Body elſe has ſpoken of, ſo, I
think, I have mentioned but few
Things in common with others, that
are notei ther ſet in a new Light,
or accompany'd with different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.
I have taken care parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to conſider the ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of the Ancient Poets, which
have any Relation to the Places
or Curioſities that I met with: For
before I entered on my Voyage I took
<pb facs="tcp:0168900800:11"/>
care to refreſh my Memory among
the <hi>Claſſic</hi> Authors, and to make
ſuch Collections out of them as I
might afterwards have Occaſion
for. I muſt confeſs it was not one
of the leaſt Entertainments that I
met with in Travelling, to examine
theſe ſeveral Deſcriptions, as it
were, upon the Spot, and to compare
the Natural Face of the Country
with the Landskips that the Poets
have given us of it. However,
to avoid the Confuſion that might
ariſe from a Multitude of Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I have only cited ſuch Verſes
as have given us ſome Image of the
Place, or that have ſomething elſe
beſides the bare Name of it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
them.</p>

            <p>There are but Three Towns in the
Dominions of the Prince of <hi>Monaco.</hi> The
chief of them is ſituate on a Rock which
runs out into the Sea, and is well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by Nature. It was formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Protection of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but
not many Years ſince drove out the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Garriſon, and received a <hi>French</hi> one,
which conſiſts at preſent of Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Men, paid and officer'd by the
<hi>French</hi> King. The Officer who ſhowed
me the Palace told me, with a great deal of
Gravity, that his Maſter and the King
of <hi>France,</hi> amidſt all the Confuſions of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0168900800:28"/>
               <hi>Europe,</hi> had ever been good Friends and
Allies. The Palace has handſome Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that are many of them hung with
Pictures of the reigning Beauties in the
Court of <hi>France.</hi> But the beſt of the
Furniture was at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Prince
of <hi>Monaco</hi> reſided at that time Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.
We here took a little Boat to creep
along the Sea-ſhore as far as <hi>Genoa</hi>; but
at <hi>Savona,</hi> finding the Sea too rough,
we were forced to make the beſt of our
way by Land, over very rugged Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Precipices: For this Road is
much more difficult than that over
Mount <hi>Cennis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Genoeſe</hi> are eſteemed extremely
Cunning, Induſtrious, and inur'd to
Hardſhip above the reſt of the <hi>Italians</hi>;
which was likewiſe the Character of the
old <hi>Ligurians.</hi> And indeed it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
while the Barrenneſs of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
continues, that the Manners of the
Inhabitants do not change: Since there is
nothing makes Men ſharper, and ſets
their Hands and Wits more at work than
Want. The <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb ſays of the
<hi>Genoeſe,</hi> that they have a Sea without
Fiſh, Land without Trees, and Men
without Faith. The Character the
<hi>Latin</hi> Poets have given of them is not
much different.<q>

            <p>There are a great many beautiful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
ſtanding along the Sea-ſhore on both
ſides of <hi>Genoa,</hi> which make the Town ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0168900800:30"/>
much longer than it is, to thoſe that
fail by it. The City it ſelf makes the nobleſt
Show of any in the World. The Houſes are
moſt of them painted on the Outſide; ſo
that they look extreamly gay and lively,
beſides that they are eſteemed the higheſt
in <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſtand very thick together.
The New-Street is a double Range
of Palaces from one end to the other,
built with an excellent Fancy, and fit
for the greateſt Princes to inhabit. I
cannot however be reconciled to their
manner of Painting ſeveral of the <hi>Genoeſe</hi>
Houſes. Figures, Perſpectives, or Pieces
of Hiſtory are certainly very ornamental,
as they are drawn on many of the Walls,
that would otherwiſe look too naked and
uniform without them: But inſtead of
theſe, one often ſees the Front of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
covered with painted Pillars of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Orders. If theſe were ſo many true
Columns of Marble, ſet in their proper
Architecture, they would certainly very
much adorn the Places where they ſtand,
but as they are now, they only ſhew us
that there is ſomething wanting, and that
the Palace, which without theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Pillars would be beautiful in its
kind, might have been more perfect by
the Addition of ſuch as are real. The
Front of the <hi>Villa Imperiale,</hi> at a Mile
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0168900800:31"/>
diſtance from <hi>Genoa,</hi> without any thing
of this Paint upon it, conſiſts of a <hi>Doric</hi>
and <hi>Corinthian</hi> Row of Pillars, and is
much the handſomeſt of any I there ſaw.
The Duke of <hi>Doria</hi>'s Palace has the beſt
Outſide of any in <hi>Genoa,</hi> as that of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razzo</hi>
is the beſt furniſhed within. There
is one Room in the firſt, that is hung
with Tapeſtry, in which are wrought the
Figures of the great Perſons, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
has produced; as perhaps there is
no Houſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> that can ſhow a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Line of Heroes, that have ſtill acted
for the Good of their Country. <hi>Andrew
Doria</hi> has a Statue erected to him at the
Entrance of the Doge's Palace, with the
glorious Title of Deliverer of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
and one of his Family ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that calls him its Preſerver. In the
Doge's Palace, are the Rooms, where the
great and little Council with the Two
Colleges hold their Aſſemblies; but as
the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> is very poor, tho' ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of its Members are extreamly rich,
ſo one may obſerve infinitely more Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and Magnificence, in particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
Houſes, than in thoſe that belong
to the Publick. But we find in moſt of
the States of <hi>Europe,</hi> that the People ſhow
the greateſt Marks of Poverty, where
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0168900800:32"/>
the Governors live in the greateſt Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.
The Churches are very fine,
particularly that of the Annunciation,
which looks wonderfully beautiful in the
Inſide, all but one Corner of it being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Statues, Gilding and Paint.
A Man would expect, in ſo very ancient
a Town of <hi>Italy,</hi> to find ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Antiquities; but all they have to ſhow
of this Nature is an old <hi>Roſtrum</hi> of a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Ship, that ſtands over the Door of
their Arſenal. It is not above a Foot long,
and perhaps would never have been
thought the Beak of a Ship, had not it
been found in ſo probable a Place as the
Haven. It is all of Iron, faſhioned at the
End like a Boar's Head; as I have ſeen
it repreſented on Medals, and on the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumna
Roſtrata</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi> I ſaw at <hi>Genoa</hi>
Signior <hi>Micconi</hi>'s famous Collection of
Shells, which, as Father <hi>Buonani</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuite
has ſince told me, is one of the beſt
in <hi>Italy.</hi> I know nothing more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
in the Government of <hi>Genoa,</hi> than
the Bank of St. <hi>George,</hi> made up of ſuch
Branches of the Revenues, as have been
ſet apart, and appropriated to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of ſeveral Sums, that have been
borrowed from private Perſons, during
the Exigencies of the Common-wealth.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0168900800:33"/>
Whatever Inconveniencies the State has
laboured under, they have never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a Thought of violating the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Credit, or of alienating any Part of
theſe Revenues to other Uſes, than to
what they have been thus aſſigned. The
Adminiſtration of this Bank is for Life,
and partly in the Hands of the chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
which gives them a great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the State, and a powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
over the common people. This
Bank is generally thought the greateſt
Load on the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> and the Managers
of it have been repreſented as a ſecond
kind of Senate, that break the Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Government, and deſtroy, in ſome
meaſure, the Fundamental Conſtitution
of the State. It is however very certain,
that the People reap no ſmall Advantages
from it, as it diſtributes the Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
more particular Members of the
Republick, and gives the Commons a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure:
So that it is no ſmall Check up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ariſtocracy, and may be one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Senate carries it with
greater Moderation towards their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
than the <hi>Venetian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would have been well for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
of <hi>Genoa,</hi> if ſhe had followed the
Example of her Siſter of <hi>Venice,</hi> in not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0168900800:34"/>
permitting her Nobles to make any Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
of Lands or Houſes in the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of a Foreign Prince. For at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the Greateſt, among the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> are
in part Subjects to the Monarchy of
<hi>Spain,</hi> by reaſon of their Eſtates that lye
in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
Tax them very high upon occaſion,
and are ſo ſenſible of the Advantage this
gives them over the Republick, that
they will not ſuffer a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> to buy
the Lands of a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> who muſt find
a Purchaſer among his own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
if he has a Mind to ſell. For this
Reaſon, as well as on Account of the
great Sums of Mony which the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
owes the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> they are under a
Neceſſity, at preſent, of being in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the <hi>French,</hi> and would probably
continue ſo, tho' all the other States of
<hi>Italy</hi> entered into a League againſt them.
<hi>Genoa</hi> is not yet ſecure from a Bombard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
tho' it is not ſo expoſed as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for, ſince the Inſult of the <hi>French,</hi>
they have built a Mole, with ſome little
Ports, and have provided themſelves with
long Guns and Mortars. It is eaſie for
thoſe that are ſtrong at Sea to bring them
to what Terms they pleafe; for having but
very little Arable Land, they are forced to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0168900800:35"/>
fetch all their Corn from <hi>Naples, Sicily,</hi>
and other Foreign Countries; except
what comes to them from <hi>Lombardy,</hi>
which probably goes another way,
whilſt it furniſhes Two great Armies
with Proviſions. Their Fleet, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
gained ſo many Victories over the
<hi>Saracens, Piſans, Venetians, Turks</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
that made them Maſters of <hi>Crete,</hi>
               <hi>Sardinia, Majorca, Minorca, Negrepont,</hi>
               <hi>Lesbos, Malta,</hi> that ſettled them in <hi>Scio,</hi>
               <hi>Smyrna, Achaia, Theodoſia,</hi> and ſeveral
Towns on the Eaſtern Confines of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
is now reduced to Six Gallies. When
they had made an Addition of but Four
new ones, the King of <hi>France</hi> ſent his
Orders to ſuppreſs them, telling the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
at the ſame time, that he knew
very well how many they had Occaſion
for. This little Fleet ſerves only to fetch
them Wine and Corn, and to give their
Ladies an Airing in the Summer-ſeaſon.
The Republick of <hi>Genoa</hi> has a Crown
and Scepter for its Doge, by reaſon of
their Conqueſt of <hi>Corſica,</hi> where there
was formerly a <hi>Saracen</hi> King. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
gives their Ambaſſadors a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Reception at ſome Courts, but,
at the ſame time, may teach their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to have a mean Notion of their own
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0168900800:36"/>
Form of Government, and is a tacit Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
that Monarchy is the
more honourable. The old <hi>Romans,</hi> on
the contrary, made uſe of a very barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
kind of Politicks to inſpire their
People with a Contempt of Kings, whom
they treated with Infamy, and dragged
at the Wheels of their Triumphal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots.</p>

We here ſaw the Convent of <hi>Auſtin</hi>
Monks, who about Three Years ago
pretended to have found out the Body
of the Saint, that gives the Name to
their Order. King <hi>Luitprand,</hi> whoſe
Aſhes are in the ſame Church, brought
hither the Corps, and was very induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to conceal it, leſt it might be abuſed
by the barbarous Nations, which at that
time ravaged <hi>Italy.</hi> One would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rather wonder that it has not been
found out much earlier, than that it is
diſcovered at laſt. The Fathers howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
do not yet find their Account in the
Diſcovery they have made; for there are
Canons Regular, who have half the ſame
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0168900800:38"/>
Church in their Hands, that will by no
means allow it to be the Body of the
Saint, nor is it yet recogniſed by the
Pope. The Monks ſay for themſelves,
that the very Name was written on the
Urn where the Aſhes lay, and that in
an old Record of the Convent, they are
ſaid to have been interred between the
very Wall and the Altar where they
were taken up. They have already too,
as the Monks told us, begun to juſtifie
themſelves by Miracles. At the Corner
of one of the Cloiſters of this Convent
are bury'd the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who were both killed
in the famous Battel of <hi>Pavia.</hi> Their

            <p>In <hi>Pavia</hi> is an Univerſity of Seven Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
one of them called the College of
<hi>Borromee,</hi> very large, and nearly built.
There is likewiſe a Statue in Braſs, of
<hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> on Horſeback, which
the People of the Place call <hi>Charles</hi> the
Fifth, and ſome learned Men <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
the Great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pavia</hi> is the <hi>Ticinum</hi> of the Ancients,
which took its Name from the River
<hi>Ticinus</hi> which runs by it, and is now
call'd the <hi>Teſin.</hi> This River falls into the
<hi>Po,</hi> and is exceſſively rapid. The Biſhop
of <hi>Salisbury</hi> ſays, that he ran down with
the Stream Thirty Miles in an Hour, by
the help of but one Rower. I do not
know therefore why <hi>Silius Italicus</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
it as ſo very gentle and ſtill a
River, in the beautiful Deſcription he
has given us of it.<q>

                  <l>And through the Chryſtal Stream the

            <p>A Poet of another Nation would not
have dwelt ſo long upon the Clearneſs
and Tranſparency of the Stream, but in
<hi>Italy</hi> one ſeldom ſees a River that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
bright and limpid, moſt of them
falling down from the Mountains, that
make their Waters very troubled and
muddy, whereas the <hi>Teſin</hi> is only an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
of that vaſt Lake, which the <hi>Italians</hi>
now call the <hi>Lago Maggiore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſaw between <hi>Pavia</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> the
Convent of <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> which is very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and beautiful. Their Church is
extreamly fine, and curiouſly adorned,
but of a <hi>Gothic</hi> Structure.</p>
            <p>I could not ſtay long in <hi>Milan</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
going to ſee the Great Church that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0168900800:42"/>
I had heard ſo much of, but was never
more deceived in my Expectation than
at my firſt entering: For the Front,
which was all I had ſeen of the Outſide,
is not half finiſhed, and the Inſide is ſo
ſmutted with Duſt, and the Smoak of
Lamps, that neither the Marble, nor
the Silver, nor Braſs-Works ſhow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to an Advantage. This vaſt <hi>Gothic</hi>
Pile of Building is all of Marble, except
the Roof, which would have been of the
ſame Matter with the reſt, had not its
Weight rendered it improper for that
part of the Building. But for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
I have juſt now mentioned, the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of the Church looks much whiter
and freſher than the Inſide; for where
the Marble is ſo often waſhed with Rains,
it preſerves it ſelf more beautiful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſullyed,
than in thoſe Parts that are not
at all expoſed to the Weather. That
Side of the Church indeed, which faces
the Tramontane Wind, is much more
unſightly than the reſt, by reaſon of the
Duſt and Smoak that are driven againſt
it. This Profuſion of Marble, tho' aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
to Strangers, is not very won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
in a Country that has ſo many
Veins of it within its Bowels. But tho'
the Stones are cheap, the working of
them is very expenſive. It is generally
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0168900800:43"/>
ſaid there are Eleven Thouſand Statues
about the Church, but they reckon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Account every particular Figure
in the Hiſtory-pieces, and ſeveral little
Images which make up the Equipage of
thoſe that are larger. There are indeed a
great Multitude of ſuch as are bigger
than the Life: I reckoned above Two
Hundred and Fifty on the Outſide of
the Church, tho' I only told Three Sides
of it; and theſe are not half ſo thick
ſet as they intend them. The Statues are
all of Marble, and generally well cut; but
the moſt valuable one they have is a
St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> new-flead, with his Skin
hanging over his Shoulders: It is eſteemed
worth its weight in Gold: They have
inſcribed this Verſe on the Pedeſtal, to
ſhow the Value they have for the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

            <p>There is, juſt before the Entrance of
the Quire, a little Subterraneous Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
Dedicated to St. <hi>Charles Borromee,</hi>
where I ſaw his Body, in Epiſcopal
Robes, lying upon the Altar in a Shrine
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0168900800:44"/>
of Rock-Cryſtal. His Chappel is adorned
with abundance of Silver Work: He
was but Two and Twenty Years old
when he was choſen Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
and Forty Six at his Death; but
made ſo good uſe of ſo ſhort a time, by
his Works of Charity and Munificence,
that his Countrymen bleſs his Memory,
which is ſtill freſh among them. He was
Cannoniſed about a Hundred Years ago:
and indeed if this Honour were due to
any Man, I think ſuch Publick-ſpirited
Virtues may lay a juſter Claim to it, than
a ſour Retreat from Mankind, a fiery
Zeal againſt <hi>Heterodoxies,</hi> a Set of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
Viſions, or of Whimſical Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
which are generally the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Roman</hi> Saints. Miracles indeed
are required of all who aſpire to this Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
becauſe they ſay an Hypocrite may
imitate a Saint in all other Particulars,
and theſe they attribute in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to him I am ſpeaking of. His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and the Importunity of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
procured his Canonization before
the ordinary time; for it is the Policy of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church not to allow this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
ordinarily, 'till Fifty Years after
the Death of the Perſon, who is a Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
for it; in which time it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that all his Contemporaries will be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0168900800:45"/>
worn out, who could contradict a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Miracle, or remember any Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the Saint. One would wonder
that <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, who are for this
kind of Worſhip, do not generally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
themſelves to the Holy Apoſtles,
who have a more unqueſtionable Right
to the Title of Saints than thoſe of a
Modern Date; but theſe are at preſent
quite out of Faſhion in <hi>Italy,</hi> where
there is ſcarce a great Town, which does
not pay its Devotions, in a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
manner, to ſome one of their own
making. This renders it very ſuſpicious,
that the Intereſts of Particular Families,
Religious Orders, Convents or Churches,
have too great a Sway in their Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zations.
When I was at <hi>Milan</hi> I ſaw a
Book newly publiſhed, that was Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the preſent Head of the <hi>Borromean</hi>
Family, and entitled, <hi>A Diſcourſe on the
Humility of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and of St.</hi> Charles
Borromee.</p>
            <p>The Great Church of <hi>Milan</hi> has Two
Noble Pulpits of Braſs, each of them run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
round a large Pillar, like a Gallery,
and ſupported by huge Figures of the
ſame Metal. The Hiſtory of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
or rather of the Bleſſed Virgin,
for it begins with her Birth, and ends
with her Coronation in Heaven, that of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0168900800:46"/>
our Saviour coming in by way of <hi>Epiſode</hi>)
is finely cut in Marble by <hi>Andrew Biffy.</hi>
This Church is very Rich in Relicks,
which run up as high as <hi>Daniel, Jonas</hi>
and <hi>Abraham.</hi> Among the reſt they ſhow
a Fragment of our Countryman <hi>Becket,</hi>
as indeed there are very few Treaſuries
of Relicks in <hi>Italy</hi> that have not a Tooth
or a Bone of this Saint. It would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to count up the Riches of Silver,
Gold, and Precious Stones, that are
amaſs'd together in this and ſeveral other
Churches of <hi>Milan.</hi> I was told, that in
<hi>Milan</hi> there are Sixty Convents of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Eighty of Men, and Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Churches. At the <hi>Celeſtines</hi> is a
Picture in Freſco of the Marriage of
<hi>Cana,</hi> very much eſteem'd; but the
Painter, whether deſignedly or not, has
put Six Fingers to the Hand of one of
the Figures: They ſhow the Gates of
a Church that St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſhut againſt
the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> as thinking him
unfit to aſſiſt at Divine Service, 'till he
had done ſome extraordinary Penance
for his barbarous Maſſacring the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Theſſalonica.</hi> That Emperor
was however ſo far from being diſpleas'd
with the Behaviour of the Saint, that
at his Death he committed to him the
Education of his Children. Several have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0168900800:47"/>
pick'd Splinters of Wood out of the
Gates for Relicks. There is a little Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
lately re-edify'd, where the ſame
Saint baptis'd St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> An Inſcription
upon the Wall of it ſays, that it was in
this Chappel, and on this Occaſion, that
he firſt ſung his <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and that his
great Convert anſwered him Verſe by
Verſe. In one of the Churches I ſaw
a Pulpit and Confeſſional, very finely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid
with <hi>Lapis-Lazuli,</hi> and ſeveral kinds
of Marble, by a Father of the Convent.
It is very lucky for a Religious, who has
ſo much Time on his Hands, to be
able to amuſe himſelf with Works of
this Nature; and one often finds parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Members of Convents, who have
excellent Mechanical Genius's, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
themſelves, at leiſure Hours, with
Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening,
and ſeveral kinds of Handy-Crafts.
Since I have mention'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſionals,
I ſhall ſet down here ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
that I have ſeen over them in
<hi>Roman</hi>-Catholick Countries, which are
all Texts of Scripture, and regard either
the Penitent or the Father. <hi>Abi, Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

I ſaw the <hi>Ambroſian</hi> Library,
where, to ſhow the <hi>Italian</hi> Genius, they
have ſpent more Money on Pictures than
on Books. Among the Heads of ſeveral
learned Men I met with no <hi>Engliſhman,</hi>
except Biſhop <hi>Fiſher,</hi> whom <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth put to Death for not owning his
Supremacy. Books are indeed the leaſt
part of the Furniture that one ordinarily
goes to ſee in an <hi>Italian</hi> Library, which
they generally ſet off with Pictures, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and other Ornaments, where they
can afford them, after the Example of
the old <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi>

            <p>In an Apartment behind the Library
are ſeveral Rarities often deſcribed
by Travellers, as <hi>Brugeal</hi>'s Elements, a
Head of <hi>Titian</hi> by his own Hand, a
Manuſcript in <hi>Latin</hi> of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> which
the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> ſays was written
about the Age of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and another
of <hi>Leonardus Vincius,</hi> which King <hi>James</hi>
the Firſt could not procure, tho' he
proffered for it Three Thouſand <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Piſtols. It conſiſts of Deſignings in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm
and Engineering: I was ſhown
in it a Sketch of Bombs and Mortars, as
they are now uſed. Canon <hi>Settala</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet
is always ſhown to a Stranger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Curioſities of <hi>Milan,</hi> which I
ſhall not be particular upon, the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Account of it being common enough.
Among its Natural Curioſities I took
particular notice of a Piece of Chryſtal,
that enclos'd a couple of Drops, which
look'd like Water when they were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
tho' perhaps they are nothing but
Bubbles of Air. It is ſuch a Rarity as
this that I ſaw at <hi>Vendome</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0168900800:50"/>
which they there pretend is a Tear that
our Saviour ſhed over <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and was
gather'd up by an Angel, who put it
in a little Chryſtal Vial, and made a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of it to <hi>Mary Magdalene.</hi> The
Famous <hi>Pere Mabillon</hi> is now engag'd in
the Vindication of this Tear, which a
learned Eccleſiaſtic, in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of <hi>Vendome,</hi> would have ſuppreſſed,
as a falſe and ridiculous Relick, in
a Book that he has Dedicated to
his Dioceſan the Biſhop of <hi>Blois.</hi> It is
in the Poſſeſſion of a <hi>Benedictin</hi> Convent,
which raiſes a conſiderable Revenue out
of the Devotion that is paid to it, and
has now retained the moſt learned Father
of their Order to write in its Defence.</p>
            <p>It was ſuch a Curioſity as this I have
mention'd, that <hi>Claudian</hi> has celebrated
in about half a Score Epigrams.<q>

The Citadel of <hi>Milan</hi> is thought a
ſtrong Fort in <hi>Italy,</hi> and has held out
formerly after the Conqueſt of the
reſt of the Dutchy. The Governor of it
is independent on the Governor of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>;
as the <hi>Perſians</hi> uſed to make the
Rulers of Provinces and Fortreſſes of
different Conditions and Intereſts, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Conſpiracies.</p>
            <p>At Two Miles diſtance from <hi>Milan</hi>
there ſtands a Building, that would have
been a Maſter-piece in its kind, had the
Architect deſign'd it for an Artificial
Echo. We diſcharg'd a Piſtol, and had
the Sound return'd upon us above Fifty
Six times, tho' the Air was very foggy.
The firſt Repetitions follow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
very thick, but are heard more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
in proportion as they decay:
There are Two parallel Walls which beat
the Sound back on each other, 'till the
Undulation is quite worn out, like the
ſeveral Reverberations of the ſame Image
from two oppoſite Looking-Glaſſes.
Father <hi>Kircher</hi> has taken notice of this
particular Echo, as Father <hi>Bartolin</hi> has
done ſince in his Ingenious Diſcourſe on
Sounds. The State of <hi>Milan</hi> is like a
vaſt Garden, ſurrounded by a Noble
Mound-Work of Rocks and Mountains:
Indeed if a Man conſiders the Face of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0168900800:54"/>
               <hi>Italy</hi> in general, one would think that
Nature had laid it out into ſuch a Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of States and Governments as one
finds in it. For as the <hi>Alpes</hi> at one End,
and the long Range of <hi>Appenines,</hi> that
paſſes thro' the Body of it, branch out
on all ſides into ſeveral different Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
they ſerve as ſo many natural Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries
and Fortifications to the little Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
that lye among them. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
we find the whole Country cut
into a Multitude of particular King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Common-wealths in the oldeſt
Accounts we have of it, 'till the Power
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> like a Torrent that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflows
its Banks, bore down all before
it, and ſpread it ſelf into the remoteſt
Corners of the Nation. But as this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
Power became unable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it ſelf, we find the Government of
<hi>Italy</hi> again broken into ſuch a Variety
of Sub-Diviſions, as naturally ſuits with
its Situation.</p>
            <p>In the Court of <hi>Milan,</hi> as in ſeveral
others of <hi>Italy,</hi> there are many who fall
in with the Dreſs and Carriage of the
<hi>French.</hi> One may however obſerve a kind
of Awkwardneſs in the <hi>Italians,</hi> which ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
diſcovers the Airs they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
not to be natural. It is indeed
very ſtrange there ſhould be ſuch a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0168900800:55"/>
Diverſity of Manners, where there is
ſo ſmall a difference in the Air and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.
The <hi>French</hi> are always Open,
Familiar and Talkative: The <hi>Italians,</hi>
on the contrary, are Stiff, Ceremonious
and Reſerved. In <hi>France</hi> every one
aims at a Gaiety and Sprightlineſs of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
and thinks it an Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be brisk and lively: The <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
notwithſtanding their natural Fieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Temper, affect always to appear
Sober and Sedate; inſomuch that one
ſometimes meets Young Men walking
the Streets with Spectacles on their
Noſes, that they may be thought to
have impaired their Sight by much
Study, and ſeem more Grave and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
than their Neighbours. This Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Manners proceeds chiefly
from Difference of Education: In <hi>France</hi>
it is uſual to bring their Children into
Company, and to cheriſh in them, from
their Infancy, a kind of Forwardneſs
and Aſſurance: Beſides, that the <hi>French</hi>
apply themſelves more univerſally to their
Exerciſes than any other Nation in the
World, ſo that one ſeldom ſees a Young
Gentleman in <hi>France</hi> that does not Fence,
Dance, and Ride in ſome tolerable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Theſe Agitations of the Body
do not only give them a free and eaſie
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0168900800:56"/>
Carriage, but have a kind of Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Operation on the Mind, by keeping
the Animal Spirits always awake and in
Motion. But what contributes moſt
to this light airy Humour of the <hi>French,</hi>
is the Free Converſation that is allowed
them with their Women, which does
not only communicate to them a certain
Vivacity of Temper, but makes them
endeavour after ſuch a Behaviour as is
moſt taking with the Sex.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Italians,</hi> on the contrary, who are
excluded from making their Court this
way, are for recommending themſelves
to thoſe they Converſe with by their
Gravity and Wiſdom. In <hi>Spain</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
where there are fewer Liberties
of this Nature allowed, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſtill more ſerious and compoſed in
the manner of the Inhabitants. But
as Mirth is more apt to make Proſelytes
than Melancholy, it is obſerved that the
<hi>Italians</hi> have many of them for theſe late
Years given very far into the Modes
and Freedoms of the <hi>French</hi>; which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
more or leſs in the Courts of <hi>Italy,</hi>
as they lye at a ſmaller or greater Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from <hi>France.</hi> It may be here
worth while to conſider how it comes
to paſs, that the Common People of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
have in general ſo very great an Averſion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0168900800:57"/>
to the <hi>French,</hi> which every Traveller
cannot but be ſenſible of, that has paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thro' the Country. The moſt obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reaſon is certainly the great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that there is in the Humours and
Manners of the Two Nations, which
always works more in the meaner
ſort, who are not able to vanquiſh the
Prejudices of Education, than with the
Nobility. Beſides, that the <hi>French</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
in regard of the Liberties they
take in Female Converſations, and their
great Ambition to Excel in all Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
is in a more particular manner very
ſhocking to the <hi>Italians,</hi> who are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Jealous, and value themſelves upon
their great Wiſdom. At the ſame time
the common People of <hi>Italy,</hi> who run
more into News and Politicks than thoſe
of other Countries, have all of them
ſomething to exaſperate them againſt the
King of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Savoyards,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the preſent Inclinations
of their Court, cannot forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
the infinite Miſchiefs he did
them in the laſt War. The <hi>Milaneſe</hi>
and <hi>Neapolitans</hi> remember the many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
he has offer'd to the Houſe of
<hi>Auſtria,</hi> and particularly to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
King, for whom they ſtill retain
a natural kind of Honour and Affection.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0168900800:58"/>
The <hi>Genoeſe</hi> cannot forget his Treatment
of their Doge, and his Bombarding their
City. The <hi>Venetians</hi> will tell you of his
Leagues with the <hi>Turks</hi>; and the <hi>Romans,</hi>
of his Threats to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
whoſe Memory they adore. It is
true, that Intereſt of State, and Change
of Circumſtances, may have ſweetened
theſe Reflections to the Politer ſort, but
Impreſſions are not ſo eaſily worn out
of the Minds of the Vulgar. That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
which I take to be the Principal
Motive among moſt of the <hi>Italians,</hi> for
their favouring the <hi>Germans</hi> above the
<hi>French,</hi> is this, that they are entirely
perſuaded it is for the Intereſt of <hi>Italy,</hi>
to have <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> rather in the
Hands of the firſt than of the other.
One may generally obſerve, that the
Body of a People has juſter Views for
the Publick Good, and purſues them
with greater Uprightneſs than the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry, who have ſo many
private Expectations and particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
which hang like a falſe Biaſs upon
their Judgments, and may poſſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them to ſacrifice the Good of their
Country to the Advancement of their
own Fortunes; whereas the Groſs of the
People can have no other Proſpect in
Changes and Revolutions than of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0168900800:59"/>
Bleſſings, that are to diffuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
thro' the whole State in general.</p>

to <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and by the way
croſs'd the River <hi>Adda,</hi> that
falls into the <hi>Lago di Como,</hi>
which <hi>Virgil</hi> calls the Lake <hi>Larius,</hi> and
running out at the other End loſes it ſelf
at laſt in the <hi>Po,</hi> which is the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
of all the Rivers of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
The Town and Province of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcia</hi>
have freer Acceſs to the Senate of
<hi>Venice,</hi> and a quicker Redreſs of Injuries,
than any other Part of their Dominions.
They have always a mild and prudent
Governor, and live much more happily
than their Fellow-Subjects: For as they
were once a Part of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> and
are now on their Frontiers, the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
dare not exaſperate them, by the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0168900800:62"/>
Loads they lay on other Provinces, for
fear of a Revolt; and are forc'd to Treat
them with much more Indulgence than
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do their Neighbours, that
they may have no Temptation to it.
<hi>Breſcia</hi> is famous for its Iron-Works.
A ſmall Day's Journey more brought us

in our way, which the <hi>Italians</hi> now call
<hi>Lago di Garda</hi>: It was ſo rough with

without any Pedeſtal or Baſis, as <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi>
has deſcribed them. I have not
yet ſeen any Gardens in <hi>Italy</hi> worth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of. The <hi>Italians</hi> fall as far
ſhort of the <hi>French</hi> in this Particular, as
they excel them in their Palaces. It
muſt however be ſaid, to the Honour
of the <hi>Italians,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> took from
them the firſt Plans of their Gardens, as
well as of their Water-Works; ſo that
their ſurpaſſing of them at preſent is to
be attributed rather to the Greatneſs of
their Riches, than the Excellence of
their Taſte. I ſaw the Terrace-Garden
of <hi>Verona,</hi> that Travellers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
mention. Among the Churches of
<hi>Verona,</hi> that of St. <hi>George</hi> is the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt:
Its chief Ornament is the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
of the Saint, drawn by <hi>Paul
Veroneſe</hi>; as there are many other Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
about the Town by the ſame
Hand. A Stranger is always ſhown the
Tomb of Pope <hi>Lucius,</hi> who lyes buried
in the Dome. I ſaw in the ſame Church
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0168900800:67"/>
a Monument erected by the Publick to
one of their Biſhops: The Inſcription
ſays, that there was between him and
his Maker, <hi>Summa Neceſſitudo, Summa
Similitudo.</hi> The <hi>Italian</hi> Epitaphs are
often more extravagant than thoſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countries, as the Nation is more
given to Compliment and Hyperbole.
From <hi>Verona</hi> to <hi>Padua</hi> we travelled thro'
a very pleaſant Country: It is planted
thick with Rows of White Mulberry-trees,
that furniſh Food for great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Silk-worms with their Leaves,
as the Swine and Poultry conſume the
Fruit. The Trees themſelves ſerve, at
the ſame time, as ſo many Stays for their
Vines, which hang all along like Garlands
from Tree to Tree. Between the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Ranges lye Fields of Corn, which in
theſe warm Countries ripens much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
among the Mulberry Shades, than if
it were expoſed to the open Sun. This
was one Reaſon why the Inhabitants of
this Country, when I paſſed thro' it,
were extreamly apprehenſive of ſeeing
<hi>Lombardy</hi> the Seat of War, which muſt
have made miſerable Havock among
their Plantations; for it is not here as in
the Corn Fields of <hi>Flanders,</hi> where the
whole Product of the Place riſes from
Year to Year. We arrived ſo late at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0168900800:68"/>
that we had not time to take a
full Sight of the Place. The next Day
brought us to <hi>Padua.</hi> St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> who
lived about Five Hundred Years ago, is
the great Saint to whom they here pay
their Devotions. He lyes buried in the
Church that is Dedicated to him at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
tho' it was formerly Conſecrated
to the Bleſſed Virgin. It is extreamly
magnificent, and very richly adorned.
There are narrow Clefts in the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that ſtands over him, where good
Catholicks rub their Beads, and ſmell
his Bones, which they ſay have in them
a natural Perfume, tho' very like Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectic
Balſom; and what would make
one ſuſpect that they rub the Marble
with it, it is obſerved that the Scent is
ſtronger in the Morning than at Night.
There are abundance of Inſcriptions and
Pictures hung up by his Votaries in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Parts of the Church: For it is the
way of thoſe that are in any Signal Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to implore his Aid, and if they come
off ſafe they call their Deliverance a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
and perhaps hang up the Picture
or Deſcription of it in the Church. This
Cuſtom ſpoils the Beauty of ſeveral <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Catholick Churches, and often co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the Walls with wretched Daub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
impertinent Inſcriptions, Hands,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0168900800:69"/>
Legs, and Arms of Wax, with a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
idle Offerings of the ſame Nature.</p>
            <p>They ſell at <hi>Padua</hi> the Life of St.
<hi>Anthony,</hi> which is read with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
the moſt remarkable Part of it
is his Diſcourſe to an Aſſembly of Fiſh.
As the Audience and Sermon are both
very extraordinary, I will ſet down the
whole Paſſage at length.<q>

                  <p>When the Hereticks would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
his Preaching, he betook himſelf
to the Sea-ſhore, where the River
<hi>Marecchia</hi> diſembogues it ſelf into the
Adriatic. He here called the Fiſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the Name of God, that
they might hear his Holy Word. The
Fiſh came ſwimming towards him in
ſuch vaſt Shoals, both from the Sea
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0168900800:73"/>
and from the River, that the Surface
of the Water was quite covered with
their Multitudes. They quickly ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
themſelves, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Species, into a very beautiful
Congregation, and, like ſo many ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Creatures, preſented themſelves
before him to hear the Word of God.
St. <hi>Antonio</hi> was ſo ſtruck with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Obedience and Submiſſion of
theſe poor Animals, that he found a
ſecret Sweetneſs diſtilling upon his

them in the following Words.</p>
                  <p>Altho' the Infinite Power and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God (my dearly beloved
Fiſh) diſcovers it ſelf in all the Works

Majeſty ſhines out in you more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,

you are comprehended under the
Name of <hi>Reptiles,</hi> partaking of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

dumb to Speech, and terrible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold:
Notwithſtanding, I ſay, theſe
natural Diſadvantages, the Divine
Greatneſs ſhows it ſelf in you after a
very wonderful manner. In you are
ſeen the mighty Myſteries of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Goodneſs. The Holy Scripture
has always made uſe of you, as the
Types and Shadows of ſome profound

                  <p>Do you think that, without a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
the firſt Preſent that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty

ye Fiſhes? Do you think that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Myſtery, among all Creatures
and Animals which were appointed for
Sacrifices, you only were excepted, O
ye Fiſhes? Do you think there was
nothing meant by our Saviour Chriſt,
that next to the Paſchal Lamb he
took ſo much Pleaſure in the Food of
you, O ye Fiſhes? Do you think it
was by meer Chance, that when the
Redeemer of the World was to pay a
Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he thought fit to
find it in the Mouth of a Fiſh? Theſe
are all of them ſo many Myſteries and
Sacraments, that oblige you in a more

It is from God, my beloved Fiſh,

ſuch magnificent Retirements as are not
to be met with in the Seats of Kings,
or in the Palaces of Princes: You have
the Water for your Dwelling, a clear
tranſparent Element, brighter than
Chryſtal; you can ſee from its deepeſt
Bottom every thing that paſſes on its

or of an <hi>Argus</hi>; you are guided by a
ſecret and unerring Principle, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in every thing that may be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to you, and avoiding every thing
that may be hurtful; you are carried
on by a hidden Inſtinct to preſerve

                  <p>The Colds of Winter, and the

Let the Earth abound in Fruits, or be

Concern in the Bloſſoms of Spring,
or in the Glowings of Summer, in

you cannot employ your Tongues in

not provided with Words to expreſs

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving often heard <hi>Venice</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
as one of the moſt
defenſible Cities in the
World, I took Care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
my ſelf of the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in which its Strength conſiſts. And
theſe I find are chiefly owing to its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
Situation; for it has neither
Rocks nor Fortifications near it, and yet
is, perhaps, the moſt impregnable Town
in <hi>Europe.</hi> It ſtands at leaſt Four Miles
from any part of the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> nor are
the Shallows that lye about it, ever
frozen hard enough to bring over an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
from the Land-ſide. The conſtant
Flux and Reflux of the Sea, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Mildneſs of the Climate, hindering
the Ice from gathering to any Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
which is an Advantage the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
want, when they have laid all
their Country under Water. On the
Side that is expoſed to the Adriatic, the
Entrance is ſo difficult to hit, that they
have marked it out with ſeveral Stakes
driven into the Ground, which they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0168900800:83"/>
would not fail to cut upon the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of an Enemy's Fleet. For this
Reaſon they have not fortified the little
Iſlands, that lye at the Entrance, to the
beſt Advantage, which might otherwiſe
very eaſily command all the Paſſes that
lead to the City from the Adriatic. Nor
could an ordinary Fleet, with Bomb-Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
hope to ſucceed againſt a Place that
has always in its Arſenal a conſiderable
Number of Gallies and Men of War rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to put to Sea on a very ſhort warning.
If we could therefore ſuppoſe them block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up on all ſides, by a Power too ſtrong for
them, both by Sea and Land, they would
be able to defend themſelves againſt every
thing but Famine; and this would not
be a little mitigated by the great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Fiſh that their Seas abound with,
and that may be taken up in the midſt
of their very Streets, which is ſuch a
natural Magazine as few other Places
can boaſt of.</p>
            <p>Our Voyage-Writers will needs have
this City in great Danger of being left,
within an Age or two, on the <hi>Terra
Firma</hi>; and repreſent it in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as if the Sea was inſenſibly ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from it, and retiring into its Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.
I asked ſeveral, and among the reſt
Father <hi>Coronelli,</hi> the State's Geographer,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0168900800:84"/>
of the Truth of this Particular, and they
all aſſured me that the Sea riſes as high
as ever, tho' the great Heaps of Dirt
it brings along with it are apt to
choak up the Shallows, but that they
are in no Danger of loſing the Benefit
of their Situation, ſo long as they are at
the Charge of removing theſe Banks of
Mud and Sand. One may ſee abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of them above the Surface of the
Water, ſcattered up and down like ſo
many little Iſlands, when the Tide is
low; and they are theſe that make the
Entrance for Ships difficult to ſuch as
are not uſed to them, for the deep Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
run between them, which the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
are at a great Expence to keep
free and open.</p>
            <p>This City ſtands very convenient for
Commerce. It has ſeveral Navigable
Rivers that run up into the Body of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi>
by which they might ſupply a great
many Countries with Fiſh and other
Commodities; not to mention their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
for the <hi>Levant,</hi> and each ſide
of the Adriatic. But, notwithſtanding
theſe Conveniencies, their Trade is far
from being in a flouriſhing Condition for
many Reaſons. The Duties are great that
are laid on Merchandiſes. Their Nobles
think it below their Quality to engage
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0168900800:85"/>
in Traffick. The Merchants who are
grown Rich, and able to manage great
Dealings, buy their Nobility, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
give over Trade. Their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
of Cloth, Glaſs and Silk, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
the beſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
by thoſe of other Countries. They
are tenacious of old Laws and Cuſtoms
to their great Prejudice, whereas a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Nation muſt be ſtill for new Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Expedients, as different Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
and Emergencies ariſe. The State
is at preſent very ſenſible of this Decay
in their Trade, and as a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi>
who is ſtill a Merchant, told me, they
will ſpeedily find out ſome Method to
redreſs it; poſſibly by making a free
Port, for they look with an Evil Eye
upon <hi>Leghorne,</hi> which draws to it moſt of
the Veſſels bound for <hi>Italy.</hi> They have
hitherto been ſo negligent in this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
that many think the Great Duke's
Gold has had no ſmall Influence in their
Councils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Venice</hi> has ſeveral Particulars which
are not to be found in other Cities, and
is therefore very entertaining to a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller.
It looks, at a diſtance, like a great
Town half floated by a Deluge. There
are Canals every where croſſing it, ſo
that one may go to moſt Houſes either
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0168900800:86"/>
by Land or Water. This is a very great
Convenience to the Inhabitants; for a
<hi>Gondola</hi> with Two Oars at <hi>Venice,</hi> is as
magnificent as a Coach and Six Horſes,
with a large Equipage, in another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
beſides that it makes all Carriages
extreamly cheap. The Streets are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Paved with Brick or Free-ſtone,
and always kept very neat, for there is
no Carriage, not ſo much as a Chair,
that paſſes thro' them. There is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Multitude of very handſome
Bridges, all of a ſingle Arch, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Fence on either ſide, which
would be a great Inconvenience to a
City leſs ſober than <hi>Venice.</hi> One would
indeed wonder that Drinking is ſo little
in Vogue among the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who are
in a moiſt Air and a moderate Climate,
and have no ſuch Diverſions as Bowling,
Hunting, Walking, Riding, and the
like Exerciſes to employ them without
Doors. But as the Nobles are not to
Converſe too much with Strangers, they
are in no Danger of learning it; and
they are generally too diſtruſtful of one
another for the Freedoms that are uſed
in ſuch kind of Converſations. There
are many Noble Palaces in <hi>Venice.</hi> Their
Furniture is not commonly very Rich,
if we except the Pictures, which are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0168900800:87"/>
here in greater plenty than in any other
Place in <hi>Europe,</hi> from the Hands of the
beſt Maſters of the <hi>Lombard</hi> School; as
<hi>Titian, Paul Veroneſe</hi> and <hi>Tintoret.</hi> The
laſt of theſe is in greater Eſteem at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
than in other Parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> The
Rooms are generally hung with Gilt
Leather, which they cover on extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Occaſions with Tapeſtry, and
Hangings of greater Value. The Floor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is a kind of Red Plaiſter made of
Brick ground to Powder, and afterwards
work'd into Mortar. It is rubbed with
Oil, and makes a ſmooth, ſhining and
beautiful Surface. Theſe Particularities
are chiefly owing to the Moiſture of the
Air, which would have an ill Effect on
other kinds of Furniture, as it ſhows it
ſelf too viſibly in many of their fineſt
Pictures. Tho' the <hi>Venetians</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
jealous of any great Fame or
Merit in a living Member of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
they never fail of giving a
Man his due Pariſes, when they are in
no Danger of ſuffering from his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For this Reaſon, tho' there are a
great many Monuments erected to ſuch
as have been Benefactors to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
they are generally put up after their
Deaths. Among the many Elogiums
that are given to the Doge <hi>Piſauro,</hi> who
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0168900800:88"/>
had been Ambaſſador in <hi>England,</hi> his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaph
ſays, <hi>In Angliâ Jacobi Regis obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
mirâ calliditate celatum mirâ ſagacita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
rimatus priſcam benevolentiam firmavit.</hi>
The particular Palaces, Churches, and
Pictures of <hi>Venice,</hi> are enumerated in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
little Books that may be bought on
the Place, and have been faithfully
Tranſcribed by many Voyage-Writers.
When I was at <hi>Venice,</hi> they were putting
out very curious Stamps of the ſeveral
Edifices which are moſt famous for their
Beauty or Magnificence. The <hi>Arſenal</hi>
of <hi>Venice</hi> is an Iſland of about three Miles
round. It contains all the Stores and
Proviſions for War, that are not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
employed. There are Docks for
their Gallies and Men of War, moſt of
them full, as well as Work-Houſes for
all Land and Naval Preparations. That
Part of it, where the Arms are laid,
makes a great ſhow, and was indeed very
extraordinary about a Hundred Years
ago, but at preſent a great part of its
Furniture is grown uſeleſs. There ſeem
to be almoſt as many Suits of Armour as
there are Guns. The Swords are old-faſhion'd
and unwieldy in a very great
Number, and the Fire-Arms fitted with
Locks of little Convenience in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of thoſe that are now in uſe. The
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0168900800:89"/>
               <hi>Venetians</hi> pretend they could ſet out, in
Caſe of great Neceſſity, Thirty Men of
War, a Hundred Gallies, and Ten Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſſes,
tho' I cannot conceive how they
could Man a Fleet of half the number.
It was certainly a mighty Error in this
State to affect ſo many Conqueſts on the
<hi>Terra Firma,</hi> which has only ſerved to
raiſe the Jealouſie of the Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and about Three Hundred Years
ago had like to have ended in the utter
Extirpation of the Common-wealth;
whereas, had they applyed themſelves
with the ſame Politics and Induſtry to
the Increaſe of their Strength by Sea,
they might perhaps have had all the
Iſlands of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> in their Hands,
and, by Conſequence, the greateſt Fleet,
and the moſt Sea-men of any other State
in <hi>Europe.</hi> Beſides, that this would have
given no Jealouſie to the Princes their
Neighbours, who would have enjoyed
their own Dominions in Peace, and
have been very well contented to have
ſeen ſo ſtrong a Bulwark againſt all the
Forces and Invaſions of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>This Republick has been much more
powerful than it is at preſent, as it is ſtill
likelier to ſink than increaſe in its Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is not impoſſible but the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0168900800:90"/>
may, ſome time or other, demand of them
<hi>Creme, Breſcia,</hi> and <hi>Bergame,</hi> which have
been torn from the <hi>Milaneſe</hi>; and in caſe
a War ſhould ariſe upon it, and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
loſe a ſingle Battel, they might
be beaten off the Continent in a ſingle
Summer, for their Fortifications are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Inconſiderable. On the other ſide,
the <hi>Venetians</hi> are in continual Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
from the <hi>Turk,</hi> who will certainly
endeavour at the Recovery of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi>
as ſoon as the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire has
recruited a little of its antient Strength.
They are very ſenſible that they had
better have puſhed their Conqueſts on
the other ſide of the Adriatick into <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania,</hi>
for then their Territories would
have lain together, and have been nearer
the Fourtain-Head to have received Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
on occaſions; but the <hi>Venetians</hi> are
under Articles with the Emperor, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
into his Hands whatever they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions, that has
been formerly diſmembered from the
Empire. And having already very much
diſſatisfied him in the <hi>Frioul</hi> and <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
they dare not think of exaſperating
him further. The Pope diſputes with
them their Pretenſions to the <hi>Poleſin,</hi> as
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> lays an equal Claim
to the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> 'Tis ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0168900800:91"/>
to conſider with what Heats theſe
Two Powers have conteſted their Title
to a Kingdom that is in the Hands of
the <hi>Turk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among all theſe Difficulties the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
will ſtill maintain it ſelf, if Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
can prevail upon Force; for it is
certain the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate is one of
the wiſeſt Councils in the World, tho'
at the ſame time, if we believe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of ſeveral that have been well
verſed in their Conſtitution, a great part
of their Politics is founded on Maxims
which others do not think conſiſtent with
their Honour to put in practice. The
Preſervation of the Republick is that to
which all other Conſiderations ſubmit.
To encourage Idleneſs and Luxury in
the Nobility, to cheriſh Ignorance and
Licentiouſneſs in the Clergy, to keep
alive a continual Faction in the Common
People, to connive at the Viciouſneſs
and Debauchery of Convents, to breed
Diſſenſions among the Nobles of the
<hi>Terra Firma,</hi> to treat a brave Man with
Scorn and Infamy: In ſhort, to ſtick at
nothing for the Publick Intereſt, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
as the refined Parts of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi>
Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Among all the Inſtances of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics,
there is none more admirable than
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0168900800:92"/>
the great Secrecy that reigns in their
Public Councils. The Senate is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
as numerous as our Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
if we only reckon the ſitting
Members, and yet carries its Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſo privately, that they are ſeldom
known 'till they diſcover themſelves in
the Execution. It is not many Years
ſince they had before them a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
concerning the Puniſhment of one
of their Admirals, which laſted a Month
together, and concluded in his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
yet was there none of his Friends,
nor of thoſe who had engaged warmly
in his Defence, that gave him the leaſt
Intimation of what was paſſing againſt
him, 'till he was actually ſeiz'd, and in
the Hands of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> think themſelves
equal at leaſt to the Electors of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and but one Degree below Kings;
for which reaſon they ſeldom travel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Foreign Countries, where they muſt
undergo the Mortification of being treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like private Gentlemen: Yet it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
of them, that they diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with a great deal of Dexterity in
ſuch Embaſſies and Treaties as are laid
on them by the Republick; for their
whole Lives are employed in Intrigues
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0168900800:93"/>
of State, and they naturally give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Airs of Kings and Princes, of
which the Miniſters of other Nations
are only the Repreſentatives. Monſieur
<hi>Amelot</hi> reckons in his Time, Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Five Hundred Nobles that had
Voices in the great Council, but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
I am told, there are not at moſt
Fifteen Hundred, notwithſtanding the
Addition of many new Families ſince
that time. It is very ſtrange, that with
this Advantage they are not able to keep
up their Number, conſidering that the
Nobility ſpreads equally thro' all the
Brothers, and that ſo very few of them
are deſtroyed by the Wars of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.
Whether this may be imputed
to the Luxury of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> or to
the ordinary Celibacy of the younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or to the laſt Plague which ſwept
away many of them, I know not. They
generally thruſt the Females of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
into Convents, the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their Eſtates. This makes the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi>
Nuns famous for the Liberties they
allow themſelves. They have Opera's
within their own Walls, and often go
out of their Bounds to meet their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers,
or they are very much miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.
They have many of them their
Lovers, that converſe with them daily at
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0168900800:94"/>
the Grate, and are very free to admit a
Viſit from a Stranger. There is indeed
one of the <hi>Cornara's,</hi> that not long ago
refuſed to ſee any under a Prince.</p>
            <p>The Carnaval of <hi>Venice</hi> is every where
talked of. The great Diverſion of the place
at that Time, as well as on all other high
Occaſions, is Masking. The <hi>Venetians,</hi>
who are naturally Grave, love to give into
the Follies and Entertainments of ſuch Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
when diſguiſed in a falſe Perſonage.
They are indeed under a neceſſity of
finding out Diverſions that may agree
with the Nature of the Place, and make
ſome Amends for the Loſs of ſeveral Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
which may be met with on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.
Theſe Diſguiſes give Occaſion
to abundance of Love Adventures; for
there is ſomething more intriguing in the
Amours of <hi>Venice,</hi> than in thoſe of other
Countries, and I queſtion not but the
Secret Hiſtory of a Carnaval would make
a Collection of very diverting Novels.
Opera's are another great Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Seaſon. The Poetry of them
is generally as exquiſitely ill, as the
Muſick is good. The Arguments are
often taken from ſome celebrated Action
of the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> which
ſometimes looks ridiculous enough; for
who can endure to hear one of the rough
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0168900800:95"/>
old <hi>Romans</hi> ſqueaking thro' the Mouth
of an Eunuch, eſpecially when they may
chuſe a Subject out of Courts where Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs
are really Actors, or repreſent by
them any of the ſoft <hi>Aſiatic</hi> Monarchs?
The Opera that was moſt in Vogue,
during my Stay at <hi>Venice,</hi> was built on
the following Subject. <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi>
are Rivals for <hi>Cato</hi>'s Daughter. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s
firſt Words bid his Soldiers fly, for
the Enemies are upon them. <hi>Si Leva
Ceſare, e dice a Soldati. A la fugga. A'
lo Scampo.</hi> The Daughter gives the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which is made the
Occaſion of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Death. Before he
kills himſelf, you ſee him withdrawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Library, where, among his Books,
I obſerved the Titles of <hi>Plutarch</hi> and
<hi>Taſſo.</hi> After a ſhort Soliloquy he ſtrikes
himſelf with the Dagger that he holds
in his Hand, but, being interrupted by
one of his Friends, he ſtabs him for his
Pains, and by the Violence of the Blow
unluckily breaks the Dagger on one of
his Ribs, ſo that he is forced to diſpatch
himſelf by tearing up his firſt Wound.
This laſt Circumſtance puts me in Mind
of a Contrivance in the Opera of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi>
that was acted at the ſame time.
The King of the Play endeavours at a
Rape, but the Poet being reſolved to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0168900800:96"/>
ſave his Heroine's Honour, has ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it, that the King always acts with
a great Caſe-Knife ſtuck in his Girdle,
which the Lady ſnatches from him in
the Struggle, and ſo defends her ſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> Poets, beſides the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Smoothneſs of their Tongue, have
a particular Advantage, above the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of other Nations, in the difference
of their Poetical and Proſe Language.
There are indeed Sets of Phraſes that in
all Countries are peculiar to the Poets,
but among the <hi>Italians</hi> there are not only
Sentences, but a Multitude of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Words that never enter into common
Diſcourſe. They have ſuch a different
Turn and Poliſhing for Poetical Uſe, that
they drop ſeveral of their Letters, and
appear in another Form, when they
come to be ranged in Verſe. For this
Reaſon the <hi>Italian</hi> Opera ſeldom ſinks
into a Poorneſs of Language, but, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt
all the Meanneſs and Familiarity
of the Thoughts, has ſomething beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and ſonorous in the Expreſſion.
Without this natural Advantage of the
Tongue, their preſent Poetry would
appear wretchedly low and vulgar, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the many ſtrained Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that are ſo much in uſe among the
Writers of this Nation. The <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0168900800:97"/>
and <hi>French,</hi> who always uſe the ſame
Words in Verſe as in ordinary Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
are forced to raiſe their Language
with Metaphors and Figures, or, by
the Pompouſneſs of the whole Phraſe,
to wear off any Littleneſs that appears
in the particular Parts that compoſe it.
This makes our Blank Verſe, where
there is no Rhime to ſupport the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
extreamly difficult to ſuch as
are not Maſters in the Tongue, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when they write on low Subjects;
and 'tis probably for this Reaſon that
<hi>Milton</hi> has made uſe of ſuch frequent
Tranſpoſitions, Latiniſms, antiquated
Words and Phraſes, that he might the
better deviate from vulgar and ordinary
Expreſſions.</p>
            <p>The Comedies that I ſaw at <hi>Venice,</hi>
or indeed in any other Part of <hi>Italy,</hi> are
very indifferent, and more lewd than
thoſe of other Countries. Their Poets
have no Notion of gentile Comedy, and
fall into the moſt filthy double Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
imaginable, when they have a Mind
to make their Audience merry. There
is no Part generally ſo wretched as that
of the fine Gentleman, eſpecially when
he Converſes with his Miſtreſs; for then
the whole Dialogue is an inſipid mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Pedantry and Romance. But
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0168900800:98"/>
'tis no wonder that the Poets of ſo Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and Reſerved a Nation fail in ſuch
Converſations on the Stage, as they have
no Patterns of in Nature. There are
Four Standing Characters which enter
into every Piece that comes on the Stage,
the <hi>Doctor, Harlequin, Pantalone</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viello.</hi>
The <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Character com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the whole Extent of a Pedant,
that with a deep Voice, and a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
Air breaks in upon Converſation,
and drives down all before him: Every
thing he ſays is backed with Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of <hi>Galen, Hippocrates, Plato, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi>
or any Author that riſes uppermoſt,
aad all Anſwers from his Companion are
looked upon as Impertinencies or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.
<hi>Harlequin</hi>'s Part is made up
of Blunders and Abſurdities: He is to
miſtake one Name for another, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his Errands, to ſtumble over Queens,
and to run his Head againſt every Poſt
that ſtands in his way. This is all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with ſomething ſo Comical in
the Voice and Geſtures, that a Man,
who is ſenſible of the Folly of the Part,
can hardly forbear being pleaſed with it.
<hi>Pantalone</hi> is generally an old Cully, and
<hi>Coviello</hi> a Sharper.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen a Tranſlation of the <hi>Cid</hi>
acted at <hi>Bolonia,</hi> which would never
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0168900800:99"/>
have taken, had they not found a Place
in it for theſe Buffoons. All Four of
them appear in Masks that are made
like the old <hi>Roman Perſonae,</hi> as I ſhall
have occaſion to obſerve in another
Place. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> have
probably derived this Cuſtom of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome of their Characters in Masks,
from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Theater. The
old <hi>Vatican Terence</hi> has at the Head of
every Scene the Figures of all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that are concerned in it, with the
particular Diſguiſes in which they acted;
and I remember to have ſeen in the <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
Mattheio</hi> an Antick Statue mask'd,
which was perhaps deſigned for <hi>Gnatho</hi>
in the Eunuch, for it agrees exactly
with the Figure he makes in the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
Manuſcript. One would wonder
indeed how ſo Polite a People, as the
ancient <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Athenians,</hi> ſhould
not look on theſe borrowed Faces as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.
They might do very well for
a Cyclops, or a Satyr, that can have no
Reſemblance in Human Features; but
for a Flatterer, a Miſer, or the like Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
which abound in our own Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
nothing is more ridiculous than to
repreſent their Looks by a painted Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.
In Perſons of this Nature the
Turns and Motions of the Face are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0168900800:100"/>
as agreeable as any part of the Action.
Could we ſuppoſe that a Mask repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
never ſo naturally the general Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of a Character, it can never ſuit
with the Variety of Paſſions that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to every ſingle Perſon in the whole
Courſe of a Play. The Grimace may
be proper on ſome Occaſions, but is too
ſteady to agree with all. The Rabble
indeed are generally pleaſed at the firſt
Entry of a Diſguiſe, but the Jeſt grows
cold even with them too when it comes
on the Stage in a Second Scene.</p>
            <p>Since I am on this Subject, I cannot
forbear mentioning a Cuſtom at <hi>Venice,</hi>
which they tell me is particular to the
common People of this Country, of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stanza's out of <hi>Taſſo.</hi> They are ſet
to a pretty Solemn Tune, and when one
begins in any part of the Poet, it is odds
but he will be anſwered by ſome Body
elſe that over-hears him: So that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
you have Ten or a Dozen in the
Neighbourhood of one another, taking
Verſe after Verſe, and running on with
the Poem as far as their Memories will
carry them.</p>
            <p>On Holy-<hi>Thurſday,</hi> among the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Shows that are yearly exhibited, I
ſaw one that is odd enough, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> There is a Set
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0168900800:101"/>
of Artiſans, who by the help of ſeveral
Poles, which they lay acroſs each others
Shoulders, build themſelves up into a
kind of Pyramid; ſo that you ſee a
Pile of Men in the Air of Four or Five
Rows riſing one above another. The
Weight is ſo equally diſtributed, that
every Man is very well able to bear his part
of it, the Stories, if I may ſo call them,
growing leſs and leſs as they advance high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and higher. A little Boy repreſents the
Point of the Pyramid, who, after a
ſhort ſpace, leaps off, with a great deal
of Dexterity, into the Arms of one that
catches him at the Bottom. In the ſame
manner the whole Building falls to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
I have been the more particular on
this, becauſe it explains the following
Verſes of <hi>Claudian,</hi> which ſhow that the
<hi>Venetians</hi> are not the Inventors of this
Trick.<q>

            <p>I came down a Branch of the <hi>Po,</hi> as
far as <hi>Alberto,</hi> within Ten Miles of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna.</hi>
All this Space lyes miſerably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated

where the Soil is made extreamly fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and ſhows that much of the reſt

manage it to the beſt Advantage. It is
now on both ſides the Road very Marſhy,
and generally over-grown with Ruſhes,
which made me fancy it was once float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Sea, that lyes within Four
Miles of it. Nor could I in the leaſt

            <p>Accordingly the old Geographers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
it as ſituated among Marſhes and
Shallows. The Place which is ſhown
for the Haven, is on a Level with the
Town, and has probably been ſtopped
up by the great Heaps of Dirt that the Sea
has thrown into it; for all the Soil on
that ſide of <hi>Ravenna</hi> has been left there
inſenſibly by the Sea's diſcharging it ſelf
upon it for ſo many Ages. The Ground
muſt have been formerly much lower,
for otherwiſe the Town would have
lain under Water. The Remains of the
<hi>Pharos,</hi> that ſtand about Three Miles
from the Sea, and Two from the Town,
have their Foundations covered with
Earth for ſome Yards, as they told me,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0168900800:111"/>
which notwithſtanding are upon a Level
with the Fields that lye about them,
tho' 'tis probable they took the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a riſing Ground to ſet it upon.
It was a ſquare Tower of about Twelve
Yards in Breadth, as appears by that
part of it which yet remains entire, ſo
that its Height muſt have been very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
to have preſerved a Proportion.

            <p>On the ſide of the Town, where the

there is now a little Church called the
<hi>Rotonda.</hi> At the Entrance of it are Two
Stones, the one with an Inſcription in
<hi>Gothic</hi> Characters, that has nothing in
it remarkable; the other is a ſquare
Piece of Marble, that by the Inſcription
appears ancient, and by the Ornaments
about it ſhows it ſelf to have been a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Pagan Monument of Two Perſons
who were Shipwreck'd, perhaps in the

            <p>There is a Turn in the Third Verſe
that we loſe, by not knowing the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of their Story. It was the
<hi>Naufraga mors</hi> which deſtroyed them,
as it had formerly united them; what
this Union was is expreſſed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Verſe, by their both having been
made Free-men on the ſame Day. If
therefore we ſuppoſe they had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
Shipwreck'd with their Maſter,
and that he made them Free at the ſame
time, the <hi>Epigram</hi> is unriddled. Nor is
this Interpretation perhaps ſo forc'd as
it may ſeem at firſt ſight, ſince it was
the Cuſtom of the Maſters, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Death, to give their Slaves
their Freedom, if they had deſerv'd it at
their Hands; and it is natural enough
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0168900800:113"/>
to ſuppoſe one, involved in a common
Shipwreck, would give ſuch of his Slaves
their Liberty, as ſhould have the good
Luck to ſave themſelves. The Chancel
of this Church is vaulted with a ſingle
Stone of Four Foot in Thickneſs, and
a Hundred and Fourteen in Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
There ſtood on the Outſide of
this little Cupola a great Tomb of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry,</hi>
and the Statues of the Twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;
but in the War that <hi>Louis</hi> the
Twelfth made on <hi>Italy,</hi> the Tomb was
broken in pieces by a Cannon-Ball.
It was, perhaps, the ſame Blow that
made the Flaw in the Cupola, tho' the
Inhabitants ſay it was crack'd by Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that deſtroyed a Son of one of their
<hi>Gothic</hi> Princes, who had taken Shelter
under it, as having been foretold what
kind of Death he was to die. I asked an
Abbot, that was in the Church, what
was the Name of this <hi>Gothic</hi> Prince, who,
after a little Recollection, anſwered me,
That he could not tell preciſely, but
that he thought it was one <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi>
There is a Convent of <hi>Theatins,</hi> where
they ſhow a little Window in the
Church, thro' which the Holy Ghoſt
is ſaid to have entered in the Shape of
a Dove, and to have ſettled on one of
the Candidates for the Biſhoprick. The
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0168900800:114"/>
Dove is repreſented in the Window, and
in ſeveral Places of the Church, and is
in great Reputation all over <hi>Italy.</hi> I ſhould
not indeed think it impoſſible for a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
to fly in accidentally thro' the Roof,
where they ſtill keep the Hole open,
and by its fluttering over ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Place, to give ſo ſuperſtitious
an Aſſembly an Occaſion of favouring a
Competitor, eſpecially if he had many
Friends among the Electors that would
make a politick Uſe of ſuch an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
But they pretend the Miracle has
happened more than once. Among the
Pictures of ſeveral famous Men of their
Order, there is one with this Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

The Statue of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
ſtands in the large Square of the
Town; it is caſt in Braſs, and has the
Poſture that is always given the Figure
of a Pope; an Arm extended, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the People. In another Square on
a high Pillar is ſet the Statue of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Virgin, arrayed like a Queen, with
a Scepter in her Hand, and a Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Head; for having delivered the
Town from a raging Peſtilence. The
Cuſtom of Crowning the Holy Virgin
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0168900800:115"/>
is ſo much in Vogue among the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>

a little Tinſel Crown, or perhaps a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

the Head of the Figure, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſpoils a good Picture. In the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

<hi>Gruter.</hi> A Triumphal Arch raiſed by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi>
which makes a Noble Gate to the
Town, tho' part of it is ruined. The
Ruins of an Amphitheater. The <hi>Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtum,</hi>
on which it is ſaid that <hi>Julius
Caeſar</hi> harangued his Army after having
paſſed the <hi>Rubicon.</hi> I muſt confeſs I can
by no means look on this laſt as Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick:
It is built of hewn Stone, like the
Pedeſtal of a Pillar, but ſomething high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than ordinary, and is but juſt broad
enough for one Man to ſtand upon it.
On the contrary, the ancient <hi>Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtums,</hi>
as I have often obſerved on Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0168900800:117"/>
as well as on <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Arch,
were made of Wood like a little kind of
Stage, for the Heads of the Nails are
ſometimes repreſented, that are ſuppoſed
to have faſtened the Boards together. We
often ſee on them the Emperor, and
Two or Three General Officers, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſitting and ſometimes ſtanding, as
they made Speeches, or diſtributed a
Congiary to the Soldiers or People.
They were probably always in readineſs,
and carried among the Baggage of the
Army, whereas this at <hi>Rimini</hi> muſt have
been built on the Place, and required
ſome time before it could be finiſhed.</p>

I could not forbear viſiting, tho' it lyes
out of the common Tour of Travellers,

ſhall here give a particular Account of
it, becauſe I know of no Body elſe that

the Pleaſure of ſeeing in it ſomething
more ſingular than can be found in great
Governments, and form from it an Idea
of <hi>Venico</hi> in its firſt Beginnings, when it
had only a few Heaps of Earth for its

            <head>THE
REPUBLICK
OF
St. MARINO.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Town and Republick of
St. <hi>Marino</hi> ſtands on the Top
of a very high and craggy
Mountain. It is generally
hid among the Clouds, and
lay under Snow when I ſaw it, tho' it
was clear and warm Weather in all the
Country about it. There is not a Spring
or Fountain, that I could hear of, in the
whole Dominions, but they are always
well provided with huge Ciſterns and
Reſervoirs of Rain and Snow-Water.
The Wine that grows on the ſides of
their Mountain is extraordinary good,
and I think much better than any I met
with on the cold ſide of the <hi>Appenines.</hi>
This puts me in Mind of their Cellars,
which have moſt of 'em a natural Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that renders 'em extreamly cool
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0168900800:121"/>
in the hotteſt Seaſons, for they have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
in the Sides of them deep Holes
that run into the Hollows of the Hill,
from whence there conſtantly iſſues a
breathing kind of Vapour, ſo very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the Summer time, that a Man
can ſcarce ſuffer his Hand in the Wind of
it.</p>
            <p>This Mountain, and a few neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Hillocks that lye ſcatter'd about the
Bottom of it, is the whole Circuit of
theſe Dominions. They have, what
they call, Three Caſtles, Three Convents,
and Five Churches, and can reckon about
Five Thouſand Souls in their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Inhabitants as well as the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who mention this little Republick,
give the following Account of its Original.
St. <hi>Marino</hi> was its Founder, a <hi>Dalmatian</hi>
by Birth, and by Trade a Maſon. He
was employed above Thirteen Hundred
Years ago in the Reparation of <hi>Rimini,</hi>
and, after he had finiſh'd his Work,
retired to this ſolitary Mountain, as find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it very proper for the Life of a Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
which he led in the greateſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours
and Auſterities of Religion. He
had not been long here before he wrought
a reputed Miracle, which, join'd with
his extraordinary Sanctity, gained him
ſo great an Eſteem, that the Princeſs of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0168900800:122"/>
the Country made him a Preſent of the
Mountain to diſpoſe of it at his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion.
His Reputation quickly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
it, and gave Riſe to the Republick
which calls it ſelf after his Name. So that
the Common-wealth of <hi>Marino</hi> may boaſt
at leaſt of a nobler Original than that of
<hi>Rome,</hi> the one having been at firſt an
<hi>Aſylum</hi> for Robbers and Murderers, and
the other a Reſort of Perſons eminent for
their Piety and Devotion. The beſt of
their Churches is Dedicated to the Saint,
and holds his Aſhes. His Statue ſtands
over the high Altar, with the Figure of
a Mountain in its Hands, crown'd with
Three Caſtles, which is likewiſe the
Arms of the Common-wealth. They at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to his Protection the long Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their State, and look on him as
the greateſt Saint next the Bleſſed Virgin.
I ſaw in their Statute-Book a Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch as ſpeak diſreſpectfully of him,
who are to be puniſhed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as thoſe who are Convicted of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</p>
            <p>This petty Republick has now laſted
Thirteen hundred Years, while all the
other States of <hi>Italy</hi> have ſeveral times
changed their Maſters and Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Their whole Hiſtory is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
in Two Purchaſes, which they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0168900800:123"/>
made of a neighbouring Prince, and in
a War in which they aſſiſted the Pope
againſt a Lord of <hi>Rimini.</hi> In the Year
1100 they bought a Caſtle in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
as they did another in the
Year 1170. The Papers of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are preſerv'd in their Archives,
where 'tis very remarkable that the
Name of the Agent for the Common-wealth,
of the Seller, of the Notary,
and the Witneſſes, are the ſame in both
the Inſtruments, tho' drawn up at Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years diſtance from each other. Nor
can it be any Miſtake in the Date, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Popes and Emperors Names,
with the Year of their reſpective Reigns,
are both punctually ſet down. About
290 Years after this they aſſiſted Pope
<hi>Pius</hi> the Second againſt one of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateſta's,</hi>
who was then Lord of <hi>Rimini</hi>;
and when they had helped to conquer
him, received from the Pope, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for their Aſſiſtance, Four little Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
This they repreſent as the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
Time of the Common-wealth,
when their Dominions reach'd half way
up a neighbouring Hill; but at preſent
they are reduced to their old Extent.
They would probably ſell their Liberty
as dear as they could to any that attacked
them; for there is but one Road by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0168900800:124"/>
which to climb up to them, and they
have a very ſevere Law againſt any of
their own Body that enters the Town
by another Path, leſt any new one
ſhould be worn on the Sides of their
Mountain. All that are capable of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arms are exercis'd, and ready at a
Moment's Call.</p>
            <p>The Sovereign Power of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
was lodg'd originally in what they
call the <hi>Arengo,</hi> a great Council in which
every Houſe had its Repreſentative. But
becauſe they found too much Confuſion
in ſuch a Multitude of Stateſmen, they
devolv'd their whole Authority into the
Hands of the Council of Sixty. The
<hi>Arengo</hi> however is ſtill called together
in Caſes of extraordinary Importance;
and if, after due Summons, any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
abſents himſelf, he is to be Fin'd to
the value of about a Penny <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which
the Statute ſays he ſhall pay, <hi>Sine ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quâ
diminutione aut gratiâ.</hi> In the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Courſe of Government, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Sixty (which, notwithſtanding
the Name; conſiſts but of Forty Perſons)
has in its Hands the Adminiſtration of
Affairs, and is made up half out of the
Noble Families, and half out of the
<hi>Plebeian.</hi> They decide all by Baloting,
are not admitted 'till Five and Twenty
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0168900800:125"/>
Years old, and chuſe the Officers of the
Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Thus far they agree with the Great

much more extended; for no Sentence
can ſtand that is not confirmed by Two
Thirds of this Council. Beſides, that
no Son can be admitted into it during
the Life of his Father, nor Two be in it of
the ſame Family, nor any enter but by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.
The chief Officers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
are the Two <hi>Capitaneos,</hi> who
have ſuch a Power as the old <hi>Roman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls
had, but are choſen every Six Months.
I talk'd with ſome that had been <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneos</hi>
Six or Seven times, tho' the Office
is never to be continu'd to the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
twice ſucceſſively. The Third Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
is the Commiſſary, who judges in
all Civil and Criminal Matters. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the many Alliances, Friendſhips,
and Intermarriages, as well as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Feuds and Animoſities that happen
among ſo ſmall a People might obſtruct
the Courſe of Juſtice, if one of their
own Number had the Diſtribution of it;
they have always a Foreigner for this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,
whom they chuſe for Three Years,
and maintain out of the Publick Stock.
He muſt be a Doctor of Law, and a
Man of known Integrity. He is join'd
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0168900800:126"/>
in Commiſſion with the <hi>Capitaneos,</hi> and
acts ſomething like the Recorder of
<hi>London</hi> under the Lord Mayor. The
Common-wealth of <hi>Genoa</hi> was forc'd to
make uſe of a foreign Judge for many
Years, whilſt their Republick was torn
into the Diviſions of <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines.</hi>
The Fourth Man in the State is
the Phyſician, who muſt likewiſe be a
Stranger, and is maintain'd by a publick
Salary. He is oblig'd to keep a Horſe,
to viſit the Sick, and to inſpect all
Drugs that are imported. He muſt be
at leaſt Thirty Five Years old, a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of the Faculty, and eminent for
his Religion and Honeſty; that his Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Ignorance may not unpeople the
Common-wealth. And that they may
not ſuffer long under any bad Choice, he
is elected only for Three Years. The
preſent Phyſician is a very underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man, and well read in our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<hi>Harvey, Willis, Sydenham,</hi> &amp;c.
He has been continu'd for ſome time
among 'em, and they ſay the Common-wealth
thrives under his Hands. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perſon, who makes no ordinary Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
in the Republick, is the School-Maſter.
I ſcarce met with any in the
Place that had not ſome Tincture of
Learning. I had the Peruſal of a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0168900800:127"/>

The Chapter on the publick
Miniſters ſays, that when an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
is diſpatch'd from the Republick to
any Foreign State he ſhall be allow'd,
out of the Treaſury, to the Value of a
Shilling a Day. The People are eſteem'd
very honeſt and rigorous in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Juſtice, and ſeem to live more
happy and contented among their Rocks
and Snows, than others of the <hi>Italians</hi>
do in the pleaſanteſt Vallies of the
World. Nothing indeed can be a
greater Inſtance of the natural Love
that Mankind has for Liberty, and of
their Averſion to an Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than ſuch a Savage Mountain co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd

               <hi>Fano, Senigallia</hi> and <hi>Ancona.
Fano</hi> received its Name from
the Fane or Temple of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that ſtood in it. One may ſtill ſee
the Triumphal Arch erected there to
<hi>Auguſtus</hi>: It is indeed very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
by Time, but the Plan of it, as it
ſtood entire with all its Inſcriptions, is
neatly cut upon the Wall of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Building. In each of theſe
Towns is a beautiful Marble Fountain,
where the Water runs continually thro'
ſeveral little Spouts, which looks very
refreſhing in theſe hot Countries, and
gives a great Coolneſs to the Air about
them. That of <hi>Peſaro</hi> is handſomly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.
<hi>Ancona</hi> is much the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0168900800:129"/>
of theſe Towns. It ſtands on
a Promontory, and looks more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
at a diſtance than when you are in
it. The Port was made by <hi>Trajan,</hi>
for which he has a Triumphal Arch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to him by the Sea-ſide. The
Marble of this Arch looks very white
and freſh, as being expoſed to the Winds
and Salt Sea-Vapours, that by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
fretting it preſeves it ſelf from that
mouldy Colour, which others of the
ſame Materials have contracted. Tho'
the <hi>Italians</hi> and Voyage-Writers call
theſe of <hi>Rimini, Fano,</hi> and <hi>Ancona</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal
Arches, there was probably
ſome Diſtinction made among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
between ſuch Honorary Arches e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to Emperors, and thoſe that
were rais'd to them on the Account of
a Victory, which are properly Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
Arches. This at <hi>Ancona</hi> was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Gratitude to <hi>Trajan</hi> for the
Port he had made there, as the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
I have mention'd were probably
for ſome Reaſon of the ſame Nature.
One may however obſerve the Wiſdom
of the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> who to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
their Emperors in their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of doing good to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
gave the ſame Honours to the great
Actions of Peace, which turn'd to the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0168900800:130"/>
Advantage of the Publick, as to thoſe
of War. This is very remarkable in the
Medals that were ſtamp'd on the ſame

one of <hi>Galba</hi>'s with a Triumphal Arch
on the Reverſe, that was made by the
Senate's Order for his having remitted
a Tax. <hi>R. XXXX. REMISSA. S. C.</hi>
The Medal which was made for <hi>Trajan</hi>
in Remembrance of his Benificence to
<hi>Ancona</hi> is very common. The Reverſe

The Riches in the Holy Houſe and
Treaſury are ſurprizingly great, and as
much ſurpaſs'd my Expectation as other
Sights have generally fallen ſhort of it.
Silver can ſcarce find an Admiſſion, and
Gold it ſelf looks but poorly among ſuch
an incredible number of precious Stones.
There will be, in a few Ages more, the
Jewels of the greateſt Value in <hi>Europe,</hi>
if the Devotion of its Princes continues
in its preſent Fervour. The laſt Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was made by the Queen Dowager
of <hi>Poland,</hi> and coſt her 18000 Crowns.
Some have wonder'd that the <hi>Turk</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
attacks this Treaſury, ſince it lyes
ſo near the Sea-ſhore, and is ſo weakly
guarded. But beſides that he has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
it formerly with no Succeſs, it
is certain the <hi>Venetians</hi> keep too watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
an Eye over his Motions at preſent,
and would never ſuffer him to enter the
Adriatic. It would indeed be an eaſie
thing for a Chriſtian Prince to ſurprize
it, who has Ships ſtill paſſing to and fro
without Suſpicion, eſpecially if he had
a Party in the Town, diſguis'd like Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims,
to ſecure a Gate for him; for
there have been ſometimes to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 100000 in a Day's time, as it is
generally reported. But 'tis probable
the Veneration for the Holy Houſe, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0168900800:133"/>
the Horror of an Action that would be
reſented by all the Catholick Princes of
<hi>Europe,</hi> will be as great a Security to the
Place as the ſtrongeſt Fortification. It
is indeed an amazing thing to ſee ſuch a
prodigious Quantity of Riches lye dead,
and untouch'd in the midſt of ſo much
Poverty and Miſery as reign on all ſides
of 'em. There is no queſtion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
but the Pope would make uſe of
theſe Treaſures in caſe of any great Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
that ſhould endanger the Holy See;
as an unfortunate War with the <hi>Turk,</hi> or a
powerful League among the Proteſtants.
For I can't but look on thoſe vaſt Heaps
of Wealth, that are amaſs'd together in
ſo many Religious Places of <hi>Italy,</hi> as the
hidden Reſerves and Magazines of the
Church, that ſhe would open on any
preſſing Occaſion for her laſt Defence
and Preſervation. If theſe Riches were
all turn'd into current Coin, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in Commerce, they would make
<hi>Italy</hi> the moſt flouriſhing Country in
<hi>Europe.</hi> The Caſe of the Holy Houſe
is nobly deſign'd, and executed by the
great Maſters of <hi>Italy,</hi> that flouriſh'd
about a hundred Years ago. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the <hi>Sibyls</hi> are very finely wrought,
each of 'em in a different Air and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
as are likewiſe thoſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0168900800:134"/>
underneath 'em. The Roof of
the Treaſury is painted with the ſame
kind of Device. There ſtands at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
End of it a large Crucifix very much
eſteem'd, the Figure of our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
him in his laſt Agonies of Death,
and amidſt all the Ghaſtlineſs of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
has ſomething in it very amiable.
The Gates of the Church are ſaid to be
of <hi>Corinthian</hi> Braſs, with many Scripture
Stories riſing on 'em in <hi>Baſſo Relievo.</hi>
The Pope's Statue, and the Fountain
by it, would make a noble Show in a
Place leſs beautified with ſo many other
Productions of Art. The Spicery, the
Cellar and its Furniture, the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of the Convent, with the Story
of the Holy Houſe, are too well known
to be here inſiſted upon.</p>
            <p>Whoever were the firſt Inventors of
this Impoſture, they ſeem to have taken
the hint of it from the Veneration that
the old <hi>Romans</hi> paid to the Cottage of
<hi>Romulus,</hi> which ſtood on Mount <hi>Capitol,</hi>
and was repair'd from time to time as
it fell to decay. <hi>Virgil</hi> has given a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Image of this little thatch'd Palace,
that repreſents it ſtanding in <hi>Manlius</hi>'s
Time, 327 Years after the Death of
<hi>Romulus.</hi>

The moſt remarkable is an Aquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of a <hi>Gothic</hi> Structure, that conveys

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0168900800:136"/>
drink of it. The Inhabitants of that
Country have ſtill the ſame Opinion of
it, as I found upon Enquiry, and have
a great many Oxen of a whitiſh Colour
to confirm 'em in it. It is probable this
Breed was firſt ſettled in the Country,
and continuing ſtill the ſame Species,
has made the Inhabitants impute it to a
wrong Cauſe; tho' they may as well
fancy their Hogs turn black for ſome
Reaſon of the ſame Nature, becauſe there
are none in <hi>Italy</hi> of any other Breed.

at which time it was order'd that his
Name and Conſulate ſhould be effaced
out of all publick Regiſters and Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
It is not therefore improbable,
that it was this long Name which fill'd
up the Gap I am now mentioning.
There are near this Monument the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins
of an ancient Theatre, with ſome of
the Caves entire. I ſaw among the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0168900800:140"/>
an old Heathen Altar, with this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity
in it, that it is hollow'd, like
a Diſh, at one End; but it was not this
End on which the Sacrifice was laid,
as one may gueſs from the Make of the
Feſtoon, that runs round the Altar,
and is inverted when the Hollow
ſtands uppermoſt. In the ſame Yard,
among the Rubbiſh of the Theatre, lye
Two Pillars, the one of Granate, and
the other of a very beautiful Marble.
I went out of my way to ſee the Famous
<hi>Caſcade</hi> about Three Miles from <hi>Terni.</hi>
It it form'd by the Fall of the River
<hi>Velino,</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi> mentions in the
Seventh <hi>Aeneid—Roſed rura Velini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Channel of this River lyes very
high, and is ſhaded on all ſides by a Green
Foreſt, made up of ſeveral kinds of Trees
that preſerve their Verdure all the Year.
The neighbouring Mountains are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with them, and by reaſon of their
height are more expos'd to the Dews and
drizzling Rains than any of the adjacent
Parts, which gives occaſion to <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea
rura,</hi> (Dewy Countries.) The River
runs extreamly rapid before its Fall, and
ruſhes down a Precipice of a Hundred
Yards high. It throws it ſelf into the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of a Rock, which has probably been
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0168900800:141"/>
worn by ſuch a conſtant Fall of Water.
It is impoſſible to ſee the Bottom on
which it breaks for the Thickneſs of the
Miſt that riſes from it, which looks at
a Diſtance like Clouds of Smoak aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
from ſome vaſt Furnace, and
diſtils in perpetual Rains on all the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that lye near it. I think there is
ſomething more aſtoniſhing in this <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade,</hi>
than in all the Water-Works of
<hi>Verſailles,</hi> and could not but wonder
when I firſt ſaw it, that I had never
met with it in any of the old Poets,
eſpecially in <hi>Claudian,</hi> who makes his
Emperor <hi>Honorius.</hi> go out of his way to
ſee the River <hi>Nar</hi> which runs juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, and yet does not mention what
would have been ſo great an Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his Poem. But at preſent I don't
in the leaſt queſtion, notwithſtanding
the Opinion of ſome Learned Men to
the contrary, that this is the Gulf thro'
which <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Alecto</hi> ſhoots her ſelf into
Hell: for the very Place, the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of it, the Fall of Waters, the
Woods that encompaſs it, with the
Smoak and Noiſe that ariſe from it,
are all pointed at in the Deſcription. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he would not mention the Name
of the River, becauſe he has done it in
the Verſes that precede. We may add
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0168900800:142"/>
to this, that the <hi>Caſcade</hi> is not far off
that part of <hi>Italy</hi> which has been call'd

From this River our next Town on the

ſaw hereabouts nothing remarkable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Bridge, that ſtands half
a Mile from the Town, and is one of
the ſtatelieſt Ruins in <hi>Italy.</hi> It has no
Cement, and looks as firm as one entire
Stone. There is an Arch of it unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the broadeſt that I have ever ſeen,
tho' by reaſon of its great height it does
not appear ſo. The middle one was ſtill
much broader. They join together
Two Mountains, and belong'd, without
doubt, to the Bridge that <hi>Martial</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
tho' Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> takes 'em to be the
Remains of an ancient Aquaeduct.<q>

            <p>From <hi>Narni</hi> I went to <hi>Otricoli,</hi> a very

the Caſtle of <hi>Ocriculum</hi> did formerly. I
turn'd about half a Mile out of the Road
to ſee the Ruins of the old <hi>Ocriculum,</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0168900800:146"/>
that lye near the Banks of the <hi>Tiber.</hi>
There are ſtill ſcatter'd Pillars and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtals,

            <p>In my way to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeeing a high

of Sand winding about their Bottoms,
that are ſometimes filled with ſo many

            <head>FROM
ROME
TO
NAPLES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>PON my Arrival at <hi>Rome</hi>
I took a View of St. <hi>Peters,</hi>
and the <hi>Rotunda,</hi> leaving
the reſt 'till my Return from
<hi>Naples,</hi> when I ſhould have
time and leiſure enough to conſider
what I ſaw. St. <hi>Peters</hi> ſeldom anſwers
Expectation at firſt entering it, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges
it ſelf on all Sides inſenſibly, and
mends upon the Eye every Moment.
The Proportions are ſo very well obſerv'd,
that nothing appears to an Advantage,
or diſtinguiſhes it ſelf above the reſt. It
ſeems neither extreamly high, nor long,
nor broad, becauſe it is all of them in a
juſt Equality. As on the contrary in
our <hi>Gothic</hi> Cathedrals, the Narrowneſs
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0168900800:154"/>
of the Arch makes it riſe in Height, or
run out in Length; the Lowneſs often
opens it in Breadth, or the Defectiveneſs
of ſome other Particular makes any ſingle
Part appear in greater Perfection. Tho'
every thing in this Church is admirable,
the moſt aſtoniſhing Part of it is the
Cupola. Upon my going to the Top
of it, I was ſurpriz'd to find that the
Dome, which we ſee in the Church, is
not the ſame that one looks upon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Doors, the laſt of 'em being a kind
of Caſe to the other, and the Stairs lying
betwixt 'em both, by which one aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends
into the Ball. Had there been
only the outward Dome, it would not
have ſhewn it ſelf to an Advantage to
thoſe that are in the Church; or had
there only been the inward one, it would
ſcarce have been ſeen by thoſe that are
without; had they both been one ſolid
Dome of ſo great a Thickneſs, the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
would have been too weak to have
ſupported it. after having ſurvey'd this
Dome, I went to ſee the <hi>Rotunda,</hi> which
is generally ſaid to have been the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of it. This Church is at preſent ſo
much chang'd from the ancient <hi>Panthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as <hi>Pliny</hi> has deſcrib'd it, that ſome
have been inclin'd to think it is not the
ſame Temple; but the Cavalier <hi>Fonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0168900800:155"/>
has abundantly ſatisfy'd the World in
this Particular, and ſhewn how the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Figure, and Ornaments of the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon,</hi>
have been chang'd into what they
are at preſent. This Author, who is
now eſteem'd the beſt of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Architects, has lately written a Treatiſe
on <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s Amphitheater, which is
not yet Printed.</p>
            <p>After having ſeen theſe Two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-pieces
of Modern and Ancient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,
I have often conſider'd with
my ſelf whether the ordinary Figure
of the Heathen, or that of the Chriſtian
Temples be the moſt beautiful, and the
moſt capable of Magnificence, and can't
forbear thinking the Croſs Figure more
proper for ſuch ſpacious Buildings than
the <hi>Rotund.</hi> I muſt confeſs the Eye is
better fill'd at firſt entering the <hi>Rotund,</hi>
and takes in the whole Beauty and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of the Temple at one view.
But ſuch as are built in the Form of a
Croſs, give us a greater Variety of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Proſpects. Nor is it eaſie to conceive
a more glorious Show in Architecture,
than what a Man meets with in St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
when he ſtands under the Dome.
If he looks upward he is aſtoniſh'd at
the ſpacious Hollow of the Cupola, and
has a Vault on every ſide of him, that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0168900800:156"/>
makes one of the beautifulleſt <hi>Viſtas</hi>
that the Eye can poſſibly paſs thro'. I
know that ſuch as are profeſs'd Admirers
of the Ancients will find abundance
of Chimerical Beauties, the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects
themſelves never thought of, as
one of the moſt Famous of the Moderns
in that Art tells us, the Hole in the
Roof of the <hi>Rotunda</hi> is ſo admirably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd,
that it makes thoſe who are in
the Temple look like Angels, by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
the Light equally on all ſides
of 'em.</p>
            <p>In all the old High-ways, that lead
from <hi>Rome,</hi> one ſees ſeveral little Ruins
on each ſide of 'em, that were formerly
ſo many Sepulchres; for the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
generally bury'd their Dead near
the great Roads.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Quorum Flaminiâ tegitur cinis atque La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinâ.</l>
               <bibl>Juv. S. 1.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>None, but ſome few of a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Quality, having been interred
within the Walls of the City.</p>
            <p>Our Chriſtian Epitaphs, that are to
be ſeen only in Churches, or Church-Yards,
begin often with a <hi>Siſte Viator-Viator
precare ſalutem,</hi> &amp;c. probably in
Imitation of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Inſcriptions,
that generally addreſs'd themſelves to the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0168900800:157"/>
Travellers; as it was impoſſible for 'em
to enter the City, or to go out of it
without paſſing thro' one of theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
Roads, which for a great Length
was nothing elſe but a Street of Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Monuments.</p>
            <p>In my way from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Naples</hi> I
found nothing ſo remarkable as the
Beauty of the Country, and the extream
Poverty of its Inhabitants. It is indeed
an amazing thing to ſee the preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
of <hi>Italy,</hi> when one conſiders
what incredible Multitudes of People
it abounded with during the Reigns of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors: And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Removal of the Imperial Seat,
the Irruptions of the Barbarous Nations,
the Civil Wars of this Country, with
the Hardſhips of its ſeveral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
one can ſcarce imagine how ſo
plentiful a Soil ſhould become ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
unpeopled in Compariſon of what
it once was. We may reckon, by a
very moderate Computation, more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
in the <hi>Campania</hi> of Old <hi>Rome,</hi>
than are now in all <hi>Italy.</hi> And if we
could number up thoſe prodigious Swarms
that had ſettled themſelves in every Part
of this delighful Country, I queſtion
not but that they would amount to more
than can be found, at preſent, in any Six
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0168900800:158"/>
Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> of the ſame Extent.
This Deſolation appears no where greater
than in the Pope's Territories, and yet
there are ſeveral Reaſons would make
a Man expect to ſee theſe Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the beſt regulated, and moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
of any other in <hi>Europe.</hi> Their
Prince is generally a Man of Learning
and Virtue, mature in Years and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
who has ſeldom any Vanity or
Pleaſure to gratify at his People's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
and is neither encumber'd with
Wife, Children or Miſtreſſes; not to
mention the ſuppos'd Sanctity of his
Character, which obliges him in a more
particular manner to conſult the Good
and Happineſs of Mankind. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Church and State are
lodg'd entirely in his own Hands, ſo
that his Government is naturally free
from thoſe Principles of Faction and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
which are mix'd in the very
Compoſition of moſt others. His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are always ready to fall in with his
Deſigns, and are more at his Diſpoſal
than any others of the moſt abſolute
Government, as they have a greater Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
for his Perſon, and not only
court his Favour but his Bleſſing. His
Country is extreamly fruitful, and has
good Havens both for the Adriatic and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0168900800:159"/>
Mediterranean, which is an Advantage
peculiar to himſelf and the <hi>Neapolitans</hi>
above the reſt of the <hi>Italians.</hi> There is
ſtill a Benefit the Pope enjoys above all
other Soveraigns, in drawing great Sums
out of <hi>Spain, Germany</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
that belong to Foreign Princes,
which one would fancy might be no
ſmall Eaſe to his own Subjects. We
may here add, that there is no Place in
<hi>Europe</hi> ſo much frequented by Strangers,
whether they are ſuch as come out of
Curioſity, or ſuch who are obliged to
attend the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> on ſeveral Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
as are many of the Cardinals and
Prelates, that bring conſiderable Sums
into the Pope's Dominions. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all theſe promiſing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
and the long Peace that
has reign'd ſo many years in <hi>Italy,</hi> there
is not a more miſerable People in <hi>Europe</hi>
than the Pope's Subjects. His State is
thin of Inhabitants, and a great Part of
his Soil uncultivated. His Subjects are
wretchedly poor and idle, and have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſufficient Manufactures nor Traffick
to employ 'em. Theſe ill Effects may
ariſe, in a great meaſure, out of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarineſs
of the Government, but I
think they are chiefly to be aſcrib'd to
the very Genius of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0168900800:160"/>
Religion, which here ſhews it ſelf in
its Perfection. It is not ſtrange to find
a Country half unpeopled, where ſo
great a proportion of the Inhabitants of
both Sexes is ty'd under ſuch Vows of
Chaſtity, and where at the ſame time an
Inquiſition forbids all Recruits out
of any other Religion. Nor is it leſs
eaſy to account for the great Poverty
and Want that are to be met with in a
Country which invites into it ſuch
Swarms of Vagabonds, under the Title
of Pilgrims, and ſhuts up in Cloiſters ſuch
an incredible Multitude of young and
luſty Beggars, who, inſtead of encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Common Stock by their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and Induſtry, lye as a dead Weight
on their Fellow Subjects, and conſume
the Charity that ought to ſupport the
Sickly, Old and Decrepid. The many
Hoſpitals, that are every where erected,
ſerve rather to encourage Idleneſs in the
People, than to ſet 'em at Work; not
to mention the great Riches which lye
uſeleſs in Churches and Religious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
with the Multitude of Feſtivals that
muſt never be violated by Trade or Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
To ſpeak truly, they are here
ſo wholly taken up with Mens Souls,
that they neglect the good of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and when, to theſe natural Evils
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0168900800:161"/>
in the Government and Religion, there
ariſes among 'em an Avaritious Pope,
who is for making a Family, it is no
wonder if the People ſink under ſuch a
Complication of Diſtempers. Yet it is
to this Humour of Nepotiſm that <hi>Rome</hi>
owes its preſent Splendor and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
for it would have been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to have furniſh'd out ſo many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Palaces with ſuch a Profuſion of
Pictures, Statues, and the like Ornaments,
had not the Riches of the People at
ſeveral times fallen into the Hands of
many different Families, and of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Perſons; as we may obſerve, tho'
the Bulk of the <hi>Roman</hi> People was more
rich and happy in the times of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
the City of <hi>Rome</hi> receiv'd
all its Beauties and Embelliſhments under
the Emperors. It is probable the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as other Parts of
the Pope's Territories, would be culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
much better than it is, were there
not ſuch an Exorbitant Tax on Corn,
which makes 'em plow up only ſuch Spots
of Ground as turn to the moſt Advantage:
Whereas were the Money to be rais'd
on Lands, with an Exception to ſome
of the more barren Parts, that might
be Tax-free for a certain Term of Years,
every one would turn his Ground to the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0168900800:162"/>
beſt Account, and in a little time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
bring more Money into the Pope's
Treaſury.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Pleaſure I took in my
Journey from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Naples</hi> was in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Fields, Towns, and Rivers that
have been deſcrib'd by ſo many <hi>Claſſic</hi>
Authors, and have been the Scenes of
ſo many great Actions; for this whole
Road is extreamly barren of Curioſities.
It is worth while to have an Eye on
<hi>Horace</hi>'s Voyage to <hi>Brundiſi,</hi> when one
paſſes this way; for by comparing his
ſeveral Stages, and the Road he took,
with thoſe that are obſerv'd at preſent,
we may have ſome Idea of the Changes
that have been made in the Face of this
Country ſince his Time. If we may
gueſs at the common Trevelling of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Quality, among the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
from this Poet's Deſcription of his
Voyage, we may conclude they ſeldom
went above Fourteen Miles a Day over
the <hi>Appian</hi> Way, which was more us'd
by the Noble <hi>Romans</hi> than any other in
<hi>Italy,</hi> as it led to <hi>Naples, Baïae,</hi> and the
moſt delightful Parts of the Nation. It
is indeed very diſagreeable to be carry'd
in haſte over this Pavement.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Firſt Days at <hi>Naples</hi> were
taken up with the Sight of
Proceſſions, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
very magnificent in the
Holy-Week. It would be
tedious to give an Account of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Repreſentations of our Saviour's
Death and Reſurrection, of the Figures
of himſelf, the Bleſſed Virgin, and the
Apoſtles, which are carry'd up and down
on this Occaſion, with the Cruel Penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that ſeveral inflict on themſelves, and
the Multitude of Ceremonies that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
theſe Solemnities. I ſaw, at the
ſame time, a very ſplendid Proceſſion for
the Acceſſion of the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> to
the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> in which the Vice-Roy
bore his Part at the Left Hand of
Cardinal <hi>Cantelmi.</hi> To grace the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,
they expos'd, at the ſame time, the
Blood of St. <hi>Januarius,</hi> which lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
at the approach of the Saint's Head,
tho', as they ſay, it was hard congeal'd
before. I had twice an Opportunity
of ſeeing the Operation of this pretended
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0168900800:170"/>
Miracle, and muſt confeſs I think it ſo
far, from being a real Miracle, that I
look upon it as one of the moſt Bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Tricks that I ever ſaw: Yet it is
this that makes as great a Noiſe as any in
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and that Monſieur
<hi>Paſchal</hi> has hinted at among the reſt, in
his Marks of the true Religion. The
modern <hi>Neapolitans</hi> ſeem to have copy'd
it out from one, which was ſhown in a
Town of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> as
long ago as in <hi>Horace</hi>'s Time.<q>

One may ſee at leaſt that the Heathen
Prieſthood had the ſame kind of Secret
among them, of which the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
are now Maſters.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, tho' I had liv'd above
a Year in a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Country,
I was ſurpriz'd to ſee many Ceremonies
and Superſtitions in <hi>Naples,</hi> that are not
ſo much as thought of in <hi>France.</hi> But
as it is certain there has been a kind of
Secret Reformation made, tho' not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
own'd, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick
Church, ſince the ſpreading of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, ſo we find the ſeveral
Nations are recover'd out of their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
in proportion as they converſe
more or leſs with thoſe of the Reform'd
Churches. For this Reaſon the <hi>French</hi>
are much more enlighten'd than the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Italians,</hi> on occaſion of
their frequent Controverſies with the
<hi>Huguenots</hi>; and we find many of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Gentlemen of our
own Country, who will not ſtick to
laugh at the Superſtitions they ſometimes
meet with in other Nations.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not be particular in deſcribing
the Grandeur of the City of <hi>Naples,</hi>
the Beauty of its Pavement, the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of its Buildings, the Magnificence
of its Churches and Convents, the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0168900800:172"/>
of its Inhabitants, or the Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of its Situation, which ſo many
others have done with a great deal of
Leiſure and Exactneſs. If a War ſhould
break out, the Town has reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the exacting of a large Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
or a Bombardment. It has but
Seven Gallies, a Mole, and Two little
Caſtles, which are capable of hindering
an Enemy's Approaches. Beſides, that
the Sea which lyes near it is not ſubject
to Storms, has no ſenſible Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux,
and is ſo deep that a Veſſel of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
may come up to the very Mole.
The Houſes are flat Roof'd to walk
upon, ſo that every Bomb that fell on
them would take Effect.</p>
            <p>Pictures, Statues, and Pieces of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
are not ſo common at <hi>Naples,</hi> as
one might expect in ſo great and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
a City of <hi>Italy</hi>; for the Vice-Roys
take care to ſend into <hi>Spain</hi> every thing
that is valuable of this Nature. Two
of their fineſt modern Statues are thoſe
of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> plac'd on each
ſide of <hi>Sannazarius</hi>'s Tomb. On the
Face of this Monument, which is all of
Marble, and very neatly wrought, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,
in <hi>Bas relief, Neptune</hi> among
the Satyrs, to ſhow that this Poet was
the Inventer of Piſcatory Eclogues. I
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0168900800:173"/>
remember <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> deſcribes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in one of his Poems, as the firſt that
brought the Muſes to the Sea-ſide, but
he muſt be underſtood only of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
of his own Country. I here ſaw the
Temple that <hi>Sannazarius</hi> mentions in
his Invocation of the Bleſſed Virgin, at
the beginning of his <hi>De partu Virginis,</hi>
which was all rais'd at his own Expence.<q>

There are ſeveral very delightful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
about <hi>Naples,</hi> eſpecially from ſome
of the Religious Houſes; for one ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
finds in <hi>Italy</hi> a Spot of Ground
more agreeable than ordinary, that is
not cover'd with a Convent. The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pola's
of this City, tho' there are many
of them, don't appear to the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
when one ſurveys them at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
as being generally too high and
narrow. The Marquis of <hi>Medina Cido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
in his Vice-Royalty, made the Shell
of a Houſe, which he had not time to
finiſh, that commands a View of the
whole Bay, and would have been a very
noble Building had he brought it to
Perfection.</p>
            <p>It ſtands ſo on the ſide of a Mountain
that it would have had a Garden to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Story, by the help of a Bridge
which was to have been laid over each
Garden.</p>
            <p>The Bay of <hi>Naples</hi> is the moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
one that I ever ſaw. It lyes in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
a round Figure of about Thirty
Miles in the Diameter. Three Parts of
it are ſhelter'd with a noble Circuit of
Woods and Mountains. The high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory
of <hi>Surrentum</hi> divides it from
the Bay of <hi>Salernum.</hi> Between the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Point of this Promontory, and the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0168900800:175"/>
Iſle of <hi>Caprea,</hi> the Sea enters by a
Streight of about Three Miles wide.
This Iſland ſtands as a vaſt Mole, which
ſeems to have been planted there on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to break the Violence of the Waves
that run into the Bay. It lyes long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
almoſt in a parallel Line to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
The exceſſive Height of its Rocks
ſecures a great part of the Bay from
Winds and Waves, which enter again
between the other End of this Iſland
and the Promontory of <hi>Miſeno.</hi> The
Bay of <hi>Naples</hi> is call'd the <hi>Crater</hi> by the
old Geographers, probably from this its
Reſemblance to a round Bowl half fill'd
with Liquor. Perhaps <hi>Virgil,</hi> who
compos'd here a great part of his <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neids,</hi>
took from hence the Plan of that
beautiful Harbour, which he has made
in his Firſt Book, for the <hi>Libyan</hi> Port is
but the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Bay in little.<q>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0168900800:177"/>
have ſo well contriv'd it, that tho' the
Subjects are miſerably haraſs'd and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd,
the greateſt of their Oppreſſors
are thoſe of their own Body. I ſhall not
mention any thing of the Clergy, who are
ſufficiently reproached in moſt Itinera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for the univerſal Poverty that one
meets with in this noble and plentiful
Kingdom. A great Part of the People
is in a State of Vaſſallage to the Barons,
who are the harſheſt Tyrants in the
World to thoſe that are under them.
The Vaſſals indeed are allow'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to bring in their Complaints and
Appeals to the Vice-Roy, who, to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Diviſions, and gain the Hearts of
the Populace, does not ſtick at Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
and Chaſtiſing their Maſters ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſeverely on occaſion. The Subjects
of the Crown are notwithſtanding much
more rich and happy than the Vaſſals
of the Barons. Inſomuch that when
the King has been upon the point of
ſelling a Town to one of his Barons,
the Inhabitants have rais'd the Sum up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelves, and preſented it to the
King, that they might keep out of ſo
inſupportable a Slavery. Another way
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have taken to grind the
<hi>Neapolitans,</hi> and yet to take off the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
from themſelves, has been by ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0168900800:178"/>
ſeveral Courts of Juſtice, with a
very ſmall Penſion for ſuch as fit at the
Head of them, ſo that they are tempted
to take Bribes, keep Cauſes undecided,
encourage Law-ſuits, and do all they
can to fleece the People, that they may
have wherewithal to ſupport their own
Dignity. It is incredible how great a
Multitude of Retainers to the Law there
are at <hi>Naples.</hi> It is commonly ſaid, that
when <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eleventh had deſir'd
the Marquis of <hi>Carpio</hi> to furniſh him
with Thirty Thouſand Head of Swine,
the Marquis anſwer'd him, that for his
Swine he could not ſpare them, but if
his Holineſs had occaſion for Thirty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Lawyers he had them at his Service.
Theſe Gentlemen find a continual Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
for the fiery Temper of the <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans,</hi>
and hinder them from uniting
in ſuch common Friendſhips and Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as might endanger the Safety of the
Government. There are very few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Conſideration who have not a
Cauſe depending; for when a <hi>Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
Cavalier has nothing elſe to do, he
gravely ſhuts himſelf up in his Cloſet,
and falls a tumbling over his Papers to
ſee if he can ſtart a Law Suit, and
plague any of his Neighbours. So much
is the Genius of this People chang'd ſince
<hi>Statius</hi>'s Time.<q>

            </p>
            <p>There is another Circumſtance which
makes the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> in a very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
manner, the Oppreſſors of each other.
The Gables of <hi>Naples</hi> are very high on
Oil, Wine, Tobacco, and indeed on al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every thing that can be eaten,
drank or worn. There would have been
one on Fruit, had not <hi>Maſſianello</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
aboliſh'd it, as it has probably
put a ſtop to many others. What makes
theſe Impoſts more intolerable to the
poorer ſort, they are laid on all Butchers
Meat, while at the ſame time the Fowl
and Gibier are Tax free. Beſides, all
Meat being Taxed equally by the Pound,
it happens that the Duty lyes heavieſt
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0168900800:180"/>
on the coarſer ſorts, which are moſt
likely to fall to the ſhare of the common
People, ſo that Beef perhaps pays a Third,
and Veal a Tenth of its Price to the
Government, a Pound of either ſort ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the ſame Tax fix'd on it. Theſe
Gabels are moſt of them at preſent in
the Hands of private Men; for as the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> has had occaſion for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
he has borrow'd it of the Rich <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans,</hi>
on Condition that they ſhould
receive the Intereſt out of ſuch or ſuch
Gabels 'till he could repay them the
Principal.</p>
            <p>This he has repeated ſo often that at
preſent there is ſcarce a ſingle Gabel
unmortgag'd; ſo that there is no Place
in <hi>Europe</hi> which pays greater Taxes,
and at the ſame time no Prince who
draws leſs Advantage from them. In
other Countries the People have the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of ſeeing the Mony they give
ſpent in the Neceſſities, Defence, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of their State, or at leaſt in the
Vanity or Pleaſures of their Prince: but
here moſt of it goes to the enriching
of their Fellow-Subjects. If there was
not ſo great a Plenty of every thing in
<hi>Naples</hi> the People could not bear it. The
<hi>Spaniard</hi> however reaps this Advantage
from the preſent poſture of Affairs, that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0168900800:181"/>
the Murmurs of the Peeple are turn'd
upon their own Countrymen, and what
is more conſiderable, that almoſt all the
Perſons, of the greateſt Wealth and
Power in <hi>Naples,</hi> are engag'd by their
own Intereſts to pay theſe Impoſitions
chearfully, and to ſupport the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which has laid them on. For this
Reaſon, tho' the poorer ſort are for the
Emperor, few of the Perſons of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
can endure to think of a Change
in their preſent Eſtabliſhment; tho'
there is no queſtion but the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> will Reform moſt of theſe Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
by breaking or retrenching the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Barons, by cancelling ſeveral
unneceſſary Employs, or by ranſoming or
taking the Gabels into his own Hands. I
have been told too, there is a Law of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth ſomething like our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Mort-main, which has laid dormant
ever ſince his Time, and will probably
have new Life put into it under the
Reign of an active Prince. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Naples</hi> have been always very
notorious for leading a Life of Lazineſs
and Pleaſure, which I take to ariſe part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of the wonderful Plenty of their
Country, that does not make Labour ſo
neceſſary to them, and partly out of the
Temper of their Climate, that relaxes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0168900800:182"/>
the Fibres of their Bodies, and diſpoſes
the People to ſuch an idle indolent Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
Whatever it proceeds from, we
find they were formerly as famous for it
as they are at preſent.</p>

ANTIQUITIES
AND
Natural Curioſities
That lye near the
CITY of Naples.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T about eight Miles Diſtance
from <hi>Naples</hi> lyes a very noble
Scene of Antiquities. What
they call <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Tomb is
the firſt that one meets with
on the Way thither. It is certain this Poet
was bury'd at <hi>Naples,</hi> but I think it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as certain that his Tomb ſtood on the
other ſide of the Town which looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Veſuvio.</hi> By this Tomb is the
Entry into the Grotto of <hi>Pauſilypo.</hi>
The common People of <hi>Naples</hi> believe
it to have been wrought by Magick, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0168900800:186"/>
that <hi>Virgil</hi> was the Magician; who
is in greater Repute among the <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans</hi>
for having made the Grotto, than
the <hi>Aeneid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a Man would form to himſelf a juſt
Idea of this Place, he muſt fancy a vaſt
Rock undermin'd from one End to the
other, and a Highway running thro' it,
near as long and as broad as the Mall in
St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park. This Subterraneous
Paſſage is much mended ſince <hi>Seneca</hi>
gave ſo bad a Character of it. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
at both Ends is higher than the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Parts of it, and ſinks by degrees, to
fling in more Light upon the reſt. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the middle are Two large Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
bor'd thro' the Roof of the Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
to let in Light and freſh Air.</p>
            <p>There are no where about the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any vaſt Heaps of Stones, tho' it is
certain the great Quantities of 'em that
are dug out of the Rock could not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceal themſelves, had they not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
been conſum'd in the Moles and
Buildings of <hi>Naples.</hi> This confirm'd me
in a Conjecture which I made at the
firſt ſight of this Subterraneous Paſſage,
that it was not at firſt deſign'd ſo much for
a High-way as for a Quarry of Stone, but
that the Inhabitants, finding a double Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by it, hew'd it into the Form we
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0168900800:187"/>
now ſee. Perhaps the ſame Deſign gave
the Original to the <hi>SibyL</hi>'s Grotto, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the prodigious Multitude of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
that ſtood in its Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>I remember when I was at <hi>Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun</hi>
in <hi>France</hi> I met with a very curious
Perſon, a Member of one of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Univerſities. He had ſtay'd a Day
or Two in the Town longer than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
to take the Meaſures of ſeveral
empty Spaces that had been cut in the
Sides of a neighbouring Mountain.
Some of 'em were ſupported with Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
form'd out of the Rock, ſome were
made in the Faſhion of Galleries, and
ſome not unlike Amphitheaters. The
Gentleman had made to himſelf ſeveral
ingenious Hypotheſes concerning the
uſe of theſe Subterraneous Apartments,
and from thenee collected the vaſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
and Luxury of the ancient
<hi>Chateaudunois.</hi> But upon communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Thoughts on this Subject to one
of the moſt Learned of the Place, he
was not a little ſurpriz'd to hear that
theſe ſtupendous Works of Art were
only ſo many Quarries of Free-Stone,
that had been wrought into different
Figures, according as the Veins of it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
the Workmen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0168900800:188"/>
About Five Miles from the Grotto
of <hi>Pauſilypo</hi> lye the Remains of <hi>Puteoli</hi>
and <hi>Bajae,</hi> in a ſoft Air and a delicious
Situation.</p>
            <p>The Country about 'em, by reaſon of
its vaſt Caverns and Subterraneous Fires,
has been miſerably torn in Pieces by
Earthquakes, ſo that the whole Face of
it is quite chang'd from what it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
The Sea has overwhelm'd a
Multitude of Palaces, which may be ſeen
at the Bottom of the Water in a calm
Day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lucrine</hi> Lake is but a Puddle in
Compariſon of what it once was, its
Springs having been ſunk in an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
or ſtopp'd up by Mountains that
have fallen upon 'em. The Lake of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernus,</hi>
formerly ſo famous for its Steams
of Poiſon, is now plentifully ſtock'd with
Fiſh and Fowl. Mount <hi>Gaurus,</hi> from
one of the fruitfulleſt Parts in <hi>Italy,</hi> is
become one of the moſt barren. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Fields, which were laid out in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Groves and Gardens, are now na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Plains, ſmoaking with Sulphur, or
encumber'd with Hills that have been
thrown up by Eruptions of Fire. The
Works of Art lye in no leſs Diſorder
than thoſe of Nature, for that which
was once the moſt Beautiful Spot of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly,</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0168900800:189"/>
cover'd with Temples and Palaces,
adorn'd by the greateſt of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Common-wealth, embeliſh'd by many
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and celebrated
by the beſt of their Poets, has now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſhow but the Ruins of its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Splendor, and a great Magnificence
in Confuſion.</p>
            <p>The Mole of <hi>Puteoli</hi> has been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by ſeveral Authors for <hi>Caligula</hi>'s
Bridge. They have all been led into
this Error from the Make of it, becauſe
it ſtands on Arches. But to paſs over
the many Arguments that may be
brought againſt this Opinion, I ſhall here
take away the Foundation of it, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down an Inſcription mention'd by
<hi>Julius Capitolinus</hi> in the Life of <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

            </p>
            <p>It would have been very difficult to
have made ſuch a Mole as this of <hi>Pute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi>
in a Place where they had not ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
a Commodity as the Earth of <hi>Puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuola,</hi>
which immediately hardens in the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0168900800:190"/>
Water, and after a little lying in it looks
rather like Stone than Mortar. It was
this that gave the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> an
Opportunity of making ſo many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
on the Sea, and of laying
the Foundations of their Villas and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
within the very Borders of it, as

               <hi>Horace</hi> has elegantly deſcribed it more
than once.</p>
            <p>About Four Years ago they dug up a
great Piece of Marble near <hi>Puzzuola,</hi>
with ſeveral Figures and Letters Engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
round it, which have given occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſome Diſputes among the Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

by the Fourteen Cities of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which
were flung down by an Earthquake; the
ſame that, according to the Opinion of
many Learned Men, happen'd at our
Saviour's Crucifixion. They have found
in the Letters, which are ſtill legible,
the Names of the ſeveral Cities, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
in each Figure ſomething particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to the City, of which it repreſents
the Genius. There are two Medals of

It is probable this might have been
the Poſture of the Statue, which in all
likelihood does not lye far from the Place
where they took up the Pedeſtal; for
they ſay there were other great Pieces
of Marble near it, and ſeveral of 'em In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd,
but that no Body would be at
the Charges of bringing them to light.
The Pedeſtal it ſelf lay neglected in an
open Field when I ſaw it. I ſhall not
be particular on the Ruins of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater,
the ancient Reſervoirs of
Water, the <hi>Sibyl</hi>'s Grotto, the <hi>Centum
Camerae,</hi> the Sepulchre of <hi>Agrippina Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s
Mother, with ſeveral other Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of leſs Note, that lye in the
Neighbourhood of this Bay, and have
been often deſcrib'd by many others. I
muſt confeſs, after having ſurvey'd the
Antiquities about <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> I
cannot but think that our Admiration of
'em does not ſo much ariſe out of their
Greatneſs as Uncommonneſs.</p>
            <p>There are indeed many extraordinary
Ruins, but I believe a traveller would
not be ſo much aſtoniſh'd at 'em, did he
find any Works of the ſame kind in his
own Country. Amphitheatres, Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
Arches, Baths, Grotto's, Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs,
Rotunda's, Highways pav'd for
ſo great a Length, Bridges of ſuch an
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0168900800:193"/>
amazing Height, Subterraneous Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for the Reception of Rain and
Snow-Water, are moſt of 'em at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
out of Faſhion, and only to be met
with among the Antiquities of <hi>Italy.</hi>
We are therefore immediately ſurpriz'd
when we ſee any conſiderable Sums laid
out in any thing of this Nature, tho'
at the ſame time there is many a <hi>Gothic</hi>
Cathedral in <hi>England,</hi> that has coſt
more Pains and Mony than ſeveral of
theſe celebrated Works. Among the
Ruins of the old Heathen Temples they
ſhow'd me what they call the Chamber
of <hi>Venus,</hi> which ſtands a little behind
her Temple. It is wholly dark, and has
ſeveral Figures on the Cieling wrought
in <hi>Stucco,</hi> that ſeem to repreſent Luſt and
Strength by the Emblems of naked <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters</hi>
and <hi>Gladiators, Tritons</hi> and <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taurs,</hi>
&amp;c. ſo that one would gueſs it
has formerly been the Scene of many
lewd Myſteries. On the other ſide of
<hi>Naples</hi> are the Catacombs. Theſe muſt
have been full of Stench and Loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
if the dead Bodies that lay in 'em
were left to rot in open Nitches, as an
Eminent Author of our own Country
Imagine's. But upon examining 'em I
find they were each of 'em ſtop'd up:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0168900800:194"/>
without doubt, as ſoon as the Corps
was laid in it. For at the Mouth of the
Nitch one always finds the Rock cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
little Channels, to faſten the Board
or Marble that was to cloſe it up, and I
think I did not ſee one which had not
ſtill ſome Mortar ſticking in it. In ſome
I found pieces of Tiles that exactly tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd
with the Channel, and in others a
little Wall of Bricks, that ſometimes
ſtopp'd up above a quarter of the Nitch,
the reſt having been broken down. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

of Moſaic Work on its Covering, for I
obſerv'd at one End of it ſeveral little
Pieces of Marble rang'd together after
that manner. 'Tis probable they were
adorn'd, more or leſs, according to the
Quality of the Dead. One would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

            <p>The Natural Curioſities about <hi>Naples</hi>
are as numerous and extraordinary as the
Artificial. I ſhall ſet them down, as I
have done the other, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to their Situation. The Grotto
<hi>del Cani</hi> is famous for the poiſonous
Steams which float within a Foot of its
Surface. The Sides of the Grotto are
mark'd with Green, as high as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
of the Vapour reaches. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Experiments are as follow: A Dog,
that has his Noſe held in the Vapour,
loſes all Signs of Life in a very little
time; but if carry'd into the open Air,
or thrown into a Neighbouring Lake,
he immediately recovers, if he is not
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0168900800:197"/>
quite gone. A Torch, Snuff and all,
goes out in a Moment when dipp'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Vapour. A Piſtol cannot take Fire
in it. I ſplit a Reed, and laid in the
Channel of it a Train of Gun-powder,
ſo that one End of the Reed was above
the Vapour, and the other at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of it; and I found, tho' the Steam
was ſtrong enough to hinder a Piſtol
from taking Fire in it, and to quench a
lighted Torch, that it could not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Train of Fire when it had once
begun Flaſhing, nor hinder it from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the very End. This Experiment
I repeated twice or thrice, to ſee if I
could quite diſſipate the Vapour, which
I did in ſo great a meaſure, that one
might eaſily let off a Piſtol in it. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
how long a Dog was in Expiring
the firſt time, and after his Recovery,
and found no ſenſible difference. A Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
bore it Nine Minutes the firſt time
we put it in, and Ten the Second. When
we brought it out after the firſt Trial,
it took ſuch a vaſt quantity of Air into
its Lungs, that it ſwell'd almoſt twice
as big as before; and it was perhaps on
this Stock of Air that it liv'd a Minute
longer the ſecond time. Doctor <hi>Connor</hi>
made a Diſcourſe in one of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
at <hi>Rome</hi> upon the Subject of this
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0168900800:198"/>
Grotto, which he has ſince Printed in
<hi>England.</hi> He attributes the Death of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
and the Extinction of Lights, to
a great Rarefaction of the Air, caus'd
by the Heat and Eruption of the Steams.
But how is it poſſible for theſe Steams,
tho' in never ſo great quantity, to reſiſt
the Preſſure of the whole Atmoſphere?
And as for the Heat, it is but very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable.
However, to ſatisfie my
ſelf, I plac'd a thin Viol, well ſtopp'd
up with Wax, within the Smoak of
the Vapour, which would certainly have
burſt in an Air rarefy'd enough to kill
a Dog, or quench a Torch, but nothing
follow'd upon it. However, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all further Doubt, I borrow'd a
Weather-glaſs, and ſo fix'd it in the
Grotto, that the <hi>Stagnum</hi> was wholly
cover'd with the Vapour, but I could
not perceive the Quickſilver ſunk after
half an Hour's ſtanding in it. This Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
is generally ſuppos'd to be Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous,
tho' I can ſee no Reaſon for
ſuch a Suppoſition. He that dips his
Hand in it finds no Smell that it leaves
upon it; and tho' I put a whole Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of lighted Brimſtone Matches to the
Smoak, they all went out in an Inſtant,
as if immers'd in Water. Whatever is
the Compoſition of the Vapour, let it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0168900800:199"/>
have but one Quality of being very
Glewy or Viſcous, and I believe it will
mechanicaly ſolve all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
of the Grotto. It's Unctuouſneſs will
make it heavy, and unfit for mounting
higher than it does, unleſs the Heat of
the Earth, which is juſt ſtrong enough
to agitate, and bear it up at a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the Surface, were much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than it is to rarifie and ſcatter it. It
will be too groſs and thick to keep the
Lungs in play for any time, ſo that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
will die in it ſooner or later, as
their Blood Circulates ſlower or faſter.
Fire will live in it no longer than in
Water, becauſe it wraps it ſelf in the
ſame manner about the Flame, and by
its Continuity hinders any quantity of
Air or Nitre from coming to its Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.
The Parts of it however are not
ſo compact as thoſe of Liquors, nor
therefore tenacious enough to intercept
the Fire that has once caught a Train
of Gun-Powder, for which Reaſon they
may be quite broken and diſpers'd by the
Repetition of this Experiment. There
is an unctuous clammy Vapour that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
from the Stum of Grapes, when
they lye maſh'd together in the Vat,
which puts out a Light when dipp'd
into it, and perhaps would take away
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0168900800:200"/>
the Breath of weaker Animals, were it
put to the Trial.</p>
            <p>It would be endleſs to reckon up the
different Baths, to be met with in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
that ſo much abounds in Sulphur.
There is ſcarce a Diſeaſe which has not
one adapted to it. A Stranger is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
led into that they call <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Bath,
and ſeveral Voyage-Writers pretend
there is a cold Vapour riſing from the
Bottom of it, which refreſhes thoſe
who ſtoop into it. 'Tis true the Heat
is much more ſupportable to one that
ſtoops, than to one that ſtands upright,
becauſe the Steams of Sulphur gather
in the Hollow of the Arch about
a Man's Head, and are therefore
much thicker and warmer in that
Part than at the Bottom. The Three
Lakes of <hi>Agnano, Avernus,</hi> and the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crin,</hi>
have now nothing in them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
The <hi>Monte Novo</hi> was thrown out
by an Eruption of Fire, that happen'd
in the Place where now the Mountain
ſtands. The <hi>Sulfatara</hi> is very ſurpriſing
to one who has not ſeen Mount <hi>Veſuvio.</hi>
But there is nothing about <hi>Naples,</hi> nor
indeed in any Part of <hi>Italy,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
our Admiration ſo much as this
Mountain. I muſt confeſs the Idea I
had of it, did not anſwer the real Image
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0168900800:201"/>
of the Place when I came to ſee it; I
ſhall therefore give the Deſcription of
it as it then lay.</p>
            <p>This Mountain ſtands at about Six
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles diſtance from <hi>Naples,</hi> tho'
by reaſon of its Height, it ſeems much
nearer to thoſe that ſurvey it from the
Town. In our Way to it we paſs'd by
what was one of thoſe Rivers of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Matter, that ran from it in a late E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
This looks at a diſtance like a
new plow'd Land, but, as you come
near it you ſee nothing but a long Heap
of heavy disjointed Clods lying one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another. There are innumerable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
and Interſtices among the ſeveral
Pieces, ſo that the Surface is all broken
and irregular. Sometimes a great Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſtands like a Rock above the reſt,
ſometimes the whole Heap lyes in a
kind of Channel, and in other Places
has nothing like Banks to confine it,
but riſes Four or Five Foot high in the
open Air, without ſpreading abroad on
either ſide. This, I think, is a plain
Demonſtration that theſe Rivers were
not as they are uſually repreſented, ſo
many Streams of running Matter; for
how could a Liquid, that lay hardening
by degrees, ſettle in ſuch a furrow'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compact
Surface? Were the River a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0168900800:202"/>
Confuſion of never ſo many different
Bodies, if they had been all actually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
they would at leaſt have form'd
one continu'd Cruſt, as we ſee the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi>
of Metals always gathers into a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Piece, let it be compounded of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Heterogeneous Parts. I am apt to
think therefore, that theſe huge unwiel'dy
Lumps that now lye one upon another,
as if thrown together by Accident, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
in the melted Matter rigid and
unliquify'd, floating in it like Cakes of
Ice in a River, and that, as the Fire and
Ferment gradually abated, they adjuſted
themſeves together as well as their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Figures would permit, and by this
means fell into ſuch an interrupted diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
Heap, as we now find it. What
was the melted Matter lyes at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
out of ſight. After having quitted
the Side of this long Heap, which was
once a Stream of Fire, we came to the
Roots of the Mountain, and had a very
troubleſome March to gain the Top of
it. It is cover'd on all Sides with a kind
of burnt Earth, very dry, and crumbled
into Powder, as if it had been artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſifted. It is very hot under the Feet,
and mix'd with ſeveral burnt Stones and
Cakes of Cinders, which have been
thrown out at different times. A Man
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0168900800:203"/>
ſinks almoſt a Foot in the Earth, and
generally loſes half a Step by ſliding
backwards. When we had climb'd this
Mountain we diſcover'd the Top of it
to be a wide naked Plain, ſmoaking with
Sulphur in ſeveral Places, and probably
undermin'd with Fire, for we conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it to be hollow by the Sound it
made under our Feet. In the midſt of
this Plain ſtands a high Hill in the ſhape
of a Sugar-loaf, ſo very ſteep that there
would be no mounting or deſcending it,
were not it made up of ſuch a looſe
crumbled Earth as I have before deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
The Air of this Place muſt be
very much impregnated with Salt-peter,
as appears by the Specks of it on the
Sides of the Mountain, where one can
ſcarce find a Stone that has not the Top
white with it. After we had, with
much ado, conquer'd this Hill, we ſaw
in the midſt of it the preſent Mouth of
<hi>Veſuvio,</hi> that goes ſhelving down on all
Sides 'till above a Hundred Yards deep,
as near as we could gueſs, and has about
Three or Four Hundred in the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for it ſeems a perfect Round. This
vaſt Hollow is generally fill'd with
Smoak, but, by the Advantage of a
Wind that blew for us, we had a very
clear and diſtinct ſight of it. The Sides
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0168900800:204"/>
appear all over ſtain'd with Mixtures of
White, Green, Red and Yellow, and
have ſeveral Rocks ſtanding out of
them that look like pure Brimſtone.
The Bottom was entirely cover'd, and
tho' we look'd very narrowly we could
ſee nothing like a Hole in it; the Smoak
breaking through ſeveral imperceptible
Cracks in many Places. The very Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
was firm Ground when we ſaw it,
as we concluded from the Stones we
flung upon it, and I queſtion not but
one might then have croſs'd the Bottom,
and have gone up on the other Side of
it with very little Danger, unleſs from
ſome accidental Breath of Wind. In
the late Eruptions this great Hollow
was like a vaſt Caldron fill'd with
glowing and melted Matter, which, as
it boil'd over in any Part, ran down the
Sides of the Mountain, and made Five
ſuch Rivers as that before-mention'd.
In proportion as the Heat ſlacken'd, this
burning Matter muſt have ſubſided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Bowels of the Mountain, and as
it ſunk very leiſurely had time to Cake
together, and form the Bottom which
covers the Mouth of that dreadful Vault
that lyes underneath it. The next E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
or Earthquake will probably
break in Pieces this falſe Bottom, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0168900800:205"/>
quite change the preſent Face of
Things.</p>
            <p>This whole Mountain, ſhaped like a
Sugar-loaf, has been made at ſeveral
times, by the prodigious Quantities of
Earth and Cinders, which have been
flung up out of the Mouth that lyes in
the midſt of them, ſo that it encreaſes in
Bulk at every Eruption, the Aſhes ſtill
falling down the Sides of it, like the
Sand in an Hour-Glaſs. A Gentleman
of <hi>Naples</hi> told me, that in his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it had gain'd Twenty Foot in Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and I queſtion not but in length of
time it will cover the whole Plain, and
make one Mountain with that on which
it now ſtands.</p>
            <p>In thoſe Parts of the Sea, that are not
far from the Roots of this Mountain,
they find ſometimes a very fragrant Oil,
which is ſold dear, and makes a rich Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume.
The Surface of the Sea is, for a
little Space, cover'd with its Bubbles
during the time that it riſes, which they
skim off into their Boats, and afterwards
ſet a ſeparating in Pots and Jars. They
ſay its Sources never run but in a calm
warm Weather. The Agitations of the
Water perhaps hinder them from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
it at other times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0168900800:206"/>
Among the Natural Curioſities of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
I cannot forbear mentioning their
manner of furniſhing the Town with
Snow, which they here uſe inſtead of
Ice, becauſe, as they ſay, it cools or
congeals any Liquor ſooner. There is
a great Quantity of it conſum'd yearly,
for they drink very few Liquors, not
ſo much as Water, that have not lain
in <hi>Freſco,</hi> and every Body, from the
higheſt to the loweſt, makes uſe of it;
inſomuch that a Scarcity of Snow would
raiſe a Mutiny at <hi>Naples,</hi> as much as a
Dearth of Corn or Proviſions in another
Country. To prevent this the King
has ſold the Monopoly of it to certain
Perſons, who are oblig'd to furniſh the
City with it all the Year at ſo much
the Pound. They have a high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
at about Eighteen Miles from the
Town, which has ſeveral Pits dug into
it. Here they employ many poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at ſuch a Seaſon of the Year to roll
in vaſt Balls of Snow, which they ram
together, and cover from the Sun-ſhine.
Out of theſe Reſervoirs of Snow they
cut ſeveral Lumps, as they have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for them, and ſend them on Aſſes to
the Sea-ſide, where they are carry'd off
in Boats, and diſtributed to ſeveral Shops
at a ſettled Price, that from time to time
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0168900800:207"/>
ſupply the whole City of <hi>Naples.</hi> While
the <hi>Banditti</hi> continu'd their Diſorders
in this Kingdom, they often put the
Snow-Merchants under Contribution,
and threaten'd them, if they appear'd
tardy in their Payments, to deſtroy their
Magazines, which they ſay might eaſily
have been effected by the Infuſion of ſome
Barrels of Oil.</p>
            <p>It would have been tedious to have
put down the many Deſcriptions that
the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets have made of ſeveral
of the Places mention'd in this Chapter:
I ſhall therefore conclude it with the
general Map which <hi>Silius Italicus</hi> has
given us of this great Bay of <hi>Naples.</hi>
Moſt of the Places he mentions lye
within the ſame Proſpect, and if I have
paſs'd over any of them, it is becauſe I

ISLE of CAPREA.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ſtay'd longer at <hi>Naples</hi>
than I at firſt deſign'd, I could
not diſpenſe with my ſelf from
making a little Voyage to
the Iſle of <hi>Caprea,</hi> as being
very deſirous to ſee a Place which had
been the Retirement of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> for
ſome time, and the Reſidence of <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
for ſeveral Years. The Iſland lyes
Four Miles in Length from Eaſt to Weſt,
and about one in Breadth. The Weſtern
Part, for about Two Miles in Length,
is a continu'd Rock vaſtly high, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible
on the Sea-ſide. It has how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the greateſt Town in the Iſland,
that goes under the Name of <hi>Ano-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prea,</hi>
and is in ſeveral Places cover'd with
a very fruitful Soil. The Eaſtern End
of the Iſle riſes up in Precipices very
near as high, tho' not quite ſo long,
as the Weſtern. Between theſe Eaſtern
and Weſtern Mountains lyes a Slip of
lower Ground, which runs acroſs the
Iſland, and is one of the pleaſanteſt Spots
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0168900800:214"/>
I have ſeen. It is hid with Vines,
Figs, Oranges, Almonds, Olives, Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
and Fields of Corn, which look
extremely freſh and beautiful, and make
up the moſt delightful: little Landskip
imaginable, when they are ſurvey'd from
the Tops of the neighbouring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
Here ſtands the Town of <hi>Caprea,</hi>
the Biſhop's Palace, and Two or Three
Convents. In the midſt of this fruitful
Tract of Land riſes a Hill, that was
probably cover'd with Buildings in <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>'s
Time. There are ſtill ſeveral
Ruins on the Sides of it, and about the
Top are found Two or Three dark Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries
low built, and cover'd with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's
Work, tho' at preſent they appear
over-grown with Graſs. I enter'd one
of 'em that is a Hundred Paces in Length.
I obſerved, as ſome of the Countrymen
were digging into the Sides of this
Mountain, that what I took for ſolid
Earth was only Heaps of Brick, Stone,
and other Rubbiſh, skinn'd over with a
Covering of Vegetables. But the moſt
conſiderable Ruin is that which ſtands
on the very Extremity of the Eaſtern
Promontory, where are ſtill ſome Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
left, very high and arch'd at Top.
I have not indeed ſeen the Remains of
any ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Buildings, that have
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0168900800:215"/>
not been Roof'd with either Vaults or
Arches. The Rooms I am mentioning
ſtand deep in the Earth, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like Windows or Chimnies, which
makes me think they were formerly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bathing Places or Reſervoirs of
Water. An old Hermit lives at preſent
among the Ruins of this Palace, who
loſt his Companion a few Years ago by
a Fall from the Precipice. He told me
they had often found Medals and Pipes
of Lead, as they dug among the Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh,
and that not many Years ago they
diſcover'd a pav'd Road running under
Ground, from the Top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the Sea-ſide, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
confirm'd to me by a Gentleman
of the Iſland. There is a very noble
Proſpect from this Place. On the one
ſide lyes a vaſt Extent of Seas, that runs
abroad further than the Eye can reach.
Juſt oppoſite ſtands the Green Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of <hi>Surrentum,</hi> and on the other ſide
the whole Circuit of the Bay of <hi>Naples.</hi>
This Proſpect, according to <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
was more agreeable before the burning
of <hi>Veſuvio</hi>; that Mountain probably,
which after the firſt Eruption look'd
like a great Pile of Aſhes, was in <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>'s
Time ſhaded with Woods and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards;

The whole Iſland was probably
cut into ſeveral eaſie Aſcents, planted
with Variety of Palaces, and adorn'd
with as great a Multitude of Groves
and Gardens as the Situation of the Place

            <p>In ſailing round <hi>Caprea</hi> we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
with many rude Proſpects of
Rocks and Precipices, that riſe in
ſeveral Places half a Mile high in
Perpendicular. At the Bottom of 'em
are Caves and Grotto's, form'd by the
continual breaking of the Waves upon
'em. I enter'd one which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
call <hi>Grotto Oſcuro,</hi> and after the
Light of the Sun was a little worn off
my Eyes, could ſee all the Parts of it
diſtinctly, by a glimmering Reflection
that play'd upon 'em from the Surface
of the Water. The Mouth is low and
narrow, but, after having enter'd pretty
far in, the Grotto opens it ſelf on both
Sides in an oval Figure of an Hundred
Yeads from one Extremity to the other,
as we were toln, for it would not have
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0168900800:221"/>
been ſafe meaſuring of it. The Roof
is vaulted, and Diſtils freſh Water from
every Part of it, which fell upon us as
faſt as the firſt Droppings of a Shower.
The Inhabitants and <hi>Neapolitans</hi> who
have heard of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Grotto's, will
have this to be one of 'em, but there
are ſeveral Reaſons that ſhow it to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.
For beſides the little uſe we can
conceive of ſuch a dark Cavern of Salt
Waters, there are no where any Marks
of the Chiſſel; the Sides are of a ſoft
mouldering Stone, and one ſees many
of the like hollow Spaces worn in the
Bottoms of the Rocks, as they are more
or leſs able to reſiſt the Impreſſions of
the Water that beats againſt 'em.</p>
            <p>Not far from this Grotto lye the <hi>Sire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Scopuli,</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Voyage; they are Two
or Three ſharp Rocks that ſtand about
a Stone's Throw from the South-ſide of
the Iſland, and are generally beaten by
Waves and Tempeſts, which are much
more violent on the South than on the
North of <hi>Caprea.</hi>

            <p>I have before ſaid that they often find
Medals in this Iſland. Many of thoſe
they call the <hi>Spintriae,</hi> which <hi>Aretin</hi> has
copy'd, have been dug up here. I know
none of the Antiquaries that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
on this Subject, and find nothing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
of it where I thought it moſt
likely to be met with, in <hi>Patin</hi>'s Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Suetonius</hi> illuſtrated by Medals.
Thoſe I have convers'd with about it,
are of Opinion they were made to ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule
the Brutality of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> tho' I
cannot but believe they were ſtamp'd by
his Order. They are unqueſtionably An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,
and no bigger than Medals of the
Third Magnitude. They bear on one
Side ſome lewd Invention of that Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Society which <hi>Suetonius</hi> calls <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroſi
concubitûs repertores,</hi> and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Number of the Medal. I have
ſeen of 'em as high as to Twenty. I can't
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0168900800:223"/>
think they were made as a Jeſt on the
Emperor, becauſe Raillery on Coins is
of a Modern Date. I know but Two
in the Upper Empire, beſides the <hi>Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae,</hi>
that lye under any Suſpicion of it.
The firſt is one of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi>
where, in Compliment to the Emperor
and Empreſs, they have ſtamp'd on the
Reverſe the Figure of <hi>Venus</hi> careſſing
<hi>Mars,</hi> and endeavouring to detain him
from the Wars.<figure>

            </p>
            <p>This unluckily brings to Mind <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi>'s
Fondneſs for the Gladiator, and
is therefore interpreted by many as a
hidden Piece of Satyr. But beſides, that
ſuch a Thought was inconſiſtent with
the Gravity of a Senate, how can one
imagine that the Fathers would have
dar'd Affront the Wife of <hi>Aurelius,</hi> and
the Mother of <hi>Commodus,</hi> or that they
could think of giving Offence to an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
whom they afterwards deify'd, and
to an Emperor that was the Darling of
the Army and People?</p>
            <p>The other Medal is a Golden one of
<hi>Gallienus</hi> preſerv'd in the <hi>French</hi> King's
Cabinet; it is inſcrib'd <hi>Gallienae Auguſtae,</hi>
               <hi>Pax Ubique,</hi> and was ſtamp'd at a time
when the Emperor's Father was in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and the Empire torn in Pieces by
ſeveral Pretenders to it. Yet, if one
conſiders the ſtrange Stupidity of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
with the ſenſeleſs Security which
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0168900800:225"/>
appears in ſeveral of his Sayings that are
ſtill left on Record, one may very well
believe this Coin was of his own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
We may be ſure, if Raillery had
once enter'd the old <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, we
ſhould have been over-ſtock'd with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
of that Nature; if we conſider
there were often Rival Emperors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
at the ſame time, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
at the leſſening of each others
Character, and that moſt of 'em were
ſucceeded by ſuch as were Enemies to
their Predeceſſor. Theſe Medals of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>
were never current Mony, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Nature of Medalions, which
ſeem to have been made on purpoſe to
perpetuate the Diſcoveries of that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Society. <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us, that
their monſtrous Inventions were Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd

an Opportunity of ſeeing many things
in a Road which our Voyage-Writers

It is indeed much eaſier to trace out the

becauſe <hi>Virgil</hi> has mark'd it out by

The Extremity of this Cape has
a long Cleft in it, which was enlarg'd

made this the great Port for the <hi>Roman</hi>

            <p>There are ſtill to be ſeen a few Ruins

Antiquity of the Place is a Sett of
Galleries that are hewn into the Rock,
and are much more ſpacious than the
<hi>Piſcina Mirabilis.</hi> Some will have them
to have been a Reſervoir of Water,
but others more probably ſuppoſe them
to have been <hi>Nero</hi>'s Baths. I lay the
firſt Night on the Iſle of <hi>Procita,</hi> which
is pretty well cultivated, and contains
about Four Thouſand Inhabitants, who
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0168900800:231"/>

            </p>
            <p>The next Morning I went to ſee the
Iſle of <hi>Iſchia,</hi> that ſtands further out
into the Sea. The ancient Poets call
it <hi>Inarime,</hi> and lay <hi>Typhaeus</hi> under it, by
reaſon of its Eruptions of Fire. There
has been no Eruption for near theſe
Three Hundred Years. The laſt was
very terrible, and deſtroy'd a whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
At preſent there are ſcarce any Marks
left of a Subterraneous Fire, for the Earth
is cold, and over-run with Graſs and
Shrubs, where the Rocks will ſuffer it.
There are indeed ſeveral little Cracks in
it, thro' which there iſſues a conſtant
Smoke, but 'tis probable this ariſes from
the warm Springs that feed the many
Baths with which this Iſland is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſtock'd. I obſerv'd, about one of
theſe Breathing Paſſages, a Spot of Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
that flouriſh within the Steam of
theſe Vapours, and have a continual
Moiſture hanging upon them. On the
South of <hi>Iſchia</hi> lyes a round Lake of
about Three Quarters of a Mile Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſeparate from the Sea by a narrow
Tract of Land. It was formerly a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Port. On the North End of the
Iſland ſtands the Town and Caſtle, on
an exceeding high Rock, divided from
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0168900800:232"/>
the Body of the Iſland, and inacceſſible
to an Enemy on all Sides. This Iſland
is larger, but much more Rocky and
Barren than <hi>Procita. Virgil</hi> makes them
both ſhake at the Fall of part of the
Mole of <hi>Bajae,</hi> that ſtood at a few Miles

            <p>Among other Subterraneous Works
there is the beginning of a Paſſage,
which is ſtopp'd up within leſs than a
Hundred Yards of the Entrance, by
the Earth that is fallen into it. They
ſuppoſe it to have been the other Mouth
of the <hi>Sibyl</hi>'s Grotto. It lyes indeed in
the ſame Line with the Entrance near
the <hi>Avernus,</hi> is fac'd alike with the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0168900800:237"/>

probable, that it was once inhabited
by ſuch as perhaps thought it a better

made with ſmaller Trouble and Expence.

            <p>I ſaw at <hi>Cajeta</hi> the Rock of Marble,
ſaid to be cleft by an Earthquake at our

every one who ſees this vaſt Rent
in ſo high a Rock, and obſerves how
exactly the Convex Parts of one Side
tally with the Concave of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
muſt be ſatisfy'd that it was the
Effect of an Earthquake, tho' I queſtion
not but it either happen'd long before
the Time of the <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, or in
the darker Ages ſince, for otherwiſe. I
cannot but think they would have taken
notice of its Original. The Port, Town,
Caſtle, and Antiquities of this Place
have been often deſcrib'd.</p>
            <p>We touch'd next at <hi>Monte Circeio</hi>
which <hi>Homer</hi> calls <hi>Inſula Aeëa,</hi> whether
it be that it was formerly an Iſland, or
that the <hi>Greek</hi> Sailors of his Time thought
it ſo. It is certain they might eaſily
have been deceived by its appearance, as
being a very high Mountain join'd to
the main Land by a narrow Tract of
Earth, that is many Miles in Length, and
almoſt of a Level with the Surface of
the Water. The End of this Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
is very rocky, and mightily expos'd
to the Winds and Waves, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
gave the firſt Riſe to the Howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Wolves, and the Roarings of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,
that us'd to be heard thence. This
I had a very lively Idea of, being forc'd
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0168900800:240"/>
to lye under it a whole Night. <hi>Virgil</hi>'s
Deſcription of <hi>Aeneas</hi> paſſing by this
Coaſt can never be enough admir'd. It
is worth while to obſerve how, to heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the Horror of the Deſcription, he
has prepar'd the Reader's Mind, by the
Solemnity of <hi>Cajeta</hi>'s Funeral, and the
dead Stillneſs of the Night.<q>

               <hi>Virgil</hi> calls this Promontory <hi>Aeëae In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula
Circes</hi> in the Third <hi>Aeneid,</hi> but 'tis
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0168900800:243"/>
the Heroe, and not the Poet that ſpeaks.
It may however be look'd upon as an
Intimation, that he himſelf thought it
an Iſland in <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Time. As for the
thick Woods, which not only <hi>Virgil</hi>
but <hi>Homer</hi> mentions, in the beautiful
Deſcription that <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Longinus</hi>
have taken notice of, they are moſt of
'em grubb'd up ſince the Promontory
has been cultivated and inhabited, tho'
there are ſtill many Spots of it which
ſhow the natural Inclination of the Soil
leans that way.</p>
            <p>The next Place we touch'd upon was
<hi>Nettuno,</hi> where we found nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
beſides the extream Poverty
and Lazineſs of the Inhabitans. At Two
Miles diſtance from it lye the Ruins of
<hi>Antium,</hi> that are ſpread over a great
Circuit of Land. There are ſtill left the
Foundations of ſeveral Buildings, and
what are always the laſt Parts that periſh
in a Ruin, many Subterraneous Grotto's
and Paſſages of a great Length. The
Foundations of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Port are ſtill to
be ſeen. It was altogether Artificial,
and compos'd of huge Moles running
round it, in a kind of Circular Figure,
except where the Ships were to enter,
and had about Three Quarters of a Mile
in its ſhorteſt Diameter. Tho' the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0168900800:244"/>
of this Port muſt have coſt prodigious
Sums of Mony, we find no Medal of it,
and yet the ſame Emperor has a Medal
ſtruck in his own Name for the Port of
<hi>Oſtia,</hi> which in Reality was a Work of
his Predeceſſor <hi>Claudius.</hi> The laſt Pope
was at conſiderable Charges to make a
little kind of Harbour in this Place, and
to convey freſh Water to it, which was
one of the Artifices of the Grand Duke,
to divert his Holineſs from his Project
of making <hi>Civita-vecchia</hi> a free Port.
There lyes between <hi>Antium</hi> and <hi>Nettu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>
a Cardinal's <hi>Villa,</hi> which is one of
the pleaſanteſt for Walks, Fountains,
Shades, and Proſpects that I ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antium</hi> was formerly famous for the
Temple of Fortune that ſtod in it. All
agree there were Two Fortunes worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
here, which <hi>Suetonius</hi> calls the <hi>Fortunae
Antiates,</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi> the <hi>Sorores Antii.</hi>
Some are of Opinion, that by theſe Two
Goddeſſes were meant the Two <hi>Nemeſes</hi>
one of which rewarded good Men, as
the other puniſh'd the wicked. <hi>Fabretti</hi>
and others are apt to believe, that by
the Two Fortunes were only meant in
general the Goddeſs who ſent Proſperity,
or ſhe who ſent Afflictions to Mankind,
and produce in their Behalf an ancient
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0168900800:245"/>
Monument found in this very Place, and
ſuperſcrib'd <hi>Fortunae Felici,</hi> which indeed
may favour one Opinion as well as the
other, and ſhows at leaſt they are not
miſtaken in the general Senſe of their
Diviſion. I don't know whether any
Body has taken notice, that this double
Function of the Goddeſs gives a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Light and Beauty to the Ode
which <hi>Horace</hi> has addreſs'd to her. The
whole Poem is a Prayer to Fortune, that
ſhe would proſper <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Arms, and
confound his Enemies, ſo that each of
the Goddeſſes has her Task aſſign'd in
the Poet's Prayer; and we may obſerve
the Invocation is divided between the
Two Deities, the firſt Line relating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
to either. That which I have
mark'd ſpeaks to the Goddeſs of Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or if you pleaſe to the <hi>Nemeſis</hi> of
the Good, and the other to the Goddeſs
of Adverſity, or to the <hi>Nemeſis</hi> of the
Wicked.<q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is generally obſerv'd, that
Modern <hi>Rome</hi> ſtands higher
than the Ancient; ſome have
computed it about Fourteen
or Fifteen Feet, taking one
Place with another. The Reaſon given
for it is, that the preſent City ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ruins of the former, and indeed
I have often obſerved, that where any
conſiderable Pile of Building ſtood an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
one ſtill finds a riſing Ground,
or a little kind of Hill, which was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
made up out of the Fragments and
Rubbiſh of the ruin'd Edifice. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this particular Cauſe, we may aſſign
another that has very much contributed
to the raiſing the Situation of ſeveral
Parts of <hi>Rome</hi>: It being certain the great
Quantities of Earth, that have been
waſh'd off from the Hills by the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Showers, have had no ſmall
ſhare in it. This any one may be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of who obſerves how far ſeveral
Buildings, that ſtand near the Roots of
Mountains, are ſunk deeper in the Earth
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0168900800:252"/>
than thoſe that have been on the Tops
of Hills, or in open Plains; for which
Reaſon the preſent Face of <hi>Rome</hi> is much
more Even and Level than it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
the ſame Cauſe that has rais'd
the lower Grounds having contributed
to ſink thoſe that were higher.</p>
            <p>There are in <hi>Rome</hi> Two Setts of
Antiquities, the Chriſtian and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
The former, tho' of a freſher
Date, are ſo embroil'd with Fable and
Legend, that one receives but little Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
from ſearching into them. The
other give a great deal of Pleaſure to
ſuch as have met with them before in
ancient Authors; for a Man who is in
<hi>Rome</hi> can ſcarce ſee an Object that does
not call to Mind a Piece of a <hi>Latin</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
or Hiſtorian. Among the Remains
of Old <hi>Rome,</hi> the Grandeur of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
ſhows it ſelf chiefly in Works
that were either neceſſary or convenient,
ſuch as Temples, High-ways, Aqueducts,
Walls and Bridges of the City. On
the contrary the Magnificence of <hi>Rome,</hi>
under the Emperors, is ſeen principally
in ſuch Works as were rather for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation
or Luxury, than any real Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
or Neceſſity, as in Baths, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheaters,
Circus's, Obelisks, Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Pillars, Arches and Mauſoleums;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0168900800:253"/>
for what they added to the Aqueducts
was rather to ſupply their Baths and Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machias,
and to embelliſh the City with
Fountains, than out of any real Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
there was for them. Theſe ſeveral
Remains have been ſo copiouſly deſcrib'd
by abundance of Travellers, and other
Writers, particularly by thoſe concern'd
in the learned Collection of <hi>Graevius,</hi> that
it is very difficult to make any new Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
on ſo beaten a Subject. There
is however ſo much to be obſerv'd in ſo
ſpacious a Field of Antiquities, that it
is almoſt impoſſible to ſurvey them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking new Hints, and raiſing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Reflections, according as a Mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Turn of Thoughts, or the Courſe
of his Studies, direct him.</p>
            <p>No Part of the Antiquities of <hi>Rome</hi>
pleas'd me ſo much as the ancient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
of which there is ſtill an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Variety. The Workmanſhip is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the moſt exquiſite of any thing in
its kind. A Man would wonder how
it were poſſible for ſo much Life to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into Marble, as may be diſcover'd in
ſome of the beſt of them; and even in
the meaneſt one has the Satisfaction of
ſeeing the Faces, Poſtures, Airs and
Dreſs of thoſe that have liv'd ſo many
Ages before us. There is a ſtrange Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0168900800:254"/>
between the Figures of the
ſeveral Heathen Deities, and the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
that the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets have given
us of them; but as the firſt may be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as the ancienter of the Two, I
queſtion not but the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets were
the Copiers of the <hi>Greek</hi> Statuaries.
Tho' on other Occaſions we often find
the Statuaries took their Subjects from
the Poets. The <hi>Laocoon</hi> is too known
an Inſtance among many others that are
to be met with at <hi>Rome.</hi> In the <hi>Villa
Aldabrandina</hi> are the Figures of an Old
and Young Man, engag'd together at
the <hi>Caeſtus,</hi> who are probably the <hi>Dares</hi>
and <hi>Entellus</hi> of <hi>Virgil</hi>; where by the
way one may obſerve the Make of the
ancient <hi>Caeſtus,</hi> that it only conſiſted of
ſo many large Thongs about the Hand,
without any thing like a Piece of Lead at
the End of them, as ſome Writers of
Antiquities have falſely imagin'd.</p>
            <p>I queſtion not but many Paſſages in
the old Poets hint at ſeveral Parts of
Sculpture, that were in Vogue in the
Author's Time, tho' they are now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought of, and that therefore ſuch
Paſſages loſe much of their Beauty in the
Eye of a Modern Reader, who does not
look upon them in the ſame Light with
the Author's Contemporaries. I ſhall

was not anciently ſo great an Hyperbole
as it is now, for I have ſeen old <hi>Roman</hi>
Rings ſo very thick about, and with ſuch
large Stones in 'em, that 'tis no Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p>It is certain that Satyr delights in ſuch
Alluſions and Inſtances as are extreamly
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0168900800:259"/>
natural and familiar: When therefore
we ſee any thing in an old Satyriſt that
looks forc'd and pedantick, we ought to
conſider how it appear'd in the Time
the Poet writ, and whether or no there
might not be ſome particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to recommend it to the Readers
of his own Age, which we are now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of. One of the fineſt ancient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
in <hi>Rome</hi> is a <hi>Meleager</hi> with a Spear
in his Hand, and the Head of a Wild
Boar on one Side of him. It is of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Marble, and as yellow as Ivory. One
meets with many other Figures of <hi>Mele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager</hi>
in the ancient <hi>Baſſo Relievo's,</hi> and
on the Sides of the <hi>Sarcophagi,</hi> or Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Monuments. Perhaps it was the Arms
or Device of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Hunters;
which Conjecture I have found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in a Paſſage of <hi>Manilius,</hi> that lets
us know the Pagan Hunters had <hi>Melea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>

               <hi>Juvenal</hi> here deſcribes the Simplicity
of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers, and the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
that were generally Engraven on
their Helmets. The Firſt of 'em was
the Wolf giving Suck to <hi>Romulus</hi> and
<hi>Rhemus</hi>: The Second, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in the Two laſt Verſes, is not
ſo Intelligible. Some of the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
tell us, that the God here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
is <hi>Mars,</hi> that he comes to ſee his
Two Sons ſucking the Wolf, and that
the old Sculptors generally drew their
Figures naked, that they might have the
Advantage of repreſenting the different
Swelling of the Muſcles, and the Turns
of the Body. But they are extremely
at a Loſs to know what is meant by the
Word <hi>Pendentis</hi>; ſome fancy it expreſſes
only the great Emboſsment of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
others believe it hung off the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
in <hi>Alto Relievo,</hi> as in the foregoing
Tranſlation. <hi>Lubin</hi> ſuppoſes that the
God <hi>Mars</hi> was Engraven on the Shield,
and that he is ſaid to be hanging, becauſe
the Shield which bore him hung on the
Left Shoulder. One of the old Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
is of Opinion, that by hanging
is only meant a Poſture of bending for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to ſtrike the Enemy. Another will
have it, that whatever is placed on the
Head may be ſaid to hang, as we call
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0168900800:263"/>
hanging Gardens, ſuch as are planted on
the Top of the Houſe. Several learned
Men, who like none of theſe Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
believe there has been a Fault in
the Tranſcriber, and that <hi>Pendentis</hi> ought
to be <hi>Perdentis</hi>; but they quote no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript
in Favour of their Conjecture.
The true Meaning of the Words is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
as follows. The <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers,
who were not a little proud of their
Founder, and the Military Genius of
their Republick, us'd to bear on their
Helmets the Firſt Hiſtory of <hi>Romulus,</hi>
who was begot by the God of War, and
ſuckled by a Wolf. The Figure of the
God was made as if deſcending upon the
Prieſteſs <hi>Ilia,</hi> or as others call her <hi>Rhea
Silvia.</hi> The Occaſion required his Body
ſhould be naked,
<q>
                  <l>Tu quoque inermis eras cum te formoſa Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos</l>
                  <l>Cepit: ut huic urbi Semina magna dares.</l>
                  <bibl>Ov. de Faſ. L. 3.</bibl>
                  <l>Then too, our mighty Sire, thou ſtood'ſt
diſarm'd,</l>
                  <l>When thy rapt Soul the lovely Prieſteſs
charm'd,</l>
                  <l>That <hi>Rome</hi>'s high Founder bore—</l>
               </q>

               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0168900800:264"/>
tho' on other Occaſions he is drawn, as
<hi>Horace</hi> has deſcrib'd him, <hi>Tunicâ cinctum
adamantinâ.</hi> The Sculptor however, to
diſtinguiſh him from the reſt of the Gods,
gave him what the Medalliſts call his
proper Attributes, a Spear in one Hand,
and a Shield in the other. As he was
repreſented deſcending, his Figure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
ſuſpended in the Air over the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal
Virgin, in which Senſe the Word
<hi>Pendentis</hi> is extremely proper and Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
Beſides the Antique <hi>Baſſo Relievo,</hi>
that made me firſt think of this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
I have ſince met with the ſame
Figures on the Reverſes of a couple of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Coins, which were ſtamp'd in the
Reign of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> as a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to that Emperor, whom for his
Excellent Government and Conduct of
the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Senate regarded
as a Second kind of Founder.

Groupe of Figures, which repreſents the
Two Brothers binding <hi>Dirce</hi> to the Horns

            <p>I could not forbear taking particular
notice of the ſeveral Muſical Inſtruments,
that are to be ſeen in the Hands of the
<hi>Apollo's,</hi> Muſes, Fauns, Satyrs, Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais
and Shepherds, which might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
give a great Light to the Diſpute
for Preference between the Ancient and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0168900800:268"/>
Modern Muſick. It would perhaps be
no impertinent deſign to take off all their
Models in Wood, which might not only
give us ſome Notion of the ancient Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
but help us to pleaſanter Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than are now in uſe. By the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
they make in Marble, there is
not One String-Inſtrument that ſeems
comparable to our Violins, for they are
all play'd on, either by the bare Fingers,
or the <hi>Plectrum,</hi> ſo that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of adding any length to their
Notes, or of varying 'em by thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
Swellings, and wearings away of
Sound upon the ſame String, which give
ſo wonderful a Sweetneſs to our Modern
Muſick. Beſides, that the String-Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
muſt have had very low and feeble
Voices, as may be gueſs'd from the ſmall
Proportion of Wood about 'em, which
could not contain Air enough to render
the Strokes, in any conſiderable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
full and ſonorous. There is a great
deal of difference in the Make, not only
of the ſeveral kinds of Inſtruments, but
even among thoſe of the ſame Name.
The <hi>Syringa,</hi> for Example, has ſometimes
Four, and ſometimes more Pipes, as high
as to Twelve. The ſame Variety of
Strings may be obſerved on their Harps,
and of Stops on their <hi>Tibiae,</hi> which ſhows
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0168900800:269"/>
the little Foundation that ſuch Writers
have gone upon, who from a Verſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Eclogues, or a ſhort Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
in a <hi>Claſſic</hi> Author, have been ſo
very nice in determining the preciſe Shape
of the ancient Muſical Inſtruments, with
the exact Number of their Pipes, Strings
and Stops. It is indeed the uſual Fault
of the Writers of Antiquities, to ſtreighten
and confine themſelves to particular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.
They are for making a kind of
Stamp on every thing of the ſame Name,
and if they find any thing like an old De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Subject they Treat on,
they take care to regulate it on all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
according to the Figure it makes
in ſuch a ſingle Paſſage: As the learned
<hi>German</hi> Author, quoted by Monſieur
<hi>Baudelot,</hi> who had probably never ſeen
any thing of a Houſhold-God, more than
a <hi>Canopus,</hi> affirms roundly, that all the
ancient <hi>Lares</hi> were made in the Faſhion
of a Jug-Bottle. In ſhort, the Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
have been guilty of the ſame Fault
as the Syſteme-Writers, who are for
cramping their Subjects into as narrow a
Space as they can, and for reducing the
whole Extent of a Science into a few
general Maxims. This a Man has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of obſerving more than once, in the
ſeveral Fragments of Antiquity that are
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0168900800:270"/>
ſtill to be ſeen in <hi>Rome.</hi> How many
Dreſſes are there for each particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity?
What a Variety of Shapes in the
ancient Urns, Lamps, Lachrymary Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
<hi>Priapus's,</hi> Houſhold-Gods, which
have ſome of 'em been repreſented under
ſuch a particular Form, as any one of 'em
has been deſcrib'd with in an ancient
Author, and would probably be all ſo,
were they not ſtill to be ſeen in their
own Vindication? Madam <hi>Dacier,</hi> from
ſome old Cuts of <hi>Terence,</hi> fancies that the
<hi>Larva</hi> or <hi>Perſona</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Actors,
was not only a Vizard for the Face, but
had falſe Hair to it, and came over the
whole Head like a Helmet. Among all
the Statues at <hi>Rome,</hi> I remember to have
ſeen but Two that are the Figures of
Actors, which are both in the <hi>Villa Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thei.</hi>
One ſees on 'em the Faſhion of
the old Sock and <hi>Larva,</hi> the latter of
which anſwers the Deſcription that is
given of it by this learned Lady, tho' I
queſtion not but ſeveral others were in
uſe; for I have ſeen the Figure of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
the Comic Muſe, ſometimes with
an entire Head-piece in her Hand, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with about half the Head, and a
little Friz, like a Tower, running round
the Edges of the Face, and ſometimes
with a Mask for the Face only, like thoſe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0168900800:271"/>
of a Modern Make. Some of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>

            <p>In the <hi>Villa Borgheſe</hi> is the Buſt of
a young <hi>Nero,</hi> which ſhows us the Form
of an ancient <hi>Bulla</hi> on the Breaſt, which
is neither like a Heart, as <hi>Macrobius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
it, nor altogether reſembles that
in Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi>'s Cabinet; ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
eſtabliſhing a particular Inſtance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a general Rule, we ought, in Subjects
of this Nature, to leave room for the
Humour of the Artiſt or Wearer. There
are many Figures of Gladiators at <hi>Rome,</hi>
tho' I don't remember to have ſeen any
of the <hi>Retiarius,</hi> the <hi>Samnite,</hi> or the
Antagoniſt to the <hi>Pinnirapus.</hi> But what
I could not find among the Statues, I
met with in Two Antique Pieces of
Moſaic, which are in the Poſſeſſion of
a Cardinal. The <hi>Retiarius</hi> is engag'd
with the <hi>Samnite,</hi> and has had ſo lucky
a Throw, that his Net covers the whole
Body of his Adverſary from Head to
Foot, yet his Antagoniſt recover'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
out of the Toiles, and was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0168900800:273"/>
according to the Inſcription.
In another Piece is repreſented the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
of the <hi>Pinnirapus,</hi> who is arm'd
like the <hi>Samnite,</hi> and not like the <hi>Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arius,</hi>
as ſome learned Men have ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
On the Helmet of his Antagoniſt
are ſeen the Two <hi>Pinnae,</hi> that ſtand up
on either Side like the Wings in the
<hi>Petaſus</hi> of a <hi>Mercury,</hi> but riſe much
higher, and are more pointed.</p>
            <p>There is no part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
that we are better acquainted
with, than what relates to their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.
For as the Old <hi>Romans</hi> were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much devoted to their Religion, we
ſee ſeveral Parts of it entering their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Baſſo Relievo's,</hi> Statues and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
not to mention their Altars, Tombs,
Monuments, and thoſe particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of Architecture which were
borrow'd from it. An Heathen Ritual
could not inſtruct a Man better than theſe
ſeveral Pieces of Antiquity, in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Ceremonies and Punctilio's that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the different kinds of Sacrifices.
Yet there is a much greater Variety in
the Make of the Sacrificing Inſtruments,
than one finds in thoſe who have Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of them, or have given us their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.
For not to inſiſt too long on
ſuch a Subject, I ſaw in Signior <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio

Politi</hi>'s Collection a <hi>Patera</hi> without

Engraven, and another with a

tho' it is quite contrary to any that I
have ever ſeen cut in Marble; and I

I might here enlarge on the Shape of
the Triumphal Chariot, which is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

I could never diſcover the ſeveral diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>Roman</hi> Garments, for 'tis very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to Trace out the Figure of a Veſt,
thro' all the Plaits and Foldings of the
Drapery; beſides, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
did not differ from each other,
ſo much by the Shape as by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery
and Colour, the one of which
was too nice for the Statuary's Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the other does not lye within
the Expreſſion of the Chiſſel. I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
in abundance of <hi>Bas Reliefs,</hi> that
the <hi>Cinctus Gabinus</hi> is nothing elſe but
a long Garment, not unlike a Surplice,
which would have trail'd on the Ground
had it hung looſe, and was therefore ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
about the middle with a Girdle.
After this it is worth while to read the
laborious Deſcription that <hi>Ferrarius</hi> has
made of it. <q>Cinctus Gabinus non aliud
fuit quàm cum togae lacinia laevo brachio
ſubducta in tergum ita rejiciebatur, ut

Armour, ſeems drawn out of the

a Statue, which was dug up at <hi>Rome,</hi>
dreſs'd in this kind of Armour, gives a

Hands, or for ſome other Reaſon, it is
ſaid that the Prince <hi>Farneſe,</hi> who is the
preſent Owner of this Seat, will keep
it from being turn'd up 'till he ſees one
of his own Family in the Chair. There
are Undertakers in <hi>Rome</hi> who often pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
the digging of Fields, Gardens,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0168900800:279"/>
or Vineyards, where they find any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
of ſucceeding, and ſome have
been known to arrive at great Eſtates by
it. They pay according to the Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the Surface they are to break
up, and after having made Eſſays into
it, as they do for Coal in <hi>England,</hi> they
rake into the moſt promiſing Parts of
it, tho' they often find, to their Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
that others have been before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
with 'em. However they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
gain enough by the Rubbiſh and
Bricks, which the preſent Architects va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
much beyond thoſe of a Modern
Make, to defray the Charges of their
Search. I was ſhown Two Spaces of
Ground, where part of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Golden
Houſe ſtood, for which the Owner has
been offer'd an extraordinary Sum of
Mony. What encourag'd the Undertakers
are ſeveral very ancient Trees, which
grow upon the Spot, from whence they
conclude that theſe particular Tracts of
Ground muſt have lain untouch'd for
ſome Ages. 'Tis pity there is not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like a publick Regiſter, to preſerve
the Memory of ſuch Statues as have been
found from time to time, and to mark
the particular Places where they have
been taken up, which would not only
prevent many fruitleſs Searches for the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0168900800:280"/>
future, but might often give a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Light into the Quality of the Place,
or the Deſign of the Statue.</p>
            <p>But the great Magazine for all kinds
of Treaſure is ſuppoſed to be the Bed of
the <hi>Tiber.</hi> We may be ſure, when the
<hi>Romans</hi> lay under the Apprehenſions of
ſeeing their City ſack'd by a barbarous
Enemy, as they have done more than
once, that they would take care to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
ſuch of their Riches this way as
could beſt bear the Water: beſides what
the Inſolence of a Brutiſh Conqueror
may be ſuppoſed to have contributed, who
had an Ambition to waſte and deſtroy all
the Beauties of ſo celebrated a City. I
need not mention the old Common-ſhore
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ran from all Parts of
the Town with the Current and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of an ordinary River, nor the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Inundations of the <hi>Tiber,</hi> which
may have ſwept away many of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of its Banks, nor the ſeveral
Statues that the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves flung
into it, when they would revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on the Memory of an ill Citizen,
a dead Tyrant, or a Diſcarded Favourite.
At <hi>Rome</hi> they have ſo general an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Riches of this River, that the
<hi>Jews</hi> have formerly proffer'd the Pope
to cleanſe it, ſo they might have, for
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0168900800:281"/>
their Pains, what they found in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
of it. I have ſeen the Valley near
<hi>Ponte molle,</hi> which they propos'd to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
into a new Channel for it, 'till they
had clear'd the old for its Reception.
The Pope however would not comply
with the Propoſal, as fearing the Heats
might advance too far before they had
finiſhed their Work, and produce a Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
among his People; tho' I don't
ſee why ſuch a Deſign might not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
now with as little Danger as in
<hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Time, were there as many
Hands employ'd upon it. The City of
<hi>Rome</hi> would receive a great Advantage
from the Undertaking, as it would raiſe
the Banks and deepen the Bed of the
<hi>Tiber,</hi> and by Conſequence free 'em from
thoſe frequent Inundations to which
they are ſo ſubject at preſent; for the
Channel of the River is obſerved to be
narrower within the Walls, than either
below or above them.</p>
            <p>Before I quit this Subject of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
I think it very obſervable, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe which are already found there
ſhould be ſo many not only of the ſame
Perſons, but made after the ſame Deſign.
One would not indeed wonder to ſee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Figures of particular Deities and
Emperors, who had a Multitude of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0168900800:282"/>
erected to 'em, and had their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sets of Worſhippers and Admirers.
Thus <hi>Ceres,</hi> the moſt beneficent and
uſeful of the Heathen Divinities, has
more Statues than any other of the Gods
or Goddeſſes, as ſeveral of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empereſſes took a Pleaſure to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
in her Dreſs. And I believe
one finds as many Figures of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> as of all
the reſt together; becauſe the <hi>Romans</hi>
had ſo great a Veneration for his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that it grew into a part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to preſerve a Statue of him in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every private Family. But how
comes it to paſs, that ſo many of theſe
Statues are cut after the very ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
and not only of theſe, but of ſuch
as had no Relation, either to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
or Devotion of the Owner, as the
dying <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> the Faune
leaning againſt the Trunk of a Tree, the
Boy with the Bird in his Hand, the <hi>Leda</hi>
and her Swan, with many others of the
ſame Nature. I muſt confeſs I always
look upon Figures of this kind, as the
Copies of ſome celebrated Maſter-piece,
and queſtion not but they were famous
Originals, that gave Riſe to the ſeveral
Statues which we ſee with the ſame Air,
Poſture, and Attitudes: What confirms
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0168900800:283"/>
me in this Conjecture, there are many
ancient Statues of the <hi>Venus de Medicis,</hi>
the <hi>Silenus</hi> with the young <hi>Bacchus</hi> in
his Arms, the <hi>Hercules Farneſe,</hi> the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinöus,</hi>
and other beautiful Originals of
the Ancients, that are already drawn
out of the Rubbiſh, where they lay
conceal'd for ſo many Ages. Among
the reſt I have obſerved more that are
form'd after the Deſign of the <hi>Venus</hi> of
<hi>Medicis</hi> than of any other, from whence
I believe one may conclude, that it was the
moſt celebrated Statue among the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
as well as among the Moderns. It has
always been uſual for Sculptors to work
upon the beſt Models, as it is for thoſe that
are Curious to have Copies of them.</p>
            <p>I am apt to think ſomething of the
ſame Account may be given of the
Reſemblance that we meet with in many
of the Antique <hi>Baſſo Relievo's.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I was very well pleaſed with
the Device of one that I met with on
the Tomb of a young <hi>Roman</hi> Lady,
which had beem made for her by her
Mother. The Sculptor had choſen the
Rape of <hi>Proſerpine</hi> for his Device, where
in one End you might ſee the God of
the Dead (<hi>Pluto</hi>) hurrying away a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
young Virgin, (<hi>Proſerpine</hi>) and at
the other the Grief and Diſtraction of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0168900800:284"/>
the Mother (<hi>Ceres</hi>) on that Occaſion. I
have ſince obſerved the ſame Device up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſeveral <hi>Sarcophagi,</hi> that have enclos'd
the Aſhes of Men or Boys, Maids or
Matrons; for when the Thought took,
tho' at firſt it received its Riſe from
ſuch a particular Occaſion as I have
mention'd, the Ignorance of the Sculptors
apply'd it promiſcuouſly. I know there
are Authors who diſcover a Myſtery in
this Device.</p>
            <p>A Man is ſometimes ſurprized to find
ſo many extravagant Fancies as are cut
on the old Pagan Tombs. Masks, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-matches,
and Bacchanals are very
common; ſometimes one meets with a
lewd Figure of a <hi>Priapus,</hi> and in the
<hi>Villa Pamphilia</hi> is ſeen a Satyr coupling
with a Goat. There are however many
of a more ſerious Nature, that ſhadow
out the Exiſtence of the Soul after
Death, and the Hopes of a happy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.
I cannot leave the <hi>Baſſo Relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo's</hi>
without mentioning one of 'em,
where the Thought is extreamly noble.
It is call'd <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Apotheoſis,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of a Groupe of Figures cut in the
ſame Block of Marble, and riſing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
another by Four or Five different
Aſcents. <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſits at the Top of it
with a Thunderbolt in his Hand, and,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0168900800:285"/>

<hi>Homer</hi> himſelf is placed at one End of
the loweſt Row, ſitting in a Chair of
State, which is ſupported on each Side
by the Figure of a kneeling Woman.
The one holds a Sword in her Hand to
repreſent the <hi>Iliad,</hi> or Actions of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>

About the Poet's Feet are creeping a

and putting a Garland on the
Poet's Head, to intimate the mighty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
he has gain'd in all Ages, and

This Antique Piece of Sculpture
is in the Poſſeſſion of the Conſtable <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna,</hi>
but never ſhown to thoſe who ſee
the Palace, unleſs they particularly deſire it.</p>
            <p>Among the great Variety of ancient
Coins which I ſaw at <hi>Rome,</hi> I could not
but take particular notice of ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to any of the Buildings or Statues
that are ſtill Extant. Thoſe of the
Firſt kind have been already publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Writers of the <hi>Roman</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities,
and may be moſt of them
met with in the laſt Edition of <hi>Donatus,</hi>
as the Pillars of <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Antonine,</hi> the
Arches of <hi>Druſus Germanicus,</hi> and <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timius
Severus,</hi> the Temples of <hi>Janus,</hi>
               <hi>Concord, Veſta, Jupiter tonans, Apollo</hi>
and <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> the <hi>Circus Maximus, Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi>
and that of <hi>Caracalla,</hi> or, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Fabretti,</hi> of <hi>Galienus,</hi> of <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>'s
Amphitheater, and <hi>Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>'s
Baths; tho', I muſt confeſs, the
Subject of the laſt may be very well
doubted of. As for the <hi>Meta ſudans</hi>
and <hi>Pons Aelius,</hi> which have gain'd a
Place among the Buildings that are now
ſtanding, and to be met with on old
Reverſes of Medals: The Coin that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0168900800:287"/>
ſhows the firſt is generally rejected as
ſpurious: nor is the other, tho' cited in the
laſt Edition of Monſieur <hi>Vaillant,</hi> eſteem'd
more Authentick by the preſent <hi>Roman</hi>
Medalliſts, who are certainly the moſt
skilful in the World, as to the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Part of this Science. I ſhall cloſe
up this Set of Medals with a very Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
one, as large as a Medalion, that
is ſingular in its kind. On one Side is
the Head of the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> the
Reverſe has on it the <hi>Circus Maximus,</hi>
and a View of the Side of the <hi>Palatine</hi>
Mountain that faces it, on which are
ſeen ſeveral Edifices, and among the reſt
the famous Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> that has
ſtill a conſiderable Ruin ſtanding. This
Medal I ſaw in the Hands of Monſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur
<hi>Strozzi,</hi> Brother to the Duke of
that Name, who has many Curioſities
in his Poſſeſſion, and is very obliging to
a Stranger who deſires the Sight of
'em. It is a ſurpriſing thing; that among
the great Pieces of Architecture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
on the old Coins, one can never
meet with the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> the <hi>Mauſolaeum</hi>
of <hi>Auguſtus, Nero</hi>'s Golden Houſe, the
<hi>Moles Adriani,</hi> the <hi>Septizonium</hi> of <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
the Baths of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> &amp;c. But
ſince it was the Cuſtom of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperors thus to Regiſter their moſt
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0168900800:288"/>
remarkable Buildings, as well as Actions,
and ſince there are ſeveral in either of
theſe kinds not to be found on Medals,
more extraordinary than thoſe that are;
we may, I think, with great Reaſon
ſuſpect our Collections of old Coins to
be extremely deficient, and that thoſe
which are already found out ſcarce bear
a Proportion to what are yet undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.
A Man takes a great deal more
Pleaſure in ſurveying the ancient Statues,
who compares them with Medals, than
it is poſſible for him to do without ſome
little Knowledge this way; for theſe
Two Arts illuſtrate each other; and as
there are ſeveral Particulars in Hiſtory
and Antiquities which receive a great
Light from ancient Coins, ſo would it
be impoſſible to Decipher the Faces of
the many Statues that are to be ſeen at
<hi>Rome,</hi> without ſo Univerſal a Key to
them. It is this that teaches to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the Kings and Conſuls, Emperors
and Empereſſes, the Deities and Virtues,
with a Thouſand other Particulars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to Statuary, and not to be learnt
by any other Means. In the <hi>Villa Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia</hi>
ſtands the Statue of a Man in
Woman's Cloaths, which the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries
do not know what to make of,
and therefore paſs it off for an <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodite</hi>;
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0168900800:289"/>
But a learned Medalliſt
in <hi>Rome</hi> has lately fix'd it to <hi>Clodius,</hi>
who is ſo famous for having intruded into
the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>emnities of the <hi>Bona Dea</hi> in a
Woman's Habit, for one ſees the ſame
Features and Make of Face in a Medal
of the <hi>Clodian</hi> Family.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen on Coins the Four fineſt
Figures perhaps that are now Extant:
The <hi>Hercules Farneſe,</hi> the <hi>Venus</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis,</hi>
the <hi>Apollo</hi> in the <hi>Belvidere,</hi> and
the famous <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back.
The oldeſt Medal that the Firſt
appears upon is one of <hi>Commodus,</hi> the
Second on one of <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> the Third
on one of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> and the laſt
on one of <hi>Lucius Verus.</hi> We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
I think, from hence, that theſe
Statues were extremely celebrated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the old <hi>Romans,</hi> or they would
never have been honoured with a Place
among the Emperor's Coins. We may
further obſerve, that all Four of 'em
make their firſt Appearance in the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine</hi>
Family, for which Reaſon I am apt
to think they are all of them the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of that Age. They would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
have been mentioned by <hi>Pliny</hi> the
Naturaliſt, who liv'd in the next Reign,
ſave one, before <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> had they
been made in his Time. As for the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0168900800:290"/>
Brazen Figure of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> on
Horſeback, there is no doubt of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Age, tho' I muſt confeſs it
may be doubted, whether the Medal I
have cited repreſents it. All I can ſay
for it is, that the Horſe and Man on the
Medal are in the ſame Poſture as they
are on the Statue, and that there is a
Reſemblance of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>'s Face,
for I have ſeen this Reverſe on a Meda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of <hi>Don Livio</hi>'s Cabinet, and much
more diſtinctly in another very beautiful
one, that is in the Hands of Signior <hi>Marc.
Antonio.</hi> It is generally objected, that
<hi>Lucius Verus</hi> would rather have placed
the Figure of himſelf on Horſeback up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Reverſe of his own Coin, than
the Figure of <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> But it
is very well known that an Emperor
often ſtamp'd on his Coins the Face or
Ornaments of his Collegue, as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of his Reſpect or Friendſhip for
him; and we may ſuppoſe <hi>Lucius Verus</hi>
would omit no Opportunity of doing
Honour to <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> whom he
rather revered as his Father, than treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as his Partner in the Empire. The
Famous <hi>Antinous</hi> in the <hi>Belvidere</hi> muſt
have been made too about this Age, for
he dyed towards the middle of <hi>Adrian</hi>'s
Reign, the immediate Predeceſſor of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0168900800:291"/>
               <hi>Antoninus Pius.</hi> This entire Figure,
tho' not to be found in Medals, may be
ſeen in ſeveral precious Stones. Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur
<hi>La Chauſſe,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaeum
Romanum,</hi> ſhow'd me an <hi>Antinous</hi>
that he has publiſhed in his laſt Volume,
cut in a <hi>Cornelian,</hi> which he values at
Fifty Piſtoles. It repreſents him in the
Habit of a <hi>Mercury,</hi> and is the fineſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taglia</hi>
that I ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>Next to the Statues, there is nothing
in <hi>Rome</hi> more ſurpriſing than that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
variety of ancient Pillars of ſo
many kinds of Marble. As moſt of the
old Statues may be well ſuppoſed to have
been cheaper to their firſt Owners, than
they are to a Modern Purchaſer, ſeveral
of the Pillars are certainly rated at a
much lower Price at preſent than they
were of old. For not to mention what
a huge Column of <hi>Granite, Serpentine,</hi>
or <hi>Porphyry</hi> muſt have coſt in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or in its Carriage from <hi>Egypt</hi> to
<hi>Rome,</hi> we may only conſider the great
Difficulty of hewing it into any Form,
and of giving it the due Turn, Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Poliſh. It is well known how
theſe ſorts of Marble reſiſt the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of ſuch Inſtruments as are now in
uſe. There is indeed a <hi>Milaneſe</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>
who works in them, but his Advances
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0168900800:292"/>
are ſo very ſlow, that he ſcarce lives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what he gains by it. He ſhow'd me
a Piece of <hi>Porphyry</hi> work'd into an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Salver, which had coſt him Four
Months continual Application, before
he could bring it into that Form. The
Ancients had probably ſome Secret to
harden the Edges of their Tools, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
recurring to thoſe Extravagant Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of their having an Art to mollifie
the Stone, or that it was naturally ſofter
at its firſt cutting from the Rock, or
what is ſtill more abſurd, that it was an
artificial Compoſition, and not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Product of Mines and Quarries.
The moſt valuable Pillars about <hi>Rome,</hi>
for the Marble of which they are made,
are the Four Columns of Oriental Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
in St. <hi>Paulina</hi>'s Chappel at St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
Maggiore</hi>; Two of Oriental Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in St. <hi>Pudenziana</hi>; One of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent
Oriental Jaſper in the <hi>Vatican</hi>
Library; Four of <hi>Nero-Bianco</hi> in St.
<hi>Cecilia Trans-tevere</hi>; Two of <hi>Brocatel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
and Two of Oriental Agate in Don
<hi>Livio</hi>'s Palace; Two of <hi>Giallo Antico</hi> in
St. <hi>John Lateran,</hi> and Two of <hi>Verdi
Antique</hi> in the <hi>Villa Pamphilia.</hi> Theſe are
all entire and ſolid Pillars, and made of
ſuch kinds of Marble as are no where
to be found but among Antiquities, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0168900800:293"/>
it be that the Veins of it are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered,
or that they were quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
upon the ancient Buildings.
Among theſe old Pillars I cannot forbear
reckoning a great Part of an Alablaſter
Column, which was found in the Ruins
of <hi>Livia</hi>'s <hi>Portico.</hi> It is of the Colour
of Fire, and may be ſeen over the high
Altar of St. <hi>Maria</hi> in <hi>Campitello,</hi> for
they have cut it into Two Pieces, and
fix'd it in the Shape of a Croſs in a Hole
of the Wall that was made on purpoſe
to receive it; ſo that the Light paſſing
thro' it from without, makes it look,
to thoſe who are in the Church, like a
huge tranſparent Croſs of Amber. As
for the Workmanſhip of the old <hi>Roman</hi>
Pillars, Monſieur <hi>Deſgodetz,</hi> in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
Meaſures of theſe Ruins has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that the Ancients have not kept
to the nicety of Proportion, and the
Rules of Art, ſo much as the Moderns
in this Particular. Some, to excuſe this
Defect, lay the Blame of it on the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and of other Nations,
who ſent moſt of the ancient Pillars ready
ſhap'd to <hi>Rome</hi>: Others ſay that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
knowing Architecture was chiefly
deſign'd to pleaſe the Eye, only took
care to avoid ſuch Diſproportions as
were groſs enough to be obſerv'd by the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0168900800:294"/>
Sight, without minding whether or no
they approach'd to a Mathematical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs:
Others will have it rather to be
an Effect of Art, and of what the <hi>Italians,</hi>
call the <hi>Guſto grande,</hi> than of any Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in the Architect; for they ſay
the Ancients always conſider'd the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of a Building, whether it were
high or low, in an open Square or in a
narrow Street, and more or leſs devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from their Rules of Art, to comply
with the ſeveral Diſtances and Elevations
from which their Works were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.
It is ſaid there is an <hi>Ionic</hi> Pillar
in the <hi>Santa Maria Tranſtevere,</hi> where
the Marks of the Compaſs are ſtill to be
ſeen on the Volute, and that <hi>Palladio</hi>
learnt from hence the working of that
difficult Problem; but I never could find
time to examine all the old Columns
of that Church. Among the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
I muſt not paſs over the Two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
in the World, thoſe of <hi>Trajan</hi> and
<hi>Antonine.</hi> There could not have been
a more magnificent Deſign than that of
<hi>Trajan</hi>'s Pillar. Where could an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's
Aſhes have been ſo nobly lodg'd,
as in the midſt of his Metropolis, and
on the Top of ſo exalted a Monument,
with the greateſt of his Actions under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
him? Or, as ſome will have it,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0168900800:295"/>
his Statue was on the Top, his Urn at
the Foundation, and his Battles in the
midſt. The Sculpture of it is too well
known to be here mention'd. The moſt
remarkable Piece in <hi>Antonine</hi>'s Pillar is the
Figure of <hi>Jupiter Pluvius,</hi> ſending down
Rain on the fainting Army of <hi>Marcus
Aurelius,</hi> and Thunderbolts on his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which is the greateſt Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
poſſible of the Story of the Chriſtian
Legion, and will be a ſtanding Evidence
for it, when any Paſſage in an old Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
may be ſuppoſed to be forged. The
Figure that <hi>Jupiter</hi> here makes among
the Clouds, puts me in Mind of a Paſſage
in the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> which gives juſt ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Image of him. <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
are certainly to blame, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it is nothing but the Air which is
here meant by <hi>Jupiter.</hi>

It is pity the Obelisks in <hi>Rome</hi> had
not been charged with ſeveral Parts of
the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hiſtories inſtead of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogliphics,
which might have given no

that the greateſt Part of the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were taken from <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Arch,
and ſet up to the new Conqueror in no
ſmall haſte, by the Senate and People of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who were then moſt of them
Heathens. There is however ſomething
in the Inſcription, which is as old as the
Arch it ſelf, that ſeems to hint at the
Emperor's Viſion. <hi>Imp. Caeſ. Fl. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantino

quàm de omni ejus Factione uno tempore

Statue of this Emperor at <hi>Rome</hi> with a
Croſs to it, tho' the Eccleſiaſtical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians
ſay there were many ſuch ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to him. I have ſeen of his Medals
that were ſtamp'd with it, and a very
remarkable one of his Son <hi>Conſtantius,</hi>
where he is Crown'd by a Victory on
the Reverſe with this Inſcription, <hi>In hoc
Signo Victor eris</hi> ☧. This Triumphal
Arch, and ſome other Buildings of the
ſame Age, ſhow us that Architecture
held up its Head after all the other
Arts of Deſigning were in a very weak
and languiſhing Condition, as it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
the firſt among them that revived.
If I was ſurprized not to find the Croſs in
<hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Arch, I was as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
not to ſee the Figure of the
Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on that of <hi>Titus,</hi>
where are repreſented the Golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick,
the Table of Shew-bread, and
the River <hi>Jordan.</hi> Some are of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the compoſite Pillars of this
Arch were made in Imitation of the
Pillars of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, and obſerve
that theſe are the moſt ancient of any
that are found of that Order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0168900800:301"/>
It is almoſt impoſſible for a Man to
form, in his Imagination, ſuch beautiful
and glorious Scenes as are to be met
with in ſeveral of the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches
and Chappels; for having ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Stock of ancient Marble within
the very City, and at the ſame time ſo
many different Quarries in the Bowels
of their Country, moſt of their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
are laid over with ſuch a rich Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Incruſtations, as cannot poſſibly
be found in any other Part of the World.
And notwithſtanding the incredible
Sums of Mony which have been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
laid out this way, there is ſtill the
ſame Work going forward in other
Parts of <hi>Rome,</hi> the laſt ſtill endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to out-ſhine thoſe that went before
them. Painting, Sculpture and Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture
are at preſent far from being in
a flouriſhing Condition, but 'tis thought
they may all recover themſelves under
the preſent Pontificate, if the Wars and
Confuſions of <hi>Italy</hi> will give them leave.
For as the Pope is himſelf a Maſter of
polite Learning, and a great Encourager
of Arts, ſo at <hi>Rome</hi> any of theſe Arts
immediately thrives under the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the Prince, and may be
fetched up to its Perfection in Ten or a
Dozen Years, which is the Work of an
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0168900800:302"/>
Age or Two in other Countries, where
they have not ſuch excellent Models to
form themſelves upon.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude my Obſervations on
<hi>Rome,</hi> with a Letter of King <hi>Henry</hi> the

            <p>The little Lake that gives Riſe to this
River, with its floating Iſlands, is one
of the moſt extraordinary natural Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities
about <hi>Rome.</hi> It lyes in the very
Flat of <hi>Campania,</hi> and as it is the Drain
of theſe Parts, 'tis no Wonder that it
is ſo impregnated with Sulphur. It has
at Bottom ſo thick a Sediment of it,
that upon throwing in a Stone the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
boils for a conſiderable time over the
Place which has been ſtirr'd up. At the
ſame time are ſeen little Flakes of Scurfe
riſing up, that are probably the Parts
which compoſe the Iſlands, for they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
mount of themſelves, tho' the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is not troubled.</p>
            <p>I queſtion not but this Lake was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
much larger than it is at preſent,
and that the Banks have grown over it
by degrees, in the ſame manner as the
Iſlands have been form'd on it. Nor is
it improbable but that, in Proceſs of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0168900800:306"/>
Time, the whole Surface of it may be
cruſted over, as the Iſlands enlarge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and the Banks cloſe in upon them.
All about the Lake, where the Ground
is dry, we found it to be hollow by the
Trampling of our Horſes Feet. I could
not diſcover the leaſt Traces of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byls</hi>
Temple and Grove, which ſtood on
the Borders of this Lake. <hi>Tivoli</hi> is ſeen
at a diſtance lying along the Brow of
a Hill. Its Situation has given <hi>Horace</hi>
occaſion to call it <hi>Tibur Supinum,</hi> as <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
perhaps for the ſame Reaſon entitles
it <hi>Superbum.</hi> The <hi>Villa de Medicis</hi> with
its Water-Works, the Caſcade of the
<hi>Teverone,</hi> and the Ruins of the <hi>Sibyls</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(of which <hi>Vignola</hi> has made a little
Copy at <hi>Peters de Montorio</hi>) are deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in every Itinerary. I muſt confeſs
I was moſt pleaſed with a beautiful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
that none of them have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
which lyes at about a Mile di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the Town. It opens on one
Side into the <hi>Roman Campania,</hi> where
the Eye loſes it ſelf on a ſmooth ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Plain. On the other Side is a more
broken and interrupted Scene, made up
of an infinite Variety of Inequalities and
Shadowings, that naturally ariſe from an
agreeable Mixture of Hills, Groves and
Vallies. But the moſt enlivening Part
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0168900800:307"/>
of all is the River <hi>Teverone,</hi> which you
ſee at about a Quarter of a Mile's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
throwing it ſelf down a Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice,
and falling by ſeveral Caſcades from
one Rock to another, 'till it gains the
Bottom of the Valley, where the Sight
of it would be quite loſt, did not it
ſometimes diſcover it ſelf thro' the Breaks
and Openings of the Woods that grow
about it. The <hi>Roman</hi> Painters often
work upon this Landskip, and I am apt
to believe that <hi>Horace</hi> had his Eye upon
it in thoſe Two or Three beautiful Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
which he has given us of theſe Seats.
The <hi>Teverone</hi> was formerly call'd the

one of the moſt <hi>moveable</hi> Rivers in the

ſuch a Multitude of Caſcades, and is ſo
often ſhifted out of one Channel into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
After a very turbulent and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
Courſe of ſeveral Miles among the

            <p>At <hi>Freſcati</hi> I had the Satisfaction of
ſeeing the Firſt Sketch of <hi>Verſailles</hi> in
the Walks and Water-Works. The
Proſpect from it was doubtleſs much
more delightful formerly, when the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania</hi>
was ſet thick with Towns, Villas
and Plantations. <hi>Cicero</hi>'s <hi>Tuſculum</hi> was
at a Place call'd <hi>Grotto Ferrate,</hi> about
Two Miles off this Town, tho' moſt
of the Modern Writers have fix'd it to
<hi>Freſcati. Nardini</hi> ſays, there was found
among the Ruins at <hi>Grotto Ferrate</hi> a
Piece of Sculpture which <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf
mentions in one of his familiar Epiſtles.
In going to <hi>Freſcati</hi> we had a fair View
of Mount <hi>Algido.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On our Way to <hi>Palaeſtrina</hi> we ſaw
the Lake <hi>Regillus,</hi> famous for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> who were
here ſeen to give their Horſes Drink af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Battel between the <hi>Romans</hi> and
the Son-in-Law of <hi>Tarquin.</hi> At ſome
diſtance from it we had a View of the
<hi>Lacus Gabinus,</hi> that is much larger than
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0168900800:310"/>
the former. We left the Road for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
half a Mile to ſee the Sources of
a Modern Aqueduct. It is entertaining
to obſerve how the ſeveral little Springs
and Rills, that break out of the Sides
of the Mountain, are glean'd up, and
conveyed thro' little covered Channels
into the main Hollow of the Aqueduct.
It was certainly very lucky for <hi>Rome,</hi>
ſeeing it had occaſion for ſo many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queducts,
that there chanced to be ſuch
a Range of Mountains within its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.
For by this means they could
take up their Water from what height
they pleaſed, without the Expence of
ſuch an Engine as that of <hi>Marli.</hi> Thus
the <hi>Claudian</hi> Aqueduct ran Thirty Eight
Miles, and ſunk after the Proportion
of Five Foot and a half every Mile, by
the Advantage only of a high Source
and the low Situation of <hi>Rome. Palae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrina</hi>
ſtands very high, like moſt other
Towns in <hi>Italy,</hi> for the Advantage of
the cool Breezes, for which Reaſon <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
calls it <hi>Altum,</hi> and <hi>Horace, Frigidum
Praeneſte. Statius</hi> calls it <hi>Praeneſte Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum,</hi>
becauſe of the Famous Temple
of Fortune that ſtood in it. There are
ſtill great Pillars of Granite, and other
Fragments of this ancient Temple. But
the moſt conſiderable Remnant of it is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0168900800:311"/>
a very beautiful <hi>Moſaic</hi> Pavement, the
fineſt I have ever ſeen in Marble. The
Parts are ſo well join'd together, that
the whole Piece looks like a continued
Picture. There are in it the Figures of
a Rhinoceros, of Elephants, and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Animals, with little Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skips
which look very lively and well
painted, tho' they are made out of the
natural Colours and Shadows of the
Marble. I do not remember ever to
have met with any old <hi>Roman Moſaic,</hi>
compoſed of little Pieces of Clay half
vitrify'd, and prepared at the Glaſs-Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Smalte.</hi> Theſe
are much in uſe at preſent, and may be
made of what Colour and Figure the
Work-man pleaſes, which is a Modern
Improvement of the Art, and enables
thoſe who are employ'd in it to make
much finer Pieces of <hi>Moſaic</hi> than they
did formerly.</p>
            <p>In our Excurſion to <hi>Albano</hi> we went
as far as <hi>Nemi,</hi> that takes its Name from
the <hi>Nemus Dianae.</hi> The whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
thereabouts is ſtill over-run with
Woods and Thickets. The Lake of
<hi>Nemi</hi> lyes in a very deep Bottom, ſo
ſurrounded on all Sides with Mountains
and Groves, that the Surface of it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ruffled with the leaſt Breath of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0168900800:312"/>
Wind, which perhaps, together with
the Clearneſs of its Waters, gave it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

and ſet off with many beautiful
Walks. In our Return from <hi>Jenſano</hi>
to <hi>Albano</hi> we paſſed through <hi>la Ricca,</hi> the
<hi>Aricia</hi> of the Ancients, <hi>Horace</hi>'s Firſt
Stage from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Brundiſi.</hi> There
is nothing at <hi>Albano</hi> ſo remarkable as
the Proſpect from the <hi>Capucin</hi>'s Garden,
which for the Extent and Variety of
pleaſing Incidents is, I think, the moſt
delightful one that I ever ſaw. It takes
in the whole <hi>Campania,</hi> and terminates
in a full View of the Mediterranean.
You have a Sight at the ſame time of
the <hi>Alban</hi> Lake, which lyes juſt by in
an Oval Figure of about Seven Miles
round, and, by reaſon of the continued
Circuit of high Mountains that encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
it, looks like the <hi>Area</hi> of ſome vaſt
Amphitheater. This, together with the
ſeveral green Hills and naked Rocks,
within the Neighbourhood, makes the
moſt agreeable Confuſion imaginable.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0168900800:313"/>
               <hi>Albano</hi> keeps up its Credit ſtill for Wine,
which perhaps would be as good as it
was anciently did they preſerve it to as
great an Age; but as for Olives there

            <p>We ſaw afterwards, in the Progreſs

Twenty Miles in Circuit, and is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſtock'd with Fiſh and Fowl. There
are in it a couple of Iſlands, that are
perhaps the Two floating Iſles menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by <hi>Pliny,</hi> with that improbable
Circumſtance of their appearing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
like a Circle, and ſometimes like
a Triangle, but never like a Quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.
It is eaſie enough to conceive how

as it were, in the Neighbourhood of

<hi>Montefiaſcone,</hi> the Habitation of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s
<hi>Aequi Faliſci,</hi> Aen. 7. and on the Side

            </p>
            <p>I ſaw in the Church-yard of <hi>Bolſena</hi>
an antique Funeral Monument (of that
kind which they call'd a <hi>Sarcophagus</hi>)
very entire, and what is particular, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
<hi>on all Sides</hi> with a curious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of a Bacchanal. Had the
Inhabitants obſerved a couple of lewd
Figures at one End of it, they would
not have thought it a proper Ornament
for the Place where it now ſtands. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having travell'd hence to <hi>Aquapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente,</hi>
that ſtands in a wonderful pleaſant
Situation, we came to the little Brook
which ſeparates the Pope's Dominions
from the Great Duke's. The Frontier
Caſtle of <hi>Radicofani</hi> is ſeated on the
higheſt Mountain in the Country, and
is as well fortify'd as the Situation of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0168900800:319"/>
the Place will permit. We here found
the natural Face of the Country quite
changed from what we had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
with in the Pope's Dominions.
For inſtead of the many beautiful Scenes
of green Mountains and fruitful Vallies,
that we had been preſented with for
ſome Days before, we ſaw now nothing
but a wild naked Proſpect of Rocks and
Hills, worn on all Sides with Gutters
and Channels, and not a Tree or Shrub
to be met with in a vaſt Circuit of ſeveral
Miles. This Savage Proſpect put me
in Mind of the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, that
<hi>The Pope has the Fleſh, and the Great
Duke the Bones of</hi> Italy. Among a large
Extent of theſe Barren Mountains I ſaw
but a ſingle Spot that was cultivated, on
which there ſtood a Convent.</p>

Towers of Brick, which in

ſuch of the Members as had done
any conſiderable Service to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Theſe Towers gave us a ſight of
the Town a great while before we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
it. There is nothing in this City
ſo extraordinary as the Cathedral, which
a Man may view with Pleaſure after he
has ſeen St. <hi>Peters,</hi> tho' 'tis quite of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Make, and can only be look'd
upon as one of the Maſter-pieces of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic</hi>
Architecture. When a Man ſees
the prodigious Pains and Expence, that
our Fore-Fathers have been at in theſe
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0168900800:321"/>
barbarous Buildings, one cannot but fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to himſelf what Miracles of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture
they would have left us, had
they only been inſtructed in the right
way; for when the Devotion of thoſe
Ages was much warmer than it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and the Riches of the People
much more at the Diſpoſal of the Prieſts,
there was ſo much Mony conſumed on
theſe <hi>Gothic</hi> Cathedrals, as would have
finiſh'd a greater Variety of Noble Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
than have been raiſed either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or ſince that Time.</p>
            <p>One would wonder to ſee the vaſt
Labour that has been laid out on this
ſingle Cathedral. The very Spouts are
loaden with Ornaments, the Windows
are form'd like ſo many Scenes of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective,
with a Multitude of little Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
retiring one behind another, the
great Columns are finely engraven with
Fruits and Foliage that run twiſting about
them from the very Top to the Bottom,
the whole Body of the Church is che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
with different Lays of White and
Black Marble, the Pavement curiouſly
cut out in Deſigns and Scripture-Stories,
and the Front cover'd with ſuch a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Figures, and over-run with ſo
many little Mazes and Labyrinths of
Sculpture, that nothing in the World
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0168900800:322"/>
can make a prettier Show to thoſe who
prefer falſe Beauties, and affected Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to a Noble and Majeſtick Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.
Over-againſt this Church ſtands
a large Hoſpital, erected by a Shooe-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
who has been Beatify'd, tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Sainted. There ſtands a Figure of
him ſuperſcrib'd, <hi>Sutor ultra Crepidam.</hi>
I ſhall ſpeak nothing of the Extent of
this City, the Cleanlineſs of its Streets,
nor the Beauty of its Piazza, which ſo
many Travellers have deſcribed. As this
is the laſt Republick that fell under the
Subjection of the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> ſo
is it ſtill ſuppoſed to retain many Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerings
after its ancient Liberty: For
this Reaſon, when the Keys and Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
of the Duke's Towns and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
paſs in Proceſſion before him, on
St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt's Day, I was told that
<hi>Sienna</hi> comes in the Rear of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and is puſh'd forward by thoſe
who follow, to ſhow the Reluctancy
it has to appear in ſuch a Solemnity. I
ſhall ſay nothing of the many groſs and
abſurd Traditions of St. <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi>
who is the great Saint of this Place.
I think there is as much Pleaſure in
hearing a Man tell his Dreams, as in
reading Accounts of this Nature: A
Traveller, that thinks them worth his
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0168900800:323"/>
Obſervation, may fill a Book with them
at every great Town in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Sienna</hi> we went forward to
<hi>Leghorne,</hi> where the Two Ports, the
Bagnio, and <hi>Donatelli</hi>'s Statue of the
Great Duke, amidſt the Four Slaves
chain'd to his Pedeſtal, are very noble
Sights. The Square is one of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
and will be one of the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
in <hi>Italy,</hi> when this Statue is ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in it, and a Town-houſe built at
one End of it to front the Church that
ſtands at the other. They are at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Expence to cleanſe the Ports, and
keep 'em from being choak'd up, which
they do by the help of ſeveral Engines
that are always at work, and employ
many of the Great Duke's Slaves. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
part of the Harbour they ſcoop in,
it has an Influence on all the reſt, for
the Sea immediately works the whole
Bottom to a Level. They draw a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Advantage from the Dirt that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up, as it clears the Port, and at the
ſame time dries up ſeveral Marſhes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Town, where they lay it from
time to time. One can ſcarce imagine
how great Profits the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>
receives from this ſingle Place, which
are not generally thought ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
becauſe it paſſes for a Free Port.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0168900800:324"/>
But, it is very well known how the
Great Duke, on a late occaſion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Privileges of the
Merchants, drew no ſmall Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
out of them; tho' ſtill, in reſpect of
the exorbitant Dues that are paid at
moſt other Ports, it deſervedly retains
the Name of Free. It brings into his
Dominions a great Increaſe of People
from all other Nations. They reckon in
it near Ten Thouſand <hi>Jews,</hi> many of
them very Rich, and ſo great Traffic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factors complain
they have moſt of our Country Trade
in their Hands. 'Tis true the Strangers
pay little or no Taxes directly, but out
of every thing they buy there goes a
large Gabel to the Government. The
very Ice-Merchant at <hi>Leghorne</hi> pays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a Thouſand Pound Sterling annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for his Privilege, and the Tobacco-Merchant
Ten Thouſand. The Ground
is ſold by the Great Duke at a very
high Price, and Houſes are every Day
riſing on it. All the Commodities that
go up into the Country, of which
there are great Quantities, are clogg'd
with Impoſitions as ſoon as they leave
<hi>Leghorne.</hi> All the Wines, Oils, and
Silks that come down from the fruitful
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0168900800:325"/>
Vallies of <hi>Piſa, Florence,</hi> and other Parts
of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> muſt make their Way thro'
ſeveral Duties and Taxes before they
can reach the Port. The Canal that
runs from the Sea into the <hi>Arno</hi> gives
a convenient Carriage to all Goods that
are to be ſhipp'd off, which does not
a little enrich the Owners; and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
as private Men grow wealthy,
their Legacies, Law-Suits, Daughter's the
Portions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> encreaſe, in all which the
Great Duke comes in for a conſiderable
Share. The <hi>Lucqueſe,</hi> who Traffick at this
Port, are ſaid to bring in a great deal into
the Duke's Coffers. Another Advantage,
which may be of great uſe to him, is,
that at Five or Six Days warning he
might find Credit in this Town for
very large ſumms of Money, which no
other Prince in <hi>Italy</hi> can pretend to. I
need not take notice of the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that this Port gives him among Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes, but there is one Benefit
ariſing from it, which, tho' never thrown
into the Account, is doubtleſs very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.
It is well known how the
<hi>Piſans</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> long regretted the
Loſs of their ancient Liberty, and their
Subjection to a Family that ſome of
them thought themſelves equal to, in
the flouriſhing Times of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0168900800:326"/>
The Town of <hi>Leghorne</hi>
has accidentally done what the greateſt
Fetch of Politicks would have found
difficult to have brought about, for it
has almoſt unpeopled <hi>Piſa,</hi> if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it with what it was formerly, and
every Day leſſens the Number of the
Inhabitants of <hi>Florence.</hi> This does not
only weaken thoſe Places, but at the
ſame time turns many of the buſieſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
from their old Notions of Honour
and Liberty, to the Thoughts of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
and Merchandiſe: And as Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in a Road of Thriving are no
Friends to Changes and Revolutions,
they are at preſent worn into a Habit of
Subjection, and puſh all their Purſuits
another way. It is no Wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the Great Duke has ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of the Pope's making <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
Vecchia</hi> a Free Port, which may in
time prove ſo very prejudicial to <hi>Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne.</hi>
It would be thought an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Story, ſhould I ſet down the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Methods that are commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to have been made uſe of, during
the laſt Pontificate, to put a ſtop to this
Deſign. The Great Duke's Mony was
ſo well beſtow'd in the Conclave, that
ſeveral of the Cardinals diſſuaded the
Pope from the Undertaking, and at laſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0168900800:327"/>
turn'd all his Thoughts upon the little
Port which he made at <hi>Antium,</hi> near
<hi>Nettuno.</hi> The chief Work-men that were
to have convey'd the Water to <hi>Civita
Vecchia</hi> were bought off, and when a
poor <hi>Capucin,</hi> that was thought Proof
againſt all Bribes, had undertaken to
carry on the Work, he dy'd a little
after he had enter'd upon it. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Pope however, who is very well
acquainted with the Secret Hiſtory, and
the Weakneſs of his Predeceſſor, ſeems
reſolved to bring the Project to its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
He has already been at vaſt
Charges in finiſhing the Aqueduct, and
had ſome Hopes that, if the War ſhould
drive our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants from <hi>Sicily</hi>
and <hi>Naples,</hi> they would ſettle here. His
Holineſs has told ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that thoſe of our Nation ſhould
have the greateſt Privileges of any but
the Subjects of the Church. One of
our Countreymen, who makes a good
Figure at <hi>Rome,</hi> told me the Pope has
this Deſign extremely at his Heart, but
that he fears the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like a Reſident or Conſul in his
Dominions, tho' at the ſame time he
hoped the Buſineſs might as well be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by one that had no publick Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
This Gentleman has ſo buſied
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0168900800:328"/>
himſelf in the Affair, that he has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cardinals,
inſomuch that Cardinal <hi>Janſon</hi> refuſed
to ſee him when he would have made
his Apology for what he had ſaid to the
Pope on this Subject. There is one
great Objection to <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> that
the Air of the Place is not wholſome;
but this they ſay proceeds from want of
Inhabitants, the Air of <hi>Leghorne</hi> having
been worſe than this before the Town
was well peopled.</p>
            <p>The great Profits which have accrued
to the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> from his Free
Port have ſet ſeveral of the States of <hi>Italy</hi>
on the ſame Project. The moſt likely
to ſucceed in it would be the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi>
who lye more convenient than the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi>
and have a more inviting Form
of Government than that of the Church,
or that of <hi>Florence.</hi> But as the Port of

            <head>THE
REPUBLICK
OF
LVCCA.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is very pleaſant to ſee how
the ſmall Territories of this
little Republick are cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the beſt Advantage,
ſo that one cannot find the
leaſt Spot of Ground, that is not made
to contribute its utmoſt to the Owner.
In all the Inhabitants there appears an
Air of Chearfulneſs and Plenty, not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to be met with in thoſe of the
Countries which lye about 'em. There
is but one Gate for Strangers to enter
at, that it may be known what Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of them are in the Town. Over
it is written in Letters of Gold, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Republick is ſhut up in the
Great Duke's Dominions, who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0168900800:331"/>
is very much incenſed againſt it, and
ſeems to threaten it with the Fate of
<hi>Florence, Piſa,</hi> and <hi>Sienna.</hi> The Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
as follows.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lucqueſe</hi> plead Preſcription for
Hunting in one of the Duke's Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
that lyes upon their Frontiers,
which about Two Years ſince was
ſtrictly forbidden them, the Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to preſerve the Game for his
own Pleaſure. Two or Three Sportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Republick, who had the
Hardineſs to offend againſt the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
were ſeized, and kept in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Priſon. Their Country-men,
to the number of Threeſcore, attack'd
the Place where they were kept in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody,
and reſcued them. The Great
Duke redemands his Priſoners, and, as
a further Satisfaction, would have the
Governor of the Town, where the
Threeſcore Aſſailants had combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
deliver'd into his Hands; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
only Excuſes, he reſolved to do
himſelf Juſtice. Accordingly he order'd
all the <hi>Lucqueſe</hi> to be ſeiz'd that were
found on a Market-Day, in one of his
Frontier Towns. Theſe amounted to
Fourſcore, among whom were Perſons
of ſome Conſequence in the Republick.
They are now in Priſon at <hi>Florence,</hi> and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0168900800:332"/>
as it is ſaid, treated hardly enough, for
there are Fifteen of the Number dead
within leſs than Two Years. The King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> who is Protector of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
received Information from
the Great Duke of what had paſs'd, who
approved of his Proceedings, and order'd
the <hi>Lucqueſe,</hi> by his Governour or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
to give a proper Satisfaction. The
Republick, thinking themſelves ill uſed
by their Protector, as they ſay at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
have ſent to Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the Emperor's Protection, with an
offer of Winter-Quarters, as it is ſaid,
for Four Thouſand <hi>Germans.</hi> The Great
Duke riſes on them in his Demands,
and will not be ſatisfy'd with leſs than
a Hundred Thouſand Crowns, and a
Solemn Ambaſſy to beg Pardon for the
paſt, and promiſe Amendment for the
future. Thus ſtands the Affair at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that may end in the Ruin of the
Common-wealth, if the <hi>French</hi> ſucceed
in <hi>Italy.</hi> It is pleaſant however to hear
the Diſcourſe of the Common People of
<hi>Lucca,</hi> who are firmly perſuaded that
One <hi>Lucqueſe</hi> can beat Five <hi>Florentines,</hi>
who are grown low ſpirited, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
by the Great Duke's Oppreſſions,
and have nothing worth fighting for.
They ſay they can bring into the Field
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0168900800:333"/>
Twenty or Thirty Thouſand fighting
Men, all ready to Sacrifice their Lives for
their Liberty. They have Quantity of
Arms and Ammunition, but few Horſe.
It muſt be own'd theſe People are more
happy, at leaſt in Imagination, than the
reſt of their Neighbours, becauſe they
think themſelves ſo; tho' ſuch a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
Happineſs is not peculiar to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans,
for we find the Subjects of
the moſt abſolute Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> are
as proud of their Monarch as the <hi>Luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſe</hi>
of being ſubject to none. Should
the <hi>French</hi> Affairs proſper in <hi>Italy,</hi> it is
poſſible the Great Duke may bargain for
the Republick of <hi>Lucca,</hi> by the help of
his great Treaſures, as his Predeceſſors
did formerly with the Emperor for that
of <hi>Sienna.</hi> The Great Dukes have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet attempted any thing on <hi>Lucca,</hi>
as not only fearing the Arms of their
Protector, but becauſe they are well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
that ſhould the <hi>Lucqueſe</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the laſt Extremities, they would
rather throw themſelves under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the <hi>Geneoſe,</hi> or ſome ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Neighbour, than ſubmit to a State
for which they have ſo great an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
And the <hi>Florentines</hi> are very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that it is much better having a
weak State within their Dominions,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0168900800:334"/>
than the Branch of one as ſtrong as
themſelves. But ſhould ſo formidable a
Power, as that of the <hi>French</hi> King, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them in their Attempts, there is
no Government in <hi>Italy</hi> that would
dare to interpoſe. This Republick, for
the Extent of its Dominions, is eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the richeſt and beſt peopled State
of <hi>Italy.</hi> The whole Adminiſtration of
the Government paſſes into different
Hands at the End of every Two Months,
which is the greateſt Security imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their Liberty, and wonderfully
contributes to the quick Diſpatch of all
publick Affairs: But in any Exigence
of State, like that they are now preſſed
with, it certainly asks a much longer
time to conduct any Deſign, for the
Good of the Common-wealth, to its
Maturity and Perfection.</p>

            <p>There are ſome beautiful Palaces it
<hi>Florence</hi>; and as <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Pillars and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0168900800:336"/>
Work owe their Original to this
Country, the Architects always take care
to give them a Place in the great Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that are raiſed in <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> The
Duke's new Palace is a very noble Pile,
built after this manner, which makes
it look extremely Solid and Majeſtick.
It is not unlike that of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> at
<hi>Paris,</hi> which was built by <hi>Mary</hi> of
<hi>Medicis,</hi> and for that Reaſon perhaps
the Workmen fell into the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
I found in the Court of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
what I could not meet with any
where in <hi>Rome.</hi> I mean an Antique Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>Hercules</hi> lifting up <hi>Antaeus</hi> from
the Earth, which I have already had
occaſion to ſpeak of. It was found in
<hi>Rome,</hi> and brought hither under the
Reign of <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth. There are
abundance of Pictures in the ſeveral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments,
by the Hands of the greateſt
Maſters.</p>
            <p>But 'tis the Famous Gallery of the
Old Palace, where are perhaps the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
Collections of Curioſities to be
met with in any Part of the whole World.
The Gallery it ſelf is made in the Shape
of an L, according to Mr. <hi>Laſſel,</hi> but,
if it muſt needs be like a Letter, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
the <hi>Greek</hi> Π moſt. It is adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with admirable Pieces of Sculpture,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0168900800:337"/>
as well Modern as Ancient. Of the laſt
Sort I ſhall mention thoſe that are rareſt,
either for the Perſon they repreſent, or
the Beauty of the Sculpture. Among
the Buſts of the Emperors and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes
there are theſe that follow, which
are all very ſcarce, and ſome of them
almoſt ſingular in their kind. <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
               <hi>Caligula, Otho, Nerva, Aelius Verus,</hi>
               <hi>Pertinax, Geta, Didius, Julianus, Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
extremely well wrought, and what
is ſeldom ſeen in Alabaſter, <hi>Gordianus
Africanus</hi> the elder, <hi>Eliogabalus, Galien</hi>
the elder, and the younger <hi>Pupienus.</hi> I
have put <hi>Agrippa</hi> among the Emperors,
becauſe he is generally ranged ſo in Sets
of Medals, as ſome that follow among
the Empereſſes have no other Right to
the Company they are joined with. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitia,</hi>
               <hi>Agrippina</hi> Wife of <hi>Germanicus,</hi>
               <hi>Antonia, Matidia, Plotina, Mallia Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilla,</hi>
falſely inſcribed under her Buſt
<hi>Julia Severi, Aquilia Severa, Julia Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.</hi>
I have generally obſerved at <hi>Rome,</hi>
which is the great Magazine of theſe
Antiquities, that the ſame Heads which
are rare in Medals are alſo rare in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and indeed one may commonly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
the ſame Reaſon for both, which
was the Shortneſs of the Emperor
Reigns, that did not give the Work
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0168900800:338"/>
men time to make many of their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures;
and as the Shortneſs of their
Reigns was generally occaſioned by the
Advancement of a Rival, it is no Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that no Body worked on the Figure
of a Deceaſed Emperor, when his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was in the Throne. This Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
however does not always hold. An
<hi>Agrippa</hi> or <hi>Caligula,</hi> for Example, is a
common Coin, but a very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Buſt; and a <hi>Tiberius</hi> a rare Coin, but
a common Buſt, which one would the
more wonder at, if we conſider the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities
that were offered to this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
Statues after his Death. The
<hi>Tiberius in Tiberim</hi> is a known Inſtance.</p>
            <p>Among the Buſts of ſuch Emperors
as are common enough, there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
in the Gallery that deſerve to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of for the Excellence of the
Sculpture, as thoſe of <hi>Auguſtus, Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi>
               <hi>Adrian, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius
Verus, Septimius Severus, Caracalla, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi>
There is in the ſame Gallery a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Buſt of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Face to Heaven, with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Air of Grief or Diſcontentedneſs in
his Looks. I have ſeen Two or Three
antique Buſts of <hi>Alexander</hi> in the ſame
Air and Poſture, and am apt to think
the Sculptor had in his Thoughts the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0168900800:339"/>
Conqueror's weeping for new Worlds,
or ſome other the like Circumſtance of
his Hiſtory. There is alſo in <hi>Porphyry</hi>
the Head of a Faun, and of the God
<hi>Pan.</hi> Among the entire Figures I took
particular notice of a Veſtal Virgin,
with the Holy Fire burning before her.
This Statue, I think, may decide that
notable Controverſie among the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries,
whether the Veſtals, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
received the Tonſure, ever ſuffered
their Hair to come again, for it is here
full grown, and gathered under the Veil.
The Brazen Figure of the Conſul, with
the Ring on his Finger, reminded me
of <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s <hi>majoris pondera Gemmae.</hi>
There is another Statue in Braſs, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be of <hi>Apollo,</hi> with this Modern
Inſcription on the Pedeſtal, which I
muſt confeſs I do not know what to
make of. <hi>Ut potui huc veni muſis et fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
relicto.</hi> I ſaw in the ſame Gallery
the Famous Figure of the Wild Boar,
the Gladiator, the <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> the <hi>Cupid</hi>
and <hi>Pſyche,</hi> the <hi>Flora,</hi> with ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Statues that ſeveral others have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.
Among the Antique Figures
there is a fine one of <hi>Morpheus</hi> in Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.
I have always obſerved, that this
God is repreſented by the ancient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries
under the Figure of a Boy aſleep,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0168900800:340"/>
with a Bundle of Poppy in his Hand.
I at firſt took it for a <hi>Cupid,</hi> 'till I had
taken notice that it had neither Bow nor
Quiver. I ſuppoſe Doctor <hi>Liſter</hi> has
been guilty of the ſame Miſtake in the
Reflections he makes on what he calls,
the ſleeping <hi>Cupid</hi> with Poppy in his
Hands.<q>

            <p>I never ſaw any Figure of Sleep that
was not of Black Marble, which has
probably ſome Relation to the Night,
that is the proper Seaſon for Reſt. I
ſhould not have made this Remark, but
that I remember to have read in one of
the ancient Authors, that the <hi>Nile</hi> is
generally repreſented in Stone of this
Colour, becauſe it flows from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi>; which ſhows us
that the Statuaries had ſometimes an Eye
to the Perſon they were to repreſent,
in the Choice they made of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
There are ſtill at <hi>Rome</hi> ſome of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0168900800:342"/>
theſe Black Statues of the <hi>Nile</hi> which
are cut in a kind of Touchſtone.<q>

            <p>At one End of the Gallery ſtand Two
antique Marble Pillars, curiouſly wrought
with the Figures of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Arms
and Inſtruments of War. After a full
Survey of the Gallery, we were led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Four or Five Chambers of Curioſities
that ſtand on the Side of it. The Firſt
was a Cabinet of Antiquities, made up
chiefly of Idols, Taliſmans, Lamps and
Hieroglyphics. I ſaw nothing in it that
I was not before acquainted with, except
the Four following Figures in Braſs.</p>
            <p n="1">I. A little Image of <hi>Juno Siſpita,</hi> or
<hi>Soſpita,</hi> which perhaps is not to be met
with any where elſe but on Medals. She
is cloathed in a Goats-skin, the Horns
ſticking out above her Head. The Right
Arm is broken that probably ſupported
a Shield, and the Left a little defac'd,
tho' one may ſee it held ſomething in its
Graſp formerly. The Feet are bare. I
remember <hi>Tully</hi>'s Deſcription of this
Goddeſs in the following Words.

            <p n="2">II. An antique Model of the Famous
<hi>Laocöon</hi> and his Two Sons, that ſtands
in the <hi>Belvidera</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> This is the
more remarkable, as it is entire in thoſe
Parts where the Statue is maim'd. It was

            <p>The two next Chambers are made up
of ſeveral Artificial Curioſities in Ivory,
Amber, Cryſtal, Marble, and precious
Stones, which all Voyage-Writers are
full of. In the Chamber that is ſhown
laſt ſtands the celebrated <hi>Venus</hi> of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi>
The Statue ſeems much leſs than
the Life, as being perfectly naked, and
in Company with others of a larger
Make: It is notwithſtanding as big as
the ordinary ſize of a Woman, as I
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0168900800:345"/>
concluded from the Meaſure of her
Wriſt; for from the Bigneſs of any one
Part it is eaſie to gueſs at all the reſt,
in a Figure of ſuch nice Proportions.
The Softneſs of the Fleſh, the Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Shape, Air and Poſture, and
the Correctneſs of Deſign in this Statue
are inexpreſſible. I have ſeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to believe that the Name of the
Sculptor on the Pedeſtal is not ſo old
as the Statue. This Figure of <hi>Venus</hi>
put me in Mind of a Speech ſhe makes
in one of the <hi>Greek</hi> Epigrams.<q>

            <p>There is another <hi>Venus</hi> in the ſame
Circle, that would make a good Figure
any where elſe. There are among the old
<hi>Roman</hi> Statues ſeveral of <hi>Venus</hi> in different
Poſtures and Habits, as there are many
particular Figures of her made after the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0168900800:346"/>
ſame Deſign. I fancy it is not hard to
find among them ſome that were made
after the Three Statues of this Goddeſs,
which <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions. In the ſame
Chamber is the <hi>Roman</hi> Slave whetting
his Knife and liſtning, which from the
Shoulders upward is incomparable. The
Two Wreſtlers are in the ſame Room.
I obſerved here likewiſe a very curious
Buſt of <hi>Annius Verus,</hi> the young Son
of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> who dy'd at Nine
Years of Age. I have ſeen ſeveral other
Buſts of him at <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' his Medals
are exceeding rare.</p>
            <p>The Great Duke has ordered a large
Chamber to be fitted up for old Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Urns, Monuments, and the like
Sets of Antiquities. I was ſhown ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of them which are not yet put up.
There are the Two Famous Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that give ſo great a light to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
of <hi>Appius,</hi> who made the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and of <hi>Fabius</hi> the Dictator; they
contain a ſhort Account of the Honours
they paſs'd through, and the Actions
they performed. I ſaw too the Buſts of
<hi>Tranquillina,</hi> Mother to <hi>Gordianus Pius,</hi>
and of <hi>Quintus Herennius,</hi> Son to <hi>Trajan
Decius,</hi> which are extremely valuable
for their Rarity, and a beautiful old Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0168900800:347"/>
made after the celebrated Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodite
in the <hi>Villa Borgheſe.</hi> I ſaw
nothing that has not been obſerved by
ſeveral others in the <hi>Argenteria,</hi> the
Tabernacle of St. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s Chapel,
and the Chamber of Painters. The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> will be perhaps the
moſt coſtly Piece of Work on the Face
of the Earth when compleated, but it
advances ſo very ſlowly, that 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
but the Family of <hi>Medicis</hi> may be
Extinct before their Burial Place is
finiſh'd.</p>
            <p>The Great Duke has lived many Years
ſeparate from the Dutcheſs, who is at
preſent in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
there to end her Days. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
his Brother is old and infirm, and
could never be induced to reſign his
Purple for the uncertain Proſpect of
giving an Heir to the Dukedom of <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany.</hi>
The Great Prince has been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
ſeveral Years without any Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and notwithſtanding all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions
in the World were taken for
the Marriage of the Prince his younger
Brother (as the finding out a Lady for
him who was in the Vigour and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of her Age, and had given Marks of
her Fruitfulneſs by a former Husband)
they have all hitherto proved unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0168900800:348"/>
There is a Branch of the Family of
<hi>Medicis</hi> in <hi>Naples</hi>: The Head of it has been
own'd as a Kinſman by the Grand Duke,
and 'tis thought will ſucceed to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
in caſe the Princes his Sons
die Childleſs; though 'tis not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but in ſuch a Conjuncture, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
that are thrown under
the Great Dutchy, may make ſome
Efforts towards the Recovery of their
ancient Liberty.</p>
            <p>I was in the Library of Manuſcripts
belonging to St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> of which there
is a Printed Catalogue. I look'd into
the <hi>Virgil</hi> which diſputes its Antiquity
with that of the <hi>Vatican.</hi> It wants the
<hi>Ille ego qui quondam,</hi> &amp;c. and the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Two Lines in the Second <hi>Aeneid,</hi>
beginning at <hi>Jamque adeo ſuper unus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>—I
muſt confeſs I always thought
this Paſſage left out with a great deal of
Judgment by <hi>Tucca</hi> and <hi>Varius,</hi> as it
ſeems to contradict a Part in the Sixth
<hi>Aeneid,</hi> and repreſents the Heroe in a
Paſſion, that is, at leaſt, not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Greatneſs of his Character.
Beſides, I think the Apparition of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
comes in very properly to draw him
away from the Sight of <hi>Priam</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
for without ſuch a Machine to take
him off, I can't ſee how the Heroe could,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0168900800:349"/>
with Honour, leave <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
and <hi>Priam</hi> unrevenged. But
ſince <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Friends thought fit to let
drop this Incident of <hi>Helen,</hi> I wonder
they would not blot out, or alter a
Line in <hi>Venus</hi>'s Speech, that has a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Rencounter, and comes in
improperly without it.<q>

            <p>We here quickly felt the Difference
of the Northern from the Southern
Side of the Mountains, as well in the
Coldneſs of the Air, as in the Badneſs
of the Wine. This Town is Famous
for the Richneſs of the Soil that lyes
about it, and the Magnificence of its
Convents. It is likewiſe eſteemed the
Third in <hi>Italy</hi> for Pictures, as having
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0168900800:354"/>
been the School of the <hi>Lombard</hi> Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
I ſaw in it Three Rarities of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
kinds, which pleaſed me more
than any other Shows of the Place. The
firſt was an Authentick Silver Medal of
the younger <hi>Brutus,</hi> in the Hands of an
Eminent Antiquary. One may ſee the
Character of the Perſon in the Features
of the Face, which is exquiſitely well
cut. On the Reverſe is the Cap of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
with a Dagger on each ſide of it,
ſubſcribed <hi>Id. Mar.</hi> for the Ides of <hi>March,</hi>
the famous Date of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Murder.
The Second was a Picture of <hi>Raphel</hi>'s
in St. <hi>Giouanni</hi> in <hi>Monte.</hi> It is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
well preſerved, and repreſents St. <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia</hi>
with an Inſtrument of Muſick in
her Hands. On one ſide of her are the
Figures of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi>; and
on the other, of <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> and
St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> There is ſomething won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
Divine in the Airs of this Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
I cannot forbear mentioning, for
my Third Curioſity, a new Stair-Caſe
that Strangers are generally carryed to ſee,
where the Eaſineſs of the Aſcent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſo ſmall a Compaſs, the Diſpoſition
of the Lights, and the convenient Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are admirably well contrived. The
Wars of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Seaſon of the
Year, made me paſs thro' the Dutchies
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0168900800:355"/>
of <hi>Modena, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> with
more haſte than I would have done at
another time. The Soil of <hi>Modena</hi> and
<hi>Parma</hi> is very rich and well cultivated.
The Palaces of the Princes are magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent,
but neither of them is yet fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
We procured a Licence of the
Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to enter the Theater
and Gallery, which deſerve to be ſeen
as well as any thing of that Nature in
<hi>Italy.</hi> The Theater is, I think, the
moſt ſpacious of any I ever ſaw, and at
the ſame time ſo admirably well contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that from the very depth of the
Stage the loweſt Sound may be heard
diſtinctly to the fartheſt part of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
as in a Whiſpering Place; and
yet if you raiſe your Voice as high as
you pleaſe, there is nothing like an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
to cauſe in it the leaſt Confuſion.
The Gallery is hung with a numerous
Collection of Pictures, all done by ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
Hands. On one Side of the
Gallery is a large Room adorned with
Inlaid Tables, Cabinets, Works in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and other Pieces of great Art and
Value. Out of this we were led into
another great Room, furniſhed with
old Inſcriptions, Idols, Buſts, Medals,
and the like Antiquities. I could have
ſpent a Day with great Satisfaction in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0168900800:356"/>
this Apartment, but had only time to
paſs my Eye over the Medals, which
are in great Number, and many of them
very rare. The ſcarceſt of all is a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcennius
Niger</hi> on a Medalion well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.
It was coined at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where
this Emperor trifled away his Time 'till
he loſt his Life and Empire. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
is a <hi>Dea Salus.</hi> There are Two
of <hi>Otho,</hi> the Reverſe a <hi>Serapis</hi>; and
Two of <hi>Meſſalina</hi> and <hi>Poppaea</hi> in mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Braſs, the Reverſes of the Emperor
<hi>Claudius.</hi> I ſaw Two Medalions of <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi>
and <hi>Matidia,</hi> the Reverſe to each
a <hi>Pietas</hi>; with Two Medals of <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax,</hi>
the Reverſe of one <hi>Vota Decenna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
and of the other <hi>Diis Cuſtodibus</hi>;
and another of <hi>Gordianus Africanus,</hi> the
Reverſe I have forgot.</p>
            <p>The Principalities of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
are much about the ſame Extent,
and have each of them Two large
Towns, beſides a great Number of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Villages. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is much richer than the Duke of
<hi>Modena.</hi> Their Subjects would live in
great Plenty amidſt ſo rich and well cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
a Soil, were not the Taxes and
Impoſitions ſo very Exorbitant; for the
Courts are much too ſplendid and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
for the Territories that lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0168900800:357"/>
them, and one cannot but be ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to ſee ſuch a Profuſion of Wealth
laid out in Coaches, Trappings, Tables,
Cabinets, and the like precious Toys,
in which there are few Princes of <hi>Europe</hi>
who equal them, when at the ſame time
they have not had the Generoſity to
make Bridges over the Rivers of their
Countries for the Convenience of their
Subjects, as well as Strangers, who are
forced to pay an unreaſonable Exaction
at every Ferry upon the leaſt Riſing of
the Waters. A Man might well expect
in theſe ſmall Governments a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Regulation of Affairs, for the Eaſe
and Benefit of the People, than in large
over-grown States, where the Rules of
Juſtice, Beneficence, and Mercy may be
eaſily put out of their Courſe, in paſſing
thro' the Hands of Deputies, and a long
Subordination of Officers. And it would
certainly be for the Good of Mankind
to have all the mighty Empires and
Monarchies of the World cantoned out
into petty States and Principalities, that,
like ſo many large Families, might lye
under the Eye and Obſervation of their
proper Governors; ſo that the Care of
the Prince might extend it ſelf to every

But ſince ſuch a general Scheme can

ill at preſent to be born under one of
theſe petty Soveraigns, that will be ſtill
endeavouring, at his Subjects Coſt, to

of his own Rank.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon there are no People

there are none who ſuffer more under
the Grievances of a hard Government,
than the Subjects of little Principalities.
I left the Road of <hi>Milan</hi> on my Right
Hand, having before ſeen that City, and
after having paſſed through <hi>Aſti,</hi> the
Frontier Town of <hi>Savoy,</hi> I at laſt came
within Sight of the <hi>Po,</hi> which is a fine
River even at <hi>Turin,</hi> though within Six
Miles of its Source. This River has
been made the Scene of Two or Three
Poetical Stories. <hi>Ovid</hi> has choſen it
out to throw his <hi>Phaeton</hi> into it, after
all the ſmaller Rivers had been dryed up
in the Conflagration.</p>
            <p>I have read ſome Botanical Criticks,
who tell us the Poets have not rightly
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0168900800:359"/>
followed the Traditions of Antiquity
in Metamorphoſing the Siſters of <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
into Poplars, who ought to have
been turned into Larch-trees; for that
it is this kind of Tree which ſheds a
Gum, and is commonly found on the
Banks of the <hi>Po.</hi> The Change of <hi>Cyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
into a Swan, which cloſes up the
Diſaſters of <hi>Phaeton</hi>'s Family, was
wrought on the ſame Place where the
Siſters were turned into Trees. The

            <p>The River <hi>Po</hi> gives a Name to the
chief Street of <hi>Turin,</hi> which fronts the
Duke's Palace, and, when finiſh'd, will
be one of the nobleſt in <hi>Italy</hi> for its
Length. There is one Convenience in
this City that I never obſerved in any
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0168900800:362"/>
other, and which makes ſome amends
for the Badneſs of the Pavement. By
the help of a River, that runs on the
upper Side of the Town, they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
a little Stream of Water through
all the moſt conſiderable Streets, which
ſerves to cleanſe the Gutters, and carries
away all the Filth that is ſwept into it.
The Manager opens his Sluce every
Night, and diſtributes the Water into
what Quarters of the Town he pleaſes.
Beſides the ordinary Convenience that
ariſes from it, it is of great uſe when a
Fire chances to break out, for at a few
Minutes warning they have a little Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
running by the very Walls of the
Houſe that is Burning. The Court of
<hi>Turin</hi> is reckoned the moſt ſplendid and
Polite of any in <hi>Italy</hi>; but by reaſon
of its being in Mourning, I could not
ſee it in its Magnificence. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People of this State are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated
againſt the <hi>French</hi> than even
the reſt of the <hi>Italians.</hi> For the great
Miſchiefs they have ſuffered from them
are ſtill freſh upon their Memories, and
notwithſtanding this Interval of Peace,
one may eaſily trace out the ſeveral Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
which the <hi>French</hi> Armies have made
through their Country, by the Ruin
and Deſolation they have left behind
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0168900800:363"/>
them. I paſſed through <hi>Piemont</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi>
at a time when the Duke was forced,
by the Neceſſity of his Affairs, to be in
Alliance with the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I came directly from <hi>Turin</hi> to <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
and had a very eaſie Journey over
Mount <hi>Cennis,</hi> though about the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>December,</hi> the Snows having not
yet fallen. On the Top of this high
Mountain is a large Plain, and in the
midſt of the Plain a beautiful Lake, which
would be very extraordinary were there
not ſeveral Mountains in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
riſing over it. The Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
pretend that it is unfathomable,
and I queſtion not but the Waters of it
fill up a deep Valley, before they come
to a Level with the Surface of the Plain.
It is well ſtocked with Trouts, though
they ſay it is covered with Ice Three
Quarters of the Year.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in the natural Face
of <hi>Italy</hi> that is more delightful to a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
than the ſeveral Lakes which are
diſperſed up and down among the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Breaks and Hollows of the <hi>Alps</hi> and
<hi>Appennines.</hi> For as theſe vaſt Heaps of
Mountains are thrown together with ſo
much Irregularity and Confuſion, they
form a great Variety of hollow Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
that often lye in the Figure of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0168900800:364"/>
ſo many artificial Baſins; where, if any
Fountains chance to riſe, they naturally
ſpread themſelves into Lakes before they
can find any Iſſue for their Waters.
The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> took a great deal
of Pains to hew out a Paſſage for theſe
Lakes to diſcharge themſelves into ſome
neighbouring River, for the bettering
of the Air, or the recovering of the
Soil that lay underneath them. The
Draining of the <hi>Fucinus</hi> by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<hi>Claudius,</hi> with the prodigious Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Spectators who attended it,
and the Famous <hi>Naumachia</hi> and ſplendid
Entertainment which were made upon
it before the Sluces were opened, is a
known Piece of Hiſtory. In all our
Journey through the <hi>Alps,</hi> as well when
we climbed as when we deſcended them,
we had ſtill a River running along with
the Road, that probably at firſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
the Diſcovery of this Paſſage. I
ſhall end this Chapter with a Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Alps,</hi> as I did the laſt with
thoſe of the <hi>Appennines.</hi> The Poet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
would not have taken notice, that
there is no Spring nor Summer on theſe
Mountains, but becauſe in this Reſpect
the <hi>Alps</hi> are quite different from the
<hi>Appennines,</hi> which have as delightful
Green Spots among them as any in <hi>Italy.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>EAR St. <hi>Julian</hi> in <hi>Savoy</hi> the
<hi>Alps</hi> begin to enlarge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on all ſides, and open
into a vaſt Circuit of Ground,
which in Reſpect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Parts of the <hi>Alps</hi> may paſs for a plain
Champian Country. This Extent of
Lands, with the <hi>Leman</hi> Lake, would make
one of the prettieſt and moſt defenſible
Dominions in <hi>Europe</hi> was it all thrown
into a ſingle State, and had <hi>Geneva</hi> for
its Metropolis. But there are Three
powerful Neighbours who divide among
them the greateſt part of this fruitful
Country. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> has the
<hi>Chablais,</hi> and all the Fields that lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the <hi>Arve,</hi> as far as to the <hi>Ecluſe.</hi>
The King of <hi>France</hi> is Maſter of the
whole Country of <hi>Gex</hi>; and the Canton of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0168900800:368"/>
               <hi>Bern</hi> comes in for that of <hi>Vaud. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>
and its little Territories lye in the
Heart of theſe Three States. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of the Town ſtands upon a Hill,
and has its Views bounded on all Sides by
ſeveral Ranges of Mountains, which are
however at ſo great a Diſtance, that
they leave open a wonderful Variety of
beautiful Proſpects. The Situation of
theſe Mountains has ſome particular Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
on the Country, which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe.
As firſt, they cover it from all
Winds, except the South and North.
'Tis to the laſt of theſe Winds that the
Inhabitants of <hi>Geneva</hi> aſcribe the Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of their Air; for as the <hi>Alps</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
them on all ſides, they form a vaſt
kind of Baſon, where there would be a
conſtant Stagnation of Vapours, the
Country being ſo well water'd, did not
the North Wind put them in Motion,
and ſcatter them from time to time.
Another Effect the <hi>Alps</hi> have on <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>
is, that the Sun here riſes later,
and ſets ſooner than it does to other
Places of the ſame Latitude. I have
often obſerved that the Tops of the
neighbouring Mountains have been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Light above half an Hour
after the Sun is down, in reſpect of
thoſe who live at <hi>Geneva.</hi> Theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0168900800:369"/>
likewiſe very much increaſe their
Summer Heats, and make up a Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
that has ſomething in it very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and agreeable. On one Side you
have the long Tract of Hills, that goes
under the Name of Mount <hi>Jura,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Vineyards and Paſturage, and
on the other huge Precipices of naked
Rocks riſing up in a Thouſand odd Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
and cleft in ſome Places, ſo as to
diſcover high Mountains of Snow that
lye ſeveral Leagues behind them. Towards
the South the Hills riſe more inſenſibly,
and leave the Eye a vaſt uninterrupted
Proſpect for many Miles. But the moſt
beautiful View of all is the Lake, and
the Borders of it that lye North of the
Town.</p>
            <p>This Lake reſembles a Sea in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of its Waters, the Storms that are
raiſed on it, and the Ravage it makes on
its Banks. It receives too a different
Name from the Coaſts it waſhes, and in
Summer has ſomething like an Ebb and
Flow, which ariſes from the melting of
the Snows that fall into it more copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at Noon, than at other times of the
Day. It has Five different States bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
on it, the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi>
the Dutchy of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Canton of
<hi>Bern,</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0168900800:370"/>
Republick of <hi>Geneva.</hi> I have ſeen Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
fix'd up in the Canton of <hi>Bern,</hi> with
this magnificent Preface; <hi>Whereas we
have been informed of ſeveral Abuſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in our Ports and Harbours on the
Lake,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I made a little Voyage round the Lake,
and touch'd on the ſeveral Towns that
lye on its Coaſts, which took up near
Five Days, tho' the Wind was pretty
fair for us all the while.</p>
            <p>The Right Side of the Lake from
<hi>Geneva</hi> belongs to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
is extreamly well cultivated. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Entertainment we found in coaſting
it were the ſeveral Proſpects of Woods,
Vineyards, Meadows, and Corn-Fields
which lye on the Borders of it, and run
up all the Sides of the <hi>Alps,</hi> where the
Barrenneſs of the Rocks, or the Steep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Aſcent will ſuffer them.
The Wine however on this ſide of the
Lake is by no means ſo good as that
on the other, as it has not ſo open a Soil,
and is leſs expos'd to the Sun. We here
paſs'd by <hi>Yvoire,</hi> where the Duke keeps his
Gallies, and lodg'd at <hi>Tonon,</hi> which is the
greateſt Town on the Lake belonging to
the <hi>Savoyard.</hi> It has Four Convents,
and they ſay about ſix or ſeven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Inhabitants. The Lake is here about
Twelve Miles in Breadth. At a little
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0168900800:371"/>
Diſtance from <hi>Tonon</hi> ſtands <hi>Ripaille,</hi> where
is a Convent of <hi>Carthuſians.</hi> They have
a large Foreſt cut out into Walks, that are
extremely thick and gloomy, and very
ſuitable to the Genius of the Inhabitants.
There are <hi>Viſta</hi>'s in it of a great Length,
that terminate upon the Lake. At one
Side of the Walks you have a near Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the <hi>Alps,</hi> which are broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſo many Steps and Precipices, that they
fill the Mind with an agreeable kind of
Horror, and form one of the moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
miſ-ſhapen Scenes in the World.
The Houſe that is now in the Hands of
the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> belong'd formerly to the
Hermites of St. <hi>Maurice,</hi> and is famous
in Hiſtory for the Retreat of an
Anti-Pope, who call'd himſelf <hi>Felix</hi> the
Fifth. He had been Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
and after a very glorious Reign took on
him the Habit of a Hermite, and retired
into this Solitary Spot of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
His Enemies will have it, that he
lived here in great Eaſe and Luxury,
from whence the <hi>Italians</hi> to this Day
make uſe of the Proverb, <hi>Andare a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paglia</hi>;
and the <hi>French, Faire Ripaille,</hi> to
expreſs a delightful kind of Life. They
ſay too, that he had great Managements
with ſeveral Ecceleſiaſticks before he
turned Hermite, and that he did it in
the View of being advanced to the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate.
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0168900800:372"/>
However it was, he had not
been here half a Year before he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Pope by the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> who
took upon them to Depoſe <hi>Eugenio</hi> the
Fourth. This promiſed fair at firſt, but
by the Death of the Emperor, who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<hi>Amadeo,</hi> and the Reſolution of
<hi>Eugenio,</hi> the greateſt part of the Church
threw it ſelf again under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their depoſed Head. Our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Pope
however was ſtill ſupported by
the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and owned by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi>
               <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and a few other little
States. This Schiſm laſted in the Church
Nine Years, after which <hi>Felix</hi> voluntarily
reſigned his Title into the Hands of Pope
<hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fifth, but on the following
Conditions, That <hi>Amadeo</hi> ſhould be the
Firſt Cardinal in the Conclave; That
the Pope ſhould always receive him
ſtanding, and offer him his Mouth to
kiſs; That he ſhould be perpetual Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal-Legate
in the States of <hi>Savoy</hi> and
<hi>Switzerland,</hi> and in the Archbiſhopricks
of <hi>Geneva, Sion, Breſs,</hi> &amp;c. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That all the Cardinals of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould be recognized by the Pope.
After he had made a Peace ſo acceptable
to the Church, and ſo honourable to
himſelf, he ſpent the Remainder of his
Life with great Devotion at <hi>Ripaille,</hi>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:0168900800:373"/>
and dy'd with an extraordinary Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Sanctity.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Tonon</hi> they ſhowed us a Fountain
of Water that is in great Eſteem for its
Wholeſomneſs. They ſay it weights
Two Ounces in a Pound leſs than the
ſame Meaſure of the Lake Water, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this laſt is very good to
Drink, and as clear as can be imagined.
A little above <hi>Tonon</hi> is a Caſtle and ſmall
Garriſon. The next Day we ſaw other
ſmall Towns on the Coaſt of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi>
where there is nothing but Miſery
and Poverty. The nearer you come to
the End of the Lake the Mountains on
each ſide grow thicker and higher, 'till
at laſt they almoſt meet. One often ſees
on the Tops of the Mountains ſeveral
ſharp Rocks that ſtand above the reſt;
for as theſe Mountains have been doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
much higher than they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
the Rains have waſhed away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of the Soil, that has left the
Veins of Stone ſhooting out of them;
as in a decay'd Body the Fleſh is ſtill
ſhrinking from the Bones. The Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Hiſtories of <hi>Switzerland</hi> talk very
much of the Fall of theſe Rocks, and
the great Damage they have ſometimes
done, when their Foundations have been
mouldered with Age, or rent by an
Earthquake. We ſaw in ſeveral Parts
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0168900800:374"/>
of the <hi>Alps</hi> that bordered upon us vaſt
Pits of Snow, as ſeveral Mountains that
lye at a greater Diſtance are wholly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with it. I fancy'd the Confuſion
of Mountains and Hollows, I here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
furniſhed me with a more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Reaſon than any I have met with for
thoſe Periodical Fountains in <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which flow only at ſuch particular
Hours of the Day. For as the Tops of
theſe Mountains caſt their Shadows upon
one another, they hinder the Sun's ſhining
on ſeveral Parts at ſuch certain times, ſo
that there are ſeveral Heaps of Snow which
have the Sun lying upon them Two or
Three Hours together, and are in the
Shade all the Day afterwards. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it happens that any particular Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
takes its Riſe from any of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervoirs
of Snow, it will naturally begin
to flow on ſuch Hours of the Day as
the Snow begins to melt: but as ſoon as
the Sun leaves it again to freeze and
harden, the Fountain dries up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
no more Supplies 'till about the
ſame time the next Day, when the Heat
of the Sun again ſets the Snows a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that fall into the ſame little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits,
Traces, and Canals, and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
break out and diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
always in the ſame Place. At the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0168900800:375"/>
very Extremity of the Lake the <hi>Rhone</hi>
enters, and, when I ſaw it, brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it a prodigious Quantity of
Water; the Rivers and Lakes of this
Country being much higher in Summer
than in Winter, by reaſon of the melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Snows. One would wonder
how ſo many Learned Men could fall
into ſo great an Abſurdity, as to believe
this River could preſerve it ſelf unmix'd
with the Lake 'till its going out again
at <hi>Geneva,</hi> which is a Courſe of many
Miles. It was extreamly muddy at its
Entrance when I ſaw it, though as clear
as Rock-Water at its going out. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that it brought in much more Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than it carryed off. The River in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
preſerves it ſelf for about a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a Mile in the Lake, but is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
ſo wholly mixed, and loſt with
the Waters of the Lake, that one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
nothing like a Stream 'till within
about a Quarter of a Mile of <hi>Geneva.</hi>
From the End of the Lake to the Source
of the <hi>Rhone</hi> is a Valley of about Four
Days Journey in Length, which gives
the Name of <hi>Valleſins</hi> to its Inhabitants,
and is the Dominion of the Biſhop of
<hi>Sion.</hi> We lodged the Second Night at
<hi>Ville Neuve,</hi> a little Town in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
of <hi>Bern,</hi> where we found good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0168900800:376"/>
and a much greater Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Plenty than on the other
ſide of the Lake. The next Day, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſſed by the Caſtle of <hi>Chillon,</hi> we
came to <hi>Verſoy,</hi> another Town in the
Canton of <hi>Bern,</hi> where <hi>Ludlow</hi> retired
after having left <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Lauſanne.</hi>
The Magiſtrates of the Town warned
him out of the Firſt by the Sollicitation
of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans,</hi> as the Death
of his Friend <hi>Liſle</hi> made him quit the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
He probably choſe this Retreat
as a Place of the greateſt Safety, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an eaſie matter to know what Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
are in the Town, by Reaſon of its
Situation. The Houſe he lived in has
this Inſcription over the Door:

He is buryed in the beſt of the Churches

The Inhabitants of the
Place could give no Account of this
<hi>Broughton,</hi> but, I ſuppoſe, by his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph,
it is the ſame Perſon that was
Clerk to the pretended High Court of
Juſtice, which paſſed Sentence on the
Royal Martyr.</p>
            <p>The next Day we ſpent at <hi>Lauſanne,</hi>
the greateſt Town on the Lake, after
<hi>Geneva.</hi> We ſaw the Wall of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
Church that was opened by an
Earthquake, and ſhut again ſome Years
after by a Second. The Crack can but
be juſt diſcerned at preſent, though there
are ſeveral in the Town ſtill living who
have formerly paſſed through it. The
Duke of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> who was killed in
<hi>Savoy,</hi> lyes in this Church, but without
any Monument or Inſcription over him.
<hi>Lauſanne</hi> was once a Republick, but is
now under the Canton of <hi>Bern,</hi> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0168900800:379"/>
like the reſt of their Dominions,
by a Baily who is ſent them every Three
Years from the Senate of <hi>Bern.</hi> There
is one Street of this Town that has the
Privilege of acquitting or condemning
any Perſon of their own Body, in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Life and Death. Every Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
of it has his Vote, which makes
a Houſe here ſell better than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Part of the Town. They tell you
that not many Years ago it happened,
that a Cobler had the Caſting Vote for
the Life of a Criminal, which he very
graciouſly gave on the merciful Side.
From <hi>Lauſanne</hi> to <hi>Geneva</hi> we coaſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the Country of the <hi>Vaud,</hi> which
is the fruitfulleſt and beſt cultivated Part
of any among the <hi>Alps.</hi> It belonged for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> but was
won from him by the Canton of <hi>Bern,</hi>
and made over to it by the Treaty of St.
<hi>Julian,</hi> which is ſtill very much regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Savoyard.</hi> We called in at
<hi>Morge,</hi> where there is an artificial Port,
and a ſhow of more Trade than in any
other Town on the Lake. From <hi>Morge</hi>
we came to <hi>Nyon.</hi> The <hi>Colonia E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtris,</hi>
that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> ſettled in this
Country, is generally ſuppoſed to have
been planted in this Place. They have
often dug up old <hi>Roman</hi> Inſcriptions
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0168900800:380"/>
and Statues, and as I walked in the Town
I obſerved in the Walls of ſeveral Houſes
the Fragments of vaſt <hi>Corinthian</hi> Pillars,
with ſeveral other Pieces of Architecture,
which muſt have formerly belonged to
ſome very Noble Pile of Building. There
is no Author that mentions this Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
yet it is certain by ſeveral old <hi>Roman</hi>
Inſcriptions that there was ſuch an one.
<hi>Lucan</hi> indeed ſpeaks of a Part of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s
Army, that came to him from the
<hi>Leman</hi> Lake in the beginning of the
Civil War.<q>Deſeruere cavo tentoria fixa Lemanno.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At about Five Miles diſtance from
<hi>Nyon</hi> they ſhow ſtill the Ruins of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s
Wall, that reached eighteen Miles
in Length from Mount <hi>Jura</hi> to the
Borders of the Lake, as he has deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
it in the Firſt Book of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries.
The next Town upon the
Lake is <hi>Verſoy,</hi> which we could not
have an opportunity of ſeeing, as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the King of <hi>France.</hi> It has the
Reputation of being extremely poor and
beggarly. We ſailed from hence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
for <hi>Geneva,</hi> which makes a very
noble Show from the Lake. There are
near <hi>Geneva</hi> ſeveral Quarries of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0168900800:381"/>
that run under the Lake. When
the Water is at loweſt they make with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Borders of it a little Square en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
with Four Walls. In this Square
they ſink a Pit, and dig for Freeſtone;
the Walls hindering the Waters from
coming in upon them, when the Lake
riſes and runs on all Sides of them. The
great Convenience of Carriage makes
theſe Stones much cheaper than any
that can be found upon firm Land.
One ſees ſeveral deep Pits that have been
made at ſeveral times as one ſails over
them. As the Lake approaches <hi>Geneva</hi>
it grows ſtill narrower and narrower,
'till at laſt it changes its Name into the
<hi>Rhone,</hi> that turns all the Mills of the
Town, and is extremely rapid, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
its Waters are very deep. As
I have ſeen a great Part of the Courſe
of this River, I cannot but think it has
been guided by the particular Hand of
Providence. It riſes in the very Heart
of the <hi>Alps,</hi> and has a long Valley that
ſeems hewn out on purpoſe to give its
Waters a Paſſage amidſt ſo many Rocks
and Mountains which are on all Sides
of it. This brings it almoſt in a direct
Line to <hi>Geneva.</hi> It would there over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
all the Country, were there not
one particular Cleft that divides a vaſt
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0168900800:382"/>
Circuit of Mountains, and conveys it off
to <hi>Lyons.</hi> From <hi>Lyons</hi> there is another
great Rent, which runs acroſs the whole
Country in almoſt another ſtreight Line,
and notwithſtanding the vaſt height of
the Mountains that riſe about it, gives
it the ſhorteſt Courſe it can take to fall
into the Sea. Had ſuch a River as this
been left to it ſelf to have found its way
out from among the <hi>Alps,</hi> whatever
Windings it had made it muſt have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ſeveral little Seas, and have laid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Countries under Water before it had
come to the End of its Courſe. I ſhall
not make any Remarks upon <hi>Geneva,</hi>
that is a Republick ſo well known to
the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> It lyes at preſent under
ſome Difficulties by reaſon of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's
Diſpleaſure, who has forbidden
the Importation of their Manufactures
into any Part of the Empire, which
will certainly raiſe a Sedition among the
People, unleſs the Magiſtrates find ſome
way to remedy it: and they ſay it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done by the Interpoſition of the
States of <hi>Holland.</hi> The Occaſion of the
Emperor's Prohibition was their furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great Sums to the King of <hi>France</hi>
for the Payment of his Army in <hi>Italy.</hi>
They obliged themſelves to remit, after
the rate of Twelve Hundred Thouſand
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0168900800:383"/>
Pounds Sterling, <hi>per Annum,</hi> divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſo many Monthly Payments. As the
Intereſt was very great, ſeveral of the
Merchants of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who would not
truſt their King in their own Names,
are ſaid to have contributed a great
deal under the Names of <hi>Geneva</hi>
Merchants. The Republick fancies
it ſelf hardly treated by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
ſince it is not any Action of the
State, but a Compact among private
Perſons that hath furniſhed out theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Remittances. They pretend how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to have put a ſtop to them, and by
that means are in hopes again to open
their Commerce into the Empire.</p>

which I took the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of becauſe I do not remember to
have met with any thing of the ſame in
other Countries. It is a ſquare Place
boarded in, and filled with a vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of large Snails, that are eſteemed
excellent Food when they are well dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
The Floor is ſtrowed about half a
Foot deep with ſeveral kinds of Plants,
among which the Snails neſtle all the
Winter Seaſon. When <hi>Lent</hi> arrives they
open their Magazines, and take out of
them the beſt meagre Food in the
World, for there is no Diſh of Fiſh
that they reckon comparable to a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goût
of Snails.</p>
            <p>About Two Leagues from <hi>Fribourg</hi>
we went to ſee a Hermitage, that is
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0168900800:386"/>
reckon'd the greateſt Curioſity of theſe
Parts. It lyes in the prettieſt Solitude
imaginable, among Woods and Rocks,
which at firſt Sight diſpoſe a Man to be
ſerious. There has lived in it a Hermite
theſe Five and Twenty Years, who with
his own Hands has worked in the Rock
a pretty Chappel, a Sacriſtie, a Chamber,
Kitchin, Cellar, and other Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
His Chimney is carry'd up through
the whole Rock, ſo that you ſee
the Sky through it, notwithſtanding
the Rooms lye very deep. He has cut
the Side of the Rock into a Flat for a
Garden, and by laying on it the waſte
Earth that he has found in ſeveral of
the neighbouring Parts, has made ſuch
a Spot of Ground of it as furniſhes out
a kind of Luxury for a Hermite. As
he ſaw Drops of Water diſtilling from
ſeveral Parts of the Rock, by following
the Veins of them, he has made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Two or Three Fountains in the
Bowels of the Mountain, that ſerve his
Table, and water his little Garden.</p>
            <p>We had very bad Ways from hence
to <hi>Bern,</hi> a great Part of them through
Woods of Fir-trees. The great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Timber they have in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
makes them mend their High-ways
with Wood inſtead of Stone. I could
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0168900800:387"/>
not but take notice of the Make of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of their Barns I here ſaw. After
having laid a Frame of Wood for the
Foundation, they place at the Four
Corners of it Four huge Blocks; cut
in ſuch a Shape as neither Mice nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other ſort of Vermin can creep up
the Sides of them, at the ſame time that
they raiſe the Corn above the Moiſture
that might come into it from the Ground.
The whole weight of the Barn is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by theſe Four Blocks.</p>
            <p>What pleaſed me moſt at <hi>Bern</hi> was
their publick Walks by the Great
Church. They are raiſed extremely
high, and that their Weight might not
break down the Walls and Pilaſters
which ſurround them, they are built
upon Arches and Vaults. Tho' they are,
I believe, as high as moſt Steeples in
<hi>England</hi> from the Streets and Gardens
that lye at the Foot of them, yet about
Forty Years ago a Perſon in his Drink
fell down from the very Top to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
without doing himſelf any other
Hurt than the Breaking of an Arm.
He dy'd about Four Years ago. There
is the nobleſt Summer-Proſpect in the
World from this Walk, for you have
a full View of a huge Range of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
that lye in the Country of the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:0168900800:388"/>
and are bury'd in Snow. They
are about Twenty Five Leagues diſtance
from the Town, though by Reaſon of
their Height and their Colour they ſeem
much nearer. The Cathedral Church
ſtands on one ſide of theſe Walks, and
is perhaps the moſt Magnificent of any
Proteſtant Church in <hi>Europe</hi> out of
<hi>England.</hi> It is a very bold Work, and
a Maſter-piece in <hi>Gothic</hi> Architecture.</p>
            <p>I ſaw the Arſenal of <hi>Bern,</hi> where
they ſay there are Arms for Twenty
Thouſand Men. There is indeed no
great Pleaſure in viſiting theſe Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines
of War after one has ſeen Two
or Three of them, yet it is very well
worth a Traveller's while to look into
all that lye in his Way; for beſides the
Idea it gives him of the Forces of a
State, it ſerves to fix in his Mind the
moſt conſiderable Parts of its Hiſtory.
Thus in that of <hi>Geneva</hi> one meets with
the Ladders, Petard, and other Utenſils
which were made uſe of in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Eſcalade, beſides the Weapons they
took of the <hi>Savoyards, Florentines,</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> in the ſeveral Battels mentioned
in their Hiſtory. In this of <hi>Bern</hi> you
have the Figure and Armour of the
Count who founded the Town, of the
Famous <hi>Tell,</hi> who is repreſented as ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0168900800:389"/>
at the Apple on his Son's Head.
The Story is too well known to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in this Place. I here likewiſe
ſaw the Figure and Armour of him that
headed the Peaſants in the War upon
<hi>Bern,</hi> with the ſeveral Weapons which
were found in the Hands of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
They ſhow too abundance of Arms
that they took from the <hi>Burgundians</hi> in the
Three great Battels which eſtabliſh'd
them in their Library, and deſtroy'd the
Great Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> himſelf, with
the braveſt of his Subjects. I ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
remarkable in the Chambers where
the Council meet, nor in the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Town. Theſe laſt were
made on Occaſion of the Peaſants In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
to defend the Place for the
future againſt the like ſudden Aſſaults.
In their Liberty I obſerved a couple of
antique Figures in Metal, of a Prieſt
pouring Wine between the Horns of a
Bull. The Prieſt is veil'd after the
manner of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrificers, and
is repreſented in the ſame Action that
<hi>Virgil</hi> deſcribes in the Third <hi>Aeneid.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Ipſa tenens dextrâ pateram pulcherrima
Dido</l>
                  <l>Candentis vaccae media inter cornua fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:0168900800:390"/>
This Antiquity was found at <hi>Lauſanne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Bern</hi> is plentifully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with Water, there being a great
Multitude of handſome Fountains plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at ſet Diſtances from one End of the
Streets to the other. There is indeed
no Country in the World better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
with Water, than the ſeveral Parts
of <hi>Switzerland</hi> that I travell'd through.
One meets every where in the Roads
with Fountains continually running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
huge Troughs that ſtand underneath
them, which is wonderfully commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in a Country that ſo much abounds
with Horſes and Cattle. It has ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Springs breaking out of the Sides of
the Hills, and ſuch vaſt Quantities of
Wood to make Pipes of, that it is no
Wonder they are ſo well ſtock'd with
Fountains.</p>
            <p>On the Road between <hi>Bern</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leurre</hi>
there is a Monument erected by the
Republick of <hi>Bern,</hi> which tells us the
Story of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, who is not to
be met with in any of our own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The Inſcription is in <hi>Latin</hi> Verſe
on one ſide of the Stone, and in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
on the other. I had not Time to
Copy it, but the Subſtance of it is this.<q>One <hi>Cuſſinus,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, to
whom the Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0168900800:391"/>
his Siſter in Marriage, came to
take her from among the <hi>Swiſs</hi> by
Force of Arms, but after having ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaged
the Country for ſome time, he
was here overthrown by the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
of <hi>Bern.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soleurre</hi> is our next conſiderable Town,
that ſeemed to me to have a greater Air
of Politeneſs than any I ſaw in <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador has his
Reſidence in this Place. His Maſter
contributed a great Sum of Mony to
the Jeſuits Church, which is not yet quite
finiſhed. It is the fineſt Modern Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Switzerland.</hi> The old Cathedral
Church ſtood not far from it. At the
Aſcent that leads to it are a couple of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
Pillars which belonged to an old
Heathen Temple, Dedicated to <hi>Hermes</hi>:
They ſeem <hi>Tuſcan</hi> by their Proportion.
The whole Fortification of <hi>Soleurre</hi> is
faced with Marble. But its beſt Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
are the high Mountains that
lye within its Neighbourhood, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it from the <hi>Franche Comptè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Day's Journey carry'd us
through other Parts of the Canton of
<hi>Bern,</hi> to the little Town of <hi>Meldingen.</hi>
I was ſurpriſed to find in all my Road
through <hi>Switzerland,</hi> the Wine that
grows in the Country of <hi>Vaud</hi> on the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0168900800:392"/>
Borders of the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which
is very cheap, notwithſtanding the great
Diſtance between the Vineyards and the
Towns that ſell the Wine. But the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable
Rivers of <hi>Switzerland</hi> are as
commodious to them in this Reſpect, as
the Sea is to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> As ſoon as
the Vintage is over, they Ship off their
Wine upon the Lake, which furniſhes
all the Towns that lye upon its Borders.
What they deſign for other Parts of the
Country they unload at <hi>Very,</hi> and after
about half a Day's Land-Carriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
it into the River <hi>Aar,</hi> which brings
it down the Stream to <hi>Bern, Soleurre,</hi>
and, in a Word, diſtributes it through
all the richeſt Parts of <hi>Switzerland</hi>; as
it is eaſie to gueſs from the firſt ſight of
the Map, which ſhows us the natural
Communication Providence has formed
between the many Rivers and Lakes of a
Country that is at ſo great a diſtance from
the Sea. The Canton of <hi>Bern</hi> is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
as powerful as all the reſt together.
They can ſend a Hundred Thouſand Men
into the Field; tho' the Soldiers of the
Catholick Cantons, who are much poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and therefore forced to enter oftner
into Foreign Armies, are more eſteemed
than the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:0168900800:393"/>
We lay one Night at <hi>Meldingen,</hi> which
is a little <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Town with
one Church, and no Convent. It is a
Republick of it ſelf under the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Eight ancient Cantons. There
are in it a Hundred Bourgeois, and about
a Thouſand Souls. Their Government
is modelled after the ſame manner with
that of the Cantons, as much as ſo ſmall
a Community can imitate thoſe of ſo
large an Extent. For this Reaſon though
they have very little Buſineſs to do, they
have all the Variety of Councils and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
that are to be met with in the
greater States. They have a Town-Houſe
to meet in, adorn'd with the Arms
of the Eight Cantons their Protectors.
They have Three Councils, the Great
Council of Fourteen, the Little Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Ten, and the Privy Council of
Three. The chief of the State are the
Two Avoyers: When I was there the
Reigning Avoyer, or Doge of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
was Son to the Inn where
I was lodged. His Father having enjoy'd
the ſame Honours before him. His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
amounts to about Thirty Pound a
Year. The ſeveral Councils meet every
<hi>Thurſday</hi> upon Affairs of State, ſuch as
the Reparation of a Trough, the mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Pavement, or any the like
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0168900800:394"/>
Matters of Importance. The River that
runs through their Dominions puts them
to the Charge of a very large Bridge,
that is all made of Wood, and coped
over Head, like the reſt in <hi>Switzerland.</hi>
Thoſe that travel over it pay a certain
Due towards the Maintenance of this
Bridge. And as the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador
has often occaſion to paſs this way, his
Maſter gives the Town a Penſion of
Twenty Pound Sterling, which makes
them extremely induſtrious to raiſe all
the Men they can for his Service, and
keeps this powerful Republick firm to
the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt. You may be ſure
the Preſerving of the Bridge, with
the Regulation of the Dues ariſing
from it, is the grand Affair that cuts out
Employment for the ſeveral Councils of
State. They have a ſmall Village be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to them, whither they punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſend a Bailiff for the Diſtribution of
Juſtice; in Imitation ſtill of the Great Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons.
There are Three other Towns that
have the ſame Privileges and Protectors.</p>
            <p>We Dined the next Day at <hi>Zurich,</hi>
that is prettily ſituated on the Out-let
of the Lake, and is reckoned the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt
Town in <hi>Switzerland.</hi> The chief
Places ſhown to Strangers are the Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
the Library, and the Town-Houſe.
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0168900800:395"/>
This laſt is but lately finiſhed, and is a
very fine Pile of Building. The Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece
has Pillars of a beautiful Black
Marble ſtreaked with White, which is
found in the neighbouring Mountains.
The Chambers for the ſeveral Councils,
with the other Apartments are very neat.
The whole Building is indeed ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
that it would make a good Figure
even in <hi>Italy.</hi> It is pity they have ſpoil'd
the Beauty of the Walls with abundance
of childiſh <hi>Latin</hi> Sentences, that conſiſt
often in a Jingle of Words. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
obſerved in ſeveral Inſcriptions of
this Country, that your Men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here are extremely delighted in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
little Tricks with Words and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures;
for your <hi>Swiſs</hi> Wits are not yet
got out of Anagram and Acroſtick. The
Library is a very large Room, pretty well
filled. Over it is another Room fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with ſeveral artificial and natural
Curioſities. I ſaw in it a huge Map of
the whole Country of <hi>Zurich</hi> drawn
with a Penſil, where they ſee eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular Fountain and Hillock in
their Dominions. I ran over their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet
of Medals, but don't remember
to have met with any in it that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
rare. The Arſenal is better
than that of <hi>Bern,</hi> and they ſay has Arms
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0168900800:396"/>
for Thirty Thouſand Men. At about a
Day's Journey from <hi>Zurich</hi> we entered
on the Territories of the Abbot of St.
<hi>Gaul.</hi> They are Four Hours Riding in
Breadth, and Twelve in Length. The
Abbot can raiſe in it an Army of Twelve
Thouſand Men well armed and exerciſed.
He is Soveraign of the whole Country,
and under the Protection of the Cantons
of <hi>Zurich, Lucerne, Glaris</hi> and <hi>Switz.</hi>
He is always choſen out of the Abby of
<hi>Benedictines</hi> at St. <hi>Gaul.</hi> Every Father
and Brother of the Convent has a Voice
in the Election, which muſt afterwards
be confirmed by the Pope. The laſt
Abbot was Cardinal <hi>Sfondrati,</hi> who was
advanced to the Purple about Two
Years before his Death. The Abbot
takes the Advice and Conſent of his
Chapter before he enters on any Matter
of Importance, as the levying of a Tax,
or declaring of a War. His chief Lay-Officer
is the Grand <hi>Maître d' Hôtel,</hi> or
High-Steward of the Houſhold, who
is named by the Abbot, and has the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of all Affairs under him.
There are ſeveral other Judges and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributers
of Juſtice appointed for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Parts of his Dominions, from
whom there always lyes an Appeal to
the Prince. His Reſidence is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliy
at the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Convent at
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0168900800:397"/>
St. <hi>Gaul,</hi> notwithſtanding the Town of
St. <hi>Gaul</hi> is a little Proteſtant Republick,
wholly independent of the Abbot, and
under the Protection of the Cantons.</p>
            <p>One would wonder to ſee ſo many
rich Bourgeois in the Town of St. <hi>Gaul,</hi>
and ſo very few poor People in a Place
that has ſcarce any Lands belonging to
it, and little or no Income but what
ariſes from its Trade. But the great
Support and Riches of this little State is
its Linnen Manufacture, which employs
almoſt all Ages and Conditions of its
Inhabitants. The whole Country about
them furniſhes them with vaſt Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Flax, out of which they are ſaid
to make yearly Forty Thouſand Pieces
of Linnen Cloath, reckoning Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Ells to the Piece. Some of their
Manufacture is as finely wrought as any
that can be met with in <hi>Holland</hi>; for
they have Excellent Artizans, and great
Commodities for Whitening. All the
Fields about the Town were ſo covered
with their Manufacture, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Dusk of the Evening we
miſtook them for a Lake. They ſend off
their Works upon Mules into <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <hi>Spain, Germany,</hi> and all the adjacent
Countries. They reckon in the Town
of St. <hi>Gaul,</hi> and in the Houſes that lye
ſcattered about it, near Ten Thouſand
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0168900800:398"/>
Souls, of which there are Sixteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Burgeois. They chuſe their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and Burgo-Maſters out of the Body
of the Burgeois, as in the other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> which are every
where of the ſame Nature, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
lying only in the Numbers of
ſuch as are employed in State Affairs,
which are proportioned to the Grandeur
of the States that employ them. The
Abby and the Town bear a great Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to one another; but in the General
Diet of the Cantons their Repreſentatives
ſit together, and act by Concert. The
Abbot deputes his <hi>Grand Maître d' Hô<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,</hi>
and the Town one of its Burgo-Maſters.</p>
            <p>About Four Years ago the Town and
Abby wou'd have come to an open Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
had it not been timely prevented by
the Interpoſition of their common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors.
The Occaſion was this, A <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine</hi>
Monk, in one of their annual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions,
carried his Croſs erected through
the Town with a Train of Three or
Four Thouſand Peaſants following him.
They had no ſooner entered the Convent
but the whole Town was in a Tumult,
occaſion'd by the Inſolence of the Prieſt,
who, contrary to all Precedents, had
preſumed to carry his Croſs in that
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0168900800:399"/>
manner. The Burgeois immediately put
themſelves in Arms, and drew down
Four Pieces of their Cannon to the
Gates of the Convent. The Proceſſion
to eſcape the Fury of the Citizens durſt
not return by the Way it came, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Devotions of the Monks were
finiſh'd, paſs'd out at a Back-door of
the Convent, that immediately led into
the Abbot's Territories. The Abbot on
his Part raiſes an Army, blocks up the
Town on the Side that faces his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and forbids his Subjects to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
it with any of their Commodities.
While things were juſt ripe for a War,
the Cantons, their Protectors, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
as Umpires in the Quarrel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the Town that had appear'd
too forward in the Diſpute to a Fine of
Two Thouſand Crowns; and Enacting
at the ſame time, That as ſoon as any
Proceſſion enter'd their Walls, the Prieſt
ſhould let the Croſs hang about his
Neck without touching it with either
Hand, 'till he came within the Precincts
of the Abby. The Citizens could bring
into the Field near Two Thouſand Men
well exercis'd, and arm'd to the beſt
Advantage, with which they fancy they
could make Head againſt Twelve or
Fifteen Thouſand Peaſants, for ſo many
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0168900800:400"/>
the Abbot could eaſily raiſe in his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.
But the Proteſtant Subjects of
the Abby, who they ſay make up a good
Third of its People, would probably, in
caſe of a War, abandon the Cauſe of
their Prince for that of their Religion.
The Town of St. <hi>Gaul</hi> has an Arſenal,
Library, Town-Houſes, and Churches
proportionable to the Bigneſs of the
State. It is well enough fortify'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
any ſudden Attack, and to give the
Cantons time to come to their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
The Abby is by no means ſo
Magnificent as one would expect from
its Endowments. The Church is one
huge Nef with a double Aiſle to it. At
each End is a large Quire. The one of
them is ſupported by vaſt Pillars of
Stone, cas'd over with a Compoſition
that looks the moſt like Marble of any
thing one can imagine. On the Cieling
and Walls of the Church are Liſts of
Saints, Martyrs, Popes, Cardinals, Arch-Biſhops,
Kings and Queens that have
been of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order. There
are ſeveral Pictures of ſuch as have been
diſtinguiſh'd by their Birth, Sanctity, or
Miracles, with Inſcriptions that let you
into the Name and Hiſtory of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
repreſented. I have often wiſh'd
that ſome Traveller would take the Pains
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0168900800:401"/>
to gather together all the Modern In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
which are to be met with in
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Countries, as <hi>Gruter</hi>
and others have copy'd out the ancient
Heathen Monuments. Had we Two
or Three Volumes of this Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any of the Collector's own Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
I am ſure there is nothing in the
World could give a truer Idea of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, nor expoſe
more the Pride, Vanity and Self-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of Convents, the Abuſe of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
the Folly and Impertinence of
Votaries, and in ſhort the Superſtition,
Credulity, and Childiſhneſs of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Catholick Religion. One might
fill ſeveral Sheets at St. <hi>Gaul,</hi> as there
are few conſiderable Convents or
Churches that would not afford large
Contributions.</p>
            <p>As the King of <hi>France</hi> diſtributes his
Penſions through all the Parts of <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi>
the Town and Abby of St. <hi>Gaul</hi>
come in too for their Share. To the
Firſt he gives Five Hundred Crowns
<hi>per Annum,</hi> and to the other a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.
This Penſion has not been paid
theſe Three Years, which they attribute
to their not acknowledging the Duke
of <hi>Anjou</hi> for King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Town
and Abby of St. <hi>Gaul</hi> carry a Bear for
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0168900800:402"/>
their Arms. The <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks
have this Bear's Memory in very great
Veneration, and repreſent him as the
firſt Convert their Saint made in the
Country. One of the moſt Learned of
the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks gave me the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Hiſtory of him, which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to me with Tears of Affection in
his Eyes. St. <hi>Gaul</hi> it ſeems, whom they
call the great Apoſtle of <hi>Germany,</hi> found
all this Country little better than a vaſt
Deſart. As he was walking in it on a
very cold Day he chanc'd to meet a Bear
in his Way. The Saint, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtartled at the Rencounter, order'd
the Bear to bring him a Bundle of Wood,
and make him a Fire. The Bear ſerv'd
him to the beſt of his Ability, and at
his Departure was commanded by the
Saint to retire into the very Depth of
the Woods, and there to paſs the reſt of
his Life without ever hurting Man or
Beaſt. From this time, ſays the Monk,
the Bear liv'd irreproachably, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
to his dying Day the Orders that
the Saint had given him.</p>
            <p>I have often conſider'd, with a great
deal of Pleaſure, the profound Peace
and Tranquillity that reigns in <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and its Alliances. It is very won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
to ſee ſuch a Knot of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0168900800:403"/>
which are ſo divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in Matters of Religion, maintain
ſo uninterrupted an Union and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondance,
that no one of them is for
Invading the Rights of another, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
content within the Bounds of its
Firſt Eſtabliſhment. This, I think, muſt
be chiefly aſcribed to the Nature of the
People, and the Conſtitution of their
Governments. Were the <hi>Swiſs</hi> animated
by Zeal or Ambition, ſome or other of
their States would immediately break in
upon the reſt; or were the States ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Principalities, they might often have
an ambitious Soveraign at the Head of
them, that would embroil his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and ſacrifice the Repoſe of his
Subjects to his own Glory. But as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of theſe Countries are naturally
of a heavy Phlegmatick Temper, if any
of their leading Members have more Fire
and Spirit than comes to their Share, it
is quickly temper'd by the Coldneſs and
Moderation of the reſt who ſit at the
Helm with them. To this we may add,
that the <hi>Alps</hi> is the worſt Spot of
Ground in the World to make Conqueſts
in, a great Part of its Governments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo naturally intrench'd among Woods
and Mountains. However it be, we
find no ſuch Diſorders among them as
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0168900800:404"/>
one would expect in ſuch a Multitude
of States; for as ſoon as any Publick
Rupture happens, it is immediately clos'd
up by the Moderation and good Offices
of the reſt that interpoſe.</p>
            <p>As all the conſiderable Governments
among the <hi>Alps</hi> are Common-wealths,
ſo indeed it is a Conſtitution the moſt
adapted of any other to the Poverty
and Barrenneſs of theſe Countries. We
may ſee only in a neighbouring Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the ill Conſequences of having a
Deſpotic Prince, in a State that is moſt
of it compoſed of Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
for notwithſtanding there is a
vaſt Extent of Lands, and many of them
better than thoſe of the <hi>Swiſs</hi> and <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
the common People, among the
latter, are much more at their Eaſe, and
in a greater Affluence of all the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of Life. A Prince's Court eats
too much into the Income of a poor
State, and generally introduces a kind
of Luxury and Magnificence, that ſets
every particular Perſon upon making a
higher Figure in his Station than is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
conſiſtent with his Revenue.</p>
            <p>It is the great Endeavour of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Cantons of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> to baniſh
from among them every thing that looks
like Pomp or Superfluity. To this End
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0168900800:405"/>
the Miniſters are always Preaching, and
the Governors putting out Edicts againſt
Dancing, Gaming, Entertainments, and
fine Cloaths. This is become more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
in ſome of the Governments,
ſince there are ſo many Refugees ſettled
among them; for tho' the Proteſtants
in <hi>France</hi> affect ordinarily a greater Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Simplicity of Manners, than
thoſe of the ſame Quality who are of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Communion, they
have however too much of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Gallantry
for the Genius and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of <hi>Switzerland.</hi> Should Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
Feaſting, and Balls once get among
the Cantons, their Military Roughneſs
would be quickly loſt, their Tempers
would grow too ſoft for their Climate,
and their Expences out-run their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes,
beſides that the Materials for
their Luxury muſt be brought from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations, which would immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ruin a Country that has few Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of its own to export, and is not
over-ſtock'd with Mony. Luxury in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
wounds a Republick in its very Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
as its natural Conſequences are Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
Avarice and Injuſtice; for the
more Mony a Man ſpends, the more
muſt he endeavour to augment his
Stock; which at laſt ſets the Liberty
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0168900800:406"/>
and Votes of a Common-wealth to Sale,
if they find any Foreign Power that is
able to pay the Price of them. We ſee no
where the pernicious Effects of Luxury
on a Republick more than in that of
the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> who immediately
found it ſelf poor as ſoon as this Vice
got Footing among them, though they
were poſſeſs'd of all the Riches in the
World. We find in the Beginnings
and Increaſes of their Common-wealth
ſtrange Inſtances of the Contempt of
Mony, becauſe indeed they were utter
Strangers to the Pleaſures that might be
procured by it; or in other Words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were wholly ignorant of the
Arts of Luxury. But as ſoon as they
once enter'd into a Taſte of Pleaſure,
Politeneſs and Magnificence, they fell
into a Thouſand Violences, Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and Diviſions that threw them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the Diſorders imaginable, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
in the utter Subverſion of the
Common-wealth. It is no wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the poor Common-wealths of <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi>
are ever labouring at the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
and Prohibition of every thing
that may introduce Vanity and Luxury.
Beſide the ſeveral Fines that are ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Plays, Games, Balls and Feaſtings,
they have many Cuſtoms among them
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0168900800:407"/>
which very much contribute to the
keeping up of their ancient Simplicity.
The Bourgeois, who are at the Head
of the Governments, are obliged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at all their publick Aſſemblies in a
Black Cloak and a Band. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Dreſs is very plain, thoſe of the
beſt Quality wearing nothing on their
Heads generally but Furs, which are to
be met with in their own Country.
The Perſons of different Qualities in
both Sexes are indeed allowed their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Ornaments, but theſe are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſuch as are by no means coſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rather deſigned as Marks of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
than to make a Figure. The
chief Officers of <hi>Bern,</hi> for Example,
are known by the Crowns of their Hats,
which are much deeper than thoſe of
an inferior Character. The Peaſants are
generally cloathed in a coarſe kind of
Canvas, that is the Manufacture of the
Country. Their Holy-day Cloaths go
from Father to Son, and are ſeldom worn
out, 'till the Second or Third Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
So that it is common enough to
ſee a Countryman in the Doublet and
Breeches of his Great-grand-father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geneva</hi> is much politer than <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or any of its Allies, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
looked upon as the Court of the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0168900800:408"/>
               <hi>Alps,</hi> whither the Proteſtant Cantons
often ſend their Children to improve
themſelves in Language and Education.
The <hi>Genevois</hi> have been very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd,
or as others will have it, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Converſation of the <hi>French</hi>
Proteſtants, who make up almoſt a Third
of their People. It is certain they have
very much forgotten the Advice that
<hi>Calvin</hi> gave them in a great Council a
little before his Death, when he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to them, above all Things, an
Exemplary Modeſty and Humility, and
as great a Simplicity in their Manners
as in their Religion. Whether or no
they have done well, to ſet up for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another kind of Figure, Time will
witneſs. There are ſeveral that fancy
the great Sums they have remitted into
<hi>Italy,</hi> though by this means they make
their Court to the King of <hi>France</hi> at
preſent, may ſome time or other give
him an Inclination to become the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of ſo wealthy a City.</p>
            <p>As this Collection of little States a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
more in Paſturage than in Corn,
they are all provided with their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Granaries, and have the Humanity
to furniſh one another in publick Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
when the Scarcity is not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.
As the Adminiſtration of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0168900800:409"/>
relating to theſe publick Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
is not very different in any of the
particular Governments, I ſhall content
my ſelf to ſet down the Rules obſerved
in it by the little Common-wealth of
<hi>Geneva,</hi> in which I had more Time to
inform my ſelf of the Particulars than
in any other. There are Three of the
Little Council deputed for this Office.
They are obliged to keep together a
Proviſion ſufficient to feed the People
at leaſt Two Years, in caſe of War or
Famine. They muſt take care to fill
their Magazines in Times of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Plenty, that ſo they may afford cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and increaſe the publick Revenue
at a ſmall Expence of its Members.
None of the Three Managers muſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any Pretence, furniſh the Granaries
from his own Fields, that ſo they may
have no Temptation to pay too great
a Price, or put any bad Corn upon the
Publick. They muſt buy up no Corn
growing within Twelve Miles of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
that ſo the filling of their Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines
may not prejudice their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
and raiſe the Price of their Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
at Home. That ſuch a Collection
of Corn may not ſpoil in keeping, all
the Inns and Publick-Houſes are obliged
to furniſh themſelves out of it, by which
means is raiſed the moſt conſiderable
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0168900800:410"/>
Branch of the publick Revenues; the
Corn being ſold out at a much dearer
Rate than 'tis bought up. So that the
greateſt Income of the Common-wealth,
which pays the Penſions of moſt of
its Officers and Miniſters, is raiſed on
Strangers and Travellers, or ſuch of their
own Body as have Mony enough to
ſpend at Taverns and Publick-Houſes.</p>
            <p>It is the Cuſtom in <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi>
to divide their Eſtates equally
among all their Children, by which
means every one lives at his Eaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
growing dangerous to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
for as ſoon as an overgrown E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
falls into the Hands of one that
has many Children, it is broken into ſo
many Portions as render the Sharers of
it Rich enough, without raiſing them
too much above the Level of the reſt.
This is abſolutely neceſſary in theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Republicks, where the Rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
live very much within their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
and by heaping up vaſt Sums
from Year to Year might become for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
to the reſt of their Fellow-Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
and break the Equality, which is
ſo neceſſary in theſe kinds of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
were there not means found out
to diſtribute their Wealth among ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Members of their Republick. At
<hi>Geneva,</hi> for Inſtance, are Merchants
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0168900800:411"/>
reckon'd worth Twenty Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Crowns, though, perhaps, there
is not one of them who ſpends to the
value of Five Hundred Pounds a Year.</p>
            <p>Though the Proteſtants and Papiſts
know very well that it is their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intereſt to keep a ſteddy Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in all the Wars between the States
of <hi>Europe,</hi> they cannot forbear ſiding
with a Party in their Diſcourſe. The
Catholicks are zealous for the <hi>French</hi>
King, as the Proteſtants do not a little
glory in the Riches, Power, and good
Succeſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> whom
they look upon as the Bulwarks of the
Reformation. The Miniſters in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
have often preached againſt ſuch
of their Fellow-Subjects as enter into
the Troops of the <hi>French</hi> King; but ſo
long as the <hi>Swiſs</hi> ſee their Intereſt in it,
their Poverty will always hold them
faſt to his Service. They have indeed
the Exerciſe of their Religion, and
their Miniſters with them, which is the
more remarkable, becauſe the very ſame
Prince, refuſed even thoſe of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> who follow'd their Maſter
to St. <hi>Germains,</hi> the publick Exerciſe
of their Religion.</p>
            <p>Before I leave <hi>Switzerland</hi> I cannot
but obſerve, that the Notion of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0168900800:412"/>
reigns very much in this Country.
I have often been tired with Accounts
of this Nature from very ſenſible Men,
that are moſt of them furniſh'd with
Matters of Fact which have happened,
as they pretend, within the compaſs of
their own Knowledge. It is certain
there have been many Executions on this
Account, as in the Canton of <hi>Bern</hi> there
were ſome put to Death during my
Stay at <hi>Geneva.</hi> The People are ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally
infatuated with the Notion,
that if a Cow falls ſick, it is Ten to
One but an Old Woman is clapt up in
Priſon for it, and if the poor Creature
chance to think her ſelf a Witch, the
whole Country is for hanging her up
without Mercy. One finds indeed the
ſame Humour prevail in moſt of the
rocky Barren Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be that Poverty and Ignorance,
which are generally the Products of
theſe Countries, may really engage a
Wretch in ſuch dark Practices, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no the ſame Principles may not
render the People too credulous, and
perhaps too eaſy to get rid of ſome of
their unprofitable Members.</p>
            <p>A great Affair that employs the <hi>Swiſs</hi>
Politicks at preſent is the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi>'s
Succeſſion to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:0168900800:413"/>
in the Government of <hi>Neuf-Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</hi>
The Inhabitants of <hi>Neuf-Chatel</hi> can
by no means think of ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to a Prince who is a <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
and a Subject of <hi>France.</hi> They
were very attentive to his Conduct in
the Principality of <hi>Orange,</hi> which they
did not queſtion but he would Rule with
all the Mildneſs and Moderation imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as it would be the beſt Means in the
World to recommend him to <hi>Neuf-Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</hi>
But notwithſtanding it was ſo much
his Intereſt to manage his Proteſtant
Subjects in that Country, and the ſtrong
Aſſurances he had given them in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
them in all their Privileges, and
particularly in the free Exerciſe of their
Religion, he made over his Principality
in a very little time for a Sum of Mony
to the King of <hi>France.</hi> It is indeed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
believed the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> would
rather ſtill have kept his Title to <hi>Orange,</hi>
but the ſame Reſpect which induced him
to quit this Government, might at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time tempt him to give up that of
<hi>Neuf-Chatel</hi> on the like Conditions. The
King of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> lays in his claim for
<hi>Neuf-Chatel,</hi> as he did for the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>Orange,</hi> and 'tis probable would
be more acceptable to the Inhabitants
than the other, but they are generally
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0168900800:414"/>
diſpos'd to declare themſelves a Free
Common-wealth, after the Death of the
Dutcheſs of <hi>Nemours,</hi> if the <hi>Swiſs</hi> will
ſupport them. The Proteſtant Cantons
ſeem much inclin'd to aſſiſt them, which
they may very well do, in caſe the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs
dies whilſt the King of <hi>France</hi> has
his Hands ſo full of Buſineſs on all ſides
of him. It certainly very much concerns
them not to ſuffer the <hi>French</hi> King to
Eſtabliſh his Authority on this ſide
Mount <hi>Jura,</hi> and on the very Borders
of their Country; but it is not eaſie to
foreſee what a round Sum of Mony,
or the Fear of a Rupture with <hi>France,</hi>
may do among a People who have
tamely ſuffer'd the <hi>Franche Comptè</hi> to
be ſeiz'd on, and a Fort to be built
within Cannon-ſhot of one of their
Cantons.</p>
            <p>There is a new Sect ſprung up in
<hi>Switzerland,</hi> which ſpreads very much
in the Proteſtant Cantons. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of it call themſelves <hi>Pietiſts,</hi> and
as Enthuſiaſm carries Men generally to
the like Extravagancies, they differ but
little from ſeveral Sectaries in other
Countries. They pretend in general to
great Refinements, as to what regards
the Practice of Chriſtianity, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the following Rules. To retire
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0168900800:415"/>
much from the Converſation of the
World. To ſink themſelves into an
entire Repoſe and Tranquillity of Mind.
In this State of Silence to attend the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Illapſe and Flowings in of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, that may fill their Minds with
Peace and Conſolation, Joys or Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
To favour all his ſecret Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and give themſelves up entirely
to his Conduct and Direction, ſo as
neither to ſpeak, move, or act, but as
they find his Impulſe on their Souls.
To retrench themſelves within the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
and Neceſſities of Life. To
make a Covenant with all their Senſes,
ſo far as to ſhun the Smell of a Roſe or
Violet, and to turn away their Eyes from
a beautiful Proſpect. To avoid, as much
as is poſſible, what the World calls In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Pleaſures, leſt they ſhould have
their Affections tainted by any Senſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and diverted from the Love of him
who is to be the only Comfort, Repoſe,
Hope, and Delight, of their whole Beings.
This Sect prevails very much among the
Proteſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> as well as thoſe
of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and has occaſion'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Edicts againſt it in the Dutchy
of <hi>Saxony.</hi> The Profeſſors of it are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
of all the ill Practices which may
ſeem to be the Conſequence of their
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0168900800:416"/>
Principles, as that they aſcribe the worſt
of Actions, which their own vicious
Tempers throw them upon, to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of the Holy Spirit; that both
Sexes under Pretence of Devout Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
viſit one another at all Hours,
and in all Places, without any regard to
common Decency, often making their
Religion a Cover for their Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and that the very beſt of them are
poſſeſs'd with Spiritual Pride, and a
Contempt for all ſuch as are not of their
own Sect. The <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, who
reproach the Proteſtants for their break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into ſuch a Multitude of Religions,
have certainly taken the moſt effectual
way in the World for the keeping their
Flocks together; I don't mean the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
they inflict on Mens Perſons,
which are commonly look'd upon as the
chief Methods by which they deter them
from breaking through the Pale of the
Church, though certainly theſe lay a
very great Reſtraint on thoſe of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Perſuaſion. But I
take one great Cauſe why there are ſo
few Sects in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to
be the Multitude of Convents, with which
they every where abound, that ſerve as
Receptacles for all thoſe fiery Zealots
who would ſet the Church in a Flame,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0168900800:417"/>
were not they got together in theſe
Houſes of Devotion. All Men of dark
Tempers, according to their Degree of
Melancholy or Enthuſiaſm, may find
Convents fitted to their Humours, and
meet with Companions as gloomy as
themſelves. So that what the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
would call a Fanatick, is in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church a Religious of ſuch or
ſuch an Order; as I have been told of
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome great Diſappointments in the
World was reſolv'd to turn Quaker or
Capuchin; for, in the Change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Men of ordinary Underſtandings
don't ſo much conſider the Principles,
as the Practice of thoſe to whom they
go over.</p>
            <p>From St. <hi>Gaul</hi> I took Horſe to the
Lake of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which lyes at Two
Leagues Diſtance from it, and is form'd
by the Entry of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> This is the
only Lake in <hi>Europe</hi> that diſputes for
Greatneſs with that of <hi>Geneva</hi>; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
more beautiful to the Eye, but
wants the fruitful Fields and Vineyards
that border upon the other. It receives
its Name from <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the chief Town
on its Banks. When the Cantons of
<hi>Bern</hi> and <hi>Zurich</hi> propoſed, at a general
Diet, the Incorporating <hi>Geneva</hi> in the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0168900800:418"/>
Number of the Cantons, the <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholick Party, fearing the Proteſtant
Intereſt might receive by it too great a
Strengthning, propoſed at the ſame time
the Incantoning of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> as a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe;
to which the Proteſtants not
conſenting, the whole Project fell to
the Ground. We croſs'd the Lake to
<hi>Lindaw,</hi> and in ſeveral Parts of it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
abundance of little Bubbles of
Air, that came working upward from
the very Bottom of the Lake. The
Watermen told us, that they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
always to riſe in the ſame Places,
from whence they conclude them to be
ſo many Springs that break out of the
Bottom of the Lake. <hi>Lindaw</hi> is an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Town on a little Iſland that lyes
at about Three Hundred Paces from the
firm Land, to which it is join'd by a
huge Bridge of Wood. The Inhabitants
were all in Arms when we paſs'd through
it, being under great Apprehenſions of
the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> after his having
fallen upon <hi>Ulm</hi> and <hi>Memminghen.</hi> They
flatter themſelves, that by cutting their
Bridge they could hold out againſt his
Army: But, in all Probability, a Shower
of Bombs would quickly reduce the
Burgeois to Surrender. They were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
Bombarded by <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus.</hi>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:0168900800:419"/>
We were advis'd by our Merchants, by
no means to venture our ſelves in the
Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Country, ſo that we
had the Mortification to loſe the Sight
of <hi>Munich, Ausburg,</hi> and <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> and
were forced to take our Way to <hi>Vienna</hi>
through the <hi>Tirol,</hi> where we had very
little to Entertain us beſides the natural
Face of the Country.</p>

Wooden Palace that borders on the
other, whither the Court uſed to retire
at the firſt ſhake of an Earthquake. I
ſaw here the largeſt Menage that I have
met with any where elſe. At one End
of it is a great Partition deſigned for an
Opera. They ſhowed us alſo a very
pretty Theatre. The laſt Comedy that
was acted on it was deſigned by the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
for the Entertainment of the Queen
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who paſs'd this way from
<hi>Hanover</hi> to <hi>Vienna.</hi> The Compliment
which the Fathers made her Majeſty on

did not a little expoſe them to the
Raillery of the Court. For the Arms of

thought it a very pretty Alluſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
the Queen by <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> that
would let no Body get upon him but

There is in the middle of them a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Statue in Braſs of an Arch-Duke
<hi>Leopold</hi> on Horſeback. There are near
it Twelve other Figures of Water-Nymphs
and River-Gods well Caſt, and
as big as the Life. They were deſigned
for the Ornaments of a Water-Work,
as one might eaſily make a great Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of Jetteaus at a ſmall Expence in a
Garden that has the River <hi>Inn</hi> running
by its Walls. The late Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
had this Palace, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Tirol</hi> aſſigned him by the
Emperor, and his Lady the Queen Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager
of <hi>Poland</hi> lived here ſeveral Years
after the Death of the Duke her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
There are covered Galleries that
lead from the Palace to Five different
Churches. I paſſed through a very long
one which reaches to the Church of the
<hi>Capucin</hi> Convent, where the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> uſed often to aſſiſt at their Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
Devotions. They ſhowed us in
this Convent the Apartments of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian,</hi>
who was Arch-Duke and Count
of <hi>Tirol</hi> about Fourſcore Years ago. This
Prince at the ſame time that he kept the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0168900800:423"/>
Government in his Hands, lived in this
Convent with all the Rigor and Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a <hi>Capucin.</hi> His Anti-Chamber
and Room of Audience are little ſquare
Chambers Wainſcoated. His private
Lodgings are Three or Four ſmall
Rooms faced with a kind of Fret-work,
that makes them look like little Hollow
Caverns in a Rock. They preſerve this
Apartment of the Convent uninhabited,
and ſhow in it the Altar, Bed and Stove,
as likewiſe a Picture and a Stamp of this
Devout Prince. The Church of the
<hi>Franciſcan</hi> Convent is famous for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> the
Firſt, which ſtands in the midſt of it. It
was erected to him by his Grand-Son
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Firſt, who probably looked
upon this Emperor as the Founder of
the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Greatneſs. For as by his
own Marriage he annexed the Low-Countries
to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſo
by matching his Son to <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>
he ſettled on his Poſterity the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and by the Marriage of
his Grand-Son <hi>Ferdinand</hi> got into his
Family the Kingdoms of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and
<hi>Hungary.</hi> This Monument is only Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary,
for the Aſhes of the Emperor
lye elſewhere. On the Top of it is a
Brazen Figure of <hi>Maximilian</hi> on his
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0168900800:424"/>
Knees, and on the Sides of it a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Bas Relief</hi> repreſenting the Actions
of this Prince. His whole Hiſtory is
digeſted into Twenty Four ſquare Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
of Sculpture in <hi>Bas Relief</hi>: The
Subject of Two of them is his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
with <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and the
Wars they made together upon <hi>France.</hi>
On each Side of this Monument is a
Row of very noble Brazen Statues much
bigger than the Life, moſt of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
ſuch as were ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
related to <hi>Maximilian.</hi> Among the
reſt is one that the Fathers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
tell us repreſents King <hi>Arthur</hi> the
old <hi>Britiſh</hi> King. But what Relation
had that <hi>Arthur</hi> to <hi>Maximilian</hi>? I don't
queſtion therefore but it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
for Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed
<hi>Catharine,</hi> Siſter of <hi>Maximilian,</hi>
whoſe Divorce afterwards gave occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſuch ſignal Revolutions in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
This Church was built by <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
the Firſt. One ſees in it a kind of Offer at
Modern Architecture, but at the ſame
time that the Architect has ſhown his
Diſlike of the <hi>Gothick</hi> manner, one may
ſee very well that in that Age they were
not, at leaſt in this Country, arrived
at the Knowledge of the true Way.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0168900800:425"/>
The Portal, for Example, conſiſts of a
compoſite Order unknown to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents;
the Ornaments indeed are taken
from them, but ſo put together that you
ſee the Volutes of the <hi>Ionic,</hi> the Foliage
of the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> and the Uovali of the
<hi>Doric</hi> mix'd without any Regularity on
the ſame Capital. So the Vault of the
Church, tho' broad enough, is encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
with too many little Tricks in
Sculpture. It is indeed ſupported with
ſingle Columns inſtead of thoſe vaſt
Cluſters of little Pillars that one meets
with in <hi>Gothic</hi> Cathedrals, but at the
ſame time theſe Columns are of no regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Order, and at leaſt Twice too long
for their Diameter. There are other
Churches in the Town, and Two or
Three Palaces which are of a more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Make, and built with a good Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
I was ſhown the little <hi>Notredame</hi>
that is handſomly deſign'd, and topp'd
with a Cupola. It was made as an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of Gratitude to the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
for having defended the Country
of the <hi>Tirol</hi> againſt the Victorious Arms
of <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> who could not
enter this Part of the Empire after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
over-run moſt of the reſt. This
Temple was therefore built by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
of the whole Country. At
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0168900800:426"/>
about half a League's diſtance from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpruck</hi>
ſtands the Caſtle of <hi>Amras,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with a prodigious Quantity of
Medals, and many other ſorts of Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
both in Nature and Art, for which
I muſt refer the Reader to Monſieur <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>'s
Account in his Letter to the Duke
of <hi>Wirtemburg,</hi> having my ſelf had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Time or Opportunity to enter into
a particular Examination of them.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Inſpruck</hi> we came to <hi>Hall,</hi> that
lyes at a League diſtance on the ſame
River. This Place is particularly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for its Salt-Works. There are in
the Neighbourhood vaſt Mountains of
a tranſparent kind of Rock not unlike
Allum, extreamly ſolid, and as piquant
to the Tongue as Salt it ſelf. Four or
Five Hundred Men are always at Work
in theſe Mountains, where as ſoon as
they have hewn down any Quantities of
the Rock they let in their Springs and
Reſervoirs among their Works. The
Water eats away and diſſolves the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Salt which are mix'd in the
Stone, and is convey'd by long Troughs
and Canals from the Mines to the Town
of <hi>Hall,</hi> where 'tis received in vaſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns,
and boil'd off from time to
time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:0168900800:427"/>
They make after the rate of Eight
Hundred Loaves a Week, each Loaf
Four Hundred Pound Weight. This
would raiſe a great Revenue to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
were there here ſuch a Tax on
Salt as there is in <hi>France.</hi> At preſent he
clears but Two Hundred Thouſand
Crowns a Year, after having defray'd
all the Charges of working it. There
are in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and other Parts of
the <hi>Alps,</hi> ſeveral of theſe Quarries of
Salt that turn to very little Account, by
Reaſon of the great Quantities of Wood
they conſume.</p>
            <p>The Salt-Works at <hi>Hall</hi> have a great
Convenience for Fuel which ſwims down
to them on the River <hi>Inn.</hi> This Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
during its Courſe through the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol,</hi>
is generally ſhut up between a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Range of Mountains that are moſt
of them cover'd with Woods of Fir-Trees.
Abundance of Peaſants are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in the hewing down of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
of theſe Trees, that, after they are
Bark'd and cut into Shape, are tumbled
down from the Mountains into the
Stream of the River, which carries them
off to the Salt-Works. At <hi>Inſpruck</hi>
they take up vaſt Quantities for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
and publick Officers, who have a
certain Portion of it alloted them by the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0168900800:428"/>
Emperor: the reſt of it paſſes on to
<hi>Hall.</hi> There are generally ſeveral Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Loads afloat, for they begin to cut
above Twenty Five Leagues up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
above <hi>Hall,</hi> and there are other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
that flow into the <hi>Inn,</hi> which bring
in their Contributions. Theſe Salt-Works,
and a Mint that is eſtabliſh'd at
the ſame Place, have render'd this Town,
notwithſtanding the Neighbourhood of
the Capital City, almoſt as populous as
<hi>Inſpruck</hi> it ſelf. The Deſign of this
Mint is to work off part of the Metals
which are found in the neighbouring
Mountains; where, as we were told,
there are Seven Thouſand Men in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Employ. At <hi>Hall</hi> we took a Boat
to carry us to <hi>Vienna.</hi> The Firſt Night
we lay at <hi>Rottenburg,</hi> where is a ſtrong
Caſtle above the Town. Count <hi>Serini</hi>
is ſtill cloſe Priſoner in this Caſtle, who,
as they told us in the Town, had loſt his
Senſes by his long Impriſonment and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.
The next Day we Din'd at
<hi>Kuff-ſtain,</hi> where there is a Fortreſs on
a high Rock above the Town almoſt
inacceſſible on all Sides: This being
a Frontier Place on the Dutchy of
<hi>Bavaria,</hi> where we enter'd after about
an Hour's Rowing from <hi>Kuff-ſtain.</hi> It
was the pleaſanteſt Voyage in the World
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0168900800:429"/>
to follow the Windings of this River
<hi>Inn</hi> through ſuch a Variety of pleaſing
Scenes as the Courſe of it naturally led
us. We had ſometimes on each Side
us a vaſt Extent of naked Rocks and
Mountains, broken into a Thouſand ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
Steeps and Precipices; in other
Places we ſaw a long Foreſt of Fir-Trees
ſo thick ſet together, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to diſcover any of the Soil they
grew upon, and riſing up ſo regularly
one above another, as to give us the
View of a whole Wood at once. The
time of the Year, that had given the
Leaves of the Trees ſo many different
Colours, compleated the Beauty of the
Proſpect. But as the Materials of a fine
Landskip are not always the moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Owner of them, we met
with but very little Corn or Paſturage
for the Proportion of Earth that we
paſs'd through, the Lands of the <hi>Tirol</hi>
not being able to feed the Inhabitants.
This long Valley of the <hi>Tirol</hi> lyes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
on all Sides by the <hi>Alps,</hi> tho'
its Dominions ſhoot out into ſeveral
Branches that lye among the Breaks and
Hollows of the Mountains. It is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by Three Councils reſiding at
<hi>Inſpruck,</hi> one ſits upon Life and Death,
the other is for Taxes and Impoſitions,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0168900800:430"/>
and a third for the common Diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Juſtice. As theſe Courts regulate
themſelves by the Orders they receive
from the Imperial Court, ſo in many
Caſes there are Appeals from them to
<hi>Vienna.</hi> The Inhabitants of the <hi>Tirol</hi>
have many particular Privileges above
thoſe of the other Hereditary Countries
of the Emperor. For as they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
well fortify'd among their Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and at the ſame time border upon
many different Governments, as the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
               <hi>Venetians, Swiſs, Bavarians,</hi> &amp;c.
a ſevere Treatment might tempt them
to ſet up for a Republick, or at leaſt
throw themſelves under the milder Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of ſome of their Neighbours:
Beſides that their Country is poor, and
that the Emperor draws conſiderable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
out of its Mines of Salt and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
They are theſe Mines that fill the
Country with greater Numbers of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
than it would be able to bear
without the Importation of Corn from
Foreign Parts. The Emperor has Forts
and Cittadels at the Entrance of all the
Paſſes that lead into the <hi>Tirol,</hi> which
are ſo advantagiouſly placed upon Rocks
and Mountains, that they command all
the Vallies and Avenues that lye about
them. Beſides, that the Country it ſelf
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0168900800:431"/>
is cut into ſo many Hills and Inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as would render it defenſible by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little Army againſt a numerous Enemy.
It was therefore generally thought the
Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> would not attempt
the cutting off any Succours that were
ſent to Prince <hi>Eugene</hi>; or the forcing
his Way through the <hi>Tirol</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi>
The River <hi>Inn,</hi> that had hitherto been
ſhut up among Mountains, paſſes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
through a wide open Country dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all its Courſe through <hi>Bavaria,</hi>
which is a Voyage of Two Days, after
the rate of Twenty Leagues a Day.</p>
