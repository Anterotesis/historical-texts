            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A Large and elegant bridge, forming a way over a broad and rapid river, is juſtly eſteemed one of the nobleſt pieces of mechaniſm that man is capable of performing. And the uſefulneſs of an art which, at the ſame time that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nects diſtant ſhores by a way over the deep and rapid waters, alſo allows thoſe waters and their navigation to paſs ſmooth and uninterrupted, renders all probable attempts to advance the theory or practice of it, highly deſerving the encouragement of the public.</p>
            <p>This little book is offered as an attempt towards the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the theory of this art, in which the properties, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, proportions, and other relations of the various parts of a bridge, are ſtrictly demonſtrated, and clearly illuſtrated by various examples. It is divided into five ſections: the <hi>1ſt</hi> treats on the projects of bridges, containing a regular detail of the various circumſtances and conſiderations that are cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizable in ſuch projects: The <hi>2d</hi> treats on arches, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating their various properties, with the relations between their intrados and extrados, and clearly diſtinguiſhes the moſt preferable curves to be uſed in a bridge; the firſt two or three propoſitions being inſtituted after the manner of two or three done by Mr. Emerſon in his Fluxions and Mechanics: The <hi>3d</hi> ſection treats on the piers, demonſtrating their thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs neceſſary for ſupporting any kind of an arch, ſpringing at any height, and that both when part of the pier is ſuppoſed to be immerſed in water, and when otherwiſe: The <hi>4th</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates the force of the water againſt the end or face of the pier, conſidered as of different forms; with the beſt form for dividing the ſtream, &amp;c. and to it is added a table ſhewing the ſeveral heights of the fall of the water under the arches, ariſing from its velocity and the obſtruction of the piers; as it was compoſed by Tho. Wright, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Auckland, in the county of Durham, who informs me it is part of a word on which he has ſpent much time, and with which he intends to favour the public: And the <hi>5th</hi> and laſt ſection contains a dictionary of the moſt material terms peculiar to the ſubject;
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1182400700:3"/>in which many practical obſervations and directions are given, which could not be ſo regularly nor properly introduced into the former ſections. The whole, it is preſumed, containing full directions for conſtituting and adapting to one another, the ſeveral eſſential parts of a bridge, ſo as to make it the ſtrongeſt; and the moſt convenient, both for the paſſage over and under it, that the ſituation and other circumſtances will poſſibly admit: not indeed for the actual methods of diſpoſing the ſtones, making of mortar, or the external ornaments, &amp;c. thoſe things I do not deſcend to, but leave to the diſcretion of the practical architect, as being no part of the plan of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; and for the ſame reaſon alſo I have given no views of bridges, but only prints of ſuch parts or figures as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in explaining the elementary parts of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>As my profeſſion is not that of an architect, very probably I ſhould never have turned my thoughts to this ſubject, ſo as to addreſs the public upon it, had it not been from the occaſion of an accident in that part of the country in which I reſide, viz. the fall of Newcaſtle and other bridges on the river Tyne on the <hi>17th</hi> of november <hi>1771,</hi> occaſioned by a high flood which roſe about <hi>9</hi> feet higher at Newcaſtle than the uſual ſpring tides do.—And this occaſion having furniſhed me with many opportunities of hearing and ſeeing very abſurd things advanced on the ſubject in general, I thought the demonſtrations of the relations of the eſſential parts of a bridge, would not be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to thoſe architects and others who may be capable of perceiving the force of them, and whoſe ignorance may not have prejudiced them againſt things which they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>4th</hi> ſection there is one thing forgotten to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, viz. That in determining the beſt form of the end of the pier to be a right-lined triangle, the water was ſuppoſed to ſtrike every part of it with the ſame velocity: had the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably increaſed velocity been uſed, the form of the ends would come out a little curved; but as the increaſe of the velocity in the beſt bridges is very ſmall, the difference in them is quite imperceptable.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION I.</hi> Of the Projects of Bridges, with the Deſign; Eſtimate, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>WHEN a bridge is deemed neceſſary to be built over a river, the firſt conſideration is the place of it; or what particular ſituation will contain a maximum of the advantages over the diſadvantages.</p>
               <p>In agitating this moſt important queſtion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very circumſtance, certain and probable, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or likely to attend the bridge, ſhould be ſeparately, minutely, and impartially ſtated and examined; and the advantage or diſadvantage of it rated at a value proportioned to it: then the difference between the whole advantages and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1182400700:5"/>diſadvantages, will be the neat value of that particular ſituation for which the calculation is made. And by doing the ſame for any other ſituations, all their neat values will be found, and of conſequence the moſt preferable ſituation among them.—Or, in a competition between two place, if each one's advantage over the other be eſtimated or valued in every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance attending them, the ſums of their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages will ſhew whether of them is the better. And the ſame being done for this and a third, and ſo on, the beſt ſituation of all will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>In this eſtimation, a great number of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars muſt be included; and nothing omitted that can be found to make a part of the conſideration.</p>
               <p>Among theſe, the ſituation of the town or place for the convenience of which the bridge is chiefly to be made, will naturally produce a particular of the firſt conſequence; and a great many others ought to be ſacrificed to it. If poſſible, the bridge ſhould be placed where there can conveniently be opened and made paſſages or ſtreets from the ends of it in every direction, and eſpecially one as nearly in the direction of the bridge itſelf as poſſible, tending towards the body of the town, without narrows or crooked windings, and eaſily communicating with the chief ſtreets, thoroughfares, &amp;c.—And here
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1182400700:6"/>every perſon, in judging of this, ſhould diveſt himſelf of all partial regards or attachments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; think and determine for the good of the whole only, and for poſterity as well as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>The banks or declivities towards the river are alſo of particular concern, as they affect the conveniency of the paſſage to and from the bridge, or determine the height of it, upon which in a great meaſure depends the expence.</p>
               <p>The breadth of the river, the navigation upon it, and the quantity of water to be paſſed, or the velocity and depth of the ſtream, from alſo conſiderations of great moment; as they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the bridge to be higher or lower, longer or ſhorter. However, in moſt caſes, a wide part of the river ought rather to be choſen than a narrow one, eſpecially if it is ſubject to great tides or floods; for, the increaſed velocity of the ſtream in the narrow part, being again aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the farther contraction of the breadth, by the piers of the bridge, will both incommode the navigation through the arches, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the piers and endanger the whole bridge.</p>
               <p>The nature of the bed of the river is alſo of great concern, it having a great influence on the expence; as upon it, and the depth and velocity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1182400700:7"/>of the ſtream, depend the manner of laying the foundations, and building the piers.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the chief and capital articles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and which will branch themſelves out into other dependent ones, and ſo lead to the required eſtimate of the whole.</p>
               <p>HAVING reſolved on the place, the next con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations are the form, the eſtimate of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and the manner of execution.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the form; ſtrength, utility, and beauty ought to be regarded and united; the chief part of which lies in the arches. The form of the arches will depend on their height and ſpan; and the height on that of the water, the navigation, and the adjacent banks. They ought to be made ſo high, as that they may eaſily tranſmit the water at its greateſt height either from tides or floods; and their height and figure ought alſo to be ſuch as will eaſily allow of a convenient paſſage of the craft through them. This and the diſpoſition of it above, ſo as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paſſage over it alſo convenient, make up its utility.—Having fixed the heights of the arches, their ſpans are ſtill neceſſary for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining their figure. Their ſpans will be known by dividing the whole breadth of the river into a convenient number of arches and piers, allowing at leaſt the neceſſary thickneſs of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1182400700:8"/>the piers out of the whole. In fixing on the number of arches, take always an odd number, and rather take few and large ones than many and ſmaller, if convenient: For thus you will have not only fewer foundations and piers to make, with fewer arches and centers, which will produce great ſavings in the expence, but the arches themſelves will alſo require much leſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials and workmanſhip, and allow of more and better paſſage for the water and craft through them; and will appear at the ſame time more noble and beautiful, eſpecially if conſtructed in elliptical, or in cycloidal forms: for the truth of which it may be ſufficient to refer to that noble and elegant bridge lately built at Blackfriars, London, by Mr. Mylne. And here I can't help remarking that the Gentleman who, a few years ſince in a pamphlet on the Principles of Bridges, cenſured Mr. Mylne and Mr. Muller concerning elliptic arches, has very much expoſed himſelf, and abſurdly criticiſes them through his own want of mathematical knowledge, which he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the ſame pamphlet affects to deſpiſe. He brings to my mind an expreſſion of (I think) Mr. Henry Fielding ſomewhere in his works, That a perſon does not ſpeak the worſe on a ſubject for knowing ſomething about it. I do not however make this remark through any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſreſpect for this Gentleman, concerning whom I know nothing farther, any more than I do about the other two Gentlemen, but only to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1182400700:9"/>prevent others from being prejudiced and miſled by the authority of his <hi>ipſe dixit.</hi>—If the top of the bridge be a ſtreight horizontal line, let the arches be made all of a ſize; if it be a little lower at the ends than the middle, the arches muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally decreaſe from the middle towards the ends; but if higher at the ends than the middle, let them increaſe towards the ends. A choice of the moſt convenient arches is to be made from the 4th and 5th propoſitions, where their ſeveral properties, &amp;c. are demonſtrated and pointed out; Among them, the elliptic, cycloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and equilibrial arch in prop. 5, will gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally claim the preference, both on account of their ſtrength, beauty, and cheapneſs or ſaving in materials and labour: Other particulars alſo concerning them may be ſeen under the word ARCH in the Dictionary in the laſt ſection, And as the choice of the arch is of ſo great moment, let no perſon, either through ignorance or indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, prefer a worſe arch becauſe it may ſeem to him eaſier to conſtruct; for he would very ill deſerve the name or employment of an Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, who is incapable of rendering the exact conſtruction of theſe curves eaſy and familiar to himſelf; but if, by chance, a Bridge-builder ſhould be employed who is incapable of doing that, he ought at leaſt to be endowed with ſuch a ſhare of honeſty as to procure ſome perſon to go through the calculations which he cannot make for himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1182400700:10"/>Next find what thickneſs at the keyſtone or top will be neceſſary for the arches. For which ſee the word KEYSTONE in the Dictionary in the laſt ſection.</p>
               <p>Having thus obtained all the parts of the arches, with the height of the piers, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary thickneſs of the piers themſelves are next to be computed by prop. 10.</p>
               <p>This done, the chief and material requiſites are found; the elevation and plans of the deſign can then be drawn, and the calculations of the expence form thence made, including the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, with ſuch ornamental or accidental ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages as ſhall be thought fit; which I ſhall leave to the diſcretion of the Practical Architect, as being no part of the plan of my undertaking, together with the practical methods of carrying the deſign into execution. I ſhall however, in the Dictionary in the laſt ſection, not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the terms, parts, machines, &amp;c. but alſo ſpeak of their dimenſions, properties, and any thing elſe material belonging to them; and to which therefore I from hence refer for more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit information in each particular article, as well as to theſe immediately following propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which the theory of the arches, piers, &amp;c. are fully and ſtrictly demonſtrated.</p>

                        </figure> however a ſtreight ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal line IK might be uſed inſtead of it, if the materials of which the arch is built, could
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1182400700:26"/>be ſo choſen, as that they might increaſe in their ſpecific gravity from DK towards CI, continually as the cube of the ſecant of the arch from D. And this again perhaps would be quite impracticable: But if a circular arch and a right line at the top were <hi>neceſſarily</hi> required, the proportion of DK to the radius DQ may be found ſo as the arch may be <hi>nearly</hi> in equilibrium thus:</p>
                     <p>When KI is a right line, then KR in the figure to the example, muſt be nothing; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when the curve croſſes the horizontal line, then KR is equal to nothing; put its value then, as found above, equal to o, and we ſhall have <gap reason="math">
                           <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and from this equation, by aſſuming one of the quantities, <hi>a, y,</hi> the correſponding value of the other may be found for the point where the curve croſſes the horizontal line; ſo from hence the general value of <hi>a</hi> is <gap reason="math">
                           <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Now this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of <hi>a</hi> or DK evidently becomes = 0 when the arch conſiſts of the whole ſemi-circle; but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1182400700:27"/>when the arch is leſs than the ſemicircle, <hi>a</hi> will have a finite value, and between 60 and 120 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees many arches of equilibration of a certain thickneſs at top may be found. Thus, if the half arch DC contain 30 degrees; then its ſine <hi>y</hi> or PC is = ½<hi>r;</hi> which being ſubſtituted for it in the above general value of <hi>a,</hi> we have <hi>a</hi> = 7√3−6/37 × 3\2 <hi>r,</hi> or = ¼<hi>r</hi> extremely near; that is, DK is = ¼ of DQ or ¼ of 2PC the ſpan when the curve cuts the horizontal line directly above the point in the circle which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to 30 degrees. And if DC were an arch of 45 degrees; then <hi>y</hi> = <hi>r</hi>√1/2, and <hi>a</hi> = 3√2−2/14 × <hi>r</hi> = 16<hi>r</hi>/100, or 1/9 of the ſpan nearly. Alſo, if DC were 60 degrees; then <hi>y</hi> = <hi>r</hi>√3/4, and <hi>a</hi> = 1/14th of <hi>r</hi> = 7<hi>r</hi>/100, or 1/16 of the ſpan nearly.— So that in each of theſe caſes the points C and D would be in equilibrium; but then about the middle parts between D and C, or rather nearer to D than to C, the materials ſhould be a little lighter than at D and C, and the exact propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which their gravity ſhould be diminiſhed, might eaſily be found by calculation; ſo in the firſt caſe, in particular, the ſpecific gravity of the materials in the middle of the arch between D and C, that is at 15 degrees from D, ſhould be to that at D or C, as 278 to 284, which is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1182400700:28"/>but a very inconſiderable decreaſe, and may be very well neglected.—In the firſt two caſes, the thickneſs at the top would be too much; but in the latter one, when the whole arch is 120 degrees, the thickneſs is juſt about that which the beſt architects now allow; and in greater arches the thickneſs would become too little. So that an arch of nearly about 120 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, is the only part of a circle that can be uſed with any degree of propriety.</p>

                     <p>Put <hi>a</hi> = DK, <hi>h</hi> = DQ = MN, <hi>c</hi> = AM, <hi>A</hi> = the area or ſection AIKD of the arch, <hi>d</hi> = AL = BG, <hi>e</hi> = FE, and <hi>x</hi> = AB = GL the required breadth of the pier.</p>
                     <p>Now (by prop. 63 <hi>Emer.</hi> Mechan.) the weight of the arch is to its preſſure in the direction AB, as NM is to MA; hence <hi>h</hi> ∶ <hi>c</hi> ∷ <hi>A</hi> ∶ <hi>cA</hi>/<hi>h</hi> = the force or ſhoot of the arch in the direction AB; which being drawn into the length of the lever BG = d, we have <hi>cdA</hi>/<hi>h</hi> for the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious force of the arch to overſet the pier, or to turn it about the point G.

                     <p>IN the inveſtigation of this propoſition, the ſections of the arch and pier are uſed for their ſolidities, as being evidently in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, or in that of their weights, ſince they are of the ſame length, viz. the breadth of the bridge.</p>
                     <p>By the above rules, together with thoſe in the four preceding propoſitions, the neceſſary thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a pier may be found, ſo that it ſhall <hi>juſt</hi> balance the ſpread or ſhoot of the arch, independent of any other arch on the other ſide of the pier. But the weight of the pier ought a little to preponderate againſt or exceed in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the ſhoot of the arch; and therefore the thickneſs ought to be taken a little more than what will be found by theſe rules; unleſs it be ſuppoſed that the pointed projections of the piers againſt the ſtream, beyond the common breadth of the bridge, will be a ſufficient addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the pier, to give it the neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderancy. —But there is one very material thing, on account of which the thickneſs of the piers may be much diminiſhed; viz. by the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1182400700:64"/>ſtones of the wall above the vouſſoirs being bonded in with thoſe of the pier and with one another, the pier will carry part of their weight; which will not only diminiſh the weight of the whole arch and wall, but will alſo both add the ſame to the weight of the pier, and lengthen the lever EG, by moving the center of gravity a little nearer to L; but then alſo M will be a little nearer to Q, ſo that AM will be longer, and the effects of the change of the centers of gravity may be ſuppoſed nearly to balance each other.—In the foregoing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions I have conſidered circular arches only, as it will make no difference of any conſequence, to ſuppoſe the arches of any other curve of the ſame ſpan and pitch. But this 10th prop. is general for all curves.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now add a few examples of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation in numbers, to ſhew the manner, and in them alſo to point out the eaſieſt methods of calculation.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION V.</hi> Of the Terms or Names of the various parts peculiar to a Bridge, and the Machines, &amp;c. uſed about it; diſpoſed in alphabetical order.</head>
               <p>ABUTMENT, or BUTMENT, which ſee in its place below.</p>
               <p>ARCH, and opening of a bridge, through or under which the water, &amp;c. paſſes, and which is ſupported by piers or by butments.</p>
               <p>Arches are denominated circular, elliptical, cycloidal, catenarian, &amp;c. according to the figure of the curve of them. There are alſo other denominations of circular arches according to the different parts of a circle: So, a ſemicircular arch is half the circle; a ſcheme or ſkeen arch is a ſegment leſs than the ſemicircle; and arches of the third and fourth point, or gothic arches, conſiſt of two circular arcs, excentric and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an angle at top, each being 1-3d or 1-4th, &amp;c. of the whole circle.</p>
               <p>The chief properties of the moſt conſiderable arches, with regard to the extrados they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, &amp;c. may be learned from the ſecond ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It there appears that none, but the arch
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1182400700:85"/>of equilibration in the example to prop. 5, can admit of a horizontal line at top; that this arch is not only of a graceful but of a convenient form, as it may be made higher or lower at pleaſure with the ſame opening; that it, but no other, with a horizontal top, can be equally ſtrong in all its parts, and therefore ought to be uſed in all works of much conſequence. All the other arches require tops that are curved either upward or downward, ſome more and ſome leſs: Of theſe the elliptical arch ſeems to be the fitteſt to be ſubſtituted inſtead of the equilibrial one with any tolerable degree of propriety; it is in general alſo the beſt form for moſt bridges, as it can be made of any height to the ſame ſpan, or of any ſpan to the ſame height, while at the ſame time its hanches are ſufficiently ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above the water, even when it is pretty flat at top; which is a property of which the other curves are not poſſeſſed in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and this property is the more valuable, becauſe it is remarked that after an arch is built and the centering ſtruck, it ſettles more about the hanches than the other parts, by which other curves are reduced near to a ſtreight line at the hanches. Elliptical arches alſo look bolder, are really ſtronger, and require leſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials and labour than the others. Of the other curves, the cycloidal arch is next in quality to the elliptical one, for all the above properties. And, laſtly, the circle. As to the others, the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1182400700:86"/>parabola, hyperbola, and catenary, they may not at all be admitted in bridges of ſeveral arches; but may in ſome caſes be uſed for a bridge of one ſingle arch which is to riſe very high, becauſe then not much loaded at the hanches. We may hence alſo perceive the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of thoſe arguments which aſſert, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the catenarian curve ſupports itſelf equally in all its parts, it will therefore beſt ſupport any additional weight laid upon it: for the additional building made to raiſe the bridge to a horizontal line, or nearly ſuch, by preſſing more in one part than another, muſt force thoſe parts down, and the whole muſt fall. Whereas other curves will not ſupport themſelves at all without ſome additional parts built above them, to balance them, or to reduce their parts to an equilibrium.</p>
               <p>ARCHIVOLT, the curve or line formed by the upper ſides of the vouſſoirs or arch ſtones. It is parallel to the intrados or underſide of the arch when the vouſſoirs are all of the ſame length; otherwiſe not.</p>
               <p>By the archivolt is alſo ſometimes underſtood the whole ſet of vouſſoirs.</p>
               <p>BANQUET, the raiſed foot path at the ſides of the bridge next the parapet. This ought to be allowed in all bridges of any conſiderable
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1182400700:87"/>ſize: it ſhould be raiſed about a foot above the middle or horſe paſſage, made 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, &amp;c. feet broad according to the ſize of the bridge, and paved with large ſtones whoſe length is equal to the breadth of the walk.</p>
               <p>BATTARDEAU, or <hi>Coffer-dam,</hi> a caſe of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp;c. without a bottom, fixed in the bed of the river, water-tight or nearly ſo, by which to lay the bottom dry for a ſpace large enough to build the pier on. When it is fixed, its ſides reaching above the level of the water, the water is pumped out of it, or drawn off by engines, &amp;c. till the ſpace be dry; and it is kept ſo by the ſame means, if there are leaks which cannot be ſtopped, till the pier is built up in it; and then the materials of it are drawn up again.</p>
               <p>Battardeaux are made in various manners, either by a ſingle incloſure, or by a double one, with clay or chalk rammed in between the two, to prevent the water from coming through the ſides. And theſe incloſures are alſo made either with piles only, driven cloſe by one another, and ſometimes notched or dove-tailed into each other; or with piles grooved in the ſides, driven in at a diſtance from one another, and boards let down between them in the grooves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1182400700:88"/>The method of building in battardeaux can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be uſed where the river is either deep or rapid. It alſo requires a very good natural bottom of ſolid earth or clay; for, although the ſides be made water-tight, if the bottom or bed of the river be of a looſe conſiſtence, the water will ooze up through it in too great abundance to be evacuated by the engines.</p>
               <p>It is almoſt needleſs to remark that the ſides muſt be made very ſtrong, and well propt or braced in the inſide, to prevent the ambient water from preſſing the ſides in, and forcing its way into the battardeau.</p>
               <p>BRIDGE, a work of carpentry or maſonry, built over a river, canal, &amp;c. for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of croſſing the ſame.</p>
               <p>A ſtone bridge is an edifice forming a way over a river, &amp;c. ſupported by one arch or by ſeveral arches, and theſe again ſupported by proper piers or butments.</p>
               <p>A ſtately bridge over a large river is one of the moſt noble and ſtriking pieces of art. To behold huge and bold arches, compoſed of an immenſe quantity of ſmall materials, as ſtones, bricks, &amp;c. ſo diſpoſed and united together that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1182400700:89"/>they ſeem to form but one ſolid compact body, affording a ſafe paſſage for men and carriages over large waters, which with their navigation paſs free and eaſy under them at the ſame time, is a ſight truly ſurprizing and affecting indeed.</p>
               <p>To the abſolutely neceſſary parts of a bridge already mentioned, viz. the arches, piers, and abutments, may be added the paving at top, the parapet wall, either with or without a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrade, &amp;c. alſo the banquet or raiſed foot way on each ſide, leaving a ſufficient breadth in the middle for horſes and carriages. The breadth of a bridge for a great city ſhould be ſuch as to allow an eaſy paſſage for three carriages and two horſemen a-breaſt in the middle way, and for three foot paſſengers in the ſame manner on each banquet. And for other leſs bridges a leſs breadth.</p>
               <p>As a bridge is made for a way or paſſage over a river, &amp;c. ſo it ought to be made of ſuch a height as will be quite convenient for that paſſage; but yet ſo as to be conſiſtent with the intereſt and concerns of the river itſelf, eaſily admitting through its arches the craft that navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate upon it, and all the water even at high tides and floods. The neglect of this precept has been the ruin of many bridges, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that at Newcaſtle, over the river Tyne, on the 17th of november 1771. So that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1182400700:90"/>its height, the conveniencies both of the paſſage over it and under it ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and the height made to anſwer the beſt for them both, obſerving to make the <hi>convenient</hi> give place to the <hi>neceſſary</hi> when their intereſts are oppoſite.</p>
               <p>Bridges are generally placed in a direction perpendicular to the ſtream in a direct line, to give free paſſage to the water, &amp;c. But ſome think they ſhould be made not in a ſtreight line, but convex towards the ſtream, the better to reſiſt floods, &amp;c. And ſome ſuch bridges have been made.</p>
               <p>Again, a bridge ſhould not be made in too narrow a part of a navigable river, or one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to tides or floods: becauſe the breadth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill more contracted by the piers, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the depth, velocity, and fall of the water under the arches, and endanger the whole bridge and navigation.</p>
               <p>The number of arches of a bridge are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally made odd; either that the middle of the ſtream or chief current may flow freely without the interruption of a pier; or that the two halves of the bridge, by gradually riſing from the ends to the middle, may there meet in the higheſt and largeſt arch; or elſe, for the ſake of grace, that by being open in the middle, the eye in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1182400700:91"/>viewing it may look directly through there, as one always expects to do in looking at it, and without which opening one generally feels a diſappointment in viewing it.</p>
               <p>If the bridge be equally high throughout, the arches, being all of a height, are made all of a ſize; which cauſes a great ſaving of centering. If the bridge be higher in the middle than at the ends, let the arches decreaſe from the middle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each end, but ſo as that each half have the arches exactly alike, and that they decreaſe in ſpan, proportionally to their height, ſo as to be always the ſame kind of figure, and ſimilar parts of that figure: thus, if one be a ſemicircle, let the reſt be ſemicircles alſo, but proportionally leſs; if one be a ſegment of a circle, let the reſt be ſimilar ſegments of other circles; and ſo for other figures. The arches being equal at equal diſtances on both ſides of the middle, is not only for the ſtrength and beauty of the bridge, but that the centering of the one half may ſerve for the other alſo. But if the bridge be higher at the ends than in the middle, the arches ought to increaſe in ſpan and pitch from the middle towards the ends.</p>
               <p>When the middle and ends are of different heights, their difference however ought not to be great in proportion to the length, that the aſcent may be eaſy; and then alſo it is more
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1182400700:92"/>beautiful to make the top one continued curve than two inclined ſtreight lines from the ends towards the middle.</p>
               <p>Bridges ſhould rather be of few and large arches than of many and ſmall ones, if the height and ſituation will poſſibly allow of it; for this will leave more free paſſage for the water and navigation, and be a great ſaving in materials and labour, as there will be fewer piers and centers, and the arches themſelves will require leſs materials.</p>
               <p>For the fabric of a bridge, and the proper eſtimation of the expence, &amp;c. there are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally neceſſary three plans, three ſections, and an elevation. The three plans are ſo many horizontal ſections, viz. the firſt a plan of the foundation under the piers, with the particular circumſtances attending it, whether of gratings, planks, piles, &amp;c. the ſecond is the plan of the piers and arches, &amp;c. and the third is the plan of the ſuperſtructure, with the paved road and banquet. The three ſections are vertical ones; the firſt of them a longitudinal ſection from end to end and through the middle of the breadth; the ſecond a tranſverſe one, or acroſs it, and through the ſummit of an arch; and the third alſo acroſs, and taken upon a pier. The eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an orthographic projection of one ſide or face of the bridge, or its appearance as viewed
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1182400700:93"/>at an infinite diſtance, and ſhews the exterior aſpect of the materials, and the manner in which they are worked and decorated.</p>
               <p>Other obſervations are to be ſeen in the firſt ſection.</p>
               <p>BUTMENTS, or <hi>abutments,</hi> the extremities of a bridge, by which it joins to or abuts upon the land or ſides of the river, &amp;c. Theſe muſt be made very ſecure, quite immovable, and more than barely ſufficient to reſiſt the drift of its adjacent arch. So that if there are not rocks or very ſolid banks to raiſe them againſt, they muſt be well reinforced with proper walls or returns, &amp;c. The thickneſs of them that will be barely ſufficient to reſiſt the ſhoot of the arch, may be calculated as that of a pier by prop. 10.</p>
               <p>When the foundation of a butment is raiſed againſt a ſloping bank of rock, gravel, or good ſolid earth, it will produce a ſaving of materials and labour, to carry the work on by returns at different heights, like ſteps of ſtairs.</p>
               <p>CAISSON, a kind of <hi>cheſt,</hi> or flat-bottomed boat, in which a pier is built, then ſunk to the bed of the river, and the ſides looſened and taken off from the bottom, by a contrivance for that purpoſe; the bottom of it being left
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1182400700:94"/>under the pier as a foundation. It is evident therefore that the bottoms of caiſſons muſt be made very ſtrong and fit for the foundations of the piers. The caiſſon is kept a-float till the pier be built to about the height of low-water mark; and for that purpoſe its ſides muſt either be made of more than that height at firſt, or elſe gradually raiſed to it as it ſinks by the weight of the work, ſo as always to keep its top above water. And therefore the ſides muſt be made very ſtrong, and kept aſunder by croſs timbers within, leſt the great preſſure of the ambient water cruſh the ſides in, and ſo not only endanger the work, but alſo drown the men who work within it. The caiſſon is made of the ſhape of the pier, but ſome feet wider on every ſide to make room for the men to work: the whole of the ſides are of two pieces, both joined to the bottom quite around, and to each other at the ſalient angle, ſo as to be diſengaged from the bottom and from each other when the pier is raiſed to the deſired height, and ſunk. It is alſo convenient to have a little ſluice made in the bottom, occaſionally to open and ſhut, to ſink the caiſſon and pier ſometimes by, before it be finiſhed, to try if it bottom level and rightly; for by opening the ſluice, the water will ruſh in and fill it to the height of the exterior water, and the weight of the work already built will ſink it; then by ſhutting the ſluice again, and pumping out the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1182400700:95"/>water, it will be made to float again, and the reſt of the work may be completed: but it muſt not be ſunk but when the ſides are high enough to reach above the ſurface of the water, otherwiſe it cannot be raiſed and laid dry again. Mr. Labelye tells us that the caiſſons in which he built ſome of the piers of Weſtminſter bridge, contained above 150 load of fir timber of 40 cubic feet each, and was of more tonnage or capacity than a 40 gun ſhip of war.</p>
               <p>CENTERS, are the timber frames erected in the ſpaces of the arches to turn them on, by building on them the vouſſoirs of the arch. As the center ſerves as a foundation for the arch to be built on, when the arch is completed, that foundation is ſtruck from under it, to make way for the water and navigation, and then the arch will ſtand of itſelf from its curved fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. A center muſt therefore be conſtructed of the exact figure of the intended arch, convex as the arch is concave, to receive it on as a mould. If the form be circular, the curve is ſtruck from a central point by a radius: if it be elliptical, it ought to be ſtruck with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled cord, paſſing over two pins or nails fixed in the focuſſes, as the mathematicians deſcribe their ellipſes; and not by ſtriking different pieces or arcs of circles from ſeveral centers; for theſe will form no ellipſe at all, but an irregular miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen curve made up of broken pieces of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1182400700:96"/>circular arcs: but if the arch be of any other form, the ſeveral abſciſſas and ordinates ought to be calculated, then their correſponding lengths, transferred to the centering, will give ſo many points of the curve, and exactly by which points bending a bow of pliable matter, the curve may be drawn by it.</p>
               <p>The centers are conſtructed of beams, &amp;c. of timber firmly pinned and bound together, into one entire compact frame, covered ſmooth at top with planks or boards to place the vouſſoirs on, the whole ſupported by offsets in the ſides of the piers, and by piles driven into the bed of the river, and capable of being raiſed and depreſſed by wedges, contrived for that purpoſe, and for taking them down when the arch is completed. They ought alſo to be conſtructed of a ſtrength more than ſufficient to bear the weight of the arch.</p>
               <p>In taking the center down; firſt let it down a little, all in a piece, by eaſing ſome of the wedges; there let it reſt a few hours or days to try if the arch make any efforts to fall, or any joints open, or ſtones cruſh or crack, &amp;c. that the damage may be repaired before the center is entirely removed, which is not to be done till the arch ceaſes to make any viſible efforts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:1182400700:97"/>In ſome bridges the centering makes a very conſiderable part of the expence, and therefore all means of ſaving in this article ought to be cloſely attended to; ſuch as making few arches, and as nearly alike or ſimilar as poſſible, that the centering of one arch may ſerve for others, and at leaſt that the ſame center may be uſed for both of each pair of equal arches on both ſides of the middle.</p>
               <p>CHEST, the ſame as <hi>Caiſſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>COFFERDAM, the ſame as <hi>Battardeau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DRIFT, <hi>Shoot,</hi> or <hi>Thruſt</hi> of an arch, is the puſh or force which it exerts in the direction of the length of the bridge. This force ariſes from the perpendicular gravitation of the ſtones of the arch, which, being kept from deſcending by the form of the arch and the reſiſtance of the pier, exert their force in a lateral or hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal direction. This force is computed in prop. 10, where the thickneſs of the pier is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that is neceſſary to reſiſt it; and is greater the lower the arch is, <hi>coeteris paribus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ELEVATION, the orthographic projection of the front of a bridge on the vertical plane pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to its length. This is neceſſary to ſhew the form and dimenſions of the arches and other
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1182400700:98"/>parts as to height and breadth, and therefore has a plain ſcale annexed to it to meaſure the parts by. It alſo ſhews the manner of working up and decorating the fronts of the bridge.</p>
               <p>EXTRADOS, the exterior curvature or line of an arch. In the propoſitions of the ſecond ſection it is the outer or upper line of the wall above the arch; but it often means only the upper or exterior curve of the vouſſoirs.</p>
               <p>FOUNDATIONS, the bottoms of the piers, &amp;c. or the baſes on which they are built. Theſe bottoms are always to be made with projections, greater or leſs according to the ſpaces on which they are built. And according to the nature of the ground, depth and velocity of water, &amp;c. the foundations are laid and the piers built after different manners, either in caiſſons, in battar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux, on ſtilts with ſterlings, &amp;c. for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular methods of doing which, ſee each under its reſpective term.</p>
               <p>The moſt obvious and ſimple method of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foundations and raiſing the piers up to water-mark, is to turn the river out of its courſe above the place of the bridge, into a new channel cut for it near the place where it makes an elbow or turn; then the piers are built on dry ground, and the water turned into its old courſe again, the new one being ſecurely banked
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1182400700:99"/>up. This is certainly the beſt method, when the new channel can be eaſily and conveniently made; but which however is ſeldom or never the caſe.</p>
               <p>Another method is to lay only the ſpace of each pier dry till it be built, by ſurrounding it with piles and planks driven down into the bed of the river, ſo cloſe together as to exclude the water from coming in; then the water is pumped out of the incloſed ſpace, the pier built in it, and laſtly the piles and planks drawn up. This is coffer-dam work, but evidently cannot be practiſed if the bottom be of a looſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence admitting the water to ooze and ſpring up through it.</p>
               <p>When neither the whole nor part of the river can be eaſily laid dry as above, other methods are to be uſed; ſuch as to build either in caiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or on ſtilts, both which methods are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed under their proper words; or yet by another method, which hath, though ſeldom, been ſometimes uſed, without laying the bottom dry, and which is thus: the pier is built upon ſtrong rafts or gratings of timber well bound together, and buoyed up on the ſurface of the water by ſtrong cables, fixed to other flotes or machines, till the pier is built; the whole is then gently let down to the bottom, which muſt be made level for the purpoſe. But of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1182400700:100"/>theſe methods, that of building in caiſſons is the beſt.</p>
               <p>But before the pier can be built in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the ground at the bottom muſt be well ſecured, and made quite good and ſafe if it be not ſo naturally. The ſpace muſt be bored into to try the conſiſtence of the ground; and if a good bottom of ſtone, or firm gravel, clay, &amp;c. be met with within a moderate depth below the bed of the river, the looſe ſand, &amp;c. muſt be removed and digged out to it, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation laid on the firm bottom on a ſtrong gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or baſe of timber made much broader every way than the pier, that there may be the greater baſe to preſs on, to prevent its being ſunk. But if a ſolid bottom cannot be found at a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient depth to dig to, the ſpace muſt then be driven full of ſtrong piles, whoſe tops muſt be ſawed off level ſome feet below the bed of the water, the ſand having been previouſly digged out for that purpoſe; and then the foundation on a grating of timber laid on their tops as before. Or, when the bottom is not good, if it be made level, and a ſtrong grating of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, two, three, or four times as large as the baſe of the pier be made, it will form a good baſe to bulid on, its great ſize preventing it from ſinking. In driving the piles, begin at the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and proceed outwards all the way to the borders or margin: the reaſon of which is, that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1182400700:101"/>if the outer ones were driven firſt, the earth of the inner ſpace would be thereby ſo jammed together, as not to allow the inner piles to be driven. And beſides the piles immediately under the piers, it is alſo very prudent to drive in a ſingle, double, or triple row of them around and cloſe to the frame of the foundation, cutting them off a little above it, to ſecure it from ſlipping aſide out of its place, and to bind the ground under the pier the firmer. For, as the ſafety of the whole bridge depends on the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, too much care cannot be uſed to have the bottom made quite ſecure.</p>

               <p>IMPOST, is the part of the pier on which the feet of the arches ſtand, or from which whey ſpring.</p>
               <p>KEYSTONE, the middle vouſſoir, or the arch ſtone in the top or immediately over the center of the arch. The length of the keyſtone, or thickneſs of the archivolt at top, is allowed to be about 1-15th or 1-16th of the ſpan, by the beſt architects.</p>

                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:1182400700:102"/>PARAPET, the breaſt wall made on the top of a bridge to prevent paſſengers from falling over. In good bridges, to build the parapet but a little part of its height cloſe or ſolid, and upon that a baluſtrade to above a man's height, has an elegant effect.</p>
               <p>PIERS, the walls built for the ſupport of the arches, and from which they ſpring as their baſes.</p>
               <p>They ought to be built of large blocks of ſtone, ſolid throughout, and cramped together with iron, which will make the whole as one ſolid ſtone. Their faces or ends, from the baſe up to high-water mark, ought to project ſharp out with a ſalient angle, to divide the ſtream. Or, perhaps, the bottom of the pier ſhould be built flat or ſquare up to about half the height of low-water mark, to allow a lodgment againſt it for the ſand and mud, to cover the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; leſt, by being left bare, the water ſhould in time undermine and ſo ruin or injure it. The beſt form of the projection for dividing the ſtream, is the triangle; and the longer it is, or the more acute the ſalient angle, the better it will divide it, and the leſs will the force of the water be againſt the pier; but it may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make that angle a right one, as it will make the work ſtronger, and in that caſe the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1182400700:103"/>perpendicular projection will be equal to half the breadth or thickneſs of the pier. In rivers on which large heavy craft navigate and paſs the arches, it may perhaps be better to make the ends ſemicircular; for although it does not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the water ſo well as the triangle, it will both better turn off and bear the ſhock of the craft.</p>
               <p>The thickneſs of the piers ought to be ſuch as will make them of weight or ſtrength ſufficient to ſupport their interjacent arch independent of any other arches. And then if the middle of the pier be run up to its full height, the centering may be ſtruck to be uſed in another arch before the hanches are filled up. The whole theory of the piers may be ſeen in the third ſection.</p>
               <p>They ought to be made with a broad bottom on the foundation, and gradually diminiſhed in thickneſs by offsets up to low-water mark.</p>
               <p>The methods of laying their foundations, and building them up to the ſurface of the water, are given under the word FOUNDATION.</p>
               <p>PILES, are timbers driven into the bed of the river for various purpoſes, and are either round, ſquare, or flat like planks. They may be of any wood which will not rot under water, but oak and fir are moſtly uſed, eſpecially the latter, on account of its length, ſtreightneſs, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1182400700:104"/>cheapneſs. They are ſhod with a pointed iron at the bottom, the better to penetrate into the ground; and are bound with a ſtrong iron band or ring at top, to prevent them from being ſplit by the violent ſtrokes of the ram by which they are driven down.</p>
               <p>Piles are either uſed to build the foundations on, or are driven about the pier as a border of defence, or to ſupport the centers on; and in this caſe, when the centering is removed, they muſt either be drawn up or ſawed off very low under water; but it is perhaps better to ſaw them off and leave them ſticking in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, leſt the drawing of them out ſhould looſen the ground about the foundation of the pier. Thoſe to build on, are either ſuch as are cut off by the bottom of the water, or rather a few feet within the bed of the river; or elſe ſuch as are cut off at low-water mark, and then they are called ſtilts. Thoſe to form borders of defence, are rows driven in cloſe by the frame of a foundation, to keep it firm; or elſe they are to form a caſe or jettee about ſtilts, to keep within it the ſtones that are thrown in to fill it up; in this caſe, the piles are grooved, driven at a little diſtance from each other, and plank piles let into the grooves between them, and driven down alſo, till the whole ſpace is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded. Beſides uſing this for ſtilts, it is alſo ſometimes neceſſary to ſurround a ſtone pier
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1182400700:105"/>with a ſterling or jettee, and fill it up with ſtones to ſecure an injured pier from being ſtill more damaged, and the whole bridge ruined. The piles to ſupport the centers may alſo ſerve as a border of piling to ſecure the foundation, cutting them off low enough after the center is removed.</p>
               <p>PILE DRIVER, and engine for driving down the piles. It conſiſts of a large ram of iron ſliding perpendicularly down between two guide poſts; which being lift up to the top of them, and there let fall from a great height, comes down upon the top of the pile with a violent blow. It is worked either with men or horſes, and either with or without wheel-work. That which was uſed at the building of Weſtminſter bridge, is perhaps the beſt ever invented.</p>
               <p>PITCH, of an arch, the perpendicular height from the ſpring or impoſt to the keyſtone.</p>
               <p>PLAN, of any part, as of the foundations, or piers, or ſuperſtructure, is the orthographic projection of it on a plane paralled to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</p>

The right-lined angle beſt divides the ſtream, and the more acute the better for that purpoſe; but the right angle is generally uſed as making the beſt maſonry. A ſemicircular end, though it does not divide the ſtream ſo well, is ſometimes better in large navigable rivers, as it carries the craft the better off, or bears their ſhocks the better.</p>

               <p>STILTS, a ſet of piles driven into the ſpace intended for the pier, whoſe tops being ſawed level of about low-water mark, the pier is then raiſed on them. This method was formerly uſed when the bottom of the river could not be laid dry; and theſe ſtilts were ſurrounded, at a few feet diſtance, by a row of piles and planks, &amp;c. cloſe to them like a coffer-dam, and called a ſterling or jettee; after which looſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1182400700:107"/>ſtones, &amp;c. are thrown or poured down into the ſpace till it be filled up to the top, by that means forming a kind of pier of rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or looſe work, and which is kept together by the ſides or ſterlings: this is then paved level at the top, and the arches turned upon it. This method was formerly much uſed, moſt of the large old bridges in England being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected that way, ſuch as London bridge, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle bridge, Rocheſter bridge, &amp;c. But the inconveniencies attending it are ſo great, that it is now quite exploded and diſuſed: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the looſe compoſition of the piers, they muſt be made very large or broad, or elſe the arch would puſh them over and ruſh down as ſoon as the center was drawn; which great breadth of piers and ſterlings ſo much contracts the paſſage of the water, as not only very much incommodes the navigation through the arch, from the fall and quick motion of the water, but from the ſame cauſe alſo the bridge itſelf is in much danger, eſpecially in time of floods, when the water is too much for the paſſage. Add to this that beſides the danger there is of the pier burſting out the ſterlings, they are alſo ſubject to much decay and damage by the velocity of the water and the craft paſſing through the arches.</p>
