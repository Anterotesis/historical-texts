            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is neither to Anſwer the Clamours of thoſe, who Rail

or Nation in that part of <hi>Britain,</hi> againſt the Out-Cries
and Complaints of the Epiſcopal Party, that
this Tract is at this time made publick.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe deſerves no Anſwer, being Noiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

ſuch Furious Inconſiſtent Eſcapes generally do, die with
Time. The ſecond needs no Anſwer, that Party being fully
Anſwer'd, and fairly Silenced already, partly by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of their own Conſciences, and compleatly by the late
Reverend and Worthy Doctor <hi>Rule</hi> Principal of the College

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Epiſcopal Clergy.</p>
            <p>But this Deſign ſeems to me equally neceſſary, both to the
Proteſtant Intereſt in this Iſland, and to the general Peace
which every good Man wiſhes and hopes for among us, and
which, by the late happy Union, ſeems nearer in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to us: And in order to which, I thought it a very
uſeful piece of Work, to ſtate the Matter of Fact between the
Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> and the Diſſenters there, and enquire
into ſome things, in which the World has been not a little
impoſed upon.</p>
            <p>I do confeſs, when I came firſt into <hi>Scotland,</hi> I was in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more ſurprized, than in the Matter of the Diſſenters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

in <hi>Scotland</hi> were intirely depoſed and ſuppreſt, perſecuted,
and not permitted to keep up any Form of a Separation in
Religious Matters.</p>
            <p>And I think my ſelf oblig'd to enter into this Caſe, not
only to do the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> Juſtice, and defend her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her Enemies, but to defend her againſt her Friends:
If a Rake or a Scoundrel ill-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>reat me, I think it not worth
my notice, 'tis below my Concern, he does it becauſe he is a
Rake and a Scoundrel, and the Slander goes but a little way;
But if a Man of Virtue, a Man of Senſe, a Man of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if a good man cenſures me; I am concerned at it on a
Twofold Account, 1. Becauſe his Miſtake will Wound me

Becauſe I am willing to undeceive him, and prevent his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing

Friendſhip to him, to prevent his Bluſhes.</p>
            <p>That the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> has carryed it with great Heat,
and rigid Severity (to put it now in the ſofteſt Terms I can)
towards the Epiſcopal Clergy Diſſenting from them, and

pretended to had Truth enough in them to merit real Blame,
and that the Warmth of Northern Zeal had carryed the <hi>Scots</hi>
beyond that Moderation, which is the Beauty and Glory of
the Proteſtant Religion, and which I doubt not to make

and perhaps they may here find ſome Occaſion to alter
their Meaſures, and, with reſpect to their own Reputation,
change their Note; For it always weakens the Reputation of

            <p>When therefore theſe Sheets are a little read and conſidered
in the World, I make no Queſtion, but ſeveral ſorts of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0021300300:5"/>
People may find Occaſion to Bluſh: And <hi>I</hi> cannot have ſo
little Charity, as not to hope they will ſuffer the Convictions
of Truth in Fact, ſo far to prevail upon their Reaſon and
Temper, as to cauſe them to deteſt the Practices of thoſe, who
having not been able, by any legal fair Proceedings, to charge
the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> with any thing unbecoming her, as a
Chriſtian, a National, or a Proteſtant Church, have thought
to ſupply that Defect with the Aſſiſtance of moſt abominable
Slanders, depending upon the Diſtance of Place and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Circumſtances, as Difficulties which would obſtruct
the Diſcovery, and at leaſt concluding, it would ſerve a Turn
for a Time, delude the Ignorant and Uninquiring Part of
the World, and in general, help to make the Reformation
and Eſtabliſhment in <hi>Scotland</hi> odious and contemptible; and
thereby fix a Prejudice in the People of this Iſland one againſt
another, a Temper they had ſo often Occaſion to make uſe
of, and was ſo conſtantly ſubſervient to their Miſchievous
Deſigns, that they could not fail always to reap ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by it; Bad is that Cauſe, that flouriſhes only in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Confuſion, and that is always beſt propagated by Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
and Diſſention.</p>
            <p>Nor could the Promoters of theſe things find a better
Handle in the World to take hold of, in order to defame and
render contemptible the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterians, than the Charge
of Cruelty and Perſecution—. Perſecution is a Word par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
hateful among Proteſtants, as what every Proteſtant
Church in the World has, firſt or laſt, been ſuffering under,
and the Churches of this Iſland in eſpecial manner.—</p>
            <p>When therefore they had gotten hold, as they thought, of
this Matter, they ſeem'd fully ſatisfied, that they had the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
not of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> only, but of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
and Diſſenters in general, under Foot—. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To
prove the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> were of perſecuting Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
Cruel and Tyrannical, was the ready way to ruine all
the Proſpects of joyning Intereſts in <hi>England</hi> between them
and the Moderate Church Men, <hi>a thing the High Party foreſaw
was coming forward, and which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

could furniſh them with a more plauſible ground of Suggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this upon the Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> than firſt to charge

of late to ſpeak of <hi>Scotland</hi> more than uſual; this has taken
too much root among even the Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> and
theſe of them who have been the beſt Friends to <hi>Scotland,</hi> that
they have been made to believe, there has been at leaſt too
much Truth in the General Charge, and that really the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Party have been perſecuted and ſeverely treated.</p>
            <p>Nothing has been more common, than, in talking of theſe
things, to have the Honeſt People ſpeak with concern about
it, and bring it out with an, <hi>I wiſh the</hi> Scots <hi>would uſe the

and return, <hi>I am afraid there is ſome Truth in it:</hi> And to this day,
<hi>I</hi> believe <hi>I</hi> may ſpeak it without any Heſitation, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

that the Presbyterian Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> to really cruſh, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,

            <p>And indeed, if we conſider the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tile of the ſeveral Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets

how poſitively they have aſſerted things; their ſtrange, yet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0021300300:7"/>
frequent deſcending to particulars, which nevertheleſs were
falſe in Fact, and how ſtrangely they have impoſed upon the
World—And withal, that not any Man, in <hi>England</hi> at
leaſt, has ever formally taken up this Cauſe, it is no wonder,
that both Friend and Enemy have received Impreſſions, to the
prejudice of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and have taken up an
Opinion of the Truth of theſe things, as moſt certain, and
not to be denyed.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>I</hi> enter into the Matter of Fact, as it now ſtands in
<hi>Scotland, I</hi> think it is very proper to quote a few of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
which the People, of whom <hi>I</hi> have been ſpeaking,
charge upon the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which they call
Perſecution, which, firſt of all, cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e called Perſecution,
if true: And, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> If they were to be called Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
can, by no means, be lay'd to the Charge of the Church.</p>
            <p>As, <hi>firſt,</hi> the Violences of the common People upon the
Revolution.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> The Depoſing the Miniſters.</p>
            <p>As to the Violences of the Mob, <hi>I</hi> would, by no means,
have <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men call that Perſecution, becauſe the Rabbles,
in the Affair of the Revolution, were equally Violent in
<hi>England,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Church of <hi>England</hi> Rabble and Presbyterian Rabble, none
of which can be accuſed by one another, nor were ever, that
<hi>I</hi> remember, juſtifyed by either—But no Church Man
ought to Exclaim againſt a Presbyterian Rabble, leſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
double it upon him, with a Hiſtory of the Church
Rabbles upon them, and they ſhould be diſtinguiſh'd by this
unhappy Circumſtance, that, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Rabbles uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Violence with thoſe, who had Murther'd their Fathers,
Mothers, and near Relations, who had dipped their Hands
in Blood, and had prompted and appear'd in the greateſt
Barbarities, that any Age or Nation can parallel, and had
thereby provoked them to the higheſt Degree; Whereas, in
<hi>England,</hi> the Rabbles rifled, plundered, and inſulted the
Houſes, Parks, and Lands of peaceable Gentlemen, who had

have expected.</p>
            <p>Let all the Exceſſes of the Multitude therefore ly buried
under the ſame Charity, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that covers your former
Barbarous Treatment: And if they did not Piſtol in cold
Blood; If they did not Ty the Women to Stakes in the Sea,
and let the Tide Flow over them; If they did not Drag you
out of your Houſes, and Shoot you, without giving you Time
to Commend your Souls to GOD's Mercy; If theſe Things
were not done, you ought to believe, none of the Poſterity
of theſe poor Innocents, that ſo Suffered, were Alive to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
them; or that you had more Mercy from their Hands,
than you had Reaſon to expect.</p>
            <p>Theſe things therefore cannot be called Perſecution, and
the Violences of the Rabbles of the Revolution ſhould be
raz'd out of the Catalogue—. An <hi>Engliſh</hi> High-Church-Man

ſhould not, becauſe of the juſt Provocation his Party
had given the Poor People to Treat them more Violently.</p>
            <p>Again, if, by nice Diſtinctions, they ſhould chance to
ſay, they have proved this to be Perſecution—. What's
this to the Church? It might be done by Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians

<hi>THE PRESBYTERIANS as a Church:</hi> It was done by no Act
of the Church, no, nor of the Government; nor did either the

any of the Perſons—. 'Tis true, there was no publick
puniſhing the Actors; neither did the Government in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
puniſh, neither was it a time to puniſh thoſe Exceſſes:
And particularly the Government in <hi>England</hi> thought fit, by
Parliament, ſo far to bear with them, as to ſtop all Proceſs

            </p>
            <p>There is alſo another unhappy Circumſtance, that ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

clears the Church of this Charge, that I cannot
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0021300300:9"/>
but wonder, the Party could ever make uſe of it as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
or bring this Matter of Rabbling into the Charge:
And that is, That theſe Tumults, Plunderings, and Driving
away the Epiſcopal Miniſters, were all done and over,
before there was any ſuch thing as a Presbyterian Church, I
mean, eſtabliſh'd, or in any Power to Act as a Judicatory,
or as a Body; So that, to charge the Church with this, is
like Indicting a Man for a Murder committed before he was
born.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore take up none of my time here, to Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> from any part of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what can, with no colour of Reaſon, put the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection

the Name of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Depoſing the Miniſters</hi>—. This I think will hardly
come under the Name of Perſecution, nor take up much of my
time—. What little I ſhall ſay, will be perfectly new to
what has been ſaid before, <hi>viz.</hi> If this Debate be entered
upon, it will ſeem to me to depend upon the Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the Reformation,
and ſo it will only remain to inquire, whether Epiſcopacy
in <hi>Scotland</hi> was not an Uſurpation, and a Perſecution upon
the Rightful Eſtabliſhment: And the Depoſing it only a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
the Presbyterian Church to its proper undoubted poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion:
And this being a <hi>Point remote to my preſent Debate,</hi>
I wave it here, not but that I ſhall readily enter upon that
Queſtion too, as Occaſion may preſent, or when ever thoſe
complaining Gentlemen pleaſe to require it.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I think it is not ſo much the Depoſing the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
or E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lergy ſubſequent to it—. And that brings me
directly to Matter of Fact.—</p>
            <p>In purſuing which, I ſhall not ſo much deſcend to the
particular Stories Affirmed in Print, the Falſhood of moſt
of which are evidently detected by Doctor <hi>Rule,</hi> as aforeſaid:
And in ſpeaking to which, I muſt be obliged to blacken a

Nor would it be to the purpoſe here, to trouble the Reader
with proving of <hi>Negatives,</hi> and Detecting the particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in the Method I have now choſen, and muſt require
farther Documents or Vouchers to confirm them, than the
Authorities which yet have been produced.</p>
            <p>My Method therefore ſhall be, to give an Impartial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the general Proceedings of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
in the Matter of Eſtabliſhing the Presbyterian Diſcipline, and
Depoſing Epiſcopacy, together with their Behaviour to the
Epiſcopal Clergy, thro' the whole Courſe of the preſent Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment;
And tho the whole can be but an Abſtract or
Abridgment, I mean as to Caſes; yet I make no doubt, it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> fully, and to all Impartial Obſervers of things, intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vindicate the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> from all the Aſperſions
of her Enemies; and prove, that the Circumſtances conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
her Sufferings before the Revolution, and the Behaviour
of the Epiſcopal Diſſenters ſince, being put all into the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
the Conſequence will ſhow the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> the
moſt Moderate, the fartheſt from Perſecution, and the
moſt Forbearing of any Eſtabliſh'd church in the World.</p>
            <p>It could not be expected, but that, upon the Revolution,
the Prelatic Tyranny would fall with the Regal; And,
were it worth Examining into, it would be eaſy to prove,
there was an Inevitable Neceſſity it ſhould do ſo, they being
ſo effectually ſupported one by another, that they could not
but ſtand and fall together.</p>
            <p>That the conjunct Tyranny of both Church and State had
Treated the Presbyterians with ſuch an Impolitic Fury, as
muſt imply, they had not the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſt Apprehenſion of being
ever pull'd down again by them, would be very evident, if
I ſhould enter here upon a particular of all that Treatment,
of all the Sufferings and Oppreſſions that People underwent;
The exact Hiſtory of which, tho it be very much wanted in
the World, yet I cannot think of entring upon it here, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
forced to it, in the juſt Defence of what is but hinted
at in theſe Papers.—</p>
            <p>Indeed the remote <hi>Idea's</hi> I had of theſe things, were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to have given me a Notion, that they had been h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

uſed; but I confeſs my ſelf amazed and ſurprized, when
at my enquiring into Particulars, I find all the Exceſſes of
Rapine, Violence, Blood, Cruelty, Torture and Barbarity,
that any Age can ſhow for ſeveral hundred years paſt in the
World, till at laſt it came to down-right Maſſacre; and the
Souldiers had power given them, <hi>and frankly Executed it,</hi> to drag
innocent people in time of full Peace, out of their Houſes,
and murder them at their diſcretion; terrible Inſtances of
which are to be given in ſeveral parts of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>If any man was to read the diſmal Stories of that Time,
and making the Caſe his own, reflect upon what he ſhould have
done in like caſe, when the Revolution put thoſe very people,
into the power of ſuch, whoſe Blood they had dipt their
Hands in, let him cenſure the enraged people if he can; <hi>in all
their Rabbles,</hi> they only drove their Curats away, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
plundered ſome of them; and was it not rather to be
expected, when gotten together in a Tumultuary way, they
ſhould have torn them to pieces, and ſacrificed them <hi>lege talione,</hi>
to the Ghoſts of their murdered Relations?</p>
            <p>However therefore I avoid entring into the Hiſtory of the
Perſecutions and Butcheries, exerciſed by the people we are
ſpeaking of, I cannot help ſaying here, that they are in their
general View, a moſt direct Teſtimony of the moderation of
the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland;</hi> that when Eſtabliſhed, they
contented themſelves with a bare Depoſing the thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bringing to Juſtice the perſons; among whom many of
the Clergy would have been found Principals, nay, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
even in ſome places Actors, in a moſt unuſual and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
manner.</p>
            <p>But to come to particulars, I mean, as to Church Conduct,
let us go back to the Revolution.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops being Depoſed, and the Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church being Reſtored and Eſtabliſhed in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
one of the firſt things which the Aſſembly did, was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of the planting Miniſters in the Church; and in order
to this it was Debated,</p>
            <p>1. Who were the people to be put out. And</p>
            <p>2. Who to be put in.</p>
            <p>As to the laſt, it is no part of the Subject here, nor at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
to the purpoſe: But as to the firſt, the Miniſters to be put ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
were of two ſorts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0021300300:12"/>
1. Scandalous, Ignorant, and Immoral perſons.</p>
            <p>2. Unqualified perſons.</p>
            <p>As to the Scandalous and Immoral, I hope no body will
call it Perſecution, that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> thought it her
Duty to have them removed; and that her Aſſemblies dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
applyed themſelves to the Doing it; and yet even in
the doing this moſt neceſſary piece of Juſtice to the Church,
the Lenity, the ſpace given for Reformation, the paſſing by
a great many, that in ſtrict Juſtice might have been
Depoſed; theſe are ſufficient Teſtimonies that it was not a
Spirit of Perſecution, Cruelty, or Severity, which acted the
Aſſemblies, or which acted the Commiſſioners deputed by
them, to Inſpect the Churches at that time; but a neceſſary
Juſtice, a Debt due to the Churches Safety, and to the work of
Reformation, and which they could with no tollerable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
either in Duty or Polity, have omitted.</p>
            <p>If in the Depoſing of Miniſters who appeared Scandalous
or Ignorant, the Party think fit to complain of Injuſtice and
Oppreſſion, Partiality and Perſecution; and think fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
me to Exhibit to the World, a Liſt of the Names and
Circumſtances of the ſeveral Miniſters Depoſed, and the
Charges againſt them; together with the Form how proved,
and how in moſt places confeſſed; I am content, and ſhall
on their firſt notice let the World ſee, who, and how many
Miniſters have been Depoſed by the Church, and for what;
&amp; the Article of Perſecution, ſhall with all my heart turn upon
the Merits of it; but if they would take my Advice, it ſhould
be to let this be one of the laſt things they do, leſt it
give the World too plain a Demonſtration of the abſolute
Neceſſity the church was under to Reform the Miniſtry, and
tell a little too plainly, what a ſort of Clergy they had to
deal with.</p>
            <p>The Depoſing Scandalous, Ignorant or Immoral perſons,
therefore I believe will not be called Perſecution.</p>
            <p>The whole Queſtion then muſt depend upon the ſecond
Head, <hi>viz.</hi> Depoſing Miniſters for not qualifying themſelves
according to Law; and tho' this is a direct Act of the State,
and is the ſame in <hi>England,</hi> now practiſed by the very ſame
High Church-Men that make this complaint; and I could
be very merry with our High-flying Jacobit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Clergy, who
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0021300300:13"/>
have Qualified themſelves in <hi>England,</hi> and yet retain their
Anti-Revolution-Principles—yet I wave that Advantage,
and I am content to call it, ſo far as the Church was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Inſtrument, I ſay I am content to call it the Act
and Deed of the Church; becauſe giving them all the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in their own way of arguing, <hi>however unfair,</hi> their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
will be with the greater force, and the more Fatal to
them.</p>
            <p>The Government was no ſooner Eſtabliſht by the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp; the Kirk Reſtor'd to her Judicatorial Authority, but her
ſeveral Courts, as Seſſion, Presbytery, Synod, and Aſſembly
took their courſes, and began to Act.</p>
            <p>By the firſt Act of Parliament for ſettling theſe Matters, paſt
<hi>June</hi> 7. 1690, Intituled, <hi>Act Ratifying the Confeſſion of Faith,
and Settling Presbyterian Church Government,</hi> It is Ordained,
<hi>That the General Aſſembly the Miniſters and Elders, ſhould have
Power to try and purge out all Inſufficient, Scandalous, and Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
Miniſters, by due Courſe of Eccleſiaſtick Proceſs and Cenſures;</hi>
But this Act no where Impower'd them to Cenſure any who
were not Inſufficient, Scandalous, or Erroneous, tho they
would not take the Oaths to the Government—. So that,
by this Law, the Church could not be capable of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>It may be objected here, That to be Epiſcopal, might be
adjudged Erroneous by this Judicatory, and ſo come under
the Church Cenſure, by Authority of this Act.</p>
            <p>To this 'tis Replyed—. Firſt, <hi>In Fact,</hi> No Man was ever
ſince the Revolution, Depoſed by the Church, meerly for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Epiſcopal, nor was any Proceſs ever commenc'd againſt
any Man on that Foundation.</p>

Epiſcopal Miniſter, whoſe Name may in time be
made more publick, would do well to tell them, whether
he was Deprived, which he calls Perſecution, for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,

               </gap>or Relapſe Fornication.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> To put this out of Queſtion, it was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
Declared by the Firſt General Aſſembly after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the Sixth Seſſion in the Year 1690, <hi>That
this Aſſembly will Depoſe no Incu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

anent the Government of the Church, nor Urge Re-ordination upon
them. Vid. Index</hi> of the Unprinted Acts of the Aſſembly,
<hi>Seſſ.</hi> 6. 1690.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Aſſembly, in their Inſtructions given to their
Commiſſion, which was to ſit during their Receſs, we have
theſe Words,</p>
            <p>That they be very Cautious of receiving Informations againſt the
late Conformiſts; And that they proceed in the Matter of Cenſure
very Deliberately, ſo as none may have Juſt Cauſe to Complain of
their Rigidity; And that they ſhall not proceed to Cenſure, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Relevant Libels and Sufficient Probation, <hi>Act 15th. Seſſ. 26th,
Aſſembly 1690.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, leſt the Presbyteries ſhould be Raſh or Severe, the
Commiſſion is Impowered as follows, <hi>That if they ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of any precipitant Procedure of the Presbyteries in ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſses,
to Reſtrain them. Vid.</hi> the ſame Act as above.</p>
            <p>If then they were thus Moderate even in Scandalous Things,
and Declared againſt proceeding in Caſes meerly Epiſcopal,
where ſhall we find the Article of Perſecution?</p>
            <p>'Tis true, That, in the Year 1693, an Act of Parliament
was made to Deprive all ſuch Miniſters, as would not both
Swear to the Government, and Acknowledge the Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
alſo, and the Confeſſion of Faith—. But the
Occaſion of this Act is Viſible to all that know the Affai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
of that Time—, that it was paſt to ſatisfy the Minds
of the People, who were exceedingly Diſturb'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the
Churches having been Inſulted in the Aſſembly 1692,
by a general <hi>Formula</hi> procured by the Epiſcopal Clergy, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their Appeal to the King on a Refuſal: And the
Aſſembly being abruptly Diſſolved, or Diſmiſſed <hi>ſine die,</hi>
which put the Nation into a very great Fermentation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0021300300:15"/>
Yet, upon this Act, I may challenge the Epiſcopal Clergy to
ſhow me one Miniſter, that ever was Depoſed for not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the Church, if at the ſame time he offered to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Government, and take the Oaths, and they
have been often challenged on this Head.</p>
            <p>And to confirm this Lenity of Practice by a Law, that
Famous Act of Parliament was made in the Year 1695<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
wherein taking the Oaths to the Government is made the <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>Fully Sufficient</hi> Qualification, and all Miniſters that
would ſo <hi>Qualifie themſelves</hi> are continued. As may be ſeen
at large by the Act, Intituled, <hi>Act Concerning the Church,
Anno</hi> 1695.</p>
            <p>This very Act of Parliament, if I were to go no further,
effectually clears the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the charge of
Perſecution; ſince 'tis plain there was no religious Tenet in
diſpute, but a civil Queſtion of owning or not owning the
Government.</p>
            <p>It was by this Act of Parliament taken quite out of the
power of the Church, to Depoſe any Man meerly for being
Epiſcopal in principle, or for refuſing to owne the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Church; nay the Epiſcopal Clergy who, by virtue of this
Act, remain in their Livings, many of them to this day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to acknowledge the Church, to ſubmit to any of her
Judicatories, or to joyn, either in Diſcipline or Worſhip; and
yet in all their Affronts of the Eſtablish'd Church, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in their Paroches, preaching and uſing all their Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
however, contrary to the inclinations and deſires of
the people, who in ſome places are fain to ſet up Meeting-Houſes
in their Paroches, and be at the charge of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Presbyterian Miniſter as a Diſſenter, to preach to them,
becauſe they cannot bear the Fopperies and Oppoſition of
their paroch Miniſter.</p>
            <p>I would fain have thoſe people that cry out of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Epiſcopal Clergy, go to ſome of theſe Paroches,
and ſee this uncouth Jeſt, where the perſecuting eſtabliſh'd
Church is fain to ſubmit to a Meeting-houſe, and the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
Epiſcopal Clergy-man inſults them from the pariſh-Church,
and keeps both the Pulpit and the Stipend, in ſpight
of them all.—Here is the eſtabliſh'd Church turn'd Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter,
and the Diſſenter made the Incumbent; the Perſecutor
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0021300300:16"/>
become the perſecuted, and <hi>per contra</hi> the perſecuted made
the perſecutor. But of this more preſently.</p>
            <p>The Churches power to perſecute, being thus limited by
Act of Parliament, it remains to Examine, in what manner
ſhe has Exerciſed that Power ſhe had; for in this Article muſt
ly the Matter of this Charge, or they muſt have more than a
ſpirit of Divination that can find it out.</p>
            <p>In order to this, I muſt enquire what this Power they had
was, and that is a very ſhort Queſtion—Their Power, 'tis
plain, was only againſt ſuch Miniſters who were Scandalous,
&amp;c. as before, or would not take the Oaths to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor pray for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether they were, or were not abſolutely bound up to
Cenſure all ſuch as would not thus qualifie themſelves, is a
Queſtion I ſhall ſpeak to hereafter.</p>
            <p>It follows to Examine how the Church has Executed this
Power; and whether Lenity or Severity has been her Temper
in the caſe; and to ſtate this, as clearly as poſſible, I muſt
make the Gentlemen one fair propoſal.</p>
            <p>Before I entred upon this Work, I have not only ſearched
into all the publick Records of this Matter, which I could
have Acceſs to, but have made as ſtrict Enquiry, as poſſibly
I could, of the moſt Impartial and Unbyaſs'd Perſons, for
any particular Caſe, wherein any Excurſion might have been
beyond this Power, or wherein the Charge of Perſecution
might ly—. And having done this with the utmoſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality,
and not being able to find any thing; and having
not the Honour to be Acquai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted with any of the Depoſed
Clergy, who might have furniſh'd me with ſome of the
particulars; I cannot but earneſtly intreat ſome of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Gentlemen, who have ſuffered under theſe ſevere Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions,
to tell the World what they are, and wherein the
Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> has, either exceeded her Limited Power,
or indeed fully exerted it in any Caſe, ſo, as to deſerve the
black Charge of Perſecution; Aſſuring them, that if I
could, by all my Search and Inquiry, <hi>tho now upon the Spot,</hi>
have found out but one Inſtance, in which the Church had
thus perſecuted them, or any of them, I would never
have wrote one Line in her Defence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0021300300:17"/>
Perhaps, it may be alledged here, That Impoſing Oaths up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Miniſters, who, <hi>thinking themſelves bound by former Oath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
to their late King,</hi> could not in Conſcience comply with
them, is Perſecution; eſpecially when it is conſidered, that
this Impoſing the ſaid Oaths was enforced, on pain of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation;
And the Scruples of theſe Oaths, in many, who
could otherwiſe have complyed, being meerly conſcientious, to
deprive them on that Account, is Perſecution in the Abſtract,
being Perſecution purely for Conſcience ſake.</p>
            <p>In Anſwering this, <hi>which is the moſt material thing can be ſaid,</hi>
I muſt make ſeveral Remarks.</p>
            <p>I. Really Gentlemen, ſpeaking to the Complainers in
the South; thoſe of the Clergy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
at all, are only perſecuted on this Account: And
therein two things will follow:</p>
            <p>1. That all the Diſſenting Clergy in <hi>Scotland</hi> are <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites,</hi>
and ſuffer only for refuſing to take the Oaths to
the Government.</p>
            <p>2. That really the—<hi>Jacobite</hi> Clergy in the North of
<hi>Britain,</hi> are much Honeſter Men than their Brethren in the
South; ſince thoſe univerſally have ſuffered Deprivation
and Loſs of their Livings for their Principle: But, in
the South, Hundreds retaining, <hi>in their Equivocating
Way,</hi> their Loyalty in Principle to their Abdicated King,
have Loaded themſelves with Oaths, Abjurations, and
every thing the Government has thought fit to lay upon
them; And yet, on all Occaſions, Act againſt that
very Government they Swear to—Publickly Pray
for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and now for Queen
<hi>Anne</hi>—And Privately for King <hi>James,</hi> both Father
and Son: Drink Queen <hi>Ann</hi>'s Health and King <hi>James</hi>
the VIIIth's Alternately, or Occaſionally, as ſuites their
Company: Theſe are a ſort of Hypocrites equally De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
by both Parties, and equally Dangerous to both.
But of this by the way.</p>
            <p>II. If the putting theſe Gentlemen out of their Livings
be a Perſecution, then the Church and Government in
<hi>England</hi> have been as guilty of Perſecution, as the Church
and Government in <hi>Scotland;</hi> ſince all the Clergy in
one, as well as in the other, were depoſed, and turned
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0021300300:18"/>
out, who would not take the Oaths: And the High
Church-Men, who have joyn'd themſelves to the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and conſequently made themſelves Parties to
that kind of Perſecution, ought, by no means, to call
it ſo in <hi>Scotland,</hi> unleſs they are content to ſhare the
Scandal.</p>
            <p>III. The Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> even under all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of Tolleration, are as much perſecuted as the
Epiſcopal Clergy in <hi>Scotland;</hi> ſince not one of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
can Preach, (the <hi>Quakers</hi> excepted) without
taking the ſame Oaths; And not only ſo, but ſigning
the Confeſſion of Faith of the Eſtabliſh'd Church, a
few ſmall <hi>Proviſo's</hi> for their particular Principles only
excepted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> All this Perſecution, if it can be called by
that Name, is the Act and Deed of the State; 'Tis a
Debt to the publick Peace, 'tis the neceſſary Conſequence
of the Revolution, and of the Aboliſhing Epiſcopacy,
things wholly National, Antecedent to the Church
Settlement, and not at all the Act or Concern of the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor can it be brought as part of a
Charge againſt them.</p>
            <p>I come now to Examine, how the Church has Extended
and Exerted the real Power ſhe has, and how far ſhe has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in the very Execution of the Law; And if I do prove
here, That ſhe has been ſo far from enforcing theſe Laws, or
putting forth her Power in Extremities or Severities, that ſhe
has rather neglected her own Safety, ſuffered her ſelf to be
imperfectly ſettled, her Power contemned, her Miniſters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted,
her Acts of Aſſembly ſlighted, and her Diſcipline diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And this only, becauſe ſhe was loth to puſh
things to Extremities, loth to make Examples, loth to uſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities,
and willing, as much as could conſiſt with Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Safety, to ſpare, bear with, and deal gently with
thoſe, who, in their Power, ſhew'd her no Favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and even,
under this Treatment, ſhew her no manner of Reſpect—, If<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I ſay, I prove this, I think I ſhall effectually clear her of the
Slander, ſo induſtriouſly ſpread abroad, and ſo poſitively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,
of her being of perſecuting Principles: And if I do
not prove this, I do nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0021300300:19"/>
I confeſs, this will drive me to the Neceſſity of Expoſing
ſome of the Names of theſe Gentlemen, who, by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance
and Lenity of the Church, peaceably enjoy, <hi>tho I
cannot ſay they gratefully acknowledge it,</hi> thoſe Benefices and Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
which they had, by their other Circumſtance, Forfeited
to the Laws; But the neceſſary Defence of Truth obliging
me to it, thoſe Gentlemen muſt blame their Friends, who
have made this unhappy Neceſſity, not me, who, I aſſure
them, have no perſonal Grudge either at them, or at the
Connivance granted them, and only wiſh they would, in a
more peaceable and reſpectful manner, enjoy it.</p>
            <p>The Liſt of Names contains two Ranks or ſorts of People,
and either of them are Teſtimonies of the publick Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
one of the Government, and one of the Church in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
and both of them will ſerve to make the Complaint
of Perſecution and Severities look very odly.</p>
            <p>The Liſts are twofold, and not to interrupt the Thread of
Diſcourſe, I have plac'd one of them by way of <hi>Appendix</hi> at the
end of this Book; I have forborn abundance of Reflections, and
juſt Remarks on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ircumſtances, and particular Conduct
of the Gentlemen named there: Not that I am ignorant of the
particulars, and ſhall, at any time gratify them with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Comments upon them, if they deſire it—, But to let
them ſee, that even, in this Account, I forbear to expoſe
them farther, than the neceſſary Defence of the Caſe before
me calls for; and I am very ſorry they have done any thing
to bring this upon them.</p>
            <p>By the firſt Liſt which I have not printed, but in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Regiſters any one may ſee it, it will appear, that there
are now Preaching, and poſſeſſing their reſpective Pariſh
Churches, above threeſcore Miniſters, who were profeſtly
and openly Epiſcopal; but, on their ſubmitting to, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the Presbyterian Eſtabliſhment, were received
to Miniſterial Communion, and many of them are now
worthy Members of the preſent Church; by which one
thing will be unanſwerably proved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>viz.</hi> That not one Epiſcopal Miniſter, in the whole
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> has been Depoſed for his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
That is, not for his being Epiſcopal, or for his
Non-conformity to the eſtabliſh'd Presbyterian Church,
but meerly for <hi>Jacobitiſm,</hi> for his refuſing to own
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0021300300:20"/>
the Government, and acknowledge the Queen; ſince,
would he have taken the Oaths, and prayed for the
Sovereign, it was not in the Power of the General <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
which is the Repreſentative of the Church,
to depoſe or perſecute them at all.</p>
            <p>I know this will be a ſurprizing thing to abundance of
Honeſt People in <hi>England,</hi> who hitherto have had other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and I cannot but deſire them to conſider,</p>
            <p>1. How impoſſible it is to be true, that the Church
of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould perſecute the Epiſcopal Clergy for
their Non-conformity, when, by Act of Parliament, it
was not in their Power to moleſt or depoſe any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
however Epiſcopal in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rinciple or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ractice, if
he would but take the Oaths to the Government, and
pray for the King or Queen; and when it was in their
Power, they reponed all thoſe that would come in.</p>
            <p>2. This clears the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ivil Government alſo, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any way cruel, ſevere, or perſecuting to the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Clergy; ſince all they required, was only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the Civil Magiſtrate, and Complying with
the Laws of the Land—. And in this Caſe, it
would be worth notice alſo, how different the Terms of
this Conformity were in this Government, from the like
Terms of Conformity in the Times of Epiſcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
—. In this the Penalty of Refuſing was
only Deprivation of their Benefices in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lergy, and
in the Laity nothing at all; in thoſe Days, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Impriſonment, and Death at the Mercy of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Soldier, was the Lot not of the Clergy only, but of
every Perſon, and many have been murdered in cold
Blood, without Mercy, for refuſing not only to ſwear
to the King, but only for refuſing to ſay, <hi>GOD Save
the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know the poor People are branded here with Weakneſs
and Obſtinacy—. But two things ſeem to be a preſent
Anſwer to that,</p>
            <p>1. Theſe were but a few, and thoſe of the meaneſt
and weakeſt of the People.</p>
            <p>2. The weaker the People, the more cruel and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
the Severity of thoſe times, that ſhould put them
to Death for ſuch Trifles, taking them by the Handle
of their miſtaken Nicety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0021300300:21"/>
3. It is evident, it was only taking Advantage of
the Zeal of a People, which run beyond the Bounds of
Reaſon—. Since, if they had not had that Handle,
they would have ſought ſome other: And it was plain,
that where they found the People complying with thoſe
Demands, they 'ſcap'd not the better, but they always
found Pretences to murder them.</p>
            <p>4. The poor People are not ſo much to be blam'd,
ſince they underſtood, <hi>GOD Save the King,</hi> was, to
pray GOD to proſper the King in the Perſecution of
their Brethren.</p>
            <p>'Tis farther confirm'd, That the Civil Government
has not perſecuted, or been cruel or ſevere to theſe
Gentlemen; ſince not only they continued all the
Miniſters, that would give but the Security of their
Oaths for their peaceable Behaviour, a thing no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the World would diſpenſe with: <hi>But, ſince
that,</hi> the Treatment of thoſe that have been Depoſed has
been ſuch, ſo Gentle, ſo Tender, and ſo Forbearing,
as I believe, all Circumſtances conſidered, no Nation in
the World can parallel; Of which, and their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to the Government, under that Lenity, I may
ſpeak by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And I cannot but recommend the Gentlemen, Who are
Complainers here, to Her Majeſties Anſwer to the Depoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
clergy, who Addreſſed, in the Beginning of Her Reign,
for their Liberty, <hi>viz.</hi> To behave themſelves peaceably, and
ſubject themſelves to the Government; Which, however
ſome of them were willing to conſtrue as a Declaration of
Liberty, and to uſe it in a different way from Her Majeſties
Intention, they might have found more Reaſon, had they
Judged Impartially, to have taken for a Reproof of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable
Behaviour, and ungrateful Temper to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which had ſo Gently Treated them.</p>
            <p>Again I obſerve, as this effectually clears the
Government of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the Charge of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
So <hi>the Second Liſt</hi> will, with much more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and no doubt, to the Aſtoniſhment of a great part of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, who ſhall read it, abundantly clear up
the Reputation of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the Horrid

Slander of Perſecution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being an Account of 165 Epiſcopal

by the meer forbearance of the Church, are now peaceably
enjoying their Benefices, Stipends, and Appurtenances,

of the moſt oppoſite Principles to the Eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>Would any Man that knew all this, have the face to ſay,
this is a Perſecuting Church? would any Church in the World
that had a legal and National Eſtabliſhment, ſuffer, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyance

            <p>Perhaps it may be ask'd here, What is it ſhe bears
with? and I know great Noiſe is made, that the Episcopal
people here are not ſo different as in <hi>England</hi> from the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
having no Service-Book, Habits, or Ceremonies;
and therefore the things they bear with are but Trifles, and
the Moderation the leſs to be inſiſted on.</p>
            <p>But this is not ſo eaſie to make good as to ſay, for 'tis not

of the Difference in <hi>England,</hi> any more than here; and if the
Difference is but a Trifle, the Argument is ſtronger againſt
thoſe who for Trifles divide from the eſtabliſh'd Church,
than againſt the eſtabliſh'd Church who expect their Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>

the Church thus behaves, and with whoſe Inſolency ſhe

no eſtabliſhed Church in the World that I have ever read

            <p>And to deſcend a little to particulars, it may be obſerved,
that they, <hi>I mean generally ſpeaking,</hi> in all, or moſt part of the

the Church.</item>
               <item>6. They Ordain no Elders.</item>
               <item>7. They Examine not their Communicants before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,

            <p>I do not ſay every one of them are guilty of all theſe Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions—.
But all are guilty of ſome of them; ſome of all of
them; and others of more than theſe—. And to this may
be added, that they are univerſally declar'd Jacobites, and
profeſſed Enemies to the Proteſtant Succeſſion.</p>
            <p>Would any Man now imagine, that this hot, furious, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting

you; and if you have any Honeſty, and Gratitude, any
Senſe of Kindneſs upon you, do Juſtice to thoſe, who, in

diſowning theirs, forborn to obey even their known Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

I might here give a Liſt of Miniſters, who having been De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
or ſuſpended by reſpective Presbyteries, or by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
appointed to Inſpect, have yet, by the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Church in the Commiſſion of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
been reponed, and placed in their Livings again, only
upon feigned Submiſſions, Promiſes of Conformity to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
Lecturing before Sermon, and the like; and yet, as
ſoon as re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>plac'd, have renounced thoſe Submiſſions in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
return'd to their former Omiſſions, left off Lecturing,
re-aſſumed their little Formalities, and profeſs'd themſelves
openly Epiſcopal, and yet the Church has taken no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
againſt them.</p>
            <p>I might, as I hinted before, give a Liſt of Miniſters, whoſe
open Omiſſion of Diſcipline, Lecturing, and all manner of
Church Order, together with their Slackneſs, Meanneſs, and
Formalities in their Performances, are ſo perfectly diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their People, that they are obliged to get Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Miniſters to preach in Meeting-Houſes like Diſſenters
among them, and yet the Church bears with all this, rather
than perſecute them—. But I omit theſe things, till I am
farther neceſſitated to expoſe them; but they that queſtion
the Fact may inquire about Mr. <hi>Patrick Lyon</hi> at <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>John Anderſon</hi> late at <hi>Dyſert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> and at ſeveral other
places, where they may be fully ſatisfyed of moſt of the
particulars.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Treatment thoſe really called Diſſenters,
thoſe who are actually Depoſed meet with from the Church,
and this will almoſt force me to enter a little into a long and
black Account of the Treatment the Church meets with from
them, in which I ſhall however be very tender, being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to expoſe any Bodies Frailties more than meer neceſſity
forces me to.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but if I ſhould ſay, that theſe Diſſenting,
Epiſcopal Miniſters, who are thus Depoſed, do, now and
then, take the Liberty very privately to preach, it would,
with ſome Wonder, and more Difficulty, be believed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
where the general Opinion is, <hi>ſo ſtrangely have People
been Impoſed upon,</hi> that they are intirely ſuppreſt, that they
dare not meet or exerciſe any Religious Worſhip; that they
are dayly inſulted by Mobs, and purſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d by the Seſſion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0021300300:25"/>
and Presbyteries, meerly for ſerving GOD according to their
Conſciences.</p>
            <p>But how will theſe People behave themſelves? How will
ye be amaz'd to think in what manner you have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon? And how eaſily you have ſuffered your
ſelves to be abuſed? When I ſhall aſſure you, that not
one Word of all this is true; When I ſhall tell you, that
the Epiſcopal Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> enjoy at this time, and have
done for ſeveral Years, all the Liberty which the Diſſenters
in <hi>England</hi> do now enjoy, and that with Conditions vaſtly
differing.</p>
            <p>I<hi>ſt,</hi> They have their full Liberty by the meer Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Forbearance of the Government, which in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
could never be obtained but in little Intervals, but
by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>2. They have the ſame Liberty, tho they not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to take the Oaths, but refuſe to ſign the Doctrinal
Articles of the Confeſſion of Faith, tho even the Church
of <hi>England</hi> owns them to be all Orthodox, a thing the
Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> are not permitted in, no not by
the Act of Tolleration.</p>
            <p>3. They enjoy this Liberty, notwithſtanding they
openly, and in their publick Aſſemblies, not only o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
praying for the Queen, but ſome of them actually
and diſtinctly pray for their <hi>James</hi> the VIII, and for his
Reſtoration, which is not only praying for a Popiſh
Prince, but praying GOD to depoſe or cut off Her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Majeſty, and Affront ſo horridly Impious, and ſo
Offenſive to all Her Majeſties Subjects, that one
would wonder the moſt Moderate Principle in the
World could bear with it.</p>
            <p>And what will you ſay now Gentlemen of the High Church
in <hi>England?</hi> When I ſhall tell you, there are now fourteen or
ſixteen of theſe Meeting-Houſes in the City of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> juſt
in the Face of the General Aſſembly of the Church, and in the
Eyes of the Government, and that in any Town or place in the
Kingdom, where they have Hearers, they have the ſame—.
That in ſome of theſe, they have newly ſet up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer Book, a thing in the Heighth of Epiſcopacy they
never attempted, and which even the Epiſcopal Party in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0021300300:26"/>
were never reconciled to—. And that, in not one
of theſe Meetings, that ever I heard of, the Queen is pray'd
for by Name, but in ſome directly they pray for the King,
which muſt mean their <hi>James</hi> the VIII, or worſe, and in
others they pray in ambiguous Words, ſuch as <hi>THE QUEEN,</hi>
or the <hi>ROYAL FAMILY,</hi> and if I am not miſinformed, in
ſome for King <hi>James</hi> the eighth in ſo many Words.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that in theſe open Inſults both of Government
and Church, they have in their Turn, met with ſome few
Oppoſitions from the people who have been provoked at
ſuch Indignities done to their Sovereign, and to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the face of the Sun; and theſe little Rabbles
they would call Perſecution—and yet even in theſe caſes
the Government has carefully ſuppreſt the Tumult, and
voluntarly made Reparation to private Families, for the
Damnages they have pretended to have ſuſtained, and that
often beyond the real Spoil, tho' at the ſame time their own
Imprudent and provoking Carriage has been the principal
Occaſion of theſe Damnages; and this is evident in the City
of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> in particular, the only time they can talk of, where
the Rabble aſſaulting a <hi>Jacobite</hi> Conventicle, or Epiſcopal Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>For there is very little difference between them at any time,
and leſs there, than on moſt Occaſions,</hi> the City payed the Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Houſe ſeveral hundred pounds <hi>ſterling,</hi> for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Damnage he received; <hi>Which in all appearance ſo far
exceeded his Loſs,</hi> that 'tis no breach of Charity to believe, he
would be pleaſed to have his Houſe Rabbled once a Week at
the ſame price.</p>
            <p>Nor would I have any High-flying Church of <hi>England</hi>
Man inſiſt upon this ſort of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Behold now, Gentlemen, in the South, the Cruelties and
Severities, the Perſecutions, and furious Deaſings of the
Presbyterian Church in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and where is the Sufferings

ſays, They exceed the Dragoonings in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am told, there is a remaining Objection yet behind,
<hi>viz.</hi> That even theſe Diſſenting Miniſters that have been
put out for not taking the Oaths, are perſecuted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
for the private Exerciſe of their Function as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and for that, have been ſeverely treated.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry to be driven to the Neceſſity of telling ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Truths, which I wiſh were concealed; I mean of
ſuch practices as will not reflect upon the Parties we ſpeak of
only, but upon the whole Proteſtant Body of Chriſtians in
the World; And therefore I entreat the Gentlemen not to
oblige me to publiſh the particulars in Vindication of the
Church, who would be unaccountably negligent, and even
their Enemies themſelves would Reproach them with it. If
ſuch things as are not fit to be Nam'd among Chriſtians,
ſhould have been ſuffered to be practiſed by Miniſters of the
Goſpel, and they that had a Power and Right of Judicatory,
ſhould have been ſilent in it, for fear of the ſcandal of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</p>
            <p>And ſhould I here enter only into an Enquiry about the
Inceſtuous Marriages, the frequent marrying Men to other
Mens Wives, and Women to other Womens Husbands; or
in ſhort, a general Joyning together perſons as Man and
Wife, without either Publication in the Church, which is
the general Law of the Nation, or ſufficient Information of
Circumſtances, which in common prudence and Defence of
their own Reputation, they might be ſuppoſed to do—. If
theſe things I ſay, and the Miſchiefs that have followed,
ſhould be brought on the Stage, to juſtifie the legal Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the Church has made on that account, it would make
ſad work in the Characters of the perſons. The Gentlemen
therefore muſt not pretend to call it Perſecution; the omiſſion

            <p>Excepting therefore ſuch ſcandalous Practices, which the

            <p>Their lawful Marriages are not at all controverted; and if
due Publication be made according to Law, that Inceſts and
Adulteries may be prevented, they have not been prohibited
to Marry; They Baptize, and that without the Parent ſubjecting

it, and ſcruples none of their Baptiſms, nor Re-baptizes any.</p>

you taken the Oaths, you had never been put out of the

            <p>If I may therefore offer my Opinion Gentlemen, my

where you are and be ſatisfied, for a Legal Tolleration will
be your Ruine—. I would offer one thing more, if you
can accept of Advice, <hi>and that is,</hi> that you would regulate
your Conduct ſo as Diſſenters, and act ſo like Chriſtians
and Miniſters, that your Friends in the Church of <hi>England</hi>
may not be aſham'd of you, or aſham'd to interceed for
you—. That you would no more be the Refuge of the
Vitious, the Skreen of the Adulterer, the Protectors of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral
and Prophane Perſons; If you would be thought Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Diſſenters, let us ſee ſomething of Religion among
you, ſomething of Diſcipline and Order, that the Sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of the Chriſtian Church may not be abuſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by you—. And that the eſtabliſh'd Church may
be encouraged to be eaſy with you, and may not be oblig'd,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0021300300:31"/>
in her own Defence, and for the Support of common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
to proſecute you for unſufferable Irregularities, and
you be dayly complaining of thoſe Proceedings under the
ſham Name of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erſecution.</p>
            <p>I know not whether you will pleaſe to accept of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
or no; perhaps, be it never ſo good, you will reject it
for the ſake of its diſagreeable Author, <hi>but be that as you
pleaſe,</hi> I am ſure the Caution is for your Advantage, uſe it
as you think fit.</p>
            <p>If I was to turn the Diſcourſe to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it
ſhould be—Have no more Concern about this Matter
Gentlemen, be not afraid of the Miſchiefs of Tolleration; if
the Epiſcopal Clergy, or any Body for them, complain, if
they deſire a Tolleration, tell them, <hi>with all your Hearts,</hi> on
the ſame Terms the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> have it, they ſhall
have it when they pleaſe: And ſince the Tolleration of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
in <hi>England</hi> is made the great Argument for Tollerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here, they cannot have the Face to deſire better Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
than thoſe Diſſenters are contented with—. And
fear not the Conſequences, either they will accept it <hi>thus,</hi> or
they will not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If they will accept it,</hi> from that Moment you may Date the
Deſtruction of their Party, and the Aboliſhing the very
Name of Diſſenting in <hi>Scotland, as before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If they will not accept it,</hi> you are for ever clear, either of the
Reproach of having denyed it to them, or of the Slander ſo
much Noiſe has been made of, I mean <hi>Perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I cannot omit one <hi>Note</hi> here, and that turns the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

            </p>
            <p>I do not make an Exception for the Gift and Conſent of
the Church here, as if that could Qualify ſuch a Law—For
even the Grant and Conſent of the Church could not now
make it Lawful; the Church cannot now give away her own
Rights, they are a Debt to Poſterity, and ſhe is bound equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the Government, <hi>in all Succeeding Generations,</hi> by the
Obligations of the Union.</p>
            <p>But I grant the Church may, by their Moderation, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Tenderneſs, ſuffer and permit the Epiſcopal Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to Exerciſe their ſeparate way of Worſhip, without Exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Power of Government to their Diſturbance, and
this I hope they will continue to do: And this leads me
naturally to two things, by way of Caution, to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>1. This Lenity and Moderation is already practiſed
to you, and the Church does bear with you, even to
Exceſs, <hi>if that Word</hi> be ſuitable to Moderation, and it
cannot be grateful in you, to puſh your Complaints
to ſuch Extremities, and to force the Friends of the
Church to defend themſelves and her, by ſtating the
Caſe fairly in the Sight of the World; Since, in thoſe
Defences, ſome things muſt neceſſarily appear to your
Diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0021300300:33"/>
2. It cannot but move you to behave ſo, as to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the Continuance of that Moderation; For if it be
only in the Power of the Church, to make you eaſy,
as I believe will appear at laſt, you may deſpiſe it as
much as you pleaſe, but your only prudent way is to
deſerve it, by a Modeſt, Peaceable, and Chriſtian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour;
and when you have tryed all other ways,
perhaps you may be the better convinc'd of the Seaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs
of ſuch Advice, and this I leave to time to
open your Eyes in.</p>

This is the Liſt mentioned in <hi>Page 23d.</hi> of this Tract, many
of whom, to this day, behave themſelves to the Eſtabliſh'd
Church, much wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e than the profeſt <hi>Jacobites</hi> and Non-ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Diſſenters, inſulting the Church Judicatories, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Defiance to their Authority—. Behaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with all manner of Rudeneſs and Indecency.</p>
            <p>Intruding into Churches without the Call of the People,
or any Legal Proceeding, and keeping Poſſeſſion againſt the
direct Authority of the Church, in Defiance of the reſpective
Presbyteries, and contrary to the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>Theſe indeed are things which deſerve a farther Diſcovery
to the World, and may in time have it done to their Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
But, mean time, the Matter of Fact is ſufficient
to the preſent Caſe, and the Inquiry into particulars may
remain to another Occaſion.—</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>I Cannot conclude this Affair, without nothing ſomething
to the ſeveral Parties.</p>
            <p>1. To the Epiſcopal Diſſenters, I do not ſay nor ſuggeſt,
that there are none of them, who are Religious, Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Diſſenters, and Diſſent meerly on Account of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
tho I believe ſuch are very few—. But to ſuch, I ſay,
the Church is, <hi>and I would be ſorry they were not,</hi> as Tender as
poſſible; They do not exclude them from even Miniſterial
Communion, if they pleaſe to accept it; Nor do they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Lay Diſſenters from any Church Privileges, or
impoſe any Terms of Communion upon them.</p>
            <p>2. To the Depoſed Clergy, I would put them in Mind
to examine, whether the Clergy of the preſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hurch have
not behaved to them, with Humanity and Charity in their
private Capacities, as well as in their publick; Whether
they have not raiſed large Contributions among them, of
meer Tenderneſs to their Circumſtances, and given them
conſiderable Sums for their Relief; Whether they have not
endeavoured to recover the Funds formerly raiſed, called the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0021300300:39"/>
               <hi>Centeſima,</hi> being a Proviſion for the Widows and Orphans
of the Clergy, and ordered it to be ſet apart for the Widows
and Orphans of the Epiſcopal Clergy only; And whether
they do not continue dayly to relieve the Diſſenting Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Clergy by Collections, and giving themſelves largely
to their Supply.</p>
            <p>3. To thoſe who may be forward to object, that I ſeem
to Invade the Churches Intrinſic Power, in ſaying, ſhe had
her Power to Act in an Eſtabliſh'd Method from an Act of
Parliament, <hi>P.</hi> To theſe I ſay, if they pleaſe to
compare it with other places of this Book, they will find no
Room for that Thought; Nor am I concerned to enter here
into that Debate, I take the Act in the Senſe the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
it, <hi>viz,</hi> A Civil Sanction to their Power, which, if
it did not add to their Real Power, might however add
to the Publick Regard pay'd to that Power.</p>
            <p>4. To theſe who object, that I here acknowlege the
Church has not done her Duty, and that if ſhe had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted,
ſhe ought to have done it, I leave them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
again a Declaration of the Church of <hi>England</hi> lately
made at the Head of the Occaſional Bill, <hi>viz.</hi> That Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
for Conſcience is inconſiſtent with, and contrary to
the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As to the Liſt above-mentioned, I do not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
ſay, none of the Perſons there named, have never
taken the Oaths, tho I am told they have not, no not one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But that they are all openly and declaredly Epiſcopal, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no Man will Debate with me.</p>
            <p>I however make theſe Cautionary Hints, becauſe I know
I am to expect all the Cavil Angry Men can raiſe at this
Book, which nevertheleſs I hope, tho in my abſence it may
have no Defender, will ſtand upon its own Foundation
of Truth in Fact, and I am ſure has been wrote with al
poſſible Caution as to perſonal Wrong.—</p>
