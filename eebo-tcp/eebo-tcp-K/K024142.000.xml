            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0235302900:4"/>COMPASSION, or a friendly Senſe of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the Misfortunes of our Fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, was originally implanted in our Minds by the great Author of them, and deſign'd as the Alarms of a kind and impartial Father to engage us to relieve a diſtreſs'd Brother: And hence it ariſes, that our Hearts, like muſical Strings, feel every Vibration which is made on thoſe of our Friend, or our Neighbour, and do as it were inſenſibly and involuntarily beat to each others Pleaſures and Pains.</p>
            <p>AMONGST our modern Pretenders to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Philoſophy, there have not indeed been wanting Men of low and contracted Minds, of ſullen and unfeeling Diſpoſitions, who by ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arguments, and artful Refinements, have endeavour'd to degrade the Dignity of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and rob us of every ſocial Virtue. Good-nature and Beneficence have been term'd Self-intereſt and Diſſimulation; Humanity branded with the Name of Weakneſs; and Compaſſion derided as a Folly.</p>
            <p>WHETHER it be owing to the falſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of ſuch Writers, who ſo induſtriouſly blend the Colours of Virtue and Vice as to render it almoſt impoſſible to ſeparate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them, or to the natural Depravity of Mankind, heighten'd and inflam'd by the ill Examples of a licentious Age, or both together,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0235302900:5"/>
is hard to be determined; but certain it is, that we are at preſent ſo loſt in the idle Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or ſwallow'd up in the Debaucheries of the World, that almoſt all the Ties of Nature are broken through or neglected, and ſocial Love and Affection baniſh'd from the Breaſts of Men. Alliances are made, and Friendſhips contracted without that mutual Love and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which alone can render them laſting or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable: We are willing enough to <hi>rejoice with them that rejoice,</hi> to partake of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and good Succeſs of others; but will not <hi>weep with them when they weep, or mourn with them that mourn.</hi> Men in ſhort are but too well acquainted with the Follies, the Vices and the Faults of their Neighbours, and only Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to their Misfortunes.</p>
            <p>THERE are Ills enough, ſays the ſelfiſh Man, cruel and unavoidable Ills, which fall to my own Share; why then muſt I increaſe the Burthen by bearing the Weight of others? <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for my Day is the Evil thereof.</hi> Thus trifling and inſignificant are the Arguments of theſe Men, who would ſhelter their Pride and Inhumanity under the Maſk of Prudence, and dreſs up the low and ſordid Vice of Selfiſhneſs in the Habit of Virtue. Such have little Title to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of that Nature they partake of; but are to be look'd on as Limbs cut off from the Body of Society, as wither'd and ſapleſs Branches, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0235302900:6"/>
yield neither Shade nor Fruit; <hi>fit only to be hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down and caſt into the Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TRUE <hi>Religion and undefiled before</hi> GOD, ſays our SAVIOUR, <hi>is this; to viſit the Fatherleſs and Widows in their Affliction.</hi> A Religion, which, as he taught, he practiſed alſo. He was himſelf a <hi>Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief:</hi> Surely he hath born our Sorrows, and ſuffer'd for our Iniquities; and ſhall we not ſhew that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to our Fellow-creatures, which he ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly beſtow'd on us; or dare we flatter our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that, if we neglect this impartial Duty, the ſame all-ſeeing GOD, who condemns our Inhumanity, will not alſo puniſh our Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude?</p>
            <p>WEEP <hi>with them,</hi> ſays the wiſe Man; that is, with all them <hi>that weep.</hi> He does not ſay with our Parents, our Relations, or our Children; but embraces the whole Range of Nature, and takes in all Mankind. Even our Enemies are to be pitied and relieved. If the Man, who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured us, falls into Affliction, we are no longer to conſider him as an Adverſary, whom we hate, but as a Fellow-creature we muſt aſſiſt. We may remember he is not our Friend, but we muſt not forget he is our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>BUT if the Motives of Reaſon and Religion are not ſufficient to perſuade us, Self-Intereſt, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0235302900:7"/>
reigns in every Breaſt, will exert her Powers to excite us to it. The Tear we refuſe to ſhed over the miſeries of others, GOD, and GOD only knows, how ſoon we may ſtand in need of. <hi>Great Travail is created for every Man, and an heavy Yoke is upon the Sons of Adam; from him that ſitteth upon a Throne of Glory to him that is humbled in Earth and Aſhes.</hi> How often does an unexpected Stroke of Fortune put an End to the moſt extenſive Views of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and change the chearful Scene of Joy and Comfort into a melancholy State of Miſery and Deſpair! If therefore we do not pity thoſe, who are in Affliction, when we fall into it ourſelves, who will pity and relieve us? Then ſhall we remember the Afflictions of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſay as his Brethren did, when they came into Trouble; <hi>We are very guilty concerning our Brother, in that we ſaw the Anguiſh of his Soul, when he beſought us, and would not hear; therefore is this Diſtreſs come upon us.</hi> What black and obdurate Hearts muſt thoſe Men have, who can look with Indifference and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern on the Misfortunes of others? Can ſuch Men be honour'd, eſteem'd, or truſted in any of the Affairs of Life? Shall we not be always apprehenſive, that Villany and Perfidiouſneſs muſt be the Companions of Pride and Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Surely, to be inſenſible of the Miſeries of others is the next Step to rejoicing in them; and the Man, who neglects us when unhappy, would not ſcruple to make us ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0235302900:8"/>THAT the Duty I am recommending is an important and a neceſſary one, every impartial Man is, I believe, ſufficiently convinced. That it is alſo eaſy and delightful, is a Truth ſcarce leſs ſelf-evident. It is equally attainable by every Man, in every Station and Profeſſion. A Science, which requires no Superiority of Wealth, Parts, or Knowledge, to make us Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of. We have not all of us Riches to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on the Indigent; we cannot impart Health to the Sick, or reſtore Youth to the Aged; but we have all of us Eyes to look upon, Hearts to feel for and ſympathize with, Tongues to ſpeak to and comfort the Afflicted.</p>
            <p>HOW great an Averſion ſoever the gay and unthinking Part of Mankind may have to all that is grave and melancholy, it may with the greateſt Truth be aſſerted, that he, who is a Stranger to Sorrow, is a Stranger to the beſt Emotions, the nobleſt Feelings the human Heart is capable of receiving. In the Cup of Affliction there is always a Cordial thrown in by Providence to make the Draught leſs bitter, and the very Tears of Virtue adminiſter a more ſolid Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to a right Mind than Vice and Folly have Power to beſtow. There is in ſome Men a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Tenderneſs of Diſpoſition, and a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Senſation; which thoſe, whom we falſely term the Brave and Reſolute, are too often Strangers to; a Diſpoſition which, however we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0235302900:9"/>
may ſometimes ridicule and deſpiſe, is what will in the End moſt intimately unite and endear them to us: Thoſe Things, which in Health and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity may raiſe our Laughter and Contempt, in Sickneſs and Adverſity meet with our Eſteem and Approbation; and we ſeldom know the true Merit of Compaſſion, till we feel the Want of it.</p>
            <p>AS big with Ills as human Life is, yet by the Obſervance of this ſhort and important Precept of my Text, half the Miſeries of Mankind might be ſoftened or removed; for there is ſcarce a Misfortune we are liable to here, to which the Society, the Sympathy and Condolement of a ſincere Friend cannot adminiſter ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:</p>
            <p>IN Poverty: In Affliction, in Sickneſs, and in old Age.</p>
            <p>IN regard to Poverty, it muſt indeed be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd that the beſt Method of ſhewing our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to thoſe, who labour under it, is to ſupply their Neceſſities; the happy Lot of the Fortunate, whom GOD hath bleſſed with Abundance. But this is not the only Means, by which the Poor may be relieved. We may <hi>weep with them when they weep, and mourn when they mourn</hi>; and the tender Tear, ſhed by the good Man over the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and unhappy, may perhaps give him as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0235302900:10"/>
much Conſolation as that Alms, which the Proud and Unfeeling beſtows on him from Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>IN Regard to Afflictions, it may be obſerv'd; that amongſt thoſe, which daily ſurrounds us, there are ſome of ſo oppreſſive and violent a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as to ſink the Soul into a State of the deepeſt Melancholy and Deſpair. This is, for the moſt Part, the Time, when the Mind, too ſore to admit of Conſolation, will yet find ſome Relief in the Condolement of a Friend. Tho' we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heal the Wound, we may yet pour a Balm into it to mitigate the Pain; and here the Text points out the exact Method and Meaſure of our Duty. We muſt <hi>not fail to weep with them, that weep.</hi> At ſuch a Time, Wit would be odious and Mirth unſeaſonable. We are to behave in a Manner ſuitable to the Situation of thoſe we viſit; to make uſe of all the Arts, which Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip can ſuggeſt; to ſoften their Sorrows; to calm the Tempeſt of their Grief, and ſooth them if poſſible into Reſt, Reſignation and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs.</p>
            <p>IF the Sympathy and Society of a Friend can afford Comfort in Poverty and Affliction, no leſs is its Efficacy in the unavoidable Ills of Sickneſs and old Age; and I appeal to the Hearts of all who have languiſh'd under any of thoſe Diſtempers our weak Frames are ſubject to, if ever the Sight of their Friends was ſo pleaſing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0235302900:11"/>
to their Eyes, or the Voice of thoſe, they lov'd, ſo ſweet to their Ear as when they came in that melancholy Hour of Diſtreſs to viſit and relieve them.</p>
            <p>BUT if we even eſcape thoſe cruel Diſorders, that are the common Portion of Humanity (which how few do Experience will teſtify) there is, after all, the Diſeaſe of old Age to be encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd with; and in that Train of Ills, which attend, there is not perhaps a greater than that Solitude, which generally accompanies it. The old Man has ſeldom any Amuſements but his own Reflections; any conſtant Companions but his Infirmities. Even the Bonds of natural Affection and the Ties of Kindred are found too weak to hold the Impatience of Youth by the Side of Age and Imbecillity. Here then, above all, ſhould we exerciſe the Duties of Humanity and Compaſſion; to ſupport the Steps of the Feeble; to raiſe the drooping Head, and chear the afflicted Heart. Such humane and tender Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices we ſhall all, if we live, expect ourſelves. They make the Burthen of Years more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; ſmooth the Bed of Death, and teach us to reſign Life with Calmneſs and Tranquillity into the Hands of HIM that gave it.</p>
            <p>IF ever there was a Time for the Subject of my preſent Diſcourſe to demand your moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Attention; if ever the Virtues of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Compaſſion had room to exert all their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0235302900:12"/>
Power, and ſhine with diſtinguiſh'd Luſtre; it is at this remarkable and melancholy Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The very late dreadful and unforeſeen Calamity, which has ſo alarm'd and terrify'd us, and from which we are ourſelves, by the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of GOD, ſo miraculouſly deliver'd, call upon me to point out to you but too many moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, moſt unhappy Objects of your Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration. The innumerable, the almoſt irretrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Miſeries, which Scenes of this Kind are productive of, cannot be conceived, much leſs expreſs'd. I need not, I believe, exhort you to condole with, to relieve and ſupport, by all the Means in your Power, the unfortunate Sufferers. Terror and Affright have hitherto been the only Senſations they were capable of receiving. They have not yet been ſufficiently at Leiſure to feel themſelves unhappy, or found Time to count their Misfortunes. When thoſe Hours come, I truſt we ſhall not want Tears to <hi>weep with,</hi> or unfeigned Sorrow to <hi>mourn with them</hi>; and in the mean Time it highly concerns us to look nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into ourſelves. That we are now here; that we poſſeſs our Lives and Properties in Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whilſt almoſt every Thing round us lies bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Ruin and Deſolation, is a ſignal Inſtance of the Divine Mercy in our Behalf.</p>
            <p>ALL the Parts of this great Metropolis, which have eſcaped the Fury of this cruel Diſaſter, ought doubtleſs, with Hearts full of Gratitude, ſincerely to acknowledge the Hand of Providence

in their Preſervation. But it hath pleaſed GOD, that the ſmall, the fortunate Number of thoſe, to whom I now addreſs myſelf, are by a Peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Circumſtances thoſe, who, of all Men, have the moſt Reaſon to return Thanks to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD for his late Mercies vouchſafed unto them. What Praiſe and Thankſgiving, what Wonder and Adoration is not due to that gracious Being, which hath thus preſerved us; who when the devouring Flame had ſpread Miſery and Deſtruction on our Right Hand and on our Left; when there was nothing but Tears, and <hi>complaining in our Streets,</hi> and we expected every Moment to be ſwallowed up in the general Ruin, thus ſtopt it juſt at our Doors, and ſaid to the deſtructive Element, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou go, and no further!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us then <hi>ſin no more, leſt a like, or perhaps a worſe, Thing happen unto us.</hi> Let the Storm, which hath blown over us, and the Danger we have eſcaped, teach us the Things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to our Peace. Let them ſtir us up to the important Duties of our Religion. Let us apply ourſelves more earneſtly to Prayer and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. I am ſure we ſhall be, of all Men, the moſt undeſerving and ungrateful, if we do not now frequent this Houſe of GOD, when it is to his gracious Mercy alone we are ſo viſibly indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Preſervation of it. A Bleſſing our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Neighbours are deprived of; who have

not a <note n="*" place="bottom">St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s Church was ſo much damaged by the Fire as to make it impoſſible to perform Divine Service there till repaired.</note> Place of public Worſhip left, wherein to ſend up their ſad Prayers to GOD for Succour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Afflictions.</p>
            <p>To him therefore, who ſaved us when we had well nigh periſhed, let us give, as we are moſt bounden, continual Thanks; beſeeching Him to grant that this his Tenderneſs towards us, may fill us with the moſt lively Senſe of his Goodneſs, and the ſincereſt Acknowledgment of it; that we may lead a new Life, following his Commandments and walking henceforth in his Holy Ways.</p>
            <p>THAT as thou, O GOD, haſt in the Midſt of Judgment remember'd Mercy; as thou haſt ſaved <hi>our Souls from Death, our Eyes from Tears, and our Feet from falling,</hi> we may laud and magnify thy Holy Name, praiſe, bleſs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify thee, and finally that, as thy Goodneſs hath interposed to ſave us in this World, thy Mercy may preſerve us in that, which is to come; through JESUS CHRIST our LORD.</p>
