            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1083401300:3"/>But it is not enough, that the Laws of England exclude <hi>Slavery</hi> merely <hi>from this iſland,</hi> whilſt the grand Enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind triumphs in a toleration, <hi>throughout our Colonies,</hi> of the moſt monſtrous <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> to which human nature can be ſubjected!</p>
                  <p>And yet this abominable wickedneſs has not wanted advocates, who, in a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of late publications, have attempted to palliate the guilt, and have even ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to appeal to Scripture for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their uncharitable pretenſions: ſo that I am laid under a double obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to anſwer them, becauſe it is not the cauſe of <hi>Liberty</hi> alone for which I now contend, but for that which I have ſtill much more at heart, the honour of the holy Scriptures, the principles of which are entirely oppoſite to the ſelfiſh and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1083401300:4"/>uncharitable pretenſions of our American Slaveholders and African Traders.</p>
                  <p>A late anonymous writer, who calls himſelf <hi>"An African Merchant,"</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, that,—<q>By the Law of Moſes, the Iſraelites might purchaſe Slaves from the Heathens, and even their own people might become Slaves to their brethren.</q>

                  <p>Now, with reſpect to the firſt part of his obſervation, it is true, indeed, that the Iſraelites were expreſſly permitted to keep Bond-Servants, or Slaves, <q>of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> (or, more properly, of the <hi>Nations</hi>

                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Exod. xxxiv. 11 and 12.</note>, and

                     <note n="4" place="bottom">(4) <q>And thou ſhalt conſume all the people which the Lord thy God ſhall deliver thee: thine eye ſhall have <hi>no pity upon them,</hi>

                  <p>But no doctrine muſt be drawn from theſe commands to <hi>execute God's vengeance</hi> upon the ſaid wicked <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> without conſidering, at the ſame time, <hi>that very contrary treatment of ſtrangers</hi> which was <hi>equally</hi> enjoined in the Law: for the Iſraelites were poſitively commanded not to <hi>vex</hi> or <hi>oppreſs a Stranger.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>Thou
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1083401300:7"/>ſhalt love him as thyſelf,</hi>
                     </q> ſaid Moſes, by the expreſs command of God. <q>If a Stranger ſojourn with thee in your land, ye <hi>ſhall not vex</hi>
                     </q> (or <hi>oppreſs</hi>) <q>him. But <hi>the Stranger</hi> that dwelleth with you ſhall be unto you as one born among you, and <hi>thou ſhalt love him as thyſelf:</hi> for ye were <hi>Strangers</hi> in the land of Egypt.</q> Levit. xix. 33.34. And again: <q>The Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty and a terrible, which <hi>regardeth not perſons</hi> nor taketh reward: he doth execute the judgement of the fatherleſs and widow, and <hi>loveth the Stranger,</hi> in giving him food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Love ye,</hi> therefore, <hi>the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> for ye <hi>were Strangers</hi> in the land of Egypt.</q> Deut. x. 17 to 19. In all theſe paſſages, and many others, the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites were reminded of their <hi>Bondage in Egypt:</hi> for ſo the almighty <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer</hi> from <hi>Slavery</hi> warned his people
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1083401300:8"/>to <hi>limit</hi> and moderate the <hi>bondage,</hi> which the Law permitted, by the remembrance of <hi>their own former bondage</hi> in a foreign land, and by a remembrance alſo of his great mercy <hi>in delivering them</hi> from that <hi>bondage:</hi> and he expreſſly referred them to <hi>their own feelings,</hi> as they themſelves had experienced the intolerable yoke of Egyptian Tyranny! <q>Thou ſhalt not <hi>oppreſs a Stranger;</hi> for ye know the heart of <hi>a ſtranger,</hi> ſeeing ye were <hi>ſtrangers</hi> in the land of Egypt.</q> Exod. xxiii. 9. And again: <q>Thou ſhalt remember that <hi>thou</hi> waſt <hi>a Bond-man</hi> in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God <hi>redeemed thee:</hi>
                     </q> Deut. xv. 15.</p>
                  <p>We muſt, therefore, neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, when theſe very oppoſite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are conſidered, that the <hi>Heathen,</hi> or <hi>nations</hi> that were "ROUND ABOUT," or in the <hi>environs</hi> of the promiſed land, and alſo the <hi>children of the ſtrangers,</hi> that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1083401300:9"/>dwelt among them, mentioned at the ſame time, whom the Iſraelites were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to retain <hi>in perpetual bondage,</hi> were not intended to be included and ranked under that general denomination of <hi>Strangers,</hi> to whom ſo much real <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, benevolence,</hi> and <hi>conſideration,</hi> are ſtrictly commanded, in the texts to which I have juſt now referred. And, conſequently, it muſt be allowed, that the particular nations, (the ſeven nations of Paleſtine, ſee Deut. vii. 1.) which were expreſſly devoted to deſtruction, were the only <hi>Strangers</hi> whom the Jews were permitted to hold in <hi>abſolute Slavery;</hi> ſo that the wicked practice of <hi>enſlaving</hi> the poor <hi>African Negroes</hi> would have been as <hi>unlawful,</hi> under the Jewiſh Diſpenſation, as it certainly is, now a-days, to Engliſhmen, and other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Great-Britain, that profeſs <hi>the Chriſtian Religion; in whoſe conſideration,</hi> ALL STRANGERS, from every
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1083401300:10"/>other part of the world, are, without doubt, entitled to be ranked, eſteemed, and beloved, <hi>as brethren,</hi> which I have elſewhere particularly demonſtrated; and which even the law of Moſes expreſſly commanded: — <q>But <hi>the ſtranger,</hi> that dwelleth with you, ſhall be unto you <hi>as one born among you,</hi> and THOU SHALT LOVE HIM AS THY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF; for <hi>ye were ſtrangers</hi> in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.</q> Levit. xix. 33 and 34.</p>
                  <p>This excellent ſyſtem of benevolence to <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> which the Iſraelites were ſo ſtrictly enjoined to obſerve, cannot, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, be otherwiſe reconciled with the permiſſion to the Iſraelites of retaining in perpetual bondage <hi>the heathen that were round about them,</hi> and the children of <hi>the ſtrangers</hi> that ſojourned among them: for, if this permiſſion were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>ſtrangers in general,</hi> it would
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1083401300:11"/>ſubvert the expreſs command concerning <hi>brotherly love</hi> due to <hi>ſtrangers;</hi> becauſe a man cannot be ſaid <hi>to love the ſtranger as himſelf</hi> if he holds <hi>the ſtranger</hi> and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny in a perpetual <hi>involuntary ſervitude.</hi> The obſervation therefore of the African Merchant, that <q>THE ISRAELITES <hi>might purchaſe Slaves from the heathens,</hi>
                     </q> will by no means juſtify the <hi>enſlaving</hi> of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern heathens,</hi> by <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> or by any other nation now ſubſiſting. The Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, at that time, might not only purchaſe Slaves of thoſe particular heathen nations, but they might alſo <hi>drive out theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;</hi> (I mean, theſe which were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly named;) nay, even <hi>kill</hi>

                        </q> Deut. xx. 16.</note> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate</hi> them, and <hi>take poſſeſſion of their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, houſes,</hi> and <hi>lands.</hi> All theſe acts of violence <hi>might</hi> the Iſraelites do <hi>without ſin,</hi> though the like would juſtly be eſteemed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1083401300:12"/>
                     <hi>murder</hi> and <hi>robbery,</hi> if practiſed by any other nation, not under the like peculiar circumſtances: ſo that the example of the Iſraelites affords no excuſe for the uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable practices of the <hi>African Merchant</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India Planter!</hi> The Iſraelites had an expreſs commiſſion
<note n="6" place="bottom">

                        <p>(27) The alarming increaſe of infidelity, and the open declarations of Deiſts, Arians, Socinians, and others, who deny the Divinity of Chriſt, and of the Holy Ghoſt, are lamentable proofs of the growing apoſtacy! The African Church fell away by degrees in the ſame manner, till it was totally loſt in the moſt barbarous ignorance, (except in Habeſſinia) for even thoſe Africans who are free from idolatry, and profeſs to worſhip <hi>the true God,</hi> are, nevertheleſs, enſnared and enſlaved in the groſs errors of <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> to which a neglect of the neceſſary Faith in the <hi>Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> has an apparent tendency! We have likewiſe a remarkable inſtance of <hi>infidelity,</hi> or at leaſt of a total neglect of Scripture authority and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, in the attempt of two late writers to prove that Negroes are <hi>"an inferior ſpecies of men:"</hi> but the learned Dr. <hi>Beattie,</hi> in his <hi>Eſſay on Truth,</hi> has fully refuted the inſinuations of Mr. <hi>Hume,</hi> the firſt broacher of that uncharitable doctrine, as well as Ariſtotle's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile attempt to juſtify <hi>ſlavery;</hi> ſo that Mr. <hi>Eſtwick</hi>'s ſubſequent attempt, which was prompted only by the authority of Mr. <hi>Hume,</hi> needs no further confutation. <q>That I may not be thought a blind admirer of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, (ſays Dr. Beattie) I would here crave the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's indulgence for one ſhort digreſſion more, in order to put him in mind of an important error in morals, inferred from partial and inaccurate experience, by no leſs a perſon than Ariſtotle himſelf. He ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, 'That men of little genius, and great bodily <hi>ſtrength, are by nature deſtined to ſerve,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>better capacity to command;</hi> and that the natives of Greece, and of ſome other countries, being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuperior in genius, have <hi>a natural right to</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and that the reſt of mankind, being <hi>naturally ſtupid,</hi> are deſtined to <hi>labour and ſlavery,</hi>' (De Republ. lib. 1. cap. 5, 6.) This reaſoning is now, alas! of little advantage <hi>to Ariſtotle's countrymen, who have for many ages been doomed to that ſlavery,</hi> which, <hi>in his</hi> judgment, <hi>nature had deſtined them to impoſe on others;</hi> and many nations whom he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned <hi>to everlaſting ſtupidity,</hi> have ſhown themſelves <hi>equal</hi> in genius to the moſt <hi>exalted of human kind.</hi> It would have been more worthy of Ariſtotle, to have inferred man's natural and univerſal right to liberty, from that natural and univerſal paſſion with which men deſire it. He wanted, perhaps, to <hi>deviſe ſome excuſe for ſervitude;</hi> a practice which, to <hi>their eternal reproach,</hi> both Greeks and Romans tolerated even in the days of their glory.</q>

                           <q>Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> argues nearly in the ſame manner in regard to the ſuperiority of white men over black. 'I am apt to ſuſpect,' ſays he, 'the negroes, and in general all the other ſpecies of men, (for there are four or five different kinds) to be naturally inferior to the whites. There <hi>never was</hi> a civilized nation of any other complexion than white, <hi>nor even any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual</hi> eminent either in action or ſpeculation. <hi>No</hi> ingenious manufactures among them, <hi>no</hi> arts, <hi>no</hi> ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.—There are negro ſlaves diſperſed all over Europe, of which <hi>none</hi> ever diſcovered any ſymptoms of ingenuity.' (Hume's Eſſay on National Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.)—Theſe aſſertions are ſtrong; but I know not whether they have any thing elſe to recommend them. For, firſt, though true, they would <hi>not prove the point in queſtion,</hi> except it were alſo proved, that the Africans and Americans, even though arts and ſciences were introduced among them, would ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unſuſceptible of cultivation. The <hi>inhabitants of Great Britain and France were as ſavage two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ago,</hi> as thoſe <hi>of Africa and America are at this day.</hi> To civilize a nation, is a work which it requires long time to accompliſh. And one may as <hi>well ſay of an infant, that he can never become a man, as of a nation now barbarous, that it never can be civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized.</hi> Secondly, of the facts here aſſerted, <hi>no man could have ſufficient evidence, except from a perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with all the negroes that now are, or ever were, on the face of the earth.</hi> Thoſe people write no hiſtories; and all the reports of all the travellers that ever viſited them, will not amount to any thing like a proof of what is here affirmed. BUT, THIRD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY, WE KNOW THAT THESE ASSERTIONS ARE NOT TRUE. The empires of Peru and Mexico could not have been governed, nor the metropolis of the latter built after ſo ſingular a manner, in the middle of a lake, <hi>without men eminent both for action and ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Every body has heard of the magnificence, good government, and ingenuity, of the ancient Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvians. <hi>The Africans and Americans are known to have many ingenious manufactures and arts among them, which even Europeans</hi> would find it no eaſy matter <hi>to imitate.</hi> Sciences indeed they have none, becauſe they have no letters; but in oratory, ſome of them, particularly the Indians <hi>of the Five Nations,</hi> are ſaid to be greatly our ſuperiors. It will be readily allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the condition of a ſlave is not favourable to genius of any kind; and yet, <hi>the negro ſlaves diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over Europe,</hi> have <hi>often diſcovered ſymptoms of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, notwithſtanding their unhappy circumſtances.</hi> They <hi>become excellent handicraftſmen, and practical muſicians,</hi> and indeed learn every thing their maſters are at pains to teach them, perfidy and debauchery not excepted. That a negro ſlave, who can neither read nor write, nor ſpeak any European language, who is not permitted to do any thing but what his maſter commands, and who has not a ſingle friend on earth, but is univerſally conſidered and treated as if he were of a ſpecies inferior to the human;—that ſuch a creature ſhould ſo diſtinſtuiſh himſelf among Europeans, as to be talked of through the world for a man of genius, is ſurely no reaſonable expectation. To ſuppoſe him of an inferior ſpecies, becauſe he does not thus diſtinguiſh himſelf, is juſt as rational, as to ſuppoſe any private European of an inferior ſpecies, becauſe he has not raiſed himſelf to the condition of royalty.</q>

                           <q>Had the Europeans been deſtitute of the arts of writing, and working in iron, they might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to this day as barbarous as the natives of Africa and America. Nor is the invention of theſe arts to be aſcribed to our ſuperior capacity. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the inventor is not always to be eſtimated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the importance of the invention. Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, and the mariner's compaſs, have produced wonderful revolutions in human affairs, and yet were accidental diſcoveries. Such, probably, were the firſt eſſays in writing, and working in iron. Suppoſe them the effects of contrivance; they were at leaſt contrived by a few individuals; and if they required a ſuperiority of underſtanding, or of ſpecies in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors, thoſe inventors, and their deſcendents, are the only perſons who can lay claim to the honour of that ſuperiority.</q>

                           <q>That every practice and ſentiment is barbarous which is not according to the uſages of modern Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, ſeems to be a fundamental maxim with many of our critics and philoſophers. Their remarks often put us in mind of the fable of the man and the lion. If negroes and Indians were diſpoſed to recriminate; if a Lucian or a Voltaire from the coaſt of Guinea, or from <hi>the Five Nations,</hi> were to pay us a viſit; what a picture of European manners might he preſent to his countrymen at his return! Nor would carica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, or exaggeration, be neceſſary to render it hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous. <hi>A plain hiſtorical account of ſome of our moſt faſhionable duelliſts, gamblers, and adulterers,</hi> (to name no more) would exhibit <hi>ſpecimens of brutiſh barbarity and ſottiſh infatuation,</hi> ſuch as might vie with any that ever appeared in Kamſchatka, California, or the land of Hottentots.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>IT was deſigned to confute a piece wrote by Thomas Thompſon, M. A. ſome time fellow of C. C. C. entitled,</q> 
                        <q>The Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can trade for Negro Slaves ſhewn to be conſiſtent with principles of humanity, and with the laws of revealed religion.</q> 'Printed at Canterbury.'</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>IN order to ſhew that the Eſſay Writer has not miſrepreſented the text, nor is ſingle in his obſervations upon it, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the Monthly Reviewers on that pamphlet in May, 1772, are here inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"We muſt acknowledge," ſay they, <q>that the branch of trade here under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1083401300:71"/>is a ſpecies of traffic which we have never been able to reconcile with the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of humanity, and much leſs with thoſe of religion. The principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in its behalf ſeems to be, the <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> of ſuch a reſcource, in order to carry on the works in our plantations, which, we are told, it is otherwiſe impoſſible to perform. But this, though the urgency of the caſe may be very great, is not by any means ſufficient to juſtify the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. There is a farther conſideration which has a plauſible appearance, and may be thought to carry ſome weight; it is, that the merchant only purchaſes thoſe who were ſlaves before, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may, rather than otherwiſe, render their lituation more tolerable. But it is well known, that the lot of our Slaves, when moſt favourably conſidered, is very hard and miſerable; beſides which, ſuch a trade is taking the advantage of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and brutality of unenlightened na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who are encouraged to war with each other for this very purpoſe, and, it is to be feared, are ſometimes tempted to ſeize thoſe of their own tribes or families that they may obtain the hoped for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: and it is owned, with regard to our merchants, that, upon occaſion, they obſerve the like practices, which are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1083401300:72"/>thought to be allowable, becauſe they are done by way of repriſal for theft or damage committed by the natives. We were pleaſed, however, to meet with a pamphlet on the other ſide of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and we entered upon its peruſal with the hopes of finding ſomewhat ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced which might afford us ſatisfaction on this difficult point. The writer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a ſenſible man, and capable of diſcuſſing the argument; but the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to which he is confined, rendered his performance rather ſuperficial. The plea he produces from the Jewiſh law is not, in our view of the matter, at all concluſive. The people of Iſrael were under a <hi>theocracy,</hi> in which the Supreme Being was in a peculiar ſenſe their King, and might therefore iſſue forth ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for them, which it would not be warrantable for another people, who were in different circumſtances, to obſerve. Such, for inſtance, was the command given concerning the extirpation of the Canaanites, whom, the ſovereign Arbiter of life and death might, if he had pleaſed, have deſtroyed by plague or famine, or other of thoſe means which we term na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſes, and by which a wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence fulfils its own purpoſes. But it would be unreaſonable to infer from the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1083401300:73"/>manner in which the Iſraelites dealt with the people of Canaan, that any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have a right to purſue the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Neither can we imagine that St. Paul's exhortation to ſervants or ſlaves, upon their converſion, to continue in the ſtate in which chriſtianity found them, affords any argument favourable to the practice here pleaded for. It is no more than ſaying, that Chriſtianity did not particularly enter into the regulations of civil ſociety at that time; that it taught perſons to be contented and diligent in their ſtations: but certainly it did not forbid them, in a proper and lawful way, if it was in their power, to render their circumſtances more comfortable. Upon the whole, we muſt own, that this little treatiſe is not convincing to us, though, as different perſons are differently affected by the ſame conſiderations, it may prove more ſatisfactory to others.</q>

                     <p>'IN another place they obſerve,' <q>ſince we are <hi>all brethren,</hi> and God has given to <hi>all</hi> men a natural right to <hi>Liberty,</hi> we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of no <hi>Slavery</hi> among us, unleſs a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon forfeits his freedom by his crimes.</q>

                        <q>THAT Slavery is not conſiſtent with the Engliſh conſtitution, nor admiſſable in Great Britain, appears evidently by the late ſolemn determination, in the court of

Let us never forget, that an equal if not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proportion of our own colour behave worſe with all the advantages of birth, education and circumſtances; and we ſhall bluſh to oppoſe an equitable emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, by this or the like arguments.</q>

There can be but one beatific point of rectitude, but many paths leading to it, in which perſons differing in modes and non-eſſentials, may walk with freedom to their own opinions; we may much more innocently be under a miſtake, than continue in it after a hint given, which occaſions our adverting thereto; for it ſeems a duty to inveſtigate the way of

                        <q>THE mode of manumitting negroes in New-Jerſey is ſuch as appears terrific, and amounts almoſt to a prohibition, becauſe of its incumbering conſequences, which few prudent people chuſe to leave their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies liable to. It is much eaſier in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other colonies. In Pennſylvania a recognizance entered into in THIRTY POUNDS to indemnify the townſhip, is a compleat diſcharge. In Mariland; where Negroes are ſo numerous, I am informed, the maſter or miſtreſs may at pleaſure give Liberty to their ſlaves without the leaſt obligation, and be clear of any future burden. Both theſe are exceptionable, and may be improved. Proper diſtinctions are neceſſary; for as the freedom of all gratis might be unjuſt, not only to the publick but the Slave: ſo any clog upon the owner who gives up his right at an age when he cannot have received much or any advantage from the labour of the

                     <p>THE reverend Mr. Thompſon's <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are not true,</hi> for the Jewiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions <hi>were not "ſtrictly conſiſtent"</hi> with the <hi>law of nature</hi> in all points, as he ſuppoſes, and conſequently his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>concluſion</hi> thereupon is erroneous. Many things were formerly tolerated among the Iſraelites, merely through
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1083401300:87"/>the mercy and forbearance of God, in conſideration of their extreme frailty and inability, at that time, to bear a more perfect ſyſtem of law. Other laws there are in the five books (beſides the ceremonial laws now abrogated) which are merely <hi>municipal,</hi> being adapted to the peculiar polity of the Iſraelitiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, on account of its ſituation in the midſt of the moſt barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whom the Hebrews were at all times but too much inclined to immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>
                     <p>THE univerſal <hi>moral laws</hi> and thoſe of <hi>natural equity</hi> are, indeed, every where plentifully interſperſed among the <hi>peculiar laws</hi> abovementioned; but they may very eaſily be diſtinguiſhed by every ſincere Chriſtian, who examines them with <hi>a liberal mind,</hi> becauſe the <hi>benevolent purpoſe</hi> of the Divine Author
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1083401300:88"/>is <hi>always apparent</hi> in thoſe laws which are to be <hi>eternally binding;</hi> for <q>it is <hi>the reaſon</hi> of the law which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the <hi>life of the law,</hi>
                        </q> according to an allowed maxim of our own country, "Ratio Legis eſt anima Legis," (Jenk. Cent. 45.) And with reſpect to theſe <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>equitable</hi> laws, I will readily agree with the Reverend Mr. Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they are the beſt rule by which <q>learned judges and caſuiſts can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what is, or is not, <hi>contrary to nature.</hi>

                     <p>BUT I will now give a few examples of laws, which are in <hi>themſelves contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to nature or natural equity,</hi> in order to ſhew that Mr. Thompſon's <hi>premiſes</hi> are totally falſe:</p>
                     <p>THE Iſraelites were expreſsly <hi>permitted by the law of Moſes</hi> to give a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1083401300:89"/>to their wives whenever they pleaſed, and to marry <hi>other women;</hi> and the women who were put away, were alſo expreſsly permitted, by the Moſaic law, <hi>to marry again,</hi> during the lives of their for mer huſbands.</p>
                     <p>ALL which practices were manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to <hi>the law of nature</hi> in its purity, though not perhaps to <hi>the nature of our corrupt affections and deſires;</hi> for Chriſt himſelf declared, that <q>

One common puniſhment, is to flea their backs with cow hides, or other inſtruments of barbarity, and then pour on hot rum, ſuperinduced with brine or pickle, rub'd in with a corn huſk, in the ſcorching heat of the Sun. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if your judges were ſenſible of the ſhocking treatment of the convicts here, they would hang every one of them, as an infinitely leſs puniſhment, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port only thoſe, whoſe crimes deſerve the ſevereſt death.

                     <p>
                        <q>I Have conceived a very high opinion of your abilities, by peruſing your learned account of <hi>Egypt, and the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd Kings,</hi> &amp;c. and as you ſeem to have ſtudied, very particularly, the hiſtory of the <hi>Cuſeans</hi> and antient <hi>Arabians,</hi> you can (I apprehend) eaſily reſolve ſome doubts, relating thereto, which occurred to me on reading your book.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I HAD always ſuppoſed that black men in general were deſcended from <hi>Cuſh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a diſtinction in colour from the reſt of mankind, ſeems to have been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly attributed to his deſcendants, <hi>the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhim,</hi> even to a proverb.</q> 
                        <q>
                           <hi>Can the Cuſhi</hi> (commonly rendered Ethiopian) <hi>change his Skin,</hi>
                        </q> &amp;c. (Jeremiah, xiii. 23.) and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1083401300:112"/>
                        <q>therefore I concluded that all negroes as well <hi>Eaſt Indian</hi> as <hi>African,</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the general name of <hi>Cuſhim,</hi> as being, probably, deſcended from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent branches of the ſame ſtock, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the proverb is equally applicable to both, with reſpect to their complection, tho' in many reſpects they are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. But in p. 254, of your learned work, where you are ſpeaking of the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeans</hi> in general, you ſay, that they are <q>to be found within the tropics, almoſt as low as the Gold coaſt,</q> &amp;c. as if you apprehended, that the negroes on the Gold coaſt, and below it, <hi>were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from Cuſh.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <q>Now, Sir, I ſhall think myſelf greatly obliged, if you will be pleaſed to inform me, whether you really have any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſon to apprehend that the negroes on the coaſt of <hi>Guinea</hi> (from whence our plantations are moſt commonly ſupplied) are deſcended from any other ſtock? Or whether their deſcent can at all be traced?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I AM far from having any particular eſteem for the negroes, but as I think myſelf <hi>obliged</hi> to conſider them as <hi>Men,</hi> I am certainly <hi>obliged,</hi> alſo, to uſe my beſt endeavours to prevent their being treated <hi>as beaſts,</hi> by our unchriſtian countrymen, who deny them the privileges of <hi>human Nature;</hi> and, in order to excuſe their

                     <p>
                        <q>I MOST ſincerely wiſh you ſucceſs in your laudable purpoſe: and am very glad to find in theſe baſe times, that there is a perſon, who will ſtand up in defence of human nature; and not ſuffer it to be limited to a ſet of features and complexion. There is nothing, I believe, in my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that can affect any argument, which you may think proper to urge in favour of thoſe, whom you would patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize. But to take away all embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and uncertainty, I will give you my opinion upon the ſubject, which you have ſtated to me in your letter, in reſpect to the origin of the Nigritae or Negroes. You ſeem to think, that all, who are of that very deep tint, which is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1083401300:115"/>obſervable in the natives upon the coaſt of Guinea, are the offspring of <hi>Chus:</hi> and all black men in general are of the ſame origin.

Suppoſe alſo that the landholders,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1083401300:125"/>who do not occupy all their grounds, were adviſed to divide what lands they can ſpare into <hi>compact little farms,</hi> with a ſmall wooden cottage to each, which ſhould be allotted to thoſe negroes only, who are natives of the colony, or elſe have been ſo long in it, that their diſpoſitions are ſufficiently known, whether or not they may ſafely be entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their liberty. Let ſuch negroes hold theſe ſmall portions of land by leaſes, for a certain term of years; and at equitable rents, to be paid in ſuch portions of <hi>the produce</hi> from time to time, as ſhall be thought moſt reaſonable, leaving the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants a moderate gain, (beſides their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſubſiſtence) to encourage induſtry, and yet ſo as to yield the landlords a due profit from each portion of their eſtates, beſides an adequate allowance to reimburſe (within the limited time) not only the regiſtered price of their quondam ſlaves, but alſo whatever ſums they may have advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the expence of <hi>building,</hi> of <hi>implements,</hi> of <hi>live ſtock,</hi> of <hi>ſeed, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> the amount of which ought to be added to the firſt debt and regiſtered, in like manner, before the leaſes are executed. By theſe means the landlords will loſe nothing of their wealth, and yet the moſt uſeful and worthieſt of the negroes will acquire a <hi>natural intereſt</hi> in the welfare and ſafety of the community, which will inſure their aſſiſtance againſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1083401300:126"/>any hoſtile attempt of the reſt. Other negroes, that are not capable of managing and ſhifting for themſelves, nor are fit to be truſted, all at once, with liberty, might be delivered over to the care and protection of a county committee, in order to avoid the baneful effects of <hi>private property in men;</hi> and might, by the ſaid committee, be let out, as <hi>hired ſervants,</hi> to ſuch perſons as would undertake the charge of them, to be paid (alſo <hi>in produce</hi>) towards the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the regiſtered debt for each man's original price; and the labourer himſelf in the mean while to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one day in a week (beſide the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day) for his own profit, or be paid for it according to the mode of the <hi>Spaniſh regulations,</hi> (which I before tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) that he may have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to acquire a little property of his own, which will <hi>prepare his mind,</hi> as well as his circumſtances <hi>for freedom,</hi> by enabling him, as a member of the community to ſhift for himſelf at the time of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. By ſome ſuch regulations, as theſe, ſlavery might be changed into a condition, more nearly reſembling that of <hi>hired ſervants,</hi> as no maſter would be the <hi>abſolute proprietor</hi> of thoſe he employs, and yet all reaſonable advantages ariſing from their labour, would remain; which muſt occaſion a reciprocal improvement in the morality and humanity both of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

In the mean while, the hours of labour ſhould be uniformly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, to prevent the oppreſſion of avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious exactors, and the danger of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: and ſchools ſhould be opened in every diſtrict, to give the poor labourers and their children, ſome general ideas of morality and religious knowledge, which conſtitute the moſt effectual <hi>bond of peace.</hi> Theſe regulations I mention only by way of hint: you have the ſame earneſt regard

                     </p>
                     <p>Page 13.—<q>Yet ſomething, out of worldly prudence ought to be done;—for, as this evil has been violently introduced, contrary to the natural courſe of things and the conſtitution of the world, it will one day find a remedy even in its exceſs. Matters will be fatally brought to a criſis, and nature will vindicate her own laws,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1083401300:130"/>and reſtore the credit of her equal and juſt adminiſtration, to the laſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who abuſed it. THIS WILL BE WHEN THE BLACKS OF THE SOUTH-THERN COLONIES ON THE CONTINENT OF AMERICA SHALL BE NUMEROUS ENOUGH TO THROW OFF AT ONCE THE YOKE OF TYRANNY TO REVENGE THEIR WRONGS IN THE BLOOD OF THEIR OP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRESSORS, AND CARRY TERROR AND DESTRUCTION TO THE MORE NORTHERN SETTLEMENTS. Such a revolution can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take place in the iſlands until this period, on account of the want of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and communication between the ſlaves of one iſland and another and of the eaſy communication and mutual aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of whites. But an inſurrection on the continent, once communicated, will be an incitement in the iſlands, and a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for a general and (but that every Engliſhman is alike concerned, and the planter not peculiarly criminal) A MERIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED CARNAGE.</q>

                        <q>Nothing can be conceived MORE DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRUCTIVE, MORE INSATIATE, THAN THE WARS WHICH WILL FOLLOW THIS EVENT; they will be every where marked with THE MOST HORRIBLE CRUELTIES, and THE MOST FURIOUS REVENGE. The diſtinction of <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> which we
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1083401300:131"/>have ſo unreaſonably made the marks of <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>ſlavery,</hi> will then become the obvious colours of mutual hoſtility and revenge; and it ſeems likely that theſe wars MAY END TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE WHITES; becauſe the blacks, as will be preſently obſerved, will increaſe faſter, and becauſe their nature ſeems better able to bear the ſeverity of cold, than the whites can that of heat.</q>—<hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>ON Monday the 22d June, in Trinity term, 1772, the court of <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench,</hi> proceeded to give judgement in the Caſe of <hi>Somerſet</hi> and <hi>Knowles,</hi> upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Habeas Corpus.

                        <q>WE pay due attention to the opinion of Sir <hi>Philip Yorke</hi> and Mr. <hi>Talbot,</hi> in the year 1729, by which they pledged themſelves to the Britiſh planters for the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1083401300:133"/>legal conſequences of bringing Negroe-ſlaves into this kingdom, or their being baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which opinion was repeated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized by lord Hardwicke, ſitting as chancellor, on the 19th of October, 1749, to the following effect: he ſaid,</q> 
                        <q>that trover would lay for a negroe-ſlave: that a notion prevailed, that if a ſlave came into England, or became a Chriſtian, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by became emancipated; but there was no foundation in law for ſuch a notion: that when he and Lord Talbot were attorney and ſolicitor general, this notion of a ſlave becoming free by being baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo ſtrongly, that the planters induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly prevented their becoming chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: upon which their opinion was taken; <hi>and upon their beſt conſideration they were both clearly of opinion,</hi> that a ſlave did not in the leaſt alter his ſituation or ſtate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his maſter or <hi>owner,</hi> either by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chriſtened, or coming to England: that though the ſtatute of Charles II. had aboliſhed</q> (<hi>homage</hi>

                           </q> wherein this word <hi>"homage"</hi> is inſerted.</note>) <q>tenure ſo far, that no man could be a <hi>Villein regardant;</hi> yet if he would acknowledge himſelf a <hi>Villein</hi> engroſſed in any court of record, he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1083401300:134"/>knew of no way by which he could be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to his freedom, without the conſent of his maſter.</q> 
                        <q>We feel the force of the inconveniences and conſequences that will follow the deciſion of this queſtion: yet all of us are ſo clearly of one opinion upon the <hi>only</hi> queſtion before us, that we think we ought to give judgment without adjourning the matter to be argued before all the judges, as uſual in the habeas cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, and as we at firſt intimated an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doing in this caſe. The only queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then is, <hi>Is the cauſe returned ſufficient for the remanding him? If not,</hi> he muſt be diſcharged. The cauſe returned is, the <hi>ſlave</hi> abſented himſelf and departed from his maſter's ſervice, and refuſed to return and ſerve him during his ſtay in <hi>England;</hi> whereupon, by his maſter's orders, he was put on board the ſhip by force, and there detained in ſecure cuſtody, to be carried out of the kingdom and ſold. So high an act of dominion muſt derive its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if any ſuch it has, from the law of the kingdom <hi>where</hi> executed. A foreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cannot be impriſoned <hi>here</hi> on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of any law exiſting in his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The power of a maſter over his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is different in all countries, more or leſs limited or extenſive, the exerciſe of of it therefore muſt always be regulated
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1083401300:135"/>by the laws of the place where exerciſed. The ſtate of ſlavery is of ſuch a nature, that it is incapable of being now intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by courts of juſtice upon mere rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, or inferences from any principles natural or political; it muſt take its riſe from <hi>poſitive law;</hi> the origin of it can in no country or age be traced back to any other ſource. Immemorial uſage preſerves the memory of <hi>poſitive law</hi> long after all traces of the occaſion, reaſon, authority, and time of its introduction, are loſt, and in A CASE SO ODIOUS AS THE CONDITION OF SLAVES MUST BE TAKEN STRICTLY. <hi>(Tracing the ſubject to natural princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the claim of ſlavery never can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.)</hi>
                           <note n="‡" place="bottom">(‡) Theſe additions in Italics between hooks before and after the words "THE POWER CLAIMED BY THIS RETURN WAS NEVER IN USE HERE," are taken from the notes of a very ingenious and able counſellor, who was preſent when the judgement was given.—The reſt of his notes ſufficiently agree in ſubſtance with what Mr. <hi>Eſtwick</hi> has printed.</note> THE POWER CLAIMED BY THIS RETURN WAS NEVER IN USE HERE: (or <hi>acknowledged by the law.</hi>) No maſter ever was allowed here to take a ſlave by force to be ſold abroad becauſe he had deſerted from his ſervice, or for any other reaſon whatever; WE CANNOT SAY, <hi>the cauſe ſet forth by this return</hi> IS ALLOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1083401300:136"/>OR APPROVED OF BY THE LAWS OF THIS KINGDOM, and therefore the man muſt be diſcharged.</q>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1083401300:137"/>ſuch oppoſite ſentiments, ſeems as far as ever from being eſtabliſhed upon the ſolid ground of abſolute</hi> PRECISION. <hi>The planters of courſe have been left</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as much puzzled by this</hi> DELPHIC AMBIGUITY, <hi>as the ſages themſelves appear to have been, in forming their judgements upon the ſubject. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having been</hi> CONFOUNDED <hi>in this</hi> GRAND UNCERTAINTY,</q> &amp;c. (p. 57.) But theſe heavy charges of the want of "PRECISION," of "DELPHIC AMBIGUITY," and of being <q>CONFOUNDED in GRAND UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CERTAINTY,</q> &amp;c. are ſo far from being "CANDID REFLECTIONS," (as this author would have us believe them,) that even <hi>his own evidence</hi> on the proceeding page, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves the falſehood and injuſtice of this cenſures; for he has there given us the EFFECT of that late judgment of the court of King's Bench, in THE CLEAREST TERMS, without the leaſt <hi>doubt</hi> or <hi>difficulty;</hi> ſo that the <hi>delphic ambiguity,</hi> of which he <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after</hi> complains, muſt be (even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own evidence,) a mere <hi>calumny!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After reciting the opinion of lord chief juſtice <hi>Holt,</hi> he immediately adds as follows.</p>

                     <p>LORD <hi>Mansfield</hi> pronounced the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or judgment <hi>of the whole bench,</hi> and therefore if any thing was wrong, the blame ought not to reſt on him alone; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, if we fairly examine what was ſaid, we ſhall find no room for blame or cavil, His lordſhip ſaid, <q>WE <hi>pay due attention</hi> to the opinion of Sir <hi>Philip York</hi> and Mr. <hi>Talbot,</hi> in the year 1729,</q>

                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:1083401300:140"/>Now the purport of that opinion was, that the maſter <q>
                           <hi>may legally compel</hi> his ſlave <hi>to return to the plantations.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>LORD <hi>Mansfield</hi> modeſtly declined giving a direct contradiction, in expreſs words, to the opinion of two ſuch very eminent and learned lawyers; but choſe rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, tacitly, by <hi>the effect</hi> of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he was about to pronounce; and therefore he merely recited the opinion without the leaſt comment, and proceeded to the determination of the court upon the caſe before them; which is clear and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertible with reſpect to the main point of the queſtion, viz. the power claimed by the maſter, of carrying away his ſlave by force.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>The power claimed by this return,</hi> (ſaid the chief juſtice) <hi>was never in uſe here, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the law.</hi>
                        </q> Now it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the duty of the court to give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to <hi>the known laws,</hi> and not to be influenced by <hi>any opinion</hi> whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>THEY acknowledged, indeed, the having <hi>"paid due attention"</hi> to the ſaid opinion; but as their determination was diametrically oppoſite to the aſſertions in that opinion, it is manifeſt, that the court <hi>did not think it grounded in law,</hi> according to which alone they were bound to determine. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of lord <hi>Mansfield</hi>'s ſpeech contains
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1083401300:141"/>more ſubſtantial and unanſwerable reaſons for the judgment he was about to give, than the generality of his hearers, perhaps, were aware of; for he very ingeniouſly expreſſed in the ſmall compaſs of two ſhort ſentences, that the maſters claim was contrary to three principal foundations of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> law, viz. NATURE, USE, (or <hi>Cuſtom,</hi>) and the WRITTEN LAW; which laſt alſo includes two other foundations, viz. MAXIMS and STATUTES. With reſpect to the firſt, he ſaid —<q>
                           <hi>traceing the ſubject to</hi> NATURAL <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the claim of</hi> SLAVERY <hi>never can be ſupported.</hi>

And the propriety of the ſaid judgment has very lately been ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed by a decree alſo in THE HIGH COURT OF ADMIRALTY, after a very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſolemn debate concerning the <hi>legality,</hi> or, <hi>illegality of ſlavery in England,</hi> wherein the merits of the queſtion on both ſides was fully examined and diſcuſſed. A ſhort ſtate of the Caſe, together with the ſubſtance of the decree will be found in Appendix, No. 11. The offence expreſſed in this latter Caſe was ſo flagrantly wicked in all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and upon the whole, was ſo notorious a contempt of the laws and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this kingdom, as well as of <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral right,</hi> and common honeſty, that all perſons, who have any regard for juſtice, muſt be moved with indignation againſt the authors of the miſchief, and muſt wiſh to ſee them corrected by ſome <hi>adequate</hi> and <hi>exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry puniſhment,</hi> inſtead of a deciſion againſt them for the mere <hi>recovery of wages.</hi> In order therefore to prevent any unjuſt prejudice of well meaning people, againſt the manner of proceeding in this caſe for redreſs, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary

                        <q>GEORGE ROGERS alias RIGGES, a negro about nineteen years of age, had been a ſervant to ſeveral gentlemen in <hi>England,</hi> and in the ſummer of 1766,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1083401300:147"/>being then out of place, became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>John Latter</hi> and <hi>John Seſſins,</hi> who contracted with <hi>Arthur Jones</hi> for the ſale of him; an aſſignment was accordingly drawn for that purpoſe, and ſigned by <hi>John Latter,</hi> by which <hi>Rogers</hi> was transferred to Meſſrs. <hi>Maſon</hi> and <hi>Jones,</hi> as a ſlave, for the ſum of twelve guineas.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>SOME time in Auguſt, 1766, after the ſale above mentioned, <hi>Rogers,</hi> under ſome falſe pretences, was carried on board the ſhip <hi>Britannia,</hi> then lying at <hi>Deptford,</hi> of which Meſſrs. <hi>Maſon</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> were owners, was there detained againſt his will, and that hemight not eſcape, was carried down into the ſail room, by order of the chief mate, and the gratings were put upon him. In this confinement he was kept, till the ſhip ſet ſail, when he was releaſed, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go about upon deck; but not being entered in the ſhip's books as a mariner, nor having any particular office, or wages aſſigned to him, he was ſet to work about the ſhip's duty in general till he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as an aſſiſtant to the cook, which office he executed ſometimes as aſſiſtant, and ſometimes as principal cook, during the whole voyage. The ſhip firſt ſailed to the coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> on the SLAVE TRADE,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1083401300:148"/>and from thence to <hi>Porto Rico,</hi> where he was offered to ſale, by the captain of the <hi>Britannia,</hi> as a prime ſlave; but <hi>Rogers</hi> having found an opportunity of relating his ſtory to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> merchants, they refuſed to purchaſe him; he therefore returned with the ſhip, in which he ſtill acted in his former capacity of aſſiſtant cook; and upon their arrival in the port of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1768, when the other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners were paid and diſcharged, he was ſtill detained on board againſt his will.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>HERE he continued for ſome time, till he contrived to give the officers the ſlip, and by the aſſiſtance and advice of ſome friends, went to <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Mr. <hi>Faulckner,</hi> a proctor, to put him in a way of recovering his wages, or ſome other recompence for his labour. Mr. <hi>Faulckner</hi> accordingly wrote to <hi>Arthur Jones,</hi> one of the owners, for that purpoſe; and <hi>Rogers</hi> being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed likewiſe to meet <hi>Jones</hi> at the proctor's office, was waiting at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic houſe, in <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> till ſent for; when <hi>Jones, Seffins,</hi> and another man, came into the houſe, forced <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
                           <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1083401300:149"/>into a coach, conveyed him back, and forced him on board another ſhip, where he was chained to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt, till he was releaſed by the deputy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſhal of the High Court of Admiralty, with the aſſiſtance of Mr. <hi>Shea,</hi> one of his old maſters, and ſome other friends, who had obtained a warrant to take him out of his confinement.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>SEVERAL reaſons prevented his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying for redreſs of theſe injuries, till the beginning of the year 1774, when Mr. <hi>Torriano</hi> was employed to commence an action againſt <hi>Arthur Jones,</hi> as one of the owners, for the purpoſe of recovering the uſual wages, or ſome other recompence in lieu there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>AFTER the uſual proceedings, the cauſe was brought for hearing on June, 29, 1776; when the facts being all clearly proved as above ſtated, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal queſtion was,—<hi>How far the plea of SLAVERY, ſet up by the defendant, could be admitted in bar of the demand of wages?</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>IT was inſiſted on by the counſel on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Rogers,</hi> that the kind of ſlavery, here ſpoken of, never had any exiſtence under the laws of <hi>England;</hi> and in ſupport of that, referred to the well known Caſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1083401300:150"/>of <hi>Knowles</hi> and <hi>Somerſet,</hi> before lord <hi>Mansfield;</hi> and likewiſe to a late one in the PREROGATIVE COURT, of <hi>Cay</hi> and <hi>Crichton.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>THE counſel for the defendant argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, till the caſe of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> the law of <hi>England</hi> admitted ſlavery; and in ſupport of this, they quoted the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale;</hi> and, in particular, the opinions of the Lords <hi>Talbot</hi> and <hi>Hardwick.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Decree of the Court thereupon was, in ſubſtance, as follows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>THERE are two principal points in this cauſe;</hi> (ſaid the Judge)</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>1ſt. <hi>Whether ſuch a ſervice is proved (as ſtated in the ſummary Petition) as to enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the plaintiff to the wages demanded? and</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>2dly. <hi>Whether the plea of ſlavery ſhall be a ſufficient bar to the claim?</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>With regard to the</hi> FIRST, <hi>it appears by the fulleſt evidence, that the plaintiff had ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on board the ſhip, either in the capacity of aſſiſtant to the cook, or as cook himſelf, during the greateſt part of the voyage, and conſequently was entitled to ſome recompence for his ſervices; but not being entered as a mariner in the ſhip's book, nor having any
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1083401300:151"/>ſtipulated wages aſſigned him, it being proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the owners meant to ſell him again in the Weſt Indies, he cannot be allowed any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific ſum under the name of</hi> WAGES; <hi>but as be certainly performed the duty to which he was aſſigned, without any objection to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in it, the maritime law clearly gives him a</hi> QUANTUM MERUIT. <hi>The cook's wages appear to have been</hi> £1. 5<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. per Month, which is more than</hi> Rogers, <hi>maſt probably, could fairly deſerve. But upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the mariners contract, it appears that there were ſeveral negroe boys in the ſame ſhip, in the quality of apprentices, who were allowed from</hi> 10<hi>s. to</hi> 17<hi>s. and</hi> 6<hi>d. per month;</hi>
                        </q> he ſignified his opinion therefore, <hi>that</hi> Rogers <hi>might fairly deſerve</hi> 15<hi>s. per month,</hi> which he accordingly decreed him, from the time of his being firſt carried on board.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>With regard to the</hi> SECOND <hi>point, it was urged</hi> (ſaid the judge) <hi>that the plaintiff was a</hi> SLAVE, <hi>and conſequently was not entitled to any reward for his ſervice at all.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>The practice of buying and ſelling ſlaves</hi> (the learned judge remarked) <hi>was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly very common in</hi> England, <hi>before the caſe of</hi> SOMERSET, <hi>in the Court of King's Bench,</hi> 1772, <hi>but however it might have been the law of the Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi>
                        </q>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:1083401300:152"/>he hoped, <q>
                           <hi>it never was the law of</hi> England.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>The</hi> OPINIONS <hi>of lord</hi> Hardwicke, <hi>and lord</hi> Talbot, <hi>when Attorney and Solicitor general, have been quoted in ſupport of this practice, and have formerly given too much countenance to it, though they ſeemed origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to have been only applied to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence created by baptiſm.</hi>
                        </q>

                        <q>
                           <hi>But by a late determination of one of the ableſt judges that ever preſided in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, theſe opinions have been held to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and unſound; and there can be no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt, that the claim of</hi> SLAVERY <hi>is not maintainable by the laws of</hi> England.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>The law therefore was the ſame before the time of the above opinions, as ſince; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, refers to all ſales whatſoever of this nature; which are every one illegal: and therefore the pretended ſale in the preſent caſe, in</hi> 1766, <hi>was an abſolute nullity; and when the allegation, ſtating the ſale, was admitted on behalf of the owners, had</hi> Rogers <hi>appeared, under proteſt, upon this point of law, it would have been received in bar of the plea!</hi>
                        </q>

                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>The owners ſeem to have acted upon a miſtaken notion of their right; but as the claim of ſlavery is clearly againſt the law of this country, and as it appeared that</hi> Rogers
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1083401300:153"/>
                           <hi>had always acted in ſome uſeful capacity dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole time of his having been on board,</hi>
                        </q> the judge ſaid, he thought <q>
                           <hi>him entitled to a</hi> QUANTUM MERUIT <hi>for his ſervice,</hi>
                        </q>—which he accordingly fixed as above; and condemned the owners in coſts; which were immediately taxed to the amount of £81. 11<hi>s.</hi> 0<hi>d.</hi>

                     <p>AS the great cauſe depending between Mr. <hi>Stuart,</hi> and <hi>Somerſet,</hi> the negro, is at preſent one of the principal topics of general converſation, by inſerting the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing you will afford a ſeaſonable and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional entertainment to your readers.

                        <hi>Extract of a letter from a perſon in</hi> Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>to his friend in</hi> Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I am ſo happy as to think as you do, with regard to trading in man, or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1083401300:155"/>him a ſlave. The cuſtom is wicked and iniquitous, neither conſiſtent with reaſon, or the laws of God or man. Poor unhappy ſlaves, particularly thoſe forced from their places of nativity, are moſt certainly deplorable objects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration. I never bought more than two during twenty years reſidence here. One proved to be the ſon of an African Prince; he was a moſt comely youth: hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved his uncommon good parts, I ſent him to ſchool, and uſed him like a free man during his ſtay with me. The directors of the African Company having enquired, and offered a reward for him, I by a public act preſented the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with his freedom, gave him an order for the reward aforeſaid, and ſent him to London; from whence the following year he remitted me the ſame ſum he coſt me, and ſundry rich goods to the amount of three hundred pounds and upwards, and therewith a letter in his own native lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, tranſlated by Dr. Deſaguillier, of Cambridge.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The next I purchaſed was an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py lad, kidnapped from his free pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents at the taking of Guadaloupe. During his ſtay with me he decayed or pined ſo much, and expreſſed ſo ſenſible a ſorrow of cruel ſeparation from his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1083401300:156"/>aged parents, relations, and countrymen, that actuated by the unerring good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which directs us in all our good deeds, I likewiſe ſet this poor creature free, and ſent him to his native place. Providence again would not excuſe my being further rewarded, for performing this my duty as a Chriſtian. The truly honeſt father, from the produce of his plantations, has made me preſents to the amount of fifty pounds ſterling, with direction to draw upon him for the full coſt of the poor youth, which I do never intend, being more than paid by preſents</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I write this to convince you that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Africa are not ſuch ſenſeleſs brutiſh creatures as thoughtleſs authors repreſent them to be: they undoubtedly are capable of receiving inſtruction, and far out-do Chriſtians in many commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able virtues. Poor creatures! their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt unhappineſs is being acquainted with <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>

                        <q>The following is a letter from the Negro Prince, ſome time after he arrived at <hi>London,</hi> to his maſter in <hi>Maryland.</hi> Tranſlated by Dr. <hi>Deſaguillier,</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> 1743.</q>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>O my kind merciful maſter, my good white brother, too good, a very good ſon of a good woman, and of a very good old man, created good old people by the GREAT SPIRIT, who made my country, thy poor (I ſhould ſay heretofore poor) moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful black priſoner, now rendered rich by thy goodneſs and mercy, is now moſt dead, moſt drunk, moſt mad with joy! Why is he ſo? becauſe he is going to his good warm country, to his good old mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to his good old father, to his little ſiſter and his brother. In my good warm country all things are good, except the white people who live there, and come in flying houſes to take away poor black priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from their mothers, their fathers, their ſiſters and brothers, to kill them with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and filth, in the cellars of their flying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, wherein if they do not die faſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1083401300:158"/>enough, and poor priſoners talk for bread and water, and want to feel the wind, and to ſee THE GREAT SPIRIT, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to him, to tell him all, or to ſee the trees of his good warm country once more for the laſt time, the King of the white people [<hi>prabably the negro meant the captain</hi>] orders the officer called Jack, to kill many of the black priſoners, with whips, with ropes, knives, axes and ſalt. The governor of thy flying houſe has been to ſhew that which is to carry me and him to my good warm country; I am glad, very glad indeed! He goes there with wine. Should he be ſick, (and white people ſeldom eſcape being ſo there,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thee my kind merciful maſter, and good white brother, and becauſe he has been good to me, and is a very good white man too, I will nurſe him myſelf, my mother, my father, my little ſiſter, and my brother, ſhall be his brother, his mother, his father, and his ſiſter too; he ſhall have one large heap of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants teeth and gold, for thee my kind merciful maſter, and kind brother, and one for himſelf alſo (but ſmaller.) He at preſent is my father, I eat at his houſe, and lie there too upon the bed thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me with. His woman is my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1083401300:159"/>and kindly nurſes me, being very ſick of the ſea and fire made of black ſtones. I have received a great quantity of gold, beſides what thou did preſent me with by means of thy hand writing, to the people who are to ſend me to my country, ſome part whereof I have given to the governor of thy ſwimming-houſe, to be ſent to thee; had I an houſeful ſhould ſend the whole with equal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; however, thou ſhalt ſee hereafter, that black people are not beaſts, and do know how to be grateful. After thou my kind merciful maſter and good white bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left me in thy ſwiming-houſe, we, thy white people, and we thy grateful black priſoners, were by the GREAT SPIRIT, who was angry with us, ſent by the wind into an immenſe great river, where we had like to have been drowned, and where we could ſee neither ſun nor moon, for ſix days and nights. I was dying during one whole moon, the governor was my father, and gave me thoſe good things thou preſented me with on my bed, he lodged me in the little room thy carpenter built for me. Thou gave me more cloaths than I could carry, yet I was very cold; nothing avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with poor black priſoner, till at laſt hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing THE GREAT SPIRIT to ſend me ſafe to thy houſe on ſhore, I thought I was carried
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1083401300:160"/>there, [<hi>this appears to have been a dream</hi>] where thou my good white brother did uſe me with wonted goodneſs, ſpake to THE GREAT SPIRIT, and TO HIS SON, that I might keep ſo during the voyage and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, which they have done for thy ſake; they will always do me good becauſe of thee my good white brother; therefore my kind merciful maſter, do not forget thy poor black priſoner. When thou doſt ſpeak to THE GREAT SPIRIT and TO HIS SON, I do know he will hear thee, I ſhall never be ſick more, for which I ſhall be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Pray ſpeak for my good old mother, my good father, my little ſiſter, and my brother; I wiſh they may be healthy, to many very many moons, as many as the hairs on thy head; I love them all much, yet I think not ſo much as I do thee, I could die in my country for thee, could I do thee any kindneſs. Indeed THE GREAT SPIRIT well knows I mean no lie, ſhall always ſpeak to him for thy good, believe me my good white brother, thy poor black priſoner is not a liar.</q>
