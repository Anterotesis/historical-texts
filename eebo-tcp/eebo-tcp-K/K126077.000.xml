            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>, whence the <hi>Gout</hi> in the Feet is ſo termed.</p>
            <p>There are various other Denominations which all take their origin from the parts affected, the Cauſe being ſtill the ſame, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeizing one Place ſometimes another.</p>
            <p>Many are apt to believe the <hi>Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> to be either <hi>Gout</hi> or <hi>Scurvy,</hi> but impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly; it has its Name from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to flow, hence <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Rheum, thereby denoting a Flowing of Humours to a Part, yet the <hi>Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm</hi> partakes ſomewhat of theſe Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The renowned <hi>Sydenham</hi> hath well treated this Diſeaſe, yet muſt own in my Opinion, he makes uſe of bleeding too frequently. It chiefly ſhews itſelf in the ſame Places, where the <hi>Gout</hi> appears, whence in ſome meaſure the Miſtake ariſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lumbago</hi> was obſerved by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients; in which the Pain in the Loins is ſo great, that the Patient is obliged to ſit or ſtand upright: If he moves to either Side, or endeavours to bend forward or backward, then he ſuffers excruciating Pains, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even Convulſions. The ſame Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0724500900:7"/>are found in moving the Neck, if that Part is afflicted, as it often happens to be. When it ſeizes the Region of the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> it is often termed the <hi>lower rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Lumbago;</hi> by ſome alſo it is called the <hi>rheumatic Gonogra,</hi> if in the Knees: Yet this Diſeaſe may for the moſt part be diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Gout</hi> and <hi>Scurvy;</hi> if the Perſon has not had either of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then I ſhould eſteem it the <hi>Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and not the <hi>Gout.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not neceſſary for me here to explain the Cauſe of the regular Fit of the <hi>Gout,</hi> which invades a little before the vernal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinox, and after the autumnal; for <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tringham</hi> has learnedly treated of this<note n="*" place="bottom">Cap. iv. See alſo <hi>De Gorter</hi>'s Commentary in his <hi>Medicina Hippocratica</hi> on <hi>Hipp.</hi> Sect. vi. Aphoriſm 55.</note>.</p>
            <p>The noble <hi>Willis</hi> and <hi>Heinſius</hi> alſo [who has wrote in <hi>Dutch</hi> a Tract of this Malady] deſerves to be read again and again; which makes good the old Proverb,</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Lectio lecta placet, decies repetita placebit.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Gout</hi> under its various Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is either <hi>hereditary</hi> or <hi>acquired.</hi> Its Cauſe is two fold,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> From a Straitneſs and Rigidity or Stiffneſs of the nervous Veſſels.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0724500900:8"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From an Acrimony and Tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Fluids<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>H. Boerh.</hi> Aphoriſm. 1262-63.</note>.</p>
            <p>Hence every Fault committed in the <hi>Non-naturals</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">To wit, Air, Meat and Drink, Sleep and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Motion and Reſt, Retention and Excretion, and the Paſſions of the Mind.</note> (as they are termed by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians) haſten and bring on the Fit. It principally afflicts in Parts remote from the Brain. The Defect lies in the laſt Office of Digeſtion. 1ſt. From our Food is Chyle produced, 2dly. The Serum or Whey, 3dly. The Blood, and laſtly, The nervous Spirit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Viſcera,</hi> or Organs of the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions are good, but that ultimate or laſt Effect is not properly performed. Our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Faculty, the great <hi>Boerhaave</hi> is of the ſame Opinion; for he ſaw a Patient who had about the Joint a Swelling that broke without Pain; he forced a Needle quite through to the Bone without any Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, and took out this chalky Matter which was made up with the ſmalleſt Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, thus deſtroyed and changed. It is alſo plain, that the Blood, Serum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not in fault, for they equally exerciſe their ſeveral Functions; the gouty Subject can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon properly, and feels the Power of Love as before: Hence I have often admired <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> where he ſays, the <hi>Gout</hi> cleanſes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0724500900:9"/>the moſt minute Receſſes of the Blood in old Men; for after a Fit, they, for the moſt part remain free and well for Months; and in this Courſe, they may obtain the good old Age of Fourſcore or upwards; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Diſeaſe muſt not be in the Blood, but in the Ultimate <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Spirit of the Blood.</p>
            <p>Hence it is neceſſary (as alſo <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont</hi> obſerves) that the whole Body be recruited in the Solids, and the Fluids mended, and corrected before the Cure can be accompliſhed; but this is to be done by reſtorative Medicaments, and not thoſe of a purgative Quality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Otto Tachenius</hi> (in his Tract <hi>de Morborum Principe</hi>) ſays, that a ſubtile corroding Acid is the Cauſe of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and hence an <hi>Alcali,</hi> it being quite an Oppoſite, deſtroying and driving out the Malady, he eſteems as a Specific: which acrid Cauſe, ariſing from too great Rigidity or Straitneſs in the Veſſels, Venery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> deſtroys the beſt and fineſt Part of the Nerves. He got great Profit by this Invention, yet the Medicine did not anſwer. It is inſcribed on the Statue erected to the Memory of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> that he could cure the <hi>Gout,</hi> by which, I ſuppoſe, is to be underſtood, he cured the Fit by order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good Diet, giving proper Anodynes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this does not root out the Seeds of the Diſeaſe; Nature left to herſelf would have performed thus much.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0724500900:10"/>
            <p>A Man in <hi>Holland</hi> made Trial of all the Remedies he could pick up, among the reſt the <hi>Caryocoſtinum,</hi> but was much the worſe for it, notwithſtanding the great Praiſes given it by its Inventor <hi>Eugenius.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>During the Paroxyſm or Fit, I carefully avoid every Thing which may hinder or diſturb the Evacuation of the peccant Matter. Therefore I ſhun bleeding, for the Blood being leſſened in Quantity, the Preſſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the excretory Veſſels is likewiſe dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and thus the Matter which ſhould be evacuated, is retained, whereby grievous and heavy Symptoms enſue ‡.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Wintringham</hi> directs Emetics and Purgatives to be repeated occaſionally, in order to clear the <hi>Primae Viae</hi> of their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0724500900:13"/>but I abſtain from ſuch Remedies, for they occaſion a Tumult in the nervous Juices, draw off the more fluid Parts, and deſtroy their expulſive Power<note n="*" place="bottom">Herm. Boerhaave <hi>Aph. 1271.</hi>
               </note>, whereby the natural Secretions are much hindred.</p>
            <p>Medicines that encourage Sweat, and alſo thoſe that paſs by Urine, make the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood more rapid, and of Courſe the offending Matter is determined in a larger Quantity to be ſeparated and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off, hence the preſent Fit will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. It is beſt that the Concoction and Evacuation of the gouty Matter be left to the ſole Work of Nature.</p>
            <p>I would refer the Reader to the 1273d Aphoriſm of the immortal <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> it deſerving a particular Regard, nay even all of them on this Subject are well worth our peruſal.</p>
            <p>During the Fit, we can only endeavour to render the Pain as mild as poſſible, by blunting the Acrimony or Sharpneſs of the morbid Matter, and gently helping forward its Expulſion out of the Body. To effect this, I endeavour to dilute and thin the Blood, that the Matter unfit for Circulation, and lodged at the Joints, may flow with more Facility and Eaſe. I order a <hi>temperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powder,</hi> three or four Times in a Day, with a <hi>medicated</hi> Liquor to be plentifully drank. When the Pain is ſevere and ſcarce
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0724500900:14"/>ſufferable, I give fifty, ſixty or ſeventy Dops of an <hi>anodyne Elixir</hi> in a large Draught of the above Drink.

            <p>Out of the Fit, I take Care to prevent the Encreaſe of the gouty Matter, alſo to ſhake off that which has, in ſome meaſure, begun to fix itſelf. And for that Purpoſe.</p>
