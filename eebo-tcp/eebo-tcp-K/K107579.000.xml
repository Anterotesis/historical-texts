            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Rules of Art.</p>
            <p>That it is truly ſtated, I dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to one of you, Mr. Warden <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renden,</hi> who was at ſeveral Time pleaſed to be an Eye-Witneſs, at the Times of Dreſſing.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that my Patient at length dying, I might have conceal'd the Caſe, as affording leſs Matter of Inſtruction to the young Practitioner: for whom principally it was intended; I anſwer, and that without vain Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is more of Art requir'd to protract Life, under the moſt immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Danger, than there is to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0717200600:4"/>a Cure where that Danger is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: And farther, whatever it may appear to others, I dare ſay 'twill be no Paradox to you, ſhould I affirm that the remarkable and ſuccesful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of ſome, have been in great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure owing to the rational, altho' ſucceſleſs Attempts upon others.</p>
            <p>The Diſſection that has been employ'd upon Morbid Bodyes after Death, has enrich'd both <hi>Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Surgery,</hi> with many uſeful Improvements, and he who thinks it not worth while to take Notice of any other Caſe, than where a Cure has been completed: is leaſt likely to be inſtrumental in the Performance of any one that is extraordinary.</p>
            <p>I pretend to no new Light in <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery:</hi> Nor ſhall I by any means recede from the old, unleſs that enlightned Gentleman Dr. <hi>C.</hi>— can by <hi>Autopſy</hi> convince me, that any conſiderably
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0717200600:5"/>contus'd Wound is to be cur'd by other firſt Intention, than that of Digeſtion or engendring matter: 'Till this be done, he is to excuſe me if I think him more in the dark than thoſe who never heard of his falſe <hi>Meteor,</hi> and quickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd Light.</p>
            <p>That Wounds of the <hi>Brain,</hi> and other Noble Parts, are inconditionately curable: ſeems of a like Stretch with the former; yet want we not a late Blazing Star, in Compariſon of the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Light, from t'other ſide the Water, to portend they are ſo.</p>
            <p>But if theſe Immortaliſers of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, could perform what they pretend to; how comes it to paſs that not one more ſurpriſing (if well atteſted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery) has hen wrought by them, than we are able to produce in the Way of common Practice, perform'd by Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuos Artiſts, long before the World
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0717200600:6"/>was fobb'd by theſe arrogant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences?</p>
            <p>'Tis evident there never wanted ſome bold and confident Pretender to work Wonders in each Art or Science: <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> and <hi>Phyloſophy,</hi> as well as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks</hi> have had their Hereticks equally with <hi>Divinity:</hi> Nor was there ever any thing (how abſurd ſo ever) ſtarted by Phyloſophers of differing Sects, but quickly gain'd its Proſelues, amongſt unthinking and unwary Perſons. Thus on the one hand, no ſonner does the Knaviſh or (at beſt) deluded <hi>Facio</hi> and his Crew ſound forth the Trumpet, but Herds of Fellow Prophets take the Alarm, and Men, diſtinguiſh'd, as well by Senſe as Title and Eſtate, are drawn in amongſt the beedleſs Rabble.</p>

            <p>ON the 24th of <hi>February,</hi> 1708/9. I was called in much Haſt, to a Child about the Age of Six Years, who was juſt then brought out of <hi>Moor-Fields,</hi> wounded by a Catſtick, as he was ſitting at ſome Diſtance from a Cock, ſet to be thrown at; where a young Fellow, miſſing his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>m, unfortunately ſtruck the Child over the Head, and knock'd him down. He was taken up for dead, and continued ſpeechleſs for ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon examining the Head, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a ſmall Wound on the right Side, which had bled freely, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Fingers hard upon the Part, under a Sort of Quagmire of gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Blood, I found there muſt be a conſiderable Depreſſion of that Part of the <hi>Scull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt I was delivering my Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtic of the Child's great Danger, and telling them of the Neceſſity there was to make Way to the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, by removing ſome Part of the <hi>Scalp,</hi> the Boy began to cry and fell a vomiting.

            <p>The next Day I call'd in Mr. <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> and together viſiting, we found the Child had been hot and reſtleſs all Night. His retching to vomit having left him: When we had taken him out of Bed, and placed him in a good Light, I took off the Bandage and Dreſſings, and paſſing a Probe into the Wound, plainly felt the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> for a great Compaſs, denudated of its Covering.</p>
            <p>I began to draw a ſemicircular Line on the Outſide of the Depreſſion, as a Direction for my Knife; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perpendicular from the one Point to the other; that we might feel the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0717200600:24"/>Extent of the Fracture, before we re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moved any more of the <hi>Scalp.</hi> The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whilſt Mr. <hi>B</hi>— kept the Head ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I cut thro' my half Circle to the <hi>Cranium,</hi> and found I was juſt beyond the Edge of the fractur'd Bone; but drawing my Knife upon the ſtreight Line, it ſlipt in a conſiderable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Superfice unawares; which Mr. <hi>B</hi> — perceiving, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew the ſame to make Way for his Finger, by which he diſcover'd ſo great a Vacuity, that we conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Bones were beat thro' both <hi>Meninges</hi> into the Subſtance of the <hi>Brain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this, he approv'd of my making another Semicircle, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the <hi>Scalp</hi> on the oppoſite Side, by which we might have the whole Fracture in full View, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly I diſpatch' the Work, and took from the <hi>Scalp</hi> a Circle, in all as large, or ſomewhat larger than a five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Piece: when immediately we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd this vaſt Fracture and Depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (exactly enough delineated in the following Table) of four Angles, ſunk
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0717200600:25"/>ſo low beneath the Surface of the other Part of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> as to make a Cavity ſufficient to contain near two Ounces of Liquor.</p>
            <p>The outward Table was broke all round, whilſt the inward was only bow'd: upon which Account there was no room for an Elevator, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any other Inſtrument, by which we could hope to raiſe up the depreſt Bones, without the Help of the <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan.</hi> The <hi>Terebra</hi> was propos'd, but concluded inſufficient as well as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous; inſufficient to lift up the Bones, unleſs we could go quite thro', and hazardous by going thro', of wounding the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> which if not lacerated by the prodigious Stretch, muſt needs bear tight againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide of the fractur'd Bone. The <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> in ſo young a Child was thought likewiſe to have its Danger: the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane</hi> in young Children lying high, and in a Manner continuous to the Inſide of the <hi>Scull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, here was no room for long Delay, the foreſaid Part ſubja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, being ſo wonderfully oppreſs'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0717200600:26"/>by the Points of the Bones, thro' the Clefts of which we might perceive a manifeſt Oſcillation. Yet for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we could do nothing more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſturbed in our Work, by a Flux of Blood from an inciſed Artery, to the Mouth of which I clapt a ſmall Button of Lint, dipt in equal Parts of <hi>Bole</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> fill'd up the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Edges with dry Lint, and a Compreſs wrung out of <hi>Oxycrate</hi> and <hi>Albumen Ovi,</hi> ſtrow'd with <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina Tritici,</hi> to be lay'd over all, and rolled the Head up again for this Second Dreſſing.</p>
            <p>I viſited in the Evening, and found a quick Pulſe, Thirſt and <hi>Head-ach;</hi> eſpecially toward the Forehead, but no Vomiting.

            <p>The 27th, I viſited again by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, found the Child ſomewhat fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh, but without other ill Symptom.</p>
            <p>Having his Head ſupported betwixt the Hands of an Attendant upon the Nurſe's Knee, I began to malax the Bandage and Dreſſings, (very ſtiff by reaſon of the effuſed Blood) with a little <hi>Ol.

            <p>I now could plainly perceive the Extent of the Fracture, which lay all in View, and finding it would be fruitleſs to attempt the Reduction of the depreſt Bones to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Places (which were ſo faſt lock'd in) by any other Means, reſolv'd to make Way for ſetting on the <hi>Trepan.</hi>

            <p>Having apply'd two or three warm Flannels, and filled up the Cavity with dry Lint, I concluded the beſt Part for Trepaning, as likewiſe for the Elevator, would be above the Fracture: which being ſeated on the right <hi>Bregma</hi> was bounded forwards by the <hi>Coronal,</hi> backwards by the <hi>Lamdoide,</hi> upwards by the <hi>Sagittal,</hi> and downwards by the <hi>Squammous Suture.</hi> And indeed ſo near to this latter (as may be ſeen in the Figure hereto annex'd) that there was not room for the <hi>Trepan</hi> below. When I had therefore drawn a Circle above, within a quarter of an Inch, or leſs of the broken Edge, I took out a proportionate Piece of the <hi>Scalp,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the Compaſs of a mill'd Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which my Patient never winch'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0717200600:30"/>at: altho' he told his Nurſe the Day before, he thought at his firſt cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, we would not leave him 'till we had taken off all the Fleſh from that Side of his Head. I had now no Occaſion for any Reſtringent, ſo that dreſſing up the Bones all dry, I apply'd a large Pledgit of Liniment upon ſoft Tow over the Lips, and rolled up his Head for that Day.</p>
            <p>His Drink, which was indeed his whole Diet, was <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> boil'd together, <hi>Barley-Water, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> and betwixt whiles a ſmall <hi>Sack Whey.</hi> A Clyſter was repeated alſo at this Time, and his <hi>Anodyne</hi> at Night.</p>
            <p>This Preparation being made for the Work, I went to Mr. Warden <hi>Herenden,</hi> ſtated the Caſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Conſultation at Three next Day, after Dinner; deſiring he would not fail me; that I might be juſtify'd in the Operation.

I was not in the leaſt concern'd hereat, well knowing he would alter his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, upon a Sight of the Wound; and taking off the Dreſſings, he ſeem'd aſtoniſh'd that a Child, under ſuch a violent Preſſure of that moſt noble Part, (the Source of all the other <hi>Membranes,</hi> if we may truſt a late new Syſtem) from the forcibly intruded Bones, ſhould labour under no worſe Symptom than a <hi>Head-ach,</hi> and be in a Condition to walk about the Chamber.</p>
            <p>Pleas'd with the Child's Courage, he plac'd him againſt the Nurſe's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and took upon himſelf to keep his Head ſteady, whilſt I began to work with the <hi>Trepan;</hi> obſerving that admirable Axiom, <hi>Feſtina lente,</hi> I gently turn'd the Inſtrument, now and then taking it up to clean, 'till I had got to the <hi>Diploe:</hi> when lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>In few Minutes the Work was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd, and being willing to have it out as clear as I could, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Occaſion to ſhiver off any Part that might remain undivided by the Saw, I thought to paſs gently a Turn more upon the adhering Side, and ſo remove my Inſtrument; when at firſt ſomewhat ſurpriz'd, we mis'd the perforated Bone, and were ready to ſurmiſe, the <hi>Membrane</hi> being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where lacerated underneath, had let it in, and return'd by its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Elaſticity again to its Convexity; but looking into the Inſtrument we found it in the Bore.

The <hi>Dura Mater</hi> appear'd fair, tho' ſomewhat ſtorid from its Inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And now we immediately ſet about the lifting up the depreſt Bones; in order to which paſſing carefully my Elevator thro' the Perforation, and heedfully obſerving that the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane</hi> might not ſlip between my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and the fractur'd Bone I was about to raiſe; I began to lift, having placed the End of the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument under the Center of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and moſt likely of them; when bearing up with conſiderable Force, I found it would not ſtir: on which Account I drew back my Elevator, and arming its Shank with a ſoft Rag, placed alſo a linnen Bolſter upon that Part of the Edge of the ſound <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> which was to be its <hi>Fulcrum.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0717200600:34"/>
            <p>Being thus provided, I convey'd it in once more, and with redoubled Force perceived it began to give; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the ſame Force, it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately flew up, and ſhiver'd off the inner Table.</p>
            <p>This Bone extracted, our Work was much facilitated, nor had we farther Occaſion to paſs our Inſtrument thro' the Bore; for by ſhifting our <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum,</hi> or reſting upon another Part we could command the other Peices at our Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>There had been a Debate the Day before, betwixt Mr. <hi>B</hi> — and my ſelf, whether after extracting one or two of the Bones, we ſhould not leave the Remainder, having raiſed them up to their Places, in expectation that they might agglutinate, or unite by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a <hi>Callus;</hi> by which the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> would be defended from lying bare ſo large a Compaſs, and our Work ſhorten'd, in reſpect to the Cure, if ſuch a thing might be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd.

            <p>Having remov'd theſe four Peices of Bones, of the exact Shape and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion with thoſe expreſs'd in the annex'd Scheme, the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to vibrate ſtrongly, and raiſed it ſelf at the ſame Inſtant, to fill up the ſurpriſing <hi>Chaſm;</hi> which wiping gently with a Piece of a ſoft Sponge wrung out of a little warm Claret, I preſently co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd that and the bored Part, with ſuitable Syndons of white Sarſnet, dipt only in <hi>Mel Roſarum,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my dry Lint upon the Lips, and having laid the Digeſtive over all, I rolled up his Head.</p>
            <p>After the Work was over, he was carry'd to Bed, being refreſh'd with two or three Spoonfulls of his <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic</hi> Julep.</p>
            <p>From this Day our Work ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went on with a proſperous Aſpect; the <hi>Cephalalgye</hi> much abated, the Pulſe grew calm and the Child lively; ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0717200600:36"/>continuing for Four or Five Days. The <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> both in the Place of the Perforation, as well as that where the Bones had been extracted, began to be beſprinked with little Grains of Fleſh, only in the midſt of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there appear'd a kind of Slough, occaſion'd by the Points of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt Bones, which by grating hard had ras'd the outward <hi>Membrane;</hi> to digeſt and haſten Separation of which, I dreſs'd thoſe Parts with a little of the <hi>Balſam. Terebinth.</hi> added to the <hi>Mel Roſarum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſooner was this Part mundify'd, and a Sort of granulated Fleſh had cloathed the bare <hi>Membrane:</hi> but our <hi>Head-ach</hi> return'd afreſh with greater Extremity than ever, the <hi>Symptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Fever</hi> and Reſtleſneſs alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd; ſo that on the 5th of <hi>March,</hi> about Five Days after the Operation, upon taking off the Bandage, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd there had been a much greater Diſcharge than could be reaſonably expected from the outſide Wounds; and removing the Dreſſings, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a <hi>Stuph</hi> wrung out of the Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0717200600:37"/>took notice of an offenſive Smell, when looking carefully upon the <hi>Membrane,</hi> thoro' a ſmall <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilla,</hi> or Grain of the new incarned Fleſh, where the Slough had thrown off, there ouzed out a faetid Matter from underneath.</p>
            <p>Believing the Caſe to be deſperate, I armed a ſmall Pledgit with <hi>Linim. Arcaei.</hi> dipping the ſame in the 'fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Mixture of <hi>Mel. Roſ.</hi> and <hi>Balſ. Tereb.</hi> to apply on the Part, whence the Matter iſſued forth. The other Parts of the <hi>Membrane</hi> I cover'd with the <hi>Syndons</hi> of Sarſnet, moiſten'd only with the <hi>Mel. Roſ.</hi> and clapping the Edges of the Silk under the ſhiver'd Edge of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> that the ſubja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent noble Part might not be offended thereby, I dreſt as before and rolled up the Head.</p>
            <p>The next Day intending to make Apertion thro' the <hi>Meninx,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Brain</hi> of the fluctuating Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I acquainted Mr. <hi>H</hi>—, told him what I had diſcover'd, and the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of our farther proceeding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 6. we met in Conſultation,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0717200600:38"/>where we found the Matter ſomewhat leſſen'd in its Diſcharge, tho' ſtill abundantly too much. The Lips which, the Day before were fallen, looking white and flabby, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carn'd <hi>Granules</hi> of Fleſh, upon the <hi>Membrane</hi> which were then ſinking and of the ſame Colour, had now as it were reviv'd, and put on a freſh Complexion; nor could we perceive the leaſt Drop of Matter, burſting thro' in any Part of the <hi>Membrane,</hi> or any room for a Probe, where I had remark'd it ouzing forth.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Considerations, tho' the Symptoms ſtill kept up, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, I mean the <hi>Fever, Watching,</hi> and <hi>Headach,</hi> yet Mr. <hi>H</hi>— ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing I might be miſtaken in my ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdays Remark, or hoping the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (lodging only betwixt the <hi>Dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature</hi>) had made its <hi>Exit:</hi> perſwaded me to dreſs up, and endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Child ſome other way; to which Purpoſe, upon further Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it was agreed, that I ſhould preſently open the <hi>Jugular</hi> on the ſame ſide, out of which running briskly, and in a full Stream, we drew Six Ounces
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0717200600:39"/>of Blood. A <hi>Veſicatory</hi> was alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the Neck, and an <hi>Emollient</hi> Clyſter thrown up in the Evening. The <hi>Anti-epileptic</hi> Powders were repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with the Addition of two Grains of <hi>Sal Vol. C. C.</hi> to each Paper: The <hi>Cephalic Julep ut antea.</hi> and if the <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach</hi> did not remit by the next Day, Leaches were concluded to be ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Ears, as alſo to each Temple.</p>
            <p>The 7th, I call'd again, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Nurſe the Child had a bad Night; was then hot and reſtleſs, and cry'd out of his Head.</p>
            <p>This Afternoon I took off the Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, perceiv'd the Bandage and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs were fouled with the Matter, likewiſe the Pillow he had lain on, which confirm'd my beleif that it was highly rational to make an Aperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thro' the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and that without ſo doing, all other Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours would prove uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>The Dreſſings taken off, I plainly obſerv'd from whence the Matter had come forth, but could not find a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for my Probe, altho there was a ſmall Drop of Matter in the Mouth of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0717200600:40"/>the <hi>Papillary Excreſcens,</hi> the ſuppoſed Place of its Vent. There being no Artiſt by to juſtify my Proceeding, I dreſt up again as before, the <hi>Warden</hi> having promis'd to meet me on the 8th, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which Interval, ſo great a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the purulent Matter bad workt out, as to afford ſome Relief to the <hi>Brain,</hi> ſo that the Symptoms grew milder: He try'd at this Dreſſing with his Probe, but could find no Entrance: The Wound lookt freſh, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carning ruddy, tho' not much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd for 3 or 4 Days paſt. However, (much contrary to my own Sentiments) I was again prevail'd upon to dreſs up, continuing my wonted Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to wait a little longer, to ſee what farther Time might produce, unleſs freſh Symptoms call'd for a Penetration, of which I was to give notice.</p>
            <p>Thus we continu'd to the 15th, the Pain 'twixt whiles remitting and returning, a ſtinking Gleet with much Matter upon our Dreſſings: One Day we ſeemed to get Ground, but the next loſt it. The Lips again grew
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0717200600:41"/>flaccid, and the Fleſh upon the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane</hi> looſe and pallid; ſo that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to wait no longer, I went again to Mr. <hi>H</hi>— and told him I ſhould loſe my little Patient, if he would not comply with my dividing the <hi>Membrane:</hi> He readily offer'd me his Aſſiſtance, and came according to his Appointment.</p>
            <p>When we came into the Chamber, the Child was crying very dolefully of his Head: There was a fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid Smell by the Bedſide, from the putrid <hi>Effluvia,</hi> ariſing from the pent up Matter: And tho' we were ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there was far too great a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to proceed from the Wound, yet could we not, even at this Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, diſcover the Orifice that had let it out. The <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the <hi>Membrane</hi> likewiſe hindring us, from apprehending any Fluctuation under our Fingers: So that I cannot any ways blame, nor would I reflect by any Means upon that Gentleman's Judgment and great Caution in this Affair; he having never ſeen the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ariſing out of the incarned Fleſh,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0717200600:42"/>as I had done, and might think, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, I was therein deceiv'd.</p>
            <p>I was at this Time extreamly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to dreſs again, 'till I had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a freer Vent: and attempted the Search once more with my Probe, yet ſtill without Succeſs: At laſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hard down upon one Side of the ſtrongly reſiliating <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> a ſmall Drop of Matter blubber'd out of the aforeſaid <hi>Papilla,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Warden</hi> perceiving, immediately took out a fine Probe from his Box, and preſſing gently down, got in; very readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giving Way to make an Apertion: whilſt his Probe which he bore up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, was to guide my Lancet: with which Direction I paſſed the ſame in, and made a Wound about a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Inch in Length; when exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining more narrowly with the Probe, we found (having not the Diſcharge we expected) that it was got betwixt the Duplicature of the <hi>Membrane;</hi> ſo that without Delay, examining again, he ſoon got under to the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> when raiſing up the Part as before with his Probe, I cut cloſe to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0717200600:43"/>Side thereof, 'till I had made a Wound of half an Inch, by which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd a vaſt Quantity of ſtinking <hi>Pus,</hi> interſpers'd with two or three ſmall Globules of the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the <hi>Brain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this laſt Inciſion, we were put to a Dilemma: a ſmall <hi>Capillary Artery</hi> being divided in the inmoſt Coat of this <hi>Membrane.</hi> Here was no Place for biting <hi>Stiptics,</hi> nor indeed for the common Reſtringents; ſome Part of which, with the utmoſt Care, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably fall in upon the <hi>Brain,</hi> and there produce very bad Effects, if not the moſt direful Symptoms: Nor was there, by any reſiſting Body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, any hope that by Compreſſion, we could ſtay the Flux.</p>
            <p>The Moment of its ſpurting up, Mr. <hi>H</hi>— with an armed Probe preſt cloſe upon the Mouth thereof, which did me double Service, by reſtraining its Bleeding and dilating the Wound, whilſt I conveyed a Doſſil ty'd round with Thread, whoſe End hung out for the ſecure Extraction, dipt in the above-mentioned <hi>Mel Roſarum,</hi> into
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0717200600:44"/>a ſmall Quantity of which, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Stench and Putrifaction, I had before-hand inſtilled a few Drops of a <hi>Tinct: Myrh:</hi> drawn in White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine. Clapping this down ſoftly upon the tender <hi>Meninx,</hi> or rather upon the <hi>Brain</hi> it ſelf, the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> being here eroded, and having made up a ſecond Doſſil ſomewhat tighter, and fitted to the Dimenſions of the Wound, ty'd likewiſe with a Thread as the other: whilſt he took away his armed Probe, I clap'd it cloſe upon the wounded Veſſel, which being but <hi>Capillary,</hi> we were in Hopes would be ſoon choak'd by this kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <p>Being dreſs'd up, he was carry'd to his Bed, Mr. <hi>H</hi>— acquainting the Parents, that his Caſe was truly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if not deſperate abſolutely: and I my ſelf indeed believing, I ſhould not often dreſs him after. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſidering with the great <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> that there is a <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The next Day after opening the <hi>Membrane,</hi> the <hi>Fever</hi> and <hi>Head-ach</hi> did again remit, our Patient was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly reliev'd: And what is a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Inſtance of the Truth of that grand Phyſical Axiom, <hi>Natura eſt ſui Conſervatrix:</hi> we could perceive the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> plainly to do the Office of a Pump, throwing off at every <hi>Syſtole</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0717200600:46"/>a large Quantity of the offenſive Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, together with ſeveral conſiderable <hi>Thrombi</hi> of the grumous Blood, which had been effus'd from the bleeding Artery, and fallen inwardly upon the <hi>Brain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this Dreſſing likewiſe I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ſome ſmall Particles of the <hi>Brain,</hi> mixed with the Matter and Blood aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Thus we continued on the mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hand: So that in few Days more our little Patient began to call for his Play-Fellows, and walk'd ſturdily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Chamber. The Matter dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſſen'd, grew perfectly ſweet and well concocted: altho' ſtill ſome Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity thereof (upon Removal of the Dreſſings) we could diſcern to be lifted out by the Vibration of the <hi>Membrane,</hi> whoſe proper Elater (as I juſt now hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) well ſupply'd the Place of the <hi>Antlia</hi> or Sucker in the Pump or Syringe, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the offending Matter, ſo far as lay within the Spheer of its Activity.</p>
            <p>The ſame Applications were ſtill continu'd leaving out the <hi>Tinct. Myrh.</hi> and putting in daily a ſoft
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0717200600:47"/>Doſſil thro' the Wound, dipt only in the <hi>Mel Roſarum,</hi> upon the <hi>Pia Mater;</hi> the <hi>Syndons</hi> being alſo moiſten'd in the ſame, which were laid upon the upper <hi>Membrane:</hi> 'till ſuch Time as it was firmly incarn'd, and the Fleſh even with the Superfice of the <hi>Crani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi> about which Time I left off the the <hi>Mel. Roſ.</hi> unleſs a ſmall Pledgit upon the wounded Part of it: uſing nothing but dry Lint, which however deſpicable, is ſurely the beſt of Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings at theſe Times, by which and a ſlight Touch of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> Stone, I kept off the luxuriant Fleſh (at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times troubleſome, when improperly treated) and diſpoſed the Edges of the Bones for Deſquamation, which in Seven Weeks Time was accompliſh'd: A ſmall Part only, and that upon one Side, exfoliating viſibly.</p>
            <p>By the 10th of <hi>May,</hi> our incarned Fleſh grew callous, the Pulſation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath but little perceptible, and a ſound <hi>Cicatrix</hi> brought over to the very Edge of the Apertion, which had been made upon the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> and thro' which we had
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0717200600:48"/>ſtill a Diſcharge of laudable <hi>Pus,</hi> tho' inconſiderable to what it had been.</p>
            <p>We kept him all this while to his firſt Allowance of <hi>Water-gruel, Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, Barley-gruel, Milk, Pottage;</hi> his Drink chiefly <hi>Milk</hi> boil'd with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but growing brisk, and playing about as cheerfully as ever, when he had been purged two or three times with <hi>Manna,</hi> he had the Liberty of a more free and airy Chamber, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed treſpaſs'd ſo far as to get down Stairs, to eat (tho' ſparingly) freſh Meat every other Day; and could not be reſtrained from all his uſual Exerciſes and Diverſions.</p>
            <p>Our Buſineſs now was to contrive the keeping open the Wound I had made in the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> which was ready to cloſe upon us, tho' of the utmoſt Conſequence to be kept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, whilſt there was any Matter to be dreined off.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>B</hi> — being got abroad, was eaſily prevail'd upon to give us a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, and having inſpected the Work, paſſed in his Probe down to the <hi>Pia Mater.</hi> but finding no ſlanting <hi>Sinus,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0717200600:49"/>on1y a direct one to the <hi>Brain,</hi> concluded there was no dilating; for indeed, where could we cut, unleſs upon this lower <hi>Meninx,</hi> or into the <hi>Brain</hi> it ſelf. Our Work was all in the dark: Nor could we know the Source of the Matter, daily diſcharging in ſmall Quantity; ſo that all we could do, was to prevent the Coalition of the Wound, hoping that in Time the ſaid Matter might be cleanſed off, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate it ſelf up higher into the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious Body that was there formed from the Veſſels and <hi>Membranes</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacent, when we might with more Safety enlarge, and give a freer Vent.</p>
            <p>For keeping the Wound open, which was the more difficult in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Part, I propoſed a little <hi>Cannula,</hi> but he rather preferr'd a Bit of Sponge Tent, which he thought would not only lye much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, but imbibing the Matter, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it at the ſame Time.</p>
            <p>With this I comply'd, and put in a ſmall Peice, faſten'd about with a String on the upper Part.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0717200600:50"/>
            <p>Next Day, when I came to open the Wound, I found the Matter (as I fear'd) was entirely pent in; nor had one Drop of it paſſed either by the Sides, or thro' the Pores of the Sponge; but drawing the ſame forth by the Thread, a conſiderable Quantity (col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the Twenty Four Hours paſt) guſht forth, and continued to be thrown off by the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> 'till it had empty'd the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all it could lift up.</p>
            <p>The Orifice being now enlarged by the Tent: I apply'd a ſmall Pledgit of Liniment on the outſide; having before-hand dropped in with a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Drop or two of <hi>Mel Roſ.</hi> and obſerved this Way of Dreſſing, ſtill breaking aſunder the uniting Fibres, with my Probe, where they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to coaleſce; and dipping its End in Oyl, beſmear'd the Lips of the Wound, by which Means the Matter which became now again inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, made its Way without Obſtacle.</p>
            <p>And thus we continu'd to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>May;</hi> our young Gentleman growing fleſhy, and enjoying a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0717200600:51"/>State of Health than he had done ſome Years before.</p>
            <p>About this Time, meeting my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> and my Brother <hi>Blundel,</hi> in Conſultation at another Place; and paſſing by my Patient's Houſe, I invited them to walk in, where they ſaw him dreſs'd, and took a View of the extracted Bones. Mr. <hi>B</hi>— had the Curioſity again to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Wound, and having the Probe ſtreight down for about half an Inch, diſcovered a ſlanting <hi>Sinus,</hi> not before obſerv'd, as very likely but lately made: when drawing it forth, to bend the End, he paſſed the ſame in again, and lifting up the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, we could perceive it near an Inch diſtant from the Place it enter'd.</p>
            <p>Having made this Diſcovery, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, if the Diſcharge continued much longer, or any Symptom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, to cut into this Cavity: For I had taken Notice that ſeveral of our late Dreſſings had been diſturbed from the Child's Scratching: Inſomuch that altho' the ſame Bandage was all along continued, yet by the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0717200600:52"/>from breeding of Lice, from Dandrif, or Humour under the <hi>Cuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> ſome one or all theſe Cauſes, there grew ſo troubleſome an Irching, that in the Night he had got all off: The Wound was upon cloſing, and a dry cruſty Scurf, or caked Matter had choaked up the Orifice.</p>
            <p>The ſame Day the By-ſtanders had obſerv'd a Sort of Rigour had ſeiz'd him, which went off in a Moment. Whilſt I was dreſſing him next Day, I perceiv'd ſomewhat of that Kind, and asked him what he ailed, he reply'd briskly enough, he could not tell, nor could he help it.</p>
            <p>The Wound was again open'd by the <hi>Digeſtive</hi> I had apply'd the Day before; and the ſcabby Cruſt caſt off, with a ſmall Quantity of Matter as uſual. To prevent the like Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of rubbing off his Dreſſings, I laid over my Pledgit a more adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Emplaſter, clipt the Hair cloſe, and rolling up his Head, carefully cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd him to keep his Hands off.</p>
            <p>I was very much concerned at theſe Rigours, and fearfull leſt the Matter
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0717200600:53"/>ſhould have got into the Blood, or tainted the Nerves, by inſinuating it ſelf thro' the Cortical Part of the <hi>Brain:</hi> but did not expect the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize ſo ſudden; for early the next Morning I was alarmed with the News, that the Child was ſeized with a violent <hi>Convulſion.</hi> I haſten'd, and found him ſenſeleſs, very ſtrongly twitcht on the contrary Side: The <hi>Tendons</hi> of that Arm and Leg eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, perpetually relaxing and again contracting: Upon which, 'till they thought fit to ſend for a Phyſician, I preſcribed thus to their <hi>Apothecary.</hi>

            <p>Having made this Proviſion, the beſt I could ſurmiſe, for his Relief; whilſt the Medicines were preparing, I had him taken out of Bed, and ſtrongly ſupported upon the Knees of an Attendant.

            <p>In the Evening I return'd again, found the Child ſenſible: his Fits had been off and on, at two or three Hours Diſtance: He then complain'd of being ſick, and retcht to vomit; his <hi>Head-ach</hi> alſo was very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the 18th, which was the Day after theſe <hi>Convulſions,</hi> I undreſt his Head, and found all things had an ill Aſpect: The Wound was indigeſted, the Lips puffed up, and riſen to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Heighth above the reſt of the Parts, diſcharging only a bloody <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I fomented again as I had done thro' the whole Courſe of my Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, ordering each Time the <hi>Fotus</hi> was taken from the Fire, two Spoonfulls of the <hi>Aq. Hungaric.</hi> to be put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, apply'd ſeveral warm <hi>Stuphs,</hi> and with my Digeſtive made up as before. At this Time I obſerv'd a <hi>Lypothumia,</hi> on which Account, I haſten'd them to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0717200600:57"/>lay him down in his Bed, adminiſtring ſome Drops of the <hi>Sp. Lavend.</hi> in a little of the <hi>Julep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He continu'd ſenſible all that Day, ſtill crying out of his Head, but at Night was delirous at ſome Times.</p>
            <p>The next Day I perceiv'd the Wound was crude ſtill, and no Sign of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: The turgid Lips turning livid, and a very languid Oſcillation underneath. The whole <hi>Membrane,</hi> ſo far as had been bare, to the very Edges of the fractur'd <hi>Cranium,</hi> was ſtangely huft up or elevated.</p>
            <p>I paſſed my Probe down cautiouſly upon the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> and could feel all round, a pappy <hi>Excreſcens,</hi> which had incarn'd upon the lower <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,</hi> or was formed together with the upper and the adjacent Veſſels, from whence aroſe (upon drawing back my Inſtrument) a ſmall Quantity of Matter.</p>
            <p>I now ventur'd to drop in a little of my <hi>Balſ. Terebinth.</hi> to the Bottom of the Wound, and as to the reſt made up as the Day before</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0717200600:58"/>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the 20th, he grew <hi>comatoſe,</hi> crying faintly now and then, his Head, and dropt aſleep. That Night his <hi>Spaſms</hi> return'd, with which the <hi>Paralytic</hi> Arm was chiefly and ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, The Wound tending to gangreen: which I ſcarrify'd, ſnipping off ſome Part of the Lips at the ſame Time, but had little or no Blood fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing either my Sciſſars or Lancet.</p>
            <p>Seeing now no Advantage to be gained, but only Diſturbance to the Child, I dreſt him for that Time, with a ſomewhat warmer Application, on Account of the Gangreen; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to give neither my ſelf, nor him, any more Trouble.</p>
            <p>That Day and next the <hi>Convulſions</hi> were ſeldom off; and when they were, he was perfectly ſtupid: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indeed he would attempt to ſpeak, but could not.</p>
            <p>However, on the 22d, finding him ſtill alive, I thought it would be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Omiſſion, if I did not inſpect his Wound: And as he lay along, I took off the Dreſſings, found the Lips flabby and ſubſiding, ſo far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0717200600:59"/>to digeſt, that every thing tended to a ſuddenly approaching Death. Having cover'd up his Head again, I took my Leave.</p>
            <p>The next Day, which was the 23d of <hi>May,</hi> I had Notice given me, he was dead.</p>
            <p>Thus did this little <hi>Hero,</hi> of truly Manly Courage, who had ſtruggled under, and got thro' ſo many Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſeemed now in vulgar Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, to have been well and out of danger for a long Time paſt, at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, after Fourſcore and Four Days. And indeed had there been nothing more than the Fracture and Depreſſion (how deſperate ſoever they might ſeem) yet his Cure had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in a much ſhorter Time. But conſidering the large Abſceſs upon the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> its Rupture or Eroſion, from whence there iſſued (as Mr. <hi>H</hi>— can teſtifie) ſome of the outward Subſtance of the <hi>Brain,</hi> 'twas little Wonder <hi>Nature</hi> ſhould ſuccumb and baffle <hi>Art:</hi> But very ſurpriſing, that for three Months Time, whilſt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lay upon this noble Part, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0717200600:60"/>
               <hi>Palſie, Spaſm, Sopor,</hi> nor ſo much as a <hi>Vertigo</hi> ſhould invade; but on the contrary, that the Child ſhould eat, drink and ſleep, as actively tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling about with his Companions, and as ready (if he had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented) to ſtand upon his Head, as any of 'em all.</p>
            <p>I am very confident, I ſhould not have magnify'd my own Judgment, had I ſucceeded in this Cure, which the Gentleman aforeſaid was pleas'd to allow would have been one of the greateſt had been perform'd in <hi>England;</hi> and if ſo, I think I may ſay, <hi>Elſewhere.</hi> As it was, I thought there would intervene ſomewhat worthy of Remark; and accordingly (as I ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally do of rare Caſes) I made this <hi>Ephemeris;</hi> which if it ſhould not furniſh Matter of Inſtruction, as I hope it may, to my younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet will it let him ſee, how near he may come to the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Work, and at laſt meet with Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>The Day after his Death, I took with me a ſmall Capital Saw, and a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0717200600:61"/>diſſecting Knife, and placing the Head to my Advantage, I divided the <hi>Scalp</hi> from the Baſe of the <hi>Occiput,</hi> cloſe by the <hi>Sagittal Suture,</hi> to the Top of the Forehead; then turning it down, together with the <hi>Temporal Muſcle,</hi> which I raiſed at the ſame Time, over the Ear of the wounded Side of the Head: With the back of my Knife I clear'd off the <hi>Pericranium:</hi> And with my Saw, (guided by a Line of Ink I had drawn before-hand, on the Top as well as on that Side,) I got thro' the <hi>Skull;</hi> which being remov'd with the End of my <hi>Spathula,</hi> the right Hemiſphere of the <hi>Brain,</hi> I found would come into View, by only clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi> But before I began to meddle with this latter, having rais'd up the Side of the <hi>Skull,</hi> I took ſpecial Notice of that Part of the <hi>Membrane</hi> which I had formerly divided or cut into, and of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent <hi>Pia Mater</hi> and <hi>Cerebrum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I perceiv'd there had been ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a fibrous Subſtance, but whether ſpringing from the tender <hi>Meninx,</hi> or complicated together of both <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0717200600:62"/>and Veſſels, was not ſo eaſie to determine. Two or three Days before, it ſeem'd to be an Inch thick, but after Death, growing flabby, it parted upon the leaſt Touch, and was fallen off from the upper <hi>Membrane,</hi> tho' here and there continuous with the under one.</p>
            <p>When I had remov'd this interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Body, I expected to find ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Abſceſs upon the Subſtance of the <hi>Brain,</hi> at leaſt upon the <hi>Pia Mater:</hi> Where all that was conſpicuous (an Indication there had been ſuch) were the larger Ramifications of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous Veſſels, upon the Surface of the <hi>Membrane,</hi> whoſe Cavities, inſtead of their naturally contained <hi>Cruor,</hi> were implete with a tranſparent <hi>Pus:</hi> More eſpecially thoſe upon the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior <hi>Lobe,</hi> under the <hi>Os Frontis,</hi> where the <hi>Head-ach</hi> was at firſt, as well as at the laſt, continually pointed to.</p>
            <p>Cutting into the Cortical Part of the <hi>Brain,</hi> I found all free and clear, as in a ſound State: The <hi>Ventricles</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the <hi>Oblong Marrow,</hi> alſo the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0717200600:63"/>
               <hi>Cerebell</hi> were firm, and to the Eye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted.</p>
            <p>Being now minded to take a View of the other Side, I divided the <hi>Falx,</hi> and (without ſawing off that Part of the <hi>Cranium</hi>) with my Hand, brought out the left <hi>Hemiſpheer:</hi> The Veſſels on whoſe Surface, in like Manner with the right, were conſpicuouſly turgid with the ſame Matter, a little of which, here and there, was ſhed upon the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the <hi>Brain:</hi> At the firſt Sight, I thought it might lie on the Outſide of the <hi>Pia Mater;</hi> but going over gently with the Back of my Knife, and wiping alſo with a ſoft Sponge, I found it not removed: So that in ſeveral Places, opening the <hi>Membrane</hi> with the Point of my Lancet, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it lay immediately upon the Subſtance of the <hi>Brain,</hi> and iſſued out thro' each Apertion.</p>
            <p>Having thus far ſatisfy'd my own Curioſity, I placed the <hi>Brain</hi> where I found it, and fitting to, the divided <hi>Skull,</hi> drew over the <hi>Scalp:</hi> which ſtitching up, and with the Point of my Needle raiſingthe ſhort Hair, to cover
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0717200600:64"/>the ſaid Stiches: 'Twas no eaſie Matter for the niceſt Surveyor, to perceive that the <hi>Brain</hi> had been taken out and inſpected, or the <hi>Cranium</hi> med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with: But this only by the bye.</p>
            <p>It may be now expected, I ſhould deſcend to the <hi>AEtiologye,</hi> and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſolve, or mechanically explain the foregoing <hi>Phaenomena:</hi> But as to this, I think I may as well in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral confeſs my Ignorance, as pretend to unfold that, for another Perſon's, which I never could elucidate to my own Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>'Till the Buſineſs of Senſation is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unravell'd, than hitherto it hath been, or I fear will be; die Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Nervous Syſtem</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd, but not clearly demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>Whither there be any ſuch Bodies as the Animal Spirits, is not yet univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally agreed on: That the Source of theſe Diſorders lies ſomewhere in the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and that the Nervous Bodies, thence ariſing, are ſome how or other the <hi>Cauſae ſine qua,</hi> of Motion and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, ſeems inconteſtable. Thus far we may go, and trace out many Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0717200600:65"/>Thus alſo from the bare Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Particles of Matter, as they happen to be this or that Way modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, may we by <hi>Mechanic</hi> Laws ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for ſundry Obſervables in the Animal Structure: But how meer Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which Way ſoever figur'd, can at firſt give, guide, and govern the <hi>Impetus</hi> is unaccountable. 'Tis here that the poor. Twilight of Humane Underſtanding is truly nonpluſt. And what we argue muſt be ſtill <hi>a poſterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri:</hi> We may judge, having afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand diſcovered the Effect produc'd, that the like under ſimilar Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will be brought forth again: Thus, the <hi>Quod ſit,</hi> is apparent, but the <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo,</hi> out of Sight.</p>
            <p>'Tis manifeſt the Blow upon our little Patient's Head, was the remote Cauſe of his Death, by occaſioning a Rupture of ſome of the Veſſels upon the <hi>Brain,</hi> which ſhedding forth their Blood upon this noble Part, did there (being not diſcharg'd) produce an <hi>Apoſteme:</hi> And when the purulent Matter, was, afterwards, imbibed or abſorbed by ſome of the ſaid

            <p>But what theſe putrid Bodies are, which did the Miſchief, or in what their Eſſence does conſiſt, how, or after what Manner, and why they came chiefly to affect the Arm on the contrary Side, how after a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes they brought on a <hi>Paralyſis,</hi> or how the Nervous <hi>Fibres</hi> with the <hi>Tendons</hi> of the <hi>Muſcles,</hi> in that Arm and Leg, came ſo regularly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately to be haled by the direful <hi>Spaſms,</hi> is what I know little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, I might make ſome Noiſe, and talk of venomous Exhalations, or malign and poiſonous <hi>Miaſmata,</hi> which inſinuating into the <hi>Fibres,</hi> like ſo many <hi>Stimuli,</hi> muſt needs twitch and convell thoſe exquiſitely ſenſible, the Nervous Bodies.

            <p>Let the <hi>Adept</hi> in <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> here ſtrut and pride himſelf in his Recourſe to a Mundane Soul, or his Omnipotent Nature: Let him take up with thoſe unintelligible Terms of his <hi>Archaeus,</hi> or his Plaſtic Powers, whilſt I, who never yet ſhook off the Sacred Ties of Religion, and am ſelf conſcious how great a Debtor I am to His Munificence, look up to the prime Architect, the great <gap reason="foreign">

            <head>An Advertiſement to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Reader,</hi> for rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as common an Error.</head>
            <p>WHereas it is uſually reported, that after boring a Hole in the <hi>Skull,</hi> which the <hi>Surgeons</hi> call <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panning,</hi> there is a Silver or Gold Plate fixed into the Hole, out of which the Bone was taken; this is intended to ſatisfie (if poſſible) thoſe over credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous People, that the ſame is a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Abuſe on their Belief: And if ſuch a thing was ever ſeen in the Perforation, it was after preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, by the Perſon concern'd in the roguiſh Fraud.</p>
            <p>It might ſeem amongſt the more reaſonable Part of Mankind, there ſhould be no Need of ſuch an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: Nor had I given my ſelf a Trouble of this Nature (for which I hazard being laught at by every Artiſt) had I not frequently met, as well with thoſe of a diſcerning Faculty enough in other Matters, who had ſwallow'd
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0717200600:81"/>this Deluſion, as with the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived vulgar Apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I was treating my Patient in the preceeding Narration, a Perſon of more Figure indeed, than Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, aſſerted to my Face as the moſt aſſured Truth, that ſhe had ſeen one of theſe Plates in a <hi>Skull</hi> juſt bored. A Second (as cunning as the former) ſtrenuouſly avouched that her own Husband, upon an Accident having undergone this Operation, had a Plate ſhe ſee put in, and which many Years after, he carry'd with him to his Grave.</p>
            <p>A By-ſtander looking over others Shoulders, whilſt I was laying a Piece of white <hi>Sarſnet,</hi> into the Hole made in the Child's <hi>Skull,</hi> which we call a <hi>Syndon,</hi> (and which I verily believe hath often contributed to this vulgar Errour) went away, and reported he had ſeen the Plate fix'd in.</p>
            <p>Now if they conſider what Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance they meet with, if any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Body be thruſt into the Fleſh, which has no Quiet 'till remov'd, or 'till the Place apoſtemates or feſters,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0717200600:82"/>and throws it out: They would ſee the Impoſſibility of this Plate's uniting with, or growing to the Bone, where it cannot lie long, without putrifying the Fleſh, rotting the <hi>Skull,</hi> and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in upon the <hi>Brain:</hi> But if ſome Practitioners have been ſo baſe, as to contribute to this egregious Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on Mankind, 'tis not ſtrange that the People ſhould ſpread the Rumour, and deceive one another.</p>
            <p>Thus I was told by a <hi>Surgeon</hi> uſed to the Sea (too many of whom are apt to take the Traveller's Authority) who openly acknowledg'd, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Neceſſity of a Gold Plate (which he put in, and after convey'd away) to fill up the Hole in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Head, he had got more from him, than he could afterwards, for his Cure.</p>
            <p>Farther, that we-may ſee the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Prevalency of ſpreading Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. One of my own Patients, as I have been inform'd, that ſhe might appear the greater Object, of their Wonder, tho' ſhe knew every Time ſhe told her Story, ſhe was telling a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0717200600:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>Lye of the firſt Magnitude: would often aſſert, ſhe carry'd one of theſe Plates in her Head; neither wanted ſhe for Vouchers, amongſt ſuch as fancy'd they could plainly feel it.</p>
            <p>To put a final Stop therefore to this Errour, ſo far at leaſt as this Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reacheth, and farther to gratiſie the Inquiſitive, who may want to be informed how the Hole is filled up: They are to conceive, that a new Fleſh is engender'd after few Days up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Skin that covers the <hi>Brain:</hi> and raiſeth it ſelf up even (by the Help of Art) to the outer Edge of the <hi>Skull,</hi> where ſoon after it hardens into what the <hi>Surgeons</hi> call a <hi>Callus,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Callus</hi> skin'd over, in ſome longer Time, becoming as hard as any other Part of the <hi>Skull</hi> it ſelf. For the Truth of which, let the ſtill doubting, apply, themſelves to their own <hi>Surgeon.</hi>
