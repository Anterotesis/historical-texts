            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HOPE you will be ſo juſt unto me, as not to think I gave over writing unto you during the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Parliament, becauſe I did not in a good while receive an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto my firſt letter. I ſeldom ſtand upon ſuch ceremonies, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with thoſe who have obliged me, as you have done. The truth is, ſome of your friends, and mine, were ſo entangled in buſineſs then upon the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0586502400:4"/>
ſtage, that I could ſay nothing to the purpoſe, without mentioning them; and the parts they had taken upon themſelves, were ſuch as I was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to relate. The reſult of all this is, that the Lord Sunderland is out of his place and the Council: The Lord Conway ſucceeds him, and hath the Seals. Eſſex is alſo put out of the Council and Lieutenancy of Hartford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, upon preſenting a Petition from the Lords. Godolphin hoped to have had the Honour of accompanying them in their diſgrace; but Temple only hath it. The Council being hereby weakened, is reinforced by the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Earls of Oxford, Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field and Ayleſbury; and it is hoped that, to render it compleat, the Lords Berkeley, Craven and Arundel of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0586502400:5"/>
ſhall be called. The Lord Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax is gone to ruminate upon theſe matters at Rufford, and ſays he will not return ſouthward, until the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament meet at Oxford. The fruits expected from the laſt Parliament hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been loſt by little underhand bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains, and, as ſome ſay, the King and Parliament equally betrayed by thoſe that were truſted by them, men's minds ſeem to be filled with various conceits, and many jealouſies. Some think, the Writs for calling the Parliament are in themſelves void, as being without advice of Council; and that the Law takes notice of nothing done by the King, <hi>ſine ſapientum &amp; magnatum conſilio:</hi> Or that if it ſhould meet at Oxford, its Acts would be void, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be vacated for want of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0586502400:6"/>
of voting, which is eſſential unto it. Others ſay, the validity of the Writs depends ſolely upon the <hi>perſon</hi> of the King, and that others ought to think themſelves ſafe, where he is ſafe, though their danger be from him. I know not what this will produce, but I never ſaw men's minds more heated than at preſent; and cannot think that portends leſs evil than the <hi>Comet.</hi> People are every where buſy in chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parliament Men of their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and they will probably be like unto the laſt; but it is thought, many Officers will be prevailed with to make <hi>falſe returns.</hi> I hear of no Election paſſed, but that of <hi>Amerſham:</hi> Of thoſe who by the laſt Parliament were there judged capable of giving their voices, Sir Robert Hill had forty; Mr.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0586502400:7"/>
Sydney ſeven and thirty; Sir Joſeph Drake twenty eight; Mr. Cheyney twenty nine; but the Conſtables have been pleaſed to return the two latter. To-morrow is appointed for the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>City-Members,</hi> who, people believe, will be the ſame as formerly. Some think his Royal Highneſs hath buſineſs enough to employ his thoughts: Others ſay he is at ſuch perfect leiſure, that the Maid of Honour, who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him, cannot employ all his ſpare time; and for that reaſon, or to give her time to lay aſide ſomething that troubled her, he applys himſelf to a young Gentlewoman, who with much reſpect, and gratitude, receives the honour he is pleaſed to do her; but ſhe hath an old crabbed Huſband, who doth not take that for a juſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0586502400:8"/>
of the great reſpect he hath ſhewed unto his Royal Highneſs, and is not like to learn better manners from his Preſbyterian Bretheren.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding what is ſaid, we good Subjects hope all will go perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well. His Majeſty, as is ſaid, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves ſo to reform his Court, that all ſhall be of one Mind. Mr. Seymour being now looked upon as the greateſt man, brings his two friends Conway and Ranelagh into the management of buſineſs; and the firſt of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as eminent for fineſſe of Wit, quickneſs and eaſineſs in ſtate affairs, as the other in the excellency of all moral Virtues, things cannot but go well; and we particularly hope that England will keep up its reputation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0586502400:9"/>
of being, as the Cardinal Pallavicini ſays, the <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Nurſe of the beſt Wits in the World,</hi> when all foreign Miniſters ſhall come to treat with Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins and Conway, who will be taken for patterns of the Genius of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not thought the only men it produceth, that deſerve the higheſt praiſes; and leſt any thing ſhould be wanting, Mr. Hide is joined unto theſe. It is true that we have not of our Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, a man to put at the head of the Soldiers, as admirable in military ſkill, and virtues, as thoſe above-mentioned are in civils and morals: But the knowledge of our own defects, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity of diſcovering in the Earl of Feverſham the qualities which we have not, and the prudent humility of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting unto him that is bleſſed with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0586502400:10"/>
them, though a ſtranger, deſerves ſome commendations: And I am confident, that when things ſhall be brought into ſuch order, that a Papiſt may appear open-faced, we ſhall ſhew as great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the Lord Dunbarton. France and Germany, that are full of their Trophies, cannot but admire this, whilſt we reſt ſecure under their ſhadow. Fit men may more eaſily be found for leſs eminent Places; and the Earl of Thanet, as is ſaid, ſhall ſucceed Mr. Ruſſell in the Command of the Foot Guards. Civil and military affairs being thus ſettled, Treaſures flowing in unto us on all ſides, and all Foreign Princes, concerned in our affairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſure unto us; we need not fear a few <hi>diſcontented Lords,</hi> a <hi>mutinous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or <hi>murmuring Counties;</hi> and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0586502400:11"/>
preſuming that the vaſt magazines of arms made at Breſt, and ſome that with a good quantity of ammunition, were lately ſent into Ireland, are in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of agreements made with you, we cannot but think all will tend to our good.</p>

            <p>I HOPE you will excuſe the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I give you, in encloſing this, and deſire you to ſend it forward into Gaſcoiney. It is a climate where I cannot be ſuſpected of ſending any thing of a dangerous nature; but we have ſo many at the Poſt-Houſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the moſt impertinent folly, that a Pacquet though directed thither can hardly paſs unviſited, unleſs the Perſon to whom it is directed do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect it.</p>
            <p>The laſt Reſolutions of the City, have been as pleaſing to the Countie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0586502400:13"/>
as diſtaſtful to the Court. Yeſterday the Company of Artillery intended to have choſen Prince Rupert to be their Captain, and Sir Thomas Player their Leader; but a letter was produced from the King, rather deſiring than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that no new Officers ſhould be choſen; and they having no Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beyond an Act of King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, depending upon his Majeſty's Will, did unwillingly obey.</p>
            <p>Parliament-Men are for the moſt part choſen by the Parties moſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Court, and many believe this next Houſe of Commons will not be at all more pliable than the laſt. Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Waller and Poultney were this day choſen at Weſtminſter without any oppoſition. Col. Titus and Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0586502400:14"/>
Proby were with the ſame facility choſen Knights of Huntingtonſhire; Hambden the elder, and Wharton, of Buckinghamſhire; with a multitude of others.</p>
            <p>The Lady Portſmouth is ſaid to have entirely recovered her loſt favour. The Earl of Sunderland is at his Houſe in Queen-Street. The Lady Hallifax, on Tueſday, followed her Lord to Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>BEING conſcious unto my ſelf, that what I could ſay of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes now upon the Stage would be of little uſe unto you, I thought it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me to be one of the laſt in writing to you, than to take place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my deſire of ſerving you, which would ſuffer me to yield to none; but leſt this acknowledgment ſhould be taken for a pretence to cover lazineſs, I will here give you ſuch a ſight of things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I have; and intend to continue to do the like as often as I can without troubling you. You will
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0586502400:16"/>
have heard from all hands, what tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the Houſe of Commons appears to be of, and that the Earl of Danby hath accompliſhed his promiſe of bringing it into an entire ſubjection unto the King's Will, as well as the other two points, of paying his Majeſty's Debts, encreaſing his Treaſure, and rendering him conſiderable amongſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes; which are verified in leaving twenty two Shillings and ten pence in the Exchequer, two and forty hundred thouſand Pounds of paſſive debts, and the revenue anticipated for almoſt a Year and half, and the account his Lordſhip was pleaſed to give in his ſpeech to the Peers, of the eſteem the King of France had for his perſon and government. Notwithſtanding all this, he is ſo far conſidered at Court, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0586502400:17"/>
his concernments are a general ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to all buſineſſes. The Lord Berckely, Frécheville, and others of the learned, think he hath behaved himſelf ſo well, as to deſerve no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore oppoſed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment of the Bill of Attainder, that it might be caſt out: Shaftſbury, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex and Halifax differing ſomething in opinion from them, in compliance unto the King's deſires, did, as an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wipe out the word <hi>Attainder,</hi> and made it almoſt the ſame with that which their Lordſhips had formerly ſent up to baniſh him, and declaring him attainted only if he came into England after the firſt of May next: The conſideration of which buſineſs, is likely this day to poſſeſs the Houſe of Commons, and if their mind be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0586502400:18"/>
known before this letter be ſealed, it ſhall be inſerted.</p>
            <p>The next important point likely to be purſued is, to proſecute the laſt week's Vote, that <hi>all the Forces now on foot in</hi> England, <hi>except the trained Bands, were kept up contrary to Law;</hi> and though it was objected that the King's Guards, and the Garriſons of Portſmouth and other places would be included; it was anſwered, that <hi>Kings governing juſtly according to</hi> Law, <hi>had no need of</hi> Cuſtodia Corporis; and that it was better to have no Garriſons at all, than ſuch as were commanded by Leg, Holmes, and their Peers.</p>
            <p>The controverſy concerning the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection at Grinſtead, was determined
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0586502400:19"/>
at the Committee in favour of Mr. Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, choſen by the Commons, and Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Pelham, by the major part of the Corporation, no complaint being made againſt him. Powell chooſing to ſtand as he is choſen for Ciciter, the diſpute upon the new Election is like to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Skrog and Sir Thomas Littleton, who is like to have the aſſiſtance of the Dorſet Family, the Pelhams, and ſome others. On Friday laſt, the ſame Committee voted the Right of Election at Windſor to be in the Commons; and that <hi>Ernely</hi> and his Companion hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been unduly choſen by the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, a new Election ſhould be made; but the Houſe approving of the firſt part only, annulled the Election of Ernely and the other, and approved that of Winhood and Storkey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0586502400:20"/>
All <hi>Foreign Affairs</hi> are at a ſtand, only Van Beuninghen takes great pains to make people believe the King of France intends to add England unto his other Conqueſts, and diſabuſe ſuch as were ſo fooliſh as to believe there was any thing of truth in the reports of thoſe that had ſpoken of the Popiſh Plot; and finding me infected with the ſame opinion, with ſome of my Friends, he was pleaſed to ſpend two hours the other day in the Park to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of my error, in which he did ſucceed as well as he uſed to do in his great deſigns.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> certainly inclines not to be ſo ſtiff as formerly in advancing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe that exalt <hi>Prerogative;</hi> but the Earl of Eſſex, and ſome others that

            <p>The Houſe of Commons have this day preſented unto the Lords, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles drawn againſt the five Lords in the Tower. I alſo hear juſt now, that they do adhere to the Bill of Attainder of the Earl of Danby, and will no ways admit of the Lords amendments of it. One <hi>Reading,</hi> a Lawyer, not long ſince offered four thouſand pounds, and three hundred pounds a year in Land to <hi>Bedloe,</hi> if he would diſavow the teſtimony he had given againſt the Lords of Powys, Bellaſſys and Peters; which being communicated unto Prince
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0586502400:23"/>
Robert, and Earl of Eſſex, he brought Reading by their advice into a place, where two Witneſſes heard him; whereupon Reading was apprehended, and he having found means whilſt he was in the Serjeant's hands to ſend a Letter to his Wife, to be delivered to Mr. Chyvins, (deſiring to be admitted to the King's Preſence, promiſing to tell great matters) his Majeſty refers him wholly to the Houſe of Commons, and offers to iſſue out a Commiſſion of Oyer and Terminer for his Trial, which will be very ſpeedy, if he ſave not himſelf by diſcoveries: This Morning a Letter was intercepted written to him by his Wife, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe tells him, that every body ſays he is a Rogue, and if he doth

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU are ſo much afore-hand in obliging me, when I moſt want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a friend, that I cannot hope in a long time to pay my debt, though I were in a place that gave me more advantages, than any I can ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect; but you may ever be ſure of all that is within my reach. I write now in ſome haſte, but am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing this Poſt ſhould go without a Letter from me. I preſume you know that the Earl of Danby rendered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Black Rod, on Wedneſday laſt; and that deſiring of the Lords at
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0586502400:26"/>
the Bar, that for his health he might be ſuffer'd to continue under his Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody: That he might have recourſe, as often as occaſion ſhould require, to all State Papers, that were neceſſary to him in making his defence: That he might at once have a Copy of all his Charge, and be obliged not to anſwer to any part, until the whole were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: And that he might have Serjeant Weſton, Serjeant Raymond, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Holt aſſigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for Counſel. He received no other anſwer, than that if he told what Papers he deſired, the Houſe would do as was uſual in thoſe caſes: That the Houſe of Commons could not be abridged of the liberty retained to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, of bringing in additional charges, if it were thought fit: That he might
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0586502400:27"/>
have for his Counſel, ſuch of thoſe he had named as were not of the King's: And that he muſt be committed to the Tower, where Cheeke received him. Subtle men find great myſteries in his rendering himſelf, and make the King to be of the Plot; but thoſe that ſee no farther than I, believe he hath had in this, and all his buſineſſes of late, no other Counſel than his Lady.</p>
            <p>You will perhaps be ſurpriz'd to hear, that yeſterday the King did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſſolve his Old Privy Council, and choſe a new one, conſiſting of fifteen Officers of the Crown, ten Lords, and five Commoners; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty retaining unto himſelf the liberty of naming a Preſident, calling ſuch Princes of the Blood, as ſhould be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0586502400:28"/>
from time to time; and the Secretary of Scotland for the time being, if he thought fit; declaring moreover, that whenſoever any Place ſhould be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, he would name none without the advice of the Council; and that the Perſon named ſhould be called by a Letter ſubſcribed by them all. To which he was pleaſed to add, That he would have no <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>principal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> no Committee of Foreign af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, or Cabinet Council; but that in all things he would follow and rely upon their advice, next unto that of his Great Council, the Parliament, which was alſo ſpecified in the letter ſent by his Majeſty for the calling of every one of them, who are now to ſerve in Council. The Officers, who by their places are to be of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0586502400:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(as I remember) are the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, Chief Juſtice, Privy Seal, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Steward, Arlington Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, Suſſex, as firſt Commiſſioner of the Treaſury, Sir Henry Capell as firſt Commiſſioner of the Admiralty, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Archbiſhop of Canterbury and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of London, the two Secretaries, and ſome others that I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got; but Newport and Mainard are none. The Lords are, the Dukes of Newcaſtle and Albemarle, the Marqueſſes of Wincheſter and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Earls of Bridgewater and Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Viſcounts Faulconbridge and Halifax, Barons Roberts and Hollys; Commoners are, the Lords Ruſſel and Cavendiſh, Mr. Powell, Mr. Seymour, and (as I hear) Sir William Temple.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0586502400:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I hear alſo ſeven Commiſſioners nam'd for the Admiralty, Sir Henry Capell, Merres, Littleton, Vaughan, Mr. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel Finch, and two others, that I have forgotten. The Lord Shaftſbury is declared Preſident of the Council. Theſe were ſworn this morning, and that Ceremony being performed, the King went to the houſe of Lords, and ſent for the houſe of Commons, to whom he did impart all that had paſſed; and all that I have yet ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with, ſeem much pleaſed; though it might have been wiſhed, that ſome of thoſe that are choſen had been left out. A friend <note n="*" place="bottom">Marqueſs of Halifax, Earls of Sunderland and Eſſex. See Letter of May the 12th, p.</note>of yours and mine is, as far as I underſtand, the author of all this; and if he and two more can

well agree amongſt themſelves, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they will have the management of almoſt all buſineſſes, and may bring much honour to themſelves, and good to our nation.</p>
            <p>I find men's hearts much ſet upon taking the Government of Ireland out of the Earl of Ormond's hands. If a Lieutenant be named, I believe it will be Eſſex or Halifax; and, if neither of them, three Juſtices.</p>
            <p>Others deſign Halifax ſucceſſor to his unkle Coventry. You will perhaps wonder, not to hear his brother Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam mentioned; but as yet there is no occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>We have every day fooliſh alarms
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0586502400:32"/>
from the French Fleet, and I find no body but the Lord Sunderland and myſelf that believe not one word of it. Morgan, Governor of Jerſey, is dead, and Laheer appointed to ſucceed him. That our affairs may be managed by as able a man abroad as that iſland is defended by, Sir H. Goodrike expects in a few days to be diſpatched for Spain. We do not yet ſee what effect the death of the King of Sweden will have as to the peace of Europe. I received the good piece of Poetry, that I ſent you, from the Lord Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax.

            <p>ON this day was a ſe'nnight, I writ unto you what I had heard of the paſſages of the foregoing week; and though I make no doubt, but you have many that give you far better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of what is done than I am able to do, I will not make that an excuſe for ſilence, leſt others ſhould alledge the ſame, and covering true lazineſs with fained modeſty, leave you in the dark, as my friends did me when I was abroad.</p>
            <p>The five Popiſh Lords in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, had at the firſt given in cavilling
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0586502400:35"/>
uncertain anſwers; but Bellaſſys and Peters on Thurſday, and Powys, Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and Arundell on Saturday, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ambiguity, pleaded <hi>not guilty,</hi> and declared they put themſelves upon the Lords Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The Earl of Danby hath not thought fit, as yet, to deal ſo clearly, but hath put in a huge long anſwer, containing great proteſtations of his own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, as to every part of his charge; and then pleads his pardon, which enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates and acquits him of all the crimes, that it is almoſt poſſible for a man to commit. This is by ſome thought very ſtrange; his Innocence that he proteſts, declaring that he had no need of Pardon, and the Pardon pleaded in effect acknowledging the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0586502400:36"/>
truth of his Charge; it being uſeleſs if he be not guilty. Hereupon other queſtions do ariſe, as whether the King can pardon? Whether if he have this power, he hath rightly executed it, the formalities not having been obſerved? And laſtly, whether he will inſiſt upon this anſwer, which will not leave him any plea at all, if the pardon be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed defective? I dare give no opinion upon theſe points, but I hear the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſay, <hi>the</hi> King <hi>cannot pardon a man impeached by Parliament upon a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick account:</hi> That though he could, this would be of no value, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in all the formalities: And though perhaps the Court may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent enough in the houſe of Lords, to have it admitted; that would be of evil conſequence, no man doubting but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0586502400:37"/>
the houſe of Commons will extremely diſlike ſuch a Judgment, and grow very refractory thereupon; and the whole Nation would follow them in it, ſo as all buſineſs would be thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; by which means the King, upon the perſonal account of the Earl of Danby, would loſe the advantage of all that hath been done of late to pleaſe the Nation; which I leave to your Judgment, that know the Court much better than I do. This point I only find to be clear, that if the Pardon can be found good, though the formalities are wanting, it will be made good; and the burthen left upon the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, that put the great Seal unto it, without taking care of ſeeing them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0586502400:38"/>
Some Judges were yeſterday put out; Wild for inability of body, and Barton and Thurland of mind, with ſome others; to whom old Ellys, Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond and Pemmerton, Leake and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins the younger are to ſucceed. The houſe of Lords is buſy upon one Bill concerning Popery, and the houſe of Commons upon another, both inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find a way of diſtinguiſhing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants only from Papiſts, but cannot yet reſolve upon it, ſo as to include the ſeveral diſſenting Sects; that Papiſts may not be ſheltered, and receive the indulgence (which is not intended them) under other Names; and this difficulty is chiefly occaſioned by the Quakers, who, for more than one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are thought leaſt to deſerve much to be cared for. Shaftſbury and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0586502400:39"/>
are eminent in pleading for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to tender-conſcienced Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and ſeverity againſt Papiſts: The firſt of theſe ſaid the other day, <q>he neither could live <hi>with</hi> or <hi>under</hi> a <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
               </q> On Saturday it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the houſe of Commons, that the Lord Cottington, who died many years ago in Spain, had appointed an Epitaph to be written upon his Tomb, expreſſing his deſire, that his body might reſt there until England were reſtored to the Church, and then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried over: This it was the laſt year, and a Warrant was produced from the Earl of Danby to the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms to let it paſs.</p>
            <p>Yeſterday was appointed extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary by the houſe of Commons, to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0586502400:40"/>
conſider of the ſucceſſion of the Crown in relation to Popery, upon the debate of which Secretary Coventry, amongſt other things, is ſaid to have reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Birch, that his diſcourſes ſavoured of the Years 1640 and 41, but that himſelf continued in the ſame mind he had ever been; and having taken the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy to the King and his Succeſſors, could not without Perjury fail of performing the contents of them to his Succeſſor, what Religion ſoever he ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be of. Unto which Birch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, aſſerting his own ſervices to the King; taxing Coventry of having broken his word to the Parliament twice the laſt year, in relation to a War promiſed to be declared and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually made upon France; diſſerved
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0586502400:41"/>
the King and Nation, in having been a principal cauſe of breaking the triple League; and concluded, he was as fit to be turn'd out of the Council as any one that had been ſo. Bennet not long before had ſaid, that though this Council ſeemed in ſome degree to be reformed, no good could reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be expected, as long as one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in it, who did by ſuch violences and other undue ways advance Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power in Scotland, and one that had maſſes daily ſaid for him in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: For the firſt of theſe he named Latherdale, and left the houſe in an opinion, that for the other he meant Angleſey. At the laſt it was conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the King ſhould be deſired to give order for the execution of Picker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and another condemned Prieſt;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0586502400:42"/>
that a Proclamation ſhould be iſſued to baniſh all Papiſts without any other exceptions than publick Miniſters, and their followers, twenty miles out of London: The Lady Portſmouth was named, but not purſued: That the Duke of York being a Papiſt, the hopes of his ſucceeding unto the Crown had been the principal ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Plot againſt the King's life and the Proteſtant Religion: That the ſecret Committee ſhould, on Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday next, bring into the Houſe ſuch Letters and Papers as they had in their hands relating unto the ſaid Duke. The concurrence of the Lords is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, as to the Proclamation, and the firſt vote concerning the Duke; and the Lord Ruſſell, notwithſtanding his being a Privy Counſellor, appointed to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0586502400:43"/>
carry up the Meſſage. They alſo voted an addreſs to be made to the King, that all Sea-ports, places of ſtrength, and command of Ships may be put into truſty hands, and concluded to refer the farther conſideration of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Wedneſday next, and I believe it will be then debated, whether ſuch an Aſſociation ſhall be entered into as was appointed in Queen Elizabeth's time; or an Act made, that this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhould not determine in ſuch a time as ſhould be limited, though the King ſhould die, or in ſo many months after, or ſomething to that purpoſe, which may tend to the King's ſecurity. I do not well know what the Houſes have done this Morning, but hear the Meſſage from the houſe of Commons is carried up to the Lords, and that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0586502400:44"/>
they have appointed the Earl of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be at their Bar to-morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Commons have alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected their Bill for diſbanding of the Army, by a Land-Tax of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds the month, ſubſequent to that which will expire in February next. Several Prieſts were taken the laſt night, of which two confeſs they were ſent over by all means to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to invalidate Oates and Bedloe's teſtimony. Reading was this morning in the Pillory, and is condemned to a year's impriſonment and 1000 pounds fine, for having endeavoured to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Bedloe. Stubbs, the Counteſs of Shrewſbury's Butler, confeſſeth he had been induced by three Prieſts, to gain as many Servants as he could, to ſet

            <p>THOUGH the laſt week was ſpent rather in wrangling than the diſpatch of any buſineſs of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I continue to give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what I hear, becauſe theſe irregular motions are often the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of great matters; and as they denote the temper of a Nation, they give good grounds of gueſſing what they will end in. I do not ſend you the King and Chancellor's ſpeeches, becauſe I preſume care was taken to ſend them to you by the laſt poſt; but perhaps others have not been ſo free in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0586502400:47"/>
telling you the effect of it as I ſhall be. The Courtiers did believe, that the King's yielding that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould not end with his life, or be revived by his death, if it chanced to be diſſolved in his life-time, and have the nomination of all Officers, both civil and military, if his Succeſſor proved to be a Papiſt, would have given entire ſatisfaction unto the houſe of Commons. But to the contrary it is certain, that the ſuppoſition that the next in blood muſt be King, though a Papiſt, is ſo diſtaſtful to them, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will pleaſe upon that odious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and as to this particular, it is looked upon as a trick to bring the Parliament to confeſs and confirm the Duke's title, that is, a little gilding to cover a poiſonous pill. This puts them
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0586502400:48"/>
upon various counſels; ſome would <hi>impeach</hi> him, upon what is diſcovered of his part in the Plot: Others incline more to bring in an Act, to <hi>exclude</hi> him from the ſucceſſion of the Crown, as being a Papiſt, and thereby a friend unto and dependent upon, a foreign and enemy Power. Some of thoſe that are of this mind, look <q>
                  <hi>who is fitteſt to ſucceed,</hi> if this ſhould be; and they are for the moſt part <hi>divided between</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> hath plainly the moſt <hi>plauſible title,</hi> by his <hi>Mother</hi> and his Wife; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the opinion of the influence it is believed the Duke of York would have over him, it is feared that the <hi>Commonwealth-party</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> would be ſo frighted with that, as to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0586502400:49"/>
caſt itſelf abſolutely into the hands of the <hi>King of France,</hi> who might thereby have a fair occaſion of ruining both England and Holland.</q> I need not tell you the reaſons <hi>againſt</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth; but the ſtrongeſt I hear alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>for</hi> him, are, that whoſoever is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to York, will have a good party, and all Scotland, which is every day like to be in arms, doth certainly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him, <q>and may probably be of as much importance in the troubles that are now likely to fall upon us, as they were in the beginning of the laſt.</q> Others are only upon nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. But when I have ſaid what I can upon this buſineſs, I muſt confeſs I do not know three men of a mind, and that a ſpirit of giddineſs reigns amongſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0586502400:50"/>
us, far beyond any I have ever obſerved in my life.</p>
            <p>Nothing was done the laſt week con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Popiſh Lords in the Tower. The Earl of Danby on Saturday laſt did inſiſt upon his former plea and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, how little ſenſe ſoever there be in it. ſome ſay it is, <hi>ex induſtria per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexa;</hi> and that having the Court and houſe of Lords to favour him, he cares not for the inconſiſtence of proteſting his innocence, which renders his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don uſeleſs, and pleading his pardon, which is a confeſſion of guilt; hoping that if the Commons do demur in Law upon the two points, (firſt, that the King cannot pardon a Delinquent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached by one Commoner, much leſs by all the Commons in England;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0586502400:51"/>
ſecondly, that though it were granted he might pardon, this pardon could not hold, becauſe it wants all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities) the Lords would over-rule it, and then he is acquitted.</p>
            <p>The Bill for the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> was paſſed by the Lords on Friday laſt, and ſent down to the Commons. The ſame day they alſo paſſed an Act for the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of the Papiſts out of London, and penned it ſo well by the induſtry of the Biſhops, that if the Commons ſhould paſs it without amendment, all the Non-conformiſts of London would be driven out of town, and half the ſhops ſhut up. The Bill for diſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Army is paſſed the two Houſes, and I preſume will not ſtay long for the Royal aſſent. The Lords did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0586502400:52"/>
to the vote of the Commons, that the Duke being a Papiſt, had been the occaſion of the Plot, but added the word, <hi>unwillingly.</hi> The whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs formerly mentioned of the Earl of Danby his endeavour to ſuborn Bedloe to renounce his teſtimony, was the laſt week verified before a Committee of Lords, and Dumblain his man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he had been employed to do it; ſo as his Lordſhip is found to have done juſt the ſame thing, for which <hi>Reading</hi> ſtood the laſt week in the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory. Some Scholars ſent from St. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's were lately apprehended by Sir William Waller, and confeſs they are ſent hither by the Jeſuits, by any means to invalidate Oates and Bedloe's teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but they rather confirm them.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0586502400:53"/>
out of the houſe of Commons, is by Writ called to the houſe of Lords. Sir John Hartup, who petitioned againſt him, is, upon the invalidating of his Election, choſen by the Freeholders of the County, and took his place in the Houſe on Friday. This day is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the new Election in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, and it is thought Sir John Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert will have the ſame ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Sir, I deſire you to tell Monſieur de Ruvygny the younger, that upon his recommendation I did addreſs the Duke de Gramont's <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to the places where all the beſt horſes in England were to be had; but he has rid four hundred miles, and is returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out liking any. To ſay the truth, he is ſuch a proud aſs, that he neither
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0586502400:54"/>
knows what is good, nor will believe any body elſe. I had directed him to ſee two, that are ſaid to be as fine young horſes of five years old as any are in England, which having never been trained were fat, and as he ſaid, <hi>trop relever.</hi> Near Lincoln he ſaw two of the Lord Caſtletown's, which had the ſame faults. At the Lord Burlington's in Yorkſhire he ſaw one, that is thought to be worth as much as any one in England, bred of an Arabian, ſix years old paſſed, never run but once at Kippling, and then won the Plate; and being now thin, and drawn for another courſe, he is to run within this week, this wiſe Gentleman took him for a Mazette: He did the like with ſome others in the ſame place and at the Marqueſs of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0586502400:55"/>
Wincheſter's; upon all which I have no more to ſay to Monſ. Ruvygny, than that he ſhould find a way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive Bucephalus, or ſend a man that hath more wit than this, to take ſuch as the world affords.</p>
            <p>The horrible reports made from France of poiſoning, affright reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſons here, as much as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the fleet at Breſt do fools.</p>
            <p>The houſe of Commons have voted, that the pardon pretended by the Earl of Danby was of no value, and went up to deſire juſtice upon him of the houſe of Lords. We live in a time that no man, by what is paſſed, can well judge what is to be expected for the future; but I am much inclined
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0586502400:56"/>
to believe, that Danby having in this laſt act followed his own diſpoſition, that ever delighted in juggling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directneſs, will, by the tricks he hath played, have found a way to hang himſelf. It is ſaid, that the King will be at the Houſe to-morrow, in his Robes, to paſs the act for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding the Army. This morning, Secretary Coventry not being well, the Lord Ruſſel from the King declared unto the houſe of Commons, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no ſupply from them this ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but deſired care might be taken of the Navy.</p>

            <p>I HAVE received your Letter of May 13, and continue my cuſtom of giving you once a Week an account of what comes to my knowledge, though to diſcourage me I can only make the unpleaſant relations of ſuch diſorders here, as in my opinion threaten us with the greateſt miſchiefs, that can befall a Nation.

The laſt week was ſpent for the moſt part in janglings between the two Houſes, upon <hi>points of Privilege</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating unto the Rights the Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto in points of <hi>Judicatories;</hi> which the Lords Frecheville, Berckely, Ferrers, Ayleſbury, Northampton, and ſome others equal unto them in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, eloquence and reputation, do with the help of the Biſhops very magnanimouſly defend. Several pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals have been made by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of conferring with them upon all the points in queſtion, or appointing a Committee of both Houſes, which, meeting together, might adjuſt all thoſe that might be occaſion of difference; but their Lordſhips diſdaining to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon points that as they did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe depended wholly upon their Will,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0586502400:59"/>
on Friday laſt did vote that they would have no ſuch Committee, which vote was carried only by two voices, the one ſide having 54, the other 52. Of eighteen Biſhops that were preſent, ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen were on the victorious ſide, and only Durham and Carliſle were ſo humble as to join with the vanquiſhed. Of thoſe 52, one and fifty the next day proteſted, and I think only lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hindered the Earl of Leiceſter, who was the other, not to proteſt, as well as the others with whom he had voted. On Saturday there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the two Houſes upon this buſineſs, and it appearing that all proceedings would ſtop thereupon, it being impoſſible for two to agree upon any thing, unleſs their thoughts and reaſons are communicated, they were
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0586502400:60"/>
pleaſed yeſterday to recede from that vote, and appointed a Committee of twelve Lords to confer with a double number of Commons thereupon.</p>
            <p>The houſe of Commons have made an addreſs unto his Majeſty, deſiring him to remove the Duke of Latherdale out of all employments in England and Ireland, and from his preſence for ever; to which they received a dilatory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop of St. Andrew's hath been lately murther'd in his coach three miles from St. Andrew's, by ten men, that there ſet upon him, of which two were taken by ſome horſe that came ſuddenly to the place. It is not known who they are, nor
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0586502400:61"/>
who employed them; but Latherdale is graciouſly pleaſed to lay it upon the Nonconformiſts, and hath thereupon cauſed a very ſevere Proclamation to be iſſued out againſt them: But others believe it was upon a private quarrel with ſome Gentlemen, that by fraud and power the Prelate had thrown out of their eſtates, he having been moſt remarkable for outragious covetouſneſs, beſides other Epiſcopal qualities.</p>
            <p>The houſe of Commons have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden all Commoners of England to be of Counſel to the Earl of Danby, under the pain of being eſteemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of the rights of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by whom he is accuſed, unleſs leave be aſked and given by them.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0586502400:62"/>
The Bill for <hi>disbanding the Army</hi> is paſſed. On Saturday the King hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed ſixteen ſmall pieces of Ordnance to be ſent to Portſmouth, notice was taken thereof in the houſe of Commons, and a great ſuſpicion, that they being ſent with field-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, harneſſes for horſes, and all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries belonging to the train of a marching Army, they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended rather for ſuch an uſe, than to furniſh a Garriſon as is pretended. At the ſame time reports were ſpread, that the Duke of York was returned into England, or hourly expected, and ſome believe his buſineſs is to hinder the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding of the Army, with ſuch others as the knowledge of his nature, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the perſons that command in Portſmouth, the Iſle of Wight, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0586502400:63"/>
ſome other places may ſuggeſt, in the moſt jealous time that I have ever liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in.</p>
            <p>The houſe of Commons ſate yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, being Sunday, to hear ſuch papers read, as the ſecret Committee thought fit to produce relating to the <hi>Duke of York,</hi> which had been found amongſt the Cardinal of Norfolk's papers, and other places. They are many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which ſpeak of his aſſenting unto and approving of the Plot in all points, but none directed to him, or written by him. Many various motions were made, but in the end it was ordered, that a Bill ſhould be drawn up, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar him from the <hi>Succeſſion of the Crown.</hi> Sir Francis Winnington and Mr. Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghan would have put off the debate,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0586502400:64"/>
until the trial oſ Danby and the Popiſh Lords was over. Sir William Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Sir Thomas Littleton, and others, ſpoke directly againſt the thing, but the major part by much was of the other opinion, ſo as on the diviſion appointed upon the queſtion, whether there ſhould be Candles, the inequality was ſo great, that the pains of telling was ſpared, and when the main que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was put, there was no diviſion at all. Not to trouble you with many particulars, I will only recite one, which is, that a Gentleman moving the words ſhould be put in, <q>Or ever had been a Papiſt,</q> they were laid aſide, as ſome believe, in reſpect unto him, who by the direction of the late Lord Crofts, was brought up under the diſcipline of the Peres de l'Oratorie. The next work
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0586502400:65"/>
was to make an addreſs to his Majeſty, full of humility and loyalty, expreſſing their utmoſt reſolution to ſerve him with their lives and fortunes in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>I hope the new method reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, in relation unto publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, will be of as little prejudice unto you where you are, as the report of the occaſion which began with you will do you here.</p>

            <p>I HAVE been abroad all this day, and come with a Head ſo diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Eaſt-wind and duſt, that I can ſay very little this night. The Lords and Commons have not yet found the way of agreeing upon the method of trying the Earl of Danby and the other Lords. The Biſhops are the principal cauſes of the diſpute, affecting a right to ſit as Judges, and content themſelves to leave the exerciſe of it to the Papiſts, but with a proteſtation that the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent be not alledged againſt them for the future, but inſiſt upon ſitting in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0586502400:67"/>
the Earl of Danby's caſe, until they come to vote upon life or death; and to ſhew how ingenious they are in that point, they profeſs they do no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to their calling, in being his Judges, reſolving not to condemn him. The truth is, that buſineſs is full of a multitude of difficulties, that are very hard to decide; the chief of which are, firſt, whether the King hath power to pardon one impeached by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; ſecondly, whether that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belonging to the declaratory part of the Law, is to be given by one or both Houſes. Thirdly, in caſe the King can pardon, whether this hath the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities required. Fourthly, If this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don be not good, whether he may be admitted to plead any thing elſe. Fifthly, If he may plead, whether the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0586502400:68"/>
points he is accuſed of amount to Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which may probably exerciſe the Houſe until it be diſſolved or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued. The two Houſes differ alſo, in that the Lords would firſt try the Popiſh Lords, and the Commons would give the preference to Danby.</p>
            <p>The Duke Hamilton arrived the laſt week from Scotland with a great train, and was received here in triumph: All that come with him ſay, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of St. Andrew's was killed by one that had been his own Steward, and others that were not Conventicle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſevere Bill</hi> againſt the <hi>Duke of York</hi> was read on Thurſday laſt, and is appointed to be read again to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0586502400:69"/>
It recites the Pope's pretenſions to power over Kings, particularly in England; the Immorality of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Religion; Incompatibility of thoſe that profeſs it with Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; their perpetual Plots againſt the Government; ſedulity in ſeducing the Duke; and a multitude of other things of the like nature in the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Aſſerts the power of Parliament to diſpoſe of the Succeſſion, as beſt conduced to the good of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which had been often exerciſed in debarring thoſe that were neareſt in blood, but never with ſo much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as now: Wherefore it doth enact, <q>that the Duke ſhould be, and was thereby excluded; declares him at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of high Treaſon, if he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in England before or after the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0586502400:70"/>
King's death; forbids commerce or correſpondency with him, under the ſame penalty of Treaſon.</q> This pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the City ſo well, that a petition is framing there, which will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in two Days, ſigned by one hundred thouſand men, to give thanks unto the Parliament for their vigorous proceeding in diſcovering the Plot, and oppoſing of Popery, and promiſing to aſſiſt them in ſo doing with their lives and fortunes.</p>

            <p>YOUR Nephew arrived here laſt night, and I going to welcome him, received your letter from him. His friends find he bears in his face too fair marks of a Spaniſh journey, but in all things elſe, I believe he will give them as entire ſatisfaction as unto me, who ever had an extraordinary good opinion of him.</p>
            <p>This day was ſe'nnight the proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Parliament was ſpoken of, but being then uncertain, and (as I thought) not like to be, I was not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0586502400:73"/>
willing to mention it; but it fell out the next day, and all men's wits have been ſcrewed ever ſince that day to find out the conſequences. Every body hath had his conjecture, and the moſt ignorant ſhewed themſelves the moſt bold, in aſſerting their opinions. Many find that the King would not have done it, if he had not reſolved to ſend for the Duke; keep up the Army; deſire aſſiſtances from abroad; ſell Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey and Tangier to the French, (for which Mr. Savile is to make the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) ſet the Earl of Danby at liberty, and with the help of the Papiſts and Biſhops ſet up for himſelf. But inſtead of this, we ſee little reaſon to believe the Duke will think himſelf well here: The Army is in part diſbanded, and had been entirely before this day, if it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0586502400:74"/>
had pleaſed Colonel Birch. The place from whence the foreign aſſiſtances ſhould come is not known: Mr. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile is not thought very good at ſuch Treaties: The Earl of Danby is like to lie where he is, and the utmoſt help his Majeſty can (for ought I hear) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, until the Parliament do meet, is, by Fox, Kent, and Duncomb's credit, which perhaps will not be found to be a very ſteddy foundation. No man will avow having been the King's Counſellor in this buſineſs; and ſome wonder, that his Majeſty in conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the privy Council, having promiſed that he would have no cabinet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but that he would in all things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their advices, next unto thoſe of his great Council the Parliament; ſhould ſo ſuddenly prorogue that great
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0586502400:75"/>
Council, without ſo much as aſking the other. This fills men with many ill humours; the Parliament-men go down diſcontented, and are like by their reports to add unto the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Countries, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready very great; and the fears from the Papiſts at home, and their friends abroad, being added thereunto, they begin to look more than formerly unto the means of preſerving themſelves.</p>
            <p>There hath been a ſuit at Law in Scotland, between the Earl of Argyle, and one Macclaine a great man in the Highlands, and the Earl (as is ſaid) by the favour of Duke Latherdale, hath obtained a decree for the Lands in queſtion; which by order from hence, is to be put in execution, by the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0586502400:76"/>
ſtrength of all the King's forces in Scotland, and fire and ſword to be uſed in caſe they find reſiſtance; as probably they will, Macclaine reſolving he will not be turned out of his ancient inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by a trick in law, and a decree from corrupt Judges: This Man being head of a numerous and ſtout people, helped by the faſtneſs and poverty of their Country, may perhaps make good what he propoſeth unto himſelf; and to ſhew he is not to be ſurpriſed, he hath already entered into Argyle's Country with 800 or 1000 men. The Earl of Athol is his neighbour, friend, and enemy to Argyle, ſo as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, he may give him ſecret aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the firſt, and afterwards more openly. About the ſame time a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was there publiſhed, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0586502400:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it Treaſon to be preſent at any of the Field-Conventicles that are armed; and every man knowing the preſſures they are expoſed unto if they go diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, they muſt incurr the penalties, or abſtain wholly from going, which they will hardly be perſwaded unto. Things being thus brought unto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, the King hath been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to give a hearing unto what the Duke Hamilton, and other Scotch Lords, have to ſay againſt Latherdale, as is appointed before the Council.</p>
            <p>Two aſſociates were offered unto Sir Thomas Chichely, for the better executing of his Office of Maſter of the Ordnance; but he thinking that an affront to a man of ſo eminent abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as himſelf, refuſed them, which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0586502400:78"/>
hath obliged the King to diſmiſs him from the place, and put it into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as ſome others have been; Sir Thomas Littleton, Sir William Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Sir Joſeph Lowther are ſaid to be the men. If what is ſaid be true, the ill management of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury was not more extreme, than this of the Ordnance; for beſides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies of furniſhing the French Armies with arms and ammunition, (whereas the Stores where fuller two years ago than ever they were known to have been) there are now but ſix hundred muſkets in the Tower, and other things in proportion.</p>
            <p>Some think theſe ways of <hi>employing many Parliament-men,</hi> may ſtrengthen the King's party in the Houſe. Others
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0586502400:79"/>
think, that a <hi>King is ever a loſer when he enters into a Faction, and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys againſt his Subjects;</hi> beſides that theſe men will loſe their credit, and, having only ſingle votes, will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by number. I do not find the new privy Counſellors well at eaſe, and am not free from ſear, that whilſt they endeavour to keep fair with both parties, they may give diſtaſte unto both. Harry Sydney is to go Envoy extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary into Holland, and yeſterday the King declared unto him his intention to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Vanlieu the Holland Ambaſſador is arrived, and Van Beuninghen going away. He made the laſt week a great noiſe about a meſſage ſent by the King of France unto his Maſters, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0586502400:80"/>
the contribution-money due from the Country about Breda; denouncing in a very terrible manner, his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of levying it by force, if it were not paid; and that in an <hi>Ottoman</hi> ſtile, which unto ſome ſilly people gave as ſilly a hope, that the peace would break, and the league be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the French; but the French Ambaſſador ſays, it is a thing of no moment at all, and already compoſed. However I ſee no inclinations in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet men here, to deſire ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure of things abroad, as ſhould engage us to take any part in them, until our affairs are better ſettled at home than they are yet like to be.</p>
            <p>Ireland is in extreme diſorder, by the Duke of Ormond's negligence, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0586502400:81"/>
and favour to the Iriſh. Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs his Regiment thinking to uſe the ſame licentiouſneſs at Kinſale, as it had been accuſtomed unto in France, gives great diſtaſte, and apprehenſions of ſuch works as began almoſt by the ſame ways in 1641. Old Roberts, in appearing of late for the King and Biſhops, thinks himſelf of merit to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him; but he is as ſingular in that opinion as in many others.</p>
            <p>Some that know matters better than I do, muſt tell you, whether we ſhall have the ſame Parliament, at the end of the prorogation, or a new one, or none at all. But I think, this, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will be found neceſſary; and if this be diſſolved, another will be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of leſs inclinations to favour the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0586502400:82"/>
Court. The four Prieſts are ſent down to be hanged, where they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.

            <p>There hath been a ſuit at Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending this good while in Scotland, between the Earl of Argyle, and one Macclaine, the head of a great and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous family in the Highlands. The Earl (as is ſaid) by the help of the Duke of Latherdale, obtained of late a Decree for the poſſeſſion of the Lands
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0586502400:84"/>
in queſtion, and an order was ſent from hence unto the King's Officers, to aſſiſt the Earl in executing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and uſe fire and ſword againſt ſuch as ſhould oppoſe it; which was ſo far proſecuted, that he with 300 of the King's men and 500 of his own, raiſed upon an Iſland of Macclaine's, which he was not able to defend, or perhaps thought it his beſt courſe by way of diverſion to draw Argyle from thence; but what reaſon ſoever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him, he ſaid he would not be put out of the Inheritance of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors by a trick in law, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Judges; and joining the Macdonnells unto himſelf, fell into Argyle's Country with near 3000 men, where he found no reſiſtance; the Lady of Argyle was obliged to leave
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0586502400:85"/>
her houſe, and in ſome haſte retired to Edinborough to get relief, which could not eaſily be granted, leſt the Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſhould take advantage of the King's forces being ſo employed. Some ſay this is only a family feud, others believe it hath a deeper root; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever this is, no man doubts of the truth of the news brought hither by an expreſs on Saturday morning; which is, that the Conventicle-men in the County of Glaſcow are in arms; that one Captain Grimes coming ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too near them, with his Troop and other forces, was beaten back, with the loſs of his Cornet and fourteen Troopers; which according to the poſture he found them in, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to content himſelf with, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to preſs farther. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0586502400:86"/>
was called upon this occaſion on Saturday laſt, but nothing (as I hear) reſolved until they hear more, ſome doubting whether it be a laid buſineſs, or a ſudden tumult raiſed by accident. I know not the truth of this, but <hi>the diſcourſes I have heard very often of late, of thoſe who every day expected ſome ſuch thing,</hi> perſwades me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is not fallen out by chance. Though no reſolution was taken at Council upon this matter, it is ſaid, that private orders are given out to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Officers of the late diſbanded Troops, to get their men again toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and to others, upon the moſt plauſible pretences that they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, to delay their diſbanding as much as may be. Theſe ſuſpicions go too far, and already reach ſome of your
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0586502400:87"/>
friends and mine, to ſuch a degree, that <hi>Counſellors are rather ſaid to be changed than Councils;</hi> and if they do not find a way to cure that ſore, at the next meeting of the Parliament, they will be looked on as their predeceſſors. If nothing from Scotland hinders, the Court will go to Windſor to-morrow. I preſume you know that H. Syd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney hath bought Mr. Godolphin's place of Maſter of the Robes, gives 6000 pounds, and is to go Envoy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary into Holland. The Lord Ranalagh for the ſame ſum paid to the Lord Sunderland is made Gentleman of the Bed-chamber in his place, and the great buſineſs concerning his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is referred to the Council in Ireland.</p>

            <p>THE Scotch news that I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to you laſt week, doth ſtill poſſeſs the minds of all men here; but all relations that come from Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are ſo imperfect, that no man knows what to make of them; and thoſe that come to Court being more particularly ſo than others, no men are thought to underſtand leſs of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs than Privy Counſellors. This is attributed to Latherdale; and though it be concluded, that what he ſays is not true, ſome think the buſineſs worſe, others better, than it is repreſented.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0586502400:90"/>
The fact, as far as I hear, is, that the Earl of Lithco with above five and twenty hundred horſe and foot did come within a few miles of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle-men, and finding them in ſuch a poſture, as he did not think it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to charge them, he concluded the beſt was to let them take Glaſcow, where they are ſaid to have found good ſtore of arms, ammunition and ſome cannon, and having left ſo many men in the Town as are thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to guard it, they march with four pieces. They are ſaid to encreaſe in number every day, but we know nothing of them certainly, unleſs it be that they have no landed men amongſt them, nor any Gentlemen, but a young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er brother to a Knight of the Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton family. The laſt week we heard
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0586502400:91"/>
of nothing but raiſing of great forces to ſubdue theſe Rebels. The Dukes of Monmouth, Albemarle, and Lord Garret were to have Regiments of Horſe, Feverſham one of Dragoons and Grenadiers, the Lord Cavendiſh, Grey of Werk, Mr. T. Thinne, and ſome others, Regiments of Foot; but that heat ſeems to be ſomething abated. The Lord Grey gave up his Commiſſion, Mr. Thinne refuſed to take any; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendiſh doth not raiſe any men upon his, and Garret ſwears he will not be at a penny charge to raiſe a man, but if the Commiſſioners for the Treaſury will raiſe him a Regiment, and provide money to pay it, he will command it. Whilſt ways were ſought to remove theſe difficulties, the Scotch Lords that are here endeavoured to perſwade the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0586502400:92"/>
King, that the buſineſs may be ended by far more certain and leſs chargeable ways, in as much as theſe men having been driven into a neceſſity of taking arms, by the extreme preſſure ſuffered from thoſe that did abuſe the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity his Majeſty had truſted them with, the people being eaſed of thoſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, the perſons removed that had cauſed them, and ſuch men placed in the Government, as were acceptable to the Nation, they durſt undertake that all may be compoſed without blood. This was not (as I hear) diſliked, but another point was ſtarted, that doth yet more incline the Court to mild courſes; which is, in the Year 1641 Acts of Parliament were made in both Kingdoms, making it Treaſon for any perſon belonging unto either to make
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0586502400:93"/>
war upon or invade the other, without the conſent of Parliament. And though one or two of the Judges ſay, that the Acts being reciprocal, the Scots having reſcinded theirs, ours falls of itſelf; or though it did not, the act forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an Invaſion, no ways toucheth ſuch as by the King's command ſhould go to ſubdue Rebels; others ſay, that what the Scots did might indeed give unto the Parliament of England a juſt ground of annulling their act alſo, but not having done it, no man can doubt but it remains in force; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever marcheth againſt Scotland incurrs the penalties of Treaſon denounced by it. And ſome that were preſent at the making of it, are ſo far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the diſtinction between <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading</hi> and <hi>ſubduing Rebels,</hi> as to ſay,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0586502400:94"/>
that the Parliament then finding they had been upon the like pretence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged againſt Scotland in 1638 and 39, made this act expreſsly to hinder any ſuch a buſineſs as that which is now depending; and to take care, that England ſhould never be again engaged againſt Scotland, without the conſent of the Parliament; which was alſo the reaſon why the act was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in force on our ſide, though it was diſſolved on theirs. This renders men of eſtates unwilling to engage, and hereupon the Duke of Monmouth was ſent away yeſterday in ſuch haſte, as to carry no more company with him, than could go in one day to your good town of Newark, where he was to lodge the laſt night. He is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with powers of indulgence to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0586502400:95"/>
compoſe rather than deſtroy; and the Lord Melvin (who is thought well enough inclined to Non-conformiſts, and well liked by them) is ſent with him, as being thought a fit Miniſter of a good agreement. The foot that was embarqued in the Thames is gone for Barwick, where it is to ſtay to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Town; and the other forces, that are newly entertained, are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue only for a Month. This looks as if your friend Latherdale may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while be leſt as naked as the Earl of Danby. The army is almoſt every where diſbanded, unleſs it be theſe that upon this occaſion are again taken into pay, and the Countries almoſt every where expreſs the utmoſt hatred unto them, as ſoon as they have laid down their arms. Douglas his Regiment now
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0586502400:96"/>
in Ireland, as is ſaid, hath orders to march into Scotland, which giving people oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to talk of that Country, they ſay that the King having lately placed the greateſt powers of the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in the hands of the three worſt men that could be found in them, can never be at eaſe until they are all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, to expiate the faults of the Government, and appeaſe the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Harry Sydney hath his Inſtructions for Holland. Sir Henry Goodrike is going into Spain, as a pattern by which that Court may judge of the wit and good ſenſe of our Nation. On Friday laſt Harcourt, Whitebread, and three other Prieſts were, at the old Baily, found guilty of the Plot, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0586502400:97"/>
as Traitors. On Saturday the like ſentence paſſed upon Langhorne. The trials were in all reſpects fair, even by the confeſſion of the adverſaries. The arraigned perſons placed all the hopes of their defence upon the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidating of Oates his teſtimony, to which end they had about 16 witneſſes ſent from St. Omer's, to aſſert that they had ſeen him every day in May and June was a twelve month at St. Omer's, and conſequently he could not be here as he doth aſſert; but as three of them, having been apprehended by Sir Will. Waller at their firſt coming, told him they were come to be witneſſes, and being aſked what they were to witneſs, they ſaid they muſt know that from their ſuperiors; it did plainly appear at the trial, that they were ready to ſay
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0586502400:98"/>
whatever they were bid; and Oates did plainly prove by a Knight and two of his ſervants, two Proteſtant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, a Popiſh Prieſt, and ſome others, that he was here at that time; ſo as his teſtimony was taken without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. This is a dangerous leading caſe for the Lords in the Tower, whoſe principal hopes were to invalidate the teſtimony of Oates, Bedloe, and Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale; all which being confirmed by the judgment of a jury in the face of all London, cannot be queſtioned. Wakeman was to have been tried the ſame day, but being arraigned the trial was put off for a month, as is ſaid, at the ſollicitation of the Portugal Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and in a way that to many ſeemed ſcandalous. If the Scotch bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs be ſettled, the King will go to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0586502400:99"/>
Windſor as he intended. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the laſt year four Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were ſpoken of, for having been ſent down thither to attempt upon the King's life; it is now ſaid that one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio, a ſervant to the Queen, told one belonging to the Duke of Monmouth at that time, that four Iriſhmen were expected there about a buſineſs of great importance; and the King's harbinger ſays, four ſuch were then recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, as men he muſt take a care of, and ſee well lodged.

            <p>I TOLD you in my laſt, that the Duke of Monmouth was gone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſince which time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports have been ſo various, that no man well knows what to make of that buſineſs; and the cauſe of this uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is imputed to the diligence of the King's Officers, who intercept and keep all letters directed unto perſons any ways ſuſpected, ſo as no more is known, than they think fit to divulge. An expreſs arrived here on Saturday-night from Edinburgh, and brought news that the Duke of Monmouth arrived there on Wedneſday: That he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0586502400:101"/>
had been received with great joy, and as much honour, as thoſe that were there could ſhew unto him: That the Council having been immediately call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he expoſed unto them his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which was very well liked: That the Chancellor invited him to ſupper that night, and that he was the next morning to go to the Army, having firſt ſent an expreſs to the Lord Lithco, that commands it, no ways to engage in any action before he comes. Some think that he hath the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle-men at an advantage, and will purſue it to their deſtruction. Others ſay, that upon the extreme averſion that is ſhewn all over England to a War in Scotland, and the little probability yet appearing of the Parliament's being any ways engageable in it, he hath receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0586502400:102"/>
much more gentle inſtructions, and intends, by the help of the Lord Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, to compoſe thoſe buſineſſes if he can; and if he can accompliſh it, will certainly render himſelf very popular in England and Scotland.</p>
            <p>The Duke Hamilton and ſome other Scotch Lords, having let his Majeſty know, that the diſorders in Scotland proceeded only from the extreme preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the people was brought under, by thoſe who contrary to Law ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed the power his Majeſty had truſted them with, did undertake to finiſh all without blood, if he would be pleaſed to eaſe them of thoſe preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and, removing thoſe who had cauſed them, put the Government of the Kingdom into the hands of ſuch perſons as were well-pleaſing unto the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0586502400:103"/>
Nation. This having been taken into conſideration for ſome days, the Duke Hamilton with the reſt, and one Loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kart, were ſent for by the King, who told them, the points formerly ſpoken of did relate unto his <hi>Prerogative,</hi> which in <hi>three points</hi> he would not ſuffer to be touched: 1ſt, That he having a right of diſpoſing of all <hi>places,</hi> might incapacitate ſuch perſons as he ſhould think fit: 2dly, That it belonging to him to prevent <hi>conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> he might ſecure and impriſon ſuſpected perſons; and that there was no ſuch thing as a Habeas Corpus in Scotland, nor ſhould be as long as he liv'd: 3dly, That it being his part to prevent or to quell <hi>rebellions,</hi> he might raiſe ſuch forces as he pleaſed, quarter them where he thought fit, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0586502400:104"/>
them as occaſion ſhould require. To which Lockart replied, that the <hi>places</hi> in queſtion were thoſe belonging to Counties and Corporations, which had ever been choſen by the <hi>people</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively according to their Charters. And foraſmuch as concerns <hi>conſpiracies</hi> and <hi>rebellions,</hi> he thought he could prove, that what his Majeſty did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert did neither agree with the Laws of Scotland, nor any other Law, nor the ends for which that, or any other Government was conſtituted.</p>
            <p>The next point in diſcourſe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome articles exhibited againſt Latherdale; in which it is ſaid, that <q>his Majeſty for ſeveral years paſſed had been utterly miſinformed, and never known the truth of any thing relating unto Scotland, but been
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0586502400:105"/>
guided by ſuch reports as beſt ſuited with Latherdale's intereſts.</q> That he had been thereby induced to bring down the laſt year that army of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Highlanders, upon pretence of mutinous and ſeditious Field-conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; whereas ſuch meetings as had been, were modeſt and quiet; and quartered them in thoſe countries where there never had been any at all. Several other miſdemeanors are ſaid to be mentioned, and amongſt others, that of Michell, who had been put to death after having had a promiſe of life and limb, by falſe oaths made by Lather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale and ſome others of the privy Council. The concluſion was, the King commanded the Duke that <hi>theſe articles ſhould not be made publick.</hi> In which he excuſed himſelf, foraſmuch
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0586502400:106"/>
as having done nothing in the dark, ſeveral copies had been taken, which were not in his power. Some ſay, we ſhall this day ſee them in print, with the Declaration of the Conventicle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, printed at Glaſcow, which is very well worth ſeeing. The forces of theſe Conventicle-men, or, as they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Weſtern Army, are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reported. Some ſay, they have 14000 or 15000 Men; others, that this Day was a ſe'nnight they had, not far from Stirling, between two and three thouſand Horſe, well armed and mounted, with about the like number of Foot; that a brother of the Earl of Galloway was coming to them, and within three hours march, with above four hundred horſe and foot, and that they had parties of good ſtrength in ſeveral other places.</p>

The five Prieſts formerly condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were executed on Saturday, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing nothing. Langhorne is reprieved for ſome time, upon his offer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that which ſhall deſerve his Life. The Earl of Shaftſbury hath been twice with him, but, as is ſaid, hath as yet gained nothing from him, but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſome Lands belonging to the Jeſuits, Franciſcans, and Benedictins, not exceeding two thouſand pounds a year, which will not ſave his life. Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is to be tried this week at the King's Bench bar. His relations deſire he ſhould confeſs, and think he will. It is ſaid that about this time was a twelvemonth, ſome women viſiting his wife, ſaw a daughter of his, growing up to be marriageable, which gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the goſſips to aſk the mother,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0586502400:108"/>
what portion ſhe ſhould have? To which ſhe anſwered, that if one thing hit right, Sir George would give her ten thouſand pounds; which people now reflecting upon, together with the life and eſtate of the Perſon, believe That <hi>one</hi> thing which was to enable him to give ſo large a portion, was the 15000 pounds, which was promiſed him to poiſon the King.</p>
            <p>There is a certain Petition prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in London to be preſented unto the King, which, as is ſaid, will be ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many Lords, Gentlemen, and all the principal houſe-holders of the City of London, taking notice of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my having been raiſed upon pretence of the French War, kept up by Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's means contrary to an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0586502400:109"/>
as a ſtanding Army. In the next place it mentions the Acts of Parliament made in England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, making it Treaſon for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of either kingdom to invade the other, or the ſubjects thereof, giving power and enjoining all other ſubjects of either to fall upon and deſtroy ſuch as ſhould in any time attempt to do it, as rebels and traitors; and ſhewing the dangerous conſequences of forcing the Proteſtants of his kingdom to imbrue their hands in each other's blood, if according to the rumour ſpread of a war in Scotland, any men ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the act march againſt them; deſiring his Majeſty to put an end to their fears in that point, compoſe things there, ſuffer the Parliament to meet the 14th of Auguſt, bring Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0586502400:110"/>
and others to their trials, perfect the diſbanding of the army, and other new-rais'd forces. If this petition do take, as ſome believe, it will be ſent to the Grand Juries in the ſeveral coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and come up ſigned by ſo many as ſhall approve of it. Some ſay, the Highlanders have laid down their arms, and ſubmit the determination of their differences with Argyle to the King.</p>

            <p>I WRITE to you now rather to keep my day, than from an opinion that theſe laſt days have produced any thing that deſerves to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto you. The news concerning the Scots, mentioned in my laſt, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ſeveral expreſſes, and all ſhew their defeat to have been entire, the party diſſipated, and thoſe who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the fury of the ſword remain expoſed to the diſcretion of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors. I find men's judgments as various, as to the uſe will be made of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0586502400:115"/>
this advantage, as of the Duke of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth's action in what is paſſed. Some did think that they being a poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, brought into deſpair by the moſt violent perſecution, pitied by all both in England and Scotland, helped by none, without head or conduct, were to be ſpared; and that in doing ſo, he might have made himſelf very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular in both Kingdoms, (which he is thought with reaſon much to deſire) and beſt to have provided for the King's intereſt. Others, who look upon it as a fine thing to kill a great many men, and believe Monarchies are beſt kept up by terrour, extol the action, and ſay there is no other way of ſuppreſſing old rebellions, or preventing new ones, than by force and rigour; looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Caligula as a great Stateſman, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0586502400:116"/>
               <hi>oderint dum metuant</hi> as a good maxim. Some think that the Duke of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth's firſt inſtructions were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the firſt of theſe ways, but that he was followed by others, which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured much of the ſecond; thoſe that were of the firſt opinion, do now think the beſt way were to compoſe things there, and by ſhewing indulgence not only in ſparing thoſe that are obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but in giving them ſuch indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in matters of conſcience, as may ſatisfy them, prevent the like, and pleaſe the Body of the Engliſh Nation, which hath given many tokens of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much concerned for them. On the other ſide, thoſe are not wanting who think the beſt way of bringing that ſtubborn people into ſubjection, and keep 'em, as they call it in peace, free from
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0586502400:117"/>
rebellions, is to uſe the utmoſt rigour upon thoſe that are in their power, and to diſcover who did in any meaſure aſſiſt or abet them; and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the priſoners are uſed moſt cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and it is ſaid, that at the leaſt forty of the moſt noted men amongſt them ſhall be put into the <hi>Boots</hi> my Lord of Latherdale hath brought into faſhion, to make them diſcover what correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the great men held with them. I know not how far this may concern ſome that are, or lately have been here but it is probable enough they may have the fortune that ordinarily accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies them that pretending to be very ſubtile and keep well with both ſides, ever do too much or too little; and that whereas they might have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all tumults, if they had endeavoured
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0586502400:118"/>
it, by denying all manner of favour to the diſcontented people; or reformed the ſtate of that Kingdom, if they would have taken the conduct of them, and very well provided for their own intereſt by either way, may have ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe poor people by ſtirring them up, and leaving them to themſelves; brought the whole Nation under the power of their enemy, and given ſuch advantages againſt themſelves, as may be their ruin, if they are purſued; that is, to periſh or be ſaved by the mercy of him they profeſs to abhor. Duke Hamilton complains he is ruined by this buſineſs, and that not only all the proviſions of victuals and corn and graſs upon the ground is deſtroyed, but that there is not a Cow, one Horſe or Sheep left upon his whole eſtate; and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0586502400:119"/>
his own houſe had been plundered, if the Duke of Monmouth had not ſent an Officer to preſerve it. But Lather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale ſays, he cannot believe that Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's friends, tenants, and ſervants, would ſo far forget their dependence, obligations and good manners, as to deal uncivilly with him. Such as are near unto thoſe who manage buſineſſes may ſpeak poſitively of them, but I muſt as you ſee ſuſpend my judgment, until the Duke of Monmouth comes back, which is expected in a few days.</p>
            <p>The Petition I mentioned in my laſt did meet with ſome interruption, but the defeat of the Scots put an end to it. Thoſe who uſe to extol all that relates to Rome, admire the conſtancy of the five Prieſts executed the laſt week,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0586502400:120"/>
but we ſimple people find no more in it, than that the Papiſts, by arts formerly unknown to mankind, have found ways of reconciling falſhood in the utmoſt degree with the hopes of ſalvation, and at the beſt have no more to brag of, than that they have made men dye with lies in their mouths. Langhorne's diſcoveries being trivial, relating only to lands of a ſmall value belonging to Convents, I think he will be hanged this day or to-morrow. Wakeman's trial is put off, as is believed to avoid the indecency of the diſcourſes that would have been made. This day and to-morrow will bring all the Court to Windſor. The King is to meet the Council every Thurſday at Hampton Court, and we of the Vulgar expect after their firſt meeting to hear, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0586502400:121"/>
the Parliament ſhall meet or no, at the time appointed. Some ſpeak as if our ſmall Queen, upon pretence of going to Burton, would be ſo cruel as to leave us.</p>

            <p>IF I had a mind to play the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, like a houſe of Commons man newly preferred to be a privy Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, I ſhould very gravely excuſe myſelf for not writing to you by the laſt poſt, and lay the fault upon my want of lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, putting as much weight upon a Law-ſuit, as they do upon affairs of State; but having at their coſts learnt, that thoſe who make ſuch diſcourſes, cheat none but themſelves, I inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly confeſs, I had nothing to ſay; and that now the Parliament is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued and the Court at Windſor, I
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0586502400:123"/>
hear little more than I ſhall do when I am dead. The truth is, ſome of our friends being newly grown men of buſineſs, are ſo politick and ſecret, that a man who ſees it can hardly forbear laughing; but none is ſo ingenuous as to be content men ſhould do it, except the Lord Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax, who is ſometimes free enough with his Companions to begin. I long ſince found that the deſign of ſending H. Sydney into Holland, was like the reſt of Sir William Temple's projects, a matter of great depth, and kept ſo cloſe, that not one of them would ſpeak to me of it; but this day was a ſe'n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night a Gentleman that came to ſee me, took a letter out of his pocket, newly come from Holland, wherein the whole end of his Negotiation is ſet out very plainly; which in ſhort is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0586502400:124"/>
to be no more, than under the pretence of a guaranty to draw Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Spain into a League with England, which may help the Prince of Orange with an occaſion of breaking the peace lately made; which I believe will take effect, if the French can be perſwaded to ſleep three months, and take no notice of it; if the Louveſteine party in Holland, and their aſſociates can be brought to believe the Prince of Orange thinks of advancing no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt but the publick good of the Country; and if our houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons can be ſo well ſatisfied with the management of the laſt buſineſs in Flanders, as to be willing to raiſe a new army under the ſame conduct, and to believe one that is ſo raiſed, will conduce to the defence of Flanders, as much as the laſt.</p>

The laſt poſt brought me yours of July the 12th, and if you confeſs you did not know what to make of the Scotch buſineſs before you had my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I may conclude you were as much in the dark afterwards, for I could not make you underſtand that which I am ignorant of; and to ſay the truth, I am ſo; a great part of our modern pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence being to ſuppreſs informations of the truth, which I take to be as great a point of ſubtilty as that of one of our friends, who concealed a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune befallen him in the firſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he had with a woman, until he was like to fall into pieces. Some think the great Lords will be found to have incited the poor people, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to value themſelves at Court upon the power they had of appeaſing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0586502400:126"/>
them; and if that prove true, they may have the fortune that ordinarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies thoſe that do too much or too little, and my Lord Latherdale's Boots will be a powerful means of diſcovering whether this be ſo or no.</p>
            <p>Monſieur de Flamarin hath been received at Windſor as ſeriouſly, as if it had been believed the Queen of Spain's marriage ſhould not hold, unleſs it were here approved, and the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that are uſual with men of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, having been obſerved to him, he is grown to think he is ſo. You know Monſieur de Barillion governs us (if he be not miſtaken) but he ſeems not to be ſo much pleaſed with that, as to find his <hi>Embonpoint</hi> encreaſed by the moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our air, by frequently clapping
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0586502400:127"/>
his hands upon his thighs, ſhewing the delight he hath in the ſharpneſs of the ſound that teſtifies the plumpneſs and hardneſs of his fleſh; and certainly if this climate did not nouriſh him better than any other, the hairs in his noſe, and nails of his fingers could not grow ſo faſt as to furniſh enough of the one to pull out, and of the other to cut off in all Companies, which being done he picks his ears with as good a grace as my Lord La. The diſſolution of the Tables at Windſor hath cauſed a great ſolitude there, which leaves the King few better entertainments than fiſhing, and unto ſome of our friends a good opportunity of making their court, which they improve. A man is come out of the North, who ſays, that Sir Thomas Gaſcoin did treat with him
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0586502400:128"/>
to undertake to kill the King, ſent him to London to receive farther inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and tells his ſtory ſo diſcreetly, that every body believes him. He ſeems to involve Sir George Ratclife of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland, who had been formerly taxed by Oates. One Carrill, a Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex Gentleman, was laſt week ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brought before Oates; he ſays he is a Jeſuit, and the ſame man that by thoſe of the Society was called Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, of whom much hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>I dare not aſſure you that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to, whom the Letters were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed that I ſent to you, is as honeſt as he is underſtanding in buſineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I doubt men that are neceſſitous and live by their wits, may be apt to ſwerve from the beſt way, and I know
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0586502400:129"/>
ſome of his near relations to be very naught; but I can truly ſay, that in many years acquaintance I have not found him guilty of any ill thing, and I am ſure that a brother of his, having undertaken one that was abominable, he was ſo far from joining with him, that he diſcovered it to the perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, and as I believe thereby ſaved his life; and ſince that time ſo brake with his brother, as never to have looked upon him for this 13 or 14 years. I hear the Duke of Monmouth is expected here this day. We poor people know nothing of the ſitting of the Parliament, but are confident it will not be in Auguſt.</p>

            <p>YOU may with reaſon believe, I am little informed of what paſſeth in the world, that in my laſt letter I ſaid nothing of the Parliament, which I make no doubt but others, that writ to you the ſame day, ſaid was diſſolved. The truth is, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs being done at Hampton-Court, the news came not hither until the afternoon, and I having it two or three hours later than others, had already ſent my letter to the poſt, and could not recover it to make an addition, though of ſo great importance. This buſineſs is wholly imputed unto your two friends, and the other that ever
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0586502400:131"/>
joins with them; but the King find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it would not paſs at Council, takes it wholly upon himſelf; tho' that, as well as ſome other things of the like nature, are thought not well to agree with what his Majeſty was pleaſed to declare when he made the new Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to have no Cabinet Council, but next unto the advices of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to follow their's in all things; and the world looking upon this as the work of the three above mentioned, they begin to be ſpoken of all over England in the ſame manner as Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and I fear, may be impeached the next Parliament upon this point, and the War in Scotland, as is ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an act Parliament in the Year 1641. The new Parliament is to meet on the 7th of October: there
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0586502400:132"/>
will be as great canvaſſing for Places as ever, people believing this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was diſſolved only in hopes of having one that would be leſs careful of the publick intereſt. All men that wiſh well unto it, think it neceſſary to imploy all their induſtry in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make it better in that ſenſe; and many believe they will effect it, though ſome probably will grow weary of the expences of Elections, and the ways of preventing them as yet are not ſettled. The Lord Halifax is made an Earl, under the ſame title. The Lord Sunderland hath order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Warrants to confer the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon the Lords Garret and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts.</p>
            <p>The Lord of Wiltſhire's marriage with Mrs. Coventry was the laſt week
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0586502400:133"/>
celebrated with great ſolemnity; and yeſterday the young couple came to the Marqueſs of Wincheſter's houſe, where there was a mighty feaſt, and much dancing and rejoicing. Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne was yeſterday hanged, profeſſing the ſame innocence that the Jeſuites did, and had the fortune as well as they, to be believed only by thoſe that are in the ſame crimes, or are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in having them concealed. This day the Council was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily aſſembled at Hampton-Court, to conſider of Wakeman's buſineſs, with its conſequences, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he is to be tried to-morrow at the Old Baily.</p>
            <p>The laſt week the King gave the Scotch Lords a hearing againſt Lather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0586502400:134"/>
they had counſel on both ſides; Lockart and Cunningham did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove a multitude of things done by Latherdale to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt law; and Mackenzy, the King's Advocate, being of counſel for him, could no ways diſprove them, but had recourſe unto the Royal Authority. The Lords of Eſſex and Halifax were preſent, and both of them, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the latter, did very much uphold the complainants, and, amongſt other things, told the King he ſaw the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh nation was more free than the Engliſh. Nevertheleſs anſwer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to them, that Latherdale had done nothing but what his Majeſty had commanded, and which he would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold by virtue of his <hi>prerogative,</hi> which was <hi>above the law.</hi> This, as is thought,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0586502400:135"/>
will preſerve him from puniſhment, but his place of Secretary will be given to the Lord Magennis.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Monmouth, before he came from Scotland, had taken care that the Scotch Priſoners ſhould be uſed with more humanity than they found amongſt their Countrymen, and ſince his arrival here, orders are ſent to enlarge the indulgence granted unto the Non-conformiſts in their meetings. The reſult of that buſineſs, as far as I underſtand it, is, a great many fools have been killed; their blood lies upon Latherdale; their folly and the cruelty ſhewed unto them hath gained a great deal of compaſſion for thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main of their party, which probably will perſwade thoſe in authority here
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0586502400:136"/>
to proceed more gently; and that which is reaſonable in itſelf, will be rendered abſolutely neceſſary, if the Parliament be ſuffered to ſit; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they prove to be of a temper very different from what is expected, they will ſuffer nothing like unto that which hath been.</p>
            <p>A buſineſs happened lately which makes a great deal of noiſe. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Captain under the ſhelter of the African Company committed ſeveral Piracies upon the Engliſh Company trading in Turky, and lately coming to town, five or ſix principal Merchants that had received the damage, arreſted him, whereupon he complained to the Commiſſioners of the Admiralty, who ſent for the Merchants, and upon their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0586502400:137"/>
refuſal to releaſe the Captain, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. They addreſſed themſelves to one of the Judges for a Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, who before he granted it, gave notice unto the Commiſſioners, that the commitment of the Merchants was againſt Law, adviſed their releaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Habeas Corpus was granted, which could not be denied, which the Commiſſioners refuſed to do; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing farther with Lawyers, found not only that what they had done was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable, but that they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to actions for falſe impriſonment, upon which the injured perſons would obtain great damages; ſo as they found no better way than to releaſe the men, with a great many fair words: But they not being therewith ſatisfied, reſolved to ſue them at law, or bring the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0586502400:138"/>
into Parliament. I write this two days before the going of the Poſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am obliged to make a little journey this day, and ſhall not be back until he be gone.</p>

            <p>I HAVE been out of Town almoſt this month, ſo as my laſt letter to you was dated about that time. At my return I found men's minds more diſturbed than ever I remember them to have been, ſo as there is no extremity of diſorder to be imagined, that we might not probably have fallen into if the King had died, or that may not yet reaſonably be feared if he ſhould relapſe. All that is now to be told of news, is from the Court, and muſt be known from thoſe that are more converſant there than I am.

Though the Parliament is like to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify little, people are buſy in bringing thoſe in, who are of their own mind; and the party that is moſt averſe to the Court ſeems to prevail in the Counties and great Corporations, as the other doth in many of the ſmall Boroughs; and upon the whole matter, many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Houſe will be compoſed as the laſt was, or, as ſome think, of a more harſh humour, the ſame men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething ſharpened.</p>
            <p>Your friend the Lord Latherdale is more powerful than ever in Scotland, openly oppoſeth the Duke of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, and hath ſo far prevailed, as to render the indulgences obtained by him utterly ineffectual: But leſt his power there ſhould not be ſufficient
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0586502400:141"/>
to protect him here, if the Parliament meets, he doth not diſdain a pardon, and as I hear, one is preparing for him. I know not how much your friends and mine do grow at Court, nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the gains they can expect to make there, will countervail what they loſe in the Nation; but I do think myſelf aſſured, that <note n="†" place="bottom">Lords Halifax and Eſſex.</note>two of them, who were generally as well eſteemed as any men I know, are now as ill ſpoken of as any; and the aſperity one of them ſhewed againſt the Papiſts, is moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly retorted upon him.

whether I ſhall be of it, or not, there being a double return; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be aſſured, until the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ariſing thereupon be determined, unleſs it be that as I and my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are out of faſhion, my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions going one way, my friendſhip and alliance with thoſe that are like to give occaſion for the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts drawing another, I ſhall be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſliked and ſuſpected by both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and thereby become the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable member of the <hi>Houſe.</hi> But however matters go, if the houſe doth ſit, and you care to know what I either hear or think, I ſo far abhor the excuſe that is worn out by having been ſo often alledged by liars and fools, as never to pretend to much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs

            <p>I have often heard of Monſieur D'Avaux his behaviour in Holland, but did not need any information as to matter of fact, to be aſſured he would oppoſe it; to believe he would ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and indeed with ſome confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to conclude, that our diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in that caſe is much more for our advantage than what we ſought.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0586502400:146"/>
rejected, will certainly raiſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Holland that is leaſt for the Prince of Orange, and caſt it into a <hi>dependence upon France;</hi> that is leſs mortal unto us than a <hi>League,</hi> that would certainly have produced a rupture of the peace, renewed the war all over Europe, expoſed Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be loſt the firſt year (which this muſt have done;</q> it being as certain, the aſſiſtances expected from hence would have failed, as that it hath not in itſelf that which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for its Defence.) This, and a great deal more upon the like ſubject was told the Lord Sunderland, and Mr. H. Sydney before he went; but Sir William, who was taken for the oracle of thoſe parts, aſſured them, there was no ſuch thing as a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0586502400:147"/>
party in Holland inclined to oppoſe the Prince of Orange: That all was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto his authority, and united in deſiring ſuch an alliance with us: That it would certainly be accepted as ſoon as offered, and that the French which had made the Peace for fear of us, would by the ſame reaſon more exactly keep it, when it was ſeen that we were joined with them. I ſhould think him bewitched, that doth not ſee there is as many falſities, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, and miſtakes in judgment in this matter, as there are words; but I ſee no intention of receding from ſuch counſels, nor remedy for the miſchiefs they bring upon us. It was alſo believed this Buſineſs would have been liked by the Parliament, but I am as confident, as of this that is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0586502400:148"/>
paſſed, that if the Parliament had met, neither this nor any thing that is like to engage us in any war, would have been endured by them, nor that they would have given a Penny towards it.</p>
            <p>You will certainly have heard of a precious <hi>plot,</hi> carried on by a man of four names (who had been almoſt as many times in the pillory for perjury, and ſuch other pieces of wit) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Preſbyterians ſhould be brought under the ſuſpicion of having one now on foot, which ſhould have given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of bailing the Lords in the Tower: But he having had the ill luck to miſtake Manſell for Mansfield, carried a bundle of letters, he had forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to a wrong place; and bringing ſome officers of the cuſtoms to ſearch
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0586502400:149"/>
Manſell's lodgings for Flanders lace, and other prohibited commodities, was fain to find them himſelf; but the miſtake of the ſuperſcription, which was to Mansfield, the ſeals not opened, and other circumſtances making the fraud to appear, the whole matter va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. About the ſame time another deſign of equal prudence and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was carried on to ſuborn Dugdale to renounce his teſtimony concerning the Popiſh plot; but he conſulted with ſome friends, placed two good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes under the hanging to teſtify what the woman ſaid, who treated with him; and when he ſaw a fit time, diſcovered all to the council, ſo as that plot alſo is enervated. We hear of ſeveral other perſons that would more fully diſcover the Popiſh plot;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0586502400:150"/>
but as things ſtand, none dares appear. Serjeant, long ſpoken of, hath depoſed what he knows, and, as I hear, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it into ſafe hands ſigned and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. H. Sydney is ſaid to have made a very ill diſcourſe to him at the Hague, and if it come before the Parliament, will probably have evil effects. The Duke went towards Scotland on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, full of various imaginations, as is ſaid; but ſome underſtanding men think he hath nothing, that ought more to pleaſe him in his journey than good weather. There is a paper caſt about the town of the Earl of Danby his caſe, which makes a very ill one of it; and amongſt other things to prove he was not of the French faction, he ſays, he needs alledge only the French Ambaſſador's diſcourſes of him at
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0586502400:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Madam Mazarin's; this new Logick of proving a thing by a propoſition, either falſe, or as uncertain as itſelf, being looked upon as the invention of that excellent wit.</p>
            <p>I am glad to hear of the dulneſs you obſerve in your neighbourhood, and wiſh you could find means to encreaſe it, believing that nothing elſe can keep them from taking advantage of our follies, as I am ſure the League would have done, if it had been accepted in Holland. H. Sydney arrived here yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday. The Duke his firſt lodging was at Hatfield; the Earl of Saliſbury being at Quickſhot, ſix miles off, ſent his ſon to excuſe his not coming to wait upon his Royal Highneſs, for that he had been let blood five days before.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0586502400:152"/>
No proviſions for his entertainment appeared in the houſe, but two Does upon the table, one barrel of ſmall beer in the cellar, and a pile of faggots. The Duke's ſervants ſent into the town to buy all things neceſſary, even to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and to borrow candleſticks. The gentlemen of the neighbourhood were ſo charitable as to take the Lord of Oſſory and many others to their houſes, where they were well entertained. The Duke being unwilling to be burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to a poor Lord, appointed Sir J. Worden to pay for what he had had, and the Steward took money for the faggots, and eight ſhillings for the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of beer. The Earl of Orrery is dead, and the Lord of Ormond hath made his ſon Arran, Major-General in his ſtead; that if the French invade
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0586502400:153"/>
that kingdom, the army commanded by himſelf and his two ſons may be fit to oppoſe them.</p>

            <p>WE are in a buſy time, and how empty ſoever any man's head hath formerly been, the variety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports concerning things in agitation do ſo fill it, at the leaſt with an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of contributing ſomething to other men's inventions, that they have little leiſure to do any thing elſe. This obligeth me to write in haſte, and without any other conſideration than of the agreement made between you and me, to ſet down nothing but truth; to tell you in ſhort, that the firſt day of the Parliament the Lord Ruſſel
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0586502400:155"/>
named Mr. Williams to be Speaker, who being approved of without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, was with little ceremony, and no excuſe made for himſelf, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto by the King. The two next days were ſpent in ſwearing the members of the houſe of Commons, and putting them to the teſt. On Monday the five and twentieth, the Committees were named, and a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of petitions concerning Elections preſented, and referred unto that of Privileges and Elections.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday the 26th, Dangerfield was brought to the bar of the houſe of Commons, where he did declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf poſitively, that the Duke had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him a great ſum of money to kill the King. He alſo ſaid, that the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0586502400:156"/>
Lord Privy Seal, Peterborough and Sir Robert Payton, were privy unto and contrivers of the <hi>Meal-Tub Plot.</hi> The ſame day the Lord Ruſſell, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miſchiefs and dangers that threaten our nation, ſhewed the Duke to be the center of all. Sir H. Capell ſeconded him. Sir Francis Winning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton made a Recapitulation of all that had been done ſince the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the prejudice of the nation, in favour of Popery, and imputed the greateſt part thereof unto the ſame cauſe; whereupon a vote was paſſed by the houſe <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> that the houſe ſhould proceed inceſſantly upon the further diſcovery of the plot, and the means of preventing a Popiſh ſucceſſor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0586502400:157"/>
Wedneſday the 27th, Dangerfield was brought into the Speaker's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and being put to his oath by a Juſtice of the Peace, did depoſe what he had formerly ſaid. Mr. Hide only and Sir Lionel Jenkins did ſpeak in favour of the Duke; and the latter having the ill luck to ſay, he did in his heart believe his Royal Highneſs was as good a Subject as any is in England, one, that was not far off, whiſper'd, "and as good a Proteſtant.</p>
            <p>The ſame day complaint being made in the houſe of Commons of thoſe who had obſtructed Petitions, and ſome Members ſeverely anſwering ſuch as had been guilty thereof, Sir Robert Howard deſired the Houſe to proceed cautiouſly therein, his Majeſty having
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0586502400:158"/>
by Proclamation declared ſuch Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be contrary to Law. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which admonition, the Houſe did vote nemine contradicente, That it was, and had ever been the right of the Subjects of England to petition his Majeſty for the meeting and ſitting of Parliaments, until all petitions were heard and grievances redreſſed. In the ſecond place they appointed a Committee to examine who had been guilty of obſtructing ſuch Petitions, and therein betraying their Country. There are ſix or ſeven Members of the houſe of Commons ſaid to have declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves deteſters and abhorrers of ſuch Petitions, who, as is thought, will be turned out of the Houſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other ceremony.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0586502400:159"/>
The ſame day Sir Robert Payton was ſuſpended the Houſe.</p>
            <p>An American Jew, lately interpreter to the laſt Portugal Embaſſador that was here, did teſtify before a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the houſe of Lords, that he had been ſuborned by the ſaid Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador to kill the Earl of Shaftſbury, by caſting Hand-granadoe's into his Coach as he ſhould be going to, or coming from Chelſea; and to find others to kill Arnold, Oates and Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe. He mention'd this at firſt in the phrenſy of a Fever, and finding that he had ſo diſcover'd himſelf, found no better way of ſecurity than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the whole to the Earl of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon the firſt day of May laſt, and deliver'd unto him the whole matter
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0586502400:160"/>
in writing. The Earl doth neither deny the receipt of the papers, nor give any reaſon why he concealed it.</p>
            <p>Many terrible accuſations come in againſt Angleſy.</p>
            <p>The Lord Halifax brought in a Bill for the ſpeedy diſcovery and conviction of Papiſts, and eaſe of Nonconformiſts, but ſo contrived, that both parties are almoſt equally incenſed againſt him for it. The houſe of Lords was on Thurſday turned into a Committee, and, as I hear, will be ſo every day, to conſider of it, and try whether it can be ſo mended, as to be uſeful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ends intended. I know not whether that can be done or no; but I could have wiſhed, that intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0586502400:161"/>
to oblige above a Million of men, that go under the name of Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, he had been pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with one of that number, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ways of doing it.</p>
            <p>On Friday twenty-nine Lords and Commoners were invited by the Lord Mayor to his feaſt, and after dinner the Duke of Monmouth came to them. In his return he was accompanied by a great number of people, that ran to ſee him and Eſquire Thinne. It was obſerved that having formerly had a Bar in his Arms upon his Coach, it was then wiped out.</p>
            <p>October the 30th Dugdale did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto the houſe of Commons, that Ewers the Jeſuit told him, there
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0586502400:162"/>
had been a conteſt between the Duke of York and Coleman; he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Duke put him upon bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes that would bring him to be hanged, the Duke told him, he would ſecure his life, ſo he would hold his peace: Coleman anſwered, he could do ſo for the future; but he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready confeſſed ſo much unto his Friend Sir Edmond Godfrey, that it was in his Power to diſcover him and all his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; whereupon the Duke replied, that ought not to trouble him, for order ſhould be taken to keep Godfrey from doing any hurt, which in a few days was performed by his death. Cann of Briſtol, and Withins Steward of Weſtminſter, are put out of the houſe of Commons for diſcountenancing and oppoſing Petitioning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0586502400:163"/>
I believe To-morrow will be a great day in the houſe of Commons, in as much as it relates to the Duke; he is ſaid to be arrived in Scotland, but no certain news is come of him, ſince he was ſeen off from Newcaſtle on Monday laſt. If the orders ſent into Flanders from Spain concerning repriſals upon the Duke of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh by ſea or land be executed (as is ſaid) by ſending two or three thouſand Horſe into the Pais de Cleves &amp; de Juliers, I look upon the peace as broken; for the French will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly defend it, or do the like in Flanders.</p>
