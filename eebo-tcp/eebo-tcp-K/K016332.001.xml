            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following work is ſubmitted to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal of the public, with infinite timidity, and apprehenſion, as it is a ſpecies of writing, which I had never attempted before, from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of my dificiency, in the principal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of ſuch compoſitions, namely invention.</p>
            <p>THE generality of NOVEL-READERS may, therefore, probably, be diſappointed in not meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any extraordinary adventure, or uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſituation, in the following pages; while perſons of a more natural taſte, will, I flatter myſelf, be rather pleaſed at finding the ſtories and incidents, here ralated, ſuch as might, for I affirm they did, and moſt of them to my own knowledge, certainly happen, in the various contingencies of real life.</p>
            <p>BUT though I have not attempted to feign any fable, I acknowledge that I have endeavoured to conceal ſome truth, by changing ſcenes, and altering circumſtances, in order to avoid too marked an application, of the ſeveral ſtories and characters, to the real perſons, from whom I have taken my drama. We have no right over other perſons ſecrets, come they to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge through whatſoever medium of intelligence, they may.—Accident confers none, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence forbids it.</p>
            <p>AS there is no fictitious memoir here ralated, neither is there any factitious moral diſplayed, to the incredulous reader, amongſt all the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſentiments of this recital. I write not of puppets, but of men. I have endeavoured to deſcribe the feelings, nay the foibles, of the human heart, ſuch as we are naturally conſcious of, in ourſelves; but meddle not with <hi>the wires</hi>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0465000101:6"/>
               <hi>of the floicks,</hi> which only render us <hi>machines,</hi> by helping us to <hi>perform a part,</hi> of which we have <hi>no ſenſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I KNOW not whether novel, like the <hi>epopee,</hi> has any rules peculiar to itſelf—If it has I may have innocently erred againſt them all, and drawn upon myſelf the envenomed rage of that tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous body, the <hi>minor critics.</hi>—But if I have ſpread a table for them, they ſhall be welcome to the treat, and let them feed upon it, heartily.—Senſibility is, in my mind, as neceſſary, as taſte, to intitle us to judge of a work, like this; and a cold criticiſm, formed upon <hi>rules for wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> can, therefore, be of no manner of uſe but to enable the ſtupid to ſpeak, with a ſeeming intelligence, of what they neither feel nor underſtand.</p>
            <p>L'ABBE Troublet, in his eſſays, on literature and morals, ſays,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Si un ouvrage ſans defaut ètoit poſſible, it ne le ſeroit qu' á un bomme mediocre.</hi>"</q>

            <p>TELL me, my dear philoſophie, wiſe ſiſter, why thoſe gloomy mortals, ſtiled mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, take ſo much pains to put us out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with our preſent ſtate of exiſtence, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that happineſs is not the lot of man, &amp;c. &amp;c. Do they think theſe dogmas enhance the value of felicity, as unexpected bleſſings are moſtly prized? or is it that themſelves, ſoured by mortifications and diſappointments, which their vanity or caprice have occaſioned, they are unwilling to acknowledge that degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in any ſtate of being, which they do not themſelves enjoy? but why do I argue, where I can at once confute? by declaring your Emily bleſſed to the utmoſt extent of her moſt ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic wiſhes; and feeling, if poſſible, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to her felicity, by knowing that you ſhare it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0465000101:8"/>OUR journey was delightful; even the ſun, which had not appeared for ſome days, ſhone forth on us, in its full luſtre: creation ſmiled; the gladneſs of my heart gilded every object; I thought the birds ſung hymeneals, and I was ſorry when even Miſs Weſton's fine voice inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their ſtill ſweeter notes. My lord was—himſelf. I cannot ſay more, to expreſs all that is tender, elegant, and polite.</p>
            <p>LADY Harriet, who you know, is of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle kind, looked aſſent to our happineſs; yet fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſighs eſcaped her. Why ſhould ſhe ſigh? I have heard people ſay they do ſo from habit, without ſenſibility, or ſenſation. Time and uſe may poſſibly work ſuch an effect, but this habit muſt certainly have its riſe, either from ſickneſs, or ſorrow. Perhaps lady Harriet may be in love If unhappily ſo, how truly to be pitied;</p>
            <p>IT is impoſſible I ſhould yet be able to give you any idea of this fine old ſeat, nor do I think I ſhall ever attempt it. I had much rather you ſhould ſee than read its beauties. I hate flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing deſcriptions. Modern writers over-dreſs nature, as ill judging women do themſelves. They give her parterres for patches, hanging woods for lappets, and embroider her beautiful green gown, with all the colours of the rainbow. I flatter myſelf that your taſte (for it is elegant) will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove whatever my lord has planned; and I ſhall not inſiſt much on your admiring the works of his anceſtors. The cloſet in which I am now writing is charmingly ſituated. It commands—but after what I have juſt ſaid, let me command my pen.</p>
            <p>MY lord, ever kind and attentive to me, wrote to his ſiſter, Lady Lawſon, who lives eight miles off, to defer her viſit, till this day, as it was probable I might have been fatigued with my
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0465000101:9"/>
journey. He ſpeaks with ſuch extreme tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this lady, that I begin to love her, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by anticipation.</p>
            <p>BUT hark, her carriage rolls into the court. yard, and my heart ſteps forth to meet her; but returns again to aſſure my dear Fanny, that I am</p>

            <p>MAY my deareſt Emily ever continue an exception to thoſe opinions, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her preſent felicity, have too ſurely their foundation in this world's experience. The bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ingredients of life, are, however, more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly ſcattered in the potions of ſome, than others; and I believe there may be many who have paſſed through life, without feeling one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural misfortune.—But then, theſe favourites of heaven, unworthy of its bounty, are apt to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate afflictions for themſelves, and mourn over ideal for want of real diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>THIS is a failing I am not at all apprehenſive of your falling into, at leaſt for ſome years to come; but as I have ever acted as a mother to my deareſt Emily, or at leaſt, endeavoured, as far as it was poſſible for me, to ſupply that loſs to her infant years, let me now, with the ſame maternal tenderneſs, warn her againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary extreme, that of being too much elated with her preſent joys, <q rend="inline">"leſt whilſt ſhe claſps ſhe kills them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0465000101:10"/>AND now, my Emily, a truce with moraliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I confeſs, would have been improper at this aera, but that you brought it on yourſelf; and I only appear in the character of the ſlave, who attended the triumphs of the Roman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, merely to inform them they were mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Gracious heaven! that ſuch an information ſhould be neceſſary, to any of thy frail creatures! But I find myſelf relapſing, and will learn from you to command my pen.</p>
            <p>POOR lady Harriet! I am ſorry ſhe ſhould have cauſe to ſigh; for I agree with you, that ſighing may be <hi>incidental,</hi> but not <hi>accidental.</hi> I hope the gay ſcene of receiving and returning viſits, &amp;c. in which ſhe will be engaged with you, may help to diſſipate the cloud of her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin. I rejoice in the acquiſition of your new ſiſter; ſhe muſt be amiable if lord Woodville loves her. What a compliment to my Emily! but let it rather make her grateful than vain.</p>
            <p>I FEAR I ſhall not have an opportunity of approving my taſte, by admiring lord Woodville's improvements, for ſome time. Sir John, who is not a little jealous of your not having menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned him, purpoſes going, for a couple of months to Paries. Do not grow jealous, in your turn. I do not intend to accompany him, to that gay ſcene, which would have fewer charms for me, than the rational and rural pleaſures of Woodfort. But I deſign to inoculate my little Edward and Emily, during his abſence. I ſhall not acquaint him with my intention, till it is over. I know he wiſhes it done; and I would ſpare him the anxiety of a fond father, upon ſuch an occaſion. I know too he will be vaſtly obliged to me, for laying hold of this opportunity; for it is an invariable maxim, that all men hate trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of every kind, and chooſe to be out of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0465000101:11"/>
way, when there is any diſagreeable operation to be performed</p>
            <p>MY ſiſter Straffon, who you know is to be married to Sir James Miller, has determined to take her chance with my children. She ſays ſhe could not anſwer it to her conſcience, to marry Sir James, who ſeems to be enamoured of her face, till ſhe has put her features beyond the common danger of an alteration. I went with her laſt night, to Ranelagh—as ſhe ſaid, to take leave of it: I hope but for a ſhort time.</p>
            <p>THE attention of the whole aſſemby, was taken up with a beautiful foreigner, the marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs de St. Aumont. I think I never beheld ſo much vivacity and ſweetneſs joined, before, in the ſame countenance. I have juſt looked up at your picture, and thought it tacitly reproached me, for having ſo ſoon forgot my Emily's face. I'll look again. Her eyes have more vivacity, I muſt confeſs, but yours a greater ſweetneſs. Hers are black, yours are blue. The advantage which each of you have, over the other, in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, may be more owing to colour, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <p>THE marchioneſs has been a widow, about a year, and does not appear to be above twenty. I am certain that if I were a man, I ſhould be in love with her. I am glad ſhe has left Paris, before my <hi>Straffon</hi> goes thither—you may read <hi>Strephon</hi> if you pleaſe. I ſhall take care to keep him out of danger, while he ſtays in London; or perhaps, ſhe might keep him ſighing at home, and ſo mar both his ſcheme and mine. The very beſt of theſe men, my dear Emily, have hearts nearly reſembling tinder, though they would have us think they are made of a ſterner ſtuff—a ſparkling eye ſets them all in a blaze.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0465000101:12"/>LADY Sandford, who doats upon foreigners, has already engroſſed her; perhaps ſhe may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her to go with her into the country. If ſo, you will, probably meet her, at York races; and if that ſhould happen, it will be abſolutely neceſſary for lord Woodville to arm himſelf, cap-à pie, with conſtancy, and for you alſo, to rivet the joints of that armour, with unaffected complacency, chearfulneſs and love.</p>
            <p>LUCY and Sir James Miller are in the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room. I fancy ſhe is tired of a tête-a-tête, as the fondeſt lovers ſometimes are; for ſhe has juſt ſent your little name-ſake, to requeſt my company. I muſt, therefore, quit you, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her ſummons. I ſhall expect a particular account of all occurrences, at Woodfort as the moſt minute matter, that relates to you, muſt ever be of conſequence to your affectionate.</p>

               <p>HE then entreated that they might be married before the operation, and he would give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to her undergoing it, in ten days after. This ſhe abſolutely refuſed; and, I think, with good reaſon. The altercation grew warm, on both ſides; I was choſen umpire; and gave my opinion, in favour of Lucy's arguments. Sir James ſaid I was a partial judge, and quitted us, ſoon after, with ſome little warmth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0465000101:13"/>I WAS ſorry to perceive a ſtarting tear in Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's lovely eye, and rallied her, on being low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited. She confeſſed ſhe felt a kind of forebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the union between Sir James and her, would never be accompliſhed; and yet ſaid, ſhe had not the leaſt apprehenſion that her death would prevent it. I told her that I foreſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe that could, as her beauty was even leſs in danger from this experiment than her life.</p>
               <p>SHE replied, that they were both of them but tranſient bleſſings, and ſhe had, happily, brought her mind to ſuch a ſtate of reſignation, as to be fully prepared for the loſs of either. But ſhe owned that ſhe had not yet accuſtomed herſelf to the thought of reſigning Sir James: however, if ſhe was to loſe his affection, ſhe could better ſuſtain that affliction, bofore marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, than after.</p>
               <p>HERE her eyes ſtreamed again, and while I was endeavouring to diſſipate theſe gloomy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, Sir John luckily came in, to the relief of us both, as it put an end to the ſubject of inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which I told you before, he is not to receive the leaſt hint about, for the preſent. But Lucy and he are affectionately yours, and rejoice with me in your happineſs.</p>
               <p>Once more, adieu, and good night.</p>

            <head type="sub">
               <hi>Lady</hi> WOODVILLE, <hi>to Lady</hi> STRAFFON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My dear FANNY,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I DID not inſiſt upon the permanence of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man felicity. I ſaid only, that there was ſuch a thing as perfect happineſs, and, I hope, with a truly grateful heart, acknowledged myſelf in poſſeſſion of that rare treaſure. However, your letter has given a little alloy to it, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it leſs pure and unmixed.</p>
            <p>I FEEL for you on your children's account, and for Lucy on her own. She has long deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on inoculation: ſhe mentioned it to lady Harriet, before I was married, and made her will, the day after ſhe became of age. I admire her fortitude, but fear I ſhould not be able to imitate it.</p>
            <p>YOUR deſcription of the marchioneſs, is really alarming, and has already made me jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous not of lord Woodville, but of lady Straffon. If you ſhould ever become acquainted with her, ſhe will certainly rival every body, but Sir John, and the dear little ones. Perhaps Lucy's heroiſm may ſtill preſerve her ſome place in your heart, but the poor abſent Emily will be totally forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, when you already begin to ſtand in need of her picture to remind you of her.</p>
            <p>MY lord, and lady Harriet, both knew her in Paris and both agree that the charms of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are inferior to thoſe of her mind; and that ſhe was ſtill more admired, as un bel eſprit, than as une belle dame. Won't you give me credit for the utmoſt generoſity, in furniſhing you with this account of my rival that is to be?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0465000101:15"/>I HOPE ſhe may come to York races, that I may have an opportunity of examining this phoenix, with a critic's eye; but it ſhall not be like the modern ones, who are, generally, ſo intent on ſpying defects, that they are apt to overlook the moſt ſtriking beauties. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, may ſometimes proceed rather from a want of taſte, than a ſpirit of malevolence, and I am always inclined to pity thoſe unhappy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who never ſeem to be pleaſed.</p>
            <p>CHARMING lady Lawſon! What an engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing countenance, what a quick ſenſibility in her looks, what an irreſſiſtible ſmile! I am not under a neceſſity of looking at my bracelet, to remind me that this portrait reſembles lady Straffon: but lady Lawſon is taller, thinner, and more of the brunette. She is two years younger than my lord, and has been married ſix years, to Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Lawſon, who ſeems to be what they call a jolly good-humoured man. He hates Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, loves fox hunting, and has, they ſay, no exception to a chearful glaſs, or a pretty laſs. I fear poor lady Lawſon was thrown away; though Sir William is generally eſteemed what they call a good huſband. He behaves outwardly well to his wife, merely becauſe ſhe is ſo, and would have treated her chambermaid, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if he had happened to marry her. What a mortifying ſituation, to a woman of delicacy!</p>
            <p>THE meeting between her and my lord, was truly affectionate, and tender. She had not ſeen him ſince his return from making the grand tour. She thanked him, in the moſt graceful manner, for increaſing her happineſs, by enſuring his own, and ſhe alſo hoped, that of ſo amiable a perſon, ſhe was pleaſed to add, as lady Woodville. My lord replied, that if any thing could add to his felicity, it muſt be her approbation of his choice,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0465000101:16"/>
which he was certain would encreaſe with her knowledge of his dear Emily. He then joined our hands, bowed, and withdrew. How kind in him to be ſpeak her favour for me! But I ſhall endeavour to deſerve, what ſhe ſeems ſo ready to beſtow.</p>
            <p>LADY Harriet's dove-like eyes gliſtened with pleaſure at her couſin's politeneſs. She ſaid there was a nearer relation between lady Lawſon and me, than what my lord had given us, for we had kindred ſouls.</p>
            <p>HERE the arrival of a great deal of company, put an end to all converſation. Is it not ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſiſter, that where there are moſt words, there is generally the leaſt ſenſe? And yet, it is always the caſe; for I never remember to have met with any thing like rational diſcourſe, in a company that exceeded five or ſix.</p>
            <p>LORD and Lady Withers, their two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the eldeſt a fine woman, and once intended as a wife for lord Woodville. The point had been ſettled between their fathers, but the death of old lord Woodville, happily for me, left the ſon at liberty to chuſe for himſelf. She appeared to be in ſome confuſion, when he ſaluted her, and I felt myſelf a good deal diſtreſſed on her account.</p>
            <p>WOMEN are not ſuch wretches, as men miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent them. Conqueſt, I own, is pleaſant, but I deteſt a triumph. It ſinks one, methinks, below the vanquiſhed. Her ſiſter is pretty, young, and modeſt. I think the whole family amiable, and agreeable.</p>
            <p>SIR Harry Ransford, and his lady.—What a pair! He old, gouty, and peeviſh—ſhe young, handſome and vulgar. His ſon, by a former wife, polite, and ſenſible, with a well-made, genteel perſon. My lord and he were intimate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0465000101:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
abroad. I wiſh he would fall in love with our dear lady Harriet. Nay, he certainly will do ſo. I can't poſſibly ſee how he can well avoid it.</p>
            <p>MR. Watſon, Mr. Young, Mr. Haywood, &amp;c. What a croud! You would have pitied me, Fanny. Though I have been four months married, I was ſo be-brided, and wiſhed joy, that it made me downright ſad. Lady Lawſon was very uſeful to me, in aſſiſting to entertain the company. She has, in her manners and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, a great deal of that graceful, and courtly eaſe, which I always admire in others, without having ever been able to obtain, in myſelf. But all farther endeavours after this perfection, are, henceforward, at an end with me, and I hope now to be able to preſerve my <hi>mauvaiſe bonte,</hi> during life; for after twenty, it is rarely to be overcome, without <hi>paying too dear,</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>IN the afternoon, the younger part of my lord's tenants appeared in the avenue, neatly dreſſed, and adorned with all the honours of the ſpring, and forming a long dance together. My lord propoſed our going out to ſee them; I found this had been deſigned, as there was a large car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſpread on the lawn, and ſeats already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us.</p>
            <p>WHEN we were ſeated, they paſſed by, in couples, chanting a ruſtic hymn, in praiſe of Hymen, and ſtrewing flowers before me. At length, they preſented me with a beautiful, and fragrant wreath, which I immediately placed on lord Woodville's brow, while the villagers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated ſinging, and forming themſelves into a rural dance, infinitely more agreeable to me, than any of the grands balets, at the oppera, or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0465000101:18"/>
theatres. We left them at their ſport, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the houſe.</p>
            <p>AFTER tea, my lord propoſed our following the example of his merry peaſants. This was readily aſſented to, by every one, but Sir Harry Ransford, who told us he never lay within ten miles of his own houſe, after the twenty fifth of March; and inſiſted upon lady Ransford's going away with him, that inſtant, as he ſaid they ſhould hardly be able to reach home, by his uſual time of going to bed, at nine o'clock, ſummer and winter.</p>
            <p>WE all intreated that he would permit lady Ransford to ſtay, which he peremptorily refuſed, ſaying, it would be ſetting an ill example to the bridegroom, to let women have their way. She ſaid every thing in her power to prevail, but when ſhe found it in vain, and that he would force her away, ſhe was provoked, at laſt to call him methodical <hi>monſter.</hi> He replied, that it was better to be <hi>one,</hi> by his own <hi>method,</hi> than hers, and hobbled into his coach. She followed, with the face of a fury. What a delightful tête-á-tête muſt theirs be!</p>
            <p>MR. Ransford ſtaid, and danced with me. I think him the beſt dancer I ever ſaw. Our little ball got the better of all diſagreeable reſerve; and, at ſupper, we appeared like old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, perfectly at eaſe, and quite chearful. My lord was in remarkable good ſpirits, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d even lady Harriet ſeemed gay. The Wither's are a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming family; both the young ladies play on the harpſichord, and ſing finely.</p>
            <p>WE had an agreeable concert the next day; they ſtaid till late in the evening. Sir William and lady Lawſon went home this morning We are to return their viſit to-morrow. Mr. Rans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford is ſtill with us. He is a great lover of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0465000101:19"/>
I fancy there is not much harmony in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, and where the inſtruments of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial concert do not found in <hi>uniſon,</hi> the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord is moſt grating.</p>
            <p>I SHALL long, impatiently, for every poſt, till I hear that all your patients are out of danger. Lucy's preſages with regard to Sir James, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the effect of low ſpirits. I never ſaw any man, I think, more in love, than he appears to be. I cannot, however bear the thoughts of his conſenting to her being inoculated ten days after their marriage. Selfiſh wretch I don't let Lucy ſee this paragraph.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now ſhewn my obedience to my dear motherly ſiſter's commands, by entering into a minute detail of every thing that has paſſed at Woodfort. I am diſappointed at not having the pleaſure of ſeeing her here; yet I highly applaud the diſpoſition of that time ſhe promiſed to beſtow on</p>

            <p>I AM much obliged to my dear Emily, for the entertaining detail of her amuſements in the country. I am charmed with your account of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Lawſon, and am not, like my dear ſpoiled child, the leaſt inclined to be jealous. I thank you for the flattering likeneſs you have drawn of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0465000101:20"/>
me; may there be a ſtill ſtronger reſemblance between us, in our love and eſteem for lady Woodville!</p>
            <p>I THINK you extremely happy in meeting with ſuch an amiable friend, in ſo agreeable a neighbour. She will, I doubt not, be kind enough to inform you of the <hi>Carte du pais,</hi> where you are ſituated: and what is of infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more conſequence to your happineſs, ſhe may acquaint you with the particulars of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's temper; for be aſſured, all charming as he is, that he has ſome, the knowing and treating of which properly, may be the ſureſt baſis of your future felicity.</p>
            <p>SIR John ſet out for Paris, laſt Monday, and, in an hour after, Mr. Ranby inoculated Lucy and my dear children. Though I have the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reliance on the goodneſs of Providence, and the fulleſt conviction of the general ſucceſs of this opperation, the mother could not ſtand it. I was forced to retire to my cloſet. I repented my not having acquainted Sir John, with my deſign, and thought, that if any mifortune ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to either of the children, even his grief would ſeem a conſtant reproach to me.</p>
            <p>IN this ſituation of mind, I poured forth my ſoul in fervent prayer, before the throne of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. My apprehenſions vaniſhed, the rectitude of my intentions confirmed my reſolutions, and I felt myſelf perfectly calm, and reſigned. Amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing efficacy of true devotion! But indeed, my dear Emily, there is no other reſource for the afflicted. No other balm to heal the wounded ſoul. By this, and this alone, we are enabled to triumph over pain, ſickneſs, diſtreſs, ſorrow, even death itſelf.</p>
            <p>THE children are in a fine way, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the infection. Lucy, it is thought, has
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0465000101:21"/>
not. She inſiſts upon being inoculated again, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow. Sir James ſupped with us, on Sunday night; and told us with a grave face, that he ſhould not ſee us again, till his affair was quite over; for if he viſited here, he could go no where elſe. I laughed and bid him ſtay away, if he could.</p>
            <p>THOUGH I did not think him ſerious, he has hitherto kept his word, but ſends a formal card, every day, to enquire of our healths. I ſee that his behaviour hurts Lucy, though ſhe affects not to take notice of it. I hear he ſpends all his time with Miſs Nelſon. She is artful and agreeable. I begin to fear poor Lucy's preſage may be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>ADIBU, my deareſt Emily, I ſhall not write to you again, till I can congratulate you on the perfect recovery of our invalids. Till then, and ever, I am,</p>

            <p>THE devil's in it, if the honey moon is not over yet, and you near half a year married. This is carrying on the farce too far, and looks as if you wanted to make us infidels believe, that pleaſure was to be found in the ſober and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcheme of matrimony.</p>
            <p>I ALLOW your wife to be handſome. I will ſuppoſe her lively, and agreeable too; but then, have you not had time enough to be tired of all theſe perfections? and whenever that happened,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0465000101:22"/>
the more merit a woman has the greater our diſlike.</p>
            <p>I SHOULD never forgive a wife that did not ſupply me with a reaſon for hating, when I grew weary of her. But I fancy I need not be in any manner of pain on that account; for the preciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>YOU will, perhaps, tell me, that lady Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville is a very different kind of woman, from thoſe I hint at. It may be ſo; and I will admit it. But prithee, Harry, is ſhe not your wife? And in that comprehenſive term, are not reſtraint, care, limitation of pleaſures, and ſqualling brats, included? But love her, if you will, and as long as you can: but, believe me, the only way to keep ſuch a ſickly flame alive, is by the fuel of abſence.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, order your horſes directly, and leave her, where ſhe ſhould ever remain, ſixed to the freehold; while you ſhine forth, once more, among your old friends, at the Shakeſpear.

You are no libertine, Thornton, and yet ſeem to take pleaſure in adopting their groſs, and contemptible ſentiments.</p>
            <p>THEIR general abuſe of women is truly ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous: they pretend to know them, without having ever converſed with any, but that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſpecies of them, whoſe minds and manners are a diſgrace not only to their ſex, but to human nature itſelf. Profligates firſt betray to infamy all the women they can deceive; and then, by a double injuſtice, judge of the ſex, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples they have made.</p>
            <p>BUT come, my young friend, and convince yourſelf that happineſs is to be found in a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous connection with an amiable and agreeable woman. Order your horſes, directly, I ſay; and leave your groſs errors where they ſhould ever remain, in Covent Garden.</p>
            <p>I NEVER was a member of any ſociety at the Shakeſpear, though I have ſpent ſome evenings there, both pleaſantly and innocently.

            <p>BUT one ſad truth I muſt pour into your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, from mine, that almoſt burſts while I repeat it. The lovely, the angelic Charlotte Beaumont, has fled from theſe fond arms, and taken refuge in a convent! I beheld her renounce the pomps, and vanities, of that world, which ſhe was born to adorn.

            <p>THIS ſingle conſideration will, I am certain, be a more powerful preſervative to your generous heart, than all the philoſophic reaſonings in the world; which too well I know, were never yet proof againſt ſtrong paſſion.</p>
            <p>ADIEU, my friend: that you may continue to deſerve and poſſeſs, every happineſs this world can give, is now the warmeſt wiſh of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy</p>

               <hi>Lord</hi> WOODVILLE, to <hi>Lord</hi> SEYMOUR.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My dear, unhappy Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM truly ſorry that I had left London be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your arrival.—Had you given me the leaſt hint of your intentions to return, I ſhould certainly have ſtaid to meet you: and I would, at this moment, fly to pour the balm of friendſhip into your wounded boſom, but that Sir James Thornton, whom I have invited to ſpend ſome time with me at Woodfort, and go with me to York races, came here laſt night.</p>
            <p>HE is quite a ſtranger to lady Woodville, and all this family, and would certainly conſider it as the higheſt breach of hoſpitality, if I were to leave him in the hands of a parcel of <hi>virtuous</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which are a race of beings, that he is totally unacquainted with. He is young, has a very large fortune, and many amiable qualities; but his education has been ſo ſhamefully neglected, that he is in imminent danger of becoming a prey to ſharpers and proſtitutes.</p>
            <p>EVEN you muſt have ſmiled, to have ſeen this young man, who is made up of frolic, and viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, look as frighted and abaſhed, before lady Woodville, whoſe gentleneſs itſelf as a young country lady, who has never been out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily manſion, when firſt preſented at St. James's. But I hope this timid aukwardneſs will wear off in a few days: and as I know nothing that can refine the ſentiments, or poliſh the manners ſo much, as the coverſation of elegant women, I wiſh to keep Sir James, for ſome time, amongſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0465000101:27"/>MY couſin, lady Hariet Hanbury, is here; and a very lively girl, Miſs Weſton, a near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Emily! Your old friend Ransford, ſpends much of his time with us alſo. What would I not give to tempt you hither! You ſhall retire when you pleaſe; read, walk, and muſe alone: and when you are diſpoſed, my Emily ſhall play to you, ſome of the ſweeteſt, ſofteſt airs, the very food of love, accompanied with the ſweeteſt, ſofteſt voice, you ever heard. Harriet, who is of the melancholy caſt, and, I fear, unhappily in love, ſhall ſigh, in concert with you; and Thornton, and Miſs Weſton, ſhall ſometimes make you ſmile.</p>
            <p>I CONFESS to you, my dear Seymour, that I was both ſhocked and ſorry, when I heard that the marchioneſs was in England. Lady Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville was the firſt perſon who informed me of it: but, utterly ignorant of there having ever been any connection between us, ſhe did not perceive my emotion at her name.</p>
            <p>CRUEL woman! does ſhe wiſh again to diſturb the peace of a heart, which ſhe had well nigh broken! but I defy her power.—In lady Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville I have found all that is amiable in the moſt lovely ſex; ſenſible, beautiful, gentle, kind, and unaffectedly good.</p>
            <p>TRUE, ſhe is not miſtreſs of thoſe lively ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of wit, that dazzle the underſtanding, and captivate the heart. Her form, though lovely, has not the ſtriking elegance, the nameleſs, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs graces, that wait on every motion of the marchioneſs!</p>
            <p>BUT why do I ſuffer myſelf to dwell upon her charms? or make a compariſon injurious to the amiable woman, who deſerves my love? why can I not ſay, who poſſeſſes it! Ah, Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour! it is impoſſible to regulate the motions of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0465000101:28"/>
the human heart, by the cold rules of reaſon. Not all the charms of the whole ſex combined can ever render mine ſuſceptible of thoſe ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing tranſports it has already known. Yet let me boaſt, that it is as impoſſible for her, who firſt occaſioned, to revive, as for any other woman, to inſpire them.</p>
            <p>IF this was not the caſe, I ſhould have made a worthleſs preſent to my Emily, when I gave her both my hand and heart: and though I allow the latter not to be an adequate return for hers, ſhe ſhall never be able to diſcover its deficiency, by any word, or action of my life. This I can ſafely promiſe.</p>
            <p>I HAVE purpoſely avoided mentioning your loſt, your lovely Charlotte! When you are more at eaſe, I know you will acquaint me with the particulars of your diſtreſs. Why may not that happy aera be haſtened, by a reliance on all the tender cares of friendſhip, which you may certainly depend on, from</p>

            <p>YOUR letter has added to the affliction I am already involved in. I think I am fated never to poſſeſs any of thoſe bleſſings, without which life is a burthen. The object of my fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, tendereſt wiſhes, already torn from my bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart; there remained yet one conſolation; a generous, and affectionate friend; and he, in human ſuicide, is going to rob me of himſelf! what an hard lot is mine! all that I ever loved, devote themſelves; and by their miſery, I am twice undone!</p>
            <p>BUT ſtop, my friend; and let my warning voice prevent your ruſhing down the precipice! you muſt not, ſhall nor, ſee the marchioneſs. I will go to Woodfort, though heaven knows how unfit to mingle in ſociety, merely to prevent your going to York races.—The Syren will be there.—</p>
            <p>I WENT, laſt night, to pay a viſit to my ſiſter, lady Sandford, and there I met your lovely ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. She aſked many queſtions about you, but many more about lady Woodville, and wanted me to draw her picture. I told her that I had not ſeen her, for ſome years; that ſhe was then extremely young, but had, I thought, a very near reſemblence to her ladyſhip, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing her a perfect beauty.</p>
            <p>I SAID this, to prevent her finding fault, which ſhe certainly would have done, had I attempted a particular deſcription. She ſaw through my deſign, but would not let me triumph in the ſucceſs of it, then ſmiling ſaid,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Like
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0465000101:30"/>
me! perhaps that was the reaſon he choſe her.—Conſtant creature! this is a compliment, for which I think myſelf more indebted to him, than for all the fine things, he ever ſaid, or wrote to me."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I HOPE, madam, his lordſhip had other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"O fye, lord Seymour, how you love to mortify? but pray let me indulge my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity a little. As the man is married, and to a perfect beauty too, there can be no danger in avowing my ſenſibility of his regards. This, you know, I never did, while he was ſingle, and I might have hopes. But woman have ſtrange caprices.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"HOWEVER, I can aſſure you I have not the leaſt deſign upon his heart. It would be the height of vanity, indeed to attempt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valling this <hi>perfect beauty.</hi>"</q>
It would be the height of cruelty, madam, but to wiſh it.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I declare I cannot ſee it in that light, my lord; for ſuch a woman can never want adorers."</q>
Our married ladies, madam, ſeek for that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, only in their huſbands.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Nay now, my lord, you want to impoſe on me, as I am a ſtranger; but you cannot deceive me, for I know numberleſs inſtances to contradict your aſſertion, and not one to prove it. And I really think that London is as much the ſeat of gallantry, as Paris."—</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE arrival of other company gave the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation a general turn; but what I have repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is, I think, ſufficient to make you fly from a woman, who audaciouſly owns her deſigns againſt your peace. As ſhe talked of going to York, my ſiſter, who is to accompany her, requeſted I would let her have my houſe, which I readily aſſented to; but were it unemployed, I would refuſe it to my dear Woodville.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0465000101:31"/>YOU ſee the ſnare is laid, and will you ſelfdevoted ruſh into it; I know you, Woodville, you cannot live with loſs of honour, and it is impoſſible to preſerve your's, if in your preſent ſituation, you can be again drawn in, to doat upon this—But I will not abuſe her. I ſhall ſet out for Woodfort to morrow, and there enforce every argument I have uſed to preſerve you from yourſelf,</p>

            <p>I CANNOT tell my deareſt Fanny how much her laſt letter affected me; nor can I ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently expreſs my admiration of that happy turn of mind, that enables you to triumph over every difficulty and diſtreſs, and to riſe ſo far ſuperior to what any one might reaſonably expect, from the gentleneſs of your nature, on every trial.</p>
            <p>HOW happy is it for your poor weak Emely, that ſhe has had nothing to ſtruggle with! ſhe would have ſunk beneath the ſlighteſt weight, and give a looſe to tears, and to complainings. But let the goodneſs of that all-wiſe Providence, who proportions our trials to our ſtrength, fill my heart with the warmeſt gratitude, and let me <q rend="inline">"ever bleſs, and praiſe his name."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE no ſort of doubt but you are eaſed of all a mother's fears, by this time, and that the dear little ones are prattling round you, with their uſual chearfulneſs; while you feel, even an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0465000101:32"/>
tenderneſs from recollection of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they have paſt.</p>
            <p>I HAVE very uneaſy apprehenſions for poor Lucy: I almoſt wiſh ſhe may not receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.—There have been numberleſs inſtances of perſons who never had the ſmall pox; and I think it is like forcing nature to make a ſecond effort.</p>
            <p>I DETEST Sir James Miller; and hope, with all my heart he may never be married to Lucy, as I am very ſure he never will deſerve her.</p>
            <p>OUR family party has received ſome very agreeable additions ſince I wrote laſt. There is a moſt delightful contraſt between our viſitors. Sir James Thornton, lively, boyiſh, with a good natural underſtanding, totally unimproved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt idea of good breeding;—and yet, that want is amply ſupplied, by what I call na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural politeneſs. But if <q rend="inline">"good breeding is the bloſſom of good ſenſe,"</q> we ought to find out ſome other term, for that ſpecies of form, which is only to he acquired in courts. There was ſuch an aukward reſerve about poor Thornton, for the firſt three days he ſpent at Woodfort, that I looked upon him as a Hottentot: but that rough caſt is now worn off, and he is really agreeable, and entertaining.</p>
            <p>LORD Seymour, our lateſt gueſt, is, really, an accompliſhed gentleman; an elegant form, and affable countenance, beſpeak your favour, at firſt ſight, and his every word and action inſenſibly engage your regard. Yet, laviſh as nature has been to him, there ſeems to be ſomething want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his happineſs. There is a tender air of melancholy diffuſed over his whole form, with ſuch a ſoftneſs in his voice and manner, as is rarely natural to the gay ſons of proſperity. His
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0465000101:33"/>
fortune is ample, and his birth high; it muſt then be that ſource of the moſt poignant ſorrow, ill-fated love, that has diſturbed his peace. Yet, I think, he could not love in vain, unleſs there was a prior prepoſſeſſion. I long to know his ſtory: I feel myſelf intereſted, as for a brother.</p>
            <p>HE acquainted my lord with his intentions to viſit us, the night before he came. We were all engaged to dine at Sir Harry Ransford's, the next day; and her ladyſhip had got the old knight to conſent to her having a ball. My lord remained at Woodfort to receive his gueſt. I accompanied the young folks to Sir Harry's.—After tea, I intreated lady, Ransford to excuſe my leaving her, without taking any notice of it to the company. She was ſo obliging as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and I drove home directly.</p>
            <p>MY lord ſeemed ſurprized, and pleaſed, at ſeeing me; and, as he handed me from the coach, ſaid, with an air of the utmoſt tenderneſs, I am much obliged to you for your attention to my friend; and can with truth aſſure you, that your company is the only agreeable addition that could be made to our preſent ſociety. My little heart exulted at the kindneſs of this compliment; as to pleaſe, or oblige him, is, and ever will be, its higheſt ambition. Notwithſtanding this, I thought my company was a reſtraint on them, and therefore retired ſoon after ſupper.</p>
            <p>IT was four o'clock, when my lord came up ſtairs. I was miſerably apprehenſive he was ill, as he ſighed often, and was uncommonly reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. But my fears are now fled, like a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dream.—He ſeemed perfectly well at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. Lord Seymour and he are gone into the gardens.</p>
            <p>THE coach is juſt returned with the boys and girls; and Thornton is, this moment, come
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0465000101:34"/>
into my dreſſing-room, to tell me <hi>all about it,</hi> as he expreſſes himſelf: but he is too civil to ſpeak, till I leave of writing. I muſt, therefore, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſilence on myſelf, to relieve him from it; and ſo bid my dear ſiſter,</p>

            <p>I WAS vaſtly pleaſed with my dear Emily's letter.—There is infinitely more merit in looking up to the Almighty, in our proſperity, than adverſity. Praiſe is ſurely the nobleſt, and, of courſe, the moſt acceptable ſacrifice that a human creature can offer to the great author of good. Mr. Addiſon very juſtly obſerves, that
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"a mind, which has the leaſt turn to religion, naturally flies to it in affliction."</q>
We then feel our own inſufficiency; we are humbled by ſorrow, and perhaps only then deduce real ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from a thorough conviction, that there is a ſuperior Being, whoſe aid is graciouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to thoſe who ſincerely ſeek it. But, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the delights of life, youth, fortune, gaiety, and diſſipation, we too frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come forgetful of the ſource, from whence our bleſſings flow; and while we are indulging all our appetites in the delicious ſtream of happineſs, it becomes impregnated with the qualities of Lethe, and renders us unmindful of its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>BUT let me be truly thankful, that the ſiſter of my love, the child of my care, is not only
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0465000101:35"/>
bleſſed with the inſignia of happineſs, but with a heart capable of the firſt virtue, gratitude; which, I hope, will enſure to her the long, and full poſſeſſion of all earthly good.</p>
            <p>I NOW can tell my dear propheteſs, her hopes are accompliſhed.—The mother's fears are loſt in the happy certainty of my children's perfect recovery.—But the friend ſtill ſuffers:—poor Lucy continues extremely ill, though, thank God, this day pronounced out of danger. The ſmall-pox was as favourable to her, as poſſible; but the emotions of her mind, on account of that wretch, Sir James Miller, has thrown her into a violent fever.</p>
            <p>HE is, this day, to be married to Miſs Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon! This ſhe is yet ignorant of; but on the firſt day that ſhe ſat up, ſhe received a kind of leave-taking letter from him, excuſing his perfidy, by her want of complaiſance to his requeſt. Said,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"he had reaſon to apprehend, that a lady, who ſeemed ſo little inclined to oblige him before marriage, would not make a very complying wife;—that he was glad to hear her beauty out of danger, as there was no doubt, but it would procure her a better huſband than him; and that he ſhould endeavour to look out for a wife, who was leſs anxious about her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures."</q>
Was there ever any thing ſo provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! This is adding inſolence to baſeneſs!</p>
            <p>IF Sir John was here I am ſure a duel would enſue.—I know not how to act in this affair.—I cannot bear the thoughts of his triumphing in his villainy; nor yet can I think of hazarding Sir John's life, to puniſh ſuch a ſcoundrel. Swift ſays,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"The <hi>occaſions</hi> are few, that can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a man of ſenſe and virtue to draw his ſword."</q>
I am certain, were he living, he would allow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be a juſtifiable <hi>one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0465000101:36"/>BUT as a wife and mother, I moſt ſincerely hope, Sir John may never hear of his infamous behaviour: but what excuſe to invent, for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the match, I know not. Sir John is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his honour, and will inquire minutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the affair. I will refer it all to Lucy's pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: ſhe loves her brother, and is a chriſtian.</p>
            <p>YOU are an admirable painter. I ſhould have known lord Seymour's picture, if you had not ſet the name to it; all but that ſhade of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, which you had thrown over it. He was extremely lively when I knew him; but I have not ſeen him, ſince his return to England.</p>
            <p>YOU have made me perfectly acquainted with Sir James Thornton: I ſaw his precipitate ſtride into your dreſſing-room, and his ſhort ſtop on finding you were writing. It reminded me of the ſnapping of a watch-ſpring. Have you ever had one break in your hand? Lucy has juſt awoke from a refreſhing ſleep, and, on being told I was writing, ſhe deſires to ſee me immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.—I will return to you, again.</p>
            <p>WHAT an affecting interview! That odious idiot, Sir James Miller, has,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"like the baſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, thrown a pearl away, richer than all his tribe."</q>
When I went into Lucy's chamber, ſhe deſired every one to withdraw: then taking my hand, and preſſing it to her lips, what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite trouble muſt I have given to the compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate heart of my dear lady Straffon! but I hope you do not deſpiſe me: it was the weak ſtate of my body, that overpowered my mind. But now, that I have recovered my ſenſes, I am amazed how I could be affected by the loſs of ſuch a man.—Did I ſay loſs? then I fear, I rave again. But I grieved for an ideal character; and am much obliged to Sir James, for removing the miſt from before my eyes, and ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0465000101:37"/>
in his native colours. How happy the deluſion vaniſhed ſo ſoon! Had it continued but a little longer, I ſhould have been a wretch indeed! What a miſery, to deſpiſe the man, whom it is our duty to love and honour! Yet ſuch might have been my fate! ſhould I have been unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donably criminal, my deareſt ſiſter?</p>
            <p>I INTREATED her not to think upon the ſubject, but to calm her ſpirits; and that I would converſe with her on any other topic, that ſhe pleaſed.—She begged my attention for a few minutes; ſaid ſhe had wandered from her purpoſe, and aſked my pardon for detaining me. You are writing, lady Straffon; perhaps to my brother. Then raiſing herſelf on her knees, in ſpite of my efforts to hinder her, let me, in this humble poſture, intreat you, my deareſt ſiſter, not to mention what has paſſed to Sir John. I know his natural bravery, joined to his love for an only ſiſter, would tempt him to call Sir James Miller to an account.—Good God! what might be the conſequence! He has done me no wrong; and ſhould any misfortune happen to my brother from this event, I could not anſwer for my ſenſes. And were even the aggreſſor, for ſuch indeed he is, to fall, I never ſhould know peace again.</p>
            <p>HERE ſhe was quite overcome by weakneſs, and ſunk down in a ſtood of tears. I ſaid every thing in my power to aſſuage her grief; and gave her the ſtrongeſt aſſurances, that I neither did, or would mention a ſyllable of the affair to Sir John. She told me then, I had reſtored her tranquility; and ſhe ſhould ſoon be well, and able to contrive ſome plauſible pretence to her brother, for breaking off the match: and as this would be the firſt falſhood ſhe had ever told him, ſhe hoped it might be conſidered as a <hi>pious fraud,</hi> only.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0465000101:38"/>AFTER this converſation, ſhe grew perfectly compoſed; I left her retired to reſt: but I fear ſhe has diſturbed mine, for this night. What an amiable heart is hers? While yet ſmarting with undeſerved wounds, ſhe would preſerve the cruel wretch who inflicted them! I will religiouſly keep my promiſe to her; yet cannot help ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely wiſhing, that his crime may be his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and, I think, he bids fair for being overpaid in kind.</p>
            <p>MISS Nelſon, now lady Miller, is at leaſt twenty-nine, and has been a remarkable coquette theſe ten years; yet never could catch a poor unguarded fly in her net, till Sir James ruſhed in.—She was perfectly acquainted with his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to Lucy; had requeſted to be her bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid; yet could think of ſeparating them for ever! May they be mutual avengers of each other's perfidy!</p>
            <p>I FEEL myſelf in an unchriſtian mood; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it; I pity folly, but deteſt vice! Alas! my Emily, I am too ſevere; for they are, in general, ſynonimous terms. I will, in charity, wiſh you good night; for if I write on, I ſhall rail more: therefore, Adieu,</p>

            <p>I AM ſo violently provoked at the inſolent baſeneſs of that abominable Miller, that I cannot find words to expreſs my reſentment. I do not think you ſeem ſufficiently rejoiced at
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0465000101:39"/>
Lucy's eſcape from ſuch a monſter: for my part, I am delighted at the thoughts of his being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to ſuch a woman as Miſs Nelſon—May ſhe render him juſt as miſerable as he deſerves to be!—His greateſt enemy could not wiſh him worſe.</p>
            <p>BUT there are more wretches in the world, than he; and Lucy is not without companions in affliction. The willow grows on purpoſe for our ſex; and were it to be watered, only by the tears drawn from beauteous eyes, by the perfidy of men, it would need no other moiſture. Poor lady Harriet! an accident has diſcovered the cauſe of her too frequent ſighs</p>
            <p>YESTERDAY morning after breakfaſt, when the gentlemen had retired to their ſeperate amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, lady Harriet, Miſs Weſton, and I, were in my dreſſing-room. Lady Harriet took up Prior's Poems, and was reading Henry and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, to Fanny and me, who were at work; when in ruſhed lady Ransford, in a riding dreſs, and begged I would permit her to introduce a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, an acquaintance of her's, whom ſhe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally met on the road, as ſhe was coming to ſpend the day with me. She concluded, he was a particular friend, whom ſhe had not ſeen for a long time. I immediately conſented; and ſaid I was ſorry my lord was not at home, to receive the gentleman.</p>
            <p>SHE ran out directly, and led in Captain Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.—While ſhe was preſenting him to me, the book fell from Lady Harriet's hand, and ſhe ſunk motionleſs upon the couch. As ſoon as the captain caſt his eyes on her, he appeared almoſt in the ſame condition: the colour forſook his lips, and he could hardly breathe. Lady Rans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford looked with a ſpiteful kind of aſtoniſhment, and cried out, What can all this mean! is ſhe ſubject to fits? Fanny, and I, were engaged in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0465000101:40"/>
trying to recover lady Harriet, I began to fear in vain—Life ſeemed, for ſome minutes, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely fled—The wretched captain looked the picture of deſpair.—The moment ſhe opened her eyes, he bowed, left the room, mounted his horſe, and rode off.</p>
            <p>WE conveyed lady Harriet to her chamber, and laid her on the bed; when a plentiful ſhower of tears ſeemed to have relieved her. I left Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Weſton with her, and returned to lady Rans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. She ſeemed in a violent paſſion, that the captain was gone—What has he to do with lady Harriet's faintings? She was very ſure it was only an air ſhe gave herſelf. She thanked God, ſhe was not ſubject to ſuch tricks. She never fainted in her life, and was quite certain ſhe never ſhould, &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I CONGRATULATED her on the goodneſs of her conſtitution; ſaid lady Harriet's was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delicate, and that ſhe had not been well for ſome time. This did not ſatisfy her; and ſhe continued out of humour at the captain's deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the whole day; ſeveral times repeating, I do not ſuppoſe he ever ſaw her before; of what conſequence was her fainting to him? and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged her in this opinion, though far from believing it.</p>
            <p>I SAID, his retiring was a mark of politeneſs, as the preſence of a ſtranger muſt increaſe the confuſion we were in. Nothing that I ſaid could pacify her. I therefore ſuffered her to mutter out her diſſatisfaction without replying, for the remainder of the time ſhe ſtaid, which was not long after dinner.—She ſaid ſhe ſhould be afraid to ride with only one ſervant, after it was duſk.</p>
            <p>I NEVER was better pleaſed with the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a gueſt. I longed to ſee poor Harriet,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0465000101:41"/>
who had not left her rooom, and flew to her the moment lady Ransford was gone. She looked abaſhed, and held down her lovely eyes, which were yet bathed in tears, when I approached her;—but the tenderneſs with which I inquired concerning her health, ſeemed to re-aſſure her.</p>
            <p>YOU are too good to me, my dear lady Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville; ſuch weakneſs as mine ſcarcely deſerves your compaſſion: and I can only preſume to hope for it, by the moſt unbounded confidence, which I ſhould long ſince have repoſed in your friendly boſom, but that I thought it cruel, even for a moment, to interrupt that happineſs which you ſo well deſerve. But as the accident which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened this day, muſt convince you, that there is a ſecret ſorrow which preys upon my heart, I will readily acquaint you with the cauſe of it, leſt the tenderneſs of your nature ſhould make you imagine me more wretched than I really am.</p>
            <p>YOU muſt ſuppoſe, my dear, ſaid I, that your ſituation, this morning, alarmed me extremely; but I have long thought there was ſome ſecret ſource for that ſoft melancholy, which you vainly endeavour to repreſent as conſtitutional. But do not let this remark make you think yourſelf under a neceſſity of diſcloſing your ſecrets to me. I am far from deſiring to pry into them: but ſhould rejoice at having it in my power to do any thing, which might alleviate your diſtreſs. And if my participation of your ſorrow can footh it, but for a moment, it will more than repay me, for what I feel, in knowing that you are unhappy.</p>
            <p>SHE ſaid, ſhe was not then capable of making the leaſt return to my kindneſs, though perfectly ſenſible of it; but that, as ſoon as ſhe was able, ſhe would write out her ſhort ſtory for me, and lady Straffon. She ſaid, Lucy knew ſomething of it, but not the whole; and deſired ſhe might
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0465000101:42"/>
ſee it, as a kind of conſolation under her preſent circumſtances</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I receive, I will ſend it to you. Pray preſent my love to Lucy, and tell her, I intreat her company at Woodſort, whenever ſhe is able to travel. Change of air, and objects, will forward her recovery. Why cannot you, and the little ones, accompany her, and complete the wiſhes of</p>

                           <p>AS the ſtrongeſt mark of my ſincerity and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, to my dear lady Woodville, for all her kindneſs to me, I ſit down to fulfil the voluntary promiſe I made, of acquainting her with the few events of a ſhort life, whoſe duration has only been marked by ſorrow; and as, <q rend="inline">"to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to ſuffer pain,"</q> I choſe to ſave her gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heart the uneaſineſs of ſeeing the diſtreſs, which the recollection of unhappy circumſtances, muſt ever revive, where the ſufferer is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later. I muſt now, like all biographers, ſtep a little back, to give you ſome account of the authors of my being, and then proceed with a plain narrative, ſubmitting my weakneſſes and follies, without the leaſt reſerve, to your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eye.</p>
                           <p>MY father was eldeſt ſon to the Earl of G—. During my grandfather's life, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came paſſionately in love with my mother, who was a daughter of colonel Stanley's, and reputed one of the greateſt beauties of that time. My father well knew it would be in vain to hope for the earl's conſent to his marrying, without a large fortune, let the merits of the lady be ever ſo great; as his eſtate was extremely involved, and that he had four children by a ſecond wife, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided for.</p>
                           <p>MY mother's portion was only four thouſand pounds, but her father, who conſidered her birth, beauty, and accompliſhments, as full equivalents to any fortune, when he found the earl was not acquainted with my father's courtſhip, forbade his daughter ever to ſee her lover more, as his pride would not ſuffer him to have matched her with a prince, clandeſtinely.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0465000101:44"/>THE lovers reduced to this unhappy ſituation, after much fruitleſs ſorrow, had recourſe to the uſual alternative, and married without conſent on either ſide. The affair was not long kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and the earl, whoſe rage was without bounds, accuſed the colonel of being privy to the marriage, and of drawing in his ſon—he alſo laviſhed every kind of abuſe upon my mother, and ſtopt the allowance he had for ſome years given to my father.</p>
                           <p>THE colonel, though highly offended with his daughter, reſented the cruelty and injuſtice of the earl's behaviour, and ſent him a challenge—The duel was prevented by my father's addreſs, but the moſt implacable hatred ever remained, between the old gentlemen; which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated itſelf to every branch of the families, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my father and mother, who were the moſt perfect patterns of conjugal tenderneſs.</p>
                           <p>NOTWITHSTANDING my father's encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fondneſs for his lovely wife, the unhappy feuds, which ſhe thought herſelf the occaſion of, preyed on her tender mind, and ſo much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened her delicate frame, that, giving me life, ſhe loſt her own;—fatal exchange for her unhappy orphan! My father was quite diſtracted at her loſs, and the colonel, who had been reconciled to them both, for ſome time, was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain his own affliction, to endeavour to conſole my father, and engage him to preſerve his life, by frequently preſenting me before him.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q rend="inline margQuotes">"YES, he would then ſay, I will live for the protection of that only tranſcript of my angel Harriet. I will watch over her riſing virtues, and endeavour to reſtore to the world, ſome part of that perfection, my cruel father has deprived it of."</q>
For four years, his fondneſs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0465000101:45"/>
for me <hi>was</hi> unabated, and I appeared to be the ſole object of his attention and regard.</p>
                           <p>ABOUT that aera, the earl wrote to him, and a reconciliation ſoon enſued; the terms of which were, that as my father had gratified himſelf by his firſt marriage, he ſhould oblige the earl, and ſerve his family, by a ſecond. My father, whoſe nature was gentle, was ſoon induced to comply, and, as I believe his real fondneſs for my mother, had rendered all women indifferent to him, the choice of his future lady was entirely left to the earl, who, you may ſuppoſe, would rate her va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, only by her fortune. My father paid his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes in form, and even without the leaſt degree of liking on either ſide the match was concluded.</p>
                           <p>THE perpetual ſcenes of diſcord which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to this ill-ſuited marriage, are but too pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and I have great reaſon to apprehend, that, to this conſtant ſource of domeſtic miſery, I owe the loſs of my unhappy father. The firſt cauſe of diſguſt, my ſtep-mother gave him was her abſolutely refuſing to let me be brought into the houſe, politely adding, that ſhe would not ſuffer a <hi>beggar's brat,</hi> to be brought up with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who were at leaſt entitled to a fortune, by their mother's ſide; and that thoſe who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their blood to boaſt of, ſhould be bred humble to lower their pride. This one ſpecimen is, I think, ſufficient to give you a perfect idea of my poor father's unhappineſs, and I ſhall ſay nothing more, of one, who has the honour to bear his name, and title.</p>
                           <p>I REMAINED at my grandfather's, and was his principal favourite. My father continued to ſee me frequently, and, notwithſtanding his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was increaſed, by the birth of a ſon, and two daughters, his fondneſs for me appeared undimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed—but neither his lady, nor the earl, ever
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0465000101:46"/>
took the leaſt notice of me—my father's ſiſter, lady Woodville, was extremely kind to me, and even preſſed my grandfather to let me live with her, but he refuſed to part with the only joy he had on earth, and ſhe died before him.</p>
                           <p>WHEN I was about fourteen, I was deprived of my affectionate, and tender parent, the good old colonel.—Before he died, he recommended me, in the moſt affecting terms, to my father, who promiſed every thing in my favour, that he could deſire; but ſeemed offended that the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel ſhould think it neceſſary to plead for his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, beſt beloved child, the child of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the child of his ever adored, and lamented Harriet. Fully ſatisfied with theſe aſſurances, the good old man reſigned his ſoul in peace, leaving me all his perſonal fortune, which amounted to about ſix thouſand pound; his paternal eſtate being entailed on a male heir.</p>
                           <p>LADY Anne Weſtrop, who was a diſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of my mother's, invited me to live with her, and in the ſociety of this agreeable woman, I began to recover my natural chearfulneſs, which had been totally obſorbed by the grief I felt for my grandfather's ill health and death.—During a year, that we paſſed entirely at her ſeat in the country, I knew not one moment's uneaſineſs—my mind was like a peaceful ocean, whoſe every motion was uniformly gentle, without one ruffling breeze to diſturb, or deform it; yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently actuated to prevent languor or diſguſt, the ſtagnation of the ſoul.</p>
                           <p>How often have I looked back, with regret, upon this pleaſing calm! which was, alas! too ſoon ſucceeded by impetuous ſtorms, where all my peace was ſhipwrecked. About the end of this happy aera, captain Barnard came to pay a viſit to his ſiſter, lady Anne; he is youngeſt ſon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0465000101:47"/>
to the Earl of W—. He was deſigned for the navy, and his father was at that time ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing a ſhip, which he ſoon obtained for him. I ſhall not take up your ladyſhip's time, by giving you an account of our childiſh courtſhip, but tell you, at once, that,

                           <p>IN the midſt of theſe truly Arcadian pleaſures, the earl, my grandfather, died; which I can by no means ſay diſturbed my happineſs; but alas! it was to be interrupted by a ſeverer ſhock; for my father ſurvived him but eleven days; the ſix thouſand pounds, which colonel Stanley had bequeathed to me, were in my father's hands, his eſtate was all ſettled upon the iſſue of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond marriage, and his debts amounted to rather more than his perſonal fortune; ſo that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained not a ſhilling for me, even of my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's legacy, without going to law with the counteſs, my ſtep-mother, who had poſſeſſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of every thing my father left.</p>
                           <p>I GRIEVED only for his loſs, that of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune appearing, then, of <hi>no</hi> conſequence; my lover ſeemed to redouble his tenderneſs for me, but thought, circumſtanced as I then was, it would be prudent to conceal our paſſion, as it was highly probable, his friends might oppoſe our union. I acquieſced in his opinion, and reſted all my
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0465000101:48"/>
hopes of happineſs on him,—unworthy guardian of that ſacred truſt!</p>
                           <p>WHEN the time for his leaving the Weſt-hill arrived, I then diſcovered that I had never known ſorrow before; it was impoſſible to conceal my anguiſh, and lady Ann Weſtrop, who had taken great pains to comfort me for the death of my father, and imagined, not without reaſon, that my grief had ſubſided into a calm, and gentle me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, ſeemed aſtoniſhed at the violence of my affliction; but I might have anſwered her with the words of Helena,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I think not on my father, and theſe great tears do grace his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory more than thoſe I ſhed for him"</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>HOWEVER, I thought it very lucky, that my late misfortune appeared a ſufficient cauſe for my preſent melancholy, which I indulged to ſuch an exceſs, as ſoon affected my conſtitution, and I was ordered by my phyſician to Briſtol Lady Anne, ever kind, and affectionate towards me, accompanied me thither, and Mr. Weſtrop went to London, to conſult lawyers about the recovery of my fortune.</p>
                           <p>THE frequency and tenderneſs of captain Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard's letter contributed much more to the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of my health, than all the waters of thoſe ſalubrious ſprings; and lady Anne expreſſed ſuch ſincere joy at my recovery, that I, romantic as I was, thought myſelf bound in honour, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her with the real cauſe of it. I thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing any thing from ſuch a friend, was <hi>acting a lie,</hi> and in the fullneſs of my gratitude I poured forth all the ſecrets of my heart</p>
                           <p>SHE heard me with that ſort of coldneſs with which one liſtens to a twice told tale, yet, at the ſame time, aſſured me, ſhe had never ſuſpected any attachment between her brother and me; ſaid ſhe wiſhed, for both our ſakes, we could

conquer our paſſion, for ſhe was certain it could only be productive of miſery to both.</p>
                           <p>I WAS equally piqued at her manner and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and replied with ſome warmth, that as I conſidered myſelf under very great obligations to her, I would not entail miſery on any part of her family, let my own fate be what it would. She applauded my reſolution, with the ſame <hi>ſang froid,</hi> with which ſhe had heard my ſtory, and I retired from her apartment, to my own, more humbled and mortified than I had ever been in my life.</p>
                           <p>I PASSED a moſt reſtleſs, miſerable night, ſometimes reſolving on the higheſt generoſity to break with captain Barnard,—the next moment repeating vows of everlaſting love—but at all events I determined to quit lady Anne, yet whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould I go? where fly to? a wretched or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, without friends or fortune!</p>
                           <p>THE agitation of my mind at length ſubſided, and towards morning I fell into a profound ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. As I ſlept much longer than uſual, I found lady Anne's woman by my bed ſide, when I awoke, who ſaid ſhe came from her lady, to inquire my health, and to requeſt that I would go to her immediately.</p>
                           <p>I OBEYED the ſummons inſtantly, and while I was hurrying on my cloaths, flattered myſelf that ſhe had relented of her unkindneſs, and wiſhed again to reſtore me to that ſiſterly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which ſhe ſeemed ſo long to have felt for me, and yet to have loſt in one moment; poſſeſſed with this imagination I ran, or rather flew to her apartment but on opening the door, was ſurprized to ſee Lord N—, who appeared very earneſt in converſation with her ladyſhip.</p>
                           <p>THIS gentleman had been very particular to me, ever ſince our reſidence at Briſtol; he was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0465000101:50"/>
young, polite, and maſter of a large indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fortune; but theſe advantages had made me rather decline, than encourage his acquaintance, leſt the buſy tongues of men, or rather women, might have pronounced him a lover—an epithet, which is of all others moſt hateful to a delicate, pre-engaged heart.</p>
                           <p>On my entrance, the converſation became general. Lady Anne affected to treat me with her uſual tenderneſs, but I too plainly ſaw, that ſhe only affected it. After ſome little time ſhe withdrew abruptly, and left me alone with lord N—. A thouſand diſagreeable things ruſhed into my mind at once, but above all, I feared a declaration of love from his lordſhip, which, though I was determined to refuſe, muſt have diſtreſſed me extremely, as I could not to the world, aſſign any juſtifiable cauſe for my refuſal.</p>
                           <p>I ROSE from my ſeat with trepidation, and rang the bell for breakfaſt. I hoped this would be a hint for his lordſhip to retire—on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he ſaid, it was very fortunate for him that I called for tea, as he had not touched any thing but a glaſs of water, that day, and ſhould have abſolutely forgot that eating was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, if I had not reminded him of it; but ſince I had, he hoped I would allow him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of breakfaſting with me.</p>
                           <p>I COOLLY bowed aſſent, and the moment the tea table was removed, ſaid I muſt retire, to put on my riding dreſs, as I had promiſed to meet a lady on the downs, and feared I ſhould keep her waiting. Lord N— ſaw my confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, pitied and believed it, by ſaying he would not treſpaſs farther on my leiſure, but hoped I would permit him the honour of paying me a viſit in the afternoon: he did not wait for my reply, and I thought myſelf infinitely obliged to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0465000101:51"/>
him, for even poſtponing the embaraſſment, in which I knew I ſhould be too ſoon involved.</p>
                           <p>AS ſoon as lady Anne and I were alone, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner ſhe congratulated me, with a ſerious air, on the important conqueſt I had made, enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated the great advantages of ſuch a match, and ſaid ſhe was rejoiced to find, by the eaſe and propriety of my behaviour, that the ſilly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion I had talked of the night before, had not rendered me ſo romantically abſurd, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject happineſs, and lord N—, or to perſiſt in embracing miſery, and captain Barnard.</p>
                           <p>THOUGH I had in ſome meaſure prepared myſelf to hear her ſpeak on this ſubject, yet I could not avoid feeling the utmoſt ſurprize at her want of delicacy, in mentioning the man whom I profeſſed to love, at the ſame inſtant that ſhe approved my accepting of another.</p>
                           <p>AS ſoon as I recovered myſelf, I told her that I was neither intitled to her congratulation, or approbation, as lord N— had never ſaid any thing upon ſuch a ſubject to me, and that I hoped he never would, as I ſhould be very ſorry to give him the mortification of a denial; but at the ſame time, that I fled from what <hi>ſhe</hi> called happineſs, I hoped I ſhould find what I thought ſo in the conſciouſneſs of having acted right; for though I never could diveſt myſelf of the tendereſt attachment to captain Barnard, yet I could ſacrifice my hopes of any future connection with him to his advantage, and her deſire.</p>
                           <p>LADY Anne took me at my word, praiſed my generoſity, and intreated I would take time to conſider, before I refuſed lord N—. I aſſured her, that delay was unneceſſary; and as I had a very high eſteem for his lordſhip, and was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely grateful, for the honour he intended me, I could not think of trifling with his peace, or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0465000101:52"/>
meanly accepting a heart, becauſe ſet in gold, when it was abſolutely impoſſible for me to make the only return which ſuch a valuable preſent deſerved. She called me dear, romantic, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous girl; ſaid ſhe had no doubt but time and reaſon would conquer my childiſh paſſion, and that ſhe ſhould rejoice to ſee me happy with ſome worthy man; but ſtill intreated me, not to act precipitately, with regard to lord N—, as ſhe feared I might never have ſuch another offer.</p>
                           <p>THIS kind of converſation laſted till lord N— came to viſit us, and I now wiſhed for his making that delaration I ſo much dreaded in the morning. I was determined, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct I ſhould purſue towards him, and ſecretly triumphed in the ſacrifice I ſhould make to my truly diſintereſted love for captain Barnard. However, her ladyſhip took care that we ſhould not ſo immediately come to an explanation, for ſhe never left us the whole evening. Lord N— appeared to be chagrined; and I was alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely mortified that the affair was not brought to a concluſion.</p>
                           <p>THE next day, I received a letter from Mr. Weſtrop, informing me that my ſtep-mother had conſented to give me four thouſand pounds, rather than ſtand a law ſuit, for the ſix which my grand-father left me. In conſideration of this ſum, I was to relinquiſh all farther claim to my father's fortune, and to receive it as a preſent from her bounty. Theſe terms I thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hard; but to attempt carrying on an expenſive ſuit, without money appeared imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable. It is true, Mr. Weſtrop in the moſt friendly manner, offered to advance any ſum I might have occaſion for; but I already felt the <hi>weight</hi> of my obligation to lady Anne, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to increaſe <hi>the load.</hi> I therefore
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0465000101:53"/>
complied with theſe ſevere conditions: but as I was not of age, Mr. Weſtrop became ſecurity for my part of the contract, and the intereſt of this ſplendid ſum was allotted for my mainte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                           <p>ON this occaſion, lady Anne behaved with the utmoſt kindneſs towards me; begged I would conſider her as my ſiſter, and never think of quitting her houſe, till I went to one of my own. She made me ſeveral valuable preſents, which I received with the utmoſt reluctance; yet could not refuſe, as her manner of beſtowing them was peculiarly polite and tender. In ſhort, ſhe did every thing in her power, to conciliate that true eſteem, and affection, which her conduct, with regard to captain Barnard, had for a while reſtrained.</p>
                           <p>LORD N— ſoon found an opportunity to diſcloſe his paſſion for me; and I as quickly put an end to all his hopes. He thanked me for the generous frankneſs of my conduct, and earneſtly intreated to ſee me as a friend, though I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him as a lover. I readily conſented to his requeſt, and have ever found him a moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy man.</p>
                           <p>I HAD not received a letter from captain Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard for near a month.—He was ſtationed in the Mediterranean: and though determined, sa ſoon as he returned to England, to take an everlaſting leave of him, I grew impatient at his ſilence, and longed to return to Weſthill, to retrace thoſe paths we had trod together, and woo ſweet echo to repeat his name. I knew lady Anne received foreign letters frequently, ſome of which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed were from captain Barnard; but as ſhe was ſilent on the ſubject of them, I did not think it proper to appear inquiſitive; and ſome weeks elapſed, without ſuffering that name to paſs my
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0465000101:54"/>
lips, which was but too deeply engraved on my heart.</p>
                           <p>AT length the time for our departure came, and we arrived at Weſthill.—The morning after, I roſe very early, in order to indulge the fond idea of reviſiting thoſe woods and lawns, where I had ſpent ſo many happy hours. I did not imagine any of the family were ſtirring, and went ſoftly into lady Anne's dreſſing room, where all the Engliſh poets lay, to take a book with me into the garden. I ſtarted at finding her there. Her ſurprize at ſeeing me, equalled mine: but quickly recovering herſelf, ſhe talked of the fineneſs of the morning, which ſhe ſaid had tempted her to leave her bed ſo ſoon; but that finding the dew was not off the graſs, ſhe had ſat down to write letters.</p>
                           <p>A PROPOS, ſaid ſhe; I have had one in my poſſeſſion for you theſe ten days; but as I did not know whether the contents might be perfectly agreeable to you, I choſe to defer delivering it, till we were quite free from obſervers. I flatter myſelf, madam, ſaid I, that your precaution was unneceſſary, if, as I apprehend,, the letter comes from captain Barnard. Lady Anne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, do not be too ſanguine, my dear; we feel our diſappointments, in proportion to our expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. True, madam, I returned; but as the height of mine at preſent, extends only to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your brother is well and happy, do not protract on that account, but be ſo good to let me have my letter.</p>
                           <p>SHE then preſented it to me, ſaying, I believe you had better retire to your own apartment, before you read it. I willingly obeyed: but though all this preparation was ſufficient to alarm me, yet at the ſight of thoſe dear, well known characters, I forgot all that lady Anne had ſaid,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0465000101:55"/>
and broke the ſeal with the higheſt tranſport. But before I had read half the following lines, I in reality ſuffered the transformation, which Ovid ſeigned for Niobe: my limbs were petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; nor was the leaſt ſign of life or motion, remaining in me, but my flowing tears.</p>

                                 <p>UNWORTHY Harriet! you might have ceaſed to love, without betraying, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the wretch who doated on you.

                                 <p>It is now above two months ſince I have heard from you.

                           <p>I HAD remained for ſome hours in the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation I have already deſcribed, when lady Anne ſent her woman, to call me to breakfaſt. On finding my eyes fixed, and my whole frame immoveable, Mrs. Atkins ſcreamed ſo loud, that lady Anne and Mr. Weſtrop ran into my dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-room. I was immediately put into bed, and every care was taken for my recovery. A ſlow fever enſued, which I daily hoped would termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate my life and miſery; but it pleaſed Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that I ſhould be reſerved for greater woes.</p>
                           <p>AS ſoon as I was capable of reaſoning, I found captain Barnard had been impoſed upon, and felt even more for his ſufferings than my own—But who could have deceived him? it muſt be lady Anne. But as I was not in a ſituation to reſent ſuch cruelty, I thought it moſt prudent to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in ſilence, and wait till time, the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0465000101:57"/>
of myſteries, ſhould clear my innocence. She frequently obſerved, that as I was determined to break with him, it would be better to let him remain in his error, than to come to an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that could anſwer no end, as we were to part for ever. To this I could, by no means, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. But, alas! it was not in my power to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her pleaſure. I neither knew the name of his ſhip, nor the place of his deſtination; and I continued, for near twelve months, a prey to the moſt cruel ſuſpenſe.</p>
                           <p>AT this time lady Anne and Mr. Weſtrop pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed making the petit tour, and inſiſted on my accompanying them.—I gladly accepted the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; for I might truly ſay,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I had ſuch perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſource of diſquiet, in my own breaſt, that reſt was grown painful to me, and a ſtate of agitation, only could afford me caſe, by reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing me, as it were, from myſelf."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>THOUGH we ſpent a month in London, to wait for the concluſion of the peace, I knew not where to make any enquiry after captain Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard; nor had I a friend to whom I could ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to repeat his name; and I ſet out for Paris, much more inclined to enter into the moſt gloomy ſolitude than to partake of the pleaſures of that gay city.</p>
                           <p>THERE I became acquainted with lord Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, and there I alſo met Mrs. Bolton, who was nearly related to me, by my mother.—We had been acquainted from our infancy, and had a real friendſhip for each other; but her living in Ireland, where her huſband had a very large fortune, had prevented our meeting for three years before. She was in a very declining ſtate of health, and was going to Montpelier on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, when Mr. Bolton was obliged to ſet out for Ireland, on the death of a near relation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0465000101:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>AS lady Anne was conſtantly engaged in the grande monde, I ſpent much of my time with Mrs. Bolton, and with real ſorrow ſaw that ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able woman growing worſe every day.—Her phyſicians, at length, had her removed to Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainbleau.—Juſt then lady Anne grew weary of Paris, and reſolved to purſue her route. Poor Mrs. Bolton ſhed a flood of tears, when I talked of quitting Paris, and intreated me not to leave her, <q rend="inline">"a helpleſs ſtranger in a foreign land."</q> Even her own maid had married one of the <hi>gens d'armes,</hi> and leſt her, ſo that he had not a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture about her, that had the leaſt regard or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for her. She ſaid, a few days would put an end to the arduous taſk ſhe required from my friendſhip, that of cloſing her dying eyes: but that if Mr. Bolton ſhould return before that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, her carriage and ſervants ſhould convey me to lady Anne, or wherever I deſired.</p>
                           <p>THERE was no reſiſting her importunities; and lady Anne, though diſſatisfied at my ſtay, applauded the nobleneſs of my friendſhip, and took a very affectionate leave of me. I ſaw her get into a carriage with ſincere regret. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered myſelf as torn from one who had been the friend and protectreſs of my youth. Her cruelty was forgot; and every act of kindneſs ſhe had ever ſhewn me, returned with double force into my memory; and my heart and eyes overflow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed with grateful tenderneſs.</p>
                           <p>I WAS waiting in this ſituation of mind, for Mrs. Bolton's chariot to carry me to Fontain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau, when captain Barnard entered the room! I will not pretend to deſcribe the emotions of my heart; in ſhort they were too ſtrong for my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſuſpended all its powers.—Never ſure was ſuch a meeting! The extremes of love, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, reſentment, joy, all operated on me.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0465000101:59"/>HE was all penitence, and love; kneeled at my feet, and bathed my hand with tears; plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the violence of his diſtracted love, in excuſe for the cruel letter he had wrote, when he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me falſe; and uttered the moſt ſolemn vows, that it I would again receive his heart, which never had ſtrayed one moment from me, no power on earth ſhould ever part us more: but if I refuſed to accept his love, he would inſtantly give up the command of his ſhip, and retire to ſome part of the world, where he ſhould never be heard of.</p>
                           <p>I WILL frankly confeſs, that all my tenderneſs for this unworthy man returned; and I even thought I loved him better than I had ever done before. He was then of age, and maſter of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; there remained, therefore, nothing to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>our</hi> wiſhes, for I own them mutual, but the obligations I was under, and the voluntary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe I had made to lady Anne. This objection he treated as romantic; but ſaid, he would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify my delicacy in this particular; and engaged to obtain her free conſent.</p>
                           <p>HE attended me to Fontainbleau, and viſited me there, every day, during two months, that my amiable friend continued to languiſh.—At the end of that time, ſhe was releaſed, and left me in ſincere affliction. Mr. Bolton returned a few days before her death; and, ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, made me a preſent of part of her jewels, to the amount of two thouſand pounds.—I would have declined ſo valuable a gift; but it was my dear Mrs. Bolton's dying requeſt, that I ſhould have them.</p>
                           <p>AT captain Barnard's earneſt intreaty, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Paris, where he ſtill continued to ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit our marriage, and I to refuſe, till he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled his promiſe, with regard to lady Anne.—

                           <p>HE would not hear of my returning into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land till we were married. I had no parent's conſent to aſk, and he had wrote to the chaplain of his ſhip to come and marry us. Seemingly poſſeſt with the tendereſt paſſion that ever warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a human heart, he ſet out for Aix la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle, where we ſuppoſed lady Anne to be; but, unluckily. ſhe had left it two days before captain Barnard arrived, and was then returning to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Thither the captain followed. I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely concerned at this diſappointment; but it was only on account of the additional trouble and fatigue he was to undergo.</p>
                           <p>HE wrote to me the very poſt: nay, I was ſometimes ſo happy, as to receive two or three letters wrote at different times of the ſame day, filled with the language of love, with fond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of abſence, and vows never to leave me more.</p>
                           <p>HOWEVER, blinded as I was by my own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I could not help perceiving, that when he had been ſome time in England, the ſtile of his letters began to change, though he ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to complain of the cruel neceſſity that detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; but not in that charming plaintive ſtile, which uſed, at once, to ſoften and delight my heart.</p>
                           <p>THREE months paſſed away, in this manner, during which time, I received a cold, but civil letter from lady Anne, congratulating me on
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0465000101:61"/>
the conſtancy of my lover, and thanking me for the needleſs compliment I had paid her, as ſhe was perfectly convinced we were too much in love, to follow any perſons advice but our own.—Notwithſtanding this, ſhe very ſincerely wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my happineſs, whether I ſhould, or ſhould not become her ſiſter.</p>
                           <p>AS I found captain Barnard's return was ſtill protracted by his father's ill health, and many other reaſons, that did not appear to me ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, I began to be uneaſy at my ſituation.—A ſingle wowan, without friends, or relations, in ſuch a place as Paris, was, by no means, in an eligible ſtate.—I had ſome acquaintance, and thoſe of diſtinction, who received me on lady Anne's account, without inquiring into the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of my ſtay: but I felt a conſciouſneſs, that their civilities were more the effect of politeneſs, than eſteem, which rendered me unhappy; and I wrote to captain Barnard, requeſting his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to return to England, if he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to come to Paris immediately.</p>
                           <p>MY letter lay ſealed, and directed, on my dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-table, when lord N— came to make me a viſit; and caſting his eyes on the letter, ſaid, I might ſpare myſelf the trouble of ſending it to the poſt-office, as he had that moment, met cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Barnard, in a very fine equipage. My heart ſunk in me, at this news.—Yet I ſtill flattered myſelf, that lord N— might miſtake ſome other perſon for him, and was earneſt in perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his lordſhip, that he was deceived, when the captain's ſervant brought me the following card.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q rend="inline margQuotes">"IF lady Harriet H— will be at home, and alone this evening, captain Barnard will, if agreeable, do himſelf the honour of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on her, at ſix o'clock."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0465000101:62"/>THE ſurprize I had been in before was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by this extraordinary meſſage. I, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſent word I ſhould be glad to ſee him; and paſſed the intermediate hours in endeavouring to prepare myſelf for that fatal change, which was already but too viſible, but which I was utterly unable to account for.</p>
                           <p>AT the appointed time, he came, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to aſſume a ſort of formal tenderneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an air of gravity, and myſtery. I could not long endure ſuch a cruel ſtate of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, and preſſed to know what it was that affected him? he told me, he was the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man breathing, that all his ſchmes of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs were blaſted, but that he never could have reſolution to tell me, how they were ſo—called me, dear, ſuffering angel! kiſſed my hand and wept.—</p>
                           <p>I CANNOT deſcribe the emotion of my heart; I longed, yet feared, to know what all this meant; and, at length, told him, that if he did not wiſh to make me extremely unhappy, he would explain this enigma. He ſaid, he had great reaſon to fear, that ſatisfying my inquiries, would render me yet more wretched, even than doubt could do; and if the ſecret could be kept for ever from me, he would die rather than reveal it. But I muſt know it, and he who was a ſharer in the misfortune, would tell it with moſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                           <p>HE then conjured me, to ſummon all the love I ever had for him, that it might incline me to pity, and pardon a wretch, that had undone him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! in ſhort he told me, that his friends had prevailed on him to marry Miſs S—, whom he unfortunately met at Aix la Chapelle, and accompanied to London—that at the moment he received her hand, the icy one of death would
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0465000101:63"/>
have been more welcome; that his heart did, and ever ſhould adore me, and only me.</p>
                           <p>HE had knelt by my ſide, while he told this fatal ſtory, and when he finiſhed it, wept ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely. To his amazement, not one ſigh or tear eſcaped me. I roſe immediately, and wiſhed him joy, then rung the bell to order my chariot; he remained immoveable, I begged he would riſe, before the ſervant entered—he obeyed; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored me not to leave him; ſaid it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that I could really be ſo indifferent as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; that he was prepared to meet my anger, or my ſorrow, but could not bear contempt.</p>
                           <p>I TOLD him, that was at preſent my predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant ſentiment, and the ſooner he retired from it, and put an end to this interview, the better, and which I would take care ſhould be our laſt. He vowed he would never leave the ſpot, where he again proſtrated himſelf, till I pronounced his pardon. I told him this was adding inſult to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, but ſince he would not quit my apartment, I ſhould.</p>
                           <p>I THREW myſelf into my carriage, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered myſelf to be carried to the marchioneſs de St. Aumont's—there I met lord Woodville, and lord N—; who both remarked that I looked extremely ill, and adviſed me to leave the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and return home. And I ſoon found myſelf really ſo, that I was obliged to follow their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                           <p>I WENT immediately to bed, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſyllable, even to my maid, who obſerving ſo ſudden a change in my manners and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſat up in my dreſſing-room. The heroiſm of my conduct towards captain Barnard, had flattered my pride, and kept up my ſpirits, while he was preſent: but I was no ſooner alone, than I felt all the weight of my misfortunes; and the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0465000101:64"/>
agitation and diſtraction of my mind threw me into convulſions. My maid had immediate help for me, but all the art of the beſt phyſicians in Paris, could not reſtore my ſenſes for fifteen days—happy interval! delightful receſs from ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing ſorrow.</p>
                           <p>AT length, their cruel kindneſs triumphed ſo far, as to reſtore my reaſon—but, good God, in what a ſhattered plight did it return! and to what a poor, defaced, and wretched habitation? my diſorder was generally believed to be a malignant fever, but doctor L—, who underſtood the maladies of the mind, as well as body, and was acquainted with my attachment to captain Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, contributed to the recovery of the latter, by adminiſtering conſolation to the former, much more, than all the art of medicine could have done. I ſoon diſcharged all my phyſicians, but him, who only knew the ſource of my complaint; and to his ſkill and tenderneſs am I indebted, for the preſervation of this wretched being.</p>
                           <p>DURING my illneſs, lord Woodville, and lord N—, behaved like brothers to me—they both viſited me daily, and endeavoured, but in vain, and unknowing of the cauſe, to diſſipate that melancholy, which will for ever prey upon my heart. My mind was ſo much weakened, that I determined to go into a convent, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered myſelf, that in that calm retirement, I ſhould find peace and reſt. I fancied I might there retain the tenets of my own religion, only conforming externally to theirs.</p>
                           <p>I COMMUNICATED my project to doctor L—, who ſoon convinced me, that peace dwells not in a cloiſter, but that even thoſe holy retreats are filled with vain wiſhes, and tumultuous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and that it would be making a mockery
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0465000101:65"/>
of all religion, to pretend to embrace theirs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I could do it ſincerely.</p>
                           <p>WHILE I remained in a very weak and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing condition, a gentleman called frequently to enquire my health; but as he refuſed to leave his name, I gueſſed it was ſome perſon ſent by captain Barnard, and was therefore not the leaſt inquiſitive about him. At length he deſired to be admitted to ſee me, ſaying, he had ſomething of importance to communicate.</p>
                           <p>I CONSENTED; and after the common civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were over, he took a pacquet out of his pocket, and preſenting it to me, ſaid, he hoped that would be an acceptable preſent. It was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in an unknown hand; but as I heſitated about receiving it, he ſaid I had nothing to fear from the contents, and he would call for my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the next day; and inſtantly left the room.</p>
                           <p>THE Pacquet contained a long letter from captain Barnard, filled with vain excuſes for his falſehood, and paſſionate intreaties that I would again ſuffer him to plead his pardon at my feet—he expreſſed the moſt poignant ſorrow for my illneſs, and begged I would at leaſt permit him to repair the injuries he had done me, as far as it was poſſible, by accepting an unlimited power over that fortune, to which he had ſacrificed his love, honour, and happineſs; and as a proof of my forgiveneſs, requeſted I would receive an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed bill for five hundred pounds; but if my pride ſhould ſtill reject his penitence, he deſired I would return his letters, by the gentleman that was the bearer of that.</p>
                           <p>THIS freſh inſult rouſed all my reſentment againſt him, and I paſſed a reſtleſs night, count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the clock, and with impatience waiting for the hour when I ſhould reſtore his inſolent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, with the ſcorn it merited.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0465000101:66"/>AT length, his ambaſſador arrived, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, or ſeemed to be ſurprized, when I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the purport of the letter he had brought me; and made many apologies for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwittingly offended—ſaid the affair between captain Barnard and me had been repreſented in a very different light to him: that he underſtood there had been a ſlight quarrel between us, and that the letter he brought, was to be the means of a reconcilement.</p>
                           <p>CRUEL Barnard, mercileſs man! was it not enough to make me wretched! why ſhould he endeavour to make me infamous alſo! I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the note, and put the letter which had encloſed it, into the fire. As to thoſe I had formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from captain Barnard, I told his friend I would readily part with them, when he ſhould have reſtored mine; but as I had no reaſon to have the leaſt reliance on his word, I would not give them out of my poſſeſſion, on any other terms. He applauded my reſolution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.</p>
                           <p>I LONGED impatiently to leave Paris, and fancied I ſhould recover my peace, by quitting the ſcene of my unhappineſs.—I was obliged to part with ſome of the jewels, which Mrs. Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had left me, to defray the expences of my illneſs and journey; and in a ſtate of the loweſt weakneſs both of mind and body, I returned to London.</p>
                           <p>ON my arrival, I found that a maiden aunt of my father's, who had never taken the leaſt notice of me, during her life, had bequeathed me her whole fortune, ten thouſand pounds; merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was her nameſake, and unprovided for by my father. This was a very happy addition to my confined circumſtances; but I was incapable of joy, and continued to live like a recluſe, till
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0465000101:67"/>
lord Woodville's return to England.—He ſoon found me out, and did me the honour to preſent me to lady Straffon, and his lovely Emily.</p>
                           <p>IN this charming ſociety, I began to recover my tranquility, and flattered myſelf that it was well nigh eſtabliſhed, till the unlucky accident, which brought captain Barnard to my ſight, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me, that there is no cure for ill-fated love; ſince neither the cruelty I have experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, nor time itſelf, have yet been able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it.</p>
                           <p>I WILL not now, my dear lady Woodville, take up more of your time, by apologizing for the weakneſs of my conduct through this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py affair; for

            <p>I HAVE a thouſand thanks to give my dear Emily, for the pleaſing though melancholy entertainment, which lady Harriet's hiſtory has afforded me.—When I was very young, I uſed to be ſurprized that ſo many tragedies and novels were founded on the perfidy of men: but I have for ſome years paſt, been perfectly convinced, that moſt of the miſeries in this life, owe their being to that fatal ſource. And were there but a window in every fair boſom in the cities of London and Weſtminſter, we ſhould diſcover numberleſs hidden traces of the barbarous tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, of thoſe doughty
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Heroes, famous and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0465000101:68"/>
renowned for wronging innocence, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vows:"</q>
and among this deteſtable corps, I think captain Barnard might lead the van, and Sir James Miller bring up the rear.</p>
            <p>YOU may ſee, by this diſpoſition, that I think worſe of the captain than the baronet, as I think lady Harriet much more unhappy than Lucy. However, I ſincerely hope they may both ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount their afflictions: for time and reaſon can do more, in theſe caſes, than the ſufferers are willing to allow. They are patients that do not wiſh to be cured; and find a degree of pleaſure in indulging their malady.</p>
            <p>I AM of opinion, that when diſappointed love ſubſides into a calm and gentle melancholy, its ſenſations may not only be pleaſing to the perſons that feel it, but render them more amiable than they would otherwiſe be, by giving a peculiar ſoftneſs, both to their form and manners. I think I ſhould be more apt to fall in love with a perſon ſo circumſtanced, than with one who had never felt <hi>la belle paſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE great pleaſure in telling you, that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy daily gains ſtrength, both of mind and body; and I by no means deſpair of a perfect cure. The moſt favourable ſymptom is, her not having mentioned Sir James theſe two days; yet have I not once reſtrained her on the ſubject, as ſhe has lately ſpoke of him with great calmneſs. I have not yet ſhewn her lady Harriet's memoir.—Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs like ſorrow is contagious; and the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their ſituations, might call forth tears, which, though ſet down to the account of friendſhip, would certainly flow from her own ſympathy.</p>
            <p>IT is utterly impoſſible for me to have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of viſiting Woodfort this ſummer.—I expect Sir John in a very few days.—As ſoon as he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0465000101:69"/>
we ſhall go into Eſſex.—I do not think Lucy ſufficiently recovered to quit her nurſe, as ſhe calls me.—My little Emily and Edward are quite well, and ſurprizingly grown ſince their ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>I LONG to know what became of captain Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, the day he left you; and, what connexion he coud have with lady Ransford; who, from your account, ſeems not to be one of thoſe, who were born to weep over the willow.</p>
            <p>I SUPPOSE you will ſoon ſet out for York.—The lovely marchioneſs is to be there.—Is lady Lawſon to be of your party? I could wiſh ſhe were; as I fear my dear Emily may not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently attentive to her preſent ſituation.—Let me entreat you not to ride, and to dance but little.

            <p>I AM not half ſatisfied with my dear Fanny's <hi>no comment</hi> on lady Harriet's affecting ſtory.—By making the caſe general, you ſeem inclined to leſſen the calamity.—But a plague is a plague, though ten thouſand, or only one thouſand, die of it; and, by extending its dominion, you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the fatality, without abating our compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for particular ſufferers.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, and again, I ſay, what a bleſſed, happy creature is your Emily! Had my dear lord after gaining, trifled with my heart, his triumph
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0465000101:70"/>
would ſoon have been complete; for I really think the firſt wound muſt have ſubdued it. But he, who has penetration enough to ſee the ſoftneſs of my nature, has alſo generoſity ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my very wiſhes; and ſeems to have no fear, but want of power to gratify them. This is a theme, on which my grateful heart could dwell for ever; but not to tire you, I ſhall change the ſubject.</p>
            <p>I FIND lord Seymour vaſtly averſe to our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to York.—He has taken ſo much pains to diſſuade me from it, that if I had not promiſed Fanny Weſton, and Sir James Thornton, whoſe hearts are ſet on going, I ſhould find great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſacrificing my own inclination to his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.—Yet he gives no ſolid reaſon, for our declining his party.—I perceive that <hi>my</hi> lord looks grave, when the ſubject is mentioned; of courſe, it is immediately dropped; and I find the boys and girls will be conquerors.—Even the grave lady Harriet, and Mr. Ransford, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be alarmed while the matter appeared doubtful.</p>
            <p>I THINK I have as little curioſity, as any of my ſex, yet I confeſs myſelf anxious to know lord Seymour's motive.—He is a man of ſuch excellent underſtanding, and true politeneſs, that I am aſtoniſhed at his thinking differently, even upon this trifling ſubject, from <hi>my lord!</hi> But avaunt! thou firſt female vice, curioſity! I will not ſuffer thee to harbour one moment longer in my breaſt, thou inhoſpitable tenant! diſturber of the peaceful manſion that receives thee!</p>
            <p>LADY Lawſon will not accompany us to York: ſhe has been confined to her chamber for ſome days, with a fever on her ſpirits. A young lady whom ſhe took into her houſe, a diſtreſſed orphan, five years ago, and treated with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0465000101:71"/>
the utmoſt tenderneſs, has juſt left her. This is unlucky, as ſhe is ill, and alone. Sir William ſet out for London yeſterday, without calling upon us.</p>
            <p>THE moment I have quitted one dear ſiſter, I ſhall fly to the other, and ſpend as much time as I poſſibly can with her. Should ſhe continue ill, it will prevent my going to York. I ſhall be only ſorry for the occaſion, for I have loſt all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for the party.</p>
            <p>I KNOW not what became of captain Barnard, the day he left us; but I hear he is a conſtant viſitor at Ransford-hall.—The old knight is laid up in the gout; and her ladyſhip acts in the double capacity of maſter and miſtreſs of the family.</p>
            <p>I HOPE Sir John is by this time, returned to you full of love, and joy and admiration, at your amazing proweſs, with regard to his children; and that you are all as happy as you deſerve, and I</p>

            <p>AS I have been uſed from my infancy, to your tender participation of all my pains, and pleaſures, I could not reſiſt my inclination of ſending you the incloſed, which afforded me the moſt charming <hi>melange</hi> of both, that I have ever met with. I am proud, and pleaſed, that the writer was a woman; but cannot help lamenting that ſuch noble ſentiments, ſuch an elegant turn of mind, and above all, ſuch tender ſenſibility, ſhould be buried in a cloiſter.</p>
            <p>NOW for the means by which I obtained this treaſure.—Yeſterday evening, after tea, the converſation turned on the ſubject of letter-writing. Lord Seymour advanced, and was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by <hi>my lord,</hi> that ladies in general, wrote better in the epiſtolary ſtile than men.—As I looked upon ſuch a declaration, rather as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment paid to the preſent company, than their real ſentiments, I took up the argument: and though they mentioned ſeveral inſtances of charming female ſcribes, all of whom I admire, as much as they, yet would I not allow the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit general:—for thoſe very perſons, whom they quoted, are or ought to be, as much diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of their ſex, for their ſuperior ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, as lady C—, or the dutcheſs of H—, for their uncommon beauty.</p>
            <p>LORD Seymour politely called me an heretic, againſt ſelf conviction; ſaid he had obſerved my frequent uſe of the pen, and was perſuaded that no perſon, with half my underſtanding, was

ever fond of writing, who was not conſcious of writing well. I told his lordſhip if the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation became particular, there muſt be an end of the general argument. He bowed, and went on with repeating ſome paſſages from female let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which did honour to his taſte, and with which we were all charmed.</p>
            <p>HE then told us, that he had a letter in his pocket, which he looked upon to be the <hi>chef d'aeuvre</hi> of female eloquence; that he had found it as he was one morning taking a ſolitary walk in the Tuilleries; that he would permit me to read it, provided I would candidly give him my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whether I thought any man living could dictate ſuch a letter. On my promiſing to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, he took it out of his pocket-book, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to me, with a trembling hand, and left the room.</p>
            <p>WHEN we met at ſupper, I was laviſh in its praiſe, and declared, that I doubted whether even Rouſſeau could have wrote more tenderly. He ſeemed delighted at my converſation, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately complied with my requeſt, to ſuffer me to take a copy of it, for you, and you only.</p>
            <p>I IMPATIENTLY long to know ſomething more of the lady's hiſtory.—I cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that it was mere accident which put it into lord Seymour's hands.—But I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you from the peruſal of it by my vague conjectures—I ſhall, however, ſatisfy your curioſity in a more material point, by letting you know lady Lawſon is better.—I am to dine with her, tête-á-tête, to-morrow.</p>
            <p>I SHALL claim great merit for this volunteer. I hope Lucy continues well. I earneſtly wiſh to know what apology you have made for that worthleſs idiot, Sir James Miller to Sir John.

                                 <p>AFTER a conflict of four months, the mildeſt moment of which ſad time, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more painful, than that which ſhall ſeparate this feeble frame from its perturbed ſpirit, I ſit down to bid an everlaſting adieu to him, who was far dearer than the firſt, and long maintained the ſcale in equal balance with the latter. Did I ſay <hi>was?</hi> alas! he is, and ever will be, dearer than my life! which I would ſacrifice, a thouſand times, rather than wound his heart, as I now muſt.</p>
                                 <p>UNHAPPY Henry! what pangs, what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh will now rend thy boſom, when thou ſhalt be convinced, thou never hadſt a rival in thy Charlotte's love! Even heaven itſelf yielded its claim to thee; and my fond heart adored the Maker in his moſt perfect work, thy charming ſelf! Such, in thy Charlotte's eyes, didſt thou appear, till thy relentleſs jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy purſued, and would have robbed of life—no rival, Henry! but thy Charlotte's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!</p>
                                 <p>HOW will amazement ſtrike thee! My ſad heart bleeds for thine. Involved in myſtery, and myſery from my birth, this truth could not have reached you ſooner; nor could I poſſibly reveal the ſecret, and brand with cruelty and guilt, the authors of my wretched being.</p>
                                 <p>RECALL the fatal evening to your mind when that accurſed jealouſy infuſed its venom firſt into your boſom—what pains did I not

                                 <p>AH! Henry, how could you doubt her truth, who never yet deceived you! by what you now muſt feel, judge what I felt, when word was brought me, you had killed my brother! that he ſurvives, for your ſake, and my own, I bow my heart to heaven. Ah! what uncommon miſery were mine, were I compelled to hate you! No, Henry I am not ſo wtetched; I may love you ſtill, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a crime; moſt truly love you; and every prayer that I addreſs to Heaven, may waſt petitions for your true felicity!</p>
                                 <p>TO-MORROW, I renounce the world; vain ceremony! Alas! I have renounced my Henry, before.—This is my laſt adieu.—May every ſaint and angel, bleſs, protect and guide you, to that heaven, where we may, once more, hope to meet!—Till then, farewell, for ever.—</p>

               <hi>Lady</hi> STRAFFON, <hi>to Lady</hi> WOODVILLE.</head>
            <p>I AM vaſtly obliged to my dear Emily, for her two laſt letters—her volunteer was delightful—that angelic nun has almoſt broke my heart—it is impoſſible ſhe can be happy in a cloiſter,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0465000101:76"/>
and I very much doubt, whether thoſe fine feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which ſhe ſeems to have, would not have rendered her rather more miſerable, had ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the world. May ſhe ſoon arrive at that place, where the higheſt ſenſibility muſt be productive of the higheſt happineſs!</p>
            <p>YOU will, perhaps, think me cruel, for wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her death; but indeed, my dear ſiſter, there is ſcarce a man living, who could deſerve ſuch a heart as hers; not even lord Seymour, to whom I believe it devoted. If I read aright, I am trully ſorry for his misfortune; he has ſuſtained an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable loſs.</p>
            <p>I DARE ſay your lord is acquainted with the whole ſtory; and as I am perſuaded that lord Seymour is incapable of a baſe, or mean action, he may, perhaps, be prevailed on, to ſatisfy your curioſity—but if he once declines it, preſs him no farther. As you value his peace, and your own, never lay him under the painful ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of refuſing any thing to the woman he loves; nor let him ever ſee you have a wiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratified. Believe me, Emily, more women loſe their huſbands hearts, by what they call car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying their point, and teizing a good natured man into compliance, than any other way.</p>
            <p>THE firſt part of this letter, like the Gazette, has been devoted to foreign affairs; now for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic.—Sir John returned laſt week in perfect health and ſpirits, from Paris. I did not ſuffer the children to appear, till I acquainted him with my bold undertaking—at firſt he looked ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and terrified; but immediately recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, ſaid, that from his Fanny's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he was certain our joint treaſure muſt be ſafe. At that inſtant, the little animals flew into his arms; I cannot deſcribe the charming ſcene,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0465000101:77"/>
but it was, as you ſay, all
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"love, and joy, and admiration."</q>
            </p>
            <p>LUCY came next; ſhe had ſummoned all her ſpirits, to meet her brother, but in ſpite of all her reſolution, a wayward tear ſtole down her lovely cheek. To our mutual ſurprize Sir John took not the leaſt notice of her ſoft confuſion, nor aſked a ſingle queſtion about Sir James Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Lucy was vaſtly happy at his ſeeming inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but it alarmed me much more, than if he had ſpoken upon the ſubject.</p>
            <p>A LITTLE time after, he withdrew into his clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and wrote at letter—his ſervant returned as we were ſitting down to dinner, and told him the gentleman was not at home. During our meal, I felt the utmoſt anxiety, but durſt not ſpeak. Lucy was the exact reſemblance of Shakeſpear's patience on a monument, <q rend="inline">"ſmiling at grief."</q> Sir John appeared to be perfectly at eaſe, chearful and lively.</p>
            <p>I OBSERVED to him, that he talked much, and eat little. He preſſed my hand with unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected tenderneſs, and ſaid the joy he felt at ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us all, had quite abſorded any thought of himſelf, but that nature would ſoon return to its old bent, and bid me beware of my beef and mutton to-morrow.</p>
            <p>I KNEW the loſs of appetite to be a common effect of joy, and therefore endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade myſelf, that all was well. When we aroſe from table, he ſaid he had ſome buſineſs to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſact for a gentleman in Paris, but that he ſhoud return to tea, and deſired Lucy to have her voice and harpſichord, in tune, to ſing him ſome new ſongs; he then put on his ſword and walked briſkly out of the houſe.</p>
            <p>LUCY and I remained for ſome moments pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified; we could neither ſpeak, nor lok at each
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0465000101:78"/>
other—at length ſhe aroſe, and with a ſlow peace, and down-caſt looks advanced to where I ſat, then fell upon her knees before me, and bathed my hand with her faſt-falling tears. I could not bid her riſe, but ſunk down by her, and joined in fervent prayer, for my huſband, and her brother's ſafety.</p>
            <p>A THOUSAND times the dear unhappy girl implored my pardon, as though ſhe were the guilty cauſe, of what I did, or might hereafter ſuffer. Her anguiſh ſeemed unutterable; and alarmed and diſtreſſed as I then was, I found it abſolutely neceſſary to conceal my own fears, and ſpeak peace to her diſtracted tortured mind.</p>
            <p>IN leſs than an hour, Sir John relieved us from this ſhocking ſtate—at the tranſporting ſound of his voice, we endeavoured to compoſe ourſelves—Lucy flew to open the door of the parlour, where we had remained during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; ſhe ruſhed into his arms, and fainted there. The ſtrong tranſition overpowered her every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and it was a conſiderable time before ſhe ſhewed any ſigns of life. I do not bluſh to tell you that Sir John wept over his beloved ſiſter.</p>
            <p>AS ſoon as ſhe had power of articulation, ſhe gazed intently on her brother, and exclaimed, Where is the unhappy man? and do I ſee my deareſt brother ſafe, and unſtained with blood?</p>
            <p>MY dear Lucy, Sir John replied, calm your ſpirits—you need have no apprehenſions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Sir James Miller or for me—he is fallen below my reſentment; and you might have been aſſured from the firſt, that any man who dared to treat a woman ill, muſt be a coward in his heart.</p>
            <p>BUT did you meet? cried Lucy. No, ſaid Sir John, and I will anſwer for it, we never ſhall,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0465000101:79"/>
if he can avoid it; and I promiſe you, I ſhall not ſeek the wretch.</p>
            <p>BUT pray, Sir John, ſaid I, how came you acquainted with his ungenerous behaviour? As vice and folly are generally connected, replied Sir John, he was weak enough to inform againſt himſelf by a letter which he wrote to me at Paris, ſome time after his marriage; and concluded it with preſenting lady Miller's compliments, and hoping that notwithſtanding what had paſſed, we might ſtill be friends, and live upon good terms</p>
            <p>IN my anſwer, I told him that though ſighting had formerly been my profeſſion, I was neither a bully nor a bravo, and if he could acquit himſelf with honour, of a breach of faith to a woman of unqueſtioned merit, I was ready to accord him the friendſhip he deſired; but as I looked upon that to be impoſſible, I hoped he would at leaſt be ready to afford me the only ſatisfaction that remained in his power to offer or mine to receive. That I ſhould leave Paris in a few days, and call upon him, as ſoon as I arrived in London.</p>
            <p>I SAW his ſervant near this houſe, when I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and I have reaſon to think he was placed there, to watch my coming; as Sir James and his lady ſet out in a few minutes after for Paris. And I think there now ramains nothing, but to wiſh my dear Lucy joy of her eſcape, from ſuch a contemptible animal.</p>
            <p>I AM, indeed, my dear brother, ſaid Lucy, truly joyful—what a wretch ſhould I have been, if any misfortune had befallen you, on my account? how could I ever have looked upon my more than ſiſter, or her little ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> babes? Sir John and I endeavoured to change the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but Lucy frequently recurred to it.</p>
            <p>AH, Emily! her wounds are not yet healed.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0465000101:80"/>
We ſpent the evening in a kind of pleaſing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy—though our hearts were at peace, our ſpirits were too much agitated to be chearful. I propoſed our ſetting out for Straffon Hill, next day, but Sir John ſeemed inclined to ſtay for a few days longer. As I have now no apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from Sir James Miller, I can have no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, though I confeſs I long for pure air, and peace; two charming things, which are never to be found in a great city.</p>
            <p>I CONGRATULATE you on lady Lawſon's recovery. How does poor lady Harriet? Have you civilized Sir James Thornton? I mean, has he yet fallen in love? What is Fanny Weſton doing? I ſhall think her much to blame, if ſhe does not make a conqueſt—the country is the place to inſpire ſentiment—in London, we think of nothing but outward ſhew—<hi>happineſs</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely out of the queſtion.

            </opener>
            <p>YOU very aptly compare your laſt letter to a news-paper, which records facts indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately—how could you poſſibly think of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0465000101:81"/>
the charming nun, however engaging or affecting her ſituation, and thence proceed to a ſober lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on matrimony, before you mentioned events ſo intereſting, as thoſe which related to Sir John, Lucy, and yourſelf? you are certainly a perfect ſtoic, and I begin to fear you will ſoon be above <q rend="inline margQuotes">"life's weakneſs, and its comforts too."</q> You ſee how gladly I lay hold of the firſt opportunity I ever had, to criticiſe on you. I have no doubt but you will explain away all my objections, by next poſt; but in the mean time, I ſhall fully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that <hi>ſelf given</hi> conſequence, and ſuperiority, which we all aſſume, when we take the liberty of condemning another perſons conduct.</p>
            <p>BUT to be ſerious, both my lord and I are charmed with Sir John—his tenderneſs for his amiable ſiſter ſets his bravery in the ſtrongeſt light—and you really did not bluſh to record it! my dear Fanny muſt have a great deal of effion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, notwithſtanding her modeſt countenance, and her meek air. I am in ſuch high ſpirits, at the happy concluſion of this diſagreeable affair, that I cannot command my pen to write one ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional line.</p>
            <p>YES, it ſhall tell you, that all this family con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate our dear Lucy, and you, but more particularly her, on her lucky eſcape from that contemptible wretch Sir James Miller; and though we all hope, and believe ourſelves to be very good chriſtians, there is not one of us would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his untimely end, if he ſhould be detected in picking pockets in Paris, and make his exit at the <hi>Greve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND ſo my dear wiſe ſiſter very prudently warned me againſt teazing my lord—it was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per caution, and I ſhall uſe it—am not I very obedient? but ſhe left me at full liberty, to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0465000101:82"/>
any one elſe—I ſhall uſe this latitude alſo. To begin:—I muſt inform you, that I am in full poſſeſſion of the hiſtory of our lovely nun, and unreſtrained from communicating it to you; yet ſhall I not gratify your curioſity, which I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is as great as mine, until you are brought to confeſs it; and provoked to ſay, Pſha, Emily, how can you be ſo teizing?'</p>
            <p>I MUST now haſten to your queries, as we are going to dine at lord Withers's, four miles off. I have prevailed on lady Lawſon to be of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Sir William is not returned from London yet I do believe Sir James Thornton is in love, though we cannot gueſs with whom. He is lately become thoughtful and reſerved; we rally him on his gravity, and tell him he is
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"proud, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and gentleman like:"</q>
though he has loſt his chearfulneſs, his good humour is invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, and he ſtrives to laugh, whenever he thinks we wiſh he ſhould.</p>
            <p>I MUCH fear that Cupid has played at croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, amongſt our young folks, and dealt out left-handed arrows. I fear poor Fanny Weſton is a ſtricken deer, and am apprehenſive, that the hand which gave, will never heal the wound. She ſits whole evenings alone in her chamber, liſtening to an Aeolian harp, and ſometimes looks as if ſhe had been in tears. She ſays ſhe will go to London, from York; but I fancy ſhe may as well return to Woodfort, as all our male inmates will have left us.</p>
            <p>LORD Seymour talks of going to the hot wells, at Briſtol, in a few days; and Sir James Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton goes from York, to his own ſeat in the Weſt. Lady Harriet continues pretty much the ſame, except when captain Barnard is mentioned; which happens too frequently, as he ſtill viſits at lady Ransford's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0465000101:83"/>ADIEU, dear Fanny, the coach is ready, and Sir James Thornton waiting in the anti-chamber of the dreſſing-room, to hand me to it.

            <p>IT is a remark, much to the honour of human nature, that happineſs creates benevolence. I am, therefore pleaſed with the illuſtrating it, by telling you, that the calm and rational delight I receive, from my preſent happy ſituation, has rendered my mind ſo placid, and ſerene, as to prevent my reſenting your ladyſhip's ſarcaſtical comment on my laſt letter. <hi>Au contraire,</hi> I am pleaſed at your becoming a critic; as I think you want a little of that <hi>ſelf given</hi> conſequence, which is ſometimes neceſſary, to give us weight with others.</p>
            <p>BUT now to prove to you that I am not ſtoic enough to be indifferent about your good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I muſt inform you, that the firſt part of my laſt letter was wrote a few minutes before Sir John's arrival, the remainder the day after. And as I know my dear Emily's weak ſpirits are too apt to be alarmed, I choſe to proceed in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, in hopes, that by ſeeming to treat the matter lightly, I might prevent her apprehenſions: and this remarkable inſtance of my delicacy, has her
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0465000101:84"/>
pretty little ladyſhip conſtrued into a total want of feeling. But you love <hi>faire la guerre</hi>; and now, look to yourſelf.</p>
            <p>I NEVER pretended to be devoid of curioſity; it is a paſſion inherent to our natures, and, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conducted, may be productive of every good.—It is the ſource of knowledge; and in my mind, the ſtrongeſt mark of diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the rational and brute creation—It is our birth right, deſcended to us from our firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—You will, perhaps, ſay, it is an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance we might have diſpenſed with, as it has certainly coſt us too dear; yet as I have already ſaid, if well cultivated, it is a fruitful ſoil; but, in the hands of the weak, or the idle, it can bring forth nothing but weeds, or thorns.</p>
            <p>AGAINST this kind of produce, I warned my Emily, and ſtill warn her, leſt they, at any time, ſhould wound her tender heart. I frankly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs myſelf intereſted in the fate of your lovely nun; but inſtead of ſaying, as you would have me, Pſha, Emily, how can you be ſo teizing!

            <p>I HAVE heard it ſaid, that a perſon who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learnt to fence, ſhall be able to diſconcert the greateſt maſter of that noble ſcience; nay more, may poſſibly kill him by a random paſs, while he ſtands in the beſt poſture of defence, and is aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his antagoniſt, in all the profundity of quarte or tierce. Juſt ſuch a ſcrambling comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant have you to deal with, who, without the leaſt ſkill in the art of logic, preſumes to enter the liſts with your wiſe ladyſhip.</p>
            <p>AND ſo, Fanny, curioſity is now become a virtue,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"productive of every good, the ſource of knowledge, the diſtinguiſhing mark of rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality, an inheritance deſcended to us,"</q>
&amp;c. And yet poor Emily is not to be allowed the uſe of this treaſure, but to be deprived of her birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and treated as an abſolute alien to our grandmother Eve. Is not this a little hard?</p>
            <p>BUT now what ſays <hi>my philoſophy,</hi> to this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere treatment? I think I ſee you laugh, at that expreſſion. But pray, madam, is not the great
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0465000101:86"/>
uſe and end of that exalted ſtudy, to render us happy, by perfectly acquieſcing in our own lot, and wiſely contemning all thoſe advantages that are denied us? Grant me but this, and I will immediately prove myſelf a philoſopher, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you how differently we think, in regard to this ſame treaſure, called curioſity, which I am not permitted to have any ſhare of.</p>
            <p>AND firſt, I abſolutely deny, that it ever was, or can be, productive of good. <hi>Au contraire,</hi> I have ſcripture on my ſide, to prove that it was the original cauſe of every phyſical, and moral ill, that has happened in this world, for I know not how many thouſand years. You ſay,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"it is inherent to our natures."</q>
Fie, Fanny! Could the Author of good then have puniſhed dame Eve, and all her deſcendants, merely for following the bent of that nature, he had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf endued her with?—Impoſſible!</p>
            <p>I SAY, it was the devil, who firſt introduced it into paradiſe, and infected poor Eve; for it certainly is contagious, and never to be eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. From her then it has deſcended to all her offspring, not as an inheritance though, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as an uncancellable mortgage upon their natural patrimony.</p>
            <p>YOU ſay, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"it is the ſource of knowledge."</q> There again, my dear, you are unluckily miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.—Pride is, undoubtedly, the firſt motive; for not <hi>to be wiſe,</hi> but to be <hi>thought wiſer,</hi> than our neighbours, is the great reward. "A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing mark of rationality. You are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no philoſopher, lady Straffon.—Have you never ſeen a dog, or cat, raiſe up their ears, and liſten with all the avidity with which an old maid hearkens to a ſcandalous report of ſome bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beauty of eighteen? Indeed, my dear, you muſt have obſerved this frequently; and I am

firmly perſuaded, that thoſe animals I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are juſt as inſtinctively curious, as any dutcheſs in Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>I THINK I have now fairly demoliſhed all your arguments in favour of this precious commodity: but as you <hi>boaſt</hi> the poſſeſſion of it, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no woman ever did but yourſelf, I will ſhew myſelf the paragon of good nature, and gratify the weakneſs I condemn, by telling you the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of our amiable nun.</p>
            <p>HOW unlucky now, for your poor dear curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity! Lady Ransford has this moment alighted.—I muſt fly to receive her, and bid you</p>

Poor abject wretch! Sir John has aſſured him that he never can feel reſentment for a perſon he deſpiſes; ſo that he may return to England in perfect ſafety.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My dear FANNY,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM heartily glad that the mock war, as you call it, between us, is at an end, as I ſhould at preſent, be totally unable to ſupport my ſhare in the combat, and of courſe, muſt fall before the conqueror. I have been unuſually diſpirited, and languid, for theſe two days.—I feel, as if I had cauſe to be melancholy, and yet endeavour to perſuade myſelf that I have none. This is a ſtate not to be deſcribed: and to you, who, I dare ſay, have never experienced it, may appear ridiculous; and yet, believe me, it is a painful ſituation—But I flatter myſelf, I have rather caught, than bred this malady.</p>
            <p>LORD Seymour left us this morning; and for ſome days before he ſet out, he ſeemed to have acquired an additional degree of melancholy ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Love he can never feel more.—Beſides, <hi>my</hi> lord ſeems infected with the ſame diſorder; looks grave, and ſighs. Tell me then, Fanny, is it poſſible that male friendſhip is ſo much more delicate and tender than ours, that their mutual ſadneſs could ariſe from a ſeparation, for a few weeks, or perhaps months. If this ſhould be the real cauſe, I ſhall bluſh for my own want of ſenſibility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0465000101:90"/>I SHOULD think lord Seymour in ſuch a ſtate of mind, that no ſlight or trivial misfortune could poſſibly affect him; for they who have once felt real anguiſh, may bid defiance to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ills. The arrows of adverſity may glance againſt, but cannot wound a heart already bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. From ſympathy alone, ſuch minds can ſuffer.—But, Oh! far, far, be the thought, from Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's fond boſom, that lord Woodville's ſufferings ſhould cauſe lord Seymour's ſorrow! It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible! I am ſorry I have expreſſed ſuch a thought, even to you, my ſiſter. I would blot it from the paper, if I could eraſe it from my mind.</p>
            <p>WE had, laſt night, a concert, in a temple dedicated to Apollo, in the garden.—My lord, whoſe voice is harmony itſelf, was ſinging one of Shenſtone's elegies. I accompanied him on the harpſichord, and lord Seymour on the violoncello.—At theſe words,
<q>
                  <l>" <hi>She was fair, and I could not but love,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>" <hi>She is faithleſs, and I am undone.</hi>"</l>
               </q>
I ſaw lord Seymour fix his eyes on lord Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's face, which, in a moment, became ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed with crimſon; his voice faltered ſo much, that he could ſcarce finiſh the ſong.</p>
            <p>THE moment it was ended, he quitted the temple. I felt myſelf alarmed; I feared he was taken ill, and went immediately towards the houſe. As I croſſed the parterre, I ſaw him walking briſkly, in a path that leads to the wood: this quieted my apprehenſions for his health, but left my mind in a ſtate incapable of thinking.—I retired to my chamber, and continued to muſe, till ſummoned to ſupper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0465000101:91"/>THERE was no notice taken of what had paſſed—we parted earlier than uſual, all but lord Seymour, and my lord, who continued together, till near four o'clock. I could not ſleep, and wiſhed to have riſen, and either walked, or read; but was unwilling to diſcover my reſtleſſneſs to him who cauſed it. When we met, at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, Mr. Ransford, who was juſt arrived from London, aſked my lord in a low voice, if I had been ill, as he obſerved that I looked much paler than uſual.</p>
            <p>WHAT a flutter am I in! Juſt as I had wrote the laſt word, my dear lord opened the door, and ſaid he came to requeſt the pleaſure of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to ſee a new improvement he is making; and, with the moſt engaging affability, added, that he feared he had diſturbed my reſt, by ſitting up ſo late, but thought an airing would do us both good.</p>
            <p>HIS behaviour has made all the foregoing part of my letter appear a viſion to me. Do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to it, my Fanny, till you hear from me again; and I hope, by next poſt, to have forgot I ever wrote it.</p>
            <p>ADIEU, adieu, that I may fly indeed, to the moſt amiable of men.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE cloud that hung over my mind, is totally diſperſed, and my happineſs reſtored with my reaſon. What a viſionary muſt you think me! but do not chide me, my loved ſiſter, leſt, by endeavouring at a juſtification, I ſhould fancy I had found reaſon to ſupport my folly.</p>
            <p>I NEVER ſpent ſo delightful a day, as the laſt on which I wrote to you. During our airing, which was about ſix miles, my lord appeared, if poſſible, more amiable to me than ever. There was a peculiar air of tenderneſs diffuſed through his voice and manner; perhaps the parting from his friend, had ſoftened his already gentle nature. Perhaps—but why pry into his boſom, in ſearch of a cauſe, which might render the effect leſs pleaſing?</p>
            <p>IN leſs than an hour, we arrived at the neateſt and moſt elegant cottage, I ever beheld. It was ſeated on the declivity of a hill, and defended from the North winds by a ſmall wood, ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully variegated, that even in this leafy ſeaſon, ſummer, autumn, and winter, ſeemed to vye in the luxuriancy of the different ſhades, which their ſeveral periods produce.</p>
            <p>BEFORE the houſe a pendant lawn, covered with ſheep and lambs, reached to the river, which winded in the moſt beautiful mazes round the hill. Over the broadeſt part of it, was a Gothic bridge of one arch, with a watch tower in the center; and on the other ſide of the houſe, ſtood a ſmall nurſery and ſhrubbery—I was never more
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0465000101:93"/>
agreeably ſurprized, than with this lovely ſcene. I really think if I was to meet with any ſevere affliction, that I ſhould like to retire to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſolitude, and paſs my days in it.</p>
            <p>I FREQUENTLY ſaw my lord's eyes ſparkle with pleaſure, at that which I expreſſed. As I neither ſaw or heard a human creature but our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I begged to know who were the happy owners of this lovely ſpot? ſaid I wiſhed to ſee and congratulate them, on their taſte and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.—He ſaid he would immediately comply with my requeſt, and by ſo doing, increaſe the happineſs of its poſſeſſors.</p>
            <p>HE then led me to the houſe, which was as ſimply elegant within, as without—I think I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw perfect neatneſs before—and preſented me to his nurſe an extreme good looking woman, about fifty—ſhe knew not in what manner to receive me—humility and joy ſeemed to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in her countenance—I ſtepped forward, and embraced her—my lord ſeemed delighted at what he was pleaſed to call my condeſcenſion.</p>
            <p>THE good woman has been a widow for twelve years; her huſband was firſt gardener to my lord's father and her ſon in-law is now in the ſame ſtation with us. Her daughter is a very pretty woman about two and twenty; and ready to lye in of a ſecond child. I never beheld ſuch a che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim as the firſt. My lord ſaid archly, he hoped his foſter ſiſter and I ſhould be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and that ſhe would undertake the ſame good office for me, that her mother had done for his.</p>
            <p>THE poor girl bluſhed, and curtſyed; I felt my cheeks glow: and walked to the window—I confeſs I was charmed with his intention to ſuch a point, which the fooliſh lords of the creation generally think below them. He then inquired
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0465000101:94"/>
for the nurſe's mother, and the fineſt old woman I ever ſaw, came into the room—I ſaluted her alſo—her hair was perfectly ſilver, and her ſkin like down—ſhe bleſſed and embraſſed my lord, while tears of joy and gratitude ran down her fair unfurrowed cheek.</p>
            <p>MY lord was affected, and ſaw me ſow; and in order to change the ſubject, told the good woman of the houſe, he was come to dine with her.—She looked amazed, and ſo ſhould I, had I then thought him ſerious—But I found he was ſo, when he told her ſhe could certaily give us good bread, butter, raſhers and eggs, and a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad; and that he would take care of the reſt.</p>
            <p>I SMILED aſſent; but ſaid we ſhould ſend home to prevent the company waiting. He ſaid there was no neceſſity for it, as he was quite ſatisfied that our friends at Woodfort would ſit down to dinner at the ſame inſtant that we did, without hearing from us. I then ſuppoſed he had left orders that they ſhould not wait, and was pleaſed with the idea of our ſimple ruſtic meal. But I was to be ſtill more ſurprized; for in about ten minutes the coach arrived with lady Harriet, Fany Weſton, Sir James Thornton, and Mr. Ransford. A ſumpter car followed with wine and cold proviſions.</p>
            <p>THE beauty of the ſcene, the fineneſs of the day, the unpremeditatedneſs of the ſcheme, all conſpired to render us more chearful, than we ſhould have been perhaps in any other place on earth; and we all returned home delighted with our little expedition, and full of gratitude to my lord, for the pleaſure it had afforded us.</p>
            <p>THIS is an enormous long letter, but you taught me to riſe early; I can therefore ſpare time to my abſent friends, as well as thoſe about me; and I can never think that time better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0465000101:95"/>

                              <hi>The</hi> HISTORY <hi>of Miſs</hi> CHARLOTTE BEAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONT.</head>
                           <p>AS the chief circumſtances which relate to this lady, refer more to others than herſelf, we muſt look back to the firſt cauſes of thoſe effects, which ſeem to have marked her fate. Unhappy in the very article of her birth, though deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a noble family, it will be neceſſary to give ſome account of the authors of her being.</p>
                           <p>HER father the preſent general Beaumont, was the youngeſt ſon of one of the moſt antient, and illuſtrious houſes in France: but as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the caſe with the ſuperfluous branches of great families of that nation, he was poſſeſſed of no other patrimony than his high birth, a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon, and his ſword.</p>
                           <p>THE church and the army are the only provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which ſeem to be deſigned for the cadets of the nobleſſe. To the latter our young ſoldier of fortune applied himſelf, and ſoon obtained a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel poſt there. In this ſituation the then du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs dowager of H— ſaw, and was captivated with our young hero.—Though her age more
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0465000101:96"/>
than doubled his, her perſon was ſtill pleaſing, and her fortune ſo infinitely ſuperior to his moſt ſanguine hopes, that he did not long heſitate to accept ſuch a ſplendid eſtabliſhment.</p>
                           <p>THEY paſſed ſome years together, with that polite indifference, which diſtinguiſhes the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried couples of high rank, in that gay nation. At length, the ducheſs began to grow weary, of treading the ſame dull circle, for ſo many years, and propoſed, to the general they ſhould viſit one of her eſtates in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and paſs a ſummer there. Though he was by no means tired of the <hi>grande monde,</hi> nor could poſſibly form any very delightful idea of retirement, with ſuch a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as her grace, he politely aſſented to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
                           <p>WHEN they had been ſome time in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the ducheſs hinted a deſire of ſending for a young lady, who was a diſtant relation of her firſt huſband's, and whom ſhe had formerly placed in a convent. This propoſal was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to the general. The moſt deſirable <hi>tetes a tetes,</hi> ſometimes grow languid: but the intervenſion of a third perſon in ſuch a ſituation as theirs, was moſt devoutly to be wiſhed for.</p>
                           <p>HER grace ſet out the next morning, for the convent de—, which was about five leagues from her ſeat, and returned in the evening, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the too lovely Charlotte D'Etree.—The general though well accuſtomed to the power of beauty, became ſuddenly captivated.—Never had he beheld ſuch a face and form before—ſuch ſimple elegance, ſuch unaffected grace, the beauties of Venus, with Dian's modeſty.</p>
                           <p>WHILE the lovely Charlotte felt at leaſt as much ſurprize at the ſight of him. We have already ſaid his perſon was remarkably graceful, his air at once engaging and commanding; nor
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0465000101:97"/>
was any outward ornament neglected, that could put off ſuch a form to the beſt advantage.—What an amazing effect muſt ſuch a figure have upon a girl not yet ſeventeen! who had been bred in a cloiſter, and had never ſeen, or at leaſt converſed, with any man who did not wear a <hi>cowl.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>THE ducheſs attempted to appologize for Charlotte's aſtoniſhment. By obſerving that the poor girl had been brought up in an abſolute ignorance; but hoped when ſhe had been ſome time with her, that her aukward amazement would wear off. She might have talked for ever without interruption. The general had neither ſpeech nor hearing; his faculties ſeemed all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed in one; and through his eyes alone, his heart was for the firſt time taught to feel a real paſſion.</p>
                           <p>THE little wanton God, too much the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's friend, ſoon inſpired the innocent and fair D'Etree, with the ſame ſentiments. Never did the tyrant reign more abſolute, than in the hearts of theſe his willing ſlaves. Whole months paſſing away in all the delights of mutual fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſeemed to the lovers but a day; and when at the end of autumn, the ducheſs talked of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Paris, it appeared to them like being doomed to baniſhment.</p>
                           <p>CHARLOTTE was to accompany the ducheſs thither; but the general knew their interviews muſt be leſs frequent, and more liable to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, than in the charming ſolitude of <hi>belle veue.</hi> After every excuſe was obviated, and every poſſible contrivance of delay exhauſted they were forced to ſubmit; and the once gay and lively Charles Beaumont, ſet out for the metropolis, with infinitely more regret than he had quitted it. The ducheſs was happily not of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0465000101:98"/>
a jealous nature; and the enamoured pair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with ſo much circumſpection, that ſhe never ſeemed to have the leaſt ſuſpicion of their mutual attachment to the laſt hour of her life.</p>
                           <p>THE natural conſequences of their guilty love, now began to make Charlotte taſte the bitter ingredients of that intoxicating cup, of which ſhe had drank ſo deeply. Infamy ſtared her in the face; and, though a criminal paſſion had triumphed over chaſtity, her modeſty was not yet extinguiſhed. Sleepleſs nights, and days of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, now became her portion. She deteſted herſelf and all the world; all, but the guilty au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of her miſery. How often did ſhe wiſh, ſhe never had quitted the cloiſter; but there, like the deſart roſe, have bloomed and died un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, in innocence and peace!</p>
                           <p>THE general, whoſe fondneſs if poſſible was encreaſed by her ſituation, ſaid every thing in his power to conſole her, by promiſing to ſecure her fame. Many were the expedients he thought of, but none of them ſeemed ſufficient to ſatisfy the delicate apprehenſions of the unhappy Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte. At length ſhe recollected that there was a young woman in the convent where ſhe had been bred, whoſe father and mother were dead, and had left her in ſuch low circumſtances that ſhe could neither afford to live in the world, or pay her penſion where ſhe remained; and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under the painful neceſſity of taking the veil, contrary to her inclinations, or of going into the world as a dependent.</p>
                           <p>THIS perſon then ſhe fixed upon as a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and immediately wrote to her to come to Paris, with ample promiſes of taking care of her future fortune. Mademoiſelle Laval was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at ſuch a ſummons, and inſtantly obeyed it. In the mean time, the general hired a very neat
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0465000101:99"/>
furniſhed houſe for her reception, and appointed ſervants and every thing proper for her arrival.—She was informed that ſhe was to perſonate a lady whoſe huſband was juſt dead, and who was come from a diſtant part of Normandy, to proſecute a law-ſuit and lye in at Paris.</p>
                           <p>THE unhappy ſituation of this young woman's circumſtances, made her readily acquieſce in every thing that Charlotte required; and ſhe entered her houſe, with all the melancholy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of an afflicted relict. In a few days after her arrival, the real mourner, the poor wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Charlotte, went to viſit her; and after ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a flood of tears upon her boſom, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with her unhappy ſituation and implored her aſſiſtance.</p>
                           <p>MADEMOISELLE Laval, naturally good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, and ſoftened by the unhappy condition of her friend, promiſed every thing ſhe could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;—endeavoured to ſoothe and comfort her affliction; and at laſt, ſettled matters in ſuch a way, that the moment Charlotte found herſelf taken ill, ſhe was to go there; that every neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary preparation ſhould he made and every ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care taken of her and her offspring.</p>
                           <p>EVERY thing happened to their utmoſt wiſhes: ſhe was taken ill as ſhe was dreſſing to go to a ball at the Engliſh ambaſſador's. The duches was luckily prevented from going by a ſlight cold; and Charlotte, when ſhe got into the carriage had no one to oppoſe her being ſet down where ſhe pleaſed.—She went directly to her friend's houſe, and was there happily deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a ſon and daughter, who were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptized, by the names of Charles and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte.</p>
                           <p>IN as ſhort a time as was poſſible after this event, the general and one of his particular
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0465000101:100"/>
friends carried Charlotte home in a ſedan chair. She ſaid ſhe had been taken ill at the ball, and went directly to bed, where ſhe continued for ſome days; and to carry on the deceit, Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle Laval confined herſelf to her bed and went through all the forms of a real <hi>accouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>THIS great event ſo well over, the general thought himſelf the happieſt man living.—He doated on his children, and perfectly adored their lovely mother.—But ſhe continued to appear gloomy, and dejected; and at laſt declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe ſhould never know peace, while the living witneſſes of her ſhame, continued in the ſame kingdom with her. She ſeldom ſaw them, and when ſhe did, expreſſed abhorrence, rather than tenderneſs, towards them. She behaved with the utmoſt coldneſs to the general, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to be infinitely more miſerable, than ſhe had ever been before.</p>
                           <p>THE general was almoſt diſtracted at her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and at length conſented to the removal of the children. It was agreed that Laval ſhould go over to England, take upon her the name of Beaumont, and educate them as her own, till the ducheſs died—as ſoon as that ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, he promiſed to marry Charlotte, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them as the orphans of a near relation.</p>
                           <p>IN the mean time he ſettled a very handſome income on Laval, and the little innocents ſet out for London, with their fictitious mother, who felt, however, infinitely more tenderneſs for them than their real one ſeemed to have done.</p>
                           <p>NOTHING remarkable happened, during their infancy. Mademoiſelle Laval, by the general's recommendation, became acquainted with any families of diſtinction, and though
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0465000101:101"/>
quite unacquainted with the word, behaved her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo properly, that ſhe was as much eſteemed, as known, and her lovely children univerſally admired.</p>
                           <p>WHEN they were about ſeven years old, the ducheſs died, and in as ſhort a ſpace as decency would admit of, the general fulfilled his promiſe, to his ſtill adored, and beautiful Charlotte. On this occaſion, Mademoiſelle Laval, who really doated on her amiable charge, felt the tendereſt concern at the thoughts of parting with it—but ſhe might have ſpared her ſorrow, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Beaumont was, by no means, inclined to rob her of it. On the contrary, when the general propoſed the children's return, ſhe grew outrageous, and declared ſhe would never ſee him more, if he attempted to bring them into any part of France. She was born to rule his fate, and he ſubmitted, though reluctantly, to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human, and unnatural commands.</p>
                           <p>IN about ten months after their marriage, ſhe brought him a ſon, which, in ſome meaſure, conſoled him for the loſs of his other children; and, in another year, preſented him with a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In a little time, his fondneſs was wholly transferred to the objects of her adoration.—Never was ſo fond a mother; and madame de Beaumont was looked upon as the pattern of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection, while ſhe not only abandoned, but deteſted her former offspring.</p>
                           <p>THE general's letters to Laval became leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; and though he punctually remitted her income, he ſeldom mentioned thoſe, for whoſe uſe it was deſigned. In vain poor Laval endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to awaken the tender feelings of a father in his heart, by boaſting the amazing beauty of his Charlotte, or mentioning the fine parts, and accompliſhments of his amiable Charles. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0465000101:102"/>
ſeemed dead in him, as much as in their cruel mother.</p>
                           <p>AT length, worn by the perpetual remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the humane and generou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> Laval, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a commiſſion for his ſon, who was then about ſixteen, in a regiment that was to embark from Dunkirk, for America; but ſent ſtrict or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that he ſhould not go to Paris, and conjured Laval to keep him ſtill ignorant of his birth.</p>
                           <p>POOR Charlotte almoſt died away, at the thoughts of being ſeparated from her brother. It was the firſt cauſe ſhe had ever known for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and nature ſeemed inclined to make them both amends for the loſs of parental affection, by beſtowing a double portion of fraternal love, on each.</p>
                           <p>OUR young ſoldier, whoſe ardor for glory was extreme, was all gratitude to his ſuppoſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſuffering him to follow the bent of his inclination; and, at the appointed time, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted London, with a heart filled at once with bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and tenderneſs.</p>
                           <p>IN order to divert the melancholy which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Charlotte for her brother's abſence, lady Sandford invited the feigned mademoiſelle de Beaumont, and her ſuppoſed daughter, to paſs ſome time at her ſeat in the country. The invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was readily accepted, and there Charlotte, now in her ſeventeenth year, firſt ſaw lord Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                           <p>HER beauty was then only in its dawn, but even then, like Aurora breaking through the clouds, it gave a promiſe of the brighteſt day. The tender regret ſhe felt for her brother's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, gave an additional ſoftneſs to her voice, and manners; and the expreſſive ſenſibility of her large hazel eyes, ſeemed encreaſed by her gentle diſtreſs.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0465000101:103"/>SUCH an amiable object could not fail of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring paſſion, in a heart leſs ſuſceptible than lord Seymour's, or indeed, any heart, that was not guarded by a prepoſſeſſion. He ſoon felt the moſt ardent, and ſincere affection for her, nor was he the only perſon who was ſenſible of the power of her charms The young duke of B— ſaw her at a ball at Northampton, and became inſtantly enamoured—He waited on lady Sandford in a few days after, and with all the precipitancy of youth, high rank, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, propoſed himſelf to mademoiſelle de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, for her daughter.</p>
                           <p>WHETHER Charlotte's delicacy was really hurt by ſuch a proceeding, or whether ſhe then felt a preference for lord Seymour, ſhe inſtantly rejected the duke's propoſal, with an air of <hi>fierte,</hi> unknown to her before. Mademoiſelle de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, who tenderly loved her, acquieſced in her determination, and reſolved not to acquaint her real parents, that ſuch a match had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                           <p>CHARLOTTE was tranſported at her feigned mother's kind condeſcenſion, and promiſed the moſt implicit obedience, which indeed ſhe had ever ſhewn to all her commands. She began now to recover her ſpirits was all chearfulneſs, and vivacity: and from this pleaſing tranſition, ſhe acquired, if poſſible new charms; and each, and every day, lord Seymour became more and more enamoured.</p>
                           <p>THE two happieſt months of Charlotte's life were now paſſed, and mademoiſelle de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont talked of returning to London. Before they ſet out, lord Seymour found an opportunity of diſcloſing his paſſion to Charlotte. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his declaration with that frankneſs, and candour, that ever dwell with generous minds;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0465000101:104"/>
but at the ſame time, told him, that ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered herſelf under ſuch obligations to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for her conduct towards her, in regard to the duke of B—, that ſhe would never liſten to any perſon's addreſſes, who had not the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her approbation.</p>
                           <p>THE enamoured Seymour, whoſe paſſion was as truly delicate, as the fair object that inſpired it, was now at the ſummit of felicity—he threw himſelf at Charlotte's feet, and poured forth his ſoul, in the warmeſt expreſſions of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, for her generous and unaffected behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and at the ſame time, obtained her leave to apply to mademoiſelle de Beaumont for her conſent, as ſoon as they ſhould return to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                           <p>HE was permitted the happineſs of attending them thither, and the day after their arrival wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on mademoiſelle de Beaumont, to intreat her leave to pay his addreſſes to her lovely daughter. True love is ever timid, and conſcious as lord Seymour was, that the advantage of birth and fortune were on his ſide, he felt perhaps more apprehenſions on this occaſion than a young enſign would at addreſſing a lady of the higheſt rank.</p>
                           <p>ALL that he knew of Chorlotte's circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or condition, was, that her mother paſſed for the widow of a general officer, that her fortune was ſmall, but ſufficient to ſupport her little family genteelly, with oeconomy; and that ſhe had maintained an unblemiſhed reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in London for near ſeventeen years.</p>
                           <p>BUT how were the generous and diſintereſted Seymour's fears increaſed, when mademoiſelle de Beaumont told him ſhe was highly ſenſible of the honour he intended her daughter, but that ſhe thought her yet too young to marry, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0465000101:105"/>
that ſhe had laid herſelf under an engagement, never to diſpoſe of Charlotte, without firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting her father's family and friends! ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him as a man of honour, not to mention his paſſion to Charlotte, as by inſpiring her with a mutual one, he might perhaps render them both miſerable.</p>
                           <p>LORD Seymour inſtantly told her it was out of his power to obey her injunction, as it was by Charlotte's permiſſion he had then the honour of intreating her conſent, and that he neither could nor would deſiſt from endeavouring to gain a heart, on which all his happineſs in this life depended. Mademoiſelle de Beaumont was moved, even to tears, at the unhappy ſituation of the lovers. She too plainly ſaw the obſtacles that muſt prevent their union, but generouſly promiſed and reſolved to do every thing in her power for their mutual happineſs.</p>
                           <p>LORD Seymour ventured to remonſtrate to her, that with regard to the duke of B—'s propoſal, ſhe had acted as ſole parent and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of her daughter, and he could not ſee the neceſſity of farther conſultation for accepting, than refuſing a lover. She owned her tenderneſs for Charlotte had in that caſe triumphed over her promiſe, but ſhe had even then, only aſſumed a negative power, which was more in right of her daughter, than herſelf, for ſhe never could think it juſt, that either parents or friends ſhould even perſuade a perſon to marry contrary to their own inclinations. She told him ſhe would write immediately to France, and repreſent his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's birth, fortune and perſon, in the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous light in which ſhe beheld them.</p>
                           <p>EXALTED as his ideas were of the object of his paſſion, he had great reaſon to flatter himſelf, that his alliance would not be contemned by any
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0465000101:106"/>
family in France; and when he conſidered that the exquiſite perfections of his charming Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte muſt he unknown to thoſe perſons, who were to be conſulted in the diſpoſal of them his fears would ſometimes vaniſh, and his fond heart beat, with all the tranſporting hopes of ſucceſsful love.</p>
                           <p>CHARLOTTE who had never heard made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Beaumont talk of her father's family till now, conſidered the difficulties that were ſtarted in another light, and fancied ſhe only meant them to protract the marriage, till ſhe ſhould be eighteen, which ſhe had often heard her ſay, was full early for a young lady to marry. However, without enquiring ſhe perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced in her ſuppoſed mother's conduct, and while ſhe had the happineſs of ſeeing and hearing the tendereſt of lovers and moſt charming of men, ſhe knew not a wiſh ungratified. Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Beaumont fulfilled her promiſe, by writing immediately to the general, and menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning lord Seymour in the juſteſt and of courſe moſt pleaſing light.</p>
                           <p>IT happened that the general and his lady were at that time at Aix la Chapelle, where he had been ſeized with a violent fever; and though the letter was forwarded to him, as the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſuperſcription were known by his lady, it lay for ſometime unopened.</p>
                           <p>DURING this interval the fictitious mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle de Beaumont was attacked by the ſmall-pox, which appeared of ſo malignant a ſort, that her fate was quickly pronounced by her phyſicians. As ſoon as ſhe was acquainted with her diſorder, ſhe forbad Charlotte to come near her, as ſhe had never had it; but in vain ſhe commanded, or lord Seymour entreated her to abſent herſelf a moment from her bed-ſide. She ſaid it was her
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0465000101:107"/>
firſt, and ſhould be her laſt act of diſobedience; and for that reaſon, ſhe hoped her dear and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parent would pardon it.</p>
                           <p>OVERCOME by her filial piety, they ſuffered her to undergo ſuch conſtant and violent fatigue, as at any other time, would have deſtroyed her delicate and beauteous frame. But ſhe ſupported it with ſuch a tender alacrity and attention, as amazed and affected every one who ſaw her: even lord Seymour's love was encreaſed by his admiration of her virtues, and roſe almoſt to adoration.</p>
                           <p>WHEN mademoiſelle de Beaumont was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of her danger, which was but a few hours before her death, ſhe deſired to be left alone with Charlotte—After embracing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring bleſſings on her, ſhe told her that neither her time nor ſtrength, would permit her reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſecret that was of the utmoſt conſequence to her. But as ſhe had ever endeavoured to be prepared for the tremendous event that was now come to paſs, ſhe had kept a journal of her life, from the time ſhe quitted the convent de—, to the moment of her illneſs; that in thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſhe would find her own hiſtory included, and that of <hi>her real parents.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>CHARLOTTE, though drowned in tears, was all attention, till thoſe aſtoniſhing words, <hi>her real parents!</hi> ſmote her ear.—She then cried out, ah, madam! will you not only abandon, but deny me? Alas! what has your Charlotte done! Be comforted, my more than daughter, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; I was not worthy of ſuch a bleſſing.—Yet ſtill, I hope, more worthy than they who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs ſo rich a treaſure, regardleſs of its value. But if their hearts, ſo long hardened to your blooming virtues, at length relent, and give you to the worthy Seymour, you will have no cauſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0465000101:108"/>
to regret their paſt neglect, or court their future protection. May you be happy! This key (tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one from her boſom) will explain what I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. And now adieu, for ever!</p>
                           <p>THE ſudden effects of ſurpriſe joined to thoſe of grief, quite overcame the afflicted Charlotte.—She fainted, and was conveyed ſenſeleſs to her own apartment. Madmoiſelle de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont continued to breathe, till ſhe heard Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte was reſtored to life; then yielded up her own.</p>
                           <p>THE next day Charlotte was ſeized with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions; and immediately after the ſmall-pox appeared, but of a ſafe and gentle kind—the malignity of the diſorder had ſpent its force upon mademoiſelle de Beaumont; and the low ſtate both of Charlottes mind and body, rendered its operations leſs powerful. Lord Seymour never quitted her apartment, though not permitted to enter her chamber; nor could he be prevailed on, even to reſt himſelf on a couch, till the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians pronounced her out of danger.</p>
                           <p>AS ſoon as it was poſſible ſhe ſaw him: he appeared more altered than herſelf. Never was ſuch an interview between two lovers. Their preſent loſs of beauty ſeemed to augment their fondneſs; and each felt more real tenderneſs for the other, than at any former inſtant of their lives, Lord Seymour, though he lamented the death of mademoiſelle de Beaumont, very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, now thought that every bar to his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs was removed; and as Charlotte appeared to be the miſtreſs of her own fate, he had no apprehenſions that his could be unhappy.</p>
                           <p>SHE had laughed at madame de Beaumont's ſuperſtitious attachment to diſtant relations, whom ſhe had not ſeen for many years, he therefore could not ſuſpect her being inefcted with the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0465000101:109"/>
ſame caprice. The mother ſaid, ſhe was bound by ſolemn engagements to the family of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont; the daughter could have entered into none, as ſhe left Paris when an infant. He had therefore, no reaſon to imagine that any power on earth could oppoſe his felicity; and indulged his fond imagination with reſpective views of fancied bliſs, which he was fated never to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy!</p>
                           <p>THE ſmall-pox had been ſo favourable to Charlotte, that ſhe had not been affected with the leaſt mark or alteration of feature; and the natural whiteneſs of her ſnowy ſkin, ſoon tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over the tranſitory redneſs, which is the common effect of that always diſagreeable, and ſometimes fatal diſorder.</p>
                           <p>BUT though her beauty had returned, her chearfulneſs ſeemed buried in mademoiſelle de Beaumont's tomb. Her affliction for her as a parent, would perhaps have ſubſided into a calm and gentle melancholy; but her laſt words had raiſed a tumult in her boſom, which ſhe had not reſolution ſufficient to conquer. She frequently endeavoured to perſuade herſelf, that her dear mother had raved in her laſt moments; but the ſtrength of her expreſſion, and calmneſs of her manner, oppoſed that fond belief.</p>
                           <p>AFTER her recovery, whole weeks elapſed without her having courage to open the cabinet, where the myſtery of her fate lay concealed. She feared to meet with new obſtacles to that happineſs, which ſhe had promiſed herſelf, by being united to lord Seymour.</p>
                           <p>HIS delicacy had yet prevented him from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his ardent wiſhes for their union, as the cauſe of her amiable diſtreſs was yet too recent; and many months might poſſibly have paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, in the ſame irreſolution, if the receipt of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0465000101:110"/>

                                 <p>NEVE was amazement equal to mine, at peruſing your laſt letter! What, you wretch as you are, raiſed by my hand, and ſupported by my bounty, preſume to dictate to me in the diſpoſal of my child! And who is this lord Seymour? he is not an heretic? if ſo that is ſufficient objection, were he a prince.</p>
                                 <p>BUT ſurely, madam, ſince you take upon you to inform us of intended marriages, and act as plenipotentiary, between our daughter, and ourſelves, you ſhould have informed us of the duke of B—'s propoſal and no more have dared to refuſe, than accept, a lover, for Charlotte Beaumont.</p>
                                 <p>THE young duke, himſelf, has informed me of his ſimple attachment to the ſilly girl, and of the inſolence with which his propoſal was rejected. He inquired, whether ſhe was of our family? I did as I ever ſhall, diſclaim her.</p>
                                 <p>THE general, who has been ill of a fever, by me commands you on receipt of this, to ſet out with Charlotte Beaumont, inſtantly for Paris. He has devoted her to heaven, and found out a fit retreat for that purpoſe, in the convent of St. Anthony. Be it your buſineſs as it is your duty, to teach her an implicit obedience, to his will.</p>
                                 <p>SHE is now of age, to be truſted with the ſecret of her birth; but let her alſo know,

                                    <p>THE moment you arrive at the hotel An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloiſe, you are commanded to ſend to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; but on no account attempt to come near our houſe.</p>

                           <p>THE ſituation of the unhappy Charlotte's mind, upon reading this letter, is not to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed. Who is this cruel woman, ſhe exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thus diſclaims an unoffending child? Oh! I will throw myſelf beneath her feet, and ſoften that obdurate heart with tears. My father too; I have a father then! Sure he will raiſe me up in his parental arms, and bleſs me! They will relent; and when they ſee my Seymour, and know his wondrous worth, his wondrous love, they will be charmed, as their fond daughter is and give me to his wiſhes.</p>
                           <p>FULL of theſe warm, and natural apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the half-diſtracted Charlotte flew to the cabinet, which like Pandora's box, contained a thouſand ills, and with a trembling hand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked it. The firſt objects that preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to her view, were miniature portraits of her father and mother.—She gazed with joy and wonder. Never had ſhe beheld ſuch ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beauty, of both kinds; the manly and the mild.</p>
                           <p>SHE kiſſed, embraced, wept over them; nay, knelt to them, implored their pity and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and, in one moment, was inſpired with more reſpect and tenderneſs for thoſe inanimate
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0465000101:112"/>
figures, than ſhe had ever felt for her ſuppoſed mother; though gratitude and eſteeem had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all her purpoſes of filial affection in her gentle nature.</p>
                           <p>SHE now ſat down to ſearch the book of fate, thoſe fatal Sybils leaves that told her doom; and while ſhe read, felt every paſſion that the human heart is capable of.—Yet ſtill her love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for her parents remained predominant; and ſhe determined to ſacrifice herſelf to their unnatural commands and paſs her days in a cloiſter, if ſhe could not prevail on them to change their cruel purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>SHE quickly ſaw how improper it would have been to acquaint lord Seymour with her real ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as he would, doubtleſs, oppoſe her return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to France, with all the eloquence of love.—Yet to quit him without making any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, or to deſcend to invent a falſe one, were equally repugnant to her tender and generous nature.</p>
                           <p>SHE had been bred in the Roman Catholic faith, but had never converſed with bigots, nor once thought that marrying the man ſhe loved could be deemed a crime againſt any religion. The idea firſt ſhocked her, on her mother's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing him a heretic; and ſhe reſolved to make the difference of opinions a pretext for poſtponing their marriage, till ſhe could prevail upon her parents to give their conſent; which ſhe vainly hoped ſhe ſhould be able to obtain, from their tenderneſs, and his uncommon me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                           <p>THEY know the power of love, ſaid ſhe, and will not, like vulgar, and unfeeling minds, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to oppoſe his uncontroulable decrees.—They will regard lord Seymour, for their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte's ſake; and his tenderneſs for me ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0465000101:113"/>
by that love and duty that he ſhews to them.</p>
                           <p>THUS did the unhappy viſionary fair one amuſe herſelf, till lord Seymour came to pay his daily viſit. He had been uſed for ſome time paſt, to ſee her melancholy, and, at times, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed; but as ſoon as he then ſaw her, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that her whole frame had been uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly agitated. And when he tenderly intreated to know the cauſe, ſhe anſwered only with a flood of tears; and begged he would not preſs her on the ſubject.</p>
                           <p>THOUGH his fond heart was alarmed by a thouſand different fears, he choſe rather to bear that cruel ſtate of ſuſpenſe, than diſtreſs the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he adored; and immediately deſiſted from any further inquiries. When he left her that evening, he felt an unuſual degree of anxiety, and was ſeveral times tempted to return, and beg to know the ſource of her diſtreſs; but he feared to offend, by diſobeying her commands; and hoped, at their next meeting, her chagrin might be diſpelled.</p>
                           <p>LORD Seymour was to go out of town for a few days, to the nuptials of a near relation; and his loved Charlotte had bid him adieu, with a more than uſual tenderneſs. Charlotte reſolved to lay hold on the opportunity of lord Seymour's abſence, to ſet out for France. She had found in the late madame de Beaumont's cabinet about two hundred pounds, in bills and money; out of this ſum ſhe diſcharged all her ſervants except her own maid, whom ſhe determined to take with her. She ordered one of thoſe ſhe parted with, to remain in the houſe, till lord Seymour's return, in order to deliver him a letter, which ſhe ſhould leave for him.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0465000101:114"/>SHE had now, ſhe thought, ſettled matters in ſuch a way, that nothing remained to obſtruct her purpoſed journey.—But, alas! the more difficult part of her arduous taſk, was yet to come—She was now to bid adieu to the man her ſoul adored. She knew not what paſſion was, till the ſeverity of her fate compelled her to wiſh to conquer it. A thouſand times ſhe attempted to write to him, who was now dearer than ever to her, but could not find words that were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of expreſſing her complicated feelings.—Two ſleepleſs nights, and miſerable days thus paſſed. She dreaded lord Seymour's return; and on the third, while the chaiſe waited to carry her off, ſhe wrote the following lines.</p>
                           <floatingText type="letter">
                              <body>

                                 <p>WITH a heart and eyes overflowing with the ſincereſt tenderneſs, at the ſad thought of being ſeparated from the only man I ever did, or ever ſhall love, I find myſelf incapable of taking even a tranſient leave of him. Oh! may it prove ſo!</p>
                                 <p>My flight muſt appear extraordinary to you. Why am I not at liberty to explain my motives? But be aſſured, they are ſuch as your honour and virtue would approve, though your fondneſs might oppoſe the effect. I fly then, my dear lord Seymour, to render my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthy of you; to eaſe my heart of ſome ſcruples which, only, can prevent its being wholly yours.</p>
                                 <p>IF heaven ſmiles upon my purpoſe, you ſhall hear quickly from me; and ſurely inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and love, ſo pure as mine, may claim its care. But ſhould it, for wiſe purpoſes, unknown to me, blaſt all my flattering hopes

                                 <p>I WOULD ſay more, but cannot; the chaiſe waits to carry me—from whom! from thee! What agonies are in that thought! Nought but the hope of meeting ſoon again, could now enable me to ſay,</p>

                           <p>As ſoon as ſhe had ſealed her letter, ſhe flung herſelf into the chaiſe, and purſued her journey; which ſhe performed without meeting with any uncommon accident.</p>
                           <p>IN a few hours after ſhe ſet out, her brother, who had been near two years abſent, returned to London. His bravery had raiſed him to the rank of captain; and, as the war was then over, he had obtained leave to viſit his friends in England.</p>
                           <p>HE had not heard of mademoiſelle de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont's death, till he came to her houſe, and was at once informed of that and Charlotte's abrupt departure. The amiable young man was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſhocked and grieved; and in the midſt of his tears for mademoiſelle de Beaumont, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the uncertainty of his loved ſiſter's fate; and determined, as ſoon as it was poſſible, to purſue her ſteps to Paris.</p>
                           <p>JUST as he was quitting the houſe, his eyes ſwoln with tears, and his aſpect impreſſed with the deepeſt ſorrow, lord Seymour came to the door.—Young Beaumont iſſued out, regardleſs of a man he had never ſeen before; and lord Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0465000101:116"/>
though at firſt ſurprized at his appearance, upon receiving Charlotte's letter, thought of him no more.</p>
                           <p>INDEED all traces of recollection ſeemed to have been inſtantly eraſed from his memory, and he remained like a man ſuddenly transfixed by lightning. It was ſome time before he had power to aſk when ſhe ſet out? or whither ſhe was gone? And when the ſervant replied to his queries, he continued to repeat them, without receiving the information he ſo earneſtly deſired.</p>
                           <p>HE read her letter a thouſand times, yet would neither credit that nor the ſervant's affirmation, that ſhe had left the houſe.—He ran diſtractedly through every room, calling on his dear Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte's name; and crying out, It is impoſſible! ſhe muſt be here! O do not kill me for thy ſport, my love! But when he found his ſearch was in vain, he retired to his houſe, in a ſtate very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhort of diſtraction.</p>
                           <p>THE moment our fair fugitive landed at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais, ſhe wrote a letter to each of her parents, filled with expreſſions of the humbleſt duty, and tendereſt affection. She acquainted them with the death of her ſuppoſed mother, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned her obligations to her with the higheſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and eſteem. She implored their permiſſion to throw herſelf at their feet, and that they would allow her a happineſs ſhe had been ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of, that of receiving a parent's bleſſing.</p>
                           <p>IN vain, was her tender and virtuous mind, enriched with every noble and generous ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that could do honour to humanity; her cruel parents were literally in the ſtate of the <hi>deaf adder</hi>: they ſhut their ears and eyes to her perfections; and refuſed to receive the higheſt

pleaſure that human nature is capable of, that of beholding an amiable and accompliſhed child.</p>
                           <p>AS ſoon as ſhe arrived at the hotel Angloiſe, ſhe found a ſervant waiting with a letter for her, which contained theſe words.</p>

                           <p>UPON reading this letter, all the tender ideas of filial affection, which had thronged about poor Charlotte's heart, ſeemed to vaniſh, and the poignant anguiſh ſhe had felt, at tearing herſelf from her fond and generous lover, returned with double force.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0465000101:118"/>SHE, however, determined not to halt at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the race; and turning to her conductor, with the utmoſt mildneſs and reſignation, ſaid ſhe was ready to attend him; and hoped when ſhe was lodged for the night, he would do her the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to wait till ſhe ſhould write a few lines to madame de Beaumont.</p>
                           <p>HE told her he was ordered not to bring back any letter or meſſage, and hoped ſhe would not take his refuſal ill, as he durſt not venture to diſobey—The tears now forced their way into Charlotte's eyes. She told the ſervant ſhe would not be the cauſe of his diſobedience on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and that ſhe was ready to follow him.</p>
                           <p>HE put her and her maid into a chariot, and directed the coachman where he was to go. When they alighted, they were ſhewn into a very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant apartment; and her conductor, after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring whether ſhe wanted money, or any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſtance from him, being anſwered in the negative, bowed and withdrew.</p>
                           <p>AS ſoon as he was gone, the now miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Charlotte gave vent to all her ſorrows; ſhe threw herſelf upon the ground, and waſhed it with her tears. Her affectionate ſervant, who had lived with her from her infancy, without knowing the cauſe of her diſtreſs, vainly endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole her; intreated her to return to England; and talked of lord Seymour's love and conſtancy.</p>
                           <p>HER every word ſtruck daggers to the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Charlotte's heart—As ſoon as ſhe was able to ſpeak, ſhe told her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> ſhe muſt part with her the next day; that ſhe determined to go into a convent for ſome time; and adviſed her to ſet out immediately for London. The poor girl, who truly loved her, was almoſt diſtracted, at ſeeing and hearing her miſtreſs look and ſpeak ſo: and poſitively declared ſhe would never leave

her, let her determination in life be what it would.</p>
                           <p>CHARLOTTE peremptorily inſiſted on diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging her from her ſervice; but told her ſhe would ſupport her in Paris, while her money laſted, and that ſhe might ſometimes ſee her at the convent. This, in ſome meaſure, quieted the poor ſervant's anxiety; but Charlotte's unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs increaſed every hour.—She went not to bed, and the pearly drops remained on her fair cheek, when the ſun had exhaled thoſe of the dew.</p>
                           <p>SHE wrote a few lines to let lord Seymour know that ſhe was going into the convent of St. Anthony; and, in her diſtraction, gave the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to her made to deliver, without reflecting that the faithful Nannette had reſolved not to quit Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, till her miſtreſs's fate was determined.</p>
                           <p>IN the morning ſhe dreſſed herſelf, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to aſſume an air of compoſure and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, with a breaking heart.

                           <p>SHE took a moſt affectionate leave of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate maid, who followed the coach at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſaw her enter thoſe gates through which ſhe was never to paſs again.</p>
                           <p>WHEN they arrived at the convent, madame de Beaumont's woman preſented Charlotte to the abbeſs, as a willing victim. She was, therefore, received with every outward mark of eſteem; and the groſſeſt flattery was laviſhed by the whole ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terhood, on thoſe charms, which they vainly imagined an acceptable ſacrifice to the great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0465000101:121"/>DELUDED mortals!—the heart alone is all that he requires! nor do the tender charities of life, the love of parents, huſband, brethren, children, pollute the oblation, but render it more pleaſing in his ſight, who firſt ordained, then ſanctified theſe natural ties.</p>
                           <p>CHARLOTTE ſhewed not the leaſt reluctance at entering on her prohibition.—She knew that a year muſt elapſe, before ſhe could be compelled to take the veil; and ſtill flattered herſelf that fate would diſpoſe of her in another way, before that time ſhould expire. She imagined, that by a ſeeming acquieſcence, ſhe might be able to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, if not entirely remove, any reſtraint they might otherwiſe have been impoſed upon her.</p>
                           <p>SHE made no doubt, that lord Seymour's paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would prompt him to purſue her; and ſhe fully determined to acquaint him with every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of her life, if ſhe ſhould ever have an opportunity. For this purpoſe, ſhe employed every leiſure moment ſhe was miſtreſs of, in framing a little hiſtory, from the papers ſhe had found in the cabinet, with the additional circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that had happened from the time of her leaving London.</p>
                           <p>AS ſhe ſcarce ever appeared in the parlour, or at the grate, the ſiſterhood beheld her as the paragon of ſanctity; and her edifying example was quoted as a pattern for all the young ladies in the convent. The little taſk ſhe had impoſed on herſelf, by amuſing her mind, kept up her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſo that ſhe ſeemed to have acquired a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant habit of chearfulneſs.</p>
                           <p>BUT when her work was finiſhed, and two monts had elapſed, without hearing from her father, mother, or what was ſtill more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting, her lover, ſhe fell into a lowneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which terminated in a ſlow fever. She now
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0465000101:122"/>
looked upon herſelf as abandoned by all the world; and the cruel ſuſpicion of lord Seymour's inconſtancy, perfectly reconciled her to the gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my proſpect of perpetual ſecluſion.</p>
                           <p>HER faithful ſervant continued to ſee her fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and as often mingled her tears with thoſe of her unhappy miſtreſs. As ſhe was one day muſing on the uncommon miſeries of her fate, her maid approached her with unuſual chearfulneſs, and cried out, O, Madam! he is come.</p>
                           <p>A TRANSITORY joy now ſparkled in Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte's eyes and the ſoft bloom that had forſaken her cheek, returned with added bluſhes. Where is he? ſhe replied; and ah! how could he ſtay ſo long! Didſt thou ſee him, Nannette, and has he mourned my abſence?</p>
                           <p>AT that inſtant, one of the lay ſiſters came to inform Charlotte, that a gentleman deſired to ſee her. She flew to the grate, but how was her ſurprize encreaſed when inſtead of lord Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſhe beheld her brother?</p>
                           <p>IF any thing could have abated her joy at ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, it muſt have been the diſappointment ſhe felt, at not meeting lord Seymour. But though her expectation had been highly raiſed with the pleaſing hope of ſuch an interview, ſhe was ſincerely rejoice at the unexpected ſight of her much beloved brother.</p>
                           <p>HE immediately began to expoſtulate with her, on quitting England; and earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to leave the convent, and put herſelf under his protection. She told him that was not at preſent in her power, as ſhe was then in her noviciate, but promiſed not to take the veil, without his approbation, which ſhe was certain would follow every action of her life, when he was acquainted with the motives; and, in order
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0465000101:123"/>
to explain both her ſituation and his own, ſhe would ſend him ſome papers to peruſe which were of the utmoſt conſequence to them both.</p>
                           <p>CAPTAIN Beaumont was aſtoniſhed at the myſterious manner which accompanied his ſiſter's words; but as he had the higheſt opinion of her honour and underſtanding, he, for the preſent, ſuppreſſed his curioſity about the ſecrets ſhe hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, and retired to his lodgings, to wait till Nannette ſhould bring an explanation of the myſtery, in which he found his innocent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſiſter involved.</p>
                           <p>CAPTAIN Beaumont had left London, the day after his ſiſter, and eaſily traced her through the progreſs of her journey; but when he arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Paris, as he had no clue to guide him, he wandered near three months in purſuit of her, and but for the accidental meeting of Nannette in the ſtreet, he might have ſpent as many years in the ſame fruitleſs inquiry.</p>
                           <p>LORD Seymour, whoſe ardour and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to recover his loſt fair one, was ever more ſanguine than a brother's could be, was not ſo early in his purſuit. The agitation of his mind, upon receiving Charlotte's letter, had thrown him into a violent fever, and it was above three weeks before he was able to follow his fair fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                           <p>WHEN he came to Paris, he was much at a loſs to direct his inquiries as her brother had been—he had heard of her along the road, and alſo of captain Beaumont's following her; and from the deſcription he received of him, had no doubt of his being the ſame perſon he had ſeen at her houſe, the day ſhe left it.</p>
                           <p>LOVE and jealouſy are twins, and it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to defend the heart from one, if you admit the other. It was apparent to him that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0465000101:124"/>
and Charlotte were connected; and his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver having ſeen or heard of him, increaſed his apprehenſions of his being a favourite lover. Yet why, if that were the caſe, ſhould Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte continue to deceive him? why write ſuch a tender and affectionate adieu? he knew not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were to lull his fears to ſleep, and prevent his endangering her lover's ſafety. Thus did the unhappy Seymour increaſe his own calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and drag about a wretched lifeleſs form, to every public place in Paris, in the fond hope of meeting thoſe tranſcendant charms that were now buried in a cloiſter.</p>
                           <p>THE ſight of her brother had raiſed poor Charlotte's ſpirits, by reviving her hopes of getting out of the convent. Yet of what uſe would ſhe exclaim, is liberty, without love? Seymour abandons me, and the world itſelf is now become a ſolitude to me more gloomy even than this cell. But grant his love and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy ſhould ſtill ſubſiſt, and that he is this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as wretched as myſelf, could he receive into his family the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>rejected</hi> daughter of ſuch cruel parents! no, there is no reſource for me on earth; theſe walls for ever muſt confine this hapleſs frame; my heart alone is free, and flies of courſe to him!</p>
                           <p>AS ſoon as ſhe had leiſure ſhe incloſed made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Beaumont's papers, her father and mother's pictures, with a letter from herſelf to her brother, acquainting him with every thing that had paſſed, ſince her arrival in France, and intreating him not to mention the affinity bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween them at the convent, leſt it ſhould give offence to their parents, and occaſion their being reſtrained from ſeeing each other for the future. She earneſtly implored his protection and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, toward releaſing her from the ſtate ſhe was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0465000101:125"/>
in, and promiſed to be guided by him, in every action of her life.</p>
                           <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the inhuman treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Charlotte had met with on peruſing the papers, captain Beaumont was tranſported at finding himſelf ſo nearly related to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral—the pride of blood is inherent; and the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine hope of preferment, from ſuch a high deſcent, dazzled his reaſon. He flew directly to his ſiſter, and told her with the precipitancy natural to a young man, that he was rejoiced at the diſcovery, and would go and throw himſelf at his father's feet, without having the leaſt doubt of a favourable reception.</p>
                           <p>IN vain Charlotte remonſtrated againſt ſuch an unadviſed proceeding, and mentioned to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of her own conduct, and the ſeverity of her parents, notwithſtanding; in order to deter him from making the experiment. She feared that his approaching the general without any introduction, would be conſtrued into want of reſpect, and that ſhe ſhould be condemned for informing him that he had a right to do ſo—but he was not to be reſtraned.</p>
                           <p>SHE paſſed the night under the moſt gloomy apprehenſion, yet would often ſay to herſelf, what have I to fear? can I be made more wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? let me then receive the only conſolation that remains for miſery like mine, the knowing that any change muſt be for the better. Hapleſs maid! a change will come, that ſhall render your preſent ſtate by ſad compariſon, a ſcene of ſoft tranquility and eaſe.</p>
                           <p>THE next evening, on being informed that captain Beaumont was in the parlour, ſhe flew to receive him; and after aſking a thouſand queſtions with her eyes and tongue, ſhe laid her cheek cloſe to the grate to liſten to his anſwers.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0465000101:126"/>
At that inſtant ſhe beheld lord Seymour entering the room. The agitation of her mind, was now encreaſed almoſt to diſtraction: ſhe knew not what ſhe ſaid or did; and was utterly incapable of expreſſing the joy ſhe felt at ſeeing the dear idol of her ſoul. Her brother appeared dejected and unhappy; and the miſtaken Seymour attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted her confuſion and his melancholy, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which their ſouls were ſtrangers to.</p>
                           <p>WE have already hinted that jealouſy had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected his noble nature; but ſeeing the object of it, with the woman he adored, added a thouſand ſtings; and he now felt, in the ſupremeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, its poignant anguiſh. His behaviour to Charlotte was conſtrained and cold. He told her he was indebted to that gentleman, pointing to her brother, for the happineſs of ſeeing her: as he could not eaſily forget his having met him at her houſe, the morning ſhe left London, he naturally ſuppoſed he could inform him where ſhe was; and having accidentally ſeen him juſt then enter the convent, he had taken the liberty to inquire for her, and hoped ſhe would pardon his intruſion. He added, that he ſhould leave Paris in a few days, and deſired to know if ſhe had any commands to England.</p>
                           <p>THOUGH Charlotte was aſtoniſhed at his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, ſhe had however penetration enough to diſcover the cauſe, and ſaid ſhe hoped ſhe ſhould be able to prevail on him to prolong his ſtay, as ſhe flattered herſelf with the thoughts of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to England in a few months, and ſhould wiſh to have him her conductor.</p>
                           <p>HE bowed, and replied he ſhould think himſelf happy to be of any ſervice to her, provided he did not interfere with another perſons right; but as he believed that gentleman was her chief mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for viſiting France, he was doubtleſs entitled
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0465000101:127"/>
to the, honour of attending her to England, or wherever elſe ſhe pleaſed.</p>
                           <p>CHARLOTTE was rendered miſerable, by lord Seymour's ſuſpicions; yet as there was other company in the parlour, ſhe knew not how to obviate them, as ſhe was yet ignorant, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe might dare to own captain Beaumont for her brother. The latter was much ſurprized at lord Seymour's manner.—He knew not of any connection between Charlotte and him, and thought her too condeſcending.</p>
                           <p>THE reſt of the time they ſtaid, was paſſed in a conſtrained and difficult ſituation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Charlotte found, and ſeized an opportunity of ſpeaking the words that are quoted in her letter to lord Seymour, already related, before the gentleman withdrew.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'MY deareſt Henry, let not appearances diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb your mind; I can, and I will, account for every action of my life to you.—Let your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant attend at the grate to-morrow, for a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from me, and you ſhall be fully ſatisfied.'</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>THOUGH Charlotte's mind was perplexed with a thouſand doubts and fears, both for her brother and herſelf, the tranſport of having ſeen lord Seymour, triumphed over them all; and ſhe once again enjoyed a tranſient gleam of happineſs. She knew it was in her power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all his ſuſpicions: ſhe neither doubted his love nor honour; and was certain he would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt her in getting out of the convent, ſhould they attempt to compel her to take the veil.</p>
                           <p>AFTER writing a few lines to lord Seymour, and making up her pacquet for him, ſhe lay down to reſt, with a heart more at eaſe, than ſhe had ever felt, ſince the death of mademoiſelle

                           <p>NOTHING, but the immediate loſs of her ſenſes, could have preſerved her life.—She ſunk motionleſs upon the ground; and nature by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing totally over-powered, afforded ſome little reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite to her diſtracted mind. She remained in this ſituation, till the nuns, alarmed at her abſence from the chapel, came to ſeek her in her cell. But when their cruel care had brought her ſo far back, as to ſhew ſome ſigns of life, ſhe could neither ſpeak, nor weep. She appeared like grief perſonified. She neither beat her boſom, rent her hair, or committed any act of outrage, but continued almoſt immoveable, till a letter was brought her from madame de Beaumont, which contained theſe words:</p>

                           <p>WE might ſuppoſe that when the unhappy Charlotte had read her brother's note, her miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries could ſcarce admit addition; but her inhuman mother's letter convinced her that the cup of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, though ſeemingly brim-full, is always capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of increaſe.</p>
                           <p>SHE was ſeized with inexpreſſible terrors at the thoughts of being ſent to <hi>La Salpetriere.</hi> She was ſenſible the abbeſs and nuns where ſhe then was, treated her with the utmoſt kindneſs: for as they looked upon her as a voluntary victim, ſhe had never experienced the leaſt reſtraint, but what the common rules of the houſe preſcribed. She had been accuſtomed to the tendereſt treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all her life; and her preſent melancholy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation demanded it more than ever.</p>
                           <p>AFTER peruſing the cruel anathema, that doomed her to ſtill greater miſeries, ſhe flew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the abbeſs's apartment, and proſtrating herſelf before her, with a flood of tears implored her pity, and protection. The good woman was moved at her diſtreſs; and raiſing her from the ground, aſſured her that no authority except the expreſs order of the king, ſhould force her from that houſe; and that if her enemies ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to procure a mandate, by any falſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0465000101:130"/>
ſhe would exert her utmoſt abilities to protect her.</p>
                           <p>CHARLOTTE now conſidered the abſolute impoſſibility of any future connection with lord Seymour, and therefore looked upon her conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in the convent of <hi>St. Anthony,</hi> as an aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum moſt devoutly to he wiſhed for. She thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the abbeſs on her knees; and would at that inſtant have taken the veil, without repining, if they could have abridged the time of her proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>SHE had now no longer any terms to keep with madame de Beaumont; and therefore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the misfortunes her brother had met with, and entreated the abbeſs's permiſſion, to ſend hourly to inquire his health. Her requeſt was granted; and ſhe retired to her cell in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree leſs wretched than ſhe had left it.</p>
                           <p>BUT when her tortured imagination repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſtill dear lord Seymour, as the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of her brother, her grief was without bounds. Yes, ſhe would ſay, I am, indeed, accurſed! well does my mother ſtile me ſo.—Yet are they cruel words, to paſs maternal lips! Oh! had ſhe but once bleſſed me, I could not be the wretch I am.</p>
                           <p>IT is impoſſible to deſcribe the various emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her diſtracted mind; yet ſtill love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained triumphant; and ſhe ſtrove in vain, to purſue what ſhe thought the dictates of her duty, the hating of lord Seymour.</p>

                           <p>THERE wanted but this laſt ſtroke, to render Charlotte the verieſt wretch on earth. She had flattered herſelf, that lord Seymour had quitted <hi>France,</hi> immediately after the duel, and that his life at leaſt was ſafe; and that, at ſome time or other, ſhe ſhould be able to convince him of his error, and her innocence. But now ſhe beheld him wilfully devoting himſelf to the rack, and ſuffering torture, greater than even that can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict from his miſtaken opinion of her incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</p>
                           <p>IT was impoſſible that her delicate frame could longer ſupport the complicated agonies that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed

her mind. She fell into a raging fever: during her delirium, ſhe raved inceſſantly of racks, and gibbets, of ſnatching Seymour from them, and ſuffering in his place. At length, however, the natural goodneſs of her conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and her blooming youth ſurmounted this dreadful diſorder, and her reaſon and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs returned together.</p>
                           <p>THE firſt gleam of peace that broke through the horrors of her fate, were ſome ſmall hopes of her brother's recovery; and in conſequence of thoſe hopes, ſhe by a ſolemn vow devoted herſelf to heaven, if it ſhould be pleaſed to ſpare his life.

                           <p>HE then gave her an account of the interview he had with his father, and of the diſguſt and ſurprize, which the general expreſſed at ſeeing him; and that he had peremptorily commanded him to quit Paris, and join his regiment immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; and farther informed him, that if he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to diſobey, he would have him broke with infamy.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0465000101:133"/>HE ſaid, he had however, reaſon to hope that the misfortunes he had met with, had ſoftened his father's heart, as he had been attended during his illneſs, by the firſt ſurgeons in Paris, who came to his aſſiſtance unſent for, and unpaid by him; and that if his ſufferings had made his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relent, he ſhould for ever bleſs the hand that had inflicted them.</p>
                           <p>THE pleaſing hope of her brother's recovery, was the moſt healing balm that could have been adminiſtered to Charlotte's wounded heart. She no longer trembled for his life, or what was dearer ſtill, lord Seymour's; and ſhe began in ſome meaſure, to be reconciled to her fate, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reflecting, that it might have been more wretched.</p>
                           <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all her efforts now to conquer it, her paſſion for lord Seymour remained undiminiſhed, and ſhe would have given worlds, had ſhe been miſtreſs of them, to undeceive him. But though her faithful Nannette had made the moſt diligent ſearch for him, from the time that captain Beaumont was pronounced out of danger, ſhe could not diſcover his retreat.</p>
                           <p>THE time now approached for Charlotte's ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the vow ſhe had made to heaven, by taking the veil. The cruel madame de Beaumont had made ſeveral fruitleſs efforts to prevail on the abbeſs to ſuffer her removal to another convent; but as ſhe feared to appear publickly in ſoliciting it, leſt the affinity between them ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, ſhe at laſt contented herſelf with endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to enforce the utmoſt ſtrictneſs and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which their rules would admit of; with which the poor innocent ſacrifice unreluctantly complied.</p>
                           <p>AS ſoon as captain Beaumont was tolerably recovered, he wrote again to his ſiſter, to inform
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0465000101:134"/>
her, that he had received an order from his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel to join his regiment immediately; and at the ſame time, a poſitive command from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to leave Paris without ſeeing her. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured her in the ſtrongeſt terms to renounce the veil, and to fly to lord Seymour for protection; and told her he was certain, that his lordſhip was ſtill in Paris, as he had juſt then diſcovered that he was the perſon who appointed and paid the ſurgeons for their attendance on him.</p>
                           <p>THE fair diſconſolate was now ſo enured to affliction, that ſhe bore this freſh mark of her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, inhumanity with gentleneſs and reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but alas! there was a woe ſuperior far to all they could inflict, and which like Aron's rod, had ſwallowed up the reſt. Lord Seymour thought her guilty ſtill!</p>
                           <p>SHE had preſerved the pacquet ſhe had made up for him, on the evening of their laſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view; and on the day preceding that, on which ſhe was to make her vows, ſhe received the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing lines from him.</p>

               <hi>Lady</hi> STRAFFON, <hi>to Lady</hi> WOODVILLE.</head>
            <p>THAT my dear Emily may not again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me, for attending equally to <hi>foreign</hi> and <hi>domeſtic</hi> affairs, I ſhall anſwer her two laſt letters, before I ſpeak my ſentiments of the truly amiable and unhappy Charlotte Beaumont. And firſt, of the firſt—Though you have deſired me not to reply to it, I find the ſubject ſo very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and alarming, that I cannot in juſtice to you or myſelf, comply with your requeſt—,</p>
            <p>YOU certainly muſt have lived ſome days upon eſſence of tea, and reduced your nerves to the loweſt ſtate imaginable, before your mind could be affected by the circumſtances you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Not that I would inſinuate that lord Woodville's ſudden confuſion was not the effect of a quick recollection, or conſciouſneſs of ſome former ſcene, which he perhaps might wiſh to have forgot. In all probability it aroſe from the remembrance of ſome diſaſtrous love adventure, which obtruded itſelf involuntarily upon his mind.</p>
            <p>THIS point which you have barely hinted at, I ſhall take for granted; and then endeavour to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0465000101:137"/>
ſhew you the abſurdity of being alarmed on ſuch an occaſion. Lord Woodville is now in his eight-and-twentieth year, and has lived both in forreign courts, and at home, as much in the gay world, as any man in England.—And can my dear Emily really ſuppoſe that ſhe was the firſt object of his love?—Impoſſible! It is much more reaſonable to imagine that he had felt that paſſion half a dozen times, at leaſt, before ſhe was out of her hanging ſleeves.</p>
            <p>BUT all girls flatter themſelves with the entire poſſeſſion of an huſband's heart; which if he happens as in your caſe, to be ſeven or eight years older than her, is no more in his power to beſtow, than youth or beauty. But if he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly grants you all that remains at that time in his gift, you have not the leaſt right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; and this, I firmly believe lord Woodville has done. Beware, then my Emily, of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ungrateful for this preſent; nor let him ever ſee that you do not conſider, even the remnant of his heart, as a full equivalent for all your own. This I muſt confeſs to be a very unequal lot of affections; but the conditions of life ſhould be acquieſced in, without too much refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—</p>
            <p>THERE never was an higher inſtance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy than lord Woodville's behaviour to you, in conſequence of the temple adventure; but do not give him too frequent opportunities of exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his gallantry:—you are a muſical lady; and know that a ſtring may be ſtrained, till it breaks. I am perfectly acquainted with the tenderneſs and ſenſibility of your nature; but you are not to judge of others, by your own fine feelings; or think your huſband deficient in affection, if he is not ſo minutely attentive to trifling circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0465000101:138"/>
as your delicacy may prompt you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LES petits ſoins</hi> belong moſt properly to female life: the great cares of the world are load ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the ableſt man. I have now done chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I hope for ever, as I never can he angry with my Emily, but when ſhe wounds herſelf.</p>
            <p>THE deſcription of your rural entertainment, pleaſed me much.—Whenever I go to Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, you ſhall take me to ſee your <hi>pocket Arcadia</hi>—No, upon ſecond thoughts, the ſcene would he incomplete without a ſwain; I therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you will preſent my compliments to Sir James Thornton, and tell him, that I appoint him my <hi>Ceciſbeo</hi> for that party, if we ſhould ever happen to meet at your houſe.</p>
            <p>I AM not at all ſorry that lord Seymour has left you.—The conſtant anguiſh which he muſt ever feel, was ſufficient to infect you all. This naturally leads me to the charming nun. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forgive your want of ingenuouſneſs, in not mentioning the million of tears, her ſtory muſt have coſt you—there never was any thing more affecting.—Lucy and I read and wept by turns—When one of us began to faulter, the other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to relieve her; but there were many paſſages that neither of us could repeat aloud, and only gazed ſilently on through the dim me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of our tears.</p>
            <p>IT really requires a perfect certainty of the facts, to ſuppoſe there ever were ſuch monſters in nature as the general, and madame de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont. But Charlotte's unhappy fate is but too ſtrong a voucher of their inhumanity. Yet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable as the lovely veſtal is, I think lord Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour much more wretched.—Time, devotion, and a thorough conſciouſneſs of the rectitude of all her actions, may calm her ſorrows; whilſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0465000101:139"/>
his muſt for ever be aggravated, by knowing that he has rendered her unhappy. I think him truly to be pitied. Adieu, my Emily.—Loves and good wiſhes from all here, accompany this to Woodfort.</p>

            <p>I HAVE at preſent, a houſe full of company; and therefore muſt content myſelf with barely acknowledging the receipt of my dear Fanny's friendly admonitions, which I frankly admit to be juſt, though I feel they are ſevere. Call me no more a ſpoiled child, when I ſo readily embrace the rod.</p>
            <p>LADY Lawſon has been here theſe three days. There have been odd reports about Sir William, and the young lady I formerly mentioned to you, who went to London, a few days before him. But I am perſuaded they are falſe; for on Sir William's return laſt night, lady Lawſon received him with the moſt genuine and unaffected delight, that could be expreſſed in looks or words; and I hear that miſs Fanning (that is the lady's name) is to return to Lawſon-Hall in a few days. The knight appeared a little embarraſſed; but that might be owing to the meeting his lady in ſo much company: we were all aſſembled at tea, and knew nothing of his return.</p>
            <p>YOU muſt not expect me to be a conſtant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent from York: the fatigue of dreſſing twice, nay perhaps thrice a day, will afford me but little time for more rational entertainment.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0465000101:140"/>
There are no moments which I think ſo totally loſt, as thoſe ſpent at the toilette; but the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of whatever place we are in, muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with. Your Emily has not reſolution ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſtem a torrent, and muſt therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be carried away with the ſtream. I will however, keep a ſort of journal of the occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of each day, and you muſt accept of that, in lieu of my letters.</p>
            <p>MY reaſon for not avowing how much I was affected, by the ſtory of the nun, was to avoid taking off that ſurprize, which gives ſtrength to every emotion.—When we are told that a trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is extremely tragical, we ſummon our reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to oppoſe the feelings of our hearts; and frequently ſuffer our pride to conquer its moſt graceful weakneſs: whereas, when we are taken by ſurprize, we give nature fair play, and do not attempt to combat with our humanity.</p>

            <p>I OUGHT, perhaps to be more thankful to my dear Emily for her laſt ſhort letter, than for any other ſhe has written to me. There is certainly the higheſt degree of merit, in giving pleaſure to others, when the effort is attended with trouble or difficulty to ourſelves. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing a quarter of an hour upon an abſent friend, while we are ſurrounded with the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:0465000101:141"/>
gaiety of preſent ones, ſhould always be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an high compliment.</p>
            <p>YOU may ſee by this remark, that I ſet a proper value upon your kind attention; but I am ſtill more charmed with your condeſcenſion, in admitting the juſtneſs of my arguments. Believe me, my dear, if we wiſh to be happy, we muſt make it a conſtant rule to turn awy our eyes, even from the minuteſt failings of thoſe we love; the ſuffering our thoughts to dwell long upon them, muſt inſenſibly leſſen our affection, and of courſe our felicity.</p>
            <p>THERE cannot in my mind be a more pitiable object, than a virtuous woman, who ceaſes to love her huſband.—What a dreadful vacuity muſt ſhe feel in her heart! How coldly and inſipidly muſt her life paſs away, who is merely actuated by duty, unanimated by love!</p>
            <p>WHERE there never has been paſſion, there may for aught I know, be a kind of mixed ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation compounded of eſteem, and mutual inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt that ſupplies the place of affection, to the inſenſible part of mankind.—If this were not the caſe, the generality of married people could not live ſo well together as they do.—But this wretched ſubſtitute, will never anſwer to a man or woman, who has once truly loved.</p>
            <p>I WOULD therefore moſt earneſtly recommend it to all thoſe, who are ſo happy as to be united to the object of their choice, to ſet the merits and attractions of each other, in the faireſt point of view to themſelves, and never, even for a moment, to caſt their eyes on <hi>the wrong ſide of the tapeſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOUR account of the kindneſs, with which lady Lawſon received her wandering ſwain, very fully proves that ſhe is an excellent wife; but is by no means a refutation of the reports relative
<pb facs="tcp:0465000101:142"/>
to him and miſs Fanning. Your ignorance of the world and its ways, make ſuch ſcenes appear extraordinary to you.—But alas! they are too frequent to be wondered at, in ſuch times as theſe.</p>
            <p>I SHALL not, my dear Emily, inſiſt upon your writing from York, if it is inconvenient to you: but as Fanny Weſton tells Lucy, that you do not ſet out from Woodfort this fortnight, every day of which I dare ſay, ſhe thinks a year; I may flatter myſelf with the hopes of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from you, perhaps more than once before you go.</p>
            <p>THAT ſurprize encreaſes our emotions, I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily admit; but, as you had no reaſon to doubt the tenderneſs of Lucy's nature, or mine, you might have communicated your own ſenſations, without fear of abating ours.</p>
            <p>SIR John is gone to London, for a ſhort time; and Lucy and I are to ſpend the days of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, not in retirement, as you might poſſibly ſuppoſe, but in diſcharging a heavy debt of viſits, which we owe to all the neighbourhood for five miles round. I think there are few ſmall evils that torture us ſo much, as what is generally called a good neighbourhood in the country.</p>
            <p>ADIEU, my dear Emily. I feel myſelf pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, at the idea of ſquandering my time, with perſons that I have not the leaſt wiſh to converſe with, and aſking ſimple queſtions without the ſmalleſt deſire to be informed. But as the world is conſtituted, we muſt compound for ſpending ſome part of our lives diſagreeably, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make ourſelves what amends we can, by enjoying that portion of it which is left to our own diſpoſal.</p>

               <hi>Lady</hi> WOODVILLE, to <hi>Lady</hi> STRAFFON.</head>
            <p>MY dear Fanny is extremely kind, in ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſet ſo high a value upon my ſmall, or rather no merit, in writing to her; for indeed I can never claim any, for what is to me the higheſt ſelf indulgence.—So a truce with your compliments, my too civil ſiſter.</p>
            <p>DO not be angry, Fanny; but I really cannot think with you, that true affection ſhould be founded on illuſion, which muſt be the caſe, if we are to be totally blind to the failings of thoſe we love.—On the contrary, I have always conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the raiſing our ideas, of the perſons we are to be united to, too romantically high, as one great ſource of matrimonial unhappineſs. By that means we became enamoured of a being, which exiſts not in nature, and feel ourſelves mortified and diſpleaſed as at a real diſappointment, when we diſcover that our imagination has exceeded the bounds of poſſibility.</p>
            <p>BUT if abſolute perfection were to be found on earth, it would wound our ſelf-love; and whatever injures that, can never be long dear to us. In the imperfections of our moſt amiable friends, we find a conſolation for our own, which forbids deſpair, and places the generality of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind pretty nearly upon a level. This equally creates confidence, and that naturally produces eſteem and love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0465000101:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>AS theſe are my real ſentiments, I think I may venture to tell you, that I am very ſorry I have never been able to diſcover one failing in my lord. I declare, Fanny, this is a humiliating ſituation, to a creature ſo conſcious of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand weakneſſes as I am; inſtead of reſtraining me from ſearching for his faults, I deſire you will immediately provide me with a magnifying glaſs to aſſiſt me in the diſcovering them.</p>
            <p>WHAT an horrid idea have you conjured up of a woman who ceaſes to love her huſband! There can be but two cauſes in nature that are capable of producing ſuch an effect—for I talk not of thoſe animals who never felt paſſion.—The firſt of theſe muſt be a conſtant ſeries of ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I ſuppoſe may at length conquer the tendereſt affection; and the unhappy ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er who continues to act up to her duty, under ſuch circumſtances, deſerves, in my mind, a much higher fame than any Greek or Roman, that ever yet exiſted.</p>
            <p>THE other cauſe muſt be owing to a ſhameful and vicious depravity of heart, commonly called inconſtancy; which to the honour of our ſex, I think I may ſay, is not frequent amongſt us. But when this happens to be the caſe, there is generally ſome new object in view; for that deſpicable wretch,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"a woman of gallantry never changes her firſt love, till ſhe is engaged in a ſecond."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I THANK heaven for my ignorance of the world, and its ways, as I hope and believe, I ſhall never have any trial, that may render a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them neceſſary. I know not what to think, with regard to lady Lawſon; but for my own eaſe I will hope the beſt, as it is impoſſible

that I ſhould be indifferent to any thing that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes her.</p>
            <p>SIR James Thornton has had an ugly fall from his horſe, and ſtrained his right arm, but has not received any dangerous hurt, though he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to his chamber. Lady Harriet, and Fanny Weſton are indefatigable in their attendance on him. I juſt now received a meſſage from him, to inquire my health; which ſeems a kind of tacit reproach, for not having been to viſit him—My ſiſter Lawſon and I ſpent all this morning in deſigning plans for a wood-houſe;—but as we are neither of us partial to our own inventions, we have laid them by, and determined to be rather good copyiſts than bad originals. We have both agreed, that it was poſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe any thing more truly elegant than that on the terrace of <hi>Taplow,</hi> which is to be our model. I have barely time to finiſh this, to dreſs, and look in upon Thornton before dinner. Adieu, my dear, Fanny! I may hear from you again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſet out for York.</p>

               <salute>My dear EMILY,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS I am perfectly convinced that in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our correſpondence I am much your debtor, on the article of the entertainment, I am pleaſed at having a little adventure to relate to you, though I cannot hope that the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0465000101:146"/>
recital will afford you as much pleaſure as the action gave me; but you muſt make the ſame allowance as you do for a play in your cloſet, and furniſh out all the ſcenery, decorations, &amp;c. from the ſtore-houſe of your own imagination.</p>
            <p>MY tale runs ſimply thus—As Lucy and I were returning home laſt night, from lady Vaughan's about eight o'clock, the ſky quite dark and rainy, one of the hind wheels of our carriage flew off; but as we were travelling at a very ſlow pace, in a miry road, we received no hurt from the accident—We were about three miles from Straffon Hill, which was rather too far for us to walk, as we were by no means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred for Peripatetics; and juſt as ill qualified for an equeſtrian expedition; we therefore ſent off the poſtilion on one of the horſes, to bring the coach to us—</p>
            <p>WE ſaw no friendly cottage near; but at the diſtance of a quarter of a mile in the fields, which ſeemed to us bright
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"as the Arcadian ſtar, or Tyran Cynoſure."</q>
one of the ſervants diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a path, that ſeemed to lead to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from whence theſe charming beams had iſſued.</p>
            <p>WE took him with us, and ſetting forward, ſoon reached the ſmall but hoſpitable dwelling. When we knocked at the door, a little neat coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try girl appeared, and after conducting us into a ſmall parlour, ſaid ſhe would acquaint her young lady, that there were ſtrangers there, but that her miſtreſs was at her devotions. We announced ourſelves to the girl, and ſhe retired.</p>
            <p>I WAS ſurprized at this young creature's mode of expreſſion; ſhe ſeemed greatly amazed at our appearance, but her aſtoniſhment could only be diſcovered by her looks. In a few minutes an elegant young woman about eighteen, entered
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0465000101:147"/>
the room, and after ſaluting us very gracefully, inquired to what happy accident ſhe was indebted for the honour of our viſit?</p>
            <p>THE courtlineſs of her addreſs, and the eaſe of her manners, were all new ſubjects of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, both to Lucy and me; which we could not help expreſſing, after we had informed her of the accident we had met with. She very politely offered us tea or coffee—we declined both—but there was a mch higher treat in her power, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the gratification of our curioſity, which we could not however venture to propoſe.</p>
            <p>WHEN we had ſat about a quarter of an hour, the little ſervant came in, and ſaid her lady was come out of the chapel, and would be glad to ſee us—we were immediately ſhewn into a room, the neatneſs and elegance of which it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deſcribe; at the upper end of it, on a ſmall ſofa, ſat a woman with the fineſt form, though pale and emaciated, that can be imagined.</p>
            <p>SHE roſe to receive us, with ſuch an affable dignity, as at once attracted our reſpect and love; ſhe was dreſſed in black, and appeared to be about five and thirty—though ſhe ſpoke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect good Engliſh, there was juſt ſo much of the foreign accent in her utterance, as muſt prevent your taking her for a native of this country.</p>
            <p>OVER the chimney of the chamber we ſat in, was a picture of a very handſome young man, and at the other end of the room, there hung one of the lady before us, in all the bloom of beauty, with her daughter, then about four years old by her ſide, and a boy that looked like a che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim, ſeated in her lap.</p>
            <p>AS I gazed on every object round me, with looks of admiration, which the lady of the houſe could not help obſerving, ſhe turned to me with an engaging ſmile, and ſaid, the ſurprize which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0465000101:148"/>
your ladyſhip is too polite to expreſs in words, is ſo porfectly viſible in your countenance, that it would appear like affectation to ſeem inſenſible of it; and as there is no part, either of my paſt or preſent life, that ſhould cauſe a bluſh to grow upon my cheek, I am ready to gratify that curioſity, which the extraordinarineſs of my ſituation, ſeems to have raiſed.</p>
            <p>IT will probably be near an hour, continued ſhe, before your carriage can arrive, and a much leſs time will ſerve to relate the few, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common events, that have placed me in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances you now ſee me. Both Lucy and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed our gratitude for ſuch an obliging offer, in the warmeſt terms, and intreated ſhe would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed—without more ceremony ſhe began.</p>
            <p>I AM a native of Italy, and deſcended from one of the moſt ancient families, of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic of Genoa—About twenty years ago, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came acquainted with a young Engliſh nobleman, called lord Somerville, whoſe picture you ſee there (pointing her beautiful hand towards the chimney; he was then upon his travels, and under age.—He became paſſionately in love with me, and ſoon inſpired me with more than grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; with honeſt heart felt love.</p>
            <p>WITH my permiſſion, he applied to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for his conſent to our marriage; well knowing that he could have no exception to his birth or fortune. We had not the leaſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of my father's refuſal—but we had both forgot that my lover was an <hi>heretic.</hi> This was deemed by him ſo material an objection to our union, that he declared he would confine me to a convent for life, rather than hazard my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſuch a marriage.—My lover was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to repeat his viſits, and I was ſent about twenty leagues off, into the country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0465000101:149"/>LORD Somerville ſoon diſcovered my retreat, and got acceſs to me, by the treachery or zeal of a ſervant, who was intruſted with the care of me. My father was informed of our interviews, and determined to ſend me directly to a convent at Naple's, where an aunt of my mother's was lady abbeſs. A particular accident let me into the ſecret of my intended doom, and I no longer heſitated to prefer love and liberty, to cruelty and confinement. After lord Somerville had given me the moſt ſolemn aſſurances, that I ſhould preſerve my religion inviolate, <hi>we</hi> were married, and ſet out privately in a felucca, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the purpoſe, which conveyed us both to Marſeilles.</p>
            <p>WHEN we came to Lyons, we were obliged to wait there for remittances from England, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we could proceed farther. After having long expected them in vain, my lord received a very ſevere and angry letter from his father, accuſing him with having ſtolen the daughter of an Italian nobleman, and commanding him to reſtore me to my parents, and return imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to England.</p>
            <p>THE diſtreſs of my huſband's mind, upon this occaſion, was not to be concealed; but it was a long time before he acquainted me with the real motives of his concern. Fondly and paſſionately as I loved him, I would have torn myſelf from his arms, and gone into a convent till his father's reſentment might have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, if my condition would have permitted it.</p>
            <p>BUT I was then far gone with child, of that young lady before you, and he in the tendereſt manner, aſſured me that not even the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of a father, ſhould have power to force him from me, till he had the happineſs of being
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0465000101:150"/>
himſelf a parent, and of ſeeing me in a ſituation to ſupport his abſence, or able to travel with him.</p>
            <p>WE had lived in the utmoſt retirement, and privacy from the time of our arrival at Lyon's—My lord had taken the name of Forteſcue, and no creature, except his banker, knew who he was—We were ſo perfectly happy in each other, that we wiſhed for no other ſociety—my lord amuſed himſelf with teaching me Engliſh—with ſuch a tutor, I ſoon became a conſiderable proficient; and at the time that my Laura was born, I could read and perfectly underſtand the moſt difficult Engliſh author's.</p>
            <p>AS ſoon as I was quite recovered, we ſet out for Paris, where my lord purpoſed leaving me, while he went over to England to pay his duty to his father, and to endavour to reconcile him to our marriage. I will not take up your time, with attempting to deſcribe our mutual ſufferings at our ſeparation; ſuch forms as yours, muſt have feeling hearts, and you can judge better than I deſcribe what we endured.</p>
            <p>MY Lord remained above a year in England, making repeated but fruitleſs efforts, to conquer his father's reſentment, againſt a perſon who had never in thought offended him; but, alas! my being a catholic, was as unpardonable a crime to him, as my dear huſband's being a proteſtant was to my father. Strange! that the worſhippers of one God, and Saviour, whoſe doctrine was peace and good will to men, ſhould feel ſuch enmity and hatred to each other!</p>
            <p>AT my lord's return to France, I could not help perceiving a viſible change, both in his health and ſpirits, though his fondneſs for me was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diminiſhed; or if poſſible, ſeemed to be increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by his tenderneſs for his daughter, who was then near two years old. As my lord concealed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0465000101:151"/>
great part of his father's unreaſonable averſion to me, I was not without hopes that time would conquer his prejudices; which indeed I only wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my lord's account; for while I enjoyed the real happineſs of his company, there was not a deſire of my heart ungratified.</p>
            <p>IN leſs than a year, that infant whoſe portrait you ſee there, was born.—From the time of his birth my lord's health and ſpirits ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, and I then certainly reached the zenith of human felicity; alas! how quickly did the wheel turn round, to lay me in the loweſt ſtate of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? With what rapture have I ſeen him catch the infant in his arms, and ſay, this boy, this boy, my love, will plead our cauſe with my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate father, and ſoften his hard heart? Would he were three years old!—but that bleſſed time will come, and we ſhall all be happy.—</p>
            <p>WHILE lady Somerville repeated the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, her countenance became more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, than it is poſſible to deſcribe; but a ſudden guſh of tears ſoon dimmed the brilliant luſtre of her eyes, and quenched the glowing crimſon on her cheek. She roſe, and opening a ſmall fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing door, retired into the chapel.</p>
            <p>THE young lady ſympathized moſt ſincerely, with her mother's ſorrow; and Lucy, and I who were extremely affected, were ſcarcely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making proper apologies, for having been the innocent cauſe of renewing both the ladies afflictions. Miſs Somerville ſaid every thing that politeneſs could dictate, to make us eaſy; and in a few minutes, lady Somerville re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with ſuch an air of calmneſs and reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as amazed me.</p>
            <p>I TOOK the liberty of entreating that ſhe would not proceed farther in her ſtory, for the preſent. But as I could not avoid being extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0465000101:152"/>
anxious about every circumſtance relative to ſo amiable a perſon, I requeſted ſhe would permit me to wait upon her, the next day, or when ever it was moſt agreeable to her inclination.</p>
            <p>SHE told me ſhe was very ſenſible of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy and propriety of my requeſt, which ſhe readily aſſented to, as it promiſed her the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of another interview with perſons, for whoſe ſenſibility and politeneſs, ſhe had conceived the higheſt reſpect: ſaid ſhe was a little aſhamed, that her long acquaintance with grief, had not yet rendered her ſo familiar with it, as ſhe might naturally be ſuppoſed to be; but hoped we would excuſe the ſudden emotion, which had for a few minutes tranſported her. She then intreated our company to drink tea, the next evening, and ſaid ſhe would, if poſſible, be more compoſed.</p>
            <p>IN about a quarter of an hour the coach ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and we took leave of this charming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, with the moſt earneſt deſire to renew our viſit, and the warmeſt hopes of being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to her and her daughter.</p>
            <p>I AM really fatigued with this long letter; but I would not ſuffer oblivious ſleep to ſteal any part of this axtraordinary adventure from my memory, till I had communicated it to my dear Emily.

            <p>LUCY and I ſet out immediately after dinner yeſterday, and reached lady Somerville's elegant cottage before five o'clock. As we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached it by day-light, we diſcovered many beauties that had been hidden from us by the dun ſhades of night; particularly ſeveral ſmall clumps of trees, that were encircled with wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, orange and lemon gourds, and intermixed with a great variety of flowering ſhrubs:—a ſmall, but neat garden, at the bottom of which ran a rivulet ſo clear, and ſparkling, as to appear like liquid diamonds.</p>
            <p>AS we drove by the pales of the garden, we perceived a building in it, that ſeemed to be fitted up for a gardener's houſe; and to our great aſtoniſhment, beheld a man of a very reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance, about ſixty years of age, ſeated in an arbour, with a book in his hand. We were received by both the ladies, with the ſame polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affability, as the day before. The fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doors which led to the chapel ſtood open: and indeed, Emily, there is no deſcribing the elegance, with which the alter is adorned.</p>
            <p>I AM an enemy to all devotional parade: yet I could not help conſidering the decorations of this ſacred ſpot, rather as the offerings of the heart to heaven, than a ſacrifice to vanity, as all the ornaments that are placed there, were the work of lady Somervill's and her daughters hands.</p>
            <p>AS ſoon as tea and coffee were removed, lady Somerville, without waiting to be intreated, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in her narrative, thus—When I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               </gap> the pinnacle of human fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, I forgot to inform you, that my father had been reconciled to me, for ſome time; and on the birth of my ſon, had preſented me with his picture ſet with diamonds and deſired the portrait of my lord, and thoſe of my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>BUT before this requeſt could be complied with, I had the misfortune to loſe my only parent.—His death was ſudden, and he died without a will. This was the firſt real affliction I had ever known; and my lord, in order to divert my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, propoſed our going to the ſouth of France.</p>
            <p>I ACQUIESCED in his deſire on his account, more than my own; for as his conſtitution was become extremely delicate, I hoped the change of air, might be of ſervice to him. We lived at Mantauban for near two years, during which time I had the conſtant anguiſh of beholding my dear huſband's health decline daily.</p>
            <p>AS he was perfectly ſenſible of his own ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he determined to take his little family to England, and preſent his ſon to his unkind father. Every thing was fixed for our departure, when Providence, to whoſe all-wiſe decrees I bow my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beneath the duſt, thought proper to recall the treaſure he had lent us, and took my little cherubim, to join the heavenly choir!</p>
            <p>NO words can expreſs the affliction of my loved lord, nor deſcribe the wretched ſtate both of his mind and his body. Whole days he hung enamoured over the pale beauteous clay that was his child, nor would he be prevailed upon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign it to corruption, till weakneſs left him not the power of oppoſition.</p>
            <p>FROM that time he ſunk into a ſtate, nearly approaching to inſenſibility, towards every thing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0465000101:155"/>

            <p>YOU may ſuppoſe that lady Somerville was for ſome time deprived of ſpeech; nor was there one of us capable of interrupting the melancholy ſilence, but by our ſighs. She however ſoon dried her tears, and reſumed her diſcourſe.—I ſhall relate the reſt of my ſtory, ſaid ſhe, though to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unintereſting to myſelf, as it will account for my preſent ſituation.</p>
            <p>I WAS about four months gone with child, at the time of my lords illneſs; and his laſt requeſt to me was, that I would if poſſible, lye-in in England, and acquaint his father with my preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, as ſoon as I arrived there. He told me that if the child I carried ſhould be a ſon, it would inherit the fortune and honours of his family; but if not, that there was no proviſion made for me, or any daughters I might have, as he was under age, at the time he married; and that the eſtate was intailed upon a very diſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. He implored me to preſerve my life, for the ſake of the poor Laura; and to throw myſelf and her into his father's protection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0465000101:156"/>AS it is utterly impoſſible that I ſhould give you an adequate idea of my ſituation, at that time, I will not attempt it; but endeavour to caſt a veil over that ſcene of diſtreſs, which no pen, no pencil, can ever be able to deſcribe.</p>
            <p>I SET out from Montauban, with my maid, my chaplain, and my child, and arrived ſafe in London. I obeyed my dear lord's requeſt, and wrote immediately to his father. His lordſhip was then in the country. He anſwered my letter with great civility, mixed with an affectation of kindneſs: ſaid he ſhould be in town ſhortly, that he would then ſee me, and deſired I would take care of myſelf for the ſake of the unborn babe, which he hoped would prove a ſon and heir.</p>
            <p>IN a few days after I had received this letter, I was informed that there were perſons appointed to attend me, till I was brought to bed, leſt I ſhould impoſe a ſurreptitious child upon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. I knew not that ſuch proceedings were uſual in my caſe, and I wrote a letter to my father-in-law, complaining of ſuch treatment, to which he never deigned a reply.</p>
            <p>BUT all their apprehenſions on my account, were ſoon over: I was delivered, in the ſeventh month, of a dead ſon; and from that time I heard nothing farther from my lord's father, or any of his family, for above ſix months. The little money I had brought with me into Egland, was now quite exhauſted; and I was obliged to apply, heaven knows how unwillingly! to this inhuman parent, for ſome means of ſupport, for his ſon's widow, and grandchild.</p>
            <p>IN his reply to my letter, he told me what I knew before, that neither my daughter nor I were entitled to any thing by law; that therefore he adviſed me to go back to my own country; and he would furniſh me with money to carry
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0465000101:157"/>
me there, provided I would leave Laura in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to his care. That if I ſhould refuſe theſe terms, I muſt even provide for myſelf as it was not his purpoſe to offer me any others.</p>
            <p>WHEN the mind has been once totally ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſorrow, we flatter ourſelves, that we are incapable of being wounded by any new diſtreſs: but the idea of being torn from the dear remains of my loved lord, my only child, convinced me that there were ſtill ſome arrows in the quiver of adverſity, that had not yet been pointed at my peace.</p>
            <p>I DID not heſitate one moment, to determine that no conſideration ſhould make me conſent to a ſeparation, from all that was now dear to me on earth. I muſt, indeed, have been abſolutely void of humanity as himſelf, if I could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned my child into the hands of a man, who had neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> even deſired to ſee her before.</p>
            <p>I WROTE immediately to my brothers at Genoa, and acquainted them with my diſtreſs. They very kindly aſſured me, that they would receive me and my daughter, with open arms at our return; but if it ſhould be my choice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in England, they would take care that I ſhould not want a ſupport there. They immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately remitted me bills for a thouſand <hi>piaſters,</hi> and agreed to ſettle the ſame ſum annually upon me, or more if I ſhould have occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>AT this inſtance of generoſity and affection, my heart once more became expanded with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to the Almighty, and with true ſiſterly tenderneſs to my benefactors. I now began to make the firſt efforts towards ſubduing the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of my grief, and to be ſenſible that I might have been rendered ſtill more wretched than I was, by the deprivation of my child, or our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to ſlavery for bread.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0465000101:158"/>I SOON fixed upon the plan of life which I meant to purſue, and ſent my worthy chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain and my faithful maid, in ſearch of a retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as you now ſee. In this ſpot I have lived about eight years, in which time I have had no manner of converſe with any human creature but my own family; which now conſiſts of my daughter, my chaplain and myſelf; my gardener, his wife and the little maid, their daughter, whom your ladyſhip has ſeen.</p>
            <p>THE only additional misfortune I have known in this place was the loſs of my faithful Maria: ſhe died about two years ſince; and as my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was then of age not to need her attendance, I have never attempted to ſupply her place.</p>
            <p>RUSTICATED ſo long as we have been, you will not I hope, ladies, be ſurprized at the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of mine or my daughter's manners.—Our ſituation is certainly a very extraordinary one, and muſt naturally have raiſed your curioſity, which I have endeavoured to gratify by a plain and artleſs narrative.</p>
            <p>I WISH for your ſakes, as well as my own, that my ſtory had been leſs affecting; but I ſhall not make any apology for having drawn forth the lovely drop of ſympathetic ſorrow, which glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with brighter luſtre on your cheeks than the moſt coſtly brilliant.</p>
            <p>BOTH Lucy and I poured forth our thanks, for her kindneſs and condeſcenſion in relating her ſtory; admired the conſtancy of her reſolution in remaining ſo long in retirement, but ſeemed to hope that ſhe might change her purpoſe. I ſaw ſhe was diſpleaſed at ſuch a hint; but with great politeneſs, ſaid it was the only ſubject ſhe did not wiſh to hear us talk upon, as it would always give her pain to diſſent from our opinion, which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0465000101:159"/>
ſhe muſt ever do, both in word and deed, upon that ſubject.</p>
            <p>I THEN ventured to aſk her if ſhe wiſhed that miſs Somerville ſhould paſs her life in ſuch a ſtate of ſecluſion? She ſaid by no means;—ſo far from it, that ſhe ſent forth a thouſand fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs wiſhes, that ſome lucky accident might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to introduce her to perſons of ſenſe and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and of a proper rank, to lead her gently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life; that ſhe had heard the characters of all the perſons of faſhion in that neighbourhood from her chaplain, who frequently mixed with the world in order to tranſact her affairs;—that as ſhe was above flattery, ſhe was alſo ſuperior to diſguiſe, and frankly owned that her utmoſt wiſh in this world would be gratified, if lady Straffon would promiſe her protection to her dear orphan.</p>
            <p>I SCARCE ſuffered her to finiſh the latter part of her ſpeech before I flew to and embraced her, and with great truth aſſured her, that my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions met hers, more than half way. I begged that from that moment ſhe would do me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to conſider me as her ſiſter, and that the lovely Laura might be henceforth deemed my niece.</p>
            <p>EVERY thing that delicate gratitude could dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate was uttered upon this occaſion; and we all appeared to be infinitely happier than we could have ſuppoſed it poſſible for us to be in ſo ſhort a time, after having been ſo very much afflicted.</p>
            <p>LADY Somerville concluded with informing me, that her father-in-law had been dead about four-years, and had left miſs Somerville ſix-thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds. We agreed that Lucy ſhould bring Laura to Straffon-Hill to-morrow; and I promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0465000101:160"/>
to convey her back to her ladyſhip whenever ſhe required her attendance.</p>
            <p>YOU cannot, my dear Emily, yes you can conceive the ſincere pleaſure I feel at having it in my power to oblige the amiable and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate lady Somerville. It muſt certainly be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite relief to her mind to know that her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has a friend and protector, in caſe Providence ſhould be pleaſed to put a period to her woes and take her to his mercy. But ſhe muſt neceſſarily ſuffer a great deal in being ſeparated from her till uſe ſhall have made it eaſy.</p>
            <p>LAURA is but juſt ſeventeen, though ſhe looks rather older from the gravity and dignity of her appearance. I flatter myſelf you will receive ſome entertainment from this narrative, which I have been as exact in as my memory would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and indeed it has for the time ſo intirely engroſſed my attention, that I am pretty ſure I have not omitted a circumſtance of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>I EXPECT Sir John will return from London the beginning of next week.—I hope he will be charmed with our young viſitor; and that lady Somerville will ſuffer him ſometimes to ſpend an hour with her.</p>

               <hi>Lady</hi> WOODVILLE to <hi>Lady</hi> STRAFFON.</head>
            <p>I MOST ſincerely congratulate my dear Fanny upon the acquiſition ſhe has made to her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by her acquaintance with lady Somerville. There was ſomething extremely romantic in the opening of your adventure, and I almoſt began to imagine that you had taken a trip to Fairy land; but every circumſtance, though ſurpriſing at firſt, is very naturally accounted for in the courſe of your narrative. I truly compaſſionate the unhappy lady's ſituation; and again felicitate you on having it in your power to remove a very material part of her diſtreſs, by affording your friendſhip and protection to her daughter.</p>
            <p>LADY Somerville's misfortunes are of the hopeleſs kind; it is not in the power of fate to reſtore her huſband, or her ſon; and ſlight ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers would for theſe reaſons, pronounce her much more wretched than thoſe who are led on by a faint glimpſe of hope to wander through the thorny paths of life in ſearch of ſome imaginary bliſs, which ſtill cludes their graſp. But I think otherwiſe. When the grave cloſes on our joys, our proſpect of this world muſt all end there; we can no more deceive ourſelves, or be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We ſink, it is true, and fall with the dear prop which fate has torn away. Then reaſon and religion come to our aid; and when the firſt wild ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts of grief are over, an humble acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; in the divine will ſooths our ſad ſouls to peace; or hopes ſpring forward to another goal, and pierce beyond the ſtars.</p>
            <p>BUT while vain doubts and fears torment the heart, while paſſion has poſſeſſion of the ſoul, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0465000101:162"/>
ſtill impels us forward through amaze, where our bewildered reaſon finds no clue, where peace is loſt and keen diſquiet fills its vacant place; where our deſires are raiſed but to be mocked, and cruelty repaid for artleſs love!—Sure, ſure, this ſtate is worſe, far worſe than lady So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merville's! She feels the ſtroke of death; but lady Harriet feels a living torture! inflicted too by whom her ſoul adored.</p>
            <p>I HAVE been led into this reflection by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that lady Harriet's health and ſpirits have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined viſibly, ever ſince her unlucky interview with captain Barnard; and I am certain that his almoſt perpetual reſidence at Ransford-Hall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes her diſquiet. In his firſt act of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, ſhe might with great reaſon imagine that fortune only had turned the ſcale in favour of her rival, and ſhe had ſtill the melancholy conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuppoſing herſelf beloved, though by a worthleſs man.</p>
            <p>HIS preſent attachment can ariſe only from choice or galantry: and it is certainly much more difficult to bear contempt, than injury. Had he died at that time he left her in Paris, her grief for his loſs would by this time have been ſoftened into a gentle melancholy, which though it might for ever have barred her pretenſions to happineſs, would not have rendered her half ſo wretched as ſhe is at this moment, and I fear will ever be.</p>
            <p>LET not what I have ſaid upon this ſubject make my dear Fanny think that I am not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely affected with lady Somerville's diſtreſs.—I acknowledge that her ſufferings have been great, but they certainly came to a period when her huſband died; and time has, I doubt not, inſenſibly leſſened her affliction. I alſo hope that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0465000101:163"/>
there is yet in reſerve for her, the felicity of ſeeing her daughter amiable and happy.</p>
            <p>ADIEU, my dear Fanny; my lord, and all this family ſalute you and yours moſt affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. I deſire you will preſent my reſpects to lady Somerville and her daughter, both of whom I hope to have the pleaſure of ſeeing when next I am ſo happy as to viſit Straffon-Hill.</p>

               <salute>My dear EMILY,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM ſo ſincerely charmed at the hope of your prophecy in favour of lady Somerville being immediately accompliſhed, that I can neither think, ſpeak or write upon any other ſubject.—Sir John returned from London in two days after Laura had become our gueſt; ſhe and I were juſt come back from paying an evening viſit to lady Somerville, when he entered the drawing room, and introduced a young Italian nobleman, who had been recommended to him, by one of his moſt intimate friends at Paris.</p>
            <p>I NEVER beheld a handſomer youth; tall graceful and finely made, with the ſtrongeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſenſe and ſweetneſs in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance—as he cannot ſpeak Engliſh our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was intirely Italian, in which, though Lucy and I are tolerable proficients, we were greatly excelled by Miſs Somerville, who has had the advantage of converſing with her mother, in that charming language from her earlieſt infancy.</p>
            <p>THE firſt two or three days that our young
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0465000101:164"/>
foreigner ſpent with us, we imagined that his devoting the largeſt ſhare of his time and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to Laura was owing to the eaſy fluency with which ſhe ſpoke his native language; but his motives remained not long doubtful; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very particular in his inquiries about her to Sir John, who gave him the fulleſt information of her birth and ſituation in life. He ſeemed charmed at the account of both, and from that time his aſſiduity towards her appeared leſs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed.</p>
            <p>NOR is the gentle heart of Laura inſenſible to his attentions; her bluſhes, when he is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and down caſt looks when he addreſſes her, plainly diſcover the ſtate of her artleſs mind. She is really a very fine creature, Emily, and I am truly anxious for her happineſs. She has a ſenſibility, a frankneſs, a delicate ingen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouſneſs of nature, not to be found in thoſe who have had much commerce with the world, which ſhe owes to her ſequeſtered education with a parent, whoſe natural ſoftneſs has been increaſed by a long acquaintance with affliction.</p>
            <p>BUT to the purpoſe—Laſt night the enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lodovico explained his ſentiments to Sir John, and intreated him to prevail on me to introduce him to lady Somerville; though he confeſſed that he found Laura extremely averſe to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal which muſt for ever divide her from the tendereſt of mothers; but as ſhe ſeemed to have no other objection, he flattered himſelf that this might be ſurmounted.</p>
            <p>SIR John's friend, lord Mount Willis, who recommended Lodovico to him, informed him that he is deſcended from one of the firſt families at Genoa, that he is an only ſon, intitled to a very large fortune, and ſtill poſſeſt of a much higher treaſure.—an unexceptionable character.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0465000101:165"/>I NEEDED not much perſuaſion, to enter upon ſuch a pleaſing embaſſy.—I waited on lady So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merville this morning; ſhe ſeemed a little alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Laura's not being with me. I quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved her apprehenſions, by explaining the cauſe of my viſit. She heard me with the utmoſt attention, but could not help dropping ſome tears when I mentioned Laura's objection to quitting her.</p>
            <p>LADY Straffon, ſaid ſhe, when I had finiſhed my diſcourſs, though my girl's affection awakens all my tenderneſs for her, I will not ſuffer her to ſacrifice her welfare to my ſelfiſh ſatisfaction.—The world contains but one object for me; let her be happy, and contribute to the happineſs of a deſerving huſband, and I ſhall taſte the only <hi>joy</hi> my heart is capable of. And ſhould that long abſent <hi>gueſt</hi> ever deign to viſit me again, it is to you the bleſſed miniſter of Providence, to whom I am indebted for its preſence.</p>
            <p>I ENDEAVOURED to reſtrain the grateful effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of her generous heart, by aſſuring her that I felt almoſt as much pleaſure as even ſhe could be ſenſible of from the proſpect of Laura's future happineſs.—We then agreed that I ſhould bring Laura and Lodovico to wait upon her in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon.—The inſtant I return I will acquaint you with the reſult of our viſit; till then,</p>

               <hi>Lady</hi> STRAFFON, <hi>to Lady</hi> WOODVILLE.</head>
            <p>(In continuation.)</p>
            <p>JOIN with me, my deareſt Emily, in rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the happineſs which opens to the view of our amiable friends. But I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you from the events which create their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent joy. I carried my two young gueſts, Laura and Lodovico, this afternoon to lady Somerville's cottage; ſhe received us with her uſual grace and elegance: but when I preſented ſignior Lodovico to her, I fancied I perceived a change of countenance, which I knew not how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for. However ſhe preſently recovered herſelf, and continued to entertain us with the greateſt politeneſs.</p>
            <p>AFTER tea, I took Laura into the garden, under pretence of admiring a little grotto ſhe had lately finiſhed in order to give the young gentleman an opportunity of explaining his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to her mother. We had not been ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes abſent, when the little country maid came running to us, and deſired we would return im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
            <p>WE were not a little ſurprized at this ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; but judge how our wonder was increaſed on finding lady Sommerville with her eyes ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Lodovico ſeated by her, with an air that ſpoke him a ſharer in her emotions! The moment we entered the room, ſhe ſtarted up, and taking her daughter's hand, come, ſaid ſhe, come and embrace your couſin, the ſon of that friend, that more than brother, to whom we have been indebted for the means of life ſo many years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0465000101:167"/>POOR Laura was unable to ſpeak; but her eyes fully expreſſed the tender and grateful ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her heart. The enraptured Lodovico ſeemed totally abſorbed in the pleaſure of gazing on her.—After ſome time, lady Somerville turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, ſaid, You ſee before you, my dear lady Straffon, the only ſon of count Meleſpini.—The inſtant I ſaw him, I was ſtruck with the reſemblance of that much loved brother.—But how could I flatter myſelf with the happineſs of beholding his ſon!</p>
            <p>AND now, my dear children, continued ſhe, though my conſent awaits ye, be aſſured, that without the court's concurrence, this union ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can take place; write to him therefore, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico, and let both him and you reſt ſatisfied, that his will ſhall in this affair determine mine.</p>
            <p>IN the mean time, I hope, ſaid ſhe, your ladyſhip will diſpenſe with Laura's attendance at Straffon-Hill. Perhaps my brother may have other views for his ſon; if ſo, it is beſt not to indulge an affection too far, which may be productive of unhappy conſequences: for, be aſſured, that however deſerving the object, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever virtuous the attachment, no marriage can be truly bleſt, that pains a parent's heart.—A too energic ſigh accompanied theſe words: but, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhe, when lady Straffon honours me with her company, I hope my nephew will attend her.</p>
            <p>IT was very viſible that Lodovico complied reluctantly with theſe conditions; and perhaps Laura, for the firſt time, found obedience diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.—But as her ladyſhip ſeemed determined, a bow of aſſent was the only reply that was made. Signior Lodovico and I returned home, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this converſation.</p>
            <p>BY the way he accounted to me for not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0465000101:168"/>
that lady Somerville or Laura were related to him, as he had always heard them call State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villa, which is their name in Italian. I find he intends making as much uſe as poſſible of the privilege of attending me to lady Somerville's; ſo that I expect to paſs much of my time at the cottage.</p>
            <p>HE is now retired to acquaint his father with the happy diſcovery he has made of his relations, and his ſentiments towards his fair couſin. I ſhall be truly impatient for the count's anſwer.—I hope it will be favourable; if it ſhould not, I fear all lady Somerville's precaution will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to prevent the attachments of the young people, though I believe it would be impoſſible to draw Laura from her obedience.</p>
            <p>I HAVE been ſo much engaged in the affairs of the Somerville family for theſe two days, that I have ſcarce had leiſure to think of my own.—You may therefore excuſe my not entering upon the critical diſtinctions you have made on the various modes of miſery in your laſt letter. I heartily wiſh you would take the oppoſite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme for your ſubject, and deſcant on your own happineſs; which I believe to be as perfect as this frail ſtate will admit of. May it long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo, ſincerely wiſhes,</p>
