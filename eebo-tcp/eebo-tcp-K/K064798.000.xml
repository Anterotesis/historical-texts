            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER TO Mr. DAVID HUME.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING for a long time conceived the higheſt eſteem for the variety of your literary merit, a recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from you was almoſt a ſanction to pre-engage my implicit approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How high were my expectations raiſed by your dedicatory commendation of <hi>the tragedy of Douglas</hi>; but, alas! how fallen, from ſeeing its repreſentation: nor has a peruſal ſince won me over as an admirer of it.</p>
            <p>Had the tragedy of <hi>Douglas</hi> been uſhered into the world as the promiſe of a dramatic genius, as ſuch it ought to have been received with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; but its having been forced upon us au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively, in competition with all antiquity and the moderns, two obvious effects were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the minds of men; to wit, curioſity was excited in ſome, jealouſy provoked in others. I am ſorry to inform you, Sir, that in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, your <hi>national</hi> judgment has been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0452801100:3"/>run upon here, and your critical ſtocks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced almoſt to bankruptcy.</p>
            <p>For my part, when I firſt read your panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical paragraph, I for ſome time heſitated as to the ſincerity of it, and could not help reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the paſſage in <hi>The Art of Sinking in Poetry,</hi> written by your truly ingenious countryman Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Take all the beſt qualities you can find in the moſt celebrated heroes; if they will not be reduced to a conſiſtency, lay them <hi>all in a heap</hi> upon him. But be ſure they are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which your <hi>patron</hi> would be <hi>thought to have</hi>; and to prevent any miſtake which the world may be ſubject to, ſelect from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet thoſe capital letters that compoſe his name, and ſet them at the head of a dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
            <p>But, on a ſecond reading of it, I changed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and have moreover been aſſured, that what is written you meant, to which, in amaze, I uſed the famous reply of "<hi>Eſt il poſſible,</hi>" is it poſſible?</p>
            <p>The four great and revered names, <hi>Maffei, Voltaire, Olway, Shakeſpear,</hi> which you have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as ſupporters of <hi>Douglas,</hi> put me in mind of the ſtatue of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. in <hi>Paris,</hi> where the four nations, <hi>Germany, Spain, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are chained round him as vanquiſhed, and laviſhly accompanied with all the tokens of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. However this may pleaſe the national vanity of the <hi>French,</hi> all foreigners with reaſon laugh at the folly of the deſign, and unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able foppery of the execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0452801100:4"/>I reſpect you too much, Sir, to make any unmannered or indelicate application: ſuch as "All fools admire, but men of ſenſe approve;" and ſhall impeach you by an evidence whom I dare ſay will not be objected to, yourſelf—and from the ſtandard of taſte.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Strong ſenſe united to delicate ſentiment, improved by practice, perfected by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable character; and the joint verdict of ſuch, whenever they are to be found, is <hi>the true ſtandard of taſte and beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Juſt expreſſions of paſſion and nature are ſure, after a little time, to gain public vogue, which they maintain for ever.</p>
            </q>
            <p>According to this juſt and admirable doctrine, what is likely to be the fate of <hi>the tragedy of Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas?</hi> Neglect and oblivion: however illumined for the preſent by the flambeau, you (forgive the expreſſion,) too partially, or in the mildeſt terms, too ſanguinely, hold before it.</p>
            <p>Not ſatisfied to have preluded to the aſſured triumph of this tragedy in your dedication, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked and congenial enforcer of the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of its merit, has been artfully diffuſed thro' the public under the title of <hi>The Tragedy of Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas analyſed,</hi> a ſeeming attack, which the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed reader finds to be the ſecond part of the ſame tune you had begun in your dedication, and which is there quoted, in order to be illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated true in every article; therefore, to join iſſue the ſooner, we ſhall follow the method there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in obſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0452801100:5"/>From page ſeventh to twelfth is a tedious hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical account of the fable, quite too long for the propoſed limits of this letter, to be quoted, and therefore I refer to it.</p>
            <p>The next heads proceeded to, are the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, manners, and diction. Having nothing to object againſt what the analyſer ſays relative to the two former, the following citations will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhew that our diſapprobation ariſes not from caprice, but very juſtifiable motives.</p>

            <p>Why has the panegyriſt taken notice but of three performers, and natives of <hi>Ireland?</hi> ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful partiality!

            <p>The actor of lord <hi>Randolph</hi> was ſelf-collected, having the curb of his paſſions in hand. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited a commanding calmneſs of deportment, and a level, ſtomach-fetched, dignity of voice.</p>

            <p>The ground-work of the play is an abſolute abſurdity, for either the lady <hi>Randolph</hi> muſt have been very artful, who had a chopping boy 18 years before, to paſs on her husband for a maid; or he, lord <hi>Randolph,</hi> muſt have been very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the affairs of women. I fear the latter caſe; and from ineffectual nights ſprung the daily cauſe of her tears; and certainly a very material one. <hi>Penelope,</hi> it is true, mourned twenty years for <hi>Ulyſſes</hi>; but then ſhe did not admit an <hi>apathic</hi> lover to tantalize her in bed.</p>
            <p>The ſhepherd, the jewels, and recognition of this doleful piece, are worn-out devices of the ſtage, and expletive pegs of the human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
            <p>The protracted monotony of lady <hi>Randolph</hi>'s grief is irkſome. One character often exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame piece, muſt be agitated by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
