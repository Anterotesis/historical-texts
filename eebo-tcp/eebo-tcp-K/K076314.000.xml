            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>WHY, to our Wonder, in this Place is ſeen,</l>
               <l>Thus diſcompos'd, and alter'd, <hi>Juda</hi>'s Queen?</l>
               <l>May we demand, what Terrors ſeize your Breaſt,</l>
               <l>Or, why your Steps are to this Houſe addreſt,</l>
               <l>Where your unguarded Perſon ſtands expos'd</l>
               <l>To ſecret Foes, within its Walls inclos'd?</l>

               <l>No more! but Both obſerve what I relate:</l>
               <l>Not, that I mean (recalling Times of Blood)</l>
               <l>To make you Judges of the Paths I trod,</l>
               <l>VVhen to the empty'd Throne I boldly roſe,</l>
               <l>Treating all Intercepters as my Foes.</l>

'Twas Heav'ns Decree, that I ſhould thus ſucceed,</l>
               <l>Whoſe following Favour juſtifies the Deed,</l>
               <l>Extending my unlimited Command</l>

               <l>Whilſt your <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> all Peace enjoys,</l>

               <l>The great <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> Terror of your Kings,</l>
               <l>Who bought his Friendſhip with their holieſt Things,</l>
               <l>Yields that a Siſter, of his pow'rful Race,</l>
               <l>Should ſway theſe Realms, and dignify the Place.</l>
               <l>Nor need we add the late inſulting Foe,</l>
               <l>The furious <hi>Jehu</hi> does this Sceptre know,</l>
               <l>And ſinks beneath the Load of conſcious Fears,</l>
               <l>When in <hi>Samaria</hi> he my Actions hears.</l>
               <l>Diſtreſt by Foes, which I've againſt him rais'd,</l>

At leaſt, till now thus glorious was my State;</l>

               <l>Hangs on my penſive Heart, and bears it down</l>
               <l>More than the weight of an objected Crown,</l>
               <l>My Mother (be the Name with Rev'rence ſpoke!)</l>
               <l>Ere chearful Day thro' horrid Shades had broke,</l>

               <l>Thus all array'd, in ſuch defying Pride</l>

               <l>My Arms I thought to throw about the Shade</l>

            <head>REFORMATION.</head>
            <l>A Gentleman, moſt wretched in his Lot,</l>

            <l>Who, tho' ſhe curb'd his Pleaſures, and his Food,</l>
            <l>Call'd him <hi>My Dear,</hi> and did it for his Good,</l>
            <l>Ills to prevent; She of all Ills the worſt,</l>
            <l>So wiſely Froward, and ſo kindly Curſt.</l>
            <l>The Servants too experiment her Lungs,</l>
            <l>And find they've Breath to ſerve a thouſand Tongues.</l>
            <l>Nothing went on; for her eternal Clack</l>
            <l>Still rectifying, ſet all Matters back;</l>
            <l>Nor Town, nor Neighbours, nor the Court cou'd pleaſe,</l>
            <l>But furniſh'd Matter for her ſharp Diſeaſe.</l>
            <l>To diſtant Plains at length he gets her down,</l>
            <l>With no Affairs to manage of her own;</l>
            <l>Hoping from that unactive State to find</l>
            <l>A calmer Habit, grown upon her Mind:</l>

            <l>And no harſh Miſtreſs domineers, or rails?</l>
            <l>Not rail! ſhe cries—Why, I that had no ſhare</l>
            <l>In their Concerns, cou'd not the Trollops ſpare;</l>
            <l>But told 'em, they were Sluts—And for the Swains.</l>
            <l>My Name a Terror to them ſtill remains;</l>
            <l>So often I reprov'd their ſlothful Faults,</l>
            <l>And with ſuch Freedom told 'em all my Thoughts,</l>
            <l>That I no more amongſt them cou'd reſide.</l>
            <l>Has then, alas! the Gentleman reply'd,</l>
            <l>One ſingle Month ſo much their Patience try'd?</l>
            <l>Where you by Day, and but at Seaſons due,</l>
            <l>Cou'd with your Clamours their Defects purſue;</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Phoebus</hi> (howe'er miſtaken Poets dream)</l>
               <l>Ne'er us'd a Verſe, till Love became his Theme.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Love without Poetry's refining Aid</l>
