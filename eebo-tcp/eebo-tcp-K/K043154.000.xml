            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I like the fancy of all things, and can antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in idea laughter without end from it.

                  <speaker>Manuel.</speaker>
                  <p>The beſt of the joke is, old Rodriguez, her Grace's woman, takes every thing ſeriouſly; and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to ſee a fellow like Sancho Panca dignified with the title of governor, whilſt nothing is done for her after ſo many years attendance on the Ducheſs.</p>

                  <p>Yes; but the Duke has not yet given me my inſtruſtions in full. I wiſh you had over-heard Don Quixote this morning, admoniſhing Sancho for degrading his rank, by ſcuffling with one of the grooms over the grid-iron, about a brown cruſt and a raſher of bacon; He lookt as fierce as the knight of the burning ſword, or the knight of the burning peſtle, whilſt the chop-fallen Governor hung his head, as if he expected every minute to be cut into mince-meat, or pounded to a jelly. In pity to poor Sancho at laſt I interpoſed, and reſcued his Excellency from a rib-roaſting.</p>

                  <p>The worſt character you could have aſſumed to appear gracious in Sancho's eye; he has a mortal averſion to phyſicians and lawyers, ſince his beloved Dapple had like to have been killed by the quackery of a horſe-doctor, and he himſelf ruined by the knavery of a petty-fogging attorney. I ſhould not be ſurprized if he commence his government by iſſuing a proclamation for the extinction of both profeſſions, ſentencing the members of each to hang up, and poiſon one another.</p>

                  <p>If thou wouldſt make thyſelf a proper governor, be careful of thy morals—to have, or to be thought to have morality, is extremely uſeful for a governor; if it were nothing but to be a ſkreen, that people might not pry too curiouſly into his conduct, and proceedings—not but that his actions ought to be ſuch, as will bear the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny—yet if he be once reputed a moral man, let him be a Turk in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or religion, tis not three-half-pence matter—ſecondly my Sancho.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sancho.</speaker>
                  <p>Ecod I believe, Sir, my mother longed for them; its a diſeaſe that heaven alone can cure me of; I have proverbs enough to fill a large ſack; and when I talk, they crowd ſo thick to my mouth, that they quarrel which ſhall get out firſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Don Quixote.</speaker>
                  <p>The next thing, Sancho, is to be cautious in your choice of officers of truſt; remember you are but guardian of the <hi>people's treaſure,</hi> and muſt be careful to chuſe honeſt men.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sancho.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, maſter; but how am I to know them? after the ſteed's ſtol'n 'tis too late to ſhut the ſtable door. I intend to act with <hi>certainty</hi> in this caſe— and as I am ſure my people will not produce any man that's honeſter than their governor, I will inſtantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>myſelf,</hi> firſt lord of the treaſury of Barataria.</p>

                  <p>In that caſe, Sancho, I fear thy people will think thou haſt not ſo much diſintereſtedneſs, as thou ought'ſt. Prudently examine what thy income may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to in a year; then if thou can'ſt afford fourſcore ſervants, keep but half, and what wou'd maintain the others, give to the poor, that their bleſſings may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company thee wherever thou appearſt; in the execution of juſtice, act with ſtrict impartiality; avoid, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the taking of bribes; which is ſo tempting, and withal ſo crying a ſin, there is not one governor in forty can forbear damning himſelf by it.</p>

                  <p>Why then, lord have mercy upon my ſoul too; for to deal plainly I am afraid my fingers (as well as the reſt) will itch moſt curſedly to be handling the money. But, Sir, I hope, you'll allow there are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites, which its fair a man ſhould receive in all places; if it was not for the fees, ſome places wou'd not be worth the having; like the ſauce, to certain meats, which ſometimes exceeds the diſh itſelf.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0055103700:14"/>wiſhing you ſoon to be an emperor, we take our leave, to feaſt and give our iſlanders a play day, and meet our ſpouſe, who now muſt be a lady.</p>

                  <p>Well, then I remember my maſter bid me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them; ſo there they are again. Don't think you have got a Governor, who means to keep you under lock key, like ſo many pigs in a pound. Giving me the keys of your town, is as much as to ſay, you commit your rights and liberties to my charge, and I return them, to tell you that I do not mean to abuſe the truſt. And now, my honeſt friend, let us go to dinner</p>

                  <p>We mean your Lordſhip's anſwer to our dutiful and loyal addreſs.—It is uſual for the Governor, on theſe occaſions, to expreſs his approbation of our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment and loyalty to him in a ſpeech, and promiſe at the ſame time, to take every ſtep within the compaſs of his abilities conducive to our intereſt and welfare</p>

What ſignifies making fine promiſes before hand; it's very eaſy to make them to get into place, and eaſier ſtill to break them when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the ſaddle; no, no: on both ſides the proof of the pudding ſhall be in the eating of it. I'll approve of your loyalty, if I like the entertainment you have provided for me. Good governors always like good eating, and good citizens always take care to provide ſuch.</p>

                  <p>This comes, my Lord, from the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers in wool, intreating your encouragement; and as they have brought that commodity in quality to the fineſt linen cloth, beg that in future you wou'd wear it in ſhirts, and thus render the conſumption of that article univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.</p>

                  <speaker>MESSENGER,</speaker>
                  <p>Arm, arm, my Lord, you are nor ſafe a minute; heres news now come that ſeveral thouſand Buccaneers, pirates and banditti have enter'd your iſland; here's a letter too ſent from the Duke to give you notice of the danger, you muſt prepare for your defence immediately.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Signior Sancho—I have juſt learned that certain enemies of mine, and of the iſland meditate a deſperate and furious aſſault immediately; ſeveral ſpies are about your perſon, with intent to aſſaſſinate you; take care of yourſelf, and the charge committed to you; tranſmit me word what ſuccours you may want; your danger is great. Your friend the Duke</p>

                  <p>Oh! Unfortunate eſtate of this unhappy iſland; that becauſe of its wealth, and fertility, is perpetually plagued with enemies, who bear a mortal ſpite to all thoſe that rule; thoſe damn'd banditti, and buccaneers, have taken and ſlea'd three or four of our governors already.</p>

                  <p>Noble Don Sancho. The enemy gains ground every moment, therefore come away inſtantly to the citidal, that we may arm you, and put you at the head of your brave troops, who impatiently expect you.</p>

                  <p>But why all this hurry? 'odſlife! I know no more what belongs to fighting, than a General does of cow keeping.</p>

                  <p>They'll come upon us before we have taken up our arms; but it never ſhall be ſaid, that I ſtood tamely and ſaw ſo famous an iſland loſt; I'll go and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the gates as long as I can againſt them.</p>
