            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>IT is the misfortune of all <hi>great</hi> writers, to put pen to paper ſo faſt, and let their imaginations carry them away in ſuch a hurry, that they ſeldom conſider whether their readers comprehenſions will be able to gallop af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them poſt-haſte, without being out of breath, to the end of the firſt chapter, even tho' it ſhould not contain above a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0076500400:3"/>
dozen lines. And it is as great an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in judgment, — nay, worſe than that which <hi>Byng</hi> was ſhot for, to put too much wit in any production that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for univerſal reading — I ſay, univerſal reading: for, beſides the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of one of the greateſt writers of this or the laſt age, I cannot ſay which, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that a reader ſhould have as much wit as the author he reads, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him;"</q>—which I flatter myſelf is ſeldom the caſe. I ſpeak as an author, and therefore ſhould be allowed a little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: I ſay, beſides this generally received doctrine, how can we tell what different kinds of wit prevail with all the readers in the univerſe; — to go no further than the antipodes, it is a thouſand to one, whether they would underſtand a <hi>pun,</hi> or the beſt <hi>bon-mot</hi> in all <hi>Triſtram Shandy</hi>: — and for aught I can tell, in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0076500400:4"/>
the moon, and ſome other of the illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate planets, they may have exploded every kind of true wit mentioned by Addiſon. It is evidently for this reaſon, that in moſt of the periodical works, which are reckoned <hi>univerſal,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the magazines, we are very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom troubled with any thing but plain good ſenſe, the beſt method of making water-gruel, and fattening of capons; which may be of uſe, and underſtood all over the world.</p>

               <p>BEFORE we enter upon the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of theſe <hi>round aſſertions,</hi> it will be neceſſary to point out the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of a moraliſt. He ſhould have a fundamental knowledge of <hi>ethics,</hi> or that ſcience which fixes the oeconomy and conduct of human Life, that teaches the regulation of the paſſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs men to be happy, by practiſing all the ſocial virtues. He ſhould know how to adapt theſe rules to the various ſubjects he treats of, and point out ſuch evident and uncontrovertable concluſions in favour of morality, as every unbiaſſed reader muſt be ſenſible of the effect.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>A Moraliſt has generally one, two, three, four, five, ſix, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more things in view. Thoſe of the ſingular number, write for writing's ſake: thoſe of the firſt plural number, invert the rule of oeconomy, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"a penny ſaved is a penny got,"</q> and think, that in getting a penny, they do more than ſave one they have not, — ſo that they make writing and eating go hand in hand. The triple number have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſome new moral doctrine to broach, and, with the two former con-commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, add, that of ſelf-opiniated public ſervice. Then come the controvertiſts to theſe, and the recontrovertiſts, with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0076500400:9"/>
their anſwers, replies, and rejoinders, <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> ———But, before I launch out any further in the definition of a moral writer, I muſt inform my <hi>ſeven hundred and fifty readers</hi> that Mr. <hi>Triſtram Shandy</hi> is not among any of theſe claſſes. — He ſtands by himſelf upon the top ſhelf of ethics, — tho' but <hi>in twelves, —unrivalled, — inimitable,</hi> — and (to my ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty incomprehenſible readers) <hi>incomprehenſible.</hi> He muſt, therefore, be more fully explained than any of the foregoing moraliſts, — and, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I allow him beſt part of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheets for his public defence to <hi>the moral world.</hi>

               <p>THE firſt evident mark of Mr. <hi>Triſtram</hi>'s morals (which indeed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0076500400:10"/>
is no farther than the third page) is what he puts into his mother's mouth upon his father's <hi>regularity</hi> in winding up the houſe clock. <hi>Regularity</hi> every one knows is the corner-ſtone of virtue—and virtue is the foundation of morality— Thus far, then, Mr. <hi>Shandy</hi> goes on in a moral track to give us the hiſtory of his anti-birth.</p>
               <p>But what does the winding up of the clock allude to—and how comes it this thought always entered his mother's head once a month? This he very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally accounts for by an aſſemblage of ideas, according to Locke; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may want in <hi>decency,</hi> he very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably makes up by ſound philoſophy and his <hi>little men</hi>

               <p>IT would be difficult for me, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for my readers, to trace Mr. <hi>Triſtram Shandy</hi> through every part of his moral character: I ſhall therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine myſelf to ſuch traits as are the moſt ſtriking (tho' not ſelf-evident) and leaſt underſtood.</p>
               <p>Among theſe the following paſſage ſeems next to claim our attention. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The rituals direct the baptizing of the child, in caſe of danger, before it is born; but upon this proviſo, that ſome part or other of the child's body be ſeen by the baptiſer: but the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0076500400:12"/>
doctors of the Sorbonne, by delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, held amongſt them April 10, 1733, have enlarged the powers of the midwives, by determining, that though no part of the child's body ſhould appear, — that baptiſm ſhall nevertheleſs be adminiſtered to it by injection by means of a little ſquirt. 'Tis very ſtrange that St. Thomas Aquinas, who had ſo good a mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical head, both for tying and untying, the knots of ſchool-divinity, ſhould, after ſo much pains beſtowed upon this—give up the point at laſt, as a thing impoſſible."</q>

The ſurgeon, who makes this repreſentation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages, by means of a ſyringe, to baptize immediately the child, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any way hurting the mother.

The theologiſts have on one ſide eſtabliſhed a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that baptiſm, which is a ſpiritual birth, ſuppoſes a prior birth; we muſt be born into the world to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> according to their doctrine. St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> part. 3. quaeſt. 88. article 11. follows this opinion as an eſtabliſhed fact: we cannot (ſays that holy doctor) baptize children which are incloſed in their mothers wombs. By this St. Thomas means theſe children are not born, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be reckoned amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men: from whence he infers they cannot be the object of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal action, to receive thereby the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments neceſſary to ſalvation: Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri in maternis uteris exiſtentes non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum prodicerunt in lucem ut cum aliis hominibus vitam ducant, unde

               <p>SOME of the moſt comprehenſible of my readers muſt have obſerved, that I have ſcattered very little Greek and Latin about this work, and that I have even made ſhift with an <hi>Engliſh motto,</hi> notwithſtanding a claſſical one is ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the well underſtanding and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending a book, even though of this conſequence. —To be honeſt, I muſt own, that none of the family of the <hi>Ku<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtrokius</hi>'s were any great Grecians, — and, as to <hi>Latin,</hi> I always found it a very ſaleable commodity at the <hi>phyſical-market.</hi> But if any of my readers ſhould be deſirous to divert themſelves with a Greek or Latin quotation, I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them to read me with <hi>Homer, Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus, Virgil, Horace,</hi> and a few more of

               <p>THIS chapter is intirely upon <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,</hi> and muſt, therefore, of courſe, (with or without a <hi>pun</hi>) be a very proper chapter.</p>
               <p>Digreſſions are the ſoul of a work, as Mr. <hi>Triſtram Shandy</hi> has very judiciouſly diſcovered, and he has as tenaciouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to this diſcovery; — wherefore, he may, with the greateſt propriety, be ſtiled the king of <hi>epiſodical writers.</hi>
