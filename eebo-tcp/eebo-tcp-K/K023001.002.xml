            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>peccat in uno, periclatur in altero.</hi> But becauſe there is in Man an Election touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Frame of his Mind, and a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in the Frame of his Body; the Stars of natural Inclination are ſometimes obſcured by the Sun of Diſcipline and Virtue: Therefore it is good to conſider <hi>Deformity,</hi> not as a Sign which is more deceivable, but as a Cauſe which ſeldom faileth of the Effect. Whoſoever hath any thing fixed in his Perſon that doth induce Contempt, hath alſo a perpetual Spur in himſelf, to reſcue and deliver himſelf from Scorn. Therefore all <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Perſons</hi> are extreme Bold. Firſt, in their own Defence, as being expoſed to Scorn; but in Proceſs of Time, by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Habit. Alſo it ſtirreth in them In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and eſpecially of this kind, to watch and obſerve the Weakneſs of others, that they may have ſomewhat to repay. Again, in their Superiors, it quencheth Jealouſy towards them, as Perſons that they think they may at Pleaſure deſpiſe; and it layeth their Competitors and Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators aſleep, as never believing they ſhould be in a Poſſibility of Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till they ſee them in Poſſeſſion; ſo that upon the Matter, in a great Wit, <hi>Deformity</hi> is an Advantage to riſing; Kings in antient Times (and at this preſent in

But yet their Truſt towards them hath rather been as to good Spyals, and good Whiſperers, than good Magiſtrates and Officers; and much like is the Reaſon of <hi>Deformed Perſons.</hi> Still the Ground is, they will, if they be of Spirit, ſeek to free themſelves from Scorn, which muſt be either by Virtue or Malice; and therefore, let it not be marvelled, if ſometimes they prove ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſons; as was <hi>Ageſilaus, Zanger</hi> the Son of <hi>Solyman, Aeſop, Gaſca,</hi> Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Peru;</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> may go like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe amongſt them; with others.'</q>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr <hi>Pope</hi> is the Son of a Trader, and ſo is Mr <hi>Curll—par nobile.</hi>
               </note>, is of ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as juſtly to alarm every Perſon in the Nation, would not only be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable as a <hi>Curioſity,</hi> but uſeful as a <hi>Warning,</hi> and perhaps flagrant enough as an <hi>Example,</hi> to induce the LEGISLATURE to prevent for the future, an Enormity ſo prejudicial to every private Subject, and ſo deſtructive of Society itſelf.</p>
            <p>This will be made ſo plain by the enſuing Papers, that it will ſcarce be needful to attend them with any Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, more than what every Reader may make.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1727, <hi>Edmund Curll,</hi> Bookſeller, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Collection of ſeveral private Letters of Mr <hi>Pope</hi> to <hi>Henry Cromwell,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> which he obtained in this Manner.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Cromwell</hi> was acquainted with one Mrs <hi>Thomas,</hi> to whom he had the Indiſcretion to lend theſe Letters, and who falling into Misfortunes ſeven Years after, ſold them to Mr <hi>Curll,</hi> without the Conſent either of Mr <hi>Pope</hi> or Mr <hi>Cromwell</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Theſe Letters were a free Gift; ſo that there was not any Occaſion to aſk the Conſent of either of thoſe Parties. Mr <hi>Curll</hi> purchaſed them as juſtly as Mr <hi>Lintot</hi> did the Copy of Mr <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Homer,</hi> &amp;c.</note>. [See the Letters in the Preface to <hi>Vol.</hi> I.]</p>
            <p>This Treatment being extreamly diſagreeable to Mr <hi>Pope,</hi> he was adviſed to re-call any Letters which might happen to be preſerved by any of his Friends, particularly thoſe written to Perſons deceaſed, which would be moſt ſubject to ſuch an Accident. Many of theſe were returned him.</p>
            <p>Some of his Friends adviſed him to print a Collection himſelf, to prevent a worſe; but this <hi>he would by no means</hi>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0093401202:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>agree to</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">This is a notorious Falſhood, for it will be proved that the Books ſold by <hi>R.S.</hi> to Mr <hi>Curll,</hi> were printed at Mr <hi>Pope</hi>'s Expence.</note>. However, as ſome of the Letters ſerved to revive ſeveral paſt Scenes of Friendſhip, and others to clear the Truth of <hi>Facts</hi> in which he had been miſrepreſented by the common Scriblers, he was induced to preſerve a few of his own Letters, as well as of his Friends. Theſe, as I have been told, he inſerted in Two Books, ſome Originals, others Copies, with a few Notes and Extracts here and there added. In the ſame Books he cauſes to be copied ſome ſmall Pieces in Verſe and Proſe, either of his own, or his Correſpondents; which, tho' not finiſhed enough for the Public, were ſuch as the Partiality of any Friend would be ſorry to be deprived of.</p>
            <p>To this Purpoſe, an Amanuenſis or two were employed by Mr <hi>Pope,</hi> when the Books were in the Country, and by the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> when they were in Town.</p>
            <p>It happened ſoon after, that the <hi>Poſthumous Works</hi> of Mr <hi>Wycherley</hi> were publiſhed, in ſuch a Manner, as could no way increaſe the Reputation of that Gentleman, who had been Mr <hi>Pope</hi>'s firſt Correſpondent and Friend; and ſeveral of theſe Letters ſo fully ſhewed the State of that Caſe, that it was thought but a Juſtice to Mr <hi>Wycherley</hi>'s Memory to print a few, to diſcredit that Impoſition. Theſe were accordingly tranſcribed for the Preſs from the <hi>Manuſcript Books</hi> above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>They were no ſooner printed but <hi>Edmund Curll</hi> looked on theſe too as his Property; for a Copy is extant, which he corrected in order for another Impreſſion, interlin'd, and added marginal Notes to, in his own Hand<note n="*" place="bottom">This is another Falſhood, Mr <hi>Curll</hi> only gave a Copy of this Pamphlet to <hi>R.S.</hi> to ſhew <hi>P.T.</hi> that he had reprinted thoſe Letters which came out in 1728, and corrected the <hi>Errata</hi> therein.</note>.</p>
            <p>He then advertiſed a-new the Letters to Mr <hi>Cromwell,</hi> with <hi>Additions,</hi> and promis'd Encouragement to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſhould ſend him more<note n="‖" place="bottom">Falſhood the <hi>Third.</hi> Mr <hi>Curll</hi> defies any Man living to produce any ſuch Advertiſement.</note>.</p>
            <p>This is a Practice frequent with Bookſellers, to ſwell an Author's Works, in which they have ſome Property, with any Traſh that can be got from any Hand; or where they have no ſuch Works, to procure ſome. <hi>Curll</hi> has in the ſame manner ſince advertiſed the <hi>Letters</hi> of
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0093401202:20"/>
Mr <hi>Prior,</hi> and Mr <hi>Addiſon.</hi> A Practice highly deſerving ſome Check from the Legiſlature; ſince every ſuch Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, is really a <hi>Watch-word</hi> to every <hi>Scoundrel</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">None can be more a <hi>Scoundrel</hi> than the Writer of this Narrative, as the many Falſhoods detected in it will prove.</note> in the Nation, and to every <hi>Domeſtic</hi> of a Family, to get a Penny, by producing any Scrap of a Man's Writing, (of what Nature ſoever) or by picking his Maſter's Pocket of Letters and Papers.</p>
            <p>A moſt flagrant Inſtance of this kind was the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of an intended Book, called <hi>Gulliveriana Secunda;</hi> where it was promis'd, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that <hi>any Thing,</hi> which <hi>any Body</hi> ſhould ſend as Mr <hi>Pope</hi>'s, or Dr <hi>Swift</hi>'s, ſhould be printed and inſerted <hi>as Theirs.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe honeſt means, Mr <hi>Curll</hi> went on increaſing his Collection<note n="‡" place="bottom">Stupid Impertinence! what has Mr <hi>Curll</hi> to do with Dean <hi>Smedley</hi>'s Book called <hi>Gulliveriana?</hi> or with the Conduct of any other Perſon? nor was Mr <hi>Curll</hi> any ways concern'd in printing <hi>Gulliveriana.</hi>
               </note>; and finding (as will be ſeen hereafter) a farther Proſpect of doing ſo, he retarded his Edition of Mr <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Letters, till the 22d of <hi>March,</hi> 1734-5, and then ſent Mr <hi>Pope</hi> the following Letter, the firſt he ever received from him<note n="**" place="bottom">A greater Favour than Mr <hi>Pope</hi> deſerved at his Hands.</note>.</p>

            <p>Mr <hi>Pope</hi>'s Friends imagin'd that the whole Deſign of <hi>E. Curll</hi> was to get him but to look on the Edition of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Letters, and ſo to print it as <hi>revis'd</hi> by Mr <hi>Pope</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Doubtleſs that was Mr <hi>Curll</hi>'s Intent, or he need not have acquainted Mr <hi>Pope</hi> with his Deſign of printing a new Edition.</note>, in the ſame manner as he ſent an <hi>obſcene Book</hi> to a <hi>Reverend Biſhop,</hi> and then advertis'd it as <hi>corrected</hi> and <hi>revis'd</hi> by him<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </p>
                  <p>Mr <hi>Henry Hoare,</hi> eldeſt Son of Sir <hi>Richard Hoare,</hi> came to Mr <hi>Curll</hi> and told him, that Dr <hi>Robinſon,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> heard he was concern'd in printing an Edition of the Earl of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s Poems. Mr <hi>Curll</hi> told Mr <hi>Hoare,</hi> that he was, among other Bookſſellers and Printers, (<hi>viz.</hi> Mr <hi>Darby,</hi> in <hi>Bartholomew-Cloſe,</hi> Mr <hi>Betteſworth,</hi> in <hi>Pater-noſter-row,</hi> Mr <hi>Rivington,</hi> in <hi>St Paul's Church-yard,</hi> Mr <hi>Pemberton,</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> &amp;c.) concerned in an Edition of that Nobleman's Works. But likewiſe told Mr <hi>Hoare,</hi> that he would get a Book interleav'd for my Lord Biſhop, and whatever his Lordſhip ſaw amiſs, if he would be pleaſed to ſtrike out any Lines, or Poems therein, ſuch Leaves ſhould be re-printed, and render'd conformable to his Lordſhip's Opinion. Away goes Mr <hi>Hoare,</hi> overjoy'd with this Meſſage from Mr <hi>Curll,</hi> with a tender of his Duty to the Biſhop, and opens his Credentials; upon hearing which the Biſhop ſmil'd, and made the following Reply to Mr <hi>Hoare.</hi> Sir, I am told that Mr <hi>Curll</hi> is a ſhrewd Man, and ſhould I reviſe the Book you have brought me, he would publiſh it as approv'd by me. This no doubt Mr <hi>Curll</hi> might juſtly have done, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not condemn'd is approv'd; a Standing-Maxim This, in Civil, Canon, and Common Law.</p>
               </note>. Or if there was any ſuch Propoſal from

               <hi>P.T. Curll</hi> would not fail to embrace it, perhaps pay for the Copy with the very Money he might draw from Mr <hi>P—</hi> to ſuppreſs it, and ſay <hi>P.T.</hi> had kept another Copy. He therefore anſwer'd the only way he thought it ſafe to correſpond with him, by a public Advertiſement in the <hi>Daily Poſt-Boy</hi> [<hi>Daily Journal,</hi> and <hi>Grub-ſtreet Journal</hi>].</p>
            <p>
               <hi>E. Curll</hi> return'd an impertinent Anſwer<note n="‖" place="bottom">It was univerſally allow'd to be a very pertinent one.</note> in the ſame Paper the next Day, denying that he <hi>endeavour'd to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with Mr</hi> P. and affirming that he wrote by <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but declaring that he would <hi>inſtantly print the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</hi> In a few Days more he publiſh'd the <hi>Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Book</hi> as above, with this Addition, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>E.C.</hi> as before in the like Caſe, will be faithful."</q>
            </p>
            <p>He now talk'd of it every where, ſaid <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That <hi>P.T.</hi> was a LORD<note n="‡" place="bottom">This is falſe: <hi>E.P.</hi> is a Nobleman, <hi>P.T.</hi> is a Scrub.</note>, or a PERSON of CONSEQUENCE, who printed the Book at a <hi>great Expence,</hi> and ſought no Profit, but <hi>Revenge</hi> on Mr <hi>Pope, who had offended him:</hi>"</q> particularly, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That ſome of the Letters would be ſuch as both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State would take Notice of;</hi> but that <hi>P.T.</hi> would by no means be known in it, that he never would once be <hi>ſeen</hi> by him, but treated in a very <hi>ſecret Manner.</hi>"</q> He told ſome Perſons that ſifted him in this Affair, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That he had convers'd only with his Agent, a Clergyman of the Name of <hi>Smith,</hi> who came, as he ſaid, from <hi>Southwark.</hi>"</q> With this Perſon it was that <hi>Curll</hi> tranſacted the Affair, who before all the Letters of the Book were deliver'd to <hi>Curll,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on the Letters of <hi>P.T.</hi> being return'd him, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him from all poſſibility of a Diſcovery, as appears from a following Letter.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Pope,</hi> on hearing of this <hi>Smith,</hi> and finding when the Book came out, that ſeveral of the Letters could only have come from the <hi>Manuſcript Book</hi> before-mentioned, publiſh'd this Advertiſement.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">WHEREAS a Perſon who ſigns himſelf <hi>P.T.</hi> and another who writes himſelf <hi>R. Smith,</hi> and paſſes for a Clergyman, have tranſacted for ſome time paſt with

            </p>
            <p>Whether this Advertiſement, or the future Quarrel of <hi>Curll</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> about Profits produced what followed, we cannot ſay, but in a few Days the enſuing Papers, being the whole<note n="†" place="bottom">Falſe.

                  <p>I Have not ever met with any thing more inconſiſtent than the ſeveral Propoſals of your Letters.

                  <p>The ſecond of your Letters of <hi>Nov.</hi> 15th, 1733, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me, That if I would publiſh an Advertiſement of a Collection of Mr <hi>Pope</hi>'s Letters in your Cuſtody, the Originals ſhould be forthwith ſent me, and for which you would expect no more than what would pay for a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of 'em.</p>

                     <p>IN purſuance to your Advertiſement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring ſuch Accounts of Mr <hi>Pope as his Deſerts demand,</hi> I ſend you theſe <hi>Anecdotes,</hi> the Truth of which I can teſtify (and will, if called upon) as having been his School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow my ſelf at the time.</p>
                     <p>The fact is very remarkable, as it is a proof of that <hi>natural ſpleen</hi> which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes his <hi>Temperament,</hi> and from which he has never deviated in the whole courſe of his Life.</p>
                     <p>The laſt School he was put to, before the twelfth Year of his Age, was in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire-Street</hi> near <hi>Bloomſbury,</hi> there I alſo was, and the late Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> at the ſame time. It was kept by one <hi>Bromley,</hi> a <hi>Popiſh Renegado,</hi> who had been a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and was one of <hi>King James's</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts in <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſome Years after that Prince's Abdication; <note n="*" place="bottom">His Name was <hi>William Bromley,</hi> Son of <hi>Henry Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> of <hi>Holt</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> 
                           <abbr>Eſq</abbr> He was entered a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-Commoner of Chriſt-Church-College, <hi>Oxon,</hi> 1673. See <hi>Wood's Athen. Oxon.</hi> p. 1063. Vol. II. Edit. ult.</note> he kept <hi>a little Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> till upon an advantagious offer made
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0093401202:39"/>
him, he went a <hi>Travelling-Tutor</hi> to the preſent Lord <hi>Gage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr <hi>Alexander Pope</hi> before he had been four Months at this School (or was able to conſtrue <hi>Tully's Offices</hi>) employed his Muſe in ſatirizing his Maſter. It was a Libel of at leaſt one hundred Verſes, which a Fellow-Student having given information of, was found in his pocket, and the young Satiriſt was ſoundly whipp'd, and kept a Priſoner to his Room ſeven days; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Father fetch'd him away, and I have been told, he never went to School more.</p>
                     <p>How much <hi>paſt Correction</hi> has wrought upon him, the World is Judge; and how much <hi>preſent</hi> Correction might, may be collected from this ſample. I thought it a curious Fact, and therefore it is at your ſervice, as one of the Ornaments of this excellent Perſon's Life.</p>

                     <p>I was well acquainted with his Father, and with the firſt part of his own Life, tho' ſince he hath treated me as a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>It is certain ſome late Pamphlets are not fair in reſpect to his Father. He was of the younger Branch of a Family in good repute in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and related to the Lord <hi>Downe,</hi> formerly of the ſame Name. He was as he hath told Me himſelf, [and he was very different from his Son, a modeſt and plain honeſt Man] a Poſthumous Son, and left little provided for, his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having what ſmall Eſtate there was, who afterwards ſtudied and died at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> He was put to a Merchant in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and acquired a moderate Fortune by Merchandize, which he quitted, at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, in very good Circumſtances, and retired to <hi>Windſor-Foreſt,</hi> where he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a ſmall Eſtate, and took great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0093401202:41"/>
in Huſbandry and Gardens. His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was one of the ſeventeen Children of <hi>William Turnor,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> formerly of <hi>Burfit-Hall</hi> in the *** Riding of <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> Two of her Brothers were killed in the Civil-Wars.</p>
                     <p>This is a true Account of Mr <hi>Pope</hi>'s Family and Parentage; <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Oxford</hi> Antiquary informs us, that, <hi>Thomas Pope,</hi> the young Earl of <hi>Downe,</hi> died in St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Pariſh in <hi>Oxford,</hi> 28 <hi>Dec.</hi> 1660, aged 38 Years leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind him one only Daughter named <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was firſt married to <hi>Henry-Francis Lee</hi> of <hi>Dich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Lindſey.</hi> The Earldom of <hi>Downe,</hi> went to <hi>Thomas Pope,</hi> 
                           <abbr>Eſq</abbr> his Uncle, who, likewiſe, leaving no Male-Iſſue, the Eſtate went away among <hi>Three</hi> Daughters; the <hi>Second</hi> of whom was married to Sir <hi>Francis North,</hi> afterwards Lord <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Guilford.</hi> Both theſe Earls of <hi>Downe</hi> were buried at <hi>Wroxton,</hi> near <hi>Banbury,</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> with their Anceſtors.

                     <p>
                        <hi>A propos,</hi> to his Life, there have lately fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into my hands a large Collection of his Letters, from the former part of his Days till the Year 1727, which being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than any yet ſeen, and opening very many Scenes new to the World, will alone make a perfect and the moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic Life and Memoirs of him that could be.</p>

I will give you an Advertiſement which you may publiſh, if you pleaſe, forthwith; and, on your ſo doing, the Letters ſhall be ſent you. They will make a four of five Shilling Book; yet I expect no more than what will barely pay a Tranſcriber, that the Originals may be preſerved in mine, or your Hands, to vouch the Truth of them.</p>
                     <p>I am of opinion theſe alone will contain his whole Hiſtory (if you add to them, what you formerly printed of thoſe to <hi>H. Cromwell,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr>); but you muſt put out an <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> for otherwiſe I ſhall not be juſtified, to ſome people who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and on whom I have ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance; unleſs it ſeem to the public Eye as no entire Act of mine. But I may be juſtified and excuſed, if, after they ſee ſuch a Collection is made by you, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I ſent ſome Letters to contribute thereto.</p>

The old Gentleman, P.T. not calling upon me, I did not put the <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> into any News-Paper, and this whole Tranſaction lay dormant near two Years. But upon regulating ſome Papers in my Scritoire, about the Cloſe of <hi>March</hi> 1735, this <hi>Advertiſement</hi> came to my Hands, and reflecting within my ſelf that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment between Mr <hi>Pope</hi> and me, tho' from the firſt ungenerouſly taken up by him, had continued much too long, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt eight Years, I was willing to lay hold of an Opportunity for propoſing an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. Accordingly, I wrote to Mr <hi>Pope</hi> and incloſed the abovementioned <hi>Advertiſement</hi> in the Hand-writing of P.T. and deſired his Anſwer which he thought fit in a very ungentleman-like Manner to return me in three Papers, viz the <hi>Grub-Street Journal.</hi> The <hi>Daily Journal,</hi> and the <hi>Daily Poſt-Boy;</hi> in the laſt of which I replied <hi>April</hi> 5th.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the <hi>Appendix</hi> No. I. and II.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this Incident, P.T. renewed his Correſpondence, and ſent me word he had ſeen an <hi>Advertiſement</hi> of Mr <hi>Pope</hi> which related to him, and that Mr <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould ſoon ſee the <hi>Collection of Letters</hi> publiſhed, for that, upon my <hi>not advertiſing them</hi> he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0093401202:45"/>
had been perſuaded to print them himſelf, and offered me the refuſal of the Impreſſion, his Demands for which were 75 pounds, and added, that a Perſon ſhould meet me at the Roſe Tavern in <hi>Bridges-Street,</hi> and bring me, at a Day appointed, one of the Books in ſheets. But on the Day appointed I received a Countermand, that he thought he had loſt his Wits by making ſuch an Appointment, and ſeemed in a terrible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic leſt Mr <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould ſend ſome of his <hi>Twickenham-Bravoes,</hi> to aſſault us; but how Mr <hi>Pope</hi> was to know of this Meeting is the Cream of the Jeſt. I ſent him word that I commiſerated his fears, but as to my own part, I did not at all dread any <hi>Aſſaſſination</hi> whatever from Mr <hi>Pope,</hi> even tho' it were a <hi>Poetical One.</hi> To this P.T. rejoined, that a Gentleman ſhould call at my Houſe preciſely at eight in the Evening in a Week's Time; but in the Interim I received the following Letter, <hi>viz.</hi>

According to the Requeſt herein, I ſtaid at home; and, about one o'Clock, <hi>R.S.</hi> ſent for me to the <hi>Standard Tavern</hi> in <hi>Leiceſter-Fields,</hi> where I paid him ten pounds, and gave him a negotiable Note for fifteen pounds, payable in a Month, as he deſired.</p>
               <p>We had not been together half an hour, before two Porters brought to the Tavern five Bundles of Books upon a Horſe, which R.S. told me came by Water. He ordered the Porters to carry them to my Houſe and my Wife took them in. They contained but 38 Books in each bundle making in the 5 Bundles 190 Books (all wanting the Letters to Meſſ. <hi>Jarvas, Digby, Blount</hi> and Dr <hi>Arbuthnot</hi>'s Letter). But he ſaid they contained 50 in each Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which with 50 I had before (without Titles or Prefaces,) made 300, and gave me the following Receipts.</p>

               <p>About two a Clock, on the very Day of Publication, the 12th Inſtant, all the Books that were in my Cuſtody were ſeized by a Warrant from the Houſe of Lords, and my ſelf, and Mr <hi>John Wilford,</hi> Publiſher of the Poſt-Boy, were both ordered to attend their Lordſhips, the next Day; which we did accordingly.

                     <p>AS SOON as I heard of our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Books being ſeiz'd, I poſted away to P.T. he ſaid he found his great Caution was but neceſſary: but tho' he knew Mr <hi>Pope</hi>'s Intereſt with the Great, he apprehended only his perſonal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or a Chancery Suit; (knowing he would ſpare no Coſt to gratify his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0093401202:52"/>
he ſaid, if you had been more cautious, than to <hi>name Lords</hi> in your Advertiſement, this could not have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd; but ſince it has happen'd, you ſhall not only find him punctual, but <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi> He immediately ſent me with Money to pay off the Printer, and I have the whole Impreſſion in my hands: I then found that the Rogue had deliver'd your laſt Parcel imperfect: but I will bring you both thoſe Sheets, and the whole Impreſſion, the very firſt day they can be ſafely deliver'd you.</p>
                     <p>P.T. ſays he never intended any more Advantage, but meerly not to be out of pocket. (Except you had been willing to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify me a little), but now he will be Juſt, and act handſomely to you, tho' ever ſo much to his own Loſs: provided you keep ſecret our whole Tranſaction—As it is plain that <hi>Pope</hi>'s whole Point is only to <hi>ſuppreſs the Books,</hi> and find out <hi>who gave the Letters.</hi> You will intirely diſappoint him in both, if, whatever Queſtions the Lords aſk, you will anſwer no more than thus: <hi>that you had the Letters</hi> from <hi>different Hands,</hi> ſome of which you <hi>paid</hi> for, that <hi>you printed theſe as you did Mr Cromwell's</hi> before, without Mr <hi>Pope</hi>'s ever <hi>gainſaying</hi> it; and that as to the <hi>Originals, many you can</hi>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0093401202:53"/>
                        <hi>ſhew now,</hi> and the reſt you can <hi>very ſpeedily.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is well that an Accident hinders you at preſent from the Originals, which now, they would ſeize. P.T. thinks it was indiſcreet to advertiſe the Originals ſo very quick as the firſt Day, until you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually had them, which by his own fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ill, he cou'd not come at ſo ſoon in the place where they lay.</p>
                     <p>The Lords cannot ſtop the Books above two or three Days, if at all.</p>
                     <p>And P.T's wonderful Caution as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, will enable you to ſell them what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Orders they may make. For he, apprehending Injunctions in Chancery might ſuppreſs the Book, had already prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>another Title and Preface,</hi> which throws the Publication intirely off you, and might be ſafely vended even in that Caſe.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, if you abſolutely conceal all that has paſſed between P.T. Me, and Your ſelf, you win the old Gentleman for ever. For his whole Heart is ſet upon publiſhing the Letters, not ſo much for this Volume as, <hi>in Ordine ad</hi> to much more important Correſpondence that will follow, <hi>viz.</hi> with SWIFT, late Lord OX....D Bp. ROCHESTER, and Lord BOL.</p>

                     <p>WE heartily congratulate you on your Victory over the Lords, the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Devil: for we have ſure Information, that the Books will be reſtor'd to you either this day, or to morrow—The old Gentleman is charm'd with your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour yeſterday; only thinks it wrong that he hears you own'd the <hi>Books were ſent to your Wife</hi> by an unknown Hand.—This may induce Enquiry and Suſpicion of ſome dark Tranſaction; and be thought ſhuffling. The Lords will think you more ſincere, and 'twill have a betrer Air, to ſay, <hi>you had the Originals and Copies from different Hands, and that ſome you paid for, ſome were given you, and you printed them in your own Right.</hi>—You can ſuffer no more for printing than for publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0093401202:55"/>
them, and the Lords can't touch a Hair of your Head.</p>
                     <p>All that <hi>P.T.</hi> can apprehend is that <hi>Pope</hi> may obtain an Injunction in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, againſt <hi>E. Curll</hi> by Name, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, thoſe Books may be ſelling, which have not your Name, with the Preface which he provided for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>And you cannot but obſerve when you read that Preface, that at the ſame Time, that it makes you not Publiſher, it yet proves your Right to <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s <hi>Letters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is as lucky as can be, and <hi>Pope</hi> cannot obtain an Injunction without own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, in the Bill, Author of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which will ſerve you to prove the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters genuine.</p>
                     <p>If you obſerve all the old Gentleman's Directions you will ſoon be fully acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both with his Perſon and Deſigns; in the mean Time, to ſhew you he will take off the Maſk, and clear the <hi>Myſterium magnum</hi> you complain of, I have his Leave to tell you theſe things which he would have, writ to you himſelf, but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0093401202:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that his Arm is now diſabled by the Rheumatiſm.</p>
                     <p>He is no Man of Quality, but converſant with many, and happening to be concern'd with a noble Lord (a Friend of Mr <hi>Pope</hi>'s) in handing to the Preſs his Letters to <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherley,</hi> he got ſome Copies over and above. This Incident put firſt into his Head the Thought of collecting more, and afterwards finding you did not comply in printing his Advertiſement, he went on with it by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Found <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Anſwers in the ſame Lord's Poſſeſſion, with many others, which he printed as near as poſſible to correſpond with the Letter and Paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Obſervations he made in ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraphs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were neceſſary, the ſame things being repeated in other Letters, either of this or the next Volume, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Original of the Letter to Mr <hi>Walſh</hi> is in his Hand.</p>
                     <p>I hope to have ſome of his Originals when we meet. The Books that Raſcal ſent imperfect, you ſhall have perfected on your firſt Deſire by a Line to <hi>Dicks;</hi> in which you are diſir'd to ſend us Word of what you now think of the Honour and Candour of</p>

him. He ſays you did not follow the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions he ſent you, in not owning the Printing; which tho' in your Letter you ſeem to think nothing, yet joyn'd to your having own'd to others, that you had them from a-croſs the Water, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all that you could diſcover. Yet further, we are certainly inform'd that you have nam'd me as the Hand that convey'd them. This you've ſaid, that I was a Clergyman belonging to <hi>C. Church</hi> in <hi>Southwark.</hi> Judge you whether we can think of you as you've Reaſon to think of us, whether this be honourable Uſage, after you had known what <hi>P.T.</hi> had done, and what a Sum he paid to get you the whole Impreſſion. <hi>P.T.</hi> had Reaſon to think you would betray him aſſoon as you had it. Judge too if you have done wiſely, to hazard, by your blabbing, the Loſs of a future Copy of immenſe Value, which I much doubt he will ever let you have. He has poſitively enjoyn'd me not to truſt my ſelf with you till better Aſſurance: and the beſt way for my Part that I know you can give any Aſſurance is, to ſend the 20 pound firſt, to <hi>Dicks Coffee-Houſe,</hi> in a Note on Mr <hi>Hoare,</hi> by 10 to-morrow morning; and to ſhow P.T. that you truſt him as abſolutely in that ſmall Sum, as he has

done you in a much greater. As ſoon as you do this (and not before) he'll ſend all the things you deſire, which I believe he would never have done after your naming me, and coming ſo near, as <hi>Southwark,</hi> but for his being ſo earneſt to have the Book publiſh'd.</p>
                     <p>In one Word he has put it upon this Teſt.</p>

               <p>ABOUT the Time that Mr <hi>Wycherley</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> I troubled you with a Letter of mine, in hopes of prevailing with you to continue, the Favour of your's. But I now write, to convince you that Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is not always the ſureſt Guard againſt Impertinence: I have too great a Senſe of thoſe many Civilities receiv'd from you, to deſiſt from expreſſing it, till I receive more: For you not only have acquainted me with many of my Errors in ſcribbling, but with ſome in my Conduct; and I owe to you the Knowledge of Things infinitely more of Concern to myſelf, than any thing of mine can be to others. The Advantage I have obtain'd from both might endanger your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put upon an endleſs Trouble of criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cizing on the reſt of my Faults, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have reaſon to make ſome delay with thoſe now under your Examination. Tho' I never cou'd expect you ſhou'd once look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but when you were perfectly at Leiſure; yet ſo much Aſſurance your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Kindneſs had given me, that I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome Apprehenſions for your Health, on

And I had certainly been there before this Time, had it been in my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to comply with his moſt obliging Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and my Deſires of ſeeing him and you. But ſince I find I muſt not hope for that Satisfaction till after <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you will not, in the mean time, let me be ſo unhappy as to doubt of your Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; which is the ſole Buſineſs of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that (to make you ſome amends for the unconſcionable Length of my laſt) ſhall not add a Word more but that which I hope you will ever believe, that I am,</p>

your Diſpute with the Senate of <hi>Venice.</hi> I had the pleaſure to day of hearing your Lordſhip's Conduct in this Affair very much applauded by ſome of our firſt Peers.

However, as he is very well convinced that the Government intirely diſapproves ſuch a Proceeding, there are no ill Conſequences apprehended from it. Your Lordſhip knows that the Privileges of Ambaſſadors are under very little Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in <hi>England,</hi> and I believe that a Bill will be promoted in the next Parliament for ſetting them upon a certain foot; at leaſt it is what we talk of in both Offices on this Occaſion.</p>

                  <p>At the entrance of the Hall was a Glaſs Room, which I took to be the Porter's Lodge, and admired the Contrivance, but was preſently convinced of my Miſtake, when raiſed by Pullies to the Roof, I
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0093401202:124"/>
diſcovered it to be a moſt ſtupendious Lanthorn.</p>
                  <p>We advanced to the Stair-caſe, where a Market-Place was deſcribed, with Slaves ſetting upon Benches to the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>left,</hi> to be BOUGHT and SOLD, <hi>Trimalchio</hi> hard by with a Whip and Bridle; a little farther was repreſented how he firſt learnt to ſpell, and beyond that was <hi>Mercury</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him up by the Chin and placing him on a Throne; <hi>Fortune</hi> preſented him with a <hi>Cornucopia</hi> and the <hi>three fatal Siſters,</hi> ſpun a Thread of Gold. He was in different places painted as a Judge, a General, and a Prieſt; the whole was excellently performed, and highly finiſhed: ſurfeited with this fulſom Pageantry, as we proceeded, a Slave, ſtript of his Livery, caſt himſelf at our feet, imploring our Protection, proteſting his Fault was Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency only, that being rouſed from ſleep, and aſked a queſtion he knew nothing of, he had ſaid NO when he ſhould have ſaid YES. We were ſaluted by him in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Room with thanks for the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he told us was well beſtowed, for, ſays he, the Wine, my Lord drinks, you ſhall anon find to be in the diſpoſal of his Servants; having viewed the Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, the huge Piles of maſſy Plate, and ſpacious Ciſterns, double gilt, on which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0093401202:125"/>
                     <hi>Trimalchio</hi>'s Arms and Name were engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and it's weight markt on each peice, we all ſeated ourſelves, except <hi>Trimalchio,</hi> for whom the chief Place was reſerved. At the ſtriking up of a Band of Muſic he made his Entrance, <hi>My Friends,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have buſineſs to diſpatch, but came thus ſoon, leſt my Abſence ſhould make you uneaſy.</hi> Now the Servants entered ſweating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ponderous Diſhes, which they ſeemed hardly able to ſupport; the fleſh of Bulls, Calves, Sheep, Deer, and other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds; all Kinds of Fiſh and Fowl, were ſtewed for the Juices they contained, which, blended into one Fluid, formed a moſt delicious Soup. Near, in a golden Charger were an hundred mangled Vipers, buried in their own blood; in other Diſhes were the Palates of <hi>Cuckows,</hi> the Rumps of <hi>Wheat-Ears,</hi> the Brains of <hi>Nightingales,</hi> Cavear of <hi>Todpoles,</hi> an <hi>Onocrotalon,</hi> the Hump of a <hi>Camel,</hi> the Proboſcis of an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> and a <hi>Sow</hi>'s Paps. I knew not a ſeventh part of this Courſe; the greateſt ſhare of which was ſcrambled away before it could be diſtinctly viewed; a Slave in the Hurry threw down a golden Diſh, and ſtooping to take it up, <hi>Trimalchio</hi> gave him a ſound Box on the Ear, and ordered it to be ſwept out of the Room; the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers rang, and Wine went briſkly round,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0093401202:126"/>
when, every body ſaid ſomething in praiſe of this Service, this Applauſe was followed with a ſecond, and that indifferent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Place, the Novelty of it however drew our Attention, it was a round Table on which were placed the <hi>twelve Signs</hi> in their proper Order, upon each of which the Diſpoſer had put ſome thing ſuitable. Upon ARIES was a <hi>Sheep's-Head;</hi> upon TAURUS, a <hi>Chine</hi> of <hi>Beef;</hi> upon GEMINI, <hi>Lamb's-Stones</hi> and <hi>Kidneys;</hi> upon CANCER, a <hi>Ducal-Coronet;</hi> upon LEO, the <hi>African-Fruit;</hi> upon VIRGO, <hi>Sauſages;</hi> upon LIBRA, a <hi>Pair of Scales,</hi> in the <hi>one</hi> a <hi>Pudding,</hi> in the <hi>other</hi> a Panegyric; upon SCORPIO, a <hi>Sprat;</hi> upon SAGITTARIUS, a <hi>Hare;</hi> upon CAPRICORN, a <hi>Lobſter;</hi> upon AQUARIUS, a <hi>Gooſe;</hi> upon PISCES, two <hi>Mullets;</hi> and in the middle, a Plate of <hi>ſweet Herbs.</hi> Now <hi>Trimalchio,</hi> intreated us to be merry, called for more Wine, and larger Glaſſes, the Company were highly elevated, ſeveral Courſes followed too nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous and tedious to relate. I aſked one of the Gueſts who that <hi>Woman</hi> was, that ſcutled up and down the Room, her Name is FORTUNATA, ſays he, ſhe is the Wife of <hi>Trimalchio,</hi> ſhe meaſures her Money by the Buſhel; and yet ſhe ſprang from a Dunghil not long ſince, no Man would have touched her with a Pair of Tongs;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0093401202:127"/>
now ſhe is his Heaven, his <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all!</hi> what ſhe ſays muſt be truth, ſhe's a <hi>Wagtail,</hi> a meer <hi>Shrew,</hi> a <hi>Magpye,</hi> whom ſhe loves, ſhe loves; and whom ſhe loves <hi>not,</hi> ſhe hates. <hi>Trimalchio</hi> knows not half his Income, nor extent of his Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sun,</hi> himſelf, ſurveys it not at once, but travels for the view; a <hi>Crow</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fly over it in a Week; he buys no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet owns the whole Town, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits it all, and is himſelf the People. A twentieth part of his Tenants don't know their Landlord; there are <hi>Thirty</hi> Degrees amongſt his Servants; he has <hi>twenty-ſix</hi> Domeſtic-Chaplains, and <hi>three Orders</hi> of his Favourites, whom he teaches to jump over a Stick; he is himſelf a Lover of Peace; for when the <hi>Alemains</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> were at war, he ſent and deſired to be Friends.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, another <hi>Orator</hi> aroſe and thus delivered himſelf. The World, the whole World, cannot be ignorant of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of our Patron CAIUS. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Provinces, the high Truſts and principal Employments of <hi>Rome,</hi> are not beſtowed by Favour but Merit, nothing is now conſidered but Integrity and Worth. What good Work is left undone? The luminous Dignitaries of the Church, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Charges of the War, the Trade and flouriſhing Opulency of the People, the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0093401202:128"/>
increaſing Glory and Grandeur of the State! Theſe our <hi>Romans</hi> ſhall record to Perpetuity, the Honours of <hi>Trimalchio,</hi> which conſiſt not in his many eminent and great Employments, but in his tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Liberality, profound Policy, and the ardent and unextinguiſhed Love he bears his Country, in whoſe uncorrupt hands we are as Counters, and what juſt now ſtood for Millions ſhall at his pleaſure dwindle to Cyphers. We had now got our full Doſe, and were grown ſick of this fulſom Slave; when <hi>Trimalchio</hi> leaning on his Elbow thus ſpoke—<hi>This Wine,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is good; and Fiſh ſhould ſwim: let's be merry, and exerciſe our Lungs as well as Teeth. Well,</hi> Peace be with my Maſter's bones, <hi>ſay I, who made a Man of me. You can tell me nothing which I don't know, I never was outwitted; for, I am a thorough Maſter of the Practicks!</hi> Here he explained the <hi>Heavens</hi> by <hi>Banquets,</hi> and ſhewed us the Influence of each <hi>Sign</hi> upon our Nativity. Clapping our Hands and hollooing we rang an univerſal Peal to his Applauſe, and ſwore all the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers</hi> in the World were Fools to him; upon this, he called for his Will, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it to be read, this ſet the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in Tears, and their howling was as grievous, as their Joy before had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive;

he repeated his Epitaph himſelf, which he aſſured us was of his own compoſing; no doubt, ſays he, you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how I became ſo Great! conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Age, for theſe Teeth I loſt, when I was a Boy, and I have proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ever ſince.

This <hi>Trimalchio,</hi> ſays he, is a pitiful Scoundrel, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Pack of Raſcals, he became the mighty deſpicable thing he is, by Fawning, Wriggling, Whiſpering, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing, Bargaining, and Backbiting; no honeſt Man can Eat, Drink, Sleep, or enjoy the Light of the Sun without paying an EXCISE for the ſupport of his Luxury: as if the Gifts of Providence were at his ſole Diſpoſal.

                  <salute>Dear SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU will wonder to ſee me in Print; but how could I avoid it? The Dead and the Living, my Friends and my Foes, at home and abroad, call upon me to ſay ſomething; and the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Hiſtory, which I, and all the World value, muſt have ſuffered, had I continued ſilent. I have printed <hi>here,</hi> in hopes that ſomebody afterward may venture to reprint in <hi>England,</hi> notwithſtanding thoſe two frightening Words at the Cloſe of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">His Name.</note>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0093401202:160"/>
Whether that happens or not, it is fit you ſhould have a Sight of it, who I know will read it with ſome degree of Satisfaction, as it is mine, tho' it ſhould have (as it really has) nothing elſe to recommend it. Such as it is, <hi>Extremum hoc munus morientis habeto;</hi> For that may well be the Caſe, conſidering that within a few Months I am entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Seventieth Year; after which, even the Healthy and the Happy cannot much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Life, and will not, if they are wiſe, much deſire it. Whenever I go, you will loſe a Friend, who loves and values you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, if in my Circumſtances I can be ſaid to be loſt to any one, when dead, more than I am already whilſt living. I expected to have heard from you by Mr. <hi>Morice,</hi> and wondered a little that I did not; but he owns himſelf in a Fault, for not giving you due Notice of his Motions. It was not amiſs that you forbore writing to me on a Head, wherein I promis'd more than I was able to perform. Diſgraced Men fancy ſometimes, that they preſerve an Influence, where, when they endeavour to exert it, they ſoon ſee their Miſtake. I did ſo, my good Friend, and acknowledge it under my Hand. You ſounded the Coaſt and found out my Error, it ſeems, before I was aware of it; but enough on this Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0093401202:161"/>
What are you doing in <hi>England</hi> to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Letters? and particularly what are you doing? <hi>Ipſe quid audes? Quae circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volitas agilis Thyma?</hi> Do you purſue the moral Plan<note n="*" place="bottom">The Eſſay on Man.</note> you marked out, and ſeemed ſixteen Months ago ſo intent upon? Am I to ſee it perfected ere I die? And are you to enjoy the Reputation of it while you live? Or do you rather chuſe to leave the Marks of your Friendſhip, like the Legacies of a Will, to be read and enjoy'd only by thoſe who ſurvive you? Were I as near you as I have been, I ſhould hope to peep into the Manuſcript before it was finiſhed. But alas! there is and will ever probably be, a great deal of Land and Sea between us. How many Books have come out of late in your Parts, which you think I ſhould be glad to peruſe? Name them: the Catalogue, I believe, will not coſt you much Trouble. They muſt be good ones indeed to challenge any Part of my Time, now I have ſo little of it left. I, who ſquandred whole Days heretofore, now huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Hours, when the Glaſs begins to run low, and care not to miſ-ſpend them on Trifles. At the End of the Lottery of Life, our laſt Minutes, like Tickets left in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0093401202:162"/>
Wheel, riſe in their Valuation. They are not of ſo much worth, perhaps, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as thoſe which preceded, but we are apt to prize them more, and with Reaſon. I do ſo, my dear Friend, and yet think the moſt precious Minutes of my Life are well employ'd, in reading what you write. But this is a Satisfaction I cannot much hope for, and therefore muſt betake myſelf to others, <hi>which</hi> are leſs entertaining. Adieu, Dear Sir, and forgive me engaging with one, whom you, I think, have reckoned among the Heroes of the <hi>Dunciad.</hi> It was neceſſary for me either to accept of his dirty Challenge, or to have ſuffer'd in the Eſteem of the World by declining it. My Reſpects to your Mother; I ſend a Paper for Dean <hi>Swift,</hi> if you have an Opportunity, and think it worth your while to convey it. My Country at this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſeems to me a ſtrange Sight, I know not how it appears to you, who are in the midſt of the Scene, and yourſelf a Part of it; I wiſh you would tell me. You may write ſafely to Mr. <hi>Morice,</hi> by the honeſt Hand that conveys this, and will return into theſe Parts before <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> ſketch out a rough Draught of it, that I may be able to judge, whether a Return to it be really eligible, or whether I ſhould not, like the Chymiſt in the Bottle, upon hearing Don <hi>Quevedo</hi>'s Account
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0093401202:163"/>
of <hi>Spain,</hi> deſire to be corked up again. After all, I do and muſt love my Country, with all its Faults and Blemiſhes; even that Part of the Conſtitution, which wounded me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, and itſelf thro' my Side, ſhall ever be dear to me. My laſt Wiſh will be like that of Father <hi>Paul, Eſto perpetua;</hi> and when I die at a Diſtance from it, it will be in the ſame manner as <hi>Virgil</hi> deſcribes the expiring <hi>Peloponneſian,</hi>

               <p>Being called upon in this public Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I myſelf obliged to declare, that the foregoing Account, in all its Parts, as far as I am any ways concerned, is entirely
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0093401202:171"/>
falſe and groundleſs; for I never ſaw my Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s Hiſtory in Manuſcript, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, or ſince the Edition of it; nor ever read a Line of it, but in Print. It was impoſſible, therefore, that I ſhould deal with Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in the Manner repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, with whom (as far as I can recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) I never exchanged one Word in all my Life; and whom I know not that I ever ſaw, till after the Edition of that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. If therefore he expreſſed himſelf to this Purpoſe, in his laſt Moments (as I charitably hope he did not) he wronged me extremely, and died with a Lie in his Mouth.</p>
               <p>This Vindication of the Truth and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is neceſſary, ſince I happen to ſurvive the two other worthy Perſons mentioned. Were they alive, they would, I doubt not, be equally able and ready to clear themſelves from ſo foul an Aſperſion. As to one of them, Dr. <hi>Smallridge,</hi> the late Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> no Suſpicion of this kind can poſſibly reſt on his Memory, becauſe he was not any ways concerned in preparing that Hiſtory for the Preſs; but as much a Stranger to the Contents of it, as I myſelf was, till it came forth in Print. I ſpeak with the more Aſſurance on this Head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my great Intimacy with him, as my Contemporary, both at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> gave me all the Advantages
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0093401202:172"/>
requiſite towards knowing the Truth of what I ſay: With Dr. <hi>Aldrich,</hi> the third Perſon accuſed, I was acquainted more at a diſtance: However, being called upon in the Manner I am, I will add alſo what has come to my Knowledge, with regard to the Share He and Others had in the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The Reviſing of the Manuſcript (writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as I have heard, not very correctly) was committed to the Care of Biſhop <hi>Sprat,</hi> and Dean <hi>Aldrich,</hi> by the late Earl of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> who himſelf alſo aſſiſted in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſal, from the Beginning to the End of the Work: So that any Changes, made in it, muſt have had the Conſent of thoſe three Perſons. They were Men of Probity and Truth, and incapable of conſpiring in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to impoſe on the Publick. I can cite nothing, that is material in this Point, from the Mouth of the <hi>Earl,</hi> with whom I rarely converſed; but the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and the <hi>Dean,</hi> to whom I ſeverally ſucceeded in the Deaneries of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> and in the See of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> have occaſionally more than once aſſured me, that no Additions whatſoever were made to the Manuſcript Hiſtory: And even the <hi>Earl,</hi> in his Preface to the firſt Volume (for His I take it to be, tho' no Name is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to it) has publickly proteſted his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0093401202:173"/>
in this reſpect, where he declares, that <hi>They who put forth the Hiſtory</hi> (he means himſelf and his Brother, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what follows) <hi>durſt not take upon them to make any Alterations in a Work of this Kind, ſolemnly left with them to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, whenever it ſhould be publiſhed, as it was delivered to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Could he, and the two other Perſons by him employed, be ſuppoſed to have made any Additions, notwithſtanding ſuch Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances to the contrary, yet their good Senſe (if not their Integrity) would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, at leaſt, their re-touching thoſe <hi>Characters,</hi> which are allowed to be the moſt diſtinguiſhed and beautiful Part of the Work, and to have ſomething of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal in them, that is not to be imitated. The After-ſtrokes of any leſs able Pencil, intermix'd with thoſe of the firſt Maſterly Hand, would ſoon be diſcovered: And yet I am perſuaded, the moſt diſcerning Eye can find out no Traces of ſuch a Mixture; no, not in the Character of Mr. <hi>Hampden,</hi> even in thoſe Words, at the Cloſe of it, againſt which Mr. <hi>Oldmixon</hi> ſo warmly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims: They are perfectly in the Style and Manner of my Lord <hi>Clarendon;</hi> they contain nothing new in them, but only ſum up, in ſhort, what he had ſcattered through different Parts of the two firſt Volumes. Let the Reflections there made be never ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0093401202:174"/>
ſevere, they may naturally be ſuppoſed, in the Warmth of Compoſure, to have come from the Pen of an Hiſtorian, who had himſelf with Zeal oppoſed Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi>'s Meaſures, and both ſeen and felt the ſad Conſequences of them: But that the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his Hiſtory, no ways concerned in thoſe Tranſactions, ſhould, 60 Years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, coolly and deliberately make ſuch a needleſs Inſertion, is not to be imagined.</p>
               <p>The Complaint, on this and other Heads, ſhould have been brought againſt theſe Editors, while it was capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoroughly examined; at preſent, it comes a little too late, unleſs it were better ſupported: Their very Characters, to thoſe who knew them, and the Nature of the Evidence, to thoſe who did not, will be judged a ſufficient Confutation of it: For, pray, what is this Evidence? It conſiſts in an <hi>Hear-ſay from a Perſon, ſuperior to all Suſpicion,</hi> it ſeems, but <hi>too illuſtrious to be named:</hi> In an Appeal to <hi>another very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perſon,</hi> to <hi>a Reverend Doctor now liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>to a Gentleman of Diſtinction, both for Merit and Quality;</hi> none of whoſe Names are thought fit to be owned: The only one produced in the Caſe, is that of Mr. <hi>Smith, the Author of an excellent Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy;</hi> but certainly not an Author of Rank and Weight enough to blaſt the Credit of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0093401202:175"/>
ſuch an excellent Hiſtory: Of what Uſe can this Teſtimony be to his Purpoſe (even ſuppoſing the Account of it exact) when it is undoubtedly falſe, as to two of the three Perſons it is levelled at, Dr. <hi>Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge</hi> and myſelf: and may therefore be juſtly preſumed alike falſe, as to the third, Dr. <hi>Aldrich?</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> appears to have been ſo little in the Secret of the Edition of that Book, as not to have known even the Hands thro' which it paſſed; and is not therefore to be rely'd upon in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of any other Circumſtances relating to it, eſpecially with regard to Dr. <hi>Aldrich,</hi> his Governor at <hi>Chriſt-Church;</hi> for whom his Perſonal Averſion, and the true Reaſons of it, are too well underſtood to need ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining. I forbear ſaying any thing harſh of one, not able to anſwer for himſelf; but many, now alive, who knew them both, know how improbable, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incredible it is, that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſhould have had the leaſt Share in Dr. <hi>Aldrich</hi>'s Confidence, on ſo nice, or, indeed, on any Occaſion. The Gentleman, who ſeems to be <hi>convinced of the Truth of Mr.</hi> Smith<hi>'s Aſſertions,</hi> by his having pointed out and <hi>underlined</hi> the Paſſages, <hi>in Print,</hi> which he ſaid he was employ'd (by the three ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Deans) to <hi>interpolate and alter,</hi> in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, muſt ſurely have been very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0093401202:176"/>
to be convinced; otherwiſe, he would not have taken a mere <hi>Aſſertion</hi> for a Proof, in ſuch a Cauſe, and from ſuch a Perſon. The Story of this Death-bed Declaration ſlept for about twenty Years; near thirty have paſſed ſince the Hiſtory of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion was publiſhed (I mean the firſt Part of it) and not a few, ſince the Death of every Perſon that either was, or is falſly ſaid to have been, concerned in that Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, myſelf only excepted. I might, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, at the Diſtance of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> where I was when Mr. <hi>Oldmixon</hi> wrote, never have heard of what he lays to my Charge (Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of that kind being, as he knows, not very open to me) or, ſhould it reach me, I might yet, in my preſent Circumſtances, be ſuppoſed not over-ſollicitous to appear in the Diſproof of it. The Delay of the Accuſation therefore, if without Deſign, was not without its Advantages; and had it been deferred a little longer, till I was not only out of the Way, but out of the World, it had had a ſtill fairer Chance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being uncontradicted, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently credited. I have lived to hear this idle Tale, and to bear witneſs againſt it: There is no Vanity in hoping, that, old as I am, I ſhall outlive the Belief of it. An <hi>Holland</hi> Journal gave me the firſt Notice how I had been treated, and by that Means
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0093401202:177"/>
an Opportunity of vindicating myſelf; which I was the rather determined not to decline, becauſe I ſuffer'd in Company with others, Men of great Note and Merit, thro' whoſe Sides the Authority of a noble and uſeful Part of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory was ſtruck at. Where I only am aſperſed and wrong'd, I can, I thank God, more eaſily practiſe Patience, and ſubmit to Indignities and Injuries in Silence. A foreign Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has uſed me, in this Caſe, with greater Civility, and Temper, than Mr. <hi>Oldmixon,</hi> whom I know not that I have ever offended. I forgive him his ill Words, and his hard Thoughts, and only deſire him for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not to indulge himſelf in ill-natur'd Relations of this Kind, without better Vouchers. His Attack on me, and on the Dead, who he thought might be inſulted with equal Safety, is no Proof of a generous and worthy Mind; nor has he done any Honour to his own Hiſtory, by the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pains he has taken to diſcredit that of my Lord <hi>Clarendon;</hi> which, like the Character of its Author, will gain Strength by Time; and will be in the Hands and Eſteem of all Men, when Mr. <hi>Oldmixon</hi>'s unjuſt Cenſure of it will not be remembered, or not regarded.</p>

The Turn is Natural and Familiar, and there is an Air of Truth in all he ſays; but, I think, not the Hand of a Maſter. He tells his Tale, not like a Man who knows any thing of the Rules of Writing well, but as an eaſy Companion at a Table. I ſay of his Style, what he ſays of his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, <hi>Ma figure, qui n' êtoit pas déplaiſante, quoique je ne fuſſe pas du premier Ordre des Gens bien faits....</hi> i.e. My Figure, which did not diſpleaſe, tho' I could not be ranked among handſome People of the firſt Claſs. Tho' not of the firſt (or even ſecond) order
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0093401202:181"/>
of good Writers, he is yet agreeable.... I cannot poſſibly digeſt his taking Notice, p. 145. of the <hi>Chevalier de Rohan</hi>'s fine Legs. An Obſervation, that I ſhould have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted rather from the Pen of a fine Lady, and which ſhews that the <hi>Marquis</hi> was in his Nature a little too intent on ſuch Trifles. He is ſenſible of it, and excuſes himſelf in the Words which follow; but that Excuſe ſerves only to ſhew the Strength of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion he was under in this reſpect, ſince he had Judgment enough to ſee the Fault, and commits it notwithſtanding ...... Though I ſee he is manifeſtly piqu'd againſt <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. and his Miniſter <hi>Louvois,</hi> yet I am apt to believe him in all he ſays of both of them. His Reſentment ſeems to carry him no farther than to give him the Privilege of ſpeaking what he knew to be true; and, as the World goes, he that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows himſelf to cenſure the Great even thus far, muſt ſay a great deal of Ill of them... <hi>Of ſeveral</hi> French <hi>Poets he ſpeaks thus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rouſſeau</hi> appears to me ſtill a greater Poet, the more I conſider him. His Talents are unconfined, and enable him in every ſort of writing to which he turns himſelf equally to excel. But the old hard Words he makes uſe of puzzle me often (who care not to conſult a Dictionary) and chiefly in his Allegories.... <hi>Chaulieu, La Fare</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0093401202:182"/>
                  <hi>Chapelle,</hi> have many Graces of the eaſy and natural Style, but I do not think them ſo perfect in their way as <hi>Rouſſeau</hi> is in his; nor (to tell you the Truth) do I take ſuch Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in reading them. The Letters particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of <hi>Chaulieu,</hi> &amp;c. are not Maſter-pieces in their kind, and many of his little Copies of Verſes have nothing extraordinary in them. The Copy which touched me moſt is the Ode on <hi>Fontenay.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I cannot but obſerve, that under all <hi>Chaulieu</hi>'s ſeeming Gaiety, there is an Air of Melancholy which breaks out by Fits, and ſhews he was not at Eaſe in his own Mind. He endeavours to conceal it, and acts the Brave; but his Readers, with a little Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration, may ſee through the Diſguiſe. The Fears of Death haunt him perpetually, and appear even in thoſe Places, where he ſays, he is not afraid of it. I ſhould be glad to know how he died, whether with the ſame Courage he commends in Lady <hi>Mazarine.</hi> I ſhould gueſs not, by the Obſervations I have made of him.</p>
               <p>After peruſing a Diſſertation of Mr. <hi>de Boze,</hi> the Biſhop makes the following Remark.</p>
               <p>This Book, I find, was written two and thirty Years ago, and therefore it is no wonder
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0093401202:183"/>
that it ſhould not be equal to the later Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the ſame Author. One may ſay of it as <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaks of his Collection of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes; <hi>Non tale eſt hoc opus ut in arte poni poſſit, quaſi illa Minerva Phidiae; ſed tamen, ut ex eâdem officinâ exiſſe appareat.</hi> Though it be not of the ſame Value with his other Works, yet it is ſuch, as that one may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame Workman's Hand and Skill in it. He choſe a little contracted Subject; and had not Room therefore to ſhew his Talents at full length in managing it. And yet, narrow and dry as his Subject is, he has, by making ſeveral little Digreſſions, and by taking Occaſion to ſay many things which were not neceſſary to his Point, rendered it, not only inſtructive but entertaining.
<q>
                     <l>In tenui labor, at tenuis non gloria, ſi quem</l>

Whether his forth <hi>Gordean</hi> be a Reality or a Phantom; whether he owes his very being to this Gentleman, or is only reſcued from Oblivion, and brought again to Life by him, let the Antiquaries determine: I am ſo eaſy and indolent as not to think it of much Moment, which Way ſuch Facts are ſettled; nor ſhould I have thought what is written on this Point worth read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if this Author had not writ it. In all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0093401202:184"/>
he writes, one ſees the ſame Candor and Impartiality; the ſame Learning, good Senſe and Exactneſs. If the Argument he handles be not of Importance, he makes it ſo by his manner of handling it. So that I could wiſh, inſtead of four Books, he had written forty: as old as I am, and as many other things as I have to do, I ſhould read all of them....

The Author ſeems to have gone too deep in that ſort of Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and ſometimes not to have gone deep enough in others, which relate more immediately and naturally to his Subject. Forgive this Freedom, but it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0093401202:185"/>
is my real ſenſe of the Matter. Beſides, there is, I think, a want of Method in the whole<note n="*" place="bottom">The Author has changed the Order and Diſpoſition of his Work, in the laſt Edition of it.</note>; and the 19th Section, which is ſo long, is to me a little obſcure. The many learned Citations there, do not clear, but cloud the Author's Meaning, I am apt to imagine that in the muſical Part of it, he ſpeaks of what he does not himſelf tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly underſtand; for if he does, he would probably have expreſſed himſelf ſo, that his Reader alſo would have underſtood it, which, (as to me at leaſt) is not the Caſe. In one thing I differ from him eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially; my fixed Opinion is, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of all Books which are perfectly well writ, comes Originally from the Few, and not from the Many; and I think I could ſay a good deal in Defence of that Opinion...... I ſee him here, and every where, under the Image of

As to Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi>'s Piece, intitled, <hi>Reflexions ſur l'Eloquence,</hi> though what he ſays there be ſenſible and juſt; yet I do not ſee much of the great Man in it, and had no great Pleaſure in peruſing it.</p>
               <p>The following Remarks are made upon Mr. <hi>Fontenelle</hi>'s Manner of Writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I return you, Sir, the two Eloges, which I have peruſed with Pleaſure. I borrow that Word from your Language, becauſe we have none in our own that exactly expreſſes it. By the Account I had of thoſe Pieces, I imagined them very different from what I find them. Mr. <hi>Fontenelle</hi>'s Talents, as to the Knowledge of Nature, Mathematicks, and the <hi>Belles Lettres,</hi> are ſufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0093401202:187"/>
But I take notice particularly of the Art and Addreſs with which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts himſelf in nice Points, and the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and political Views by which his Pen is guided; a Quality, that does not often belong to Men who have ſpent ſo much of their time in ſtudying the Arts and Sciences. He has been miſinformed as to one little Particular, in the ſhort Draught he has given us of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s Figure. The <note n="†" place="bottom">The very lively and piercing Eye.</note>
                  <hi>oeil fort vif, &amp; fort perçant,</hi> which he gives him, did not belong to him, at leaſt not for twenty Years paſt, about which time I firſt came acquainted with him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in the whole Air of his Face and make, there was nothing of that penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sagacity which appears in his Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. He had ſomething rather languid in his Look and Manner, which did not raiſe any great Expectation in thoſe who did not know him. I ſee Mr. <hi>Fontenelle</hi> ſpeaks wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as to the MSS. relating to Antiquity, Hiſtory and Divinity, which Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> left behind him: I wiſh, for the Honour of our Country, that they may be as excellent in their Kind as thoſe he publiſhed. But I fear the Caſe is otherwiſe, and that he will be found to have been a great Maſter only
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0093401202:188"/>
in that one way to which he was by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inclined. It is enough for us poor limited Creatures, if we remarkably excel in any one Branch of Knowledge. We may have a Smattering of more; but it is beyond the Lot of our Nature, to attain any Perfection in them. Mr. <hi>Fontenelle</hi>'s Praiſe of Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Modeſty (and of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty in general) is to me the moſt pleaſing Part of that Deſcription he has given us of him. It is that Modeſty which will teach us to ſpeak, and think of the Antients with Reverence, eſpecially if we happen not to be thoroughly acquainted with them. Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> certainly was, and his great Veneration for them was one diſtinguiſhing Part of his Character, which I wonder (or rather, I do not wonder) that Mr. <hi>Fontenelle</hi> has omitted. His Opinion of them was, that they were Men of great Genius and ſuperior Minds, who had carried their Diſcoveries (particularly in Aſtronomy and other Parts of Mathematicks) much farther than now appears from what remains of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. One may apply to them, what was ſaid by an old learned Man, to one of leſs Knowledge and fewer Years, who inſulted him, <hi>I have forgot more Knowledge than ever you had.</hi> More of the Antients is loſt, than is preſerved, and perhaps our new Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries are not equal to thoſe old Loſſes.—

But this was not what I had in my Thoughts, when I ſat down to write: my Intention was only to expreſs the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I had in the Peruſal of what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, of which I could ſay more, if the End of the Page did not admoniſh me to tell you how much I am &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Book intitled, <hi>Diſſertation ſur la Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique des Anciens,</hi>

                  </note> I ſend you back, is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a very ſenſible and agreeable Manner, with a fine Turn of Thoughts and Words, as far as I am able to judge. I could wiſh only that the Writer had been a greater Maſter of his Subject, ſo as to have given us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincter and fuller Accounts of it, which would have left no Doubts upon the Minds of his Readers. I am ſatisfied that a Pen like his would have been able to expreſs the moſt nice and difficult Points of which he treats in a Way equally inſtructive and pleaſing, and have opened to us in Dialogue the Myſteries of Muſic, as eaſily and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly as Monſieur <hi>Fontenelle</hi> has done thoſe of Aſtronomy. The Picture of <hi>Leontium,</hi> with which the Reflections conclude, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely drawn; not only <hi>con Studio,</hi> but <hi>con Amore,</hi> as the <hi>Italians</hi> ſpeak of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite

Pieces of their beſt Maſters. One would think the Book was written on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for the ſake of the Character at the End of it: as the moſt material Part of a Letter is ſometimes careleſly thrown into a Poſtſcript...... I dare ſay <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi>

               <p>Let me ask you for my own Information, whether <hi>tourner de tous les ſens,</hi> be a proper Phraſe in that Caſe. To me it ſeems to ſpoil the Metaphor. He cites ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, which I am at a Loſs to explain; particularly p. 58. that of <hi>Varro de Repub. Rom. L.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> 1. Sure he does not mean the antient <hi>Varro,</hi> who wrote nothing that I know of, under that Title. He is beholden, I find, to the long Chapter of <hi>Abbé du Bois,</hi> where the antient Authorities, relating to his Subject, are collected; and he has
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0093401202:192"/>
made a free Uſe of them. But my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, to tell you rather what pleaſed me in the Book, than what I diſliked.</p>
               <p>From what I have read (in theſe Books) and other Pieces, ſince I came on this ſide of the Water, I have conceived a much greater Opinion of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> than I had while in <hi>England,</hi> and give him readily the Preference to all thoſe Writers of the Church of <hi>France</hi> which I am acquainted with. He is an univerſal Genius, and manages every thing he takes in Hand, like a Maſter. Good Senſe, and ſound Reflections attend all he ſays; which is expreſſed in the moſt agreeable and beautiful Manner, without any of the Pomp or Paint of falſe Oratory. He has particularly the Secret of knowing, not only what to ſay, but what not to ſay; the hardeſt Taſk even of the moſt exact and excellent Writers! ... But you know him, Sir, better than I; and I ſhould be to blame therefore in attempting any Part of his Character, did not Gratitude forbid me to return your Books, without giving you an Account of the Pleaſure I had in peruſing them. Even the Lady's Memoirs relating to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Princeſs, gave me a good deal; particularly that Part of them, where the Story of her Death is told, in as natural and affecting a Manner,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0093401202:193"/>
I think, as is poſſible. It has ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Air of Truth in it, as, at the ſame Time that it gives Conviction, moves Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and one can no more read it, than one could have been preſent at the ſad Scene of it, without Tears. I really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s Funeral Oration, to thoſe of <hi>Flechier</hi> or <hi>Bourdaloüe;</hi> tho' I think he would have wrote ſtill better, had he imitated them leſs; for, by that means, he now and then heightens his Expreſſion a little too much, and becomes unnatural. I gave you one Inſtance of that when I ſaw you laſt.</p>
               <p>The more I read of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> the more I value him, as a great and able Writer, and particularly for that Talent of taking as many Advantages of an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and giving him as few as any Man, I believe, that ever entered the Liſts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. There is a ſerious Warmth in all he ſays, and his manner of ſaying it, is noble and moving; and yet I queſtion, after all, whether he ſometimes is in good Earneſt. Pardon that Freedom, Sir, I have read him with Attention, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him narrowly. I have read all the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s <hi>Pieces</hi> that have been procured for me: and will wait for the reſt, till I can have them from your Hands. In the mean time, I will read
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0093401202:194"/>
worſe Books, that I may reliſh his the more, when I return to them; tho', to ſpeak the Truth, I know no Writer in your Tongue, that has leſs need to have his Reader ſo prepared for him. Do you hear nothing from your Friend <hi>Voltaire?</hi> Is <hi>England</hi> as well pleaſed with him, as it was? And is he as well pleaſed with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Or, does the Satisfaction on one ſide abate, in Proportion as it leſſens on the other? When will the ſecond Edition of his <hi>Henriade</hi> come out? Will it afford us a better Monument to the Memory of that Prince, and a nobler Likeneſs, than the Statue on <hi>Pont-neuf?</hi> It will, if it be as well finiſhed as it ſhould be. For<q>
                     <l>Non magis expreſſi vultus per ahenea ſigna,</l>
                     <l>Quàm per vatis opus mores animique virorum</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But the Spirit of Pedantry is coming upon me, and it is time therefore that I tell you, I am &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I find the very laſt Works of that great Man, <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Meaux are inferior to the reſt; but, nevertheleſs, I would be Maſter of all he certainly wrote. It is uſeful to obſerve even the Defects of Firſt-rate Writers, as well as their Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies. There is an ill-natured Pleaſure in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0093401202:195"/>
finding, that, as far exalted above us as they are, they ſometimes ſink down to our Level. The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> ſtudied Critical Knowledge late, with reſpect to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture; and was never therefore ſo true a Maſter of it, as he was of the Way of interpreting it by the Stream of Tradition. But the older he grew, the more admired he was; and that led him to think himſelf equal to every Man, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing; and particularly to write Books in <hi>Latin,</hi> and Comments on Scripture, in both which ways I find him unequal to himſelf; and I dare ſay, that is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of candid and judicious Perſons in your Communion.</p>
               <p>Our Friend, Father <hi>Courayer,</hi> has been purſued with Mandements, Cenſures and Arrêts; nor have they, I fear, yet done with him. I am concerned for the Fate of ſo valuable a Man, and ſo excellent a Writer, whoſe Views, I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, were innocent and good, however in the Manner of executing them, he comes to have given ſo much Offence. The twenty Biſhops that have cenſured him, ſeem to decline that Part of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute which relates to the Validity of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ordinations. However, they have not ſpared the Church of <hi>England,</hi> on other Accounts, but have repreſented her
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0093401202:196"/>
in a more diſadvantageous Light than ſhe deſerves; purely, I ſuppoſe, for want of knowing her. They cite the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> and cite thoſe Works of his, which were written expreſly againſt us; which ſurely is a very odd Way of repreſenting our Sentiments; juſt as if I ſhould quote Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi>'s Words, from any Pieces of his written againſt the Church of <hi>France,</hi> to prove what ſhe held in any Doctrine of Importance. I ſhould think it became me rather to produce the Writers of that Church, and the Acts and Monuments of it, for my Vouchers. The twenty Biſhops have taken this Method, once or twice; and if they had taken it always, they would have been leſs liable to Miſtakes in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of us. What the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> ſays, with regard to our Polity and Affairs, is not always to be rely'd on; for he was not a Maſter of that Subject. He was a very great Man; nor would he have leſſened his Character, not to have aimed ſometimes at ſeeming to know, what he really did not, in Matters that lay a little out of his Compaſs. Excuſe the Freedom I take with the Cenſurers, and the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity on which they build, in relation to our Matters; becauſe I have good Reaſon to think, that they have paid a Deference to it, at the Expence of Truth. My Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0093401202:197"/>
is very limited; and yet it would be no Preſumption in me to ſay, that I know better than the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> did, what is the Conſtitution, and what are the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Tenets of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But enough of theſe Reflections, into which the Mention of Father <hi>Courayer</hi> has led me.</p>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Taking <hi>London</hi> in my Way between <hi>Lewes</hi> and <hi>Kingſton,</hi> came to your Lordſhip's Houſe the Morning before I went to <hi>Kingſton,</hi> but your Lordſhip was then ſitting. I did then intend to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed your Lordſhip of what occurred in the Circuit thitherto, relating to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, eſpecially in <hi>Kent:</hi> and after I came from <hi>Kingſton,</hi> I found your Lordſhip was gone out of Town; and before your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn I ſet out for my Country-concerns here in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> 'till near next Term; ſo that what Account I give your Lordſhip muſt be by Letter.</p>
            <p>Tho' your Lordſhip has heard how the Verdict went in the Tryal at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Occaſioned by a Charity-Sermon preached there, by one <hi>Hendley</hi> of <hi>Iſtington.</hi> He died not long after.</note>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0093401202:213"/>
 yet perhaps it may not be unaccept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your Lordſhip, to have ſome Abſtract of the Matter ariſing in it. I began at ſix in the Morning, by my Appointment, and held till twelve. The Court was very full of Clergymen, and a great Auditory; and I gave both Sides Liberty to expatiate as they pleaſed, eſpecially the Defendants, that they might not ſay but that they had a full and fair Tryal. Moſt of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for the Proſecution were unwilling, and did prove the Facts but meanly; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Witneſſes for the Defendants did, upon queſtioning, prove all the Facts very fully upon all the Defendants, viz. <hi>Hendley</hi> the Preacher, the School-maſter and the two Collectors, being all who were ſerved with Proceſs. Serjeant <hi>Comins,</hi> Sir <hi>Conſt. Phipps</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blunden,</hi> Defendants, after an Harangue upon the Vertue of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and how eſſential to Chriſtianity (tho' I thought the Texts they cited proved ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Charity, viz. Good-Nature and Good-Neighbourhood, but I thought it not proper then to take Notice of the Diſtinction) they inſiſted chiefly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it would diſcourage all Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Charity-Schools, which would thus be in Danger of Subverſion.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0093401202:214"/>
2. That every Parſon might order Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, in his own Pariſh, for what Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities he pleaſe, eſpecially if approved of by the Biſhop.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Rubrick in the Communion Service, a Common-Prayer Book being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Court, does imply that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the Biſhop are intruſted in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of Charity in the Church; for it ſays, that if the Parſon and Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens diſagree in the Diſtribution, the Biſhop ſhall determine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Parſon of the Pariſh, and alſo the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> did give <hi>Hendley</hi> Leave to preach this Sermon, for this Purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That tho' the Sermon was done, yet the Prayer for the holy Catholic Church at the Communion Table was not quite finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as were not alſo the Sentences for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing Charity, when Mr. <hi>Farrington,</hi> the Juſtice of Peace, interrupted the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the two preſent Archbiſhops have preached Charity-Sermons, in <hi>London,</hi> for the Children of other Pariſhes there.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That there is no Precedent of ſuch an Indictment ever before.</p>
            <p>Too much Time was ſpent on both Sides, relating to what Power the Biſhops had antiently in the Diſtribution even of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0093401202:215"/>
Tythes and Profits relating to the Church, and their Rights to licence Preaching, and to direct what is to be done in Churches, and that Laymen are not to intermeddle there.</p>
            <p>Serjeant <hi>Darnel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> and Mr. <hi>Marſh</hi> were <hi>pro Rege.</hi> The Subſtance of what they all ſaid is herein mentioned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed with my own Thoughts in my ſumming up to the Jury.</p>
            <p>I firſt ſaid, that there were three Things much inſiſted on by the Defendants Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and anſwered by the Counſel on the other Side, which I thought ought to be pared off and put out of the Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. All Jealouſy of diſcouraging all Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Charity-Schools; for that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained juſt as they were before, as long as they kept within the Bounds of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Pariſhes. But tho' this Caſe was quite of a different Nature, relating to arbitrary Collections, and that in other Pariſhes, and the coming of fifty Boys and Girls toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begging for that Purpoſe; and if this was practiſed, it might do more Harm to Charity-Schools, by making them odious to their Pariſhes, whoſe Poor would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, by leſſening the Charity to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It ought to be put out of the Caſe, whether Mr. <hi>Hendley</hi> was authorized to preach there, or not; for that I thought
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0093401202:216"/>
it the ſame Caſe if the Parſon of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh himſelf had then preached, [It was at my Tongue's End, <hi>if the Biſhop himſelf had preached,</hi> as indeed it was the ſame; but I thought it better not to heat the Queſtion by a Suppoſal of the Biſhop's preaching] for that the Preaching was not the Point, being uſed only to excite giving; but the true Point was, whether the Collection was without lawful Authority; and therefore the Collecting of it in the Church is not a Jot better, in Point of Law, than if the fifty Boys and Girls had ſtood at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, and the Collectors had there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Charity of whom they could aſſemble about them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Matter I thought proper to be pared off (tho' ſo much debated on both Sides) whether it was a Crime (I ſuppoſe the Crime ſuggeſted in the Biſhop of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>'s Court) to interrupt the Collection before the Prayer for the holy Catholic Church, and the Sentences for Charity, were fully read, ſince they thought, that if ſuch Collecting is an unlawful Act, the proper Time to ſtop it is juſt when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, or ſoon after, as here was done by Mr. <hi>Farrington;</hi> for otherwiſe Common-Prayer, or a Sermon might be uſed to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify and give a Sanction to any unlawful Act, and this Stop might as well have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0093401202:217"/>
been in the Middle of the Common-Prayer, or of the Sermon, in caſe the unlawful Collection had then begun: ſo that the true Point is, whether the Collection was unlawful; and upon that all the Caſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</p>
            <p>As for the Aſſertion, that every Parſon of a Pariſh may order Collections, in his Pariſh for Charities, when and for what he pleaſes; I declared my Opinion, that he could not; it not being any Part of his Function, like reading Prayers, Preaching, Chriſtening, Burying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd I knew not how he was made Judge of the Times and Objects of all Charities within his Pariſh, tho' he might preach as much as he pleaſed upon the general Duty of Charity.</p>
            <p>As to the Rubrick in the Communion Service, I ſaid, I thought that was to be taken <hi>ſecundum ſubjectam materiam,</hi> viz. the ordinary Collection at the Communion, which is ever then uſed to be made for the Poor of that Pariſh, but ſhould not extend to every Collection the Parſon ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point for any foreign Charity, and that I did not till now hear that the Clergy did claim ſuch a Power. And farther I ſaid, that I thought thoſe Words of the Rubrick did not imply ſuch a Power in the Parſon; for the Words being [the Money given at the Offering ſhall be diſpoſed of to ſuch
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0093401202:218"/>
pious and charitable Uſes as the Parſon and the Church-wardens ſhall think fit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if they diſagree, it ſhall be diſpoſed of as the Ordinary ſhall appoint.] Such a Power of appointing a Collection at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is as much implied in the Church-wardens as in the Parſon, for they have as much Liberty to diſagree from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Diſtribution, as the Parſon has to diſagree from them; and ſo the Church-wardens might alſo appoint Collections for what Charities they pleaſed: but that I thought that the Parſon and Church-wardens, either jointly or ſeverally, could not appoint any Collection for Charity otherwiſe than in common Form for the Poor of their own Pariſh, and that thoſe are the charitable Uſes intended by the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, and particularly at the Communion, to the Service of which thoſe Words of the Rubrick are ſubjoined. [I hope your Lordſhip, on reading that Part of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick at the End of the Communion Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice will be of my Opinion, which I then ſuddenly declared, as to the Implication, and do not ſince alter, unleſs otherwiſe convinced.]</p>
            <p>As to what was mentioned of the two preſent Archbiſhops, it was for the Poor of the ſame Town, tho' of a different Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: and all the Circumſtances of thoſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0093401202:219"/>
Caſes do not now appear, nor were they litigated, as this Caſe is.</p>
            <p>As to the Objection, that there is no Precedent of ſuch an Indictment ever before.</p>
            <p>Sol.—There never was ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt before, that fifty Boys and Girls ſhould go into another Pariſh, in another County, and make a kind of Migration in ſuch a Body, really begging, tho' with great Formality. And tho' much might be ſaid (as the Counſel for the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted) to bring them within the Statute of Vagrants, eſpecially ſeeing the Stat. of 39. <hi>Eliz.</hi> C. 4. Paragr. 2. ſays, That all Perſons calling themſelves Scholars, going about begging, ſhall be accounted Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants: yet I judged it not proper to put the Caſe upon that Point, when I thought it ſo clear otherways, and fit ſo to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>I alſo told the Jury, that this Caſe did conſiſt of two Parts: the firſt but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and the other very general.</p>
            <p>As to the particular, it is relating to the Maintenance of the Poor, which is not of a Spiritual Nature, but a mere Lay-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and relating to the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the ſeveral Acts of Parliament do plainly eſteem it as ſuch, by ordering the Rates and Collections for the Poor, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0093401202:220"/>
putting the whole Managment into the Lay Hands of the Juſtices of the Peace, and the Over-ſeers of the Poor, who are to be nominated by the Juſtices of the Peace, and accountable to them, and by their Directions to ſet the Poor at Work, if they thought proper; and therefore a Juſtice of Peace, being then in the Church, might well take it to be a Matter within his Juriſdiction, and that he might ſtop ſuch a new and extraordinary Proceeding, newly begun among the Clergy, relating to the Maintenance of the Poor, and a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection made by Strangers, without the Conſent or Aſſiſtance of the Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens or Over-ſeers of the Poor of that Pariſh.</p>
            <p>But this Caſe, if under a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, is of a vaſt Extent, and mighty Conſequence to the King and the People, and at which the very Legiſlature may take great Umbrage. The levying of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is the tendereſt Part of our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if it may be done arbitrarily, under the Shew and Form of Charity, (which may comprize all good Works and all good Intentions) it cannot be ſaid whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may go, any more than it can be ſaid whither theſe fifty Boys and Girls may go: for as, by the ſame Reaſon, they may go into all the Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0093401202:221"/>
ſo Collections, as for Charities, may be ſet up in all the Churches in <hi>England</hi> by the Clergy, as often as they pleaſe: and tho' it be ſaid, it is all but Voluntary giving, yet it is a ſort of Compulſion, by the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Church, and vying with others, and being marked out, if refuſing, or giving meanly.</p>
            <p>In the Time of <hi>Charles</hi> I. the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment took great Offence at ſome Attempts for free Gifts to the Crown; and we hear that Cardinal <hi>Alberoni</hi> is now ſetting up the like all over <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides, here in <hi>England</hi> no Collection, even for Charity (unleſs for the Poor of the ſame Pariſh) is, by Law, to be made, but by the Leave and Permiſſion of the King, gathering of Money being ſo nice a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that it muſt not be done, even for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, without his Leave, in the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Caſes; and thence the antient Method of Briefs, under the Great Seal, has been uſed, even upon extreme great Loſſes by Fire. And the Stat. of 4 and 5 of <hi>Anne,</hi> have put the whole Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Briefs under the Regulation of the Court of Chancery, and impower the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Fines upon the Offenders. But this Method were giving a Go-by to all Royal Licences, and putting it in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Clergy to do all Acts of Charity of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0093401202:222"/>
themſelves at the Expence of the People, and to be ſole Judges of the Occaſions, and to make what Application and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>I told the Jury, that I was very clear of Opinion, in Point of Law, this was a Caſe of dangerous Conſequence, and was an Invaſion not only on the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, but alſo upon the Legiſlature, and that I thought the Defendants Guilty.</p>
            <p>The Jury ſtayed out but a little while and brought them in all Guilty. I then told the Defendants Counſel, that if they did not like my Opinion, in Point of Law, they might bring their Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and the Indictment being ſo ſpecial, it did equal a ſpecial Verdict, and they might have the Opinion of a ſpecial Court, if they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>I then ſet a Fine of a Noble upon each Defendant, I ſaying, it was ſo ſmall only becauſe it was made a Queſtion; but now that a Verdict had ſettled it, there would be very heavy Fines upon thoſe who ſhould preſume to offend in like Manner hereafter. Yet I heard that ſome Gentlemen in the Town had thereupon ſaid, that I had been too favourable to them by ſo ſmall Fines: but it was far from my Intention of any Favour to them, but of Service to the King; whereas, if great, it might have been ſaid,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0093401202:223"/>
that, while they were proſecuted for levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Money on the People, the Proſecution was only to levy Money upon them, when it was really to ſettle the Point: and great Fines might have raiſed Compaſſion, and perhaps a Collection for them. It would be great Satisfaction to me if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be of the ſame Opinion with me, as to the Smallneſs of the Fines; I am ſure I intended it for the beſt.</p>
            <p>I gave Mr. <hi>Woodford</hi> a News-Paper, wherein was an Advertiſement, which I thought very fit to be ſhewed to Superiors: that the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> had iſſued a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Letter, to all his Clergy, to collect Charities in their Pariſhes for the poor Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carages in <hi>England,</hi> which I thought much of a Kin to the late Collection in <hi>Kent,</hi> or rather more dangerous, not only by raiſing a vaſt Sum of Money (if the like in all Dioceſes) but alſo by marking out People how far affected to the Church throughout <hi>England,</hi> and caſting ſome Reflection upon Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s Bounty, and upon a benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Explanation after by his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, yet as if to be ſupported by begging: and this done in a Time of Taxes, which muſt appear the more heavy after ſuch Collections; and the Clergy would thus gain a Power of raiſing Money as they pleaſe, and applying it as they pleaſe. How
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0093401202:224"/>
this Project goes on I know not; but ſure it ought to be ſtopped: and for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, a Thing very appoſite was mentioned in the Debate of the late Tryal in <hi>Kent,</hi> That commonly about <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> when it is hard with the Poor for want of Work, in great Froſt and Snow, then the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> does ſend a Circular Letter, to the Pariſhes within the Bills of Mortality, to make Collections for the Poor, to be put into the Hands of the Lord Mayor. But it was alſo alledged in the ſame Tryal, that, pre-cedent to ſuch Circular Letter, of that Biſhop, the King ſends a Letter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Sign Manual, to that Biſhop, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing and requiring him ſo to do. This deſerves to be inquired into, and, if true, it is a Caſe in Point againſt this new Letter of the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> if without the King's Licence.</p>
            <p>A Man of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> worth nothing, was convicted before me of drinking the Pretender's Health. I ordered him to be whipped, in open Market, twice, till his Back was bloody, with a Month between the firſt and ſecond Whipping.</p>
            <p>And at <hi>Lewes,</hi> a Man of <hi>Rye</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed before me for drinking the Health of King <hi>James</hi> the Third, and ſaying, he knew no ſuch Perſon as King <hi>George.</hi> He had run out a good Eſtate by Looſeneſs, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0093401202:225"/>
had nothing left but an Annuity of thirty Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> for his Life. I fined him a hundred Pounds, and committed him till paid, and that he ſhould find good Sureties for his good Behaviour for three Years next after the Payment of the Fine. I told him, that by his paying a hundred Pounds to King <hi>George,</hi> he would certainly know there is ſuch a Perſon.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip's Notion, againſt ſetting a State Offender in the Pillory, was certainly very right, and did ſo convince me, that I have ever ſince ordered corporal or pecuniary Puniſhments upon them, as having a better Effect upon ſhameleſs People, and without giving the Mob an Opportunity to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome.</p>
            <p>I declared in all my Charges in this Circuit, as I did the two laſt Terms at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that the Number of baſe Libels, and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Papers, is intolerable, and that now a quicker Courſe will be taken about them; for that now the Government will not be ſo much troubling itſelf to find out the Authors of them, but as often as any ſuch Papers are found on the Tables of Coffee-Houſes, or other News-Houſes, the Maſter of the Houſe ſhall be anſwerable for ſuch Papers, and ſhall be proſecuted as the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher of them, and let him find out the Author, Letter-Writer, or Printer, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0093401202:226"/>
take Care, at his Peril, what Papers he takes in.</p>
            <p>This laſt was a Maiden Home-Circuit, which had not been known before, and is to be attributed to the late good Law of Tranſportation, which is well put in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution in the Counties near <hi>London,</hi> whence Tranſporting is eaſy, but not ſo well in other Parts of <hi>England.</hi> The Treaſury would ſave much Money, partly by paying fewer Rewards of forty Pounds, and partly by not long maintaining Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in Gaol, if ſome Rates were agreed to be given to Merchants to carry them off ſpeedily.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip's Order of Notification, to the Juſtices of Peace, had a very good Effect, for they appeared much better this Circuit than formerly, eſpecially in <hi>Surrey,</hi> where I told them, that I would requeſt your Lordſhip, that you would pleaſe to acquaint his Majeſty, at his Return, how very well, in particular, his Juſtices of Peace in <hi>Surrey</hi> had appeared, upon his Pleaſure being notified to them for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I did, in all my Charges, inform the Audience of the Occaſion and Neceſſity of that Notification, for that there was grown a Sort of general Neglect, all over <hi>England,</hi> of the Appearance of the Juſtices of Peace
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0093401202:227"/>
at the Aſſizes, when the Judges had often Matters to inform them of, by Command of his Majeſty; and Trials of Felons were often imperfect, by the Non-attendance of the committing Juſtice of Peace; and that their Attendance was a Reſpect due to the King and his Government, upon thoſe ſolemn Occaſions: and that it is no Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip upon them; there being three Excuſes, which will be readily admitted, if, upon the Call, mentioned to the Court, barely upon the Word of ſome other Juſtice, or Proof upon Oath by ſome other Perſon. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. If not fit to travel, by Age or want of Health. 2. If living out of the County. 3. If then actually out of the County. But if Juſtices of Peace ſhall remain at home, about their private Affairs, or to avoid the Trouble of a Journey to the Aſſizes, it ought to be looked on as a Neglect of the Duty of their Office: for they are not called only to notify to the People, that they are in Commiſſion, but to anſwer to their Names in Perſon.</p>
            <p>Many of thoſe in Commiſſion do not act, and have not taken the Oath of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: whereupon I ordered, in open Court, each Clerk of the Peace, againſt next Term, to tranſmit to your Lordſhip a Liſt of ſuch as reſide in the County, and refuſe to act; yet that he does, in the mean time,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0093401202:228"/>
know of them, if they perſiſt in ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal; that ſo it may be their own doing if they are put out of the Commiſſion, after his Majeſty's Favour to them in being put in.</p>
            <p>I fear I have tired your Lordſhip with this long, tho' abridged, Account: but your Lordſhip's Pardon will be an Addition to all your former Favours, to</p>

               <head>My CREED.</head>
               <p>I <hi>Believe</hi> in One God, Omniſcient, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, All-Merciful; and that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor whoſe Name is Bleſſed, is One, and there is no Unity like His; who alone Was, Is, and Will be my God. Who by his Almighty Power in one Moment created the Heaven and Earth; whoſe ſecond Thoughts cannot be more perfect than his firſt; and, therefore,</p>
               <p>I <hi>Believe</hi> that He, the Same Inſtant He, repleniſhed the World with Human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Male and Female; as well as with Beaſts of the Earth, and Fowls of the Air; and that his Mercy on his poor Creatures is ſo great, that he ordained none of them to feel the Fury of his Wrath.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Believe</hi> his Wiſdom to be ſo great, that He contrived at that Inſtant the Frame of all Things ſo wiſely, that on no Manner of Event, or Accident whatſoever, he will alter his firſt Deſign of Nature, to produce that which is called a Miracle.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Believe</hi> him ſo powerful, that without the Aſſiſtance of Angels, Devil, or any
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0093401202:281"/>
other inferior Beings, He is able to puniſh the Evil and reward the Good done by us Mortals; and that the ſame Breath of his Noſtrils can annihilate all which He crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But, if it ſo pleaſe Him, it may be as much to his Glory to have the World endure to Eternity.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Believe</hi> the Hiſtorical Books (Part of the Old Teſtament) to be wrote, as other Books are, by faithful Hiſtorians; and that they contain certain ſelect things worthy of Obſervation, and for Inſtruction, in order to the directing our Affairs in this World, and the Adoration of one God. And for the reſt, which contain the Propheſies of ſeveral Perſons, they were wrote according to the Style of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Jews</hi> to good Living, and from the Idolatry and evil Cuſtoms of their Neighbour-Nations; and ſee no Reaſon why ſome of thoſe Books called <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> ſhould not be admitted into the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the reſt; ſince they contain as good Precepts, and the Hiſtorical Parts better confirmed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors of the ſame Time.</p>
               <p>As for them of the New-Teſtament, I <hi>Believe</hi> they were wrote by the Followers of a Great Man, to make the reſt of the World believe what they, through their Zeal and Love for his Perſon, ſaw through a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0093401202:282"/>
Magnifying Glaſs, and for ſo much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as relates to Precepts of Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, very good.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Believe</hi> Chriſt to have been a great and good Man; conceived, born, died, and was buried as other Holy-Men. For I cannot think him God Omniſcient, ſince he Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith, that <hi>he did not know the time of the Day of Judgment, but the Father only.</hi> (Mark, Cap. 13. v. 32.)</p>
               <p>I <hi>Believe</hi> he may be preferred to a nearer Participation in the Beatific Viſion of God, than the reſt of good Men, to incline them to live peaceably and inoffenſively in this World, and to the Adoration of an Eternal Being.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Believe</hi> the ſeveral Religions of this World, ſo far as they center in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his Holy-Name, and conduce to well Living, to be equally acceptable to him.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Believe</hi> no Perſon hath Power to remit Sins but God himſelf.</p>
               <p>I think the Mercy of God ſo much a greater Attribute than his Juſtice, that he will not puniſh eternally for a temporary Fault; ſince moſt Tranſgreſſions againſt the Law of Nature, meet with ſome Part of their Puniſhment in this World, and that there cannot be a Rational Being, who can deny a Deity and the Providence thereof.</p>

Many Pieces of his, The Eſſay on Criticiſm. The Rape of the Lock. The Eſſays and Diſſertations on <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> have appeared in your Parts: and one Proof of their Excellency, is their being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized by Perſons of very eminent Ability and Rank<note n="*" place="bottom">See our former Volume.</note>. Other Languages<note n="†" place="bottom">They have been tranſlated both into <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian.</hi>
                  </note> are inrich'd
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0093401202:312"/>
with theſe and others of his Works; yet, would you believe it, He has tranſlated <hi>Homer,</hi> preſerved the Sublimity, Strength, Harmony, Cloſeneſs, and every other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of that venerable Poet, without knowing a Syllable of <hi>Greek;</hi> and with an abſolute Ignorance of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> His Eſſay on Criticiſm, is a ſmooth Repetition of <hi>Vida's</hi> Nonſenſe. His Paſtorals are no Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. Nor is he a Poet. Theſe things are brayed about our Street. The <hi>Aſinorum cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitus,</hi> the Din of <hi>Grubſtreet,</hi> Pretenders to Poetry, and falſe Critics, have aroſe to poiſon our Judgments; ſome ſay he is too little to write Well; others that he has only a Knack of writing, and theſe Wretches all write themſelves, to convince us it is without a Knack; Cellars are full of their Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, where, like ſo many mercileſs Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, they violently rack and torture Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to confeſs ſome Worth ſhe has not in her. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> is accounted by thoſe, not his Enemies, of over-much Borrowing; this you will rather praiſe then diſapprove, when you ſhall know, that the fineſt Thoughts of the beſt Writers were never made uſe of by him, till he had improved and made them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. View him in his Public Character, he is an Honour to our Nation; the Good and Wiſe rejoice, that ſuch and ſo notable a Genius is manifeſted amongſt us; he has
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0093401202:313"/>
the Satisfaction of not having lived in vain, and has obliged the valuable Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and is beloved by all the Learned, Good, and Wiſe. View him in Private Life, there is nothing more amiable and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing. He is an Example of the Duty we owe our Parents, and the Love we ought to bear our Friends. There is no Truth, if what I tell you is not true, no Friendſhip if I am not your Friend.</p>

               <p>FORGIVE me, if I obtrude my Advice; think not of Publiſhing, as yet. Your Works, like fine Painting and Wine, will ripen into more Worth by Age; you ſhould certainly complete the Cataſtrophe. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice you have reſiſted the Temptation offer'd; it would be Madneſs to throw an Appearance of Partiality on the Face of your Performance, which you have ſo bravely avoided in every other Part. The Devil is black enough in his real Character; the truer you can paint him, the more damnable he will appear. I can but laugh to ſee what an Appearance Kings, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, (the Guardians of Kings) make, when they are ſhewn in Hiſtory, ſtrip'd of Courtiers and Attendants. If in their Lives they had few ſure Friends, after their Deaths they ſhall have fewer. It is then that are Glory is taken from their Heads, and their Pride trampled on. Are they not
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0093401202:315"/>
deceived, my Friend, who think by Power to bury in Oblivion the ill Actions they are guilty of; or to keep Poſterity from the Knowledge of their Vices? I was the other Day at a Great Man's Levée; it made me ſhudder: He was corpulent and groſs of Body; and ſeem'd to me as if Fatning for ſome Sacrifice. I then thought a corrupt Miniſter, ſurrounded by his Creatures and Mercenaries, like the Man, who by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Practices had obtained the Services of evil Spirits, and thinks it noble to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on by Friends, but yet expects in the End, that they will tear him to Pieces.<note place="bottom">

               <p>I Shall now begin to trouble you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, believing you are ſettled in the Office, which will be another Sort of Life than that in <hi>France;</hi> but when I conſider you have ſo worthy a Perſon, and ſo good a Friend to act under, I then think nothing can ſtand in Conpetition with it. I ſhall be every Day more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Loſs of you here, which I hope you will make up to me, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me hear often from you. I have acquainted my Lord <hi>Jerſey</hi> with what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Relation to me and the <hi>Portugal</hi> Embaſſador in the Apartment of Monſieur <hi>de Torcy.</hi> He is going away, elſe it would be impoſſible but there muſt be farther Diſputes of that Nature. The firſt Opportunity I have, I ſhall certainly return his Rudeneſs. When you can do it conveniently, put my Lord <hi>Jerſey</hi> in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0093401202:327"/>
Mind of what we have often diſcourſed about, in Relation to the Affairs of <hi>France,</hi> and what he was ſo kind as to ſay he would prevent, if poſſible, when I had the Honour of ſeeing him laſt. You can eaſily imagine I ſhall not be able to obtain any Thing of this Court, if Matters of Moment muſt be only tranſacted by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Tallard.</hi> Not that I am deſirous of knowing more than what he would think proper, in the Poſt I am in. I need not tell you that as a great Expence is neceſſary here, ſo an Eſteem for the Perſon is as much; and I flatter myſelf I) ſhall not forfeit it, unleſs this Court finds I am only here to make a Show.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Tallard</hi> is daily expected, and it may be will ſtill make his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, as formerly, of the Delays he meets with in <hi>England.</hi> If ſo, I can now anſwer him much better, by what I have ſeen ſince my coming here.</p>
               <p>The Day of Parade is near, and, with the Help of the Advice you give me, it will go well. The Calaſh is done, and I like it; though I aſſure you the Coaches I brought from <hi>England</hi> do exceed it in gilding, painting and carving. All who ſee it do own, and the <hi>French</hi> confeſs, they cannot come up to our gilding, though they pretend theirs will laſt longer. I

The beſt Apartment is now <hi>a la Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çoiſe,</hi> Velvet and Damaſk Chairs with Gold Galoon, the Frames gilded, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tables, with large Looking Glaſſes, and I found it was abſolutely neceſſary, and when I was doing it I would do it well. The Chapel, which I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged into the Garden, looks very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>I cannot finiſh this without my Wiſhes that you may ſucceed in all Things for your Advantage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>HAving writ ſo lately, by Mr. <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope,</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> I do not trouble him now. I muſt deſire you to make my Excuſe, and acquaint him with the Contents of this. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at preſent acting at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> being not well, and wholly giving himſelf up to Devotions and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The Wound, which was very large, is healed; but it is thought they have done it too ſoon, becauſe the ſame Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours run all over his Body, ſometimes in his Stomach, Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely broke, and moſt Men are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he cannot recover, though he may go on ſome Time as he is. Father <hi>Coſme</hi> is run away with fifty thouſand Livres, which he had in his Hands, and which he was to diſtribute among the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> They think he may be gone for <hi>England,</hi> ſince he cannot be ſafe in any other Place.

If I learn any Thing of him you ſhall hear from me: nevertheleſs it may not be improper to make ſome Inquiry after him; and you will find by my former Accounts where his Acquaintance live in <hi>London.</hi> I was Yeſterday at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> where I made a Compliment to the King and the reſt of the Court, it being New-Years Day. I dined with Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers.</hi> I find them all very civil; but how long it will laſt you can beſt judge. I wonder my Servant has not been with you: the Buck-Seaſon muſt make it up. We want two Poſts, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had no Letters ſince the 31ſt of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> laſt. I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>WE have this Morning two Poſts from <hi>France,</hi> of the 20th and 23d. My Lord <hi>Jerſey</hi> commands me to acknowledge your Letter to him; and to tell you, that the Houſe of Lords ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo late, and he being obliged, after
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0093401202:339"/>
its riſing, to go to <hi>Kenſington,</hi> is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he does not write to you. You will ſee, by the Incloſed, what a Day's Work has been performed in the Houſe of Commons; the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Grants to be reaſſumed, and not even the third Part of them to be reſerved to the King; and the Miniſtry, ſome of our Friends parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, meaned and aimed at in the latter Part of their Vote. This all comes like a Torrent; and the few who would, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. In the Houſe of Lords, the King is a little more civilly uſed. As to the Buſineſs of <hi>Darien,</hi> his Majeſty is at leaſt juſtified in his Letters to the Governors of the Plantations. Thus we are, my good Lord, ſcrambling, and doing our beſt on one Side againſt the other, who are very troubleſome, not to ſay danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>We hear of the Complaints you make from Monſieur <hi>de Tallard,</hi> and prepare to redreſs them as well as we can. As to the Perſons mentioned in your Letter, Care will be taken.</p>
               <p>The King has not yet ſeen Lord <hi>Bazil,</hi> or any Addreſs from him. I do not hear that this Lord's Countrymen are quieter: I know not how far your Houſe's Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of to Day will go towards calming them. I am ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

My Lord <hi>Jerſey</hi> ſtill keeps his Bed, his Gout had a Fever which accompanied it; but God be thanked both thoſe Diſtempers abate, and I hope by next Poſt he will tell you ſo in his own Hand. In the mean Time, we take what Care we can about the Contents of your laſt Letter to my Lord; though God knows all the Care we take ſignifies little, conſidering how we are reſtrained as to the taking any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, though the Informations given make it highly neceſſary for the public Good: but you know <hi>England</hi> well enough in this Point my Lord.</p>

the King, he anſwered very civilly, but ſmartly: I have not yet the Words, but ſhall ſend them with the firſt. The Senſe was, That he was ſenſible the Nation lay under great Taxes; that he had and would contribute to the eaſing them by every Way which was juſt; that he thought he had the Power of gratifying ſome who had been actually in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Ireland,</hi> out of what was his.</p>
               <p>I had written your Lordſhip a long politic Letter, for I thought that <hi>Roger</hi> would have been diſpatched to you; but ſince there are no Particularities in the Affair I have ſpoke of, I have ſent Word to Mr. <hi>Woolaſton,</hi> that <hi>Roger</hi> may ſtay to go over with the Midwife for my Lady: <hi>Quod felix fauſtum<expan>

               <p>I ſhall do all I can to ſerve the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and ſhall take Care about the <hi>Horace,</hi> when I have it.

               <p>I Was very ſorry to hear my Lord <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> had quitted the Office, and much more ſo becauſe you alſo leave it. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you have long foreſeen this, and

cannot but have taken Care of yourſelf, being upon the Place: for you often ſaid, Men were forgot when abroad. The Hopes you give, that I am to correſpond with Mr. <hi>Vernon,</hi> makes me more eaſy than I ſhould have been.</p>
               <p>The Embaſſador of <hi>Savoy</hi> was with me, to let me know, that the Duke his Maſter had ordered Monſieur <hi>de la Tour,</hi> who was formerly his Envoy in <hi>England,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thither with the ſame Character.

               <p>I Am indebted to my good Lord <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> for two or three Letters; and it would be unreaſonable, if I did not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0093401202:355"/>
take the Opportunity of Mr. <hi>Chetwynd</hi>'s Return, to tell your Lordſhip what I know of the State of Things here. That we ſhall have a new Parliament is, I think, certain; at leaſt as far as I can ſee into the Matter. What Sort of Parliament it may prove, I cannot any Ways foreſee; but ſure there never was ſo much Work, as at preſent, in ſecuring Parties and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Elections. Whig and Tory are rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on both Sides, ſo violent, that the Government may eaſily be over-turned by the Madneſs of either Faction. We take it to be our Play to do nothing againſt common Senſe or common Law, and to be for thoſe who will ſupport the Crown, rather than oblige their Party; and in order to this, Men are preferred who are looked upon to be honeſt and moderate. In this Number (whether with Reaſon or not, Time muſt decide) we comprehend our Lord-Keeper and our new Secretary. Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and Lord <hi>Godolphin</hi> are in the Cabinet-Council; the latter is at the Head of the Treaſury; the former (we take it for granted) is to go Lord-Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> though it be yet a Secret. The two Companies are to be brought to an Agreement. (if poſſible) and Mr. <hi>Montague</hi>'s being made a Peer (we take for granted) may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0093401202:356"/>
to this Union, ſince, being in the Houſe of Commons, he would make an ill Figure, if he either declined to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the new, or ſhould find too great an Oppoſition in his endeavouring ſo to do. As to the Great Affair, I preſume the King will wholly defer it to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and act conjointly with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which I take to be the only Method. All that I can ſay more on this Head is, that I take it to be happy for the King, that the Will is preferred, by the <hi>French,</hi> at a Time when every Body was peeviſh againſt the Court (though with Reaſon God knows) about the Treaty. Count <hi>Tallard</hi> makes a fooliſh Figure here: I do not know, as yet, what he ſays to the King on this Occaſion; but every Body obſerves his Excellency to be very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and deſponding, and one may judge he has Reaſon to be ſo, as to his own Particular, concerning the Part he has been made to act, however his Country in general may approve their Monarch's Breach of Truth and Treaty. This I think is the preſent Figure of our Affairs, which I am glad to write to ſo good a Friend as my Lord <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> though to moſt of the World here, I am of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that to ſay leaſt is to do beſt. Your Friend my Lord <hi>Jerſey</hi> grows very much
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0093401202:357"/>
a Miniſter, and is in a fair Way of being very great. As to my own Affairs, I have a great many Friends who would ſet me up at <hi>Cambridge:</hi> I know I ſhall find great Oppoſition from Mr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s Party there, and great Trouble, in caſe I ſhould throw him out, from thoſe Men, who will never be ſatisfied, let me act as I will or can. If your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thinks it convenient, I know you will not refuſe me your Letter to the Univerſity. My Lord <hi>Sandwich</hi> is gone to <hi>Hinchinbrook,</hi> I hear, in order to ſet up <hi>Charles Boyle</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Wort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Montague</hi>'s Intereſt at <hi>Huntington: Vive la Guerre,</hi> whoſoever is choſen or caſt out, or on what Side ſoever Things turn.

               <p>HAving your Majeſty's Permiſſion to try if the Waters would contribute to the Re-eſtabliſhment of my Health, I was juſt got to this Place when I had the Honour of your Commands. I thought the beſt Way of executing them would be to communicate to my Lord <hi>Orf.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mont.</hi> and the D. of <hi>Shrew.</hi> (who before I left <hi>London</hi> had agreed upon a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about that Time) the Subject of my Lord <hi>P</hi>'s Letters, at the ſame Time let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them know how ſtrictly Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty required, that it ſhould remain an inviolable Secret.</p>
               <p>Since them Mr. M. and my Secretary are come down hither; and, upon their whole Diſcourſe, three Things have prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally occurred, and are humbly ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your Majeſty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the entertaining a Propoſal of this Nature ſeems to be attended with very many ill Conſequences, if the <hi>F.</hi> did not act a ſincere Part. But we were ſoon at Eaſe as to any Apprehenſion of this Sort; being fully aſſured Your Majeſty
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0093401202:361"/>
would not act but with the utmoſt Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in an Affair wherein the Glory, and the Safety of <hi>Europe</hi> were ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Thing conſidered was, the very ill Proſpect of what was like to happen upon the Death of the King of <hi>Sp.</hi> in Caſe nothing was done, previouſly, towards the providing againſt that Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which ſeemed probably to be very near; the King of <hi>F.</hi> having ſo great a Force, in ſuch a Readineſs, that he was in a Condition to take Poſſeſſion of <hi>Sp.</hi> before any other Prince could be ready to make a Stand. Your Majeſty is the beſt Judge, whether this be the Caſe, who are ſo perfectly informed of the Circumſtances of Parts abroad. But ſo far as relates to <hi>England,</hi> it would be Want of Duty not to give Your Majeſty this clear Account, That there is a Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Want of Spirit in the Nation univerſally, ſo as not at all to be diſpoſed to the Thought of entering into a new War, and that they ſeemed to be tired out with Taxes, to a Degree beyond what diſcerned, till it appeared upon the Occaſion of the late Elections. This is the Truth of the Fact, upon which Your Majeſty will determine what Reſolutions are proper to be taken.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0093401202:362"/>
3. That which remained was, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration what would be the Condition of <hi>Europe,</hi> if the Propoſal took Place. Of this we thought ourſelves little capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of judging: But it ſeemed, that if <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> was in the Hands of the <hi>F.</hi> they would be entirely Maſters of the <hi>Levant</hi> Trade; that if they were poſſeſſed of <hi>Final,</hi> and thoſe Ports on that Side, whereby <hi>Milan</hi> would be intirely ſhut out from Relief or any other Commerce, that Duchy would be of little Signification in the Hands of any Prince; and that if the King of <hi>F.</hi> was in Poſſeſſion of any Part of <hi>Guipuſcoa,</hi> which is mentioned in the Propoſal, beſides the Ports he would have in the Ocean, it does ſeem he would have as eaſy a Way of invading <hi>Sp.</hi> on that Side, as he now has on the Side of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> But it is not to be hoped, that <hi>F.</hi> will quit its Pretences to ſo great a Succeſſion, without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Advantages; and we are all aſſured your Majeſty will reduce the Terms as low as can be done, and make them as far as is poſſible in the preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Things, ſuch as may be ſome Foundation of the future Quiet of the Kingdom; which all your Subjects can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be convinced is your true Aim. If it could be brought to paſs, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0093401202:363"/>
might be ſome Way a Gainer by this Tranſaction, whether it was by the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Bavaria</hi> (who is the Gainer by your Majeſty's Interpoſition in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) his coming to an Agreement to let us have ſome Trade to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or in any other Manner, it would wonderfully indear your Majeſty to your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects.</p>
               <p>It does not appear, in Caſe this Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation ſhould proceed, what is to be done on your Part, in Order to make it take Place; whether any more be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired than that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> ſit ſtill, and <hi>F.</hi> itſelf is to ſee it executed; and if that be ſo, what Security ought to be expected, that, if our being nearer the <hi>French</hi> be ſucceſsful, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine themſelves to the Terms of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not attempt to make farther Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of their Succeſs.</p>

               <p>LAſt Night I came to this Place, where I received the Favour of yours, of the 18th Inſtant, with a Copy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0093401202:366"/>
of the Memorial of Monſieur <hi>Vryberge.</hi> I have ſince waited on the Penſionary, to acquaint him that her Majeſty did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely concur with the States-General in that Affair, and that I had Orders to uſe what Diligence I could for <hi>Vienna,</hi> in Order to prevent any Alteration of the Project, concerted with the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> for carrying the War into <hi>France,</hi> on that Side. I found, by the Advices he had received from <hi>Vienna,</hi> that he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that the Imperial Court may have a particular View towards <hi>Naples,</hi> which is certain will be of fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Beſides, the Manner of evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the Places by the <hi>French</hi> Troops in <hi>Italy,</hi> without the leaſt Notice of it, either to the Queen or to the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, gives them ſome Reaſons to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt the Intentions of that Court. He tells me, that they have received an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from Monſieur <hi>Amelot,</hi> and that the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> will order the Recruits he is to ſend for <hi>Italy.</hi> I hope I ſhall be able to ſet out for <hi>Duſſeldorp</hi> in a few Days, and then nothing will, I hope, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my being ſoon at <hi>Vienna,</hi> where I ſhall execute her Majeſty's Commands, to the utmoſt of my Power.

               <p>I Had not Time to write to you from <hi>Duſſeldorp,</hi> neither was their any Thing material that required Haſte. I came thither on the 4th, about Noon; and I had an Audience of the Elector this Evening: where, after a Compliment in the Name of her Majeſty, I acquainted him with my Orders, in Relation to his Intereſts at the Court of <hi>Vienna;</hi> and that the Queen's Miniſter, who was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſide there, would have the ſame Inſtructions. He expreſſed a very great Senſe of her Majeſty's Goodneſs to him, and he did enter into the whole Matter of his Right to the <hi>Upper-Palatinate,</hi> with ſome Warmth, complaining of the Uſage of that Court. He mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his ſeveral Titles, alſo a Treaty between the late Emperor and him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is agreed, that he ſhall be put in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0093401202:368"/>
which is ſince renewed by the preſent Emperor. I told him, it was of the laſt Importance, that his Troops in <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould be immediately recruited; that her Majeſty did not doubt but he had put it in ſuch a Method as that I might find them ſo at my Arrival in <hi>Italy.</hi> I muſt confeſs that I very much fear it, though I am perſuaded he will do all that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for he ſeemed not to diſguiſe the Difficulties he was under; as that his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were but lately arrived from <hi>Italy,</hi> and that the laſt Accounts he had, were that his Troops were at the Blockade of <hi>Cremona;</hi> that he was buying a Battalion at <hi>Onſpach,</hi> and that nothing ſhould be wanting that was in his Power to do. As to the Affair on the <hi>Upper-Rhine,</hi> he ſays, there will be an Army of 60,000 Men; that the Emperor will make his 12,000; the <hi>Circles</hi> have agreed on 20,000. This, with the Reſt who are there, and will be there, makes up the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: That there was alſo Care taken for a ſufficient Quantity of Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His two chief Miniſters were to ſee me, and I did find them agree in every Thing the Elector had told me. I did preſs them alſo about the Recruits in <hi>Italy.</hi> The next Day I had an Audience of the Electoreſs, and in the Evening I took
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0093401202:369"/>
Leave of both them. I need not mention the Expreſſions they both made Uſe of in Relation to her Majeſty, and how great a Senſe they ſhould ever have of it. The Electoreſs recommended to me the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of their Houſe, and alſo that of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> I found by the Elector, that the Great Duke had agreed to pay 100,000 Piſtoles; but that the <hi>Imperial</hi> Court inſiſted on 300,000, which he thought very extravagant, and which they ſeemed to own at <hi>Vienna,</hi> but that they thought it juſt, ſince he contributed, and was one of the chief Inſtruments in procuring the Will in Favour of the Duke of <hi>Anjou.</hi> That they threatened to ſend Troops thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as alſo to <hi>Genoua,</hi> in Caſe they would not pay what was demanded. I cannot tell what may be the Conſequence, in Caſe the <hi>Imperial</hi> Court ſhould carry this Matter too far. But if theſe Sums are actually employed in carrying on the War in <hi>Italy,</hi> we have no great Reaſon to complain. The Elector of <hi>Mayence</hi> being at <hi>Bamberg</hi> I ſhall not wait on him, but to-morrow I ſhall ſet out for <hi>Vienna,</hi> where I ſhall certainly be in ten Days. I ſuppoſe the Wind has been contrary, for I have received no Letters, nor ſhall I now till I come to <hi>Vienna,</hi> where I ſhall purſue my Inſtructions, and acquaint you how I find Matters there. I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Arrived here on the 21ſt, and had been here ſooner, had I not met with contrary Winds on the <hi>Danube;</hi> though I find it would have been much the ſame Thing; for this Week every one is in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. I have nevertheleſs ſeen Monſieur <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Wratiſlaw,</hi> and did not fail to take the firſt Opportunity to ſhew them the ill Conſequence to the intended Deſign of proſecuting the War into <hi>France,</hi> ſhould they firſt undertake that of <hi>Naples;</hi> and I did acquaint them with the Orders I had received from her Majeſty. As for Count <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> he was not ſo poſitive as the latter; but they both agreed in this; that it would not in the leaſt prejudice that Undertaking: for, ſince the <hi>French</hi> were intirely out of <hi>Italy,</hi> there were Troops ſufficient for both: that Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> was to ſtay, though his Preſence would have been of very great Conſequence: that they had given their Reaſons to Monſieur <hi>Dopf,</hi> which they hoped would ſatisfy her Majeſty, as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0093401202:371"/>
alſo the States-General. I had a great Deal of Diſcourſe on that Subject, with the latter, who I fear has no great Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Project, concerted with the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> When I preſſed that Matter, he did ſay, that, by the grand Alliance, that of <hi>Naples</hi> was firſt to be undertaken, and that the Emperor was not able to ſuſtain this War with ſome Aſſiſtance of that Nature: that every Thing was ready here, and they had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe they ſhould ſucceed with a ſmall Number of Troops. I do not doubt but her Majeſty is already informed of the Reaſons they alledge, and I cannot but think, though they do not poſitively own it, that the Orders are already gone to <hi>Italy.</hi> I have not as yet ſeen the Prince of <hi>Salms,</hi> he being indiſpoſed. I believe I ſhall have my Audience of the Emperor in a few Days. I fear the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> is ſtill in <hi>England,</hi> for there are now three Poſts wanting here. I have received none from <hi>England</hi> ſince I left the <hi>Hague.</hi> I hope by the next Poſt to give you a farther Account, and I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>BY the laſt Poſt I acquainted my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> with my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings here; and I have every little to add. The Emperor returns from <hi>Luxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> to-day, and I ſuppoſe I ſhall have my Audience of the Empreſs to-morrow. That of the Empreſs Dowager is over. Here are no Letters yet from <hi>England,</hi> ſo that I continue, as often as I ſee the Miniſters, to perſuade them to lay aſide the Expedition to <hi>Naples,</hi> which I believe they will do, unleſs it be approved of by her Majeſty. What makes them more zealous in that Matter is, the Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that, in <hi>Holland,</hi> they might be brought to conſent to the diſmembering it from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy; and if once they are in Poſſeſſion of it, <hi>England</hi> will never conſent to it. They flatter themſelves that, upon their appearing, the People will declare. As to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Expedition into <hi>France,</hi> it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this Court has ſent the Recruits they promiſed, as alſo the Mounting for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0093401202:373"/>
their Horſe. They alſo aſſure me, that they are doing what is neceſſary in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their Magazines: but I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that, in this, they will fall ſhort; and I can eaſily perceive, that their Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is only till their Troops can enter into <hi>France,</hi> and then they muſt ſubſiſt themſelves, or we muſt do it; which I find is the true Reaſon which makes them ſay, that of <hi>Provence</hi> is moſt prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, becauſe, as I ſuppoſe, they think they can be ſubſiſted by our Fleet. They aſſure me, that what is agreed on will be performed. They wait, with a great Deal of Impatience the Succeſs of the Duke of <hi>Marlborough.</hi> Count <hi>Piper</hi> did deliver a Memorial to the Emperor's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in Relation to the Battalion of <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> in ſuch Terms that he could not receive it. They did afterwards make ſome Alterations, but in Subſtance it is the ſame. You will ſoon ſee the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of this Court, in Relation to the Malecontents; for they have ſeemed of late to deſire an Accommodation; but it was on ſuch Terms that they might eaſily judge were impoſſible. So that Matter is at an End, and they have procured a Bull, from the Pope, for the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of Prince <hi>Rogotzky,</hi> and the Reſt of the conſiderable Men of the Catholics.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0093401202:374"/>
Whether it goes ſo far as to all who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to them, I cannot tell. This is at preſent a Secret, but I ſuppoſe it will ſoon be otherwiſe, if they intend it ſhall have any Effect. I ſhould imagine that they will not find their Account in it. It may be the Means to exaſperate them, and it may poſſibly induce them to quit that Religion.</p>
               <p>I am doing all I can in the Affair of the Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> I hope I ſhall ſoon bring it to ſome Concluſion. I wait to ſee what Orders I ſhall receive, for I believe there are ſome to come which do not pleaſe this Court. After that I ſhall go to <hi>Turin.</hi> I find they intend to ſend Count <hi>Galas</hi> for the <hi>Hague,</hi> and Count <hi>Queſtenberg</hi> for <hi>England.</hi> This is what Monſieur <hi>Galas</hi> does not like, and his Gentleman of the Horſe is come here on that Account. I have ſeen him who is intended for <hi>England,</hi> and he ſeems to own it. I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

I am heartily glad your Excellency has had ſo much Succeſs as to ſhake that Court from their ſpeculative Expedition againſt <hi>Naples:</hi> but I am very ſorry, that the Misfortune of our Army in <hi>Spain</hi> is an irreſiſtible Argument to lay aſide whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Project. The Accounts we have of this Diſaſter are only got from <hi>France;</hi> yet they bring too many Marks of Truth not to be credited, ſo far as that we have received a very great Loſs there. The Queen has done all that is poſſible on the ſudden Event; and, in this great Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, Orders are gone, this Night, to encourage the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to keep firm to the Alliance, and likewiſe to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to conſult with them the beſt Way to recover the Blow: But all this will be to no Purpoſe, unleſs the Emperor will exert himſelf on this Occaſion, not only to lay aſide the Expedition to <hi>Naples,</hi> to puſh vigorouſly into <hi>France,</hi> but alſo to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0093401202:376"/>
act offenſively upon the <hi>Rhine.</hi> Theſe are Points which the Queen hath ſo much at Heart, that her Majeſty hath written to the Emperor, with her own Hand. It follows this which I incloſe herewith to your Excellency, that you may pleaſe to deliver it with all poſſible Speed, and that you may be the better apprized of it. I incloſe alſo a Copy for your own Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal. Your Excellency will inforce it with ſuch Arguments as you will find, according to your own Sagacity, may beſt incline H. I. M.<note n="*" place="bottom">Her Imperial Majeſty.</note> to comply with ſo reaſonable a Deſire; and you will be pleaſed alſo to preſs the Emperor to ſend his Brother, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſome Troops; without that, it will be hard for her Majeſty to prevail with the States-General to join with her in ſending more Troops. I hope my Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> will be prevailed with to return immediately to <hi>Spain:</hi> It would be a very ill Return, if her Majeſty's Zeal ſhould occaſion a Coldneſs in the Court of <hi>Vienna.</hi> I am, with the greateſt Reſpect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </opener>
            <p>GIVE me Leave to ſpeak my Mind to you a little; ſure you will, becauſe you know whatever I ſhall ſay, proceeds from my Value for you. Conſider that a Surgeon muſt probe a Wound if he would make a perfect Cure; and give Pain to give Health. Would a Perſon in his Sences, whom I ſhould ſave from drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by pulling him out by the Hair, quarrel with me for hurting him, when he is ſafe out of the Water; therefore ſay, down, down <hi>Self,</hi> and read what follows.</p>
            <p>Chriſtianity, common Humanity, and my Profeſſion obliges me to do every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy all the real Service I can; but the Civility, the kind and friendly Welcome, which you have always received me with, does more particularly oblige me to do all I can to promote your Satisfaction; therefore let me put you in a Way to be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0093401202:382"/>
eaſy in this World, and happy in the next. Don't imagine now that you are fated to be unhappy: There's no ſuch Thing: God puts it in all our Powers to be happy; it is we make ourſelves miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: The Reaſon we don't find Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is, that we ſeek it <hi>without</hi> us, and would rather bring Things to agree with our Humour, than ſuit our Humour to what happens. Let us do as <hi>Mahomet</hi> did, when he called to the Mountain to come to him, to ſhew a Miracle to his gaping Diſciples, and the ſullen Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain did not ſtir: He ſaid to them, with all the Chearfulneſs in the World, ſince the Mountain will not come to <hi>Mahomet, Mahomet</hi> ſhall go to the Mountain; and ſo climbing up he pleaſed the People, and was perfectly ſatisfied himſelf. Since therefore Happineſs is to be found only within, give me Leave to draw your Picture, by ſetting the Mirror of Truth before you; which if you view atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and without Partiality, you'll find your Happineſs and lay hold of it: I don't mean your outward Form; or what fluttering Fellows call Roſes, Lillies, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Pearls, Balls of Snow, and Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Bliſs; ſhould I attempt it I might do you as much Wrong as the Painter has done: I don't mean what may be ſeen or
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0093401202:383"/>
felt, but what may be heard or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: Your Inſide therefore is doubly, compoſed of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Self,</hi> which God having made, united together like Man and Wife: Now they can never be parted from one another whilſt Life continues, and yet they often jar by the Devil's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Arts, who continually endeavours to ſet them at Variance; in which when he ſucceeds he makes a Perſon miſerable: But when <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Self</hi> go Hand in Hand, <hi>Soul,</hi> like a good Huſband, by his ſtrong Reaſon, governing with eaſy Sway, and <hi>Self,</hi> diffident of her own Strength, gladly ſubmitting to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; how bleſs'd are both! Guardian Angels attend to protect them, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from without can diſturb their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: But if <hi>Soul</hi> happens to be puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimous or tyrannical; or if <hi>Self</hi> gets it in her Head to wear the Breeches, then all the Guardian Angels leave <hi>Self,</hi> and the Devil ſends Evil Genii to take Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and ſtir up all the Paſſions to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Tormentors of <hi>Self,</hi> which before that, were all her Servants very ſubmiſſive and uſeful when <hi>Soul</hi> helped to keep them under. On the other Hand, the Evil Genii are ſo continually contending with harraſſing <hi>Soul</hi>'s Guardians, that they grow tired, and ſoon ſleep, regardleſs of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0093401202:384"/>
their Charge; then does Unhappineſs fill the whole mortal Frame; then it is we feel all the Racks and Tortures poſſible; and if we are now and then eaſy, it is when we are in moſt Danger; it is then the black Genii have put on the Apparel of the ſleeping Angel, and makes us miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take Evil for Good: This is my poor Friend's Caſe at preſent; but <hi>Soul</hi> has ſtill Force enough left to overcome <hi>Self,</hi> and Reaſon to bring it to a right Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if we can but rouſe <hi>Soul</hi>'s Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to our Aſſiſtance, which we will do, by drawing <hi>Self</hi>'s Picture as it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but I am afraid you'll ſcarce know or own it, on Account of its Deformity: But if you do know it, and bring it to an <hi>Examen,</hi> a little Converſation with <hi>Soul</hi> will ſtrangely mend it, and then Reaſon will make the Colours have a quite contrary Effect to Sir <hi>Godfrey Kneller</hi>'s; for they will brighten and beautify by Time, and the Picture which was ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will become the Admiration of all Beholders. I have been thus long before I begin to draw, to prepare you; and in Order to make you read with Patience, I promiſe you that <hi>Soul</hi>'s Picture which follows after this, will pleaſe better.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0093401202:385"/>
Firſt then, <hi>Self</hi> is plaguy forgetful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe does not remember that ever ſhe was younger or handſomer; ſhe does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ever ſhe was worſe in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and much unhappier than ſhe is at preſent; ſhe does not remember the Time when ſhe was much leſs reſpected than ſhe is at preſent; ſhe does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ſhe was taught, and ſhould believe, that Religion is the moſt uſeful Thing in Life; and I am afraid poor <hi>Self</hi> has forgot to ſay her Prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Self</hi> is very vain and arrogant; for <hi>Self</hi> does not attribute her good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the Bleſſing and unbounded Mercy of Providence, but fancies that all is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Wit and Beauty, and a fine Voice; but to ſnow you how much <hi>Self</hi> is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, tho' you may have theſe Qualities, remember, that the Captain is no Judge, and all is a Gift from Heaven: It is a Sign of too much Arrogance in <hi>Self,</hi> to let the World, and every new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance ſee, that ſhe manages All, by too often expoſing the Weakneſs of her Conſort; for tho' ſome may praiſe that Spirit which conquers a Man, others will put wrong Conſtructions upon it, not only reflecting upon <hi>Self's Choice,</hi> which calls her Judgment in Queſtion, but ſay hard Things, tho' very undeſerved;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0093401202:386"/>
and <hi>Self</hi> wont believe it without ſhe hears it; however, when <hi>Soul</hi> gets the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement again, <hi>Self</hi> will only do it in Caſes of Neceſſity, and before particular Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Self</hi> is very ſhort-ſighted, and a little Duſt, called <hi>Praiſe,</hi> thrown into her Eyes, makes her quite blind; for otherwiſe ſhe would not do the very ſame Thing ſhe blames and diſlikes in Others: <hi>Self</hi> will often ſwallow down a Heap of Flattery offer'd by Sneerers, drink Poiſon becauſe ſweeten'd with Honey, and believes the Givers to be ſincere, tho' the next Moment they expoſe the Credulity of the Perſon who they here have been praiſing: If they call her a Goddeſs, ſhe believes herſelf Divine, and expects to be worſhipped; if the next that comes pays no Homage, but is more ſincere, and gives Advice or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, he is called an Enemy, or at leaſt ſaid to be very ill bred; and if any comes to mortify her with direct Contradiction, ſhe could cruſh him to Atoms, and if ſhe has no Power to hurt him, ſhe will tear and pinch her own Fleſh. Tho' it was ridiculous in <hi>Teague</hi> to ſay, <hi>Arra Faith my Maſter, was my very good Friend and a Man of Senſe, and I am a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man;</hi> and in ſomebody elſe to ſay, <hi>Do you know what it is to affront one of</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0093401202:387"/>
               <hi>my Character, I am a S—;</hi> yet if <hi>Self</hi> could remember, ſhe often ſays the very ſame Things in other Words. But when <hi>Soul</hi> teaches, <hi>Self,</hi> even as a Dart thrown from an Enemy that wounds, may be made uſeful; if the Point be taken off, it will prove a good Walking-Cane to help <hi>Self</hi> to go upright.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Self</hi> is very paſſionate, and therefore cannot bear to be controul'd; ſhe thinks him an Enemy that does it in Earneſt, and believes he can be no Friend that does it in Jeſt: She miſcalls her Paſſions, not to part with them; Rage ſhe calls High-Spirit and Courage; and filling in with her Humour, True Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but ſhe is a great Coward; tho' ſhe can ſcratch and tear: If I miſtake not, <hi>Self</hi> is terribly afraid of <hi>Self,</hi> and the Thoughts of being alone is a moſt uncomfortable Proſpect: To have One that we can unboſom to without Reſerve or Fear, may be called having a Friend; but it is not natural Friendſhip to have One that ſhall love where we love, and hate becauſe we hate, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Unreaſonableneſs of every Paſſion, or the Juſtice or Injuſtice of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Reſentment; this is by no Means to be called Friendſhip; it is only a Union of Intereſt; God forbid that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0093401202:388"/>
ſhould be called Friendſhip. Can High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waymen be called Friends? Yet they do all this, they ſing together, they kill together, they eat, drink, and whore together; but as they don't act upon Principle, upon the leaſt Jar, or falling out, they hang one another. Friendſhip is a Virtue, and nothing of Crime can be conſiſtent with it: Follies and Weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we cannot be without in this L ſe; but a true Friendſhip is to pity and forgive, not to encourage them: It is having a Slave and fawning Paraſite, not a Fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd, to have ſuch a One as <hi>Self</hi> calls ſo: A True Friend will adviſe, and repro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and condemn <hi>Self</hi> for the Sake of <hi>Soul,</hi> even to the Hazard of diſobliging <hi>Self:</hi> A Friend muſt help us to curb our Paſſions, refuſe Aſſiſtances in Things unjuſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to engage Heaven in our Cauſe, when juſt, and never let us alone till we apply alſo to the Almighty Power, and make Him our common Friend: In a Word, Friendſhip is directed by Right Reaſon, and cannot conſiſt without Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Self</hi> is a great Fop and agreat Slattern: <hi>Soul</hi> has given her very good Cloaths, fine Ornaments, plain and neat, but <hi>Self</hi> either leaves them, like a Slut, in every Corner of the Houſe; or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0093401202:389"/>
when ſhe puts them on, ſhe does bedizen them with Lace and Embroidery, Frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Ruffles, Patches, and Powder, that you can hardly ſee enough of the Garment to diſtinguiſh the excellent Stuff which it is made of: <hi>Soul</hi> has given her a fine Gown, called <hi>Good Humour,</hi> whoſe Outſide was a celeſtial Blue, called <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> Lin'd with a white Perſian, called <hi>Humility;</hi> what does <hi>Self,</hi> but throws off the Outſide, ſaying it was fooliſh Stuff, and tramples the Lining under Foot, ſo that one could ſcarce know it: <hi>Soul</hi> had given her a Stomacher, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and charg'd her to wear it only on <hi>Sundays</hi> and Holy-Days, and never to put it on without ſerpentine Lace, called <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> with a Charge to let other People diſcover it, and not do as Court Ladies commonly do by their Cloaths, that is, ſhew them to all their Acquaintance as ſoon as they get them; but the giddy Thing wears it every Day, loſes her Lace, and, as Children do, cries every Moment, who ſee my fine Stomacher; ſo that it muſt be a diſcerning Eye that knows it to be genuine: <hi>Soul</hi> gives her a fine Snuff-Box, in the Shape of a Heart, full of plain <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Snuff; <hi>Self</hi> throws it out, and fills it with Gunpowder and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore: <hi>Soul</hi> gives her a Cenſor full of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0093401202:390"/>
Balm, called <hi>Gratitude,</hi> charging her to turn the Pipe of it upwards, and ſet it on Fire twice a Day, to make the Smoke of it riſe up to Heaven; aſſuring her, that ſhe would then find ſuch a Fragrancy ſpread around, that would cure all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers of Mind, and eaſe all bodily Pain; but poor <hi>Self</hi> ſaid there was too much Trouble in the Management of it; that ſhe had forgot her Inſtructions, and the Book was too big that gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it; that there was indeed a Place where People met to uſe their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, but ſhe had more Inclination to ſleep, than manage her Cenſor, when ſhe came there; and therefore thought it better to ſtay at Home: Since that, <hi>Self</hi> has never been rightly eaſy.</p>
            <p>SOUL<hi>'s PICTURE in MINIATURE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>SOUL</hi> is honeſt, generous, grateful, unwilling to do, but unwilling to bear Wrong; ſincere and open, but wants Help to diſtinguiſn and correct the Faults of <hi>Self,</hi> and has not enough been uſed to reaſon and reflect, which makes us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times miſtake Right for Wrong; but let him put on Paſſions and Conſideration, and once rouſe his good Qualities, and <hi>Self</hi> will be reformed and re-united; the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0093401202:391"/>
Angels will reſume their Charge; Hell will be baffled, Heaven will rejoice, and Earth will honour and admire: If <hi>Soul</hi> will learn to forgive, he will learn to be eaſy; and ſuch is the Pleaſure of the Victory over <hi>Self,</hi> in that Caſe, that it is worth all the Pains, and none know but thoſe who have felt it: It is of the Nature of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, but far ſuperior; without Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here, there is no Forgiveneſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with it there is endleſs Joy, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is the Way to Exaltation here and hereafter: To become Good, conſider how many you may ſee excel you in Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, on whom Heaven has not beſtowed the Tenth Part of what you enjoy, to make yourſelf happy; nor can you mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, when you conſider how many, far more deſerving than yourſelf, in every Reſpect, are infinitely more miſerable than ever you was in your Life. I don't doubt but the good Senſe you are Miſtreſs of, will make you know, when you read, and conſider what I have ſaid; and I hope you will believe I wiſh you as well, and am as much Your Friend, as any one living.</p>
