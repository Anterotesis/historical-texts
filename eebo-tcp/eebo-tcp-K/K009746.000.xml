            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT would be unjuſt to ſend the following Pieces into the World, without acknowledging the high Reſpect I have for Mr. M'PHERSON's great Abilities; ſince he has a very particular Right to ſhare in the Reputation theſe Poems may chance to acquire; the Verſification being made from his elegant and ſpirited Proſe Tranſlation of <hi>Oſſian</hi>'s inimitable Performances. That we have them preſerved from being ſwallowed up in the Gulph of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, is owing to his fine Diſcernment, and incomparable Induſtry.</p>

            <p>THOUGH I am ſeldom inclined to think much of my own little Abilities, I cannot help feeling ſome Vanity, when their Eſſays are crown'd with the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo great a Maſter in the Belles Lettres, as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. To be able to engage the Attention, or acquire the Patronage of the Earl of POMFRET, implies Merit: Since to the many Virtues which reflect Honour upon elevated Rank, he adds deep Penetration, ſtrong Judgment, well digeſted Learning, and a Taſte truly elegant.</p>
            <p>I ſhould think myſelf, My Lord, ungrateful if I omitted this Opportunity of aſſuring you, I ſhall always retain a deep Senſe of the very particular Favours you have been pleaſed to confer upon me. Among the happieſt Hours of my Life, thoſe muſt ſtand foremoſt, in which I have had the Honour of being admitted to your Lordſhip's Converſation, from which I never aroſe without conſiderable Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; an Increaſe of which it ſhall be my utmoſt Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deſerve.</p>
            <p>It was the good Fortune of the following Pieces to pleaſe you in Manuſcript, they therefore intreat to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to the public Light under the Sanction of your Lordſhip's Protection; an Honour which, among many other Obligations, ſhall be always acknowledg'd, with due Reſpect, by, My Lord,</p>

               <p>FINGAL, King of <hi>Morven,</hi> returning Home vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious from the Expedition in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the Epic Poem bearing his Name, made a Feaſt, to which all his Chiefs, <hi>Ma-ronnan</hi> and <hi>Aldo</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, were invited. The Neglect ſeems to have been accidental; however they reſented it ſo ſtrongly as to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their native Country, and enter into the Service of <hi>Erragon,</hi> King of <hi>Sora,</hi> a Name given to ſome Part of <hi>Scandinavia.</hi> Here <hi>Lorma,</hi> the beautiful Wife of <hi>Erragon,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Aldo</hi> by chance, his Reputation as a Warrior being very high, fell in Love with him. He return'd her Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and they fled into <hi>Morven. Erragon</hi> purſuing them, invaded that Kingdon with a powerful Force, and ſlew <hi>Aldo</hi> in ſingle Combat, but was himſelf ſlain by <hi>Gaul,</hi> the Son of <hi>Morni,</hi> and his Army defeated. This is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the enſuing Poem, which is beautiful, ſentimental, and intereſting. It was deliver'd by <hi>Oſſian,</hi> after becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blind, to a <hi>Culdee,</hi> or Chriſtian Hermit, who led a recluſe Life near him, and whoſe Sacred Hymns he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined were compoſed in Honour of his deceaſed Chiefs, or Addreſſes to the Spirits in the Air.</p>

                  <l>My Bones are hears'd in their eternal Home:</l>
                  <l>Clos'd in the wintry Houſe of Death I lie;</l>
                  <l>Grief, for thy Loſs, drank all my Vitals dry.</l>

                     <l>Yet hear, <hi>Vinella,</hi> ah! ſhe glides away,</l>
                     <l>Like the grey Dawn before the riſing Day.</l>
                     <l>But one Word more, my Love, and then depart,—</l>
                     <l>Behold theſe Tears, the Offspring of my Heart;</l>
                     <l>I fear 'twill break,—'tis wrung with conſtant Grief,—</l>
                     <l>A Look, a Word, will waft ſome kind Relief.</l>
                     <l>When living, fairer than the Light wer't thou;</l>
                     <l>But pale and ghaſtly are thy Beauties now.</l>
                     <l>Her brooding Wings ſhould awful Silence ſpread,</l>
                     <l>Dwell in the Gale ſuſpended o'er my Head,</l>
                     <l>Thence my ſad Soul with ſofteſt Accents chear;</l>
                     <l>Thy well-known Voice I could for ever hear;</l>
                     <l>Come on the Mountain Blaſt, and with the Sound,</l>
                     <l>Diſperſe the Mid-Day Silence hovering round.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>For on the Summit will I ſit alone,</l>
                     <l>And by the moſſy murmuring Fountain moan.</l>
