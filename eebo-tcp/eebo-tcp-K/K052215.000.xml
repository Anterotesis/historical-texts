            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I always had a
ſtrong Inclination
to Reading, from
the Time I firſt
went to <hi>Emanuel</hi>-College
in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and had
gone through the moſt valuable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0080201500:4"/>
ancient Writers; during my ſtay
in <hi>Lilliput,</hi> I was very inquiſitive
about the ſtate of Learning in
that Nation, and received the
following Information upon that
Subject.</p>
            <p>IN former Ages, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Iſland <hi>Blefuſcu</hi> was,
in many reſpects, like what we
call a Commonwealth, and for
a long time flouriſhed both in
Arms and Learning, whilſt the
<hi>Lilliputians</hi> were a barbarous
People; at this Time many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Books were wrote in
Oratory, Poetry, Hiſtory, and
Philoſophy, but the <hi>Blefuſcudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
having at length loſt their
Liberties and Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0080201500:5"/>
which was changed into
an Empire, Learning decay'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them very faſt; the
faſter by reaſon of hot Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
which aroſe concerning
the proper manner of Dreſſing
and Eating Eggs; and in theſe
the whole Studies of all the
Learned Men of that Age were
conſumed.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Emperor of <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſcu,</hi>
that he might ingratiate
himſelf with his People, whom
he had enſlaved, undertook an
Expedition againſt the Iſland of
<hi>Lilliput</hi>; which being then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by ſeveral petty Kings,
ignorant of the Arts of War,
was, by Degrees, ſubdued to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0080201500:6"/>
Empire of <hi>Blefuſcu.</hi> During
this Intercourſe between the two
Nations, the <hi>Blefuſcudian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
was very much changed,
by the mixture of the <hi>Lillipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>;
and thoſe Authors who
wrote in the old Language were
neglected, and underſtood by
very few.</p>
            <p>IN proceſs of Time the <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liputians</hi>
grew weary of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
flung off the Foreign
Yoke, ſet up an Emperor of
their own with great Succeſs,
and ever ſince have been a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Empire from that of <hi>Blefuſcu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0080201500:7"/>
As they were an Ingenious
People, and bleſſed with a Race
of good Emperors, they ſoon
excelled their Neighbours in
Learning and Arms; they got
together all the old <hi>Blefuſcudian</hi>
Books, their Emperor founded
a <hi>Gomflaſtru,</hi> or Seminary, with
different Schools, to inſtruct
their Youth in the old <hi>Blefuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cudian</hi>
Language and Learning;
and from thence choſe their
<hi>Nardacs, Glumglums,</hi> and <hi>Hurgos,</hi>
and the Emperors had them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
a large Collection of
theſe Books in a Library belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Palace.</p>
            <p>THUS the <hi>Lilliputians</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
in Politeneſs and Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0080201500:8"/>
for ſome Ages; till at
length, by the Plenty of a long
Peace, they alſo grew Corrupt,
gave themſelves up to Idleneſs,
Luxury, and Intriguing, and
fell into Controverſies about
breaking their Eggs; the old
<hi>Blefuſcudian</hi> Books were laid
aſide, and nothing regarded but
Eggs and Politicks. The <hi>Gom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaſtru</hi>
indeed continued, each
School had its <hi>Mulro,</hi> or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Scholars; but the
taſte of the Age being changed,
they only turned over the old
Authors to amuſe themſelves,
and enjoy'd the moderate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
bequeathed to them by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Emperors. The preſent
Emperor indeed had endeavour'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0080201500:9"/>
to bring them into Eſteem again,
he encreaſed their Poſſeſſions,
and gave a Noble Preſent of
Books to the <hi>Gomflaſtru</hi>; but
having a debauched inconſtant
People to rule over, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kept in continual Alarms of
Wars by his Neighbours, he
had not leiſure to perfect his
good Intentions.</p>
            <p>I was at this Time in his
Favour, and when He heard
that I had been inquiſitive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
theſe Affairs, He very
graciouſly deſired me to look
into his Library, and ſent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to the Keeper of it to uſe
me with great Reſpect, and to
preſent me with Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0080201500:10"/>
Books, ſuch as I ſhould
chooſe.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, upon a Day
appointed, I went to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,
which I took a view of
in the ſame manner as I had
done of the reſt of the palace,
by lying down and looking in
at the Window: The Building
was ruinous, the Inſide duſty,
the Books many in Number,
but ſcattered about in great
Diſorder; the Library-Keeper,
whoſe Name is BULLUM, was
alone ſtalking amidſt the Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh.
As ſoon as he ſaw my
Face at the Window, he made
his beſt Bow, and began his
Speech to me, which, as I was
afterwards informed, he had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0080201500:11"/>
taken a great deal of Pains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
knowing me to be in the
Emperor's good Graces. Moſt
part of what he ſpoke was
unintelligible to me, by a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Mixture of the old
<hi>Blefuſcudian</hi> Language: And
what I did underſtand was
fulſome Flattery, and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that nothing mortal could
deſerve.</p>
            <p>THIS was very dull Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to a Man of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
and thereupon finding
his Speech would be long, and
that he was forced to ſtrain
his Voice to make me hear at
that diſtance; I thought it
would be a kindneſs to us both
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0080201500:12"/>
to put a ſtop to him, which
I did, returning him Thanks,
in few Words, for his great
Opinion of me, and deſired to
ſee him the next Day, that I
might chooſe out the Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Books which the Emperor
had given me.</p>
            <p>BULLUM, as I heard after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
was in great Wrath,
and loaded me with many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious
Names, for refuſing
to hear his Speech out, and
daring to treat a Man of his
Learning with ſo little reſpect.
However, he ſtifled his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a little for the preſent,
and came to me at the Time
appointed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0080201500:13"/>
I DESIRED him to ſhew
me a Catalogue of the Books,
and to give me ſome Account
of what they treated of, that
I might be able to make a
Choice. He replied, That he
had not troubled himſelf to
bring a written Catalogue, but
that he had one in his Memory,
and immediately he repeated to
me the Titles of a vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of old <hi>Blefuſcudian</hi> Books,
and run on with a great flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of Speech, till he was out
of Breath.</p>
            <p>IT was a Pain to me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
Laughing, to hear BULLUM
ſputter out ſo much Jargon;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0080201500:14"/>
at laſt I told him, That I was
not in the leaſt wiſer for what
he had ſaid, becauſe I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
not a Syllable of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
he ſpoke. At that, as
he ſtood on the Table before
me, he put out his Under-Lip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ſtaring me full in the Face,
ſaid, with a great deal of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<hi>Not underſtand</hi> Blefuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian!
<hi>What do you underſtand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I WAS a little Diſcompoſed
at this Treatment; but not
knowing then what Intereſt he
had at Court, I reſolved to uſe
him Civilly; and replied, That
I underſtood eight or nine Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
if there was any Merit
in that; but that none of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0080201500:15"/>
Books in his Library would be
of any Uſe to me, that were
not written in <hi>Lilliputian. Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liputian!</hi>
ſays he, <hi>I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the Titles of many of them,
but I will ſend you Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in a few Days:</hi> And thus
he left me.</p>
            <p>I WAS very impatient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this curious Preſent; but
BULLUM broke his Word; for
about this Time my Intereſt
at Court began to decline. I
could not prevail upon him to
deliver the Books to me: At
laſt, after much Importunity,
he came to me himſelf, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by a Servant, with only
Five Books.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0080201500:16"/>
I WAS ſurprized at this, and
aſked if the reſt were upon the
Road: He anſwer'd, That ſince
he had ſeen me laſt, he had
ſpent ſome Days in carefully
peruſing the Emperor's Orders;
that he had diſcovered the
Word <hi>Hundred</hi> to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpolation;
and that the true
Reading was <hi>Five</hi> Books, which,
in Obedience to the Emperor,
he had brought me.</p>
            <p>I HAD indeed been put off
ſo long, that I ſuſpected I
ſhould have had none, and
therefore agreed to have the
Five Books, deſigning to have
made my Complaint afterwards,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0080201500:17"/>
but BULLUM had another
Trick to play me. It was the
Cuſtom, he ſaid, for all Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to make him a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
in Writing, which he
deſired me to comply with, and
then he would deliver the Books
to me. He had brought the
Form, which I was to tranſcribe
and ſign with my own Name.
The Words were theſe:</p>
            <q>
               <p>Be it known to all Men,
That BULLUM the Great
Library-Keeper to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of <hi>Lilliput,</hi> and <hi>Mulro</hi>
in the <hi>Gomflaſtru,</hi> is a Man
of vaſt Erudition and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
all Parts of the World
ring with his Praiſes; and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0080201500:18"/>
whilſt I was honoured with
his Acquaintance, he uſed me
with ſingular Humanity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quinbus Fleſtrin.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>OUT of an earneſt Deſire
to get Poſſeſſion of the Books,
I ſubmitted even to this Demand
of BULLUM, who then ordering
them to be flung down before
me, turned nimbly upon his
Heel and left me. He had
picked out for me the Five
worſt Books in the Library,
according to his Judgment; but
when I came to peruſe them
with a Microſcope, (the biggeſt
being a Folio about half an Inch
long) I found they were very
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0080201500:19"/>
Curious in their kind, but treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

THESE Books I brought ſafe
with me to <hi>England,</hi> and deſign
either to publiſh them, or elſe
to preſent them to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
which I had once the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be a Member of.</p>
            <p>BUT to return to BULLUM.
I was amazed at his Behaviour
towards me, eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I was a <hi>Nardac,</hi> to which
Title he generally paid a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Reſpect. This made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
deſirous of getting an Account
of his Hiſtory and Character,
which, having ſomething extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
in them, I ſhall lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Reader.</p>

BULLUM is a tall raw-bon'd
Man, I believe near ſix Inches
and an half high; from his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
he apply'd himſelf, with
great Induſtry, to the old <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſcudian</hi>
Language, in which he
made ſuch a Progreſs, that he
almoſt forgot his native <hi>Lillipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>;
and at this Time he can
neither Write nor ſpeak two
Sentences, without a Mixture of
old <hi>Blefuſcudian</hi>: Theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,
joined to an undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
forward Spirit, and a few
good Friends, prevail'd with the
Emperor's Grandfather to make
him Keeper of his Library, and
a <hi>Mulro</hi> in the <hi>Gomflaſtru</hi>; tho'
moſt Men thought him fitter to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0080201500:22"/>
be one of the Royal Guards.
Theſe Places ſoon helped him
to Riches, and upon the Strength
of them he ſoon began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
every Body, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
by every Body. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
him in many Quarrels,
which he managed in a very odd
manner; whenever he thought
himſelf affronted, he immediately
flung a great Book at his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,
and, if he could, fell'd
him to the Earth; but if his
Adverſary ſtood his Ground and
flung another Book at him,
which was ſometimes done with
great Violence, then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
to the Grand Juſticiary,
that theſe Affronts were deſigned
to the Emperor, and that he was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0080201500:23"/>
ſingled out only as being the
Emperor's Servant. By this
Trick he got that Great Officer
to favour him, which made his
Enemies Cautious, and him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent.</p>
            <p>BULLUM attended the Court
ſome Years, but could not get
into an higher Poſt; for though
he conſtantly wore the Heels of
his Shoes High or Low, as the
Faſhion was, yet having a long
Back and a ſtiff Neck, he never
could, with any dexterity, creep
under the Stick, which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
or the Chief Miniſter held.
As to his dancing on the Rope,
I ſhall ſpeak of it preſently;
but the greateſt Skill at that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0080201500:24"/>
Art will not procure a Man a
Place at Court, without ſome
Agility at the Stick.</p>
            <p>BULLUM, vexed at theſe
Diſappointments, withdrew from
Court, and only appeared there
upon extraordinary Occaſions, at
other Times he retired to his
Poſt of <hi>Mulro</hi> in the <hi>Gomflatu,</hi>
there he led a gloomy ſolitary
Life, heaped up Wealth, and
pored upon the old <hi>Blefuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Books. It might have been
expected, that from ſo long an
Acquaintance with thoſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Writers, he ſhould have
grown more Polite and Humane;
but his Manner was never to
regard the Sence or Subject of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0080201500:25"/>
the Author, but only the Shape
of the Letters, in which he
arrived to ſuch Perfection, that,
as I have been aſſured, he
could tell, very near, in what
Year of the <hi>Blefuſcudian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
any Book was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
and to this, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
the old Characters that
were effaced, all his Labour
was confined.</p>
            <p>UPON theſe Points he had
wrote ſeveral Books, ſome in
the <hi>Blefuſcudian,</hi> and ſome in
the mixed Language; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he had finiſhed a Book,
he preſented it to ſome Great
Man at Court, with a Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Oration; ſo contrived that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0080201500:26"/>
it would fit any Man in a great
Poſt; and the higheſt Bidder
had it.</p>
            <p>WHILST I was in <hi>Lilliput,</hi>
he propoſed to publiſh a new
<hi>Blundecral</hi> of <hi>Alcoran</hi>; and, that
he might do ſomething uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
he began at the End, and
deſigned to have wrote back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
but the <hi>Lilliputians,</hi>
ſome liking the old <hi>Blundecral,</hi>
others not caring for any, gave
him no encouragement; and
therefore he deſiſted from that
Project.</p>
            <p>As this Nation was very
much divided about breaking
their Eggs, which they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0080201500:27"/>
eat in Publick once a Day,
or at leaſt once in Seven Days,
I deſired to know how BUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUM
behaved himſelf in this
particular; and was told,
That he was thought to have
an Averſion to Eggs, for he
was never ſeen to eat any in
Publick, but once or twice in a
Year, when his Poſt obliged him
to it: At thoſe Times he gave
Orders to have them ſerved up
to him ready Dreſſed, and the
Shells and Whites being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
taken off, he gulped up
the Yolks in a very indecent
manner, and immediately drank
a Bumper of ſtrong Liquor after
them, to waſh the Taſte out
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0080201500:28"/>
of his Mouth, and promote the
Digeſtion of them.</p>
            <p>WHEN any one repreſented
to him the ill Example of this
Practice, his Anſwer was, That
his Modeſty would not let him
devour Eggs in Publick, when
he had ſo many Eyes upon
him; That he was not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
at which End he ought
to break them; That the Shells
and Whites were inſipid, and only
fit for Children; But for the
Eggs themſelves, he was ſo far
from hating them, that he had
a Diſh at his own Table every
Day. But whether this was
Truth, or if they were at
his Table, whether he eat of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0080201500:29"/>
them or not, I could never
learn.</p>
            <p>BULLUM was always of an
haughty Mind, and, in his own
School, took a great deal of
Pleaſure in mimicking the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Emperor. Thus,
he got a little Stick and uſed
to divert himſelf in ſeeing his
Scholars leap over, and creep
under it, as he held it between
his Hands. Thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
beſt, were rewarded,
ſometimes, with a pompous
Title in the old <hi>Blefuſcudian</hi>
Language, ſignifying, MOST
LEARNED, MOST FAMOUS,
MOST ACCOMPLISHED YOUTH,
or the like: Sometimes with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0080201500:30"/>
little Sugar-Plums; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
only with the Promiſe of
them.</p>
            <p>IN dancing on the Ropes
he took great delight himſelf;
and this was the only Bodily
Exerciſe he uſed. Thoſe who
had been Eye-witneſſes, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, that he could cut a
Caper very high, but that he
did it in a clumſy manner,
and with little delight to the
Spectators, who were in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
apprehenſions of his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which ſometimes he did
very dangerouſly.</p>
            <p>IT was obſerved, that he
danced beſt in his own Houſe,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0080201500:31"/>
but that he never danced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Gomflaſtru</hi> with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
When he firſt came to
his Place of <hi>Mulro,</hi> he did
nothing but Dance and cut
Capers on the Ropes, for a
Year together: As this was
a new Sport in that Part of
the Iſland, he got a great deal
of Money by it; but ſtriving
to leap higher than ordinary,
he fell off from the Rope,
broke his Head, and diſordered
his Brain ſo much, that moſt
People thought it would inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate
him for his Poſt of
<hi>Mulro:</hi> However, at length,
he pretty well recovered; he
himſelf ſays, he is as well,
or better, than he was before
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0080201500:32"/>
his Fall: But his Enemies
think his Brain is ſtill affected
by it.</p>
            <p>SOME Years after, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Emperor, in a Progreſs
through his Dominions, came
to the <hi>Gomflaſtru</hi>; and BUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUM,
without being aſked, was
reſolved to divert His Majeſty
with his Performance on the
Strait-Rope; up he mounts, and
Capers bravely, for ſome time;
at laſt, endeavouring to ſhew
the utmoſt of his Skill, in the
midſt of an high Caper, he
reached out his Right-Hand too
far, which gave him a terrible
Fall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0080201500:33"/>
MOST People imputed it to
his Over-reaching himſelf; but
he laid the Fault partly upon
the Robes he was obliged to
wear before the Emperour,
which, as he ſaid, entangled
his Feet; and partly upon the
maliciouſneſs of a Bye-ſtander,
whom he accuſed of pulling
the Rope aſide, as he was in
the midſt of his Caper: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that was, poor BULLUM
broke his Leg, and was carried
to his own Houſe, where he
continued Lame above Two
Years, not being able to ſhew
himſelf in Publick all that Time;
and it was thought he would
never have recovered, if the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0080201500:34"/>
Emperor at laſt, had not taken
pity on him, and ſent one of
his own Surgeons to him, who
cured him immediately.</p>
            <p>AFTER all theſe Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
BULLUM could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
his beloved Diverſion, but
as ſoon as he was recovered,
he forgot all that was paſt,
and danced again in his own
School every Day; where, by
his frequent Falls he ſo bruiſed
himſelf, that it was believed
they would come to a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification:
Beſides, he dances
ſo long upon the ſame Rope,
that through Age and Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and his great Weight, it
muſt break at laſt; and the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0080201500:35"/>
Emperor would ſcarce lend him
a Surgeon a ſecond Time; which
indeed would be in vain, for
he can never leave off the
Sport, though he performs worſe
and worſe every Day; ſo that,
in all probability, he will break
his Neck for a Concluſion.</p>
